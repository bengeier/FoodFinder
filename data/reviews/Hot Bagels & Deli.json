{"text":"great spot, excellent food. live across the street and stop in a couple times a week. always fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Ah, Glendale's not hidden gem! I grew up eating Hot Bagels and I'm so happy to see they have expanded! My favorite bagel place! The breakfast sandwiches are delicious and so fresh. They cook the eggs as you order them and use their delicious homemade bagels. So yummy! I've also had their breakfast burrito, which is amazing as well. And their deli sandwiches are very good quality, use Boar's head meat.   This place is very reasonably price and they offer quality made food, as well. Plus the staff and owners are great people!"}
{"text":"I had an everything bagel and lox on cream cheese with capers, onion & tomato. The inside was great and generously stuffed. The bagel however was one of the worst I can remember suffering through. Flavorless, gummy mess. Einsteins are far, far superior. Back  to Einstein for me."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! The bagels are great and the sandwiches are a great deal for a combo! Would recommend"}
{"text":"Am I back in NJ??? I almost thought so after purchasing a dozen bagels for take-home after eagerly awaiting this Bagel spot to open. Yes, they are the same bagels I grew up on back east -- big, chewey yet crisp and full of seeds -- unmatched by any other bagel shop I've tried in AZ. So why not 5 stars? I still have to try their other items, and see how open they are to suggestions of making other types of bagels -- a black Russian??"}
{"text":"Yummy food great prices!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wish the location was bigger so could go as a group. Limited seating but fast service."}
{"text":"Might I suggest you order a bagel.   Hot or cold, they are all delicious and not badly priced"}
{"text":"Bagels available 365 days a year!!  This place is the best bagel place in Glendale. Great deli lunch sandwiches too. Family owned, and close to MWU."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, always incredibly fast.  The fresh bagels are delicious."}
{"text":"Have been going to Hot Bagels locations for over 10 years. Great breakfast and lunch. Never had a bad experience. A North Phoenix staple"}
{"text":"Is there a way to rate with negative stars? This place tastes great but the owners there are rude. Every time I pay, they some how end up charging me a dollar extra with every order and when you question it they play that language barrier BS. The woman is the worst one. She'll throw your Change with attitude when you ask her why you're being charged.  Hygiene there is also a bit sketchy. They don't wash their hands when they swap out the garbage. They just start making bagels. I'm done there."}
{"text":"Bought baker's dozen at 6.45am, asked if bagels were hot. Sidestepped my question & said they were made that morning. Bagels were cold, overly dense & toasting didn't even help. Obviously from the day before, if you're expecting Einstein's, do not come here."}
{"text":"Hands down best salmon bagel EVER I seriously can eat here 24/7 Customer service was pretty good too! Didn't really like them talking about their personal business tho. But their delicious bagels make up for it"}
{"text":"Got our food fast, tasted good. Always friendly staff and a smile. Coffee is good and hot. Stop by here whenever I can for breakfast."}
{"text":"When I know we are not going to have time for lunch I BEG my husband to stop here on our way to work.  Friendly staff and they remember what I like even when its been a while since my last time there.  Decently priced too!!"}
{"text":"Amazing freshly made begales, fast service and great price !! A must try . Going to come back for a dozen for lox and beagles and share with my family over thanksgiving the manager is very attentive, thanks Lela for being very nice"}
{"text":"Went this morning for the first--and last--time. I wanted onion bagels and would have bought a dozen if they had that many but they had only 6 left and it was only 10:00 AM. I did notice that they were too large for bagels--not a good thing. But, it was my first time and maybe 6 was enough to try the bagels for the first time. I went home and was looking forward to a bite of a fresh, hot bagel. Impressions: 1. Not hot; not even warm. 2. Not fresh, tasted like yesterday's (ah, so that's why there were only 6 left). 3. Way too big for a bagel, more like a roll with a hole in the middle. 4. Deli? Not even close. Obviously, the owner has never been to a real deli. My suggestion to him: spend a few days in NYC visiting and eating at real delicatessens, then come back to Phoenix and replicate, but better bring back an experienced deli manager also. Short of that, close the shop; you're embarrassing yourself and real deli operators everywhere. For me, I will contin ue the search for real bagels in Phoenix; not hopeful."}
{"text":"Bagels are fresh and so delicious here.  I'm a fan of their Lox on an everything bagel.  My family enjoys their breakfast deals... Bagel w/ egg and sausage plus drink/coffee for $5.. Can't beat that.    I'm hungry just thinking about it.  You should really try this if you're in the neighborhood!!!  Coffee isn't the best, but you have a Starbucks next door if that's the case..."}
{"text":"My Favorite Bagel place! They are very very generous with portions and sizes! They are also quick and freshest bagels and cream cheese! Also friendly staff!! Love love love this place!!"}
{"text":"Lox, Egg & Onion bagel:   Why would anyone in their right mind FULLY COOKED a lox on a bagel?!?!?!  Perhaps it is a special, so we ordered a Lox, Cream Cheese on Bagel....  Guess what, STILL GOT IT WRONG.  Seriously, they got good ingredients but they managed to butchered it to the point of eating cardboard, or worse.  I weep as I put a piece of perfectly smoked lox but was cooked to oblivion in my mouth for breakfast.  Ready to see perhaps I got it all wrong, tried their Lox, Egg & Onion, I felt like I was eating nutrient cube: the protein and carb were there, but I did not taste anything that resembled favors."}
{"text":"Great local bagel shop!   Very fast and friendly and the food is really good.  We  usually go on the weekend to get bagel breakfast sandwiches for the whole family.  The suite is very small so we usually just get them to go - I would recommend anyone looking for fast service and really good food to try them out."}
{"text":"The food is always good and they are super fast in processing time. We go here about once every two weeks for breakfast on the weekends. We only get carry out because it's always packed and there is no where to stand or sit most of the time and that would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"best bagels in the West Valley owners are awesome sometimes the lunch crowd can be crazy but well worth the wait keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Best bagel and breakfast sandwich I have had in Phoenix area.  Scrumptous."}
{"text":"Love this place! Feels like being in NY. Their bagels are delicious and the women working there are very sweet! Love to support locally owned businesses!!"}
{"text":"We were there this morning and after we placed our large to go order I noticed that every table was dirty and we wanted to sit and wait for our order. The man behind the counter was busy and I waited for someone to clean a table. I eventually asked for a towel so that I could clean off a table for us and the man behind the counter asked if our order was to go or not. I said that it was to go. And he responded with \" then you don't need a clean table\" disgusting! I'll never be back."}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop and grab some brunch after a morning hike! I got the lox and cream cheese bagel. It was very yummy. The place is small but the bagels are delicious! The staff was very friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"I rather enjoyed my experience here. Mom and pop bagel place trying to make it. The other reviews seem petty about not getting 5 star restaurant experience. It's good bagels, good food, friendly experience. I liked it enough to want to put 5 stars to better their review."}
{"text":"I always have loved this place!! Great bagels and great service. It's always busy for a reason :)"}
{"text":"Bagels are average at best, very stingy here. No ketchup packets anywhere just one nasty bottle that everyone has to touch. The worst part about it is the people working here seem to have the biggest attitude, won't be going back here. Dude who runs the register needs to find a different job that doesn't involve ANY customer interaction."}
{"text":"I've heard good things of this place. I'm not much of a breakfast place but I do enjoy a good bagel and great Homestyle's fries/ hashbrowns. 10:15 am The first three bagels I wanted to get they didn't have them okay cool I'll try something els.. and get hash browns to make a difference... sorry guys but I asked if my bagel would be tossed... and it's not. Home style ff could be cook more"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Been going to Hot Bagels for over 10 years now. Glad they finally opened up a 2nd location. I get their Hot Turkey Club Sandwich."}
{"text":"Any type of fresh bagel and bagel sandwich you can think of. They are always fresh and use only boars head meats and cheeses. New York style deli that is simply delicious."}
{"text":"Great food!!! However I just watched a worker push his hand into the garbage to make more room and then proceed back behind the counter to make someone's sandwich without washing his hands first no thanks."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Excellent bagels.  A restaurant shouldn't solely be reviewed on the food they serve alone. That is why I gave Hot Bagels on 59th Ave 2 stars. Although the bagels are amazing, the customer service is very poor. Next time I will send in someone else to purchase a bagel for me."}
{"text":"If they mess up your order, they don't care. They'll look at you like a deer in the headlights. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! don't eat here"}
{"text":"Just stopped by because i was at the tire shop. This place is amazing i just stumbled on it. It is so good. Bagels are very fresh. The atmosphere is genuine and happy. The selection of cream cheese is delectable. They have all Boars Head meats and cheeses. The price is very reasonable i believe."}
{"text":"The map looks a little different then the actual location, essentially it is right off Bell in the corner of the shopping plaza by the mattress place. i know a few regulars and they absolutely love it. i have been there several times myself and the bagels are fresh and made every morning. the staff is very friendly and will run all kinds of customizations for you. the prices are very reasonable and they are a breakfast and lunch place only; and on the weekends there can be a descent size line for the 10 o'clock bagel rush."}
{"text":"Great bagels and the food is cooked to order."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Lots of options, and the staff is always extremely friendly. My go-to when I want to grab a bagel. The only negative is I wish they didn't use styrofoam plates and cups, but I'm a tree-hugging hippie. Support small business and check them out!"}
{"text":"Excellent boar's head turkey bagel sandwiches with Mountain Dew/styrofoam cups. Always quick service"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after coming out of the bank one early morning. You dont see much non franchise bagel delis so I was excited for some fresh baked bagels. Upon entering you notice a pissed off individual behind the counter. I ordered a few bagels togo and then had some questions about what the best sandwich they had was, the guy behind the counter seemed angry and asked the people behind me if he could help them while im in the middle of trying to order, pretty rude. So I get my sandwich and bagels and head on home. The wife had been craving bagels, we were excited. After a few bites she says that they taste weird and I noticed they were stale and seemed a few days old. Thinking about it i cant remember ever having a bad bagel before this. Its a shame, later that night I open up my sandwich and it is literally on the cheapest skinniest white bread you could find. Arent bakeries supposed to have skill in baking fine breads? I would rather get a sandwich for a gas station. Overall not one good thing about this place besides I didnt get sick."}
{"text":"These are the only bagels I truly crave.  I'll eat just about any bagel, but these are truly what bagels should be.  They are a two layer treat -- a well-done outer \"shell\" with an appropriately gluteny, chewy, yet not-too-dense center.  I've never ventured beyond the bagels to explore the rest of the menu since the bagels themselves are so perfect.  The service is always wonderful and quite quick, so don't think you can place an order and make it over the the Starbucks and back, because you won't have to wait even that long.  Regulars and new patrons are treated equally well.  My recommendation is an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on either the salt or sesame bagel.  Then get another bagel to go, because you'll definitely want one later."}
{"text":"I've always passed this place for a couple years, and always told myself to give it a try sometime. So couple years later I finally tried it, and boy did I wish I tried this place earlier. I have become addicted to this place. I got atleast twice a week before I head off to school. Taylor Ham, egg and cheese on asiago cheese bagel that all I get and its perfect. Bagels have ton of flavor and terrific texture. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"A great deli (great bagels too, but I go there for the deli). A very small place and the food is always good & fresh. They'll do all kinds of custom orders. They cook your order quickly so you'll be in and out in minutes. Low prices and sandwich comes with a drink & chips. Awesome & friendly staff.   My *favorite* deli in Surprise."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've driven past here for years and didn't stop by 'til now. The exterior is non-assuming, but upon pulling up, I couldn't believe how packed it was! That's a good sign...  We shared the chorizo burrito and a ham, egg and cheese garlic bagel. Pork lovers unite. Including the one coffee that came with the bagel, this breakfast for two came to $10 total and we were definitely satiated.   The food and coffee are simple fare, but the bagel was amazing and soooo very fresh. In fact, they had so many bagel options to choose from that is was hard to decide! And freshest looking bagels I've seen in the area. (Beware vampires: the garlic bagel is almost overpoweringly strong, but I love garlic so no complaints here.)   Popular Sunday morning place, quick service, good prices, and, most of all, tasty food."}
{"text":"This place is alright if you are looking for the fast food alt. , the quality is hit or miss. I usually route for a place like this big time , but like I said its not consistent at all ! Two of the three people that work there are rude and very unfriendly , and need to smile ! If they work on those two problems and stay open a little later this place would be all aces !"}
{"text":"All top quality at this spot ! Love the egg sausage and cheese breakfast bagel... Very friendly staff also"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for YEARS and it has always been great. Very courteous staff. Fast service. Cheap prices. Amazing taste."}
{"text":"Efficient, consistent and delicious.  Heading to work and I was borderline hangry. Hot bagels was a quick fix. I had but minutes to get to work. I managed to park, order , pay, get my coffee and a bagel in under five minutes. Great job Hot Bagels!"}
{"text":"Just got home with a dozen bagels. I can't make this up when I tell you not ONE but TWO bagels had human hair in them. Wear a freaking hair net. Flipping disgusting."}
{"text":"Going downhill.  Had a sausage egg and cheese bagel here the past 2 times, and the sausage and egg are each the thickness of a slice of American cheese.  It was food while it lasted.  Cutting corners has lost my business here.  Never again...."}
{"text":"The five stars are for the food, not the service. The majority of the cashiers here are careless, rude and bland. Every time I come here, I order the same thing for me and my fiancé - two lox on everything bagels: one without onions, one without onions and tomatoes. They never seem to understand this order until I say what I DO want on them, instead of what I DON'T want. I actually once made sure to place my order by saying what I DID want on them, as opposed to the usual, and it was the same story. This is rather frustrating. Aside from that, I absolutely love the food here. Perhaps I will order online from now on.."}
{"text":"Fast Friendly service every time! The bagel sandwich's are amazing! My Favorite is the Egg Salad on the garlic bagel!"}
{"text":"The food is ok the prices are a bit on the high side and they could definitely use some help on keeping the place clean tables were dirty garbage on the floor"}
{"text":"Great bagels. Friendly staff. Just wish they had cheddar bagels. They also need larger seating area."}
{"text":"Always a great stop. I have eaten here numerous times and every time has been great. Fast service and friendly staff. Not a ton of seating and the place is usually cranking out bagels and sandwiches. The breakfast bagels are great and come out fast!!  I will continue to be a customer here. If you haven't stopped here you are cheating yourself."}
{"text":"I ordered the lox and onion on wheat bagel, and instead got cooked salmon and onions on hard cardboard that's suppose to resemble a wheat bagel. Who heats up a bagel with lox on it???????? I understand if you toast up my bagel, but it certainly defeats the purpose of ordering lox if you're going to cook my fish. Not only was the food unappetizing, but what happened while I was waiting for my bagel made me want to walk out of the store and never come back. Maybe I should have to save my taste buds from such unpleasantry. As I was watching a worker butcher my food, another was sweeping and gathering all the crap on the floor, while a rack full of bagels that are meant to be sold to customers were a mere few feet away! At one point, all the dust, crumbs, garbage, bacteria, and who knows what else was on that floor were mere inches away from the bagel! If only a health inspector was there to witness such atrocities! I was seriously cringing inside thinking of all the bacterial spores and pathogens that were now airborne and adhering to the food. Does food poisoning and illnesses come to anyone's minds? This place is disgusting and needs to be paid a visit by the city's health inspector!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here after our morning walk almost since they first opened. The bagel breakfast are very good and the prices are good. I think this is pretty much a family run business and they are friendly and efficient   It gets a little crowded some mornings and I have noticed lately that they seem to have become a little lax on keeping the table area clean   W usually have to clean our own table.  Also it is pretty warm eating inside because of the location of the grill   The should keep it a little cooler. You can eat outside but the sun is a little in your face in the mornings.  Bout all in all a great little asset to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst bagels + cream cheese I have ever had.   Ordered blueberry and everything bagel, both with lite cream cheese (yes, lame). I requested it to be toasted, it was not. Both bagels were dry, plain, and very disappointing. And they put WAY to much cream cheese on.   Maybe I went wrong with not getting a breakfast sandwich but if you can't nail the basics, you are done for. See attchaed pics for, err, the bagel that came with my cream cheese."}
{"text":"There 15 min for 4 bagels.  Cancelled my order. Cashier didnt say a word. Opened the register and put money on their table !. None of them wear gloves. Lady is yelling g at their other girls. People waiting for their order. I won't go back  ever. What a mess they have going on."}
{"text":"Love their warm blueberry bagels! They know how to make them just right with the crunch on the outside and the soft doughy inside! I'm also a huge fan of their cream cheese! It's thick like it should be!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most delicious bagels ever. Closest to New York style bagels ever. A++++ for sure."}
{"text":"The best tasting Bagels like you only get back East! Always fast and friendly service thanks!"}
{"text":"Kick ass bagels. My personal favorites are the lox and the ruben. I go to school right across the street and when i need something fast and delicious this place always delivers!"}
{"text":"Hot Bagels has the best breakfast bagels and bagel lunch sandwiches!  Their prices are reasonable and service is super fast.  I only wish they had opened by us in Stetson!"}
{"text":"Lady cashier (manager?) tried to play dumb and charge me $5.25 for the breakfast special even after I reminded her that it was $4.40. Worst part? The bagel was dry. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Not the best customer service, more into their conversations than talking to you but the food is damn good!"}
{"text":"This place has the best deals on delicious bagel sandwiches. The service is always friendly and there is great variety. Yummy coffee too!"}
{"text":"When I worked at Staples, this place made me want to come to work. I love their breakfast sandwiches so much! I usually get the egg, sausage, and cheese. Their coffee is also super good. Their lunch sandwich special is also amazing! They pack on the meat and cheese, so obviously I do not mind paying a little more to get this instead of Subway.   For some reason, the bagels and cream cheese seem to lose their appeal. I do not think there is anything special about them by themselves. Also, it can often be difficult to find a seat inside, but it is fun to sit outside when the weather's nice!   The staff is always super friendly and happy!"}
{"text":"Hot Bagels. To a random passerby, it's like any bagel place really. To locals and Midwestern students, it's a holy temple. And to me, well it's a highly overrated bagel place. But hey, it's still delicious! Especially if you're in the mood for a bagel.  But it's kinda pricey. I ultimately paid like $8 for a bagel with lox, cream cheese, and a bag of chips. Seriously?? I mean, yes, it was one of the best bagels I've ever had but I could've gone next door to Senor Taco and gotten a burrito for $3 less and have enough for a dry-cleaning job at the $2.25 cleaners adjacent!  And that's what brings this place down. While bagels are delicious and it's hard to mess up bagels, it's still just a bagel. So if you're feeling like having a bagel, definitely check this place out. It's on par with or better than Einstein Bros. Just don't be overhyped by all the love the locals have for this place because in the end, you're just having a bagel. =)"}
{"text":"Best bagel place ever. I would go there atleast 2-3 times a week in highschool, and now I make sure I go there whenever I am back home in AZ.   So delicious, everything bagel with butter is 2.00$ and so bomb!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to sit and have lunch with friends.  It's always busy but the service is fast.  Staff is very friendly, in fact, my daughter of 2 years use to go in with me all the time and they would always acknowledge her.  I never pay over $7 for breakfast or lunch, and the deli meat is excellent quality.  I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Best bagels, sandwiches and breakfast burritos in town! Excellent and fast customer service ! For sure a neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"Def a go to breakfast/lunch joint.  Good prices and great food.  Boars Head is always a big win.  If you need breakfast or a deli fix you can't go wrong here.."}
{"text":"This place is the best bagels place around. They make their bagels and their spreads from scratch in house and their prices a very reasonable. The service is always quick and efficient and I've been coming here for years. However, they can be heavy handed with the cream cheese."}
{"text":"This place is so far from New York it's a crime to even state it. We went here hoping to get a real New York breakfast sandwich and this location failed. Now being from New York I was expecting a 50% mimick however we do not get that. We were met with a breakfast sandwich that was 90% bread and 10% everything else. Not a good experience and definitely will not return."}
{"text":"Best. Bagels.....never go anywhere else.  Breakfast sandwiches are delicious.    You can also purchase meat for your home.   Lunch sandwiches are great.  They even have bagel dogs!"}
{"text":"Best NY Bagels in AZ hands down.. so glad it's close to my house."}
{"text":"We LOVE hot bagel, the food is delicious. We will go on the weekend and get the bagel, egg, meat and cheese.  The bagels have a nice taste and are a change from the store bought type."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since high school. Always fast, delicious and friendly helpful staff. I LOVE IT"}
{"text":"Superb bagel just wish they would cut back on the salt. Then I could patronize them more often."}
{"text":"Visited this place before getting coffee. I had a plain bagel with cream cheese and my husband had their pretzel bunned hot dog. We were both satisfied, and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast bagel option in surprise.  We have Einstein's around the corner and I choose this place every time.  Owners are personable and kind every time I  walk in.  They use Boar's Head deli meats which is awesome.  They have a decent selection of bagel types.  As well they serve lunch.  Just give them a whirl, you shouldn't regret it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to get a dozen bagels ( different variety), we waited for the cashier to finish with the prior customer before we spoke to him about what we wanted to order. When it was our turn my husband asked what the price of a dozen bagels would be, and then we proceeded to place our order. The Cashier then asked us if he could help another customer behind us first? I don't know what to think about that, as I thought we were right in the middle of placing our order! Never the less you never know what a person is going through, so we  won't harp on it! Blessings to their business for the future!"}
{"text":"Bacon, egg, and cheese on a garlic bagel toasted. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Every time the same experience:  extraordinarily rude owners who get simple orders wrong. Last time, I ordered lox and cream cheese on a bagel.  I got a bagel with lox and NO cream cheese.  Today i ordered 2 bagels with lox and cream cheese.  The owner reached for 1 bagel and began to WEIGH the lox. I watched. I spoke up again, \"2 bagels with lox and cream cheese, please.\" The owner kept working.  She put the 1 bagel into a bag, turned around and began to work the cash register.  I said now for the 3rd time: \"I'd like 2 bagels with lox and cream cheese, please.\"  She said: \"That is exactly what i gave you: a bagel with 2 slices of lox.\"  You just can't make this up.  The place is in the bagel business and they have ZERO idea how people eat bagels and what people want with their bagels. When the owner finally made me the 2nd bagel with lox and cream cheese, and after i had paid her, she said the words that every person who orders lox and cream cheese on a bagel is waiting to here:  \"Those come with potato chips.\""}
{"text":"This is a great NY style deli with delicious bagels, cream cheese, and lunch sandwiches. Its also extremely fast and cheap for when you are on your way to work in the morning. Highly recommend this place over any einstein bagel or chain."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town. Everything is tasty and filling. Always clean when I go in and the employees offer quick service which is convenient on both ends. I've been going here since they opened and I have never had a bad experience. Skip Einstein's and go here"}
{"text":"Our family really loves this place. It's more of a once in awhile place because it gets pricey for 4 of us. But it's so worth it every time we go. Only 4 stars because the service is a hit or miss. The gentleman up front isn't very friendly but not rude either by any means. I just feel when I'm  paying top dollar for a casual breakfast/ lunch meal the service should be something that takes it over the top. Still doesn't stop is though because it's so yummy and fresh :)"}
{"text":"Soooo good. My boyfriend and I typically get the Taylor ham breakfast bagel on Asiago. But this last time we had the sausage breakfast bagel on an everything bagel and it was amazing! And for $5 with a coffee or soda, you really can't go wrong. The staff is nice enough but their efficiency is hard to beat. I've never waited more than 5-7 minutes and to met it's worth the wait. Yummy! I'll keep going back here as long as I'm in the valley."}
{"text":"Looking for a hot tasty gourmet sandwich for a fair price? This is the place.   I come here weekly with my husband and am always impressed by their food.  I make an attempt to try a different sandwich each time I visit, and have yet to have a bad experience.  There are always customers there, many seem like regulars.  They are always sold out of the 'egg bagel' so I've never had a chance to try it, but it sounds interesting.  Last time in I ordered an onion bagel with onion/chive cream cheese to go.  They REALLY load it up with the cream cheese, definitely no skimping here!!    Looking for a hot tasty gourmet sandwich for a fair price? This is the place."}
{"text":"Hot Bagels, always my go to for a lox craving.  Generous portions of salmon, cream cheese, onions, and salty capers that burst in your mouth on your choice of bagel."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, and friendly! I love the homemade atmosphere they have created. Emphasis on super fast service!"}
{"text":"This is the best bagel shop in town! Great atmosphere and service. My favorite is the everything bagel. Their cream cheese is also the perfect consistency and is almost buttery."}
{"text":"We ate there this morning and it's quite the busy place. I would have to try more bagels before I give it 5 stars :) I had the ham and eggs on plain bagel and my husband had the bacon, egg, and cheese on everything bagel. They were so busy, they swapped out bagels so rather than complaining we just swapped them ourselves. I'd like to try something else that is not or was not on an everything bagel. The prices were pretty good. And they had a lot of choices to choose from. Also, forgot to mention there were two black hairs on my husband's bagel. It almost looked like black dog hairs."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly. Their bagel sandwich are delicious. Real fresh compared to Einstein's. Hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"*Review by proxy*  Strawberry cream cheese should not look like pepto bismol.  Abby said bubble gum but I don't think that's pink enough.  Yet still no flavor.  The bagels were mediocre, the only thing it had going for it was convenience.  *dictated to hubby over the phone*"}
{"text":"for a simple deli joint, this place is one of the best! i come in all the time with my friends and then served and in my car again in less than 5 minuets. they take their food serious and make is unbelievably savory."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels.  Great crunchy crust,soft tender inside. Bought a dozen to go and the price was under 10.00.  It is a little cute shop that is obviously being run by the owner who can multi task really well.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"They are so rude there!!! They are ignorant and randomly charge extra without any explanation to why. Every time I go in there the male and female are fighting. The bagels are great, but way over priced."}
{"text":"Great service, food and prices. The deli is small maybe because it was full of customers! They had nice clean patio tables outside. The bagels were good. We ate an everything and a wheat. I ordered a cinnamon raisin for later :)"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite ! The owner and his family are very friendly and it's some of the best food I ever had. It's a hole in the wall. I love supporting this small business. : )"}
{"text":"Best bagel I've ever had! Cooked fresh everyday. Their homemade strawberry cream cheese is a must try- it's hot pink and it tastes as good as it looks!!!"}
{"text":"Always when I need a good bagel fix there this is the place to go. Weather it's a regular with cream cheese or a combo hot pastrami on everything, it can't be beat. Always friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"One of the grossest ham, egg and cheese breakfast burritos I've ever had. The location on Carefree Hwy makes this breakfast burrito to perfection every time, and they even have potatoes in it. Learn how to make a breakfast burrito from the Carefree location, thats all im going to say. The experience this morning was disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been living in Surprise for just under a year now but only today discovered Hot Bagels & Deli. YUM!!!! I am a hard core bagel fan. A bagel junkie if you will. I love these bagels.Hard outer shell and tender and chewey on the inside. My husband, a hard core yankee from back east, told me these were true east coast bagels. Great selection. The only thing that could have been improved upon was they only had a couple left of more than a few of the bagels. I also got cream cheese which was light and fluffy. They aquired two new regular customers today."}
{"text":"Grabbed a dozen bagels and spread for a gathering and was so impressed with the freshness and service I just had to add a review. The most authentic bagels on the west side. Try 'em and you'll never be able to try another place."}
{"text":"So Hot Bagels has convenient locations, great food (especially breakfast bagel sandwiches), decent coffee (Kona), and just ok service. I stop here 2-3 times a week minimum and I can count on them messing up the order at least once a week. Last 3 mistakes were: not doubling the meat on the breakfast bagel when it was ordered (and paid) with double meat, putting regular ham on the sandwich instead of Taylor ham as ordered, and forgetting to include the coffee cake when it was ordered. All of these were on \"to-go\" orders - so be sure to check your order before you leave the store. The quality of the food makes the mistakes easy to look past, but improving their service would definitely get them the 5 star rating they're capable of getting."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend, she tried to use her loyalty points, the girl basically grabbed the iPad out of her hand and said \"we don't to points on the weekend\". Really??? You only want loyal customers on weekdays?   I got the lox, tomato, caper, onion sandwich...2 things made me know these people do not make real NY/NJ bagels....they use white onions instead of red, and they wanted to toast my bagel that cold fish would be going on.  Fucking gross.  Between the rude chick with Midwestern hair & white onions with my lox this place deserves 1 star."}
{"text":"Great eats, fast service. Good place for a quick bite. Ham and cheese on asiago is my favorite."}
{"text":"I like to contribute to small businesses and since this is a mom and pop type place, I went here about 1-3 times a week for a few months straight. I'd usually have the same order each time, the breakfast burrito, but occasionally I'd changed it up. The food was decent, but despite my regular business to the establishment and my attempts to be friendly with the owners, they acted like they were better than their customers. This should have been my first clue, but I just chalked it off, simply as cultural differences. As I continued to go there, I noticed my usual order had a slightly different price each time!! One day, after ordering, I ended up calculating it right there on the spot and discovered an 85 cent discrepancy. I then realized I had been getting screwed by 50-95 cents each order nearly every time I had previously been there!! I was pissed and pointed it out. The guy actually had the nerve to tell me \"it's only 85 cents\" I told him it was 85 cents multiplied by all the other times I'd been in there!! I wondered how many other unsuspecting customers he was also screwing regularly. I cancelled my order, got my money back, and will never return!! Its a shame because I really wanted this to be a regular spot for my breakfast."}
{"text":"Oh yeah my peeps these bagels are mighty delicious ! Grab your buds and head on over to Hot Bagels ... FYI don't delay the bagels go fast and they are always busy ! If you go let me know what you think . Enjoy"}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast in the valley. Bagels reminiscent of NYC. And, Taylor ham, egg and cheese. Out of this world."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Hot Bagels! They have the BEST bagels and deli around! If you need a quick hot breakfast than this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   Walked in and it was packed full and a line out to the door (it is a small place but still). I stayed because the line moved along so quickly, they definitely have a good process down here!  I ordered a bacon (extra crispy please), egg, and cheese on a wheat bagel, and a small coffee. It was delicious! The bagel was fresh and soft, the egg was in fact a real egg, and then bacon crispy as I had requested. So good. The coffee was super! I am picky but it was piping hot and just great. They have self serve coffee- best dark and kona. I like light coffee so I did the kona. They have cream out but no milk, so I asked if they had any and the girl was happy to get me some in the back, despite being slammed this Saturday morning (I felt bad, but she was so friendly). The food came out in about 5 min.   My bagel and coffee was a little over $7, but it was well worth it (especially considering a Starbucks coffee costing 5-6-7 in some cases). Everything was superb- food and service.   Will definitely be back! In fact, they have a breakfast special Monday-Friday 5:30-11am for a meat, egg, and cheese sandwich with a coffee or soda for $5.25 plus tax, great deal!  They also have many other sandwiches that I am excited to try, they all sound amazing. This place uses Boar's head meat so you know it will be great quality. They even have a bagel with PB&J for only $2.50, amazing!   Overall I am just really impressed with this place, it's a real gem. In a plaza, you might miss it if you didn't find it on Yelp or another source. If you're looking for a breakfast/lunch spot, it is a MUST. Affordable, delicious, and great atmosphere/service."}
{"text":"This place definitely has made from scratch bagels which is good. However, they were pretty salty. I'm not talking just the savory ones, but also the sweet. My blueberry bagel was as salty as my garlic one. Also it should be noted that the so-called \"blueberry\" bagel didn't actually appear to contain any blueberries, but rather blue food coloring to make it appear bluish. Meh... In addition, the staff was not the most helpful. The woman at the register mumbled a \"hello\" but that was about all she said to us. She was not friendly at all so it's no surprise that other people have mentioned the poor customer service as well."}
{"text":"Great food, freshly made, mostly women work there that's showing you who is the boss ;) I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is OK, but service was not great. Kitchen staff was having a loud argument and then they started arguing with someone over the phone as well. It was not relaxing at all and frankly haven't been back since."}
{"text":"I find it very interesting that they use American cheese on their bagel sandwiches, even though they are a deli. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are decent but the American cheese really throws me off. It's always very quick and the staff is always friendly. Better than grocery store pre packaged bagels but I've had better. I also like my bagels toasted but I feel like they don't keep them in the toaster long enough because when I take a bite, it is just warm, but still more chewy than crispy. Overall a decent place for a quick bagel.."}
{"text":"Grew up with a locally owned bagel shop in my home town and have since been on a personal mission to find a bagel shop resembling. This place may be it! Perfect bagels with great simultaneous crunch and chew. The homemade cream cheese is delicate, not too heavy. The chicken salad sandwich- a longed favorite of mine, was wonderful! I hear there can be long lines, and although we went on a quieter afternoon, they move so fast, I can't see it being a discouragement."}
{"text":"First time here, had Everything Bagel breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese. Pretty darn good if I don't say so myself."}
{"text":"First time coming here and would definitely come back. We picked up a sausage, egg, and cheese bagel and a lox and cream cheese bagel. Pretty decent sized bagel and it was nice and chewy. Their bagels are legit New York style bagels and worth the price."}
{"text":"I gave this place two tries just in case the first impression was skewed since I came late in the day. This is one of 3 locations of a local chain called  Hot Bagels and Deli. It's in the mall with the huge  Home Depot and cheap construction consultants for hire  in the parking lot. The parking right in front of this  place is a bit crowded and crazy during lunch time -  what with it also being home to Subway, Panda Express,  and Senor Taco as well. Lady who took my order had a  slight Central European accent. I had a bagel and a coffee. The coffee you just get from a coffee machine -  no different from what they have at your local Circle K. Both times the bagels were just ok. This last time my  bagel was a little doughy and a bit too salty. Oh well,  I guess I'll stick to Einstein Bros."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Stopped here one day for lunch after a hike on Thunderbird Mountain. Had the Reuben and LOVED it! Looks like everything in there is really fresh and would love to go back and try the bagels."}
{"text":"Best New York bagel's in town. Large variety  of cream cheese, best lox poppy bagel, best breakfast sandwiches, and lunch. Don't forget the bialis. I have been indulging in their delicious bagel's and sandwiches since they opened. I no longer miss New York, there Is no other bagel shop that is remotely close to them! Highly recommend to my friends and everyone who asks!"}
{"text":"Worth a visit but just ok.  We ordered a bacon, egg, bagel and a bagel with cream cheese.  The bagels were really dry and whoever prepped our order was very stingy with the cream cheese.  There was only cream cheese on one side of the bagel.  The temperature is hot and very uncomfortable.  Hopefully, this place uses their AC during the hot months."}
{"text":"Love this place the great people & customer service. The NY crumb cake and bagels are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Good place and delicious food! Great atmosphere for a quick breakfast or brunch and nice thick bagels. Good for bringing to the office or sitting down to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels and friendly staff! This is a great little bagel shop in Surprise and they give such big portions.  We ordered a couple breakfast bagels one on an everything and the other on a garlic bagel. Both were chewy and fresh. You can tell that they put a lot of love and effort in the bagels and it's nothing like the other bagel shops. We also ordered home fries and the portion was huge. It's definitely enough for two people to share. We will definitely come back and support this local bagel shop."}
{"text":"I go here 4-5 times a week. Their ingredients are great quality, they make the best breakfast sandwiches on earth, and the staff are always super friendly.   Try the ham, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel OR any of the lunch sandwiches on a sub roll. DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"If you want some plain fast food chain bagels you can get them right around the corner from this place. If you want New York style bagels then I recomend Hot Bagels & Deli.   These guys dont only have bagels they have a small kitchen where they make breakfast, burritos and sandwiches.   We decided to get some breakfast burritos, eat and take home some fresh made bagles. The burritos were bacon, egg, cheese and potato. This is a very plain burrito but one of the tastiest. It came with some salsa that was ok ( a little salty.) The burrito was great.   We ordered a dozen bagles to go with a 1/2 lb of strawberry cream cheese for the kids. We got home a I toasted some for for the kids. I tasted the rainbow one from my daughter and it was great. Soft on the inside and chewie on the outside.   So if your looking for a great place for bagels  out in Surprise, Hot Bagels & Deli is a great place for you."}
{"text":"Might be back for the bagels, but not for the annoying owner who tried to rip me off. I just read that the other two locations have original owners, so I will road trip that way for the boiled and then baked bagels. Not sure that an Albanian can make bagels anyway, but we know they don't care about customer service for sure. The dude was actually reading a newspaper at the register while waiting for me to decide what to order. After that, he \"forgot\" to give me a $5 for change after I handed him a $10 bill, only giving me 2 singles back on my $2.50 bagel. The final problem is this dude is making the food too, along with taking my order and giving me incorrect change. Did not see him washing his hands either. Sure, you can be a moron and own a restaurant too, but eventually that will catch up to you and let's hope Albania falls soon with his attitude. One star for the decent sesame bagel."}
{"text":"I come to Ben's Hot Bagels EVERY time I am in AZ. The pumpernickel bagel, toasted with olive pimento cream cheese is my absolute favorite flavor combination. It makes my mouth water just writing this. This is an authentic NY style bagel establishment in Surprise, AZ. Surprise... who would've guessed!? I haven't been able to find anything comparable in San Francisco, to my dismay. Be aware, they are heavy on the cream cheese, which I adore. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place but today was not a great experience for us. I feel like hot bagels is known for their taste and quantity of cream cheese. Today my bagel had a thin little layer and was barely toasted. We also got a LOX bagel so my husband and I each had half. I was saving my best bite for last and when I looked down, there was a thick, coarse hair that honestly looked like a pubic hair (pic below). I am so grossed out right now. I will NOT be returning"}
{"text":"I am long time customer ever since my high school days I would go to the original one on 101 and 59th Ave and I this one. Now I hate going to this one, there have several of times I come in to get the same thing I get all the time, it sounds very picky but I ask every time if they could put cream cheese on my bagel sounds pretty easy hence I'm at a bagel shop. When I get my bagel they never put it on and then I ask if they could please put it on and EVERYTIME the customer service is terrible they look at me like they don't speak English and raise a cup to my cream cheese in it. Like NO I paid you 12 dollars for a bagel sandwich make it the right way and stop being lazy.  It's really just not even place I go to anymore. The staff at the original is always top notch."}
{"text":"When in yesterday for a BLT with an egg on it, before I left I asked the gal if the egg was on it they said yes, was so excited to try it for the first time get back to work open it only to be disappointed there was no egg bumper, I called them explained what happened she apologized for it and said she would credit me a BLT with an egg on it. This morning I proceed to go and get a BLT with an egg on it and they said that they would not credit me that I would have to pay, for this tells me they're not willing to stand by their word they lied and they were rude on top of that no more hot bagels for me."}
{"text":"Good stuff...tho will overcharge you on items if you not careful - ie. If you ask for the combo bagel and drink, make sure you get charged for the combo price, vs the individual items. Finally, though, a breakfast place on Happy Valley in between 43rd and 67th ave."}
{"text":"Finally, a hot bagels by us up here on happy valley. Tasty tasty indeed!"}
{"text":"Well, it looks like the West Valley is good for something - bagels. These babies are the real deal and they also taste perfect out of the freezer as well. Boiled, then baked is the only way to make bagels and since this side of town lost a few places, the search was on for this NY item. Well, now the search is over. I have tried nothing else, but toasted, fresh or frozen, these bagels (some a bit odd shaped) are top notch."}
{"text":"Tried out their veggie burger sandwich with garlic. I loved how good the bagels tasted and they were definitely fresh. I also tried their coffee and desserts. Not bad. Their cinnamon roll with icing were pretty good."}
{"text":"I was early for a 1230 meeting at Home Depot, so I decided to see what was available, to eat.  I was so hungry, my stomach, thought my throat was slit.  I walked down the mall, because I knew there was a Subway around the corner.  Well, as I rounded the East corner of the strip mall, I saw this little Bagel place(Hot Bagels and Deli), and being the adventureous type, I walked in to try it out.  WOW, was I pleasantly surprised.  I was greeted, as soon as I walked in, and since I was new, they gave me some suggestions, that I was very thankful for.  I ordered some kind of hot turkey, on marbled rye, and as soon as I sunk teeth, I knew I was going back again.  The prices are just right, and so is the portion size.  As hungry as I was, I just about couldn't finish it.  Boars Head meats, are the best, and I look for their meats, whether it's in a deli or at the grocery store, to take home. Like I said above, I'll be frequenting this new little gem."}
{"text":"Love love love! Always busy in here but they are super fast and it's always super hot! I love coming here before going to the gym get a nice breakfast burrito. Yes a burrito at a bagel shop. Everything here is just amazing! The staff are friendly and always helpful. I perfect this location over the Happy Valley one because the staff there looks mad and not happy to work. Work is work be happy make me want to come back! This place is 100% a 5 out of 5 stars! The best fast breakfast place in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is incredible, no, it is BEYOND incredible! I thought these reviews must just be a bunch of hype for a place with such a simple name as \"Hot Bagels,\" boy was I wrong...  This is a New York / Eastern European style Bagel and Deli cafe. I have actually stopped going to all my usual weekend breakfast places being as anytime I have the time to get breakfast out, it's here. They have something for everyone. Their Lox and Bagels (both breakfast style and lunch style) are INSANELY good. All the bagel breakfast sandwiches are for that matter. In fact, they are so good that I don't even know how to describe them, which isn't a common sort of thing for me. The prices are very reasonable, for just a bagel and cream cheese you're looking at around 3 bucks and for one of the sandwiches around 5 bucks. Good food, good prices, super friendly service. This place goes above and beyond.  My only complaint is PLEASE EXPAND AND GET INTO A BIGGER STORE! Their food is SO incredibly good that droves of people make lines filtering out the doors all morning long and their little store front isn't big enough to handle the demand of all the people craving their delicious food, although I would wait in a burning hot lava pit if I had to for their food.  Eat here, you cannot and will not regret it. Their bagels will change your entire life and how you perceive breakfast forever..."}
{"text":"Being from NY I had high expectations based on a bunch of the reviews. Ordered the Taylor Ham, egg and cheese on a \"toasted\" everything bagel. Bagel was not toasted. Disappointing there. Like the simple setup of the place. Staff was at best moderately friendly. Smiles and hellos almost seemed forced rather than genuine which is the norm these days. Ive been in and still am in the restaurant industry for over 25 years. Amazing to me how so many managers and owners just don't get how important that piece is. Do you appreciate your guests or not?  Sorry. I digress. Anyway, overall not too bad. Prices about right. Guess I was expecting better. Might be back but not crazy about it."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels and sandwiches for everyone. Breakfast sandwich bagels, hefty scoops of schmear and a variety of bagel types to choose from so something to suit everyone. This place is always busy on weekends and mornings but the line to order goes quick and they are pretty on top of it when it comes to making the countless bagels and getting them out to customers within a 5-10 minute span. Even with all the commotion going on behind the counter, they manage to get the orders right. Only issue is they almost need a better system of getting customers the bagels other than shouting out the order. Have had no real issue with this, but someone who probably had a similar order, walked up and got our bagels when the order was called out as they don't verify receipt before handing the bag over. Maybe a numbering system would ensure people don't walk up and grab the wrong bag. Call out 37 instead of sausage and extra egg and cheese on everything toasted and a toasted plain sausage egg and cheese. Once we realized what happened, we waited a few more minutes to see if our order would in fact come out, and when it didn't, we simply told them we think someone took our bag and they checked the tickets waiting to be made and then asked what we ordered and expedited to the front. So even if this does happen, just let them know and they will make you a new set."}
{"text":"I will keep it simple and say these are the best Bagels in town, period. If you ever have an opportunity to go there for breakfast, my personal favorite is the poppy seed bagel with Taylor Ham, egg and cheese. But, there's a lot to choose from and the staff is very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"We usually like this place, but it seems that the quality has really drastically declined. I ordered an egg, cheese, and bacon sandwich, and the bacon seemed raw. Also, there was a very stingy portion of bacon (2 very small strips). The sandwich looked disgusting with that undercooked bacon so I brought it back to the counter and explained that the bacon was undercooked. Instead of just apologizing and making me a new sandwich, the person making the sandwich said: \"oh, so you wanted it crispy?\". I told them that I just wanted it cooked. I then told them to forget about the bacon, and just put ham on the sandwich since I was so grossed out by the undercooked bacon. Instead of just apologizing for the undercooked sandwich and for my inconvenience, the girls behind the counter all started to look at each other and whisper to one another about it. This is not a good way to retain customers....especially since we have been there so regularly. I really don't mind that they made me a bad sandwich, it was their reaction that really turned me off. Also, the coffee was cold and pretty crappy.  On a lighter note, their bagels are always awesome."}
{"text":"Love the bagels here! I have a larger chain literally across the street from my neighborhood, but I drive the 2 miles up to this place!"}
{"text":"Hot Bagels is the bomb.com and that's all there is to it. It's a little pricey for a bagel with some cheese and egg on it, but totally worth it. They do a good job for how busy it can get in the morning!"}
{"text":"The Bagels are good and always fresh. The staff is always friendly and know what I want. Love this place."}
{"text":"Love me some Hot Bagels! Double Egg, Double Cheese all the way!  Fresh, amazing bagels and a huge variety too. I haven't had a bad experience here, ever, it always tastes wonderful. The staff are friendly and upbeat; and the price is nice.  I've only ever had breakfast here but they have lunch bagels too which look delish. The only sad part is when they run out of your favourite flavours of bagels...so get there early if you can or suffer the consequences.  My mouth is crying for Hot Bagels...."}
{"text":"This place is really good...everything is fresh and super yummy. They use boar's head cold cuts which are the best quality ever"}
{"text":"Well deserved reputation.  I'm literally copying from someone else's review, regarding the Ham & Egg & Cheese on pumpernickel.  \"Very satisfying. I did think that the bagel was a bit large overall, and lacked that shiny chewy outer crusty situation that great bagels show off. I also thought that the pumpernickel flavor was muted as well.\"  I ordered the extra egg (60 cents) and extra cheese (60 cents). Total was just over 6 bucks. Without the extras the sandwich would be much too thin. As it was, I only ate 25% of the bagel/bread itself with 100% of the hameggcheese. Fine with me, as it was totally filling, hot (true to the restaurant's name) & savory."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior, it's not particularly attractive or appealing but once in, you're caught. The interior is very nice, lots of tile and rock, very beautiful for a simple bagel shop.   The staff is extremely helpful, sweet, and patient. I saw one staff member take his time out of restocking just to hold the door for a customer carrying some items. I rarely see that at other establishments. The ladies behind the counter always greet and help you with a smile! That was nice. :)   Well I ordered a bagel sandwich with coffee and then had a crumb cake afterwards and ordered a brownie to go. Everything is priced decently (especially the sweets). And the food was great (ESPECIALLY the crumb cake!). The sandwiches are large and I could only eat half and had to save the other half for later. The only complaint I have regarding what I ordered was the coffee. It was very cold.  :(  This place is great for breakfast or lunch! And there is seating inside as well as outside!"}
{"text":"Don't think you'll find better in Arizona. Breakfast sandwich on jalapeño bagel is my favorite. I like the bialy's too."}
{"text":"I hate that the bagels are so good because it's always so unpleasant to go there. They are always so rude. Every time I i go  there I leave thinking what an a**hole. Yet, I still go back once in a while because the bagels are good."}
{"text":"Bacon egg on Asiago. Best bagel sandwhich I have ever had. Thank god my wife works next store to this place!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is a daily hot spot! I've visited on at least 5 different days, and every order was made to order correctly. Their house made cream cheeses are STRAIGHT FIRE! Especially the sweeter ones, like their strawberry and blueberry. Fluffy, creamy, accompanied by delicious flavors to choose from. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly happy with this place, although it's not my most favorite breakfast destination for a few reasons.   1. I'd highly recommend giving this place an interior design makeover. The paint job is seriously gross and it makes me not want to go! Sounds silly, but appearance at restaurants are very important.  2. Foam coffee cups? Splurge and get the paper cups atleast. Details make a difference.  3. Don't mix the jalapeño bagels with the blueberry bagels. How does that make sense?   Even though these are small details, they matter and can be fixed easily!   Aside from those small points, they make pretty good sandwhiches!"}
{"text":"1230 on a Sunday and they are sold out of the colorful bagels... I have never been here before but came in to get my daughters a fun colorful bagel. It's 4 and a half hours from when they close today and they just lost business. Also, most of the bagel selection was depleted when I arrived as well."}
{"text":"Okay, I think I may be addicted to this place.  It worries me how often I go here for lunch between classes.  But you know what, I've had the best damn turkey reuben I've ever had here.  I have a problem.  As much as I want to try other things, I just...keep...ordering....it!  That's kind of a lie.  Their breakfast sandwiches are excellent.  As is their philly cheese steak sandwich.  All in all, the prices cannot be beat, the service is friendly and lightening fast, and it's a great alternative to the terrible food at the MWU cafeteria."}
{"text":"I ordered the special: egg, meat, and cheese sandwich with a coffee for $4.50. Not a bad deal, I thought.   My version ordered was ham, cheddar, on a toasted sesame bagel, with the addition of avocado and tomato. My total with the add-ons was just under $7. Ok.   The woman working the front counter seemed distracted from the moment I walked in, so I was not surprised when I received my bacon and American cheese sandwich (with avocado and tomato) on an un-toasted sesame bagel. Huh?   And, not realizing yet that my sandwich was all wrong, when I confirmed that I could grab a coffee on my way out, she said she forgot to ring me up for the drink but I could take it if I wanted. Didn't I just pay almost $7 for the $4.50 special? Regardless, I didn't take the coffee.   All that being said, my definitely-not-what-I-ordered breakfast sandwich was pretty good, and the bagel was undeniably fresh... which probably tipped the scales toward me giving them another try next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome bagels, great prices. Turkey club on a garlic bagel ftw."}
{"text":"I love this place. The bagels are fresh and the sandwiches are made right on the spot and ingredients are always fresh as well. My favorite is the lox. My only complaint is the service. I've had a couple of issues with one of the men working behind the counter.. He snapped at me once when I asked a very basic question, then another time he acted really impatient when I was waiting for my 5 year old to decide what kind of cream cheese he wanted. I mean it was REALLY obvious he didn't feel like he had time to wait. Other than that I love it and will continue to go there cause the food is really yummy"}
{"text":"Nothing but good service, does get very busy. You pay for quality food. I usually get bacon/egg/cheese bagel on a Egg bagel."}
{"text":"Bagel was okay . Went in the afternoon and there weren't much options left. There was one plain and three everythings that looked like they had been beaten with a hammer. Thw guy behind the counter wasn't very friendly. Prices were good. The bathroom was Very gross. And no soap which skeeves me out."}
{"text":"Fair warning - you will become addicted to Hot Bagels. The breakfast special is a great way to start your day. This is how bagels should taste. The lunch meats are all Boar Head and man can those guys put together a great sandwich. Take a few dozen with cream cheese and a few pounds of lox for the office. Very small place with barely a dozen indoor seats supplemented by 4-5 sidewalk tables."}
{"text":"Words cannot say enough how much this place rocks! Staff is ALWAYS friendly and outgoing, love them! The food is always bomb and well worth every penny. I get my coffee from them almost every morning and when I get food, it's always fresh and perfectly done. Thanks guys, keep up the awesome work you do!"}
{"text":"very good bagels obviously made in house.  Family feel, good service.  a bit of tight quarters in the dinning area.    It may become a regular spot for me in the future."}
{"text":"Best bagels and fresh sandwiches from s non- national chain.  Not fancy but good!  Not to miss"}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp, and excited to make it for Hot Bagel! I have come here for literally years, the breakfast is that good. For a hot and fresh made bacon egg and cheese on a jalapeño bagel including a soda or a coffee, all for under 6 bucks, you can't beat it!!! Friendly environment, smiling faces, great prices, and food that you can't beat. Must try if you like a hot breakfast!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Bagels are always super fresh and service is insanely quick! Don't get worried if there's a line, we've never waited more than 5 minutes for our breakfast!  There's nothing like a homemade bagel and cream cheese, all the options are super yummy!  There isn't too many tables for inside dining but there are also some tables outside as well (which usually isn't the best option for summer time)"}
{"text":"Love it! I drive 25 mins to this place because it's so worth it. They have great cold sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food. The one thing I wish they would change is just calling out the order, maybe they should have numbers, or even take names? we all order the same things and sometimes people accidentally take your food. By far the best Bagel shop in AZ!"}
{"text":"Cold, bland bagel with minimal cream cheese.  I realize everyone has different tastes and is entitled to their own opinion, but I am baffled as to why people rave over this restaurant.  Yesterday was my first (and last) visit.  I ordered a toasted garlic bagel with garlic cream cheese and scrambled egg.  What I got was a cold, barely toasted bagel, with a very small amount of cream cheese, topped with a cold, fried egg (not scrambled as ordered).  Apparently, their idea of toasting is 30 seconds in a toaster oven because my boyfriend's 'toasted' bagel was cold and barely toasted as well.  Although the bagel and the cream cheese were supposed to be garlic, the garlic flavor was barely detectable.  I'm not usually critical, I frequently review on Yelp and this is my first negative review."}
{"text":"Yelp, you failed me on this one. I stopped by for a couple bagel sandwiches and all of them were just mediocre. I thought the sandwiches were pretty thick which made it difficult to eat; also i didn't think the ingredients were very fresh; finally, i felt sick after I ate one sandwich and my family did too. Maybe I should have just gotten plain bagels? Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really outstanding little deli and bagel shop.  I've driven past this place hundreds of times, but never thought to come in.  I knew they were a popular breakfast stop, but only today heard that they have lunch options too.  Glad I finally found my way here for lunch on a Friday.  The restaurant is set in a shopping center on the southwest corner of 59th Ave and the 101.  They're surrounded by other restaurants including Panda Express, Subway and Del Taco.  Doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside the display area and menu almost immediately clamor for your attention.  As you might expect they have a wide variety of bagels on hand, but they also have a case full of Boar's Head meats ready for slicing for a sandwich or that you can grab by the pound.  There's also a pastry display case in the middle teasing you with baked goods ranging from croissants to cinnamon rolls.  The place was super busy with a mix of locals and Midwestern University students.    As always I look to get a full spectrum of their menu with a first visit to a new restaurant.  I wanted a sandwich, a bagel, and a dessert and I wanted it all to go.  Solution:  A turkey club sandwich on a toasted bagel with cream cheese with a small bag of chips, a fountain drink and a cinnamon roll.  Total price for all of this was just $10.  And despite the crowd, I got my entire to go order in less than 5 minutes.  Brought it back to the office to eat during work.  The sandwich was fantastic.  They did not hold back on the turkey as my sandwich was loaded with it.  Plenty of bacon, lettuce and tomato too.  The bagel was firm from toasting, but still has a light doughy texture that lets you know it was made fresh that day.  They also did not hold back on the icing for the cinnamon roll as the roll was completely drenched in it.  They heated it up for me so it was still warm and fluffy when I was ready to eat.  Their menu is lengthy so give yourself some time to survey the myriad of options when you come in.  The staff is very friendly and as mentioned earlier, operates at a quick pace.  So even if it's busy like it was for me today, the wait isn't too long.  They also have locations on 67th Ave and Happy Valley Rd and on I-17 and the Carefree Highway.  Not much else to add other than three adjectives:  Quick, cheap, delicious."}
{"text":"Yet another Glendale Wife Fail... In our 9 years together, my husband had never had Hot Bagels until last month... I do not know how such a thing happened but I am happy to say he is a repeat customer already! If you are from this side of town like me, you know this place is a staple, a part of growing up here and it hast changed one bit. And that is a great thing. Same quality ingredients, same great people, place, and menu."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a bagel. They do it right--none of those thin Einstein Bagels will be found here. If you want a thick homemade bagel with homemade cream cheese, this is your place. I love their strawberry cream cheese on an everything bagel."}
{"text":"First time here to swoop up some bagel from a place other then Einstein's. I have never made a better choice in my life, chomping on my huge delicious fluffy bagel right now actually. I've never been so full from one bagel in my life, and cannot believe how one place manages to make a bagel taste so great.  Will be going here 10/10 from now on. Sorry Einstein's!"}
{"text":"Just got a bagel here, it was a little bit more on the dry side and it wasn't that big for $5.50. I think if they made their bagels a little bit more moist and saucy, and a little bit beefier for the price, that would be five stars. But for $10 for two bagels egg and cheese, one without meat, is just a bit much. But it was tasty, and convenient and fast."}
{"text":"My go-to breakfast spot is on my way to work, but location is not the only plus with Hot Bagels. Yes, the bagels are hot and fresh as you'd expect.  But they're also frickin' huge.  Hold one next to any other bagel and you'll see the difference.  Although my wife claims the bagels are too salty, I have always been pleased.  And the family frequently gets a dozen on the weekend. Sweet Kona Blend coffee seals the deal, indeed this place is HOT!"}
{"text":"I feel a little sad to leave a bad review as I have been a recurring customer here in the past but I'm hoping the owners review these sites so they can turn some things around. First off, they actually use good ingredients and everything I've eaten there has tasted good. However, they lack severely in service and customer interaction. None of them speak English very well and the male owner tends to just kind of stare at you until you order and barely talks. When I've asked questions I've received answers of 1 or 2 words that left me feeling uncertain and uncomfortable. Today my wife stopped by and believed she was overcharged for her sandwich but when she asked the employee she only got \"no\" as the employee who was there barely speaks any English; I believe she's family of the owners. Their prices are also rather unclear and if you don't specify otherwise they will automatically add chips and drink to your order.  Next, almost every time I've gone in their coffee and/or iced tea dispensers have been empty (I don't drink soda). I always mention it to them but it usually takes them a good 20 minutes to get to it which means I'm done eating before I can fill my cup.  The last item that has always annoyed me is that their TV is always on political channels on rather high volume which, for me, damages the relaxation aspect of eating.  C'mon, Ben's owners! There's a reason the shop is attracting fewer and fewer customers! Give us reasons to be loyal again!"}
{"text":"There is a sign in the window that says a lunch special is a sandwich for $5.99 or $6.99 which includes a drink and a bag of chips. However, when I ordered a tuna sandwich on wheat that's all I got for $8. Not even a pickle spear! I was in a hurry and didn't have time to check on why I didn't get the special. I feel like it's good customer service to educate and honor lunch specials (maybe the tuna sandwich didn't qualify).  The place was not busy when I was there and the employee was cleaning the floors. She wasn't overly friendly, but was fast.  It has been a while since I was here for breakfast, but what I remember is that it was good.  With other sandwich places nearby, I would choose them over this place. However, it is a convenient location and right next to Starbucks for a quick snack if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! We have been loyal customers for years who just went in to buy bagels for the family (extensive family) on Christmas Eve. They made EVERY SINGLE bagel wrong. Once we got home and discovered this, we drove back to get it fixed. The ladies behind the counter had a terrible attitude and argued with us... then proceeded to charge us extra for more lox! The owner of the store was sitting right there and did not even look up from his phone. TERRIBLE. Makes me sad because we loved this place until now."}
{"text":"Bagel and egg were cold. After waiting 20 minutes I would at least expect hot food. Poor service"}
{"text":"Not bad, handles the morning cravings for real style bagels compared to the Starbucks/DD variety.  Usually get the Bagel, egg, and cheese which is around $4 on any of their many vareities of bagels.  Friendly staff, but can get really crowded and busy during peak hours.  Not a perfect 5 star rating because the bagels are not as soft as they can be like NY style.  Many times I've gotten a bagel that is pretty tough, chewy, and hard.  If they can fix that this would get 5 stars"}
{"text":"Always fresh, friendly and fantastic!!  Even when they are super busy with the crowd out the door they are happy to see you. Welcome you like family and make sure you are served with a smile."}
{"text":"The bagels here are large and delicious.  The service is super quick and awesome.  Pricing is great too!"}
{"text":"First of all, if you think a bagel is a piece of bread with a hole in the middle, like grocery stores or chain bagel shops here in AZ sell, then you may not like this place. BUT, if you've ever had a bagel from NY or NJ and wonder why they are almost non-existent anywhere else, this is the place for you. I grew up in Fair Lawn NJ, home of the best bagels on earth. I'm not sure if I would be able to tell the difference between a bagel from this place and one from back home if I was given the blindfold test. And the best thing about it? THEY HAVE TAYLOR HAM!!!! You can get a Taylor ham, egg and cheese on a bagel for breakfast!  PS Real bagels are supposed to give your jaws a workout."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 4 years and it has always been consistant. They do a good job of recognizing their regulars. Sometimes my sandwich is ready by time I get to the register to pay. On top of that the bagel sandwiches are second to none. Hands down the best, I love this place. Do yourself a favor and stop in for a hearty sandwich and soda for under $5."}
{"text":"I think hot bagels are good but not great. There bagels are New York City style, lots of options. The bagel sandwiches are 70% bagel and 30% meat and eggs. But mainly I always feel like I'm rushed out of this place, like their goal is to get you out as quickly as possible. They could use some work on their customer service as I don't get the warm inviting feeling when I go in."}
{"text":"Best bagel shop in town.  A New York style bagel shop with great coffee.  Family owned shop with Boar's Head cold cuts and lots of choices. They can also grill. My daughter's favorite is a toasted bagel with cream cheese, lox and capers. Indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This place is really good for all your bagel desires. They have almost every sort of bagel you can think of, garilic, onion, everything, sesame, peanut butter and even an egg and spinach bagel. I've had their breakfast special \"bagel sandwhich + drink\" countless times which is an excellent deal and I've also had the lox here which is great. They also have a small deli that offers a small selection of Boar's Head cut meats.   The space is small and they close at 4pm though so if you want bagels for the next day come here during lunch when they also offer burgers and chips."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but I have two complaints, each resulting in loss of a star. First, and most importantly, when I order a bagel w/lox, it is fairly gross to have strawberry cream cheese smeared on it from the bagel they cut prior to mine. Either have a separate knife for sweet and savory, or wipe the knife. Second, the amount of cream cheese varies dramatically, sometimes it is overflowing, sometimes barely enough to cover bagel.   That being said, they make great bagels, have a great selection of cream cheese and have very fast service."}
{"text":"Living in NYC has definitely spoiled me so I came here with no expectations for the bagels and I'm glad I did. To start, egg and lox? I'm sure we asked for a lox with cream cheese and the works. NOT egg and lox. We also got an egg and cheese on an everything which barely had any egg or cheese! How this place has such great reviews...i'll never know since I won't be back."}
{"text":"This really is the best place as well as 59th to get fresh bagels and lox... I really hope the owners read this because both places are not kept clean in your eating area. The small garbage can is always over full and all of the seats and tables need to wiped down by you  , not your customers..  Anyone look at the floor recently and NOT at the end of the day.. ? Service. Great Kona coffee Rocks..   I like to eat in and people watch but sitting in a mess is not worth it. I noticed that some other customers also remarked about this in both stores..."}
{"text":"I love these bagels but am tired of not getting what we ordered. Again today we ordered a couple of everything bagels and get home only to find the wrong flavor in the bag.  Now what we got was tasty but when your are expecting a certain flavor it is disappointing to not get what you ordered. From now on we will check before we leave the store.  On another issue the cashier just stood there this morning stretching her hands and completely ignoring my husband as he stood there to place our order until he said something to her....rude.  Remember folks that many a business have gone under based only on their poor customer service. You have a great product now provide great customer service as well and you will have it made."}
{"text":"Had a really great blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese!  Saw the reviews and was a little nervous but mine was perfect!"}
{"text":"I come here maybe once or twice a week. There bagels are amazing and so are the breakfast potatoes. The owners are very kind and work fast. There food is delicious and very affordable, it's well put together, cute little breakfast place. Me and my significant other love it that much"}
{"text":"Long time customer and my time here has come to an end... Like other recent reviewers, the quality has gone down hill recently. I normally stop in before a ride to Sedona because they are on the way... I heard there is new ownership so maybe they didn't all the recipes from the old owner?!?  I can only recommend getting a bagel there - skip the sandwiches, the 3 that I ordered were terrible (who puts onions on a club sandwich?)  I wish I got the bagel my friend got with plain cream cheese.  What happened guys?!?"}
{"text":"My brother and I love this spot. Great place for some nice breakfast for a busy day! It's usually pretty consistent here, the owners are so awesome and recognize us, can't tell if it's a good thing (we are here often! :-)). I always get the #2 breakfast platter with my eggs over easy. So yummy! Seeing some sad reviews, sucks that happened! It's Never been a problem for us. We love it and bring all of our favorite people here!"}
{"text":"The bagels here practically melt in your mouth when your eating them because of how fresh they are. This is my second time coming here and I opted for the bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel. The last time I was here , I got the Taylor ham, egg, and cheese and it was delish! I will say they could've been a little more generous with the amount of egg and bacon they put on it. Especially for a $5.00 breakfast sandwich. I was able to overlook that because of how delicious the bagel was (and I was starving) I would rate my first experience 5 stars and this one 3.5. Hopefully next time it will be better."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! The bagels are so fresh and delicious, and even though it's super busy on weekends, you're in and out pretty quick!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Without ever being to NYC, this is THE best bagel I have ever had! Small, family run bagel shop serving breakfast and lunch. They have boars head meats, fresh made bagels daily, great fast service and amazing bagels! I had a sesame bagel with egg (fresh cracked egg) provolone, bacon and tomato with cream cheese on the side. Hits the spot!! If you live in the area this a must go to breakfast and lunch place! Monday through Friday from 5:30am to 11am for $5.25 you can get a breakfast bagel sandwich and coffee/drink! When I lived here I came here often and was anxious to return to have another bagel sandwich!! Great little patio to sit at and have coffee with a small view of the mountain. Can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! Can't really eat inside because it's always jam packed, but that's got to mean they're doing something right. I always call ahead and do a pickup at least once a week. Their breakfast bagels are delicious, and always fresh."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least 50 times and love the food and cleanliness of the establishment.  Came in and ordered a bagel and a drink and went to look at my receipt to see I was charged for two bagels. I only ordered them one and the person in front of me ordered the two bagels. I asked to change it and The Cashier was incredibly rude and acted like it was my fault because she put the order in wrong.  I'm sorry I don't want to pay for two times the food and that you put the order of the  person in front of me in for mine. I couldn't believe it. I've spent a lot of money here won't be back if that's how I was treated for your mistake"}
{"text":"The food here is decent. However,  the service  is so bad that I wouldn't consider ever going here again. The owner who was running the register definitely didn't make anyone feel welcome. (Not even a \"Hello\"?) Well, that and the fact that we ordered coffee and from the time we arrived until we left (nearly 40 minutes), all six containers of coffee were empty. The place was still busy. Surprise folks support small businesses in spite of how bad the customer service might be."}
{"text":"Very good bagels & quick! I only have them a 3 out of 5 because they have screwed up my (simple) order several times & then acted extremely rude about it."}
{"text":"Pleasant service and decent food. Better than expected. I'd definitely come back here for a breakfast bagel or burrito. No children selections though."}
{"text":"Tried this place 3 times hoping it'd be better but no luck Bagels taste stale not fresh as they claim to be. Bagels are overloaded with cream cheese and not toasted when specifically asked. We need an Einstein Bagels in North Phoenix 100 times better!"}
{"text":"I had to just pick the first sandwich,  California,  and put it on a bagel. Will definitely be back because a ton of things look good.  The California was great, and I added lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Watched a ton of people grab Starbucks next door,  but why bother.  Coffee was included with the sandwich and it was just fine. Good find!"}
{"text":"Hot bagelz is the best!!!! I love everything here their bagels are so yummy  I love their schmears and their boars head sandwiches"}
{"text":"Ok I have been here a number of times. It is the best bagels I have ever had. It does not matter what you get here it is good. The best thing it has going for it is Starbucks next door.  The bagels are great any time of the day. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The best bagels in the valley. I love the breakfast sandwich and the blueberry bagel. They're usually busy but you never have to wait more then 5-10 minutes if that to get your food. The staff are friendly, and the coffee is pretty great too. I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Very friendly, very fast service, delicious bagels, all around great delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Opinion.. finely dice your Jalepenos in your cream cheese, too big of slices and it wasnt spicy."}
{"text":"This place has awesome bagels and quick service. It is my favorite spot for a quick breakfast. I would definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. There always nice and super quick. The food is always good and decently priced."}
{"text":"Went in one time. Bagels are way too salty!! Literally made me sick to my stomach. Never again!"}
{"text":"If you're craving for bagels or breakfast, you need to go here and eat every / any bagel you can think of."}
{"text":"I love coming here.  Quick service along with quality ingredients.  All of this close to home?  Sounds like a winner to me!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I love this place. Service is friendly, food is great... a little on the small side but that's because it's always packed!"}
{"text":"I stopped in earlier this week just to try a bagel and my verdict is it was good and so far was the closest to a good bagel that I've tried so far. The biggest difference really was the size these bagels here are double the size of others I've had . My first bagel here was the asiago . The asiago was a plain bagel baked with asiago cheese on the top that melts threw the middle and settles on the bottom .   The Bagel was good and would be four stars for just bagels and cream cheese  and lox .   Yesterday a group of us went for sandwiches , two people had the Italian Hero's , one person had Liverwurst ( yes she did ! and she was thrilled to eat it ((not for me)) and I had pastrami on rye . The pastrami is boars head brand sliced thin so you know what that taste like it's not like a fresh cooked pastrami to me but it's ok and the rye bread is your typical Arizona rye that doesn't taste or have the texture of fresh baked rye bread from a bakery . Don't take what I said the wrong way , I am not saying anything was wrong with this sandwich , it was OK . I purchased a bagel and lox for latter , it is Adam Richman SLIDER SIZED it wickedly large , even if I only eat half I am not sure I can open my mouth big enough to eat it . (see photo)   I just ate half of the lox and cream cheese sesame bagel,Gosh! it was good and wasn't in the same category as the pastrami sandwich , This place is truly between a 3 and a 4...... The bagels should be smaller so you can enjoy a whole sandwich as a bagel .  BUT, You might need to examine your Italian hero if you buy one because the casing wasn't removed on the pepperoni in the sandwich and had to be removed before eating .  Besides BIG BAGELS and a million different cream cheeses they make , breakfast , cold & hot sandwiches , Wraps , and they sell deli items buy the pound . This business is a great addition to this part of town even with the Arrowhead location only a few miles away .  as a slight update,1-2-12 I went back and purchased  an assortment of bagels some were very dense and not made correctly so I had to throw them out because you couldn't eat them. When you look at the case if you see smaller bagels they are most likely going to be very dense."}
{"text":"Best bagels in the valley, bar none. If you're looking for a New York bagel, this is as close as you're gonna get for about a thousand miles. I'm just glad they're this close to the house...."}
{"text":"Bagels!  NOT round bread with a hole in it. From the East coast, Tri-State area, I know bagels and these guys have them. Boars head cold cuts to go with it. Simple place, but that's all a good bagel joint needs. Kinda hard to find, but worth the effort."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of favorable reviews on here for this place but I can't understand why...lol...this place is near me so we decided to try it out...we had been disappointed to Manny Times going to Einstein's so we were looking for some place New...What a mistake this place was, in my opinion it makes Einstein's look like a gourmet baggle restaurant.  Couldn't have been more disappointed...the bagles were terrible and the coffee wasn't any better.  Were not picky we just wasn't decent food and good service for our money that's not too much to ask for.  One more thing the strawberry cream cheese taste like it was poorly mixed with regular cream cheese and some nasty strawberry flavoring...yuk...also it's tiny and dirty. I can usually go by reviews on here but the ratings for this place were way off base."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The bagels are made in house.  They are amazing!  The asiago is heavenly.  They use Boars Head meats too.  They are not shy with the meat when they craft your sandwich.  I usually eat half for lunch and the rest later.  It is quite filling and yummy.  They even have a bagel dog that is fabulous.  Breakfast sandwiches rock.  My children love this place as well.  The staff is very friendly and always happy to see you.  It doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"I really like their breakfasts here! It's down the street from my university, yet I didn't find out about this place until recently. My friend asked if I wanted \"hot bagels\" and my response was that I love hot bagels more than cold ones. Little did I know that this little joint that seats only about 15 people inside and maybe 5 more outside got such great business and had such yummy food!  I've been here about 4 times now, and I usually get the breakfast sandwich special that comes with a bagel sandwich (my choice of bagel, cheese, egg, and meat) along with a drink (fountain, coffee, or OJ) for only $3! It's a great deal for when I want to eat on a budget. I've had a blueberry bagel w blueberry cream cheese, wheat bagel and onion bagel sandwiches. They also serve boar's head deli meat. Yummy! =)"}
{"text":"Extremely clean inside which is a great first impression. Also, this place is constantly packed on the weekends from the couple of times that I've gone in with a line starting at the entrance.   Bagels are super good! Huge selection to chose from and they are quick to take your order and deliver it.   The GF wanted me to incorporate a review about the iced tea to which she was super disappointed with as it was flat and not tasteful (referring to the iced tea that is brewing there)."}
{"text":"These bagels are absolutely amazing! I have been going here for years and will never go to another bagel shop again. They are fresh and made with fresh ingredients and taste oh so good! My favorite bagel is their garlic bagel toasted with cream cheese. Sooo yummy!! If I'm really hungry I will get a garlic bagel toasted with bacon egg and cheese. I absolutely love this place. The only bad thing about it is over the years people have found out about it so it's always packed. Even if the line is to the door though, the most I've waited to place my order was maybe 5 minutes and maybe another 5 minutes waiting to get my bagel. They are truly an amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Great bagel sandwiches! Good service and a great place for an authentic east coast bagel."}
{"text":"So yesterday morning I went to breakfast with my best friend and it was pretty delicious. To be honest, I didn't really feel welcome or like the owners or who ever was serving us was as friendly as they could've been. If you can get past the not as friendly service, then I do recommend this place. I had a chocolate chip bagel with butter and plain cream cheese. I definitely want to try a burrito or breakfast sandwich of some sort. It's very cute and cozy on the inside as well. If you've never been, I would say at least try it. If that service was absolutely terrible, then I might say different. But it wasn't unbearable. I was also really excited to try this place because my parents had told me about it. I think the owners are from Paris or Italy or something."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE breakfast place! Reminds me of my local bagel shop I went to when I lived in Virginia! Definitely recommend! Great service, yummy food!"}
{"text":"This place is amyazong! Best breakfast I've ever had! My go-to place anytime I'm heading up north for breakfast before the road trip - which brings me to my only complaint: WHY THE HELL AREN'T THERE ANY OF THESE PLACES IN CENTRAL PHOENIX?! Three locations all up on the edge of BFE? Come on now. Please. Come on down to central Phoenix. Share the awesome with everyone."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS packed and they seem to cycle through the orders VERY fast! Very tasty bagels and breakfast burritos. Home cooked taste to the breakfast platters. HUGE variety of drinks.  100% recommended."}
{"text":"I went here cause they have some seriously amazing brownies. Like, I'll mug a senior citizen if I knew they were carrying one of the brownies from Hot Bagels.... Anyway, I decided to go for their buffalo chicken sandwich on a plain bagel. Not too bad. I mean, it's kinda hard to mess up a deli sandwich, am I right? They have a lot of choices and the price is right too. $5.95 for a cold sandwich ($6.95 for a hot) which includes chips and a drink. Yeah, move over Subway...lol My friend and I also tried their bagel dog...that's really yummy too. I'll be back to try other things along with buying out their supply of brownies.  Oh, and the reason why I only gave 4/5 stars is because it was kinda loud in there and had to have the girl who was taking my order repeat herself at least 3 times. It's wasn't cause of loud music or anything, it's just cause there was a lot of people dining in and the seating area, although good enough, is still kinda on the small side. I think I may have seen a table or two outside too but they were empty as its was hotter than the surface of the sun outside...lol."}
{"text":"Found out about this place at the bridge reopening party. They had a table and i couldn't stop going back and enjoying these amazing bagels they had out. The young lady at the table was explaining how they do theirs and i could taste the difference from what i normally get. If you want the best bagels in Surprise this is the place to go. I loved the rye bagel and cream cheese it is awesome."}
{"text":"Can't believe that I have not tried this place yet...right around the corner from my house! What a little gem.  Food was great (we had breakfast) - great selection of bagels (all were fresh). I would and will be going back. This is my new quick stop place! They are FAST at filling orders too.... so no wait time! And, as others have mentioned --- the bagels are HUGE!  LOST STAR - the sitting area was not \"clean\". I had to clean my own table. This is hot button for me. I expect to be able to come in, order, and sit down at a clean table. The place was not that busy - so they just need to come out and clean every once in a while."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick bagel and was very happy with what we got!! The staff was very friendly,  the bagels are huge with plenty of cream cheese. Excellent! !"}
{"text":"This is the greatest bagel shop. Breakfast sandwiches are awesome. If you are there at lunch try a reuben, you will thank me later. Great staff. Love it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at other Hot Bagel locations and have had a good experience. I would rate these experiences a solid 4 stars. However, yesterday I was served one of the saltiest meals I have ever eaten. I was even drunk at the time and it still tasted like crap. I got the Taylor Ham w/ egg and cheese. My friend said his sandwich was also very salty.  Plus, the ham was very thin which was disappointing to me. Yes, I understand that Taylor Ham is expensive, but you can just shave off a few small pieces and call it good!  I hate to say it, but Denny's can make a better sandwich than the one I had yesterday."}
{"text":"You know that old saying that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach? Well, what the originator of that quote was really trying to say is that the way to a man's heart is through Hot Bagels.   I've been going to this place for years; therefore, I always took the fantastic assortment of bagels, cream cheeses as well as the extremely low prices for granted. I knew Hot Bagels was the best place to get a fast and cheap breakfast, and I wanted to spread the word.   So I offered to bring my romantic companion breakfast one morning; his honed taste buds reawakened me to the rare deliciousness that is Hot Bagels. On a side note, I'm pretty sure the bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich sealed the deal.   If you are planning on winning over a romantic companion with food, use Hot Bagels. Might I suggest: lox spread on a sesame seed bagel, salmon on a salt bagel, or the breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel. Your love-life will flourish, guaranteed!"}
{"text":"MEH...  Love it or leave it.  Hit or miss.  Bagels are adequate, but the customer service is so uneven, often-times I wonder why I stop.  There seems to be a communication problem between the person taking your order and the customer.   I admit, I like my bagel done in a specific way: Poppy-seed, Toasted, scooped, easy on the low fat cream cheeses spread and cut all the way through...and I ask for it that way every single time.  No kidding, I've NEVER received my bagel done exactly the way I ask. Always, something is done wrong, or left out...not scooped, or not toasted, or not cut through...etc.  If I were you and you had another place to go for a morning bagel, I'd drive by this place."}
{"text":"Found this gem through the recommendation of a friend. This family owned place is tucked in into a little strip mall, don't pass it up! They serve breakfast and lunch with all sorts of bagels and sandwiches- can always find something to please everyone. My personal favorite is the egg, cheese, and sausage on a croissant. If you're up in the neighborhood or own your way up north, definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"I'm giving them five stars bc their lox everything bagel sandwich is amazing, it's all I get!! It is stacked with lox, capers, onion, and tomato and of course, a generous slathering of cream cheese. Did I mention, it is huge!!?? Also, 8 bucks... but plenty for two people. I mean plenty!! My husband and I share it every time with a cup of coffee and it hits the spot! The bagels are an excellent quality, chewy yet soft in the center, a lot like a good NY bagel.   Sure, on a Saturday morning this place is gang busters....if the line isn't out the door, it almost is. The service though is always fast, so I don't mind. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were so happy when this location opened.  Awesome breakfast sandwiches and fantastic lunches.  Bagels are as good as east coast bagels."}
{"text":"Sitting was very small. There is only one table for a party that is larger than 4 people. I ordered a toasted bagel but the bagel came out more trouble than toasty and all areas. I always go high on reviewing a bagel place because I'm from New York City and hope to be met with that quality when I order them. I was disappointed in this particular place as I could have gotten to the bagels with lox and cream cheese spread at the supermarket. It's OK for the area and I'm sure they have other nice things on the menu but the name of the business is hot bagels so that's what I expect to be the best thing on the menu and it wasn't."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite breakfast place of all time. Simple, cheap, and delicious!  Grew up riding my bike here every Saturday morning with my brothers. One of the best places in Glendale.  Their service and food is quick, but they comprise customer service. They are not rude, but they are just very focused on pumping out orders- they do not care about going above and beyond for customers.  Regardless of their service, the bagels are amazing and is always a great breakfast meeting place or great for to-go food. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Dropped by Hot Bagels and Deli on a Saturday morning to grab a few bagels for the week. Be warned! This place can get super packed on a weekend warning, as expected. The line does tend to move quickly though! I grabbed half a dozen of the everything bagels and was pleasantly surprised by how good they were! Just the right amount of breadiness and definitely not too chewy. My only complaint would be that the bagels were a tad bit salty, considering that they do seem to add additional salt onto the top of the bagel with their everything bagel seasoning. Overall, a great place to grab bagels if you're in the area."}
{"text":"OMFG BAGELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK look they are not the best bagel shop in the world that title belongs only to 'My Favorite Muffin' in Utica NY. This place sells real bagels.. that's why they get 5 stars. Actual bagels.. perhaps you don't understand what i mean. There is one single acceptable method for making a bagel and they employ that method. I have been with out a proper bagel for several years while living in CA, OR and WA. I live in North Scottsdale and I drive out there often."}
{"text":"When a Jewish immigrant from Eastern Europe recommends a bagel joint you have to listen!!  Great bagels...great sandwiches using Old Boars Head products!!  Best of all these people are nice and LOVE their customers....I have never felt anything but appreciation from these fine fine folks."}
{"text":"Awesome. I had been going to Einstein's bagels for as long as I can remember. I will never go back there again after trying this place. The yelp reviews don't lie. These bagels are huge. I'm pretty sure they even make their own cream cheese. You have not lives until you have eaten here. Defiantly recommend to anyone in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.. My husband and I had dined in 4 times. Each time we got the same thing but the total was always more then the last time we visited. We just thought the prices increased  and they didn't update the sign above until today.. Today I ordered my usual 2 bagels and \"home\" fries and they CHARGED ME 3 THOUSAND DOLLARS.. When the woman behind the counter told me my card was declined I quickly checked my account.. When I noticed the charge I was shocked and told her to reverse it.. Errors happen but it should have been 14$ and she charged 3,311.00$  she got irate wth me and said she didn't do the card wrong. I showed her my bank app with the proof and she told me to come back tomrrow to talk to the manager. I became so upset and told her she needed to get her manager down here now and have him fix it. That I wasn't leaving without the money refunded or reversed. She started arguing with me so I decided to call the police best to have them demand her manager.  I wasn't leaving seeing how the cater and I didn't need them lieing and saying I ordered 6,000 bagels or something. When the manger showed up she was even ruder. She (the manager) told me she reversed it and that j shouldn't have yelled at her employee. The cop standing behind me looked at her and said, lady if you took that much money from me I would have yelled too, she was in shock..  This is not how you handle business. If she doesn't know how to use the undo button on a credit card machine she shouldn't be left alone.. The charge was reversed but I will NEVER be coming back here."}
{"text":"There is a Starbucks right next door, so whenever I grab a coffee I'll usually stop in here for a bite to eat. (great decision for a location.) I usually grab a lox bagel and its always nice. It has the usual; smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, and onions. Never a complaint....although to give a full review I probably should try something else too :)"}
{"text":"I only give it 4 stars because it closes so early and when it is open it is super busy and sometimes I don't get the type of bagel I want. But other than that, this place is amazing. And the best hang over food. I love the lox bagel and the bacon egg and cheese bagel. You know what? Anything here is delicious. The people that work here are so nice."}
{"text":"Amazing bagels, especially the Asiago and Egg bagel! You have to get there early or they will be out! Love their bagel sandwiches too! Btw people, if you think they are being rude please don't ever go to Philly or New York. You will never survive. Its a different culture over there and that's why the people at Hot Bagels come across as rude when they really aren't. Not much else to say but go in and try a bagel!"}
{"text":"Wow how times have changed, the level of service and the attitude of the staff make this a location I'm not coming back to. I'm going to stay at the original, the one on 5th and Beardsley where the customer matters"}
{"text":"ROLF ~ I hate to give any business a 1 star rating especially when it's a locally owned but after two different visits to Hot Bagels & Deli in Surprise, I view them as a potential health hazard.    Our last visited started off on the wrong foot with the owners having a conversation between themselves and ignoring their customers.  We ordered two bagel sandwiches for lunch ~ asiago cheese bagel with ham & cheese and a side of chips and drink.  They only offered two choices of cheese, Swiss and American which I don't like either... My friend ordered a turkey & swiss (only choice) on a jalapeno bagel.    Half way through our bagel sandwiches I noticed little blue dots on bottom of his bagel and they were not jalapeno's, ROLF!  The bagels were old, chewy and came with a bit if penicillin apparently.  This was my second bad visit and don't plan to go back.  I tried to tell the owners about our experience and she turned away and walked off! wowsers!"}
{"text":"FINALLY a decent place for breakfast and lunch in this area!!!  Whoopee!    This Hot Bagels & Deli is very similar to the HB&D at 59th and the 101Hwy and the one up at Carefree and I17Hwy.  Same great menu and the same set up.  The only bad thing about this location is they are in the most hidden area of the Walmart Neighborhood Market strip center so unless you see their sign or search for them on Yelp, you may bot notice them.  Service~ they are new, still ironing out some kinks but all in all it was good service.   Food~ Some of the best bagels you'll find in and around Phoenix metro. We had an issue with their pumpernickel bagels missing some of the \"pumper\" in the nickel (meaning it was too light and did not have that solid~dark brown pumpernickel taste).  It was very good though especially with a fried egg and sausage!  Their lox and slice nova is very good and so is their coffee.  They use a Kona blend that taste more like Kona than most other blends.  They use only Boars Head products and they make their bagels fresh onsite.  I look forward to seeing this new small business grow and become as popular as the other HB&D's I mentioned.  I am SO GLAD to see them open in this area that is struggling with a decent place to eat breakfast!!  I hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is awful!  Cashier messed up my order Then server and her argued with me about it. Then cashier talked smack about me with me looking at her!    Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I'm so glad they opened up in the neighborhood!  Before that, I used to drive down to their 59th Ave & Behrend Dr location (also great) for my bagel fix.  The bagels here are huge, delicious, and very reasonably priced.  IMO, best in the Valley.  My husband and I are fans of the breakfast sandwich combo (choice of bagel, breakfast meat, egg & cheese, with coffee or a soda.)  I love mine with Taylor ham, egg, and cheese.  So good.  Also great getting a bagel and cream cheese.  My sons love the frosted cinnamon rolls.  I keep meaning to try the other sandwich offerings on the menu, but every time I walk in I just end up ordering bagels.  :)  Highly recommended!  I hope this place stays around for a long, long time."}
{"text":"Good bagels and super generous with the cream cheese.  My kids love the warm cinnamon rolls with frosting.  Never had any rude service that some other reviewers mentioned.  Missing the fifth star because there's no restroom and also because it's pretty tiny...there's hardly space to stand while you're waiting for your food, and at busy times you're lucky if you can get a seat."}
{"text":"I was in the area and a quick Yelp search led me here. I arrived around 10:30am on Sunday, they were really busy. Line moved fairly quick but as a first time visitor, it wasn't that friendly as I couldn't read that small fonts on the menu on the wall until I got close to ordering. Didn't get a chance to study the menu, I ordered what came to my eyes quick.  I was excited to see Kona coffee but ended with disappointment. That coffee was so weak, it wasn't even a coffee.   Price was very reasonable. My order of gyro came with chips and drink, not sure how much was each but I paid $28 total for four meals after tax and tips. So each was about 5-6?  My gyro was good, nice flavor of meat, I enjoyed my early lunch."}
{"text":"Food: The best bagels in town!!! My absolute favorite location for a nice quick breakfast on-the-go. They have all kinds of bagels here: sesame, onion, garlic, salt, jalapeno, pumpernickle, chocolate chip, spinach, everything, and so much more. I love the garlic bagel that has granulated garlic sprinkled on the outside, giving it a nice crunch with every bite. Toast that bagel up, and it's just perfect. My boyfriend loves his bagel with sausage, bacon, egg, and cheese. I would personally recommend getting a bagel with Taylor ham, simply mouth-watering and fulfilling. They have a breakfast special Mon-Fri 5:30-11am that is $5.25 for any bagel with meat, egg, & cheese along with coffee/soda. If you are not into bagels, have no fear. They offer sandwiches here that I have not tried yet, but heard through the grapevine that are equally awesome.   Location: This bagel shop is situated in the same plaza as Panda Express, Papa Murphy's, Subway, and other businesses. It's right across from Midwestern University, so there is a fair share of students grabbing breakfast and lunch. There is a private parking lot that is shared with other stores around it. Plenty of parking everywhere, so parking is not an issue. They have seatings available inside and outside for those wanting to dine in.   Service: It might get busy here, but the workers are trained to work at a very fast and efficient speed. The turnaround time between ordering and picking-up is short, less than ~ 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I confused this as part of anither chain with a very similar name. The comparison doesn't even stand. The guy behind the counter looked miserable and was not friendly at all. The sandwich was OK, but I prefer Taylor ham over regular ham. The menu is quite small."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I get the Taylor ham, egg, and cheese on an Asiago bagel (toasted) and it is to die for. My mom ordered the chorizo burritos and it came with salsa and sour cream. It was incredible. The people are super nice and the food is cooked very fast."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a little morning breakfast or snack!  The people behind the counter seem no nonsense and are very fast and efficient.  The food is great and I recommend the everything bagel with lox.  Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here and they were rude and charged different prices then on the menu and they told us it was because we ordered something off menu but we asked for what was on there. be aware dining here."}
{"text":"The best bagel we have found in Phoenix area. They are made the proper way. Let them raise and boil to great that nice chewy crust on the out side.  Have many kinds but still plain is the way to eat a real bagel. I am boots fan of Boars-head meets so just buy the bagels. We buy a couple dozen at a time and freeze as we live in Surprise You can not go wrong to make the trip to Glendale if you like a good chew outside and nice softer inside as a bagel should be.  Do not miss this bagel shop"}
{"text":"This is better than store bought bagels!  They have raised the prices and that's not helping.  The food is good and even when busy they do get things done.  This would be a better place if they stopped hiring kids and hired adults!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile coming here since I don't work in this area much. The bagel and cream cheese seemed to have lost that flavor that always brought me in. And since I do not like the breakfast sandwiches or burritos (the bacon is gross) there. I have no reason to comeback. I agree with everyone else on the guy's crappy attitude, I guess I always overlooked it to the yummy bagel end goal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and was PACKED!!!Fast service and the BEST breakfast sandwich of my life! This place is a winner!My only complaint is that the breakfast sandwich was a little wimpy (small portions) but you can add an extra egg to your sandwich to give it more substance. That and there wasn't anywhere clean to eat. Those are my only complaints other than that this place is great!"}
{"text":"The best. I promise you'll keep coming back. I love the Reuben with an everything bagel. Hot is the best way."}
{"text":"Straight from the north east.  This is an authentic bagel.  Just as good as we bought from them back in Fair Lawn New Jersey.  They were even open on Christmas Day.  Now for Chinese food....."}
{"text":"Can you believe this place is right next to a Subway and people still go to Subway?! My first time here and I get a gorgeous sandwich plus chips and a drink for cheaper then Subway. The food is so good. The establishment clean and well kept. Plus, no employee is just hanging around looking bored and all of them seem happy to be here. Five stars indeed! No more Subway for me!"}
{"text":"Wow, they are fast on Sunday morning.  They could move the tables around to create more space."}
{"text":"Gets busy and seats go super fast.  Excellent b-fast sammies on fantastic bagels!"}
{"text":"Bagel, French Roast Coffee 3x a week!"}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I've been here but these are real deal New York style bagels complete with boar's head meats. I love the everything bagel with garlic cream cheese. Sometimes I go for a double toast because I like them a little extra crispy. Probably goes against NY bagel rules. Lately (after my New Yorker friend visited) I've been going for my usual and adding tomato, onion, and caper. Super stinky breath and totally worth it.   I've tried all types of bagels ma flavors of cream cheeses and they are bomb. If you go for lunch, I recommend the hot turkey sandwich. Melt I. Your mouth deliciousness.   All reasonably priced and they brew China mist tea. A couple of west valley locations make this place a must. I'm pretty sure they are open on all holidays too."}
{"text":"Hand crafted NY style bagels, a variety of sandwiches, both breakfast and lunch, a great reuben, all make for a must check out place. On my first visit, I noticed that there were quite a few folks dining in. A friendly staff and a wide variety of bagels, schmears and other toppings made the place quite appealing. My wife had the reuben while I tried the ham, cheeses and egg on jalapeno bagels. Both were great ! We ended up also buying the bakers dozen of bagels. As good as any bagels I've ever had. Worth the trip to go visit and order ip a great bagel. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Hot Bagels some of the best bagels I have ever had. They have speedy service. I go there at least once a week for breakfast, and its affordable to do that (and I work for minimum wage). Their breakfast menu is delicious, but their lunch menu is also great. I think people forget about their lunch food, but its still just as great. I recommend it for everyone."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to get a bagel and cream cheese or a breakfast bagel sandwich. Both my wife and I got the bacon, egg and cheese bagel and added cream cheese. We have had the bagel sandwiches before but adding cream cheese really helped enhance the sandwich. I was so hungry that I forgot to take pictures though! I have had their bagels and cream cheese in the past as well and the very good as well. They make their bagels New York style so they taste different (in a good way) that what you will find at Einstein's or other bagel places. If you are looking for a good breakfast spot that is quick and filling, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for breakfast. I get their bagel sandwich and it is to die for. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I last stopped here years ago right after they opened. At the time I wondered how well they would do next to a Starbucks and opening what I considered late on the morning for folks getting to work. Well they are still here and still disorganized. I like all the cream cheese options. With only 2 orders in the works it seemed quite a while to toast a bagel for 3 workers. I did notice they were still making fresh bagels in small batches as they were going. If speed is of the essence I see they have a national chain competitor now in the same center. The owner appears almost rude with customers but l think that comes from the environment he came from."}
{"text":"One day I was looking to eat out for once for breakfast and checked out Paradise Bakery. The line felt like it was going to be an hour wait. We go to IHOP and it's a two hour wait! Finally we found Hot Bagels & Deli. Now if you're looking for a nice sitdown place with a waiter this isn't the place for you. The service was just adequate that's why I gave it a three but otherwise the food was delicious and there was no wait like at all those other places. Plus the prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Excellent Reuban sandwich, my lunch date had a.pastrami, was also good. For the money, its a very good value. Reuban was 6.95 and it included.chips and a.drink. what I don't like about the.place, when not busy staff seemed to be just standing around, normally this might be okay, but the  the deli floor was ridiculously dirty, someone could have been cleaning it up. other small think, staff talking crap about customers when they were leaving. Not cool. Otherwise,  good.place."}
{"text":"Price increase this week to $7.25 per sandwich and now DOES NOT include chips and a drink ...that's $0.75 extra. It used to seem worth the trip...no it's robbery for a lunch. Too bad they are changing things lately."}
{"text":"This little place (very little seating, be prepared to order to go) has amazing bagels. Many different flavors to choose from. You can order a breakfast style with eggs, bacon or sausage or they have board head meat and a few choices of cream cheese.   During the week they use to have a great breakfast special, the sign is still up but they don't offer it any more  If you live a new York style bagel, you have to try these!"}
{"text":"Tried the rainbow bagel very early in the morning. The owner was a quiet but polite gentleman. Fresh cream cheese spread, I had blueberry. It was sooo good."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have great breakfast sandwiches and good coffee.   It's cheap, fast, fresh and just good.   There are places to sit inside and outside but it does get very crowded inside (especially on the weekends).   Their bacon is strangely good......and my favorite thing to get is the bacon egg and cheese ADD cream cheese."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast place in Glendale. It's super close to Midwestern University and on my way to work in the mornings. The bagels are big and fresh with plenty of cream cheese. I like to switch off getting the Everything Bagel with plain cream cheese and the Breakfast Bagel Sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese.   But the one thing I would recommend the most here is their Reuben Sandwich. I'm not a huge fan of deli meat sandwiches but this is one of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. Yes, life. Imagine pastrami, sauerkraut, provolone, and thousand island dressing on rye bread (also able to sub bagel). Mm mm good. For something lighter, try the pepper crack turkey sandwich. Solid. Both sandwiches are a good size.  Service is adequate and fast. I usually get it to-go since there's not much seating inside. They also have pretty good coffee. I've been here at least ten times and I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have ordered bagels from this place far more often that we probably should.  We just can't stay away.  The bagels are tasty and moist, chewy yet soft.  We always get the egg, cheese and bacon bagel sandwich and the chorizo burrito.  They both come cut in half so we exchange halves so we can each have half of both meals.  This is the way to go.  We always get extra egg and extra meat on the bagel sandwich though because otherwise the sandwich is a little flat.  It only raises the price by a bit though so I reccommend ordering it that way.  The coffee is tasty and I never drink straight up coffee.  Any day of the week, make sure you come before 10am because that's when everyone and their mother shows up."}
{"text":"Fast service and a really good bagel. The breakfast special (bagel sandwich with a coffee or drink) will take care of you on your way to work when you oversleep and can't get it together at home on a Monday morning. Bagels are huge and delicious.   Not a whole lot of room inside for a leisurely breakfast in the mornings so a better option for grab & go. Boar's Head meats for your sandwiches, too, so you could call ahead and order something for lunch. My dry cleaners is right next door and it's right off of the 101, so I'll be in for breakfast most Monday mornings when I am running late."}
{"text":"TLDR: Bagels and sandwiches are good with good selection. Sandwiches may be a little pricey. Service is so-so, but fast. Great for a quick lunch!  I really enjoy going to Hot Bagel. It helps that it's so close to Midwestern University and better than eating on campus all the time. I personally think that the deli sandwich prices are a little bit pricier than other places, but the sandwich has a fair amount of meat on it. I usually get the reuben and it's never disappointed me.   The service here is okay. They're usually really busy, so they just try to keep the line moving. They are nice, but you can tell that they are trying to get people out quickly. I personally appreciate this, so it doesn't bother me at all. On a slower day, they are super helpful and friendly. I'll be staying a regular."}
{"text":"Had the cravings for a bagel with lox and capers for the past few days and decided to feed my cravings. I was in the area and decided to stop by this establishment. I was approached by this lady who took my order without asking me if I wanted a meal. She just assumed I wanted a meal and that wasn't the case. I just proceeded with the transaction as I was eager to try out there bagels.   Now to the the bagel w/ lox and capers was not anything out of the ordinary despite the 4.5 reviews here on yelp. The bagel was a bit tough to chew as I believe the bagels were leftover from the morning, albeit I arrived later in the afternoon. Also I was hoping to be eggs on the bagel but seemed to be left out and there was bit much of cream cheese to bread ratio. Other than that, Hot Bagels was just average to me personally."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming into this location for a bagel. I walked up to the register, and the woman did not greet me. I had to say hello first for her to say hello. None of the staff was smiling, and they stare at the customers. Very rude for a business to start off that way and make a customer not feel welcomed. I ordered a bagel with cheese turkey and chicken. My bill came out to $11.35. I asked if I can have the chicken removed from my order and the woman said \"no, not now, it's already being made\"(which it was not being made at that time). I kindly told her again that I didn't want the chicken on there and she told the cook to remove the chicken, after the fact that it was actually being made.  Then she said \"you're good to go\". I asked if she could adjust my transaction and she said \"no I am not giving you your money back\". What kind of a business will not adjust the transaction for a customer if something is returned or removed?? Mind you, the sign for my meal said $5.25 for any bagel with egg cheese and meat on it. Apparently turkey is not classified as a meat and it is an additional charge. No where in the store did it say that turkey was an additional charge. I understood that adding an extra meat is an additional charge, but not for the original meat. This place does not care about the customer, very rude staff, and it was a horrible first impression for me. Not to mention, the girl is popping gum in her mouth and blowing bubbles with it while making customer's orders, and the guy that's supposed to be cooking is staring and smirking at me while al of this is going on. I was very unhappy with this \"service\" and I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Best bagels Ive ever had! I visit a few times a month and I have probably tried 80% of the menu, nothing is bad! Try the different flavors of cream cheese, the garlic one is so good!"}
{"text":"On a whim this morning I decided to drive  down and get the wife and I bagels. I have never been here before but the reviews seemed pretty good. I got there around 9am and there were about 10 people already enjoying some food. I was promptly greeted by a nice gentleman who took my order of a jalapeño bagel with cream cheese and an Asiago bagel with cream cheese. I also ordered another of each, plain, to have the next day. The total cost was just under 7 bucks. It took less than two minutes for my order to be finished and be on my way. The bagels were nice and crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. There was also plenty of cream cheese, no skimping here. My wife and i truly enjoyed these bagels and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend hot bagels to anyone."}
{"text":"Love HB! I don't come as often as I used to since I moved out of the area but bet your bottom dollar whenever I'm up here, I stop and get my fix! The breakfast sandwiches on a bagel of your choice are my go to but even something as simple as a plain bagel with shmear is delicious! Same great taste every time! Love it here!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place! Their bagels are better then anyone else's in the valley! And their breakfast sandwiches are to die for!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for good bagels. Maybe that it because I am from New York and its in my blood??? I used to live in some apartments close to here and since I moved away I have been craving it ever since. These bagels are different and probably because they are run by a European family. They have a pretty good special on their breakfast sandwiches during the week if you get a chance to stop by. On the weekends they get very busy and may run out of your bagel of choice so try to get their early!"}
{"text":"Cold, hard and old Went to Hot Bagels twice, first time near closing time. The bagels were cold, hard and stale, had to throw it away. Giving them a second chance, I went at 10 am since they say they make them everyday. Ordered 6 and my home is no more than 5 min away. Once again, cold, hard and stale. Called and they said they make them once a day early in the morning. If they leave them out, that explains a lot. If they put them in the refrigerator, then I guess they are not aware that bread stales 6 times faster in the refrigerator. Either way, I will never go back.  I can't comment about the other stuff they sell, but as for bagels, KEEP AWAY, unless you have strong teeth."}
{"text":"Today is my last day going here after years of visits. It's slowly gone downhill over the past few months. Between bagels that have the consistency of cardboard and an ever changing staff for the worse, it's just not the same anymore. There's too many other good bagel shops on my way to work worth earning my business."}
{"text":"So good! Love starting my morning off here!"}
{"text":"The meat here is very high quality and taste very superior to other bagel places. I love how you can choose any bagel to make a sandwich with. Chocolate chip beef pastrami with pepper jack cheese was amazing. I got just because I was feeling a little wild. The cookies are huge and a great price for what you get. The workers there seem to always be on their feet hustling out the orders. I've been here at least 5 times and I feel like there is a new experience each time with the variety of choices."}
{"text":"Great place for quick breakfast in the morning! The staff are always helpful and the food never disappoints. I love their egg, bacon, and cheese bagels but they also have a variety of many other different bagel types and combos."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been coming here since I was a kid and I get the same thing for breakfast every time. The staff is always prompt and friendly.   I suggest getting an Asiago Cheese bagel Toasted, with lox cream cheese, ham, egg, and Swiss cheese. If you like smoked Salmon, then this breakfast sandwich is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"I will add my voice and vote. Some of the best bagel anywhere.  Sorry essa bagel in NYC these guys have the secret too. Will never come to phoenix without going here."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  My mouth waters just thinking about my all-time favorite thing here:  Smoked Nova Lox, atop fresh cream cheese, capers, onions (sometimes I skip them depending on my plans later that day), tomatoes, on a freshly toasted onion bagel.  Yummmm!  My husband loves their egg, meat, and cheese breakfast bagel sandwiches.  They also have pretty good coffee!  I've also tried their egg salad and tuna salad, and both are good.  Someday I will try their bagel dogs and their baked goods always look tasty!  Their sandwiches are so large that I never even think of ordering a dessert, but I think that needs to change so I can you tell if their desserts are good or not ;-)   Although this place is always pretty crowded, especially on the weekends, the staff here is top-notch; they run like a well-oiled machine!  I've never waited more than ten minutes for my food to be ready."}
{"text":"Perfect west valley morning day:  Hike Tbird with your pup, even more basic, with your goldlendoodle.  Grab a coffee at coffee bean because once you move out of the west valley, you'll understand that Phoenix only has starbucks and Dutch bros...   Go to Hot Bagels because nothing can compare to it. My husband and I dream about bagels and get cravings for Everything bagel toasted with bacon egg and cheese with cream cheese. He gets 2 eggs. But seriously the authenticity of the food and how they cook it right in front of you. Real egg sunny side up, meat from the deli, homemade bagels. Must I keep on going.. have I convinced you?  Also come during lunch time... their sandwiches: the best!  Enough said."}
{"text":"Good Bagels... Good Coffee... Friendly Service...  I gotta remember this place is here more often.... just a mile from my house and easy to get to."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town. Handmade, fresh - their cream cheese  options are amazing too. We frequent this place and have never had a less than five start experience. Also, did I mention they do boars head? Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels!! If they wanted to give you some more meat on the breakfast sandwiches it would be just like back east! The only complaint I have is that my family orders the same exact thing every time we go there and yet every time it's a different price total. Kinda strange but still excellent food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since middle school, never disappoints! I would even go as far as saying the bagels are better than New York!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bagel shop!! My go to order is the Taylor ham (extra), cheese, and egg on a toasted plain bagel!! So yummy!!! Not a lot of places have Taylor ham so it's awesome that I found an amazing bagel shop that serves it! The staff is great too, which is also a plus!!Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It takes me back to my childhood when my Dad would bring home hit bagels with Nova Scotia Salmon"}
{"text":"Bacon, egg, and cheese on a plain bagel. That is morning awesomeness.  These guys make bagels and they make the hot (and good). You come in and get in line. You order your bacon, egg and cheese, on a plain bagel for yourself and a dozen bagels sliced (or quartered) for the office with a pile of cream cheese. They put the 13 bagels in a big grocery bag and holler out your order a few minutes later.   The line moves fast and, though you may think it is a soup nazi thing, they are really very nice.   This is a great place to get bagels for a bunch of people (they will even include tomatoes if you ask) and to eat a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a plain bagel while you bring the bagels back to the office.  Did I mention my favorite is the bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich?"}
{"text":"Great bagels/food and great atmosphere.  It's amazing how quick they can get the food out. Worth the wait if the line is long."}
{"text":"This is going to be our daily morning spot for breakfast now. The bagels are perfectly crunchy and chewy. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Bought dozen+1 bagels this week.  Bagels were fresh.  I really like the marble rye bagel.  I also bought a small tub of sundried tomato cream but I didn't really care for the taste of it. I'll be back for bagels and next I'll stick to the veggie cream instead of straying from what I know."}
{"text":"As you may know... I eat a lot of bagels. When I am on the west-sieed and need a bagel, I go here. The bagels are huge! The cream cheese is pretty damn tasty as well. Don't know what they do to it but it is special here. I got addicted to this place when I went to school across the street 10 years ago. I would get here early and study while engaging in stress eating at its finest. The coffee is coffee, the service is fast, the prices are reasonable. What more can you ask? Did I mention the bagels are huge here? Better count them as 1.25 bagels if your countin calories. My wife is gluten free and would never eat here. But she never goes to Glendale anyways."}
{"text":"Thanks for the invitation but I've been there before they do not put enough meat on any of the sandwiches a little pricey taste good just not enough me so before you go stop by the deli at fries grab you some meat go over and add it to your sandwich thank you"}
{"text":"I get my breakfast here on a pretty regular basis, seeing as I work nearby. Having the tastebuds of a picky child, I always either get a toasted and buttered blueberry bagel, or the pbj toasted bagel. Both have always been delicious, and prepared in a very timely manner! Even if the business owner isn't always sunshine and flowers, it's still a pretty solid place to go for morning bagels/sandwiches/what-have-you. Of course, it helps that it's right next to a Starbucks. ;)"}
{"text":"Closest thing I'll get to a New York deli! Love that they have salt bagels and egg bagels! Can't get those at very many delis! Staff could be a little more friendly but I understand they're trying to move the line quickly because they get so busy."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time, just like the lil bagel shops in NYC, minus the NYC ATTITUDE...hee, hee!!!  Enjoying a REAL NYC bagel while WAITING for my sis to get implants at the dentist across the street! Yummmmm!!! i got an everything bahel with garlic cream cheese, cant wait to come back and try one of their breakfast sandwiches...yummmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for bagels, great prices on their breakfast items! Can't go wrong, wish they had a spot in the east valley"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times. Customer service is not the best.  I felt very rushed to order. I ordered the BLT on a bagel make it double decker twice. The first time it was amazing. I sat outside enjoyed breakfast. The jalepeno bagel had crunch on the outside but soft on the inside, just enough mayo, lettuce, tomato and lots of bacon. The second time i went back it was a week later and i had my mom with me so we sat inside. We ordered, i had BLT double decker and mom order a bagel with cream cheese. They made the food with the same dirty hands that touched my money i paid with. My bagel was made completly different cut into thirds and hardly no bacon. Mom went back and asked for more cream cheese and they took the bagel she had bit off and added more cream cheese and the knife went right back into the container for the next use. I almost feel out of my chair. That is gross! As we sat there i looked around. The salmon in the cooler is just hanging out in an open package no date no proper packaging. The bottom of the cooler on the outside has black mold. Made me think what else do they not clean. We will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"I hate when I approach a counter and get met with a walleyed stare. Nothing makes me lose my appetite faster than feeling like I should explain why I'm here. Got a bagel ham and cheese, it was as good as a bagel egg and cheese can be. Coffee is..... okay...I could take this place or leave it. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Located near the bike store on the southwest corner of 59th and the 101, this place is a real gift hidden in plain sight.  Hot bagels has been in my life for a long time. They have some awesome home-made bagels and quality deli meats that you can't miss. I like to try different things when I come in and they have all been pretty tasty and for a good price. The thing I get the most is sausage and cheese in a jalapeño bagel with a side of coffee... and they have flavored creamer!! It's a great place if you're on the go and if you want to chat a bit with your friend, there's some outside seating options. The inside is a little small and can get a bit crowded sometimes. Enjoy your order at hot bagels!!"}
{"text":"Pretty quick considering how busy they are. Kind of crowded but the food is yummy! I recommend a hot sandwich, the cold ones I have tried weren't as good."}
{"text":"I have lived in Arizona for ten years and have tried every bagel place within reach. Desperate for a NY style bagel that so many deli's in the area claim to make, Hot Bagels & Deli is the ONLY one to date to have an authentic NY style bagel that is filled with flavor and the perfect texture we east coasters crave.  I have to admit, I was skeptical when someone suggested trying them, certain I was going to be disappointed once again, but not this time.  This place is the real deal!  Thank you Hot Bagels for a taste of home."}
{"text":"Been in here more times than I can count.  Likely have a stake at this point in one of the boilers...  There is a rhythm to this place.  Like a hectic Starbucks (do these exist anymore?) or the DMV.  Bottom line is that It takes a few passes to get the swing of it.  Don't roll in all Einsteins-fresh and go \"hey, what about my microwave heated egg patty?!?!?\"  Get to know this little gem and let them get to know you.  It's a dance people, it takes a few turns to get it.  After that, I believe you will experience a excellent value, consistency, and yes - friendly and helpful staff that I look forward to saying \"good morning\" too.    BTW - one of the few places that will keep me drinking hot coffee in the summer due to their Kona!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a couple coffees and a bagel sandwich one Saturday mid-morning. The place was packed! I ordered a plain bagel with ham & cheese (no egg), but when I opened it up, there was egg. :( That's okay, they were super busy and I know it happens. They use Boar's Head deli meats, which are delicious. For being a bagel joint, they have quite an extensive menu. Various cold & hot sandwiches, breakfast burritos, and sweet treats. They also sell their meats, cheese, flavored cream cheeses, and a few other items by the pound. They are a little hidden, at the far east end of the center, behind Bank of America, but it seemed obvious that it wasn't hard to find for all the people there!"}
{"text":"The best bagels and bialys in AZ! The staff is super friendly, the place is welcoming and the food is delicious! We've been coming for years and no one makes bagels better than Hot Bagels & Deli!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix from Brooklyn, NY & was pleasantly surprised by the bagels at Hot Bagels. I wouldn't say they're 'the best' I've ever had, but definitely sufficiently scratch my ny bagel itch.   Downside: the coffee isn't that great."}
{"text":"Great food but the price is ridiculous. What we know as a New Yorker and which is usually $4-8 in price was an $11 bagel sandwich and their lox was not the best."}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast sandwiches, decent prices.  Not a very big place but I never want to sit down anyway, it's a great place to stop before work, or in the morning after a binger.  They use boar's head meat and have tons of selections. Everyone that has helped me has always been really nice.   I'm pretty upset that I moved away from this place but just typing it makes me crave a ham egg and cheese bagel. YUM!"}
{"text":"Simply the best bagels in the valley. They make them all right in the store not premise like other places. Good sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Went in today to try a breakfast bagel and it was so good! Bagels were fresh and soft, and with so many different breakfast items to choose from it made it a hard decision, but I was able to decide on ham and egg. They are very filling so you can get in and out with a meal under $5. There is also read, soda, sandwiches, bagels with cream cheese. It's a small shop, but has plenty of inside and outside seating. Great little place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Are you looking to tempt your taste buds? Then, look no more! This is one of the best places to get breakfast or lunch. The Nova Lox on the everything bagel is my favorite. I love the everything bagel with cream cheese too.  Don't be fooled by the exterior. This is a New York style deli which serves sandwiches and delicious desserts in additional to the tasty breakfast items. Do not worry about what to order. You will enjoy any choice you make. The food will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Omg! Sooo good. I found this place by accident and im so glad i did.  Fast,  friendly service and the food is delicious! I ordered a bacon,egg and cheese bagel and it was so fresh and yummy. I will definately be returning to try out their lunch menu which looks equally delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Hot Bagels! I did a review for the Happy Valley location, but must have missed the review on this location. First off I've been coming here for years. I love the bagel breakfast sandwich. On my last visit I had a ham, egg, cheese sandwich on a everything bagel. Delicious as always and fills me up! I recommend Hot Bagels to anyone that is looking for a quick and good breakfast. On a side not I had a buffalo chicken bagel sandwich for lunch at the other location and it was awesome as well, so for breakfast or a hearty lunch sandwich come here!"}
{"text":"First impressions last a lifetime.  Case in point, I have only been to Hot Bagels and Deli one time. I was wanting, no CRAVING, a toasted bagel with cream cheese to the point of despair. I've been to another bagel shop up off the I-17 with a very similar name (wonder if it's the same owners??) but the results were quite different.  Here's the \"first impressions\" that were... well... impressed on me: 1) only 1 person in the shop on a Saturday morning. Weird. Places like this are usually busy. 2) difficult to read menu. I didn't want to order a difficult bagel. HA. 3) cashier/cook/manager? didn't really \"greet\" me as a customer. Was more like \"What do you want?\" Would you like a side of smile this morning? Good grief, I'm not a happy person but honestly... 4) the bagel was EGGY. I don't know how else to explain it. It literally tasted of eggs and was very chewy. I appreciate a nice chew to my bagel but the eggy-ness of this one disappointed my tastebuds and left me wishing I'd gone to Starbucks.  Too bad, really. I love a good bagel shop and might give this one another try. But as the adage goes, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... wait, how does this go, George W.? ;)"}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick cup of coffee and a breakfast bagel.  Everytime I order it comes out super quick and it pretty good.  Very casual and its not big but the service is great.  The orange juice is in plastic bottles and I don't think tastes very good but so far everything else has been good."}
{"text":"Customer service is not the best and neither are the bagels. I'm from NJ and the bagels are not as good as back home. I always find that the bagels don't taste very fresh. They're a little dry and somtimes taste a bit too salty."}
{"text":"Busy little place rightfully so. Good quality product, no skimping and freshly baked bagels. Parking is a bit of a challenge too, but worth it. Check it out."}
{"text":"The best egg breakfast sandwich EVER. They  fry the eggs on a stove, not a microwave.. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in town. They freeze well also so I buy extra. Nice breakfast sandwiches and you can eat outside."}
{"text":"The bagels here are incredible. There is always a huge demand and sometimes they run out so get there early. I like the atmosphere and they are very conveniently located off the freeway.  Some of the teenagers running the frontend of this place could use an attitude adjustment when it comes to delivering customer service, but overall I am a repeat customer and glad Hot Bagel is here. Be careful not to show your contempt for customers when they ask for something and \"yer out\" Ultimately the customer service will decide whether I continue to come in."}
{"text":"I trulely enjoy this place, it is so good! I havent really had anything I wasnt a fan of.... I wish I could go in here more often than I do. The only reason I dont eat here often it is pretty pricey. I find myself making a quick switch to subway 7 out of 10 times, which is right next door due to the prices are a little outrageous. But if you have the patience to stand in line, and be able to atleast spend $7 min for a sandwich than this place is a somewhere you should try atleast once."}
{"text":"Okay. This place amazes me. Hidden in a strip center by Home Depot. Out of the blue, we wanted bagels. This place came simply called HOT BAGELS. I walk in and the place is jam packed. Can barely move around. It's amazing because they serve boars head meat and you don't see that usually unless it's a high-end deli. Needless to say I ordered a turkey sandwich that was the size of a basketball. They don't skimp on the boars head. And it was very reasonable. I suggest you go and try this place immediately"}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service in the deli business. Consistently make orders incorrect and then are smug when the customer complains."}
{"text":"Large awesome bagels. Boar's head meat for sandwiches makes for an awesome meal. People are kind and they are open on Holidays and for that early morning need. (5AM) Great place, always busy. Good food. We enjoy coming here and taking bagels home often."}
{"text":"I visit Hot Bagel 3-4 times a week.  Sausage egg and cheese on an everything bagel.  Can't ask for a better deal.  An awesome fresh cooked breakfast sandwich for $5.  You'll only need one so it's cheaper than any fast food joint out there and much much better."}
{"text":"I love this place I love this place I love this place! I rarely have bagels but when I do I come here. Dollar bagels, can't get any better than that. I get the Asiago toasted and a wheat toasted with peanut butter and jelly. So yummy, and super affordable. Just go here if you want a bagel."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  The food is excellent, fast service and the staff is very friendly!  Reminds me of back East (NY/MA area) where I grew up!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE their bagels!!!! Whether you get one toasted with cream cheese (which they usually pile on) or as an egg sandwich, the bagels are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing honestly. Bland service and ok food. The menu didn't tell you what cheese bread or veggie options you can choose from for sandwiches.   The food wasn't anything special either. Expected more from a place with as high a rating. It's just a simple sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Sill the best breakfast bagel sandwich"}
{"text":"I love this place! Especially this location. They are so friendly and memorize your order (I may or may not come too often)!"}
{"text":"What an awesome hole in the wall. Small restaurant but so clean and comfortable to be in. My girlfriend and I had the breakfast special ($4.40 for a breakfast sandwich and coffee) and it was perfect! Staff was so friendly and helpful and made some great recommendations before we chose our meal. Definitely will be returning here when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I can take it or leave it.  I went here a few times and always got the hot bagel sandwiches. They are fresh, decent, VERY THICK sandwiches. I like how it doesn't feel/taste unnecessarily more unhealthy that it potentially can.  However, it's not my thing and doesn't satisfy my craving for really good food."}
{"text":"Mix and match whatever bagels and toppings/inserts you like on your bagels. Breakfast bagels are the best...try out my own version, Spinach Bagel with sausage, egg, cheese and tomatoes - yummiest! The kids love it as well. It's family owned and operated...come and support them!"}
{"text":"This place has great food the wait is a little long and it's kind of small and not a lot of seating so even if you get a seat you risk having someone's butt in your face while they're waiting for food that would be my only complaint is that they get a bigger spot"}
{"text":"Quality bagels, meats, and staff. Cooked to order breakfast is amazing"}
{"text":"You can not go wrong with this place, any bagel sandwich you can possibly order is amazing.  I usually decide to try new things, and i am not close to running out of combination, the owners/staff are amazingly helpful and are some of the most friendly and people in the biz.  Try a turkey, bacon, egg, and cheese on a jalepeno bagel.. awesome   And to \"dennis c.\" maybe you should not order the salt bagel next time, just a thought."}
{"text":"just like the other location i have been to, it is great.. very consistant with the quality and service.  ham bacon egg and cheese on a toasted egg bagel FTW"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Wife and I frequent this place often. At least 2-3 times a week. Breakfast meals with great taste and amazing prizes. The coffee is great. They use a kona blend. I just wished they had a bigger place :)"}
{"text":"Love this place I'm new York born and raised and I can tell you their bagels are definitely New York bagels.  I was so excited when I tried these bagels they definitely taste like home. Such a good lil surprise in az"}
{"text":"Although the reviews here were mixed, I had to check it out for myself. I went in with a simple order for four bagels. I thought I saw the man (who I believe was the owner), only put three bagels in the bag. I reminded him that I asked for four. He looked at the bag and said there were four in there. I paid and took the bag and left. Luckily, I took a look at the bag and there were only three bagels in it. I went back and pleasantly told the man that I ordered and paid for four bagels but there were only three in the bag. He seemed annoyed, put another bagel in my bag and rolled his eyes.  I will say, the bagels are good. I'm just trying to decide if they're good enough that I would return to a business where the owners treat their customers so rudely."}
{"text":"Been going to Hot Bagels for a long time. Love the food, never had anything bad come from here. Today I tried their burritos the salsa didn't taste home made tasted like it came from a jar. At the very least create a relationship with a filiburtos nearby and get their salsa or make your own."}
{"text":"Great place! I love going to hot bagel over Einsteins because you see them crack eggs over the stove and watch them pull out the tray of lox from the fridge. The food is always fresh and you can see that they take pride in their kitchen. Ever since this place has been open,they have always had great customer service! Their portions are hearty and filling too."}
{"text":"HOT DAMN!!! Those breakfast bagel sandwiches are the SHIT!! I've never been there for lunch, but I try to get there as often as possible for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Much like another store (same owner) off Carefree Highway, this place is also awesome (see my other review of that place). Real New York bagels and a grill (not microwaved eggs). Only complaint is I wish it were bigger. Don't count on seating at peak times. Otherwise, awesome. This owner/family has the formula."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast bagel sandwich. The people reminded me of the best bagels back on Long Island!"}
{"text":"The best bagel i have ever had. We go at least once a month. Everything bagel and creme cheese is the bomb"}
{"text":"They were out of cheese bagels at 10am and their \"chive\" cream cheese is made with green onion. Not chive. They are not the same thing. Blech won't go back."}
{"text":"Bagels on display reminded me of my previous bagel stop, Noah's bagels =]  I ordered a traditional garlic bagel with cream cheese for here. Paid more than I wanted to but I figured I could deal since this place seemed to be a local favorite. Sat down when the \"heated\" bagel was handed to me on a plastic plate. Tried to take my first bit but the bagel was MUCH bigger than i expected haha mainly because of how much cream cheese they spread over it. Which would be awesome if I loved cream cheese but I don't so more than half of it ended up in the trash.  But the bagel itself was nice and toasty. I took each bite like it was my last and enjoyed it like no other. Usually don't get full off one bagel but these are pretty filling.  overall, I was impressed but not amazed. Ive had worse and I've had better."}
{"text":"A friend gave us this hot tip....best bagels! Not so big inside but great for small table or to go!"}
{"text":"Love the bagels  have been going here for years!  Excellent  service"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Been coming here for years... No longer live in surprise and still drive 25 minutes for great bagels! Bagels are fresh, nova sandwiches are great and even the home fries are exceptional!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick breakfast or lunch.  Prices a reasonable, and the bagel sandwiches are quite good and they are large.   In addition,  the people are nice and the service is great.  In short, this place is a winner!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for ages. And I really like their bagels and their California chicken sandwich. But one thing I cannot forgive is inconsistency. Sometimes the chicken will be over cooked or under cooked, or the avocado will be black or they won't have the right bread... If I could depend on them to give me the same sandwich every time I came in, I would be there every week. You can't win em all."}
{"text":"Tips:  Bagels 85 cents each. $4.97 for a Taylor Ham, Egg and Cheese bagel (Taylor ham is saltier than regular ham)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A small shop that you wouldn't think twice about with a generic name like \"Hot Bagels\", but surprisingly serves great bagel sandwiches!  Great place for a good tasting and filling breakfast."}
{"text":"Jalepeno Cheese Bagel with Jalepeno Cream Cheese is out of this world!  Always packed because they have great food!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place for breakfast. The service is quick and friendly and their breakfast sandwiches are delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was mostly tasty. Everything bagel was a bit too salty. Lox was as you expect it. They messed up both our orders, but it wasn't a big deal since it was still good. I just wanted lox and bagel and got the lox sandwich. Fiance wanted bagel with ham and he got it with bacon."}
{"text":"Delicious local bagel shop. If they're busy when you arrive dont be discouraged, the plow through a line of people rapidly. Get there early, because they do make bagels daily and will run out of some of the more popular flavors by mid-day. My only wish is that they would switch their coffee- we don't like it and always stop elsewhere for our coffees."}
{"text":"The best bagels ever. I don't know what this place does to their food, but I'm pretty sure nothing else could drag me hungover out of bed on a Sunday morning. I recommend the bacon egg and cheese breakfast bagel, add cream cheese. The later you go, the less busy it is, but they do run out of bagels often."}
{"text":"Kind people, great food, open early, and consistently amazing. Great bagels for lunch or breakfast. Their sand which bagels are great as well as bacon egg and cheese bagels. Love this little bagel shop!!!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what it should be. As a bagel place/deli it delivers quick, cheap, yummy food. What more could you ask for? I had an everything bagel with cream cheese, and while it wasn't my beloved brooklyn bagel, it filled the craving and tasted delicious while doing so. They also had bialys which I haven't seen since I lived back in NY. They also have breakfast platters, breakfast sandwiches/burritos, and deli sandwiches. The staff behind the desk was very friendly and welcoming. Better than expected in the middle of Surprise.  Overall, if you're in the mood for a bagel, this place is LEAGUES over what the chains have to offer."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Always a bomb breakfast  joint to  grub at. Always made fresh on the spot. Love hot bagels. If ever in the area stop by. I can assure you will go back."}
{"text":"Whilst visiting my folks in Glendale, my brother woke up early and grabbed the family a baker's dozen bagels from here.  The bagels are huge! Great taste, texture and size. The cream cheese tub was delicious too.   Five big stars. Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Sausage egg and cheese bagel is delicious! The coffee is great, and the staff is wonderful. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Well first off I want to say the man up at the front guessing the owner is not very welcoming. Over priced. Preparation of food very unsanitary lady was not wearing any gloves during preparation of food while wearing rings on her fingers that collects germs! Food took 15 minutes to prepare and we are talking 1 VERY SMALL breakfast burrito..why? All I will give them credit on is their cinnamon raisin cream cheese being delicious and even though the burrito was prepared unsanitary and very small it was still good."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, small breakfast or lunch. This place tends to crowd around 9ish with teenagers reliving last night's partying, which can sometimes be very entertaining. We enjoy the bagel sandwiches and cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service and delicious, fresh bagels!  We had breakfast sandwiches and they were really good!  The chocolate chip bagel is really yummy warm, tastes like dessert!  Very busy little shop!  We sat outside to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast  Stop. Limited seating and it gets very busy so your best bet is to call ahead and pick up the order"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim, so glad I did! These bagels are amazing!!! They have captured the perfect crust with a soft slightly dense center. I am a very snobby bagel connoisseur and these exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"I visit often, Staff if friendly and quick. Bagels are fresh and thick."}
{"text":"To summarize briefly: the bagels are great, with good selection, the service is average, but very fast, and the amount of cream cheese they put on is crazy.   Overall, it's probably one of the better places to get fresh baked bagels in the area, and you get a good value for the price. I always have to ask for \"easy on the cream cheese\" though, because more often than not, there is so much on the bagels that I end up squeezing over half of it off as I eat it. The location is also convenient right off the 101, and across from Midwestern University."}
{"text":"Yummy but extremely overpriced - more consistency needed with this the registers, different charges on different days. My Family loves the cream cheese selection but $10 for a breakfast sandwich is not pocket friendly."}
{"text":"My fave place! I live for the asiago or the everything bagel toasted with jalapeno cream cheese, and my husband lives for the breakfast burritos. Sometimes we mix it up with a blueberry bagel with blueberry cream cheese or a side of bacon/sausage. BLT at lunch is good too. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them two stars because their food was good. Other than that I will agree with everyone else, their service was horrible.  It was my first time there, but I had looked at their menu ahead of time and knew what I wanted. When I walked in I was the only person in the restaurant and yet the woman at the counter acted as if I was interfering with her work and like I was a waste of time. She was rude and took no time explaining anything to me. And when I didn't know what to do (because I was new and didn't know) she treated me like an idiot and did nothing to help me out. It definitely made me feel not welcome and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My girlfriend has been dying for me to try this place out. \"Such a good deal\", she says. And it really is. Solid bagels with a ton of meat (I had the cracked pepper turkey) and a bag of chips for like 6 bucks? I'll take it. Plus the coffee is hot and strong. Not weak at all. Overall, a good solid place I intend on going back to."}
{"text":"Amazing joint! Love the atmosphere.. The dude at the counters kinda rude but, the food makes up for it! mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I always get their sausage double egg and cheese on an Asiago bagel or everything bagel. Priced fair and always so fresh. They're Kona coffee is also very tasty. Even if they have a long line it goes pretty quick. Never a complaint this place is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews -but I've had enough. This Hot Bagels location has the rudest employees that I have ever come across. I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2PM for some bagels. The sign on the door said they were open until 4. I normally go to the Hot Bagels on 59th and the 101, but I was passing by and thought, I'll give them one more try...BIG MISTAKE. I walked through the front door and all the chairs were on the tables and they were putting things away, weird since they were open for another 2 hours. I went up to the counter and noticed the bagel bins were empty. When I asked if they had anymore bagels, the employee looked at me, rolled her eyes and sighed \"of course we do\". When I asked for chocolate chip bagels, she sighed and rolled her eyes again and said, we are out of those. When I asked her what they had left, she said she didn't know - but she knew she didn't have those. My response? Sorry I tried to give you business. I will never set foot in your store again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to get a bagel here.  I was starved and the blueberry bagels sounded great.  Unfortunately, the jalapeno bagels were laying on top of the blueberry ones and I really didn't want my blueberries to be spicy and taste like a mexican oompa-loompa ... so I went with the gyro.  It was really good.  Not the most amazing gyro I've ever had (that belongs to It's Greek To Me) but it was one of the better gyros in Phoenix.  I probably would have given this place 4 stars but having your bagels all mushed together is not a way to get me to come back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Liz at the front is very rude and will talk to you very rudely in front of everyone there. I also ordered all my bagels toasted and not one was done. When I was suppose to go back and have my order redone, no one had a clue what I was talking about after the manager Arta told me that she would have my name and order down. Then again LIZ felt the need to be rude again. I will never, never go back to this place after experiencing this not once but twice!!!"}
{"text":"Must have passed by here hundreds of times but never thought to stop in until I moved to the area! It's immediately off the freeway on 59th Ave & 101. Looks like a normal little deli but it really is an awesome find. I woke up craving a really good bagel, and this place is right down the street so I wanted to try it out. These bagels are incredible! The cream cheese is delicious as well. The place was packed with families on a Sunday morning but service was quick and friendly. We got ours to go and waited no more than 5 minutes. The menu has endless possibilities; the sandwiches looked amazing too. I forgot to mention the prices are a real steal too. Not one of those bagel places that ridiculously overcharges, got two bagels with cream cheese for $4.25! Will absolutely be coming back as this is my new neighborhood bagel spot :)"}
{"text":"Wow what a find this place was.    -Fresh bagels -Tons of cream cheese options -fresh ground coffee  I had a lox and plain cream cheese bagel and it was terrific.  They didn't skimp on the lox at all which was great.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing.    I will for sure make a trip back to this place when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Amazing! I haven't had a good bagel since I lived in New York. Coffee and a bagel, classic :) This place exceeds my expectations."}
{"text":"I'll be honest...I was looking for Einstein Brothers bagels, and didn't find them right away, so I decided to stop in here.  It actually turned out to be a good decision!  There was one man working the joint.  I went with an everything bagel with cream cheese, and a garlic bagel, plain.  Total for both bagels was a little under $4.00.  Not bad..not bad at all.  Here is how they were..........  Everything bagel with cream cheese-  First of all, this was a big ass bagel!  When I unwrapped the white paper, I was impressed!  This thing had a ton of cream cheese on it and was cut in half so that it gave you 4 quarter slices of bagel to enjoy.  The everything bagel had the usual poppy seeds/garlic/salt etc on the outside and was incredibly tasty.  The outside had a nice crunch to it and the inside was nice and chewy.  I detected a hint of sourdough, too (might use a sourdough starter for their bread?  Whatever it was, it was delicious!)! This was one mighty fine bagel.  Probably the best bagel I have had in the Phoenix area since moving out here permanently.    Garlic bagel-  Delicious!  Lot's of garlic salt/pieces on it.  Crunchy outside, chewy inside, just like the everything bagel.   Overall, I was happy I \"got lost\" and found this place.  It is a bit hard to find (behind Bank of America, next to Starbucks on the corner of Bell & Grand), but it is worth the search to locate it.  These bagels were really good, prices were fair, service was to the point and it's a locally run business.  I'll be back soon enough!"}
{"text":"I was at Hot Bagel today 3/15/2016 at 12:25 to order 4 sandwiches for lunch.  We were not greeted by anyone instead the young girl said \"what do you want\"? in a rude tone.  We asked for our sandwiches to be made on plain bagels and she said \"we are out\", asked for asiago? \"we are out\" everything bagel? \"we are out\" crossiant? \"we are out\" chocolate chip? \"we are out\".  When we asked what do you have?  the blonde girl rolled her eyes!  They treated as if we were a nuisance and they were annoyed we were there.  I called on my way home to ask who their manager/owner was and they said Bruce.  Bruce if you would like to contact me please do so at cillahome@hotmail.com.  I am appalled by the way your staff treats their customers."}
{"text":"Egg Sandwiches sucked, i was visiting AZ on business i only went in because it was next to starbucks,  place kinda smelled funky too."}
{"text":"We get breakfast here every weekend. They have the best bagels and prices.  This is the only place I've found that serves Taylor ham.  I love supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here at least once a week and it's amazing! The staff is very nice, they have a great bagel selection (rainbow bagels are the best) and the breakfast platter is very good and affordable. Give this place your business! They deserve it."}
{"text":"That turkey n cheese I will be trying based off the photos I must know how big n fluffy that I see em are they that good excited"}
{"text":"Ordered Italian hero on a sub to go. Bread was so stale it was inedible. Can't just run a sandwich shop on boars head meat alone. Gotta have fresh bread too. Cmon."}
{"text":"Bagel breakfast looks great,  however, they only serve beverages in STYROFOAM cups!!!!!! Hello, how environmentally unfriendly. Plus I'm not drinking my coffee out of STYROFOAM."}
{"text":"Amazing bagels! Awesome cream cheese and fantastic lox. This place has great food although it does it get really crowed in the store, so we usually take our food to go.   If you love bagels,cream cheese and lox, you must try this place! :)"}
{"text":"I typically buy breakfast or lunch here once a weekend.  Highly recommended.  They have good lunch specials where you get a good sandwich, chips and a drink for around $6.  Also, I recommend the bagels and breakfast burritos.  I have been coming here for years. and would definitely recommend to people looking for a good local bagel shop."}
{"text":"Excellent little bagel shop. Had an onion bagel with jalapeño cream cheese which was made with real fresh jalapeños. Delicious. My wife had a wheat bagel with regular cream cheese! Delicious will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Albanian family runs this location while the others are ran by the original family of owners.  The bagels here were drier than an east coast bagel and I would consider them average.  I did like the many types of cream cheese they offered.  I had a ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich (requested cheddar instead of standard American) and was surprised that they didn't heat up the bagel at all.  There wasn't much ham in it and it was a little in the dry side.  I added a little mayonnaise (they had to out some in a cup for me since they don't have packets at this location) and it was disgusting.   Stay away from the mayo here.   They didn't have any milk for the kids to drink even from the back.  This isn't a recommended stop but they were very nice people!  Try the other two locations."}
{"text":"Hot bagels is always delicious and they offer a wide variety of bagels to choose from. I always go for their breakfast special which comes with a drink and is very affordable. I work near by and often times run up there to get a quick breakfast. They are really fast and great quality. I love their jalapeno bagels it pairs perfectly with the eggs and bacon. It's tuned away near Home Depot and boy am I glad I found it. The customer service is awesome too. They offer lunch and my coworkers say it is delicious as well but I love the breakfast too much to stray from it yet."}
{"text":"Get the breakfast sandwiches!!!!! So good! However, if you go for lunch and want something more fitting for lunch I like the Italian or the Reuben. It's messy to eat, but delicious."}
{"text":"Hot bagels is so delicious. They have a lot of bagels to choose from. Bagels are best in the morning in my opinion. I believe they are best in the morning because of cream cheese. Cream cheese gives me the trots so I choose not to eat it. But I love all the gluten that Hot Bagels provides."}
{"text":"Same as 59th Ave & Beardsley location (chain).  Bagels served up fresh, with fresh quality ingredients.  The Surprise store seems to offer more breakfast options than the Glendale location.  Cute Irish ladies with strong accents was uplifting and brought a smile to my face."}
{"text":"Tucked into corner near Subway & dry cleaners.  Chain bagel place (other location is in Surprise).  Bagels are fresh, great texture, and flavorful, but often the breakfast bagel sandwiches give me unacceptable problems (very runny, uncooked eggs for example).  Seating is a nightmare here, and the place ought to be pretty much takeout only.  Parking is atrocious during the morning rush due to the dry cleaner two doors down."}
{"text":"Been eating hot bagels since my senior year of high school (2011) and have been a die hard fan of hot bagels . Love my LOX bagel, salmon is fresh, and they are so generous. Compared to other bagel joints;)"}
{"text":"A wonderful stranger at a coffee shop told me about this place. I went in with high hopes....yet left disappointed. I must have arrived at THE BUSIEST hour. There was a line and all staff were doing something super fast. The menu had ALOT of delicious looking items  (a little too pricy for me) but hey, I order a garlic egg bagel and tried it out. They got my order in and had the bagel done within about 10 min. Not too bad. However, the bagel was too salty. They might have used garlic salt- I'm not sure. The bagelwhich a little too small for the price and not doughy enough for me. Either way it was filling but, I'm not going to be going back."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS filthy. And beyond hot. I was absolutely shocked to see how trashed this place was with 4 girls working and not one cleaning anything up. Not to mention their high chairs were stacked in the corner (so an employee put them there) with caked on crusty food. And the restraints were broken and frayed. Their sandwiches are usually great but everything else is awful"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place for breakfast. Married to a Joisey boy, and he loves it, every time I am there I hea dat accent all ova da joint."}
{"text":"It was so so.  I actually prefer Einstein Brothers Bagels."}
{"text":"This is a cute little find of a deli in my hood. They sell Boars Head to go, have a small Treatie display case, and sell bagels. I got  a chicken salad sandwich on rye, which was actually very good. I do not like bagel sandwiches so I went with the breaded option but I did get a salted bagel to take home. It is hard to find salted bagels here in AZ.   The bagel was better than most places in town but not as good as in NY and needed way more salt. I was happy to see they have NY style crumb cake too. I have not seen that out of an Entenmann's box in eons. The woman behind the counter said they ship it in from NY. It is not made fresh daily but it was still pretty good and one of the best I have had out here.   I have to admit it is a bit stressful eating here though. It is way too small and crowded.  You will probably have to share a table if you eat inside. I had to share a table with Docs in training from the university across the street. Although, now that you mention it, I am not sure that is a bad thing. Ha!  The young lady behind the counter was a gem. I  would definitely come back here now that my Favorite NY deli has closed in DT Phoenix."}
