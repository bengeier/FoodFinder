{"text":"Exactly as others stated, a small but excellent food selection.  If you're picky about your dishes, you may be disappointed, however the quality and presentation are clean and savoury. Portions are large. Very family friendly.  If you don't leave hurting, you didn't eat right."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food. Fresh ingredients, well prepared, though more attention to the sauces would have earned a fourth star. The place's real shortcoming came with the service - perfunctory at best, the young man in charge went through the motions but still managed to communicate the impression that there was somewhere else he'd rather be and that he didn't give much of a damn on way or another."}
{"text":"I posted photos of egg roll with metal bristle found. I almost threw up. I also ordered Honey Sesame Chicken and it was not fresh. There were no sesame seeds on the chicken and it was dry and tasteless. I also had the combo fried rice and combo lo mein. I found a hair in the lo mein noodles. I thought it was mine but it was wrapped around the noodle. I have never been so disgusted from food. I called the restaurant to report these findings and the guy on the phone laughed. I cannot believe how horrible this dinner was. Do not eat at Ginger China Bistro. Go to Panda Express instead."}
{"text":"A good local Chinese restaurant. Never had a bad visit out of 20+ meals. By far the go to place in Glendale for Chinese food. Not a huge menu but everything on it is fresh and tastes great."}
{"text":"How is this place even open still?  Everything was absolutely awful. My daughter and I went in for lunch.  The place was completely empty at 12:45!   You know if the appetizer is bad the rest of the meal is pretty much done for.  The pot stickers were completely flavorless.  The crispy chicken with mushroom sauce was completely inedible; the chicken tasted like it had been fried in really old oil several years ago and left to dry on the countertop.  The coconut chicken curry my daughter ordered was also devoid of flavor.  The server said three words to us the entire time we were there, and when I told him how unpleasant the meal tasted, he had no reply.  I truly wish I had asked for at least one of our meals to be taken off the bill.  ARGH!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and fresh but the service was awful. Very slow and our server gave us an appetizer on the house for the delay. They only had 1 bottle of the wine we ordered and we had to get something different for our 2nd bottle. It was not even a busy night. Maybe takeout would be better to not have to deal with slow inattentive service."}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese restaurant I will eat at. Once I started when it first opened, I have only went elsewhere once and it was a huge let down. The food here is consistent and tastes awesome! They make their won ton soup broth from scratch and it is some of the best soup I have had. I have sent my dentist here, my friends, and clients. All come back again and again! This is not your typical salty Chinese buffet, it is not a buffet at all. This is quality, freshly made Chinese food. The menu does not change ever!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm Chinese, grew up on home cooked authentic Chinese cooking, I make Chinese for dinner every night... So I know good Chinese!  This is it! Plates are huge and cheap, food is non-greasy & oily. They accommodated our diet needs.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"This is our regular date night spot. We love the food, service and prices. I would recommend Ginger over a chain like PF Chang's. Asian Pear Salad and Pot Stickers are two of our faves!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now. My kids love the orange chicken and pt stickers. Shrimp in lobster sauce is very well done. The food has been great and worth the slower service. It's a mom and pop operation so I have only seen three employees. Prices are great so it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Large portions, very tasty.  Clean  premises. Friendly staff. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here for good or friendly service! Its asian owned and operated, meaning, expect constant-loofy-rude attitude. DO go here for delicious-made-to-order authentic food. They offer a more abundant, healthier, more delicious, and cheaper food option compared to pei wei. Its worth the trip.... Just expect weird asian rude interactions."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients. The appetizers were great and the entree was amazing. The staff was very polite and helpful. Restaurant was very clean and orderly with fantastic service. Beautiful atmosphere and great food. Take out service as well."}
{"text":"I just had the honey sesame chicken and it was wonderful.  Just slightly crispy yet oh so tender.  Very delicate taste. My only wish is that someone had told me about this place sooner."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried rice! My husband and I will drive from across town to come eat here. No MSG in anything, the way it should be! The folks here are always nice and friendly! Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband & I went here for dinner tonight & thought the food was amazing. We got the spring rolls & cream puffs as an appetizer then the orange chicken & sesame chicken for our main entrees. Everything tasted great and the staff was friendly. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food ok Not very friendly Everyone that works there looks like they want to be somewhere else Didnt get order right"}
{"text":"We had a delightful meal - Combination Lo Mein & the Ginger's \"Crispy\" Chicken.  The \"crispy\" chicken was not crispy, but both of the dishes were delicious.  There was only one server who ran the reception desk, answered the phone, acted as the hostess, and waiter.  She was very efficient, but needed more help most of the time which resulted in slower-than-normal service.  They are close to getting five stars from us!"}
{"text":"I knew there was something wrong when I arrived at the restaurant at 6pm on a Saturday and the entire place was empty. I ordered Moo Shu Pork Crepes. I was served 4 small cabbage rolles with a trace of meat in them.  Also, they were not crepes, they were store bought torillas. The rest was thrown in the trash when I got home. This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had! I think the last post was a worker or owners friend. Do yourself a favor and DON'T GO."}
{"text":"Orange chicken is da bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! I have to admit I am usually timid to try a new Chinese restaurant without a friend's recommendation but glad I took the chance!  I am an Egg Foo Yung junkie and order every time I go there. The EFY is cooked fresh, not frozen like most places, and can be made any way you like.  The sauce is light, not heavy or  greasy, and DE-LISH!  The serving proportions are plentiful which means I get to enjoy the dish again for tomorrows lunch. I also love their lettuce wraps, with tofu not chicken, a welcomed substitute for any vegetarian.   Service is always pleasant, and being a frequent visitor, they have gotten to know our favorites.  I have taken several friends and family members and they all leave loving the food and requesting to return.     Check it out, you will love it."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places in Glendale. I always take my family and friends here when they visit and they all love it. They only use fresh white meat chicken which is a nice change from the deep fried stuff you get anywhere else. Their won ton soup is amazing and big enough to split. They have vegetarian dishes that are good no matter what your preferences are. This is a nice clean restaurant and it is always quite in there so you can actually talk to one another. I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"This was our first and last time here. We wanted to try out a local business close to our area and this didn't meet our standards... granted our standards wasn't very high to begin with. We ordered Beef Chow Fun and Asian Pear Salad. The salad was a disappointment especially for $8. It looked like sometime I could have easily made at home for under  $2. Romaine lettuce, half of a delicious brand Apple, half of an Asian Pear, three quartered size pieces of strawberries, three small pieces of canned mandarin oranges, and poppy seed dressing. Panera does so much better. The beef chow fun was a little better. It was like any standard beef chow fun minutes the bean sprouts. There wasn't much of the beef, onions, or green onions. Mostly noodles."}
{"text":"Very good and service. Portions were the right size. A great place for a causal date night."}
{"text":"We tried the signature ginger chicken dish and also the beef chow fun. The ginger chicken texture was great, maybe too much mushroom sauce tho, I'm glad they gave us rice with it. The beef chow fun was high quality but the beef was a bit salty. Overall a nice setting, good experience :)"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night before going to a small house party. We had been to one of the places close by, and thought that we should give this place a shot.  My girlfriend and I started off with the War Won Ton Soup.  It was pretty good.  The broth was very light and flavorful.  For entree's we had the Broccoli Beef and Mandarin Orange Chicken.  The sauce for the Broccoli Beef was a little heavy on the Soy, and the Orange Chicken was a little on the light side.  However, the chicken was fried perfectly and didn't have an overly oily taste to it.  The one thing that was lacking was the service.  It was very slow inside, and the service matched.  Based on my experience, I would go back again....however, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a lack of consistancy, judging from the reviews and the fact that the restaurant owners that were working didn't seem to be focused on anything at all.  We'll see how the next visit goes."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to's for Chinese food. The food is fresh and flavorful. The egg foo young is the kind I love with a thick gravy and everything inside the egg patty instead of just placed on top as an afterthought. My son calls it his favorite soup and orders the wonton soup. The bowl is huge and he has been eating every last bite since he was 5 years old. My only wish is that it was a little closer to me so I could get it more frequently."}
{"text":"Ginger is the best! My entire family is addicted to their delicious, fresh, non greasy, flavorful food. We moved here from the east coast and struggled to find Chinese food that was not Panda Express quality. After exhaustive research we found Ginger and now literally nothing else will do. Best in the West Valley, plus it is a small, family run business. I have not had a bad meal here, however the moo shu pork and the Mongolian beef are my favorites. Now when I go back to CT to visit no other Chinese food measures up. Go here immediately!"}
{"text":"I love this place because it is family owned and there is not an ounce of greasiness in any of their food. Everything is prepared to perfection and is super authentic. I try to spread the word about this place because they are never too busy when I go, but this is a good mine for Chinese! The Egg Foo Young is to die for, the orange beef is perfectly fried with sweetness, the combination rice and Lo Mein we can't go without getting, and the BBQ pork won ton appetizer, and lettuce wraps are all amazing!!! So fresh tasting like you're at someone's house. I can't get over how good this place is !!! Thanks to my boyfriends family for introducing me!"}
{"text":"I love to eat Chinese food. I have been to quite a few restaurants in the valley. I am also very picky to where I eat. I must say the China Bistro is at the top of my list. The staff is very attentive. The place is clean and quiet. The food is always fresh and plenty for a great price. We have made it a tradition to celebrate my husbands birthdays there.  We also try to make it there as often as we can."}
{"text":"It was an okay Chinese place. Nothing to brag about. We were there when there was only one other table there and the costumer service was still bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  We just tried for the first time and we were very impressed.  We got takeout (Citrus Beef and Ginger's Crispy Chicken with mushroom sauce)  Both were excellent.  The spring rolls were great, the crab angels could use a little more stuffing but still very tasty.  The place looks clean and nice decor too.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Me and my family enjoy our meal everytime we dine here. Whenever its Chinese food night out we come here. I always order the Madarin beef and Or the Sesame Chicken when we come and don't forget the combination fried rice."}
{"text":"First of all we were the only ones in there at 6 pm on a Saturday night. It was dark Inside and not very clean. Food was greasy and lacked flavor. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Tried for first time today after passing by for some time. I do not plan on returning. I ordered shrimp in lobster sauce. Tons of sauce but no lobster flavor. My daughter ordered chicken in ginger sauce. Again TON of sauce but no ginger flavor."}
{"text":"Last evening was my first visit to Ginger's China Bistro, and I'm happy to say, it won't be my last. This quiet little restaurant is tucked away in a corner of a fairly quiet strip mall, but don't let that scare you off. Quiet is good when you're looking for a relaxing dinner for two, or for ladies who lunch. The Moo Shu pork was perfectly prepared, and plentiful and the service shines. Check out Ginger's yourself, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant has GREAT food! The Atmosphere here really quite- the take out is amazing- and fast. A must stop place to get food"}
{"text":"only 3 other guests at lunch time besides us.  Lettuce wraps disappointing, where's the ginger? Other items just OK.  Waiter very inattentive, hardly ever looked up from his phone.  Not a friendly place"}
{"text":"This place is great for a small, quiet dinner. The food is really good and they have good portions. My only complaint is that they need an additional waitress, sometimes I feel like I wait the entire meal for a refill on my drink. Other than that, it is a good place to dine at as long as you are not thirsty !"}
{"text":"This is great chinese food. The meat is not \"mystery meat\" and it is good clean food. I love the Mongolian Beef or they can substitute beef for chicken. Kinda on the pricey side, but good."}
{"text":"Ginger not bad... Service a little lack luster but food was perfecto! Menu didn't make you head spin to make a choice."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Ginger ever since it popped up in the neighborhood. We NorPho folks don't get a lot of one offs like Ginger up our way & it's a welcome change.  That said, Gingers contemporary style & menu options have been tasty every time I've stopped in or ordered out. The portions are decent & the pricing is just north of your standard Chinese fare. If the decor, menu options were more traditional, it wouldn't be worth your time. So be sure to stop in to this quiet little gem. The Crispy Citrus Mandarin Beef is just one of the reasons it's well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Today's Asian Pear salad had apples in it instead of pears with nobody telling you that. See my picture and you can guess how it taste.  Maybe the best meal they make is the Tofu Puffs,Todays vegetables were Broccoli, Bok Choy, Snow Peas, Carrots, and Mushrooms in an Ultra Mild thickened Chicken Broth. I couldn't taste any oil in this dish or much flavor but it did seem like fresh food.  I have been here many times with different diners because of location and I remember one person not liking a shrimp dish and another not liking a beef dish. I thought the Asian Pear Salad was a total loser today.  Most of the Asian restaurants in this immediate area are two stars to me  with them all being different also I wanted to retry in this area and also I didn't care to drive down Bell Road for a better option.  The thing that separates this two star Chinese from others nearby is that this place is sparkling clean,just look at the grout by the door."}
{"text":"I popped into Ginger the other night with a friend and it was all I thought it would be for a Chinese dinner.  I am really particular about my Chinese food because of all the horror stories I've heard as well as a few personal experiences.   We ordered two entrees, Chicken with cashews & snap peas accompanied with Garlic Chili Shrimp with Broadway noodles.  Both entrees were delicious! The food here was clean, you could see what ingredients were used, it tasted fresh and wasn't greasy.   There are a few Chinese restaurants in the area and Ginger Bistro is by far the best!    Its going to be my go to place whether I want to dine in or take-out."}
{"text":"I was nervous wreck the first time I ate at Ginger. Not because I was worried about getting dysentery (you know how those Chinese restaurants can be). But I was meeting friends of my manstress's parents for his father's birthday.   The place is great for groups, and they had us seated at a large table in the center of the room. I chose a seat at the end so I wouldn't be completely surrounded by people I didn't know. But all of my worries were put to rest since the whole crowd, like my parents, were teachers.   As the beverages began to flow, our table got louder and louder. No one seemed to mind, and the staff was very attentive.   All of the food was simply outstanding, and since we passed our dishes around for everyone to try I go to taste quite a few. I would highly recommend the both the sesame chicken and the spicy shrimp.   The delicious food paired with a great setting and staff really made this potentially awkward encounter much more comfortable."}
{"text":"As some previous reviewers have mentioned, Ginger China Bistro is reminiscent of the restaurant formerly known as Fate in downtown Phoenix.  I popped in for lunch this week as I was nearby due to GangplankNW http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Gangplanknw  To get my ginger party started, I ordered up a \"Ginger Palmer\" (ginger iced tea + lemonade). Man, what a unique and tasty beverage!  For my entry, I ordered up the \"Tofu puffs\" with seasonal vegetables dish, which comes with white rice. This dish (and probably all of them) come served in a generous amount of sauce. The food was tasty & filling. Ginger Bistro is a good spot for some flavorful, not so traditional Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service is very slow. Just walk in expecting it to be slow and you will have a great experience"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst chinese food my friends and I have ever had.  The food had no flavor at all and was soaked in oil.  I had to ask for extra chili just to add flavor to the food."}
{"text":"I've shared lunch with colleagues here and I have to say... not really impressed. The space is wonderful. Light, clean lines, uncramped, good flow - but I don't repeat visit a place that \"looks\" good. I simply don't have the time when there are so many places that bring me the whole package.   I don't know if there dinner menu is different, but there are a fair amount of selections without being overwhelming. There are only two meatless options, which I expect more of, especially in a Chinese restaurant. I've eaten ginger soy noodles and they are just bleh... if not a little greasy. Two of my friends seemed to enjoy their dishes and the fourth commented on hers being REALLY salty.   All of that could be forgiven if the flavor profile was strong enough to overcome the lack of creativity. But it just isn't.   For those of you looking for the \"all inclusive\" lunch special, keep driving. Here you will just get your entree item or app and a portion of white rice. They will bring you brown rice if you request and then remind them.   As it is a relatively small space, I would expect service to be attentive. And perhaps they have a different crew of people that work dinner, but we all sat with empty glasses grabbing employees as they walk by at arms length that seems oblivious to the fact that four people holding empty glasses is a sign that you might want to stop at the table.   Lastly, I sort of feel like GCB has a little bit of an identity crisis happening. It seems to want to the trendy go-to spot that pushes the tried and true Asian flavors to a new and updated level. Instead what it delivers is conventional, rather unremarkable food in really nice bowls.   Maybe we were just there on bad days. I get that. We all have them. But when you have other choices, I want some substance and wow."}
{"text":"very good food, share with a friend because the portions are big!!"}
{"text":"Come try this place , when I was there I had my doubts because there was not a lot of people but .... YUMMY !!! Lomein is my new favorite , there was only 1 server ( and I think he was the cook too ) but he was great ! I want to see this place full one day .."}
{"text":"I was excited to have lunch at what appeared to be a place that would offer a nice dining experience. Unfortunately I will never go back, as the meal was quite mediocre, the service/waitress failed at bringing life and personality. Overall I was surprisingly disappointed with the experience. \"Never judge a book by its cover,\" well, from the exterior this restaurant appeared to be nice and lively, but unfortunately it failed to measure up to the minimum level of expectations."}
{"text":"Very good! The Garlic Shrimp with Broadway Noodles was very tasty, even if they have a large amount of noodles. And their spring roll/crab angel appetizer was very tasty. Definitely looking forward to trying other dishes there!"}
{"text":"Very clean modern looking restaurant. We went at a slow time and the service was great and really fast.  The fried rice is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  We ordered the combo and it comes with 3 different meats chicken, pork and beef. It was some of the best fried rice I have ever had.   The portions are huge.   I ordered the sweet and sour crispy chicken, the crispy chicken was amazing, white meat and juicy inside. However the sauce was not my favorite, the chicken recipe had pineapple in it which I liked, but i could taste the pineapple juice in the sauce. It was more of a sweet recipe. It comes with white rice and there was not much contrast of flavor with the sweetness of the chicken.   I will come back and ask for the crispy chicken with a different sauce and the fried rice."}
{"text":"Just a disclaimer:  I don't usually seek out Chinese food, although I have enjoyed it on several occasions.  Ginger is conveniently located near one of my close friend's house so we decided that we'd check it out.  To be honest, the font that they use for their signage is totally fabulous and I love it- I know, the packaging always gets me!  I believe this follows through in the design of the restaurant as they are totally going for a modern look and it works for them.  We went on an evening when it wasn't too hot or too chilly and enjoyed the outdoor patio.  It is right next to the patio of the restaurant next door which seems like it would detract but it really didn't seem to.  The patio is small but comfortable.  Our server was attentive, and the service was up to par.  I enjoyed the garlic chill shrimp which was flavorful and a good portion size.  The presentation (once again) was impressive.  My companions enjoyed the strawberry, orange chicken salad and the combination lo mein.  Both seemed content with their meals.    The food was good, but lacked the umph to bring us back as we haven't revisited despite the convenient location.  The service was great.  Something I did enjoy is that Ginger is low to moderately priced- everything on the menu is under $10.  If you are into a more modern take on Chinese food in the area, I'd give Ginger a go."}
{"text":"Have never found a Chinese restaurant to compare with NYC.  That being said, this place was clean and uses linen napkins and that's a plus.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  True, the portions are quite large and easily shared.  The fried rice was okay as was the crispy chicken with mushroom sauce.  However, the server does not belong in a people oriented business.  He wasn't rude, but he wasn't pleasant.  Never checked to see if everything was alright  or did we need anything. There was a gigantic bag of fortune cookies off to the side, but we never got them.....guess that's why the bag is gigantic, they never give them out.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food and honestly going to a chain restaurant is not always something i want to do. My family and I love eating here usually we order our food to go but last night we decided to dine in. They give large portions like other reviews have stated so be ready to share.  I would highly recommended the wonton soup it has a nice flavorful broth with veggies noodles and wontons. We always get the combination fried rice and combination lo mein. Not a lot of veggies but it does have tons of meat and a good flavor. This time we also ordered the Beef and broccoli along with mandarin orange chicken both dishes were so good !  I really enjoyed the mandarin orange chicken it was overly sweet like most orange chickens you try at other places. The beef and broccoli was good the sauce that it was in was pretty awesome good flavor. Give this place a try it's better then other places in the area."}
{"text":"Passing through this side of Phoenix. We will make this a regular visit as we pass through again. Food was not to salty or too sweet like so many Chinese places are. Small menu. Seem to do the bit they do very well."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES this place!  The combination fried rice and noodles are awesome!  Other favorites are the sweet and sour pineapple chicken, honey sesame chicken, Mongolian beef, wok- seared onions, and the garlic chili shrimp-broadway noodles.  We have found with our MANY visits: this restaurant is always clean, has great service, is reasonably priced and most importantly has great tasting food! Don't believe the negative reviews; give this small neighborhood business a try for yourself!"}
{"text":"We have officially named this our new favorite  Chinese take out spot! So so good!  Not oily or heavy. Great prices for fantastic food!"}
{"text":"First of all, it is NOT an authentic Chinese food. (Think Panda Express)  We all ordered different items: mostly stir fried noodles. Despite the different names, they ALL tasted very similar. Mind you, if they were good, I wouldn't mind. But they were not flavorful at all, but very salty (Read: MSG / Hypertension). We had to ask a variety of sauces and even then the dishes turned out horrible. Not to brag, but I can definitely stir fry better noodles with fresher ingredients and better sauce mix at home. Coming from California and having tried hundreds of Chinese restaurants in that state, authentic or non-authentic, this restaurant is byfar the worst Chinese restaurant! Congrats on the Golden Raspberry Award.  In terms of decor, it is dimly lit, clean and modern, even fancy. Normally, I would save 2 stars for a restaurant regardless of their taste, but this restaurant is just beyond help - they desperately need to change their recipe or hire a new chef!  To be fair, other Chinese restaurants around the area are of similar quality, but slightly better. If overall it is an Arizonian thing, I would not know."}
{"text":"I am not getting the negative reviews, especially the one who claimed it wasn't \"authentic (think Panda Express).\"  The food is always fresh, the people are always friendly, and I always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"We ( my family) love this little family run treasure. Its around the corner from our house and the food is a gourmet step up from most Chinese restaurants.  We love love love it"}
{"text":"The food is super delicious service couldn't ask for better.... and the decor amazingly classy!"}
{"text":"I don't go anywhere else for Chinese food ever since deciding to give Ginger a try.  The food is always excellent (definitely try the Chicken Lo Mein!) and the service is fast. I don't know where the reviews about dirty dishes all over the place are coming from... It is always spotlessly clean in and the waitress is on top of keeping beverages filled and taking orders."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The food is consistently good the atmosphere is nice and the entire place is clean.  The server are pleasant, the food cost is reasonable and the monogolian beef is wonderful.  This place has the velveting down pat.  The Garlic shrimp with noodles is to die for.  They use fresh vegies and nothing is greasy.  We go there at least once every couple of weeks.  Very reasonable priced."}
{"text":"Okay food, super large portions, so prepare to share. We ordered the lettuce wraps (without meat and with Tofu) and they were pretty good, a bit heavy with the sauce but tasty.  For an entree we ordered the ginger noodles which were again okay, nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"There are so many Chinese restaurants out there to choose from and you never know which one to actually eat at.  This place however should be near the top of your list if in the area.  To many times have I been to a Chinese restaurant  where price is the main factor in luring patrons to walk in the door.  This is not the case here at Ginger China Bistro as it's not super cheap, but also not going to make a large dent in your wallet.  The food here is quite exceptional with its portion size, quality, and presentation.  Also the modern decor and contemporary look add to a pleasant experience in my opionion.  It also doesn't have that clutter factor like many other Chiniese restaurants so several bonus points earned for that.  I hope this place does well as it stands out from the rest."}
{"text":"I was visiting my parent's in Phoenix, and after getting off the plane from Reno, stopped by this place as my parent's enjoy it very much. I was excited to try a new place, as my parents are quite picking about places they like and usually right. Upon arrival to the parking lot I noticed little to no cars in the parking lot and thought it was strange, since it was 12:30PM Friday. My parent's said many people take it to go, Hmm....Ok??   We arrive and it's a nice looking place, but what is really strange is half the restaurant is set up for a large group. Most restaurants would put together all their tables on occasion but this place, puts 5 to 6 prime tables together 24/7, shutting down 1/2 of the restaurant in essence, another Hmm....Ok??  We sit at the freshly bussed table and the place probably needs another hand as Janet was our server, our busser, our cashier, pretty much everything except cook, although I didn't see her for a few moments, so maybe she does that too. She's not particularly brimming with excitement or emotion but she is efficient and happens to the make the whole thing work. I can't imagine anyone else running the show the way she does with no help. Hence maybe why it's a to-go place, because if it gets busy, you're screwed!   Luckily there were only a couple tables, so service would be okay today, we ordered 1 appetizer and 3 dishes.   App was Chicken Mushroom Lettuce Wraps - 5 Stars 1st Dish was Cashew Nut Chicken (CNC) - 3 Stars 2nd Dish Coconut Curry Chicken w/ Potato (CCCP) - a House Specialty - 2 Stars 3rd Dish and came out 5 minutes + after Dish 1 and 2 was Mu Shu Pork (MSP) 4 Stars - note this was 4 pre-rolled crepes  Analysis, first I asked for hot mustard which was really good, but for some reason they are very apprehensive about providing a big portion, I don't like to waste either, but it was a small amount, which I quickly blew through on my lettuce wraps. Same with the house made hot sauce, very small portion and no spoon to serve it. We had to ask for both again. When I got the hot mustard again, and not very timely re-up it was half of what I received the time before. Just strange to feel like they want to be stingy over something so trivial and essential to Chinese dining. It' s like getting a packet of soy sauce, when you want a bottle. I saw her serving the mustard from a squeeze mustard bottle; why not drop that on the table? It would make for a great impression and be something you would never forget!   The Lettuce Wrap was not really wraps, but a large piece of romaine that really made a great way to serve the marinated chicken and mushrooms. Then adding the hot sauce and hot mustard, made it 5 stars. I was really excited to be blown away by what was coming next.   The CNC is usually my favorite and this version was severely lacking cashew nuts. I think there was 7-8 of them, and this wasn't a lunch special, this was an entree. We shared all the dishes and maybe got 2 or 3 each. The chicken was not especially great, after having marinated and delicious wraps, it reminded me of boiled or chicken in hot water, which was thrown into a wok with the other ingredients at the end. It just was lacking depth, flavor, etc. I will say it was abundant, but Chinese food is all about flavor and balance, and you need the perfect amount of chicken, nut and vegetables to round it out to complete, and it just missed.   The CCCP was the same chicken style so no need to beat a dead horse, the curry reminded me a Japanese curry I had (not my favorite either), but I couldn't taste any coconut. ZERO. If they was coconut or coconut milk in there I would be shocked. It was a lot of curry, lots of chicken, no coconut milk, and maybe 1 ounce of potatoes, again flavors off, and no balance.   Last was the MSP, it was the best of the dishes, but my gripe is I don't like it pre-rolled, I have never had it this way, and the reason I don't like it pre-rolled, is I can't make my perfect crepe, and then add the hot sauce and the plum sauce. It was good but it also wasn't a ton of food. I think they serve it this way to give the appearance of more when you are getting less. I would rather have a plate of Mu Shu Pork w/ 4 crepes on the side and make it myself.   Again as before, very STINGY on the PLUM sauce, this time there was a spoon, but maybe a tablespoon of the sauce. I just don't get it. Sauce is the FINISHING MAGIC, SO ask people HOW MUCH is ENOUGH?! I would have asked for more but again Janet is doing everything there, and sometimes, you just want to eat and get a move on.   Overall, it EASILY could be a 5 star place with some tweaks, many aforementioned here, but for today 3 stars is all I can muster for an okay experience!"}
{"text":"We love Ginger! Tonight we tried the egg foo  young. It is well worth the 20 minute drive! Great service and food!"}
{"text":"I was pretty underwhelmed by Ginger :( I ordered the Garlic Chili Shrimp with 'broadway noodle' for take out, and it was literally egg noodles with zero sauce, and boiled shrimp with Sambal chili sauce smeared on top. No veggies, no delectable garlic chili sauce. I could have made something better at home. I would highly suggest asking about the dish you are interested in, as there are no descriptions at all on the online menu. If we ever order again, I will try something else after asking for dish details."}
{"text":"I am surprised that they have good reviews.  I would say this was my least favorite chinese restuarant in town.  I am trying to think postiviely after reading some of 5 star reviews, but  I cannot forget how orange chiken tasted like a sugar chiken.  I almost thought I was eating a dessert.   I don't mind modern, dark, quiet atmosphere as long as the chinese food tastes like chinese food."}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant! We come here religiously for their amazing food! Everything is delicious from their contemporary takes on classics to the go-to traditional dishes. The family that runs Ginger is so kind and attentive. The service is fantastic and consistent. We will continue visiting and making memories here (:"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  The food is great and the prices are reasonable...too bad they do not have the best signage.  My wife and I have been there twice since we discovered it about a month ago.  The orange chicken is amazing!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm....tasty!  We ordered the Moo Shu Pork Crepes and some other pork dish and loved the flavor.  We also ordered the Tofu Puffs with veggies on a recommendation, but thought it was quite bland.   We were shocked that the restaurant was completely empty on a Saturday evening since we enjoyed the food.  The restaurant is very clean and well kept with friendly and prompt service.  The downside was the price."}
{"text":"Really a 2+ After looking for a new chinese restaraunt to try, we went as a family with grandma on a Friday evening. Overall, everyone REALLY liked the food. The only shortcoming was the service......very flat affect and low talkers."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop Chinese with great food.   I bet they sell a lot of take out.   But you never have to wait for a table.  Every time we go we order the pear salad but ADD chicken for $3.  The dressing is wonderful and it can feed four.   It is so refreshing and tasty.   Tonight we added some Lettuce wraps and that was our dinner.   Won ton soup for $5.95 can easily feed two.   You will love everything on the menu.   Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Started off with high hopes, given the other reviews.  Service simply sucked.  Dirty dishes everywhere.  Waitress was alone and had no interest in taking our order.  My entree came out at least ten minutes before my companion's food.  Food was okay but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This is a good spot. Family run business, excellent service and great food. We had the crab angels, spring rolls lo mein, orange chicken, and fried rice. Food was good and we definitely would come back."}
{"text":"To begin with, I was already skeptical to give this place a try due to its overall rating of 3.5. But I saw the most recent reviews of the place were positive so I ended up giving in. Boy did I seriously get honey potted badddd. When I walked in there was a table of two sitting and that was it.. I stood there for a few minutes and the host/ was slouched on the chair watching the basketball game completely oblivious to his entire surroundings. It wasn't until I made a noise that the waiter finally noticed.. Sad.. I ordered the wonton soup noodle and crispy chicken with mushroom sauce. Terrible terrible TERRIBLE! The wonton soup was a large portion but whats the point of having it so huge when it taste like dog shit. The crispy chicken was even worse.. the crispy chicken was not crispy at all rather it more like mushy chicken.. the sauce had no other flavor aside from pure salt. I ate about 1/4 of the food and I had to ask for the bill.. the best thing was the ice cold water to cool myself down after this horrible experience. I did not pack any of the food to-go because I don't even think my dog at home would want to eat that shit."}
{"text":"Gingers is a very good place to get  non-greasy chinese food. I have been there 4 times, There is usually only one waitress. Which makes sense cause there not very busy. Food is always out within 10 min of ordering. All rice is good. Seasame chicken and orange chicken is really good. egg rolls and crab angels are decent. Best olace.withing 15 miles for chinese food."}
{"text":"We love the honey sesame chicken, mongolian beef and pork fried rice.  The interior is more modern than most Chinese restaurants, and very nice.  There's a patio if you'd like to eat outside, as well.  This is our go-to place for takeout...it's the best in the area."}
{"text":"Ginger used to be a go to spot for me, but has faded.  The dishes are not balanced in my opinion; not enough vegetables, too much rice.  The service is perfunctory and you don't get anything unless you asked.  Does not seem like a happy place."}
