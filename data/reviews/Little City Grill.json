{"text":"If you have never been here before you'd probably like it fine.  But as a local I can attest that this place was better as the little neighborhood bar, \"Digger's\".  You could get breakfast all day.  

Not under Bert.  Not only do they stop serving breakfast, but at different times during the week.  Weekdays are different from weekends.  Sunday is different from Saturday.  Who can remember?  Who will care?  After you walk over for breakfast a few times only to have Bert turn you away like a child coming tardy to class (were you once a teacher, Burt?) you just want to say \"eff this.\"

Once we even got there before their published time, expecting breakfast, only to have the cook say no, we're doing catering today, kitchen's busy.  Honestly, wut.

That wasn't even the worst time.  That would be when, after walking over, I was told no breakfast.  I said \"fine, now I have to go to another restaurant for breakfast.\"  Burt said cheerfully \"don't choke.\"  

Honestly, Bert, the logistics of serving breakfast aren't that hard.  You've been sold a bill of goods by your kitchen staff.  They need to do their jobs or get fired.   Is this Bert's first restaurant?

Either way, I don't think he wants neighborhood business.  My gf had her own similar unpleasant experiences."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  There is a regular crowd; however, the service was very welcoming. Great chocolate martinis and steak dinner!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome came to Kent visiting my daughter at the college for her birthday all the food was absolutely fantastic service was terrific and we just had an all in all great time we give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a rainy morning breakfast.   I'm torn on this place,  food was good but some portions were small and the service was less than desirable.   I got the cranberry walnut French toast with a side of bacon and coffee.   Food was good and the portion was decent,  never got a single warm up on my coffee though.   My date had the corned beef hash which  was good but pretty small,  the server asked him what type of toast he wanted but then never brought him toast,  when he asked about it he was told \"oh sorry,  it doesn't come with toast\".  Mistakes are made but she should have come and told him that,  or brought the toast that SHE initially asked about.   He also have to ask twice for his coke before she finally brought  it (after the food was delivered).   We will probably give it another try because the food was good...  But someone's needs to re-train the waite staff."}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner at Little City Grill this Wednesday night. It's their \"bistro night\" and the chef creates some specials. I had the seabass with an orange sauce, roasted broccoli, and a nice salad. It was served elegantly - as in a more upscale restaurant. We tried the tuxedo cheesecake for dessert. The server was friendly.The service was perfect. We will be back."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly owner and service!  Our favorite Kent restaurant outside of downtown."}
{"text":"Good and fast service. Love their hash. The portion size is a little small though and the parking lot is not paved. A little worried about my tires lol.
Conveniently located."}
{"text":"Such a great little diner. Bert and his staff are friendly and fun, and the food is awesome. They have the biggest pancakes I've ever seen. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great Local Business serving delicious traditional Diner Style Food.  My favorite is the Breakfast Greek Wrap.  I haven't been able to try any other breakfast because I can't stop ordering the Greek Wrap.  Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner - Little City is sure to please."}
{"text":"Great food & service is wonderful. The owner is out of this world! Highly recommend. Fabulous catering as well. So glad we have a great place to eat & hang out."}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon deal. Went in Saturday night prime rib night. Service was fast. Waitress was exceptional. Food was good. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Bartender suggested I try their Curteous Burger (made w/beef/pork/lamb) with bacon on top, it was fantastic, full of flavor, sided with housemade potato chips (they were good)! Bartender waited my table and did an exceptional job keeping my drink refilled and letting my know my food was almost ready. Hats off to the cook!"}
{"text":"Groupon Lunch for 2 visit:

password protected wifi is available... the password is not on the menu or tablecards

Chili - sweet turkey and bean... really is sweet... no real sharp chili powder taste.

African Peanut Soup - large pieces of tomato with onion in a peanut broth

Chicken Philly - sans mushrooms... must grilled chicken... supper sloppy... bun started to wilt from runny cheese sauce... extra napkins a must

Aloha Wrap - more ham than chicken... honey mustard with pineapple was a nice combo

Tater tots did not have extra salt... plenty left to take home... bonus points for having biodegradable takeout fold-paks... rare in this area.

After Groupon. .. $11 ... will come again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious! They give American favorites and sandwiches a twist!!! All made in house and smoked out back!! Staff and owners are so friendly and helpful!  Best in town!!"}
{"text":"A nice little place, and we lucked out with an entertainer playing guitar and singing. The food wasn't the greatest. Our order was the sirloin steak w/baked potato and broccoli, and chicken picatta. The potato was downright horrible, the steak had nothing desirable to mention, broccoli pretty raw. The chicken was fair but over powered by way too much capers, and lemon juice. No hint of wine and salty. Otherwise I liked the place good atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Little City Grill is a quaint eating hole located close to downtown Kent, Ohio. Awesome breakfast, low prices, creative wraps, and entrees. The service is really nice and attentive. It's a great little restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"Five stars for being about the only place open at 6:30am on a Sunday morning, and only open for breakfast on Sunday. There were people trickling in early, and we were able to just pick a booth and sit down. Parking is in rear with a small rock driveway. Has front & rear entrances, and you walk through a hallway in the rear. They seem to have a busy night life too with a few bar stool seats. The Goat Cheese wrap was good and a little twist on breakfast, liked the mushrooms. Waitress was friendly, and let me order hashbrowns instead of fruit with the plate. It's small but busy. l'll have to try again, and maybe later in the day too."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! And hands down the best veggie burger in town! It is made in house with their own recipe and has a delicious mildly spicy honey mustard on it that tops it off and adds that extra layer of flavor. As a vegetarian I've had my fair share of smushy patties, but this one takes the prize for texture and flavor. The fries are also very good. They have some sort of flavored salt on them that makes them so good I don't even use ketchup."}
{"text":"I think this place used to be called Digger's. Went here on a Friday night and enjoyed the fish special. I got the baked fish, my friend got the fried and we split. I thought the baked was better, but the fried was good as well. Nothing special or fancy, just a simple little restaurant/bar in Kent where one can go for a cheap decent meal. For one meal the bill was under $10 which is something I hardly see anymore up in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody who is looking for a great breakfast. The server/bartender recommend the Sausage Skillet and it was fantastic. The sausage gravy is homemade and delicious. It's rare that I can't finish a meal, but I met my match today. The prices are also very good; so if you're on a budget, you can still fill up. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot of beers on tap, four to be exact. Also, there's only one cook so the food takes forever. My food was alright but my wife's prime rib, which was the days special, was nothing but a very expensive piece of gristle. if you're looking for a good meal at a fair price, I'd keep looking."}
{"text":"I got a mac and cheese burger and him cut fries. They were so good. I wish I had another burger after I finished that one"}
{"text":"I feel like Little City Grill is a bit underrated. It's become my wife and I's go to \"spot\". We've been here about 5 times and love it every time. The servers are so awesome. We've had good luck each instance we've been here. (**Update: this last visit, there was only one waitress on a Saturday night. As in, one person to tend bar, take orders, bring orders out, clean tables, and seat people. It was ridiculous. The place was packed. She worked her butt off, but obviously only one person can do so much. She literally had to run the entire time, and was out of breath taking orders. I felt guilty asking for anything. If it was my first visit, I probably would have given 1 or 2 Stars, but luckily they have a cache built up with me, and I know stuff happens**)


It's not quite a dive, but certainly not fancy. Some of the food is pretty high end for the type of place that it is though. I mean, they have their pub food, but also some pretty legit entrees. I feel like they have an actual chef, not just some 17 year old high school kid reheating dishes in a microwave in the back. 

There is a Groupon available if that's your thing. We've used it and it's saved a few dollars. We paid $12 for $20 worth of food. But can only be used for lunch and dinner.

-The chicken parm meal is one of my favorites. Big portion of chicken, a nice sized side salad and 2 pieces of garlic bread and is less than $11. The sauce is a little more watery than I like, but the chicken is fantastic. 

-Their salads are awesome too! They're humongous, and I mean humungous, like a large mixing bowl size, and you get garlic bread as a side. The grilled chicken Nelson salad with mandarin oranges and cranberry is fantastic. I'd be happy with it at a swanky $25 an entree type place.  The best part: NO ICEBERG. It's artisanal lettuce and spinach, the way it should be. 

-I also really liked the fish dinner. Good portion and tasty. 

-If you order the hummus chicken wrap, I recommend asking to add chicken. Just a small up-charge and it's really good. My wife loves it so much she gets it every time. She always goes in wanting to try something else, but just can't get over the idea of skipping an opportunity to eat the hummus chicken wrap. 

-The Buffalo Chicken sandwich is very large and comes with blue cheese crumbles and tastes excellent.

-They have a gourmet burger that uses ground brisket, chuck and sirloin. Comes on a really good toasted bun.

-Steak wasn't bad. 8 oz sirloin, tasty side salad, baked potato and veggies for $14 is a good deal. 

-For Breakfast- My wife's omelette was very good, and the toast they give you is on awesome bread. My sausage biscuits and gravy were the best I've ever had, and it's what I always get for breakfast. There was pieces of bacon in them too, fantastic. Our server was really good and attentive. 

- I love the rooster sauce, it's sriracha and ranch. It comes with the tots. I ask for it when I get fries now too. I recommend you do the same! 

-The Long Island Ice Tea rivals Ray's Place."}
{"text":"First time here... went in for lunch ,, the food was really good. I had the Brunswick Stew and it was seriously yummy !! My boyfriend had the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich which I tasted and it was delicious ...  he also enjoyed it !! Going to try their breakfast next ..."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch on a Saturday!
Food was pretty good, I would go back for that. My only complaint was it was dead silent in there. My husband and I felt like we couldn't talk to one another. I imagine every other table in there felt that way, because no one was talking! I saw they had TVs , maybe those could have been on or a radio of some sort! The silence made it akward!"}
{"text":"enjoyed the meals i have had from a burger to ribs.  the ribs were fabulous.  fries are great.  service was very good and friendly.  a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this past Sunday. This place tries so hard not to be its former incarnation (Diggers) but goes horribly wrong in doing that.

Tries very hard to be an upscale bistro. It isn't.

Ordered a Philly cheesesteak omelette and sausage gravy and biscuits. For the most part, a mistake.

Omelette was edible, but was served \"skillet\" style on top of what was supposed to be hand cut fried potatoes. Potatoes were burnt but under cooked & raw. How does one achieve that?

Biscuits and gravy was horrid. Apparently the \"chef\" thinks seasoning a pork product with another pork product is the way to go. I could not taste sausage OR gravy, but had an overwhelming taste of bacon. I love bacon, just not when I want sausage. And it doesn't work in a gravy at all. Took one bite and left the remaining on the plate.

Both dishes were served with an orange slice as garnish. Who in the world puts sweet as a garnish for what's supposed to be savory?

Waitress was nice and attentive. She asked how it was and seemed concerned when I voiced my dissatisfaction with the meal. Knowing how restaurants and owners do not service their customers nowadays, I told the waitress to not worry about it, as I knew nothing satisfactory would be done by the owner or manager (who was more concerned with looming about the bar and yucking it up with a pair college students drinking at the bar to obviously top off the previous night's heavy drinking). 

Bring back Diggers. This place just doesn't cut the mustard."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a Saturday luncheon.

If memory serves, and it does so begrudgingly, in an earlier incarnation, this was basically a neighborhood bar that served food. 

For the discerning crowd, it is now a neighborhood restaurant that serves alcohol.

My wife got a cheeseburger and hand-cut fries, I got a turkey Ruben and onion rings.  There was no mention of hands regarding the rings, so I just don't know!

As the iced tea is fountain, not brewed, we both opted for a soda.

The turkey Ruben was made with shaved turkey breast from a turkey breast log, not turkey pastrami, it did however have the requisite sauerkraut, and thousand island dressing. 
It was served deli-style, (piled high in the center devoid of filling around the perimeter.) 
I'm not a huge fan of this method.  It suggests that I'm too stupid to figure out that there really isn't all that much meat in the sandwich, and if I just want a finger sandwich, that's what I'll order, otherwise give me what I order!  
It did taste good as did everything we were served.

The waitress had apparently been subject to a very long day, as I heard her defiantly ask if the 6 folks at the next table were sure they didn't want anything else, after complying with the handful of requests they had made upon being served.

My momma told me to never tell someone they looked as though they had a long day, etc. but rather that they acted as though it had been a long day, or it seemed as if it had been a long day.  Essentially saying someone looks like hell or seems bitchy usually doesn't rest too well!
Happily she took my inquiry as intended.... an opening to vent a bit and maybe recover a bit of her composure.
It worked quite nicely, and had I asked we might have even become \"Facebook Friends\", but since I don't have any of those,and didn't especially want to start checking my \"Home page\", I didn't ask!

Apparently the root cause of the mood was the absence of a dishwasher, and the resultant absence of clean anything with which to serve folks.
After careful examination of our tableware, and finding nothing objectionable as a result, I was appropriately empathetic, gave her a nice tip and wished her a better afternoon, and a great evening and off we went!"}
{"text":"Friendly owner. Since this was our first time to Kent so he chatted with us. Enjoyed the quaint bar/restaurant atmosphere. TV. Booths and tables. Enjoyed the Saturday special--prime rib with broccoli and baked potato. Very good. Veggie bean burger was good with the cilantro honey mustard sauce. The steak salad was good and plentiful. Coffee and iced tea were fresh. This is the place to meet up with friends or go by yourself for a reasonably priced meal. May become our go-to place when we sightsee Kent and campus."}
