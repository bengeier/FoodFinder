{"text":"This is such a wonderful local surprise. In the heart of a small downtown is this amazing soul kitchen with seriously amazing food and wonderful service. We had a group of five with orders all over the map and they didn't skip a beat. Get the deluxe margarita - you never know what they'll garnish it with. For us it was fried chicken and a cheeseburger! Too fun."}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance. You feel like you're not in downtown Rantoul! From the welcoming fireplace, to the comfortable sitting, to the aroma of great food and coffee, it's a great place to be. I love their baked potato soup and their turkey sandwich with spicy bacon is delish. I'm so glad this exists in a town where everything is chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"We frequent here for Sunday brunch, and it is always amazing. Sometimes there are slight inconsistencies in what you get or how you get it, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Java Connection is a beautiful coffee shop. C&C Kitchen joined in to bring downtown Rantoul wonderful food. Just had the Catfish Po'boy, blackened - Yay Chef Curtis!  Superyummy. Seriously."}
{"text":"Found this gem by accident on a motorcycle trip with friends. It a little spot in downtown area and can't say enough good about it . Our waiter Kristian was very friendly and welcoming. The food was awesome and good portions and not priced bad at all . If you driving thru Rantoul IL. it's a great spot to grab a bite"}
{"text":"Chef driven, southern inspired, and well executed. C&C Kitchen does not disappoint on the culinary side. Space is clean, contemporary, and welcomes a diverse crowd.   Call ahead seating for a group of 18 was seamless. Service was pleasant, attentive, and efficient, even with just one server for our large group. Food came out quickly after orders were taken.  Normally I go for the chicken or catfish po' boy, but ordered the fish and grits on my most recent visit. This turned out to be a good choice.   The fish was well seasoned and crispy. Chef Curtis finishes the fried fish (and chicken) with a house blended seasoning that takes the flavor to another level. Pro tip: Ask for a serving of remoulade sauce on the side and use it generously on the fish.   The grits are served atop/within a rich and flavorful gumbo, and garnished with sautéed kale. Grits were creamy, savory, and very well executed. The gumbo served with the grits is a nice touch, and again adds another layer of flavor to already well seasoned food.   Portion size was adequate and left me very much satisfied.  If you're looking for real food, made fresh, and with real ingredients, C&C Kitchen is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great HOMEMADE COOK TO ORDER FRESH FOOD! If you want great food you pay a bit more!  It is worth it! My husband is not a fish eater and orders a catfish fillet with his meal every time! They have great brunch on Sundays also!"}
{"text":"Get the captain crunch french toast stuffed with strawberry cream cheese. Add the jalapeño bacon and thank me later. Goat Cheese and Dates sandwich, yes.  Coolest place in the area... Looks like it belongs in NYC."}
{"text":"Very comfortable and clean, I really enjoyed my meal of catfish, greens, slaw, and red beans n rice. Staff was very good, food came out fast. I live in champaign and don't hit Rantoul very often for food. I'm happy I did!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try this place. I was really impressed. Not very big and nice small menu. I would classify it as southern type comfort food. I had to try the the fried Alligator po boy. It was delicious. The colslaw that was on top was amazing. I do not like colslaw until I ate that. My wife had the catfish po-boy. She said it was the best fish sandwich she had ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. It was very flakey. I'm was very friendly and could see the passion he has for his food. I highly recommend this place.  Prices are a little on high end. But again you get what you pay.  The service was great. We did not have to wait long for the food. The owner keeps the kitchen staff moving. I strongly encourage you give this place a try. I want to see a small business succed."}
{"text":"Two stops here and I am a big fan. Hot breakfast cooked up and served by people who care. (Nope not by your parents) It's the little things. You want a latte they will ask hot/cold, whole milk, flavor, any thing you want. The place is spotless! Nice people. The Rantoul old downtown gains a little more polish with the help of Java Connection. Support these locals! They deserve it!!"}
{"text":"The owner was nice and Chef Curtis was friendly; he served a great breakfast. I was hoping to hear more about the coffee selections from the owner, but instead she just directed me to the house roast, which was not good. I would have paid more money for a better selection. But, she seemed too busy with the other four patrons to discuss them with me.   The negative: Chef Curtis' wife was not sociable and should not be working directly with customers at the register! When I went to pay my bill, she never greeted me, gave me eye contact, nor thanked me for coming. She just took my money and walked away! She never opened her mouth. This was my first visit. Not a good impression. But, again, the food may bring me back to the restaurant for a second visit. If the customer service was better, I would have rated 5 stars.   Tip: Chef get a second phone for your business so you won't have to answer the phone with \"hello\"! I thought I had the wrong number when calling the restaurant :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped by to warm up with coffee and decided to try the chili and gumbo--everything was excellent! We'll definitely be back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared food (similar to a Panera) and coffee in a refreshing atmosphere.  Surprisingly large menu with lots of options - creative hot and cold sandwiches, soups and salads - always a good pick for lunch in Rantoul.  Only downside is they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Far and away the best food I've had in Central Illinois. A deep and truly impressive menu with southern/creole inspiration. Highlights of today's brunch - the very best grits I have ever eaten. Seriously so good. My husband got a breakfast sandwich on a homemade cheddar biscuit that was incredibly light and fluffy. Oh! And don't miss out on the huge beignets. On site roasted coffee is also delish. Not a single miss! We can't wait to make it back and try the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Chef Curtis always serves up great comfort food at great prices. You haven't lived until you've had the catfish Po'Boy and gumbo.  He took over the building from Java Connection this spring and hasn't served coffee since."}
{"text":"You will be shocked that this is in downtown Rantoul. It looks like it should be in or near a larger city. This is primarily a WiFi coffee cafe but don't let that fool you. If your a foodie, you will love this place. You must try the soups. The roasted red pepper and sausage soup is to die for. Oh and the potato soup is every bit as good. Cozy seating on two floors. On chilli days, you can set in a comfy couch or easy chair near the fireplace and watch the pedestrians and cars go by on the main downtown street."}
{"text":"Out of a few items (baked potato, burgers). Meals or group of 9 had were good. Will come again."}
{"text":"Please update Yelp, Your website, Your Facebook Page or leave your hours on your business voicemail so people looking for a coffee shop know your closed on Saturdays..   Website says 5PM Saturday's, Yelp/FB says 3PM and the phone rings until Jesus returns. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"We're from New York passing thru for a football game in Champaign. Found this gem for a late breakfast. Four of us were fed enough food for 8 people. Huge portions. Delicious southern cooking. I had the Shrimp and Grits with gumbo and French toast. So good!  The staff was the best, warm, friendly, helpful. Faster service than you get in the south."}
{"text":"My first experience dining was today- food was outstanding-the gumbo, shrimp and grits, corn bread and fried chicken salad were delicious.    The waffles/fried chicken, catfish, red beans and rice, succotash, and home fries all looked delicious (sparking some sadness and wondering \"can I change my order?\"  The restaurant was clean, bright, nicely decorated- a very welcome addition to downtown Rantoul.  Only downside was the wait- I think it's a good problem to have a long (30 min) wait for table, as it shows it's extremely popular.  Server/staff were friendly/helpful.  Food was definitely worth the wait, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Hours online says 8am-8pm. Door says kitchen is open 8-2 then closes til 430 and reopens from 430-730. What kind of mess is this? Arrived at 2:05, didn't even bother going in."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The chili is spicy and I loved it! I wish there was more of a variety of coffee. It is called the Java connection after all. Only one time that I went in has there been more then the basic 3 coffees that I get myself. I think McDonald's has more of a variety of coffee. I was hoping to finally have a great place to eat and have great coffee. If they got a barista I would go there all the time."}
{"text":"Bottomless coffee is always worth five stars; however, there is much more to the Java connection than coffee. The beautiful decor, live fireplace, old world charm, delicious pastries, clean bathrooms, lotion in the ladies room, free wifi, and friendly staff are just an addition to the purpose of this place. What a wonderful and welcoming place for meetings, fellowship, and nourishment of many kinds. Go see for yourself. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We heard many good reviews of this small place and decided to try it out. The food was excellent, though a bit pricey for our town. The menu is definitely on the Cajun side, which is not my favorite, but three in our party of 6 tried Cajun dishes--Jambalaya, and Shrimp and Grits, and they raved about it. I had the Chili which was excellent Both Teens had Waffles-I think they were called Banana's Foster Waffles, but I am not sure, they approved.  My only criticism is  the waitress was hap hazard about attending our table, so maybe more than one on a Saturday also the decor, which in itself is fine, but as we came in the front of the place seemed to have an empty fridge or some equipment sitting there, Also Oddly shaped glassed in room by bar. With a bit of a face lift this place would look as good as the food tastes Would definitely go back and must say C & C Kitchen is a great addition to Rantoul!!"}
{"text":"Great people and even better food. Unique and unsuspecting items on the menu. Super nice chef ... Great environment. My new sanctuary."}
{"text":"C&C Kitchen is the quintessential American success story of a man who pulled himself up by his own bootstraps through hard work and a sense of great food and customer service. Chef Curtis has created a wonderful eatery that consistently produces high quality food and is a bright spot for the evolving scene in downtown Rantoul.  The menu is inspired by Southern favorites and each dish is freshly prepared from scratch. Portions are generous and affordably priced. My favorite dish is the catfish platter, served with your choice of red beans and rice or fries, and a side of cole slaw and cornbread. The breaded version is feather light with a judicious sprinkling of cayenne to give it just the right kick, and the fish is cooked to a tender and moist perfection that just melts in your mouth. Blackened salmon was also cooked nicely and served with yellow rice and char-grilled asparagus. The shrimp po'boy sandwich is highly recommended as is the gumbo and chili. I've sampled the chicken wings, also cooked with the spicy breading, and they are quite wonderful too. They have me thinking about trying the chicken and waffles on my next visit. I've also enjoyed the pineapple upside-down cake, cooked in its own tin.  The cake was flavorful and rich and the fruit at the bottom had caramelized in places to create delightful strands of candied fruit and sugar.  Service is prompt and friendly, although I understand that the weekend brunches often draw a crowd so you may have to wait for a table. It's well worth a trip but beware-you may find yourself becoming addicted to this wonderful cafe."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time I just paid $21 for two cheeseburgers that were the driest things I've ever seen in my life on the menu it said plus all the fixin's which led me to believe that you would at least get lettuce tomato and onion but no all you got was a dry Burger I drive on in a couple of fries for $10 a piece this is outrageous it will never happen again"}
{"text":"We were on our way for Thai but when we saw C & C sign we quickly changed our mind, and so glad we did . We will most definitely return and will recommend to others as well. Good Food C & C Kitchen!"}
{"text":"We highly recommend ordering the yard bird sandwich and the sweet corn and crab bisque. Both were delicious! We also ordered the brisket sandwich with mac n cheese which was also a good option. The building is very clean and well decorated. Also loved the open concept kitchen and seeing them cook your food fresh. The staff was nice and very helpful. Its a great addition to the area. Cant wait to come back for ribs, gator, gumbo, or breakfast."}
{"text":"We stopped here while driving from Chicago to Memphis. Seriously the BEST catfish I've ever had! Delicious food, very clean and friendly people, I don't think you can ask for more!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in the Champaign Urbana area. The chef is extremely talented. His take on southern American classics rarely disappoints. You can never go wrong with the chicken and waffles, but do not cheat yourself and stick to one entree. Try the entire menu. The flavor consistently bold and not too salty. The icing on the cake is the service. They're always very attentive and are quick to correct any mistakes they make."}
{"text":"I had no clue about having such a great restaurant in Normal. Great food!!!!!!!!! I met the owner and I gotta say he has some great ideas. He is funny as hell. I really did like this place and I am sure I will revisit here."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive from CU (c'mon, it's only 15 minutes!). My partner went to C & C for for a laaaaate Saturday brunch. We wanted to get the shrimp and grits, but they were, sadly, out of that item (you get what you get when you show up at 2 PM looking for brunch). Instead, we got a Catfish Plate with Greens and a Haystack. While everything was great, the Catfish Plate was the standout. The fish was lightly battered in cornmeal and perfectly deep fried. The exterior was crunchy, a little bit chewy, not at all oily, and dusted with a creole seasoning. The interior was moist and tender. Just perfect. The greens on the side (a $2 upcharge, definitely worth it) were also top notch - a great big bowl of them.  The service was prompt and friendly. The prices were totally reasonable. The space was clean and comfortable. We'll definitely be back (earlier in the day, so we can get the shrimp and grits)."}
