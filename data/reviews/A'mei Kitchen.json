{"text":"Good deals for congee and snack for $6.50.   I got the beef congee which was tasty but not too salty by default, which I liked. The rice noodle rolls were a kind of stiff. They didn't have soy sauce for my rice noodles either - just sesame sauce and the sweet sauce. When I asked for soy sauce, they seemed reluctant to give it to me, but still gave it to me anyway."}
{"text":"Had the spicy noodle soup, hainan chicken rice.  Excellent service.  Noodle soup was $8, I think.  Good portion.  Spicy noodle was not too spicy, noodle had good bite.    Nice alternative to Bai Potatoe Noodle and Sun Noodle in the same food court.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"Got seafood fried rice with garlic. After I paid it was 50 cents more than it was listed. I know it's only 50 cents...but sucks that this rude angry lady ripped me off. Food is bland and took for ever to come out."}
{"text":"Obviously i never eaten hainam chicken rice with white rice before. If they doesn't have it just say it. This is not a hainam chicken rice!"}
{"text":"Food court style Chinese food.  Variety of rice and soup noodle dish.  Had the wan Tom noodle soup.  Broth is tasty, wan ton home made style, firm thin noodles served in nice bowls from china, chop sticks, tooth picks and big spoon for broth.  Will be a strong competitor in food court."}
