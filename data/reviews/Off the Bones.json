{"text":"On our way back to the city, we decided to go to Pickering for some food. Even though it would set us back, time-wise, after reading reviews for Off the Bones we decided it would be worth it.

Very excited to have some BBQ we arrived at the plaza at 9:27pm only to see that it was closed. I verified on yelp which stated the place was open and then walked over to the sign on the front of the restaurant to read that it was open until 12am. 

No lights on and doors were locked, yet a large banner that could be see on Brock road headed towards the plaza stating that it was open. 

We are very disappointed to have gone out of our way to stop here only to see that it was closed. We will not be making a stop here again.

This is unfortunate because I'm sure the food is as good as people have said, the only thing is that you have to catch them on their schedule and when they decide to open."}
{"text":"I came here with the family had the half- rack, The Dirty South sandwich and a kids rib meal the food was quick it was extremely good. The meat was tender you taste the smoke the cook was great and the service was also excellent"}
{"text":"Finally a halal bbq joint  Really enjoyed the Ribs, chicken wings and the corn bread. Chipotle bbq sauce was wicked! I had Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes which were both great.  Overall service was good.

Side note:  gravy could've been better

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am not usually in the Pickering area, so when I was there on Tuesday, I decided to pick up dinner. I called in and ordered the BBQ Feast, which came out to $67 with tax, which is ok for 4. I was really excited to try it. 

Walked in after 20 mins, it was empty (Tuesday 8 pm), which makes sense during Ramadan and the location. I paid, waited 5 mins, picked up my order. It was a large paper bag with 3 large take out containers and two small for the sides. Seems about right. 

Drove 25 minutes home, opened the containers and I was missing the brisket and chicken. (!?!?!) The containers were half empty, so the brisket and chicken could have easily been packed in there. I am not at all impressed considering the staff were not at all busy and not packing about 50% for the order is unacceptable. Especially as a new business. 

I called them and the person on the phone was courteous and took my name and number down so I can pick up the missing items next time I go. Which is nice - but I have NO idea when I will be there next. 

The food... I've had my share of southern BBQ, so I'd like to think I know what I am talking about here.. 
Fries - Good. Nothing special
Beans - Fine, a little too sweet for my taste. But fine
Ribs - Good, tender. Got the wrong sauce. Ordered the OTB Hot sauce, but it was smothered in something sweet. 
Chicken wings - Kinda dry... OTB hot sauce is good. A little mild for \"hot sauce\". 
Brisket - no idea!
Roast chicken - no idea!

I'd love to go back and update this review. This place has the potential, but the staff definitely needs more training."}
{"text":"We visited Off the Bones last weekend to pick up some ribs for dinner and though we were there during the business hour, the store was closed.  We peaked inside to see if there was anyone in the store and there was no sign of anyone.  

Then we noticed the health inspection notice on the front window with a conditional pass which must have been why the store was closed during their normal business hours.  

Since this place is relatively new, it's alarming that it received a conditional pass.  Not sure if I would venture out here again."}
{"text":"Food is great had the pleasure of meeting the owner and he delivered my order to my house
 Great guy great food
 Love it thanks."}
{"text":"I can't really comment on the food but I went there yesterday and the place was very busy inside - probably 12 tables of people.

Very smokey in the restaurant which I guess is expected for a grill house?  Probably need to work on ventilation.

The menu looked great with lots of cool brisket, ribs, hamburger, corn bread, etc... Here is the frustrating part. We were third in line to order (they don't seat you and take your order as it's supposedly more of a fast food style set up.  I waited about 15 mins and I was still second in line when I asked somebody behind the counter what was going on and they said for a hamburger it would be about 30 mins because they were backed up. 

So there were about 12 cooks and helpers in the kitchen and three people at the front and about 8 tables waiting on food???!!!?

Granted this was their opening week but still not a good sign that with that many people and they couldn't take an order in 15 mins

my advice, would be to wait a month and then check this place out so that they can sort out their kitchen issues.

So I went back to try again and couldn't be more impressed now with the food and service! Job well done guys! Food came out in less than 10 mins and everything was delicious.  Probably will be found here MANY times now 

Update - I think that this place is out of business now or having some personal issues as it has been closed many times and doesn't seem to be even open any longer"}
