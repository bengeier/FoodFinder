{"text":"Easily the best place in calgary to get a donair. Its been around since the mid eightys and the quality has never gotta worse. They always deliver on quality
 Definitley should give a try their jumbo donairs are the best."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place - they have the best donairs in the city - without a doubt."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. There is one man who works there and is always kind and sweet. He really makes you feel at home. On some of the walls is pictures of his family and occasionally I've seen his little daughter come in. The donairs aren't anything too spectacular but the service is wonderful. However it does get a bit crowded and only has a few very small tables. It's really great to see someone who cares about his customers"}
{"text":"A classic style of donair/falafel joint that had some promise based on offering bison and lamb donair in addition to the usual suspects. Unfortunately, while meat quality was okay, they do not spit roast it at all, so it lacks any delicious browning flavor. Toppings and wrap were unremarkable, so this spot gets only a middle of the road rating. Docking a point for small meat portion relative to similar spots, unless you pay extra an get the 1990's warmongering inspired \"Scud\" size."}
{"text":"So yummy! I will go out of my way to get a donair from here, even though there is a donair shop right by my work I will drive the 5 miles out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Good, fast service, and a selection of 4 different meats: bison, beef, chicken, and lamb.  Reasonably priced, clean location.

The donair itself was very bland.  The bison meat seemed like it had very little spice in it, and the sweet sauce wasn't very sweet.  Also, little extras like extra sauce or pickled cabbage that come standard at other restaurants carried an extra fee here.   Overall, would not recommend, there are way better donairs in the city."}
{"text":"sometimes not sanitary conditions, no gloves used to make wraps.  The shwarma has a bland taste, go to extreme pita."}
{"text":"Worse donair I ever had. Super dry. Ordered extra meat so they only put enough sauce for a small donair. So dry.  Pita stale. Veggies not fresh. Terrible taste."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Service. Family Run. 
My favourite dish here is the Chicken Schwarma with a liberal helping of their HomeMade Hot Sauce. They have a variety of sizes measured out by weight of meat at good rates. 
I Have to say of all the Donair shops I've visited around the city that this one has the BEST HOMEMADE HOT SAUCE of them all. 
*They loose a star for charging extra for extra sauce, pickles, cabbage and olives. Also they don't have black olives which is a natural on any Donair."}
{"text":"Best Lamb Shwarma in Calgary.

Small family run business.
I love it here. Great food, friendly atmosphere, decent prices and the flavours are great!

I've been probably a dozen times and the quality was excellent EVERY time!

Great taste and consistency - what more could you possibly want?"}
{"text":"I had the deluxe lamb donair at Uncle Moe's. My two star rating is due to the fact that I've had many better donairs at similar prices in Calgary. I will not be going back. 

Pros: 
- hearty helping of meat
- wrap was sturdy and fresh, quite large as well
- the meat was heated with a grill before going in the wrap
- the lamb was very tasty 

Cons:
- vegetables didn't taste quite as fresh as most other donair places
- they charged fifty seconds extra for standard toppings like pickles, turnips and banana peppers
- the service was pretty slow
- the store was baking hot"}
{"text":"Very well organized and excellent, friendly service from the people that run this place.  Even during lunch-hour rushes they are able to get you fed within a couple of minutes.  Watching them work is like watching a well tuned machine.

The donair meat is excellent and they make it themselves.  The wraps they choose are the perfect size and their donairs are sized and priced great.  There are 3-5 small tables to sit and eat but most people take their food to go so seating isn't too much of an issue.

Great food, great prices and great people!"}
