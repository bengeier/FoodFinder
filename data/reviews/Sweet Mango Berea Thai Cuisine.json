{"text":"Recently, I had been thinking a lot about Pad Thai. After doing a little early morning yard work, the girl friend and I decided Sweet Mango was in our future. In just my second visit this wonderful little Berea gem, I again walked away feeling full and happy.  The service was great. We arrived during the lunch time rush. It was steady, but not congested, and we were seated right away. The staff was again warm, friendly and attentive. Our order was quickly placed and prepared. On the previous visit I had Pad Thai but must have forgotten to request a little heat. On this recent visit I inquired about spice, to which I was told to rank my preferred spiciness level on a 10 scale. Being that I like things a little spicy I felt 7 was my lucky number. In retrospect 5 may be my future number. But, I enjoyed the Pad Thai so much more with the heat. Most people will find a sub 5 star spice level satisfactory. Plenty of water was brought my way and I was appreciative of that. I also enjoyed a Thai Ice-T and some potstickers as an appetizer. Overall, the food was well prepared and it had great presentation. Plus it was affordably priced. The restaurant was very clean and aesthetically pleasing. Many thanks go out to the wonderful staff! We will be back soon! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Thai food, had chicken Pad Thai was about the best I have had. The spice is Thai, not the usual red pepper flakes."}
{"text":"Pad Thai, Thai Style Basil, Spring Rolls.., you cannot go wrong here. The food is amazing as is the service. I dine at Sweet Mango at least a few times a year and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Good Thai option in Berea. Good prices and solid food. Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles are good to order. Quick turn around times, take out is ready when you get there. Small dining room. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Things I liked about Sweet Mango:  nice atmosphere (we were dining outside on a beautiful day), attentive and pleasant service, reasonably priced menu with the standard variety of Thai curries, noodle dishes, rolls, etc., and generous portions.

The one thing I didn't like, unfortunately, was the food.  Three of us dining ordered pad thai w/tofu, country pad thai w/chicken, and massaman curry.  The curry looked and smelled pretty good but unfortunately I didn't order that!  My pad thai consisted of cooked noodles with a sauce, plain pan-fried tofu (not cooked in sauce), a dash of peanuts on the top, and the flower carrot and orange slice on the side.  There was some residual evidence of egg white sticking to some of the noodles.  No bean sprouts, no spring onions!  The country pad thai was essentially the same with a darker sauce; I'm not sure if the chicken was cooked in the sauce.  My dish overall lacked flavor and the tofu was overcooked and tasteless.  It was extremely mediocre, even bad.

The complimentary wonton soup was a nice touch, but the lettuce in the soup had black specks on it-- not sure what was going on with that.

Also, I ordered a Thai iced tea which was really not very tasty at all.  I don't often have Thai iced tea so it's possible that I just didn't know what I was getting into-- but I drink a lot of tea, including red tea, so I thought I'd enjoy this.  The flavor seemed \"off\" and so bitter that I could barely drink it.

The positive reviews here on Yelp make me think that maybe we happened to visit at a bad time (it was a weekday at the beginning of lunchtime).  It's unfortunate; there are a lot of nice things about this restaurant.  But ultimately the point of going to a restaurant is to get a good meal, and a Thai place should be able to at the very least produce a better pad thai than I can make at home (which is a very low bar!).  Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming for years and they never disappoint. The atmosphere is quiet and pleasant for conversation. The food is always great. The staff are all kind and courteous. I would spend all my money here if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I really love Sweet Mango--like a lot.  They use some very spicy dipping sauces, and their fried appetizers are pretty great.  I am also a fan of their bubble tea-- it's quite nice and sweet.

I am also a fan of their curries; I like their approach to \"doneness\" for curry veggies--slightly al-dente and crunchy--gives it a really nice fresh taste.  Love it.  Not all thai places take this approach, but I strongly prefer it.  I've also, without a doubt, have tasted the best orange chicken in my entire life at this restaurant.

Their presentation is very nice too--they cut some veggies into flower shapes, but it's not just a visual garnish--they choose a veggie that actually COMPLEMENTS THE TASTE of the dish-- a very nice touch!

I go here whenever I'm in the area and never leave disappointed.  Careful though--appetizers and bubble teas can rack up a large bill.  I also prefer the restaurant in Berea because they have a bento box lunch that is affordable, while Strongville location doesn't have that..."}
{"text":"A favorite work-time lunch spot (from Olmsted Falls), their Bento box lunches are perfect in size and price.

Packed with a bunch of different flavors and choices, these box meals come with a small cup of soup, side salad, rice, main dish, and a selection of small appetizer choices.

This time around i decided to try their Massaman Curry chicken and it was simply wonderful.  The creamy curry with a slight kick married perfectly with the strips of chicken and crispy vegetables swimming around inside.

The staff at this restaurant are incredible attentive and pleasant, we love coming here for a bite."}
{"text":"Rarely do I take the time to review a restaurant when I'm just passing through somewhere. However, this place was amazing. The prices were very fair ($10.95 for a huge portion of chicken curry), and the flavor was exceptional. I would definitely say this was one of the most delicious Thai places I've been to in a long time. I got the red curry with chicken at a medium spice. It was spicer than anticipated, but not unbearable. My husband also got a curry and hasn't stopped talking about it since yesterday. Needless to say, if we are passing through again we won't think twice about where to eat!"}
{"text":"the place is too small to eat in, if you get take out, check and make sure you got the correct selection, I don't get why they charge so much money for what they serve"}
{"text":"We got take out here last night and it's nothing to rave about. The food was just \"ok\", not bad. The fried rice is barely fried at all, the fried potstickers were SOGGY, and we ordered egg rolls but were given crab Rangoon. Probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I like Sweet Mango. 

This is a welcome addition to Berea, and I'm thankful for it.   I love that there are wonderful vegetarian options.  The best thing, in my opinion is the Green Garden which is a host of steamed vegetables.  Thank you Sweet Mango for not stir frying EVERYTHING and saucing everything. :)

I do wish they had more traditional Bubble Tea.  The kind served here is more like a Tapioca Milkshake.  

The servers are always sweet and nice, if not sometimes a little harried because there are only one or two of them.

Check it out.  Its a nice little space for a meal."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and got one if the specials that included soup, small appetizer, small salad and entree. Reasonable price at $10 for the whole thing. 

The soup was tasty, decent (but very small) salad but the tofu triangles were slightly overdone. I got a curry dish with brown rice and tofu for the entree and that was very good and flavorful with fresh ingredients. 

I was there about 1 and the place was 1/2 full but very quiet. Very clean inside and a pleasant interior. 

Service was good but nothing stood out. 

Decent place for an inexpensive but good lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite thai place. EVER. The pad thai is the bomb. We lived in the area from 2009-2011, and now we're in Texas, but I still dream of Sweet Mango Thai. No other place has ever compared to their amazing pad thai."}
{"text":"Service and atmosohere was nice, and the food came out extremely quick. 

I was very happy with my lunch box, and my yellow curry was delish. 

Knocked off a star because my boyfriend said that although he liked his pad thai, he's had better. 

Also, my coconut soup was super yummy but the mushrooms were raw (I could tell they just kinda threw 'em in there last minute)

The mangos in the mango roll were not ripe, which gave them a yummy sour-y type flavor rather than sweet, which I liked a lot, but there was some really hard to chew bites of mango. 

Overall, no biggie to the abovementioned things, because we still thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Price points were also very affordable for our mini-feast."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to go to this place anytime I'm in the area. I don't have Thai in the town I live in so anytime I'm going to or from the airport I hope that they're open so I can get some of their food. Every time I go it is hot and delicious and well worth the cost. I only wish I got to visit more often."}
{"text":"This small Thai place on the commons of Berea is a very clean little restaurant. 
Lots of glass in front that lets in a lot of natural light.
I really enjoy Thai food and I was hoping for a great lunch after reading the reviews. Well my gf had a great lunch. Me,not so much.
My gf had the won ton soup. It was very good. She loved it. I had Tom Yum Goong. It was so so.
The gf ordered the pad thai country style. It was fantastic. I had Basil Beef Kapow. Sigh. The sauce was very watery and as a result the meat was boiled instead of seared. This caused it be be tough and dry.
I really struggled with how many stars to give. My gf had a 5 star lunch. I had a weak two star lunch. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? Well my gf doesn't like menus with hundreds of choices. I always tell her the way to deal with it is first go to chef specialties and then look for chili peppers. So that is what I did here. So if I order a house specialty, how can I have ordered the wrong thing.
I've settled on three because hers was very good but the kitchen is inconsistent, at least on this day. I don't want to discourage anyone from coming here because I would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! In town visiting from California where I've had plenty of Thai food and this one is up there! Not only is the food delicious and the staff friendly, the presentation of everything is first-class! I will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I expected more from this restaurant. 

The location was clean, and the staff was very friendly. The food also came very quickly which is a huge bonus. However the quality was just alright. I had the orange chicken and found it to be a little dry and overly cooked. 

I would try this place again, but maybe next time it will be for lunch instead."}
{"text":"I've always loved coming here for the amazing food and service. They're always very friendly and quick with bringing the food out. Sometimes that can feel rushed but when you're starving, the food can't come quick enough! :)"}
{"text":"Been going for years.  The Crazy Noodles are my favorite but everything is good.  Consistently clean restaurant, friendly service, and fresh food."}
{"text":"I'm a semi-often regular here - mostly around lunch.  Located in a non-descipt store in the heart of Berea square, Sweet Mango is never a let down. I'm in love with their Pad Thai - the traditional or the country style ( a spicier version ).  Pair the pad thai with an order of edamame for lunch and you most certainly skip dinner all together.  Many of their items are very well prepared with a balanced taste of flavor, aroma, and portion.  You can substitute white rice for brown a little healthier carb consumption.  If you are visiting for dinner, ask for the lunch portion as their dinner portion tends to be big in portion.

Sweet Mango provides a small eatery feel with polite wait staff, quick service, and an always clean place. In summertime they have very small outdoor patio dining.  They carry the standard thai affair from appetizers to entree to dessert.  They seem to take pride in their quality and it shows.  The prices are very reasonable $3 - $9 for lunch."}
{"text":"This is a camo-friendly establishment with great Thai food. The Beef Macadamia and Duck Choo Chee were amazing."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Cleveland. This place is reasonable and friendly. The food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Maxing our the spicy scale at many Thai restaurants yields an \"American\" spicy dish.  Not at Sweet Mango.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I did not expect to have a good thai experience in Ohio. This is a very pleasant surprise. 
The food here is a bit off thai, and a bit more fusion. Although the decor isn't too contemporary. Chicken seems to be the main theme on the menu. Most entrees either chicken or veggie.

I started my meal with the tum yum goong. That's kinda a standard thing to try anyway. The thai hot and sour soup! The soup was tasty, but it was more sweet then hot or sour. I guess it has to cater to the Ohio crowd in some way.
Then I had the larb. The larb usually comes with minced meat (yes, it's chicken only here), lime juice and other spices. Given that it was white meat chicken, I wasn't expecting much flavor from the meat. It really didn't matter. The minced chicken had tiny little pieces to pick up superb flavors in the juice that blended in lime, lemongrass and some other stuff I can't quite figure out. This might be one of the most tasty larb I have had. I highly recommend it.

For the entree, I went with the default choice as well. I had the pad ga prow (or however you like to spell it). Again, it's chicken only. I don't think I ever had this dish with chicken, this was the first time. It was yet another surprise. The flavor isn't as overpowering as the larb. The key here is the texture. It seem like the chicken was minced, steamed then stir fried. The overall taste was better than I expected. It's not authentic, it's not fusion. It's somewhere in the middle. I would definitely put this in the \"excellent\" range, and a solid 4 star."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but it's all about food yes? Pad thai is the classic Thai dish. Theirs is just plain awful. Mushy noodles, overuse of vinegary flavoring, stale shrimp,two or three green onions shoots, a tad of fried egg, a little bit if crushed peanuts. From this experience, the only good thing there is Singh beer. It was obvious I wasn't eating the dish other than the shrimp. But the friendly staff just smiled at me, never inquired why I hadn't eaten much. At yhe end I said it was sour and i didn't like it. And no response. I went out of my way to find the restaurant and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Have eaten here for lunch twice in the last few months.  The first time I was not blown away by my meal, and realized I should've taken my wife's suggestion and ordered the Thai Style Basil.  This is an excellent dish, especially if you like spicy food.  Very flavorful and prepared as ordered (spicy!).  The Siam Rolls are also very good.  I would imagine that most of the menu items are excellent, but it will be difficult to order anything other than the TSB.  Great service, too!"}
{"text":"I met some girlfriends for dinner here a couple of weeks ago: In the interest of full disclosure, before our viewing of Magic Mike (I promise it was not my idea.)  Anyway, I just figured I had an ethical responsibility to share that, so that you could read my review knowing it's written by a person with poor judgment.  I have to say, I have not spent a lot of time in Berea, but was pleasantly surprised by the nice little downtown area.  Anyway, back to the restaurant.  We decided to sit at one of the tables outside (though we were disappointed to discover we couldn't have alcohol out there.)  The waiter brought us our waters, and my friend's had a slice of lemon in it, and mine did not.  Now, I didn't really want a slice of lemon in my water, but I couldn't help but feel like the absence of this delightful slice of citrus was the waiter's way of saying \"I'm sorry, you do not deserve citrus fruit.  You are unattractive, a bad person, and generally unworthy of the effort to cut one slice from a lemon.\"  When he brought the pitcher out to refill, we realized that there was a slice of lemon in the pitcher, and it had just happened to slide into my friends glass midpour.  This was a victory for my morale, a crushing defeat for my friend's.  

Anyway, we all enjoyed our meals thoroughly.  One of the girls was not familiar with Thai food, but fell in love.  I went with the pretty standard pad thai.  It was very flavorful and all the ingredients really tasted fresh.  You got a really good sized portion, I didn't even eat half of my meal.  The prices were excellent, granted, I only got water and a pad thai, but even with tip I think I ended up spending around ten dollars.  I would definitely eat here again, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Thai food.  The location is clean, the service was nice, and they even fold your straw wrapper into an origami flower!  What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Service is great here and the food is great, some of the menu is different then the one in Strongsville."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in a charming neighborhood.  The food is delicious with nice attention to presentation.  Loved the mango curry!  The staff is pleasant and friendly too.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night for the first time. We both had heard and read good reviews for this place. We started with shrimp appetizers which were pretty good. I ordered the Mango Surprise because the description was interesting. Well, it was disappointing to say the least. The menu described it having shrimp and chicken, but it only had 3 shrimp. The chicken was very bland...actually the dish was quite bland. My wife had shrimp and pasta dish. She was not pleased with her choice either. 

I really wanted to like this place. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes? Not sure if I'd go back. There are other places that serve similar cuisine that are a lot better and less expensive."}
{"text":"I have eaten in MANY Thai restaurants.  This one is quite nice.  Very clean, great food and great presentation.  I think sometimes people think the food has to be exactly the same as their favorite Thai restaurant and are not open to some subtle and often wonderful differences.  If you are looking to eat the exact same Thai food you had somewhere else, go to the exact same restaurant.  If you are open, you will enjoy this excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Been here several times since we discovered it a couple of months ago, and we  love it. Have had the wonton soup, Thai salad, spring rolls, pot stickers, basil chicken fried rice, pad thai regular and country style. Everything has been delicious. Service is outstanding, decor is nice, and the place is spotless. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very yummy. .. enjoyed my dinner and enough for a second meal.  Staff very friendly and would Def come back if in the area again!"}
{"text":"Ok, had to eat here again! Brought my aunt & uncle and all 4 of us pracically licked our plates! Had pad Thai, mango fried rice, and I tried the salmon red curry. We also splurged and got mango rolls and coconut and green tea ice cream! All delicious! The ice cream comes in 3 scoops, so order less and share cuz there's plenty. Oh, and to top ot off, if you order a drink, the straw wrapper is designed into a flower! How thoughtful!"}
{"text":"Best place to get Thai food in Cleveland! The restaurant is cute, clean and cozy - the wait staff has always been friendly and attentive. 

I am a creature of habit and always get Prik King Curry and Sweet Mango's does not disappoint. It's a little more spicy than other Thai places I have had, but I love it. My husband has ordered numerous things off of the menu and liked everything he has had.

Another staple in our visit is the carb rangoons. They are sweeter and more pastry-like that any other that I've had, but are ABSOLUTELY delicious.

The last things we always get (and love) is the Thai custard and sweet rice dessert combo - I don't even like custard on a usual day and I love this dessert.

For those that came on a bad day, please give this place another chance! We love it!!"}
{"text":"We came in here for lunch one cold, windy, blustery snowy afternoon!

I ordered a light lunch, a bowl of their Tom Yum soup, plus hot tea.

The soup was tasty and excellent and the tea was perfect for a cold, snowy day!

I will definitely come here again to try out some other dishes!

#SweetMango"}
{"text":"3.5 stars would be an excellent option for this place, but 4 is close enough.

This is a pretty solid Thai lunch option that my coworkers and I frequent (about once a week when we're in town). The service is pleasant and reliably pretty fast, and the food doesn't disappoint, although there's better Thai food around if you are able to go further out from Berea. The only caveat is to be aware of the spice levels - they ask you for a spice rating from 1 to 10, but these are very inconsistent, with a 5 on two different days being completely different, and my 4 yesterday being spicier than a previous 7. [They're quick to keep your water glass filled, though!] 

Given the lunch options in the Berea area, we'll be keeping this place on our roster."}
{"text":"Delicious flavors from the drunken crazy noodles to my favorite mango chicken curry. Near the airport it's a great little restaurant in cute downtown Berea. Apparently the orange chicken is a favorite."}
{"text":"My parents have been raving about this amazing Thai place near their house for the past year and we finally made it over to try it out tonight! It did not disappoint. It's not a huge place, but luckily we got there before the dinner rush. The service was awesome, the menu is very expensive and our meals were delicious. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a quick dinner to go from here. Since I didn't dine in, I'm just going to review the service and food.

Service: very sweet and welcoming. I was greeted with all smiles when I walked in. Also very pleasant calling in over the phone.

Food: I ordered the green goddess. This is rice with steamed vegetables and a peanut sauce. The rice was cooked perfectly, and the peanut sauce was amazing. The veggies and tofu were not as great. While the veggies were steamed, the sweet potatoes and green beans tasted very undercooked. I'm not a big fan of crunchy sweet potato. The mango was a delicious touch, but the tofu was very greasy, maybe a little over fried?

I would definitely try this spot again, but I would order something different."}
{"text":"We were attending a softball game st BW and used Yelp to search for local restaurants. What a find!  The service was friendly and we were seated immediately. We ordered their spring rolls to start and they were delicious, much better than most. My wife had the Pad Thai and I had their signature Thai Basil. Their portions were generous but not huge. The presentation was beautiful with artfully carved garnish and lovely dishes. Most importantly the food was delicious. Perfect spice levels, appropriate meat to vegetable ratios. We are our full and immediately started to talk about how great the leftovers were going to be for lunch the next day. This is a do not miss if you are in the Berea area."}
{"text":"Worst panang curry I ever had. Veggies were not even properly cooked and the grevy was very light. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Great service and although my entree was just ok, the appetizer, bubble tea and the dessert were extremely good. Would definitely go back for sure"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Thai food, and was so excited when I moved to ohio to find this lovely little place right in town. The service was good and their attention to detail is impeccable. The restaurant itself is small and cozy. I will admit that it was not my favorite Thai spot, but the experience was pleasant enough."}
{"text":"Recommend.   Delicious Thai food. Great services.  Good location near Baldwin Wallace College. Must try Veggie Basil fried rice, Dunken/crazy veg noodles, Padthai.   Coconut soup was super sweet and I didn't like it.  Server offered it without sugar and it was ok.   I asked for everything spicy and easy on sweet part.  Go and enjoy ur self."}
{"text":"Last night was my first experience at Sweet Mango and let me tell you: it lives up to the great reviews! Honestly, I went to downtown Berea craving pumpkin ale, but my friend suggested we get dinner instead and I really don't know how to turn down Thai food. The restaurant itself is small and quiet and really cute. They had a small-but-reasonably-priced wine list, and you really can't go wrong with pinot noir for $5 a glass. 

   The pot stickers I ordered were a bit on the expensive side but delicious. The coconut seafood soup was a bit sweeter than expected (absolutely no spice), but it hit the spot on a semi-cold September night. I guess the main reason for the high rating was the service was great! There was no wait, the waitress was always prompt, but not overbearing. Oh and the presentations were beautiful! Perfect little carved veggies that I didn't want to eat because they were so cute! I will definitely come back and try the pad thai next time!"}
{"text":"On the other side of town for dinner tonight and had a taste for some Thai food.The yelp ratings showed this to be a good place to go. Definitely agree. Food was EXCELLENT as well as the service .  This is 50 min from here me but will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"I placed an order to go for lunch and picked it up around noon. This place was packed. I ordered the Pad Thai Country Style and it was delicious. The flavor was the perfect amount of spice and sweetness. The price was great too. Most Pad Thai places I have been to around Cleveland charge you around 9-10 bucks, This was $7.95.  I will definitely will be back. I have never been over to Berea before and loved the store fronts. I will definitely be back to try some other entrees."}
{"text":"My mom and I wanted Thai food and the place we loved on bagely wasn't there anymore. We asked yelp for what was near and Sweet Mango was 1.2 miles away.  We are glad we decided to eat there! The service was quick and good - never an empty glass! We ordered the mango rolls as an app and they were delicious! The sweet and sour sauce with crushed peanuts was a great addition. I ordered the tofu pad Thai and loved it! I even had some spicy sauce on the side to add and it was nice adjusting the heat to my liking. I had enough left to create a meal for home! My mom ordered the eggplant scallop dish. She loved the scallops and vegetables covered in a really great sauce! We would definitely go back - try not to go around 6ish on a Friday night. It was packed! Luckily a couple left soon after we arrived!"}
{"text":"Sweet Mango continues to impress every visit. The interior feels refined,  always clean, with servers that are sweet and accommodating. 

I come here for: 
 - Tom Khar Gai soup, always creamy with a perfect hint of citrus. 
 - Pad Thai country style (you can order spice levels 0-10 stars..and up)
 - Mango sticky rice for dessert. 

The presentation is always impeccable, down to carefully twisted straw wrappers, meticulously slivered carrots and perfectly formed towers of rice.

As far as affordable neighborhood Thai goes, I give Sweet Mango a confident five stars."}
{"text":"Cornerstone was too packed. So was Mike's. So we decided to take our hunger to Sweet Mango. It was a nice escape from the crowds at the above mentioned restaurants. I would say that it is on par with Thai Kitchen in Lakewood or Ty Fun in Tremont. I enjoyed it. The portions were just about right. The appetizers were great. My friend and his wife had a few meals here and say that they have yet to be disappointed. I think it is a great option for food in Berea. The server and hostess were awesome."}
{"text":"Delightful staff and food. My girlfriend and I made this our go-to restaurant when we want something hot during the cold winter months. The lunchbox special is a great deal and you'll get every bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Tasteless, suburban Asian food. All I can say is that that the suburbanites who have it 4 and 5 stars must be afraid to go to Chinatown ... But even by suburban standards it's weak. High Thai'd and Bangkok Thai are suburban Thai restaurants that are much better."}
{"text":"The PAD THAI Country Style (Level 2 spicy) is the best I've ever had. The staff is always friendly and I've had not but great service. Highly recommended giving this place a shot. Even if it's a pick up! Well worth it. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been here many, many times for Thai food. It happens to be really close to where my husband used to live, but now we drive out to Berea just for this place. 
On my latest visit I got one of the lunch boxes with the Masamman Curry. 
The masamman curry is my favorite thing on the menu. I like it a little spicy. Tons of flavor and the veggies/potatoes are always cooked to perfection. 
My hubs usually gets the Mango curry which is also amazing. 
Between the two of us we've tried all of the curries, the pad thai, and most of the seafood dishes. All full of flavor and delicious. 
We always get it with a Thai iced tea to help calm the mouth after some really nice spice. 
The fact that the service is amazingly fast and friendly as well is always a plus. 
I really think that this is one of my favorite Thai places in the Cleveland area. (Somehow, I like the Berea location better than the Strongsville one.. FYI)."}
