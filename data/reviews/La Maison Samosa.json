{"text":"Samosas très bons pour un dollar! Biens assaisonnés, pas trop piquants, bonne texture des patates. Essayez les wraps au pois chiches,  j'oublie le nom mais c'est rendu notre chose préférée là bas, moins gras que les samosas et délicieux . Les petites boulettes aux légumes deux pour 1$ sont excellentes aussi!"}
{"text":"I was told their samosas and flat bread were absolutely without a doubt gluten free. I told the staff person I have celiacs and she reassured me. It turns out the items I purchased were not gluten free! Disappointed the staff didn't take me seriously just to make a few bucks."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with $1 samosas, it's my go-to whenever I'm on the verge of being broke! Friendly staff and cozy ambiance"}
{"text":"The samosas are only one dollar each!! They're big, tasty, not too spicy but just right!!! Very nice man who owns the place! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!! VERY tasty!!! I will definitely go again since I live close to them!"}
{"text":"Stepping inside the store is like stepping back in time or better yet a portal India 10 or 20 years ago. Once you are inside the spices grab you by the nose and you know you are going to buy something and you know it will make you happy. Sure they sale a veraity of stuff from India or India related but the place is calked the Samosa's house, so you must try one. They cost 1$ each (super cheap) and they are just amazing. I am hooked on their Vege Samosa. Step inside and buy one for the road...you will thank me later!"}
