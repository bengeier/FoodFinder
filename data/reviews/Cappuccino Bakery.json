{"text":"This is the best Italian bakery in the area. Good service and fantastic food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Charming little Italian bakery at King Rd. And hwy 27, with beautiful pastries and an impressive hot table. Offering homemade zucchini fritters, daily pasta specials, quiche, chicken Caesar wraps, sausages, cooked veggies and veal Parmesan sandwiches (just to name a few things). Great for lunch or take out if you're in a bind for dinner."}
{"text":"Please improve your sweets. I have bought them on several occasions and they are always stale. If you can't sell them within three days throw them out and bake fresh.  Some do have a one day shelf life and I bet they sit in the window for weeks. Won't buy another pastry until I see a change.  How can you call this a bakery when your pastries are awful."}
{"text":"This place is great! People are personable and service is always on par. The food at the hot table are fantastic  and made fresh. Pastries and food are fairly priced (not ridiculously expensive). Nobleton might be out of the way for some, but it's not a bad idea to go for a drive and hit up this cute and charming caf√©."}
{"text":"0 stars?  Ordered a party size pizza with Italian sausage. Take out menu says $18.50.  I pick up the pizza they tell me it's $26...$21 for the pizza and $5 for a premium topping. Italian sausage, $5?  They cut up one whole sausage and placed 1 slice of sausage per 1 party size square.  Also, the pizza was so salty, everyone drank at least 1 litre of water to try and hydrate.  I stopped buying pastries because they were always dry and now I'll never buy a pizza again from there. On top of all that, get attitude from the owner when I questioned pricing. Heard bad things about their pricing on their hot table too. One less household to give you money. Good luck!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop over on the way to the cottage. Generally hit up Mario's bakery, but decided to give this place a try. In terms of size and selection, this place is big. Plenty of space to sit down. Selection is also enormous. We had a prosciutto sandwich and plate of tortellini. Both were good. They also have a wood oven pizza, gelato etc. In terms of value Mario's is better imho, but in terms of quality both are comparable. But depends on what you're looking for, personally for sandwiches & pizza we'll stop here, for everything else Mario's."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Inflated prices for average food Desserts taste awful Over rated."}
{"text":"Horrendous customer service. Over priced. Rude owner. They tried to bend me over for a few scoops of cold salad. An argument at the cash over the price of my meal led to me leaving hungry and frustrated with the way in which the staff handled the situation. This establishment has a lot of good food but needs a lesson in common curtesy and customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out from the hot table.  A piece of stuffed focaccia(small, about 4 inches ) was $8.00 ! I got 1 small piece of spinach focaccia, a slice of pepperoni pizza and a can of coke to go. Was almost $16.00 ! The food was good, the price was a shock to be honest.  I actually called  about half an hour after getting my take out to say I think I was overcharged, the girl on the phone was very nice and ask what I ordered, I went over my order and she added up the amount to $15.62.  I said yes, that's what I paid, she is the one that told me the piece of spinach focaccia is $8.00.  Whoa ! Never getting that again. I guess my fault for not asking first what the price was when I saw it sitting in the hot table."}
{"text":"Tiramisu for breakfast?  I was tempted! After a fruitless search for a brekky place in Nobleton, I spotted the Cappuccino Bakery as I glanced over from Hwy 27.  I walked in the door and was hit with the wonderful fragrance of a wood burning pizza oven, and wall to wall baking.  One wall was all fresh baked goods and coolers.  The opposite wall had coolers full of tasty baked treats, Italian sliced meats, and a hot display of other foods.  I had stopped in for a quick breakfast, but with everything there, I could not decide.  I finally noticed a breakfast menu screen at the back of the restaurant, so I defaulted back to breakfast.  A simple classic eggs, sausages, potatoes and fresh multigrain toast for $6.  And the coffee! Of course they pull fresh espresso drinks, teas, this place has no idea what a single market is.  They have breakfast, lunch, dinner, pizza, baking, sandwiches, everything.  Comfortable, lively, clean, organized, and popular.  Free wifi. I'm sitting here staring at a tall cooler filled with cakes.  I think I want a whole one for desert.  What a great way to top off breakfast! Now, if I can kill a few hours in the vicinity until lunch time..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch great variety and quality!! The Zeppole were amazing!! The porchetta sandwich was right on. Have been here before and never disappointed. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"This little bakery went  from a small shop with a hot table in the back to a wonderful Italian Eatery! The deli and bakery are still there but the new location is so large with so much seating. And the food OMG how affordable for a complete Italian dinner. I had the Platter which includes Pasta, Meat and Vegetables and everything was so delicious and fresh. And the staff are all so helpful and nice they never make you feel like just a Mangia Cake."}
{"text":"Picked up pizza and sandwiches to go for lunch today. Had the assorted sandwich and a vegetable slice. Both tasted great, very fresh and good portions for the price. The place was very busy at 11:30 but the servers are well organized and friendly so the line moves quick. Overall great experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We live in town and choices are far and few in Nobleton. We purchased pizza and pastries from cappuccino. All was good until we started looking into pricing, this place seems to advertise one price and charge another \"oh its the tax \" for those who can count, you've been gouged! I stopped going here and the owners don't care about the loss, plenty of fools walk in the door."}
{"text":"Totally overrated and quite expensive ,  Bought the donuts, 3 dollars each ... dry and under filled.  My dear mother said after one bite ....please go and return them I am so sad that you spend $ 18 plus tax on them ...frankly had better from a grocery store ...."}
