{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!  Excellent food and Excellent Service!  We have already been back a few times and will definitely keep this in our \"rotation\"!!  Our next stop is RUE 21!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and cozy and charming atmosphere.  Everything I've had has been delicious from the grape leaves appetizer, escarole, moussaka main entree, striped bass entree and pork chops entree.  Also, nice to see a great restaurant like this in Avon Lake.  This one seems like it'll be a keeper on that corner!"}
{"text":"The moussaka and lamb shank are mouth watering! Delicious food from starters to dessert! Excellent service. Definitely worth coming back!"}
{"text":"Taki's, you get 5 Stars!  So my dad and i were just looking for some place to eat. We saw \"Taki's Greek Kitchen\" and thought we'd try greek food for once. The place used to be another restaurant called Tucky's and about a year or two before Tucky's, the spot housed a starbucks; unfortunately those places went out of business primarily because the location where both Tucky's and Starbucks was horrible (they should really make more entrances to the place). Seeing Taki's being built, both my dad and I waved it off thinking \"It's probably not going to last\" (this was based on location, nothing else.)  However, we really wanted to try greek food and had no knowledge of Taki's AT ALL. When we went, we really thought it was going to be like an $8-10 restaurant. We walked in and were blown away by this place!! It was a lot more fancy than we thought, but still affordable. I was glad I wore a button-up shirt that day because I felt like I needed to dress up.   Right when we walked in, I noticed the bar to the left of the entrance. The maitre'D was busy sitting another table; however, someone from the bar saw us right away, made eye contact, and stopped what he was doing to first ask us if we had a reservation, and then when we said we didn't have one, said \"No problem!\" And proceeded to seat us.   The inside of the place is fantastic; it's not tacky or super Greek. I don't have that much knowledge of Greek culture since I spent my adolesence in Southern California surrounded by mostly jewish people, hispanics, and asians. What I do know about Greek culture is mostly superficial; you know, like \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" or \"Sisterhood of Traveling Pants\" kind of stuff. What I imagine when I think of Greece are those nice, white and/or blue hillside homes looking over the water. This place was not tacky in that sense, but instead had the professional decor of a michelin rated restaurant.  Our waiter was a very tall gentleman with caring eyes and a kind smile. We sat parallel to the fireplace which provided not only asthetic appeal through the flicker of its flames, but also a warm atmosphere.   The tables are already set-up with huge wine glasses before you sit down. Both my dad and I are not wine people (but if my mom was here, she would drink the lion's share), so they took the glasses away and we got two cola's and waters instead.  It's a very dim place; I looked around and didn't expect any kids to be there, but there were actually two families there with a few kids each. The rest of customers seem to be either middle aged or of older age; several families, and I saw a young couple who seem to be in high school come here on a date (this was a Friday night). Everyone, though, was dressed up, which was nice.  Before I write an essay let me get to the food. I don't remember the names of the plates unfortunately (but if you look in the photos, I have 2 that I took of our dishes). Dad ordered the lamb and I ordered the pork chops. The pork chops (2!) came with some vegetable, a lemon, and a side order of Greek fries with fetta cheese? (I think. Sorry, my description might be off!) And my dad's lamb came with arugula salad which was discounted with a meal and rissoto. I think. But, despite my ability to recollect the names of what we ate, I must say, the TASTE of the food was out of this world. Whomever the chef is did a great job choosing exactly what goes in each dish. In my opinion, the combination of flavors is like writing a good book or listening to a symphony; the flavors must all work together. The blend of the vegetables, the lemon, the seasoned pork chops cooked to perfection, and the Greek fries seasoned with fetta (no ketchup needed) was to my liking. My dad would say the same; he really enjoyed his lamb.  The place is small but really well layed out - you can see the kitchen from your seating, which is exciting and different - not many places that I know of do that. And the place wasn't that expensive (note, though, that we didn't order alcohol - it would probably be a little bit more if we did).   Would I come here again? Yes! Would I recommend it for anyone looking for a high-end restaurant in the suburbs?? YES!! This is the first restaurant I've seen outside of downtown Cleveland that is this nice and professional. Sure, it's located in a strip-mall, but don't be fooled by the outside. It's worth driving over 40 minutes to get to; lucky for me, it's located right nearby my dad's place. 5 stars all the way!!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food at Taki's especially the fish, lamb and fresh salads. It is also our go-to restaurant for special occasions! We had delicious Christmas Eve Dinner and everything from the appetizers to desserts was amazing! Staff is welcoming and professional."}
{"text":"Stopped into taki's for a quick lunch today before work... Wow! Great authentic greek food. They had all my favorites! Can not wait to take the family for drinks and dinner. Service was also quick and very informative when ordering."}
{"text":"If you want contemporary Greek, then this is for sure the place to go! The food is absolutely amazing: my friend always gets the Mydia (mussels) for an appetizer while I devour the entirety of our plate of Htipiti (a delicious dip consisting of roasted red peppers and whipped rousas feta) coupled with the wonderful pita that Taki's supplies. As far as entrees go, I think my favorites are probably the Brizola Hirini (two centercut bone-in pork chops with grilled lemon, evoo, and oregano) and the Braised Lamb Shank, which is baked in casserole, orzo, tomatoes, and kefalotiri. And no, I don't have this stuff memorized, I had to look them up on the menu just now!  Not just that, but the service is very attentive and eager to help and I often see the manager making rounds, asking how the food is. Overall, it's really nice to experience a restaurant where all of the employees put so much passion into their work. We've gotten Kelly as a server several times now, and she is fantastic! And one last thing, during the summer, you should definitely request the patio if it's open."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Finally a good Greek restaurant in the area.  Really authentic menu too."}
{"text":"Ordered the MACARONIA THALASSINA.  Did not like it at all - the waitress highly recommended it.  Minimal seafood and sauce had a strong flavor I could not identify - very much like vinegar.   My son ordered a burger which cost $13 - are they serious to charge that for a burger?   Never going back - my wife said her fish was ok however, not great, just ok.  Lastly, I asked for crushed red pepper for the pasta and they gave me about 1/16 inch in a 1 inch diameter cup, said they ran out...."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the chicken meatballs. They are served with plain arugula and balsamic, perfect combo.   The Greek wines I tried were awesome, it was fun to let the bartender pick for me seeing I don't know sh*t about Greek wine.   The staff is cool and puts off a fun family like vibe. It's a nice neighborhood place and I'm glad it's so close. Cute patio too."}
{"text":"The service was attentive, the meatball appetizer was delicious, and I enjoyed my bass entree. My husband had the lamb with orzo. He said the lamb was too fatty and he wouldn't order that entree again, but would be willing to return to try something else."}
{"text":"My husband and I just tried Taki's for lunch and we will definitely be returning customers! Friendly and attentive staff. Wonderfully authentic Greek choices. We had the Thursday plate which was short ribs and ouzo, what a treat! Try the spicy feta dip, fantastic! Who complains about drinks being too strong??!! Just that comment alone from \" Anastasia\" would make us try this place again :)"}
{"text":"Wish 4.5 stars was an option. We have been to Taki's close to a dozen times since it opened, and it has become one of our favorite go-to places. It has been a great addition to the Westshore dining scene. In all the times we've been there we've only had one dish we weren't totally satisfied by. It was the Lavraki: Mediterranean Sea Bass. It was not about flavor at all. The taste was great, and in line with the rest of the menu. The issue was the size. It was a much smaller, thinner fillet than we were expecting. We knew it wouldn't be a big fish, but we expected more for $26.   So that's where the half star went. Everything else about Taki's is 5-star: wine list, service, patio, specials, desserts. You really cannot go wrong there."}
{"text":"Best restaurant on the west side (in my opinion). I've tried just about everything on the menu and am always happy with my meal. Service is outstanding. I recommend their special of the day.  Always something interesting."}
{"text":"Awesome. Amazing food, amazing service. Truly authentic recipes that just melt in your mouth. The saganaki was perfect, the horiatiki was vibrant and perfectly seasoned. The lamb shank was amazing and so was the fish entree. So fresh. Danielle, I think, was very knowledgeable and fun. The manager or bartender , not sure the title, came over and said hi. Just a very welcoming, friendly, and delicious experience. We plan on going back for the daily specials that all sound amazing. We were new to Greek food, can't wait to try more.  Oh yeah. You have to try the Eckmeck for desert."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Taki's the other night.  The food was fresh and tasty, the atmosphere was inviting and the service was spot on.  Taki's is going to be on my short list of great west side restaurants."}
{"text":"Tried Takis for the first time last night. Was pretty blown away. The restaurant is tucked in a strip mall so by judging a book by its cover we just didn't know what to expect. The staff was great - explained the menus well and gave great recommendations. We will DEF be back.  Tried: seafood pasta, bacon wrapped pork, lamb shank. All amazing."}
{"text":"Great service,great food-including vegan dishes. Super yummy desserts! Outside patio was nice and quiet."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. It has a patio with umbrellas for nice outdoor seating. We ordered a trio of dips to start (must get the Tzatziki), the chicken meatballs (awesome), zucchini fritters (also awesome) and lamb burger al for two people. This was too much food for us (probably could have done without the burger) but we wanted to try everything because it all sounded so delicious! Also got a piece of baklava for the road, which did not disappoint. We also enjoyed their selection of Greek beer. I am not Greek at all, but this place seems pretty authentic, and the food was great! Also there is a fire pit outside on the deck and some lounge seating (which seems cool, but we didn't use)"}
{"text":"Refreshingly authentic and absolutely delicious! I have recently relocated from Pittsburgh which has a very diverse selection of cultural cuisines. Taki's is among the best I've ever had. And after spending four days in Greece a year ago I can endorse Taki's authenticity. And the greeting and service was first class."}
{"text":"Our family may have started a new Thanksgiving week tradition.  Tonight was out first time Taki's We had great service in an intimate dining room atmosphere. A nice feature in the dining room is the central fireplace which was burning tonight.  Both the calamari and flaming cheese were good tasting appetizers.   Moussaka, Greek sausage flat bread, and a couple of bone in pork chops were excellent.  We saw the skewer special severed to another table and immediately got buyer's remorse for not ordering it.  Naturally some Ouzo and special Taki Cafe (with Frangelico) finished off the meal. The restaurant is child friendly, and there  is a small bar, for those who like to dine at a bar.  I am already looking forward to next year and the Tuesday before Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Best Greek Food. Ever. Trio of dips awesome. Meatballs moist and bursting with flavor. Tiropita served hot with robust flavor and the honey drizzled on top added bonus flavor. Souvlaki terrific. My only disappointment....Pastitio is only served on Mondays. Gotta go back for that!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food around! It is a little pricey, but it is worth it.   The lavraki is very good and so are the dips that come with the pita bread. They also offer take-out, which is very convenient.  Taki's did a fantastic job catering my parents' anniversary party! Everyone kept raving about the chicken sto fourno and the sides. If I am catering a large party again, I would definitely choose Taki's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant in northeast ohio, well worth the 15 minute drive from downtiwn cleveland.  Try the Lavraki -- sea bass in a delicious blend of olives and other vegetables with a heavenly sauce.  They offer top quality authentic greek food at prices that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Creative Greek dining and wonderful service! New updated twist on Greek food. Appetizers, salads and main dishes were all fresh and delicious.  Our large group enjoyed the warm atmosphere and top notch service. Look forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"Yesterday night was our first visit at this eatery.  A small storefront tucked away in a shopping plaza, this restaurant is a gastronomic delight!  Luckily I had made reservations for a Saturday night as the place was packed!  Our dinner started with complimentary pita chips and a red pepper dip,which were polished off in no time! Our group of four had the Arni Youvetsi, Yemistes Pipieres, Moussaka and the Grilled Vegetable Souvlaki.  The lamb shank was marinated to perfection and was tender and juicy.  The moussaka was heavenly, creamy and flavored just right.  The dish looked small, but my friend could not finish it and was happy to box it home!  I had the orzo stuffed red peppers, a vegetarian dish, which came with perfectly done fingerling potatoes and a green salad that could have benefitted from some additional ingredients.  The red peppers though were finger-licking good!  The grilled vegetarian pita sandwich was tasty and just right for a smaller appetite. The french fries that came with it were a little too brown, but overall a truly wonderful dining experience and a great addition to the Westside eateries.  Do not leave without trying the Ekmek dessert, a truly inspired creation of pistachios, custard and cream. It is a sizable portion and one dessert was sufficient for our party of four.  We all loved this restaurant and will definitely be back soon! I gave this a four star review as the seating is a little tight and we were cold at our table by the door,but the food is 5 stars! Thank you Takis!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I cannot speak of the gastronomic experience mainly because my party and I never got the chance.  We made dinner RESERVATIONS at 7:45 on a Saturday. By definition, \"reservation\" means precisely, \"an arrangement whereby something, especially a seat or room, is booked or reserved for a particular person.\" At 7:55, the gentleman (owner?) advised us that our table had yet to avail, let alone be cleared for us---there were still people eating at four tops.  A table set for six was collecting dust as we awkwardly stood only 3ft from the hostess stand...waiting, waiting, waiting.... Couldn't even pass time at the small and occupied bar area. No apologies, no placating customers waiting 20 minutes by the time they decided to go elsewhere. Hospitality was absent. Not a good start for what we hoped to be a regular place for us to satisfy our cravings for authentic Greek food"}
{"text":"Delicious! So cute inside and excellent food! You have to try!! Carl was more than happy to educate me on some of the perfect offerings available."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Greek cuisine. We love dining in and ordering to go. Try the pork souvlaki for lunch - the baklava is heaven. Fish specials are always good. Make reservations on weekends because it's a small place and is quickly booked."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner and was treated to one of the best meals I have ever had! Food AND service were on point! We had  the grilled Octopus, lamb chops and pasta, and I'd highly recommend all three! Add the chocolate flourless torte for dessert if you saved room...also fabulous!! You just don't find Greek cuisine done as fine as this in Cleveland Ohio! Kudos to the chefs!"}
{"text":"My parent were excited to bring me here but, sorry, Taki's, to bring you down.  Owner was not there and staff was careless and kinda rude.  Sat outside to find heaters didn't work (although promised) so moved inside to overheated room.  I live in California and travel to Greece frequently so am familiar with greek foods and wines. My parents have always supported this place only to find portion size smaller and staff basically uncaring....undercooked and oversauced octopus, minuscule stuffed peppers...and Steven the waiter had the audacity to bascially infer my mother was a liar when she said things had changed...she has been there a lot,  No attempt was made to make anything right.  Wines have chance at being interesting but aren't.  Ran out of Monday night special by 7 PM.  Really not value for money at all aside from lamb burger  - which they insisted be cooked medium well...must be Ohio. A Greek restaurant in the pricey state of CA is less expensive and far fresher..."}
{"text":"Opa! Great service, great food, great atmosphere! It is slightly more expensive than the average restaurant but this is no average venue. My big fat Greek taste buds were royally impressed -Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum um... Stared off w calamari & saganaki... Yum!  Had the braised lamb shank... Yum!  Wife had moussaka... Yum!  Sun had Lamburger... Yum!  Dining room just a little crowded.  Service just a little slow.  This place is not inexpensive. The food, however... YUM! Oh... Try the Greek lemon pop... It was...  Well... you have the idea."}
{"text":"Holy Moly Everyone NEEDS to Check This Place Out!  This is Greek food at it's finest! I enjoyed every single bite of food I had during my dinner.  We started with the Spanakopita appetizer which is stuffed with spinach, onions, cheeses and herbs in a crispy, flaky phyllo dough. The flavors were full force and how can you go wrong eating anything wrapped in Phyllo Dough?!  My guest ordered the KAKAVIA (Fish Stew) which was on special the night we were there. He stated it was one of the best he has tasted and he has had his fair of Fish Stews (in Asia Town). I ordered the PAIDAKIA which are Char-Broiled Lamb Chops. WOW!! Cooked to perfection and the flavor was outstanding!  I need to go back and friends of mine who have visited recently talk about going back time and time again. What a great addition to Avon Lake!"}
{"text":"Great find on our visit to Cleveland. A friend had recommended Takis to us and really glad she did. We had a mezze selection of dolmades, spinnakopeta and octopus which was great. An ideal lunch. Friendly staff and very pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal here for a recent birthday celebration of mine, all preparations were modern twists on classic dishes.  As typical, we ate our meal \"family style\" where I controlled the menu with suggestions from around the table.  I had a nice glass of Ouzo 12 (on the rocks) to start my meal and the white Gaia NOTIOS wine we had paired so well with all of the dishes we ordered.  We started with a course of several different appetizers.  The table was brought two baskets of fresh, warm pita and sliced bread along with a paste-like spread made from fresh vegetables.  The tzatziki dip was bright and super-creamy served with lots of lemon, onions and dill.  The spanakopita were stacked on the high on the plate, super-buttery and light to the touch with filo dough and plenty of spinach and feta cheese within its pocket.  I am a huge fan of dolmades, so we had to have an odered.  They were served warm (over tzatziki sauce) and filled with beef and rice; my older daughter thought they were the best she'd ever had!  Finally, the saganaki...it was perfectly sour and pungent with fresh-squeezed lemon on top it made for a hot, delicious, crispy bite.  The horiatiki salad was not exactly what we had expected (no lettuce), as it was a combination of vegetables like tomato, cucumber, onions peppers, olives and a huge chunk of feta all covered with a light red wine vinaigrette dressing loaded with oregano.  Delish!  We all shared four dinner entrees...two specials and two off the regular menu.  For specials my mother loved the rack of lamb (tender and juicy, served a perfect medium-rare) and we also had the pork and cheese meatballs over a Greek-spiced tomato-based sauce over the pasta.  On the menu we had the kotopoulo sto fourno which were boneless pan roasted chicken thighs served with an incredibly tangy lemon, garlic and oregano sauce accompanied by perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes and braised greens.  Lastly my wife had the lavraki which was a pan seared sea bass served over vegetables which had a wonderful briny taste due to the olives and sauce.  Everyone fell in love with that fish dish.  If all that was not enough (hey, it's my birthday, let's splurge a little!), for dessert we had a piece of baklava (maybe the best I've ever had) which was not overly syrupy sweet but more like cinnamon as well as the Ekmek custard which was light and creamy (recommended by one of my closest friends).  We came here with relatively mild expectations and were completely blown away by the food and the overall experience.  Well done Taki's...we will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp. This was a great find. We spent the evening in Akron at Kendall Cliffs and wanted to eat afterwards. It was getting pretty late, so we were just going to get pizza. With a group of 9, it is hard to please everyone, and not everyone wanted pizza. I looked on Yelp and Taki's came up as the highest rated in the area. I called and they said they'd take us, even arriving at 9:30 when they closed at 10. They were very nice when we arrived and set up a table outside on their patio. We had food from the kids menu, lamb burgers, pork souvlaki, veggie souvlaki, beef burgers, lamb ribs and baklava. Every person loved their food. One nice touch is that you don't have to choose between salad or fries, you get both! Our waitress was Danielle and she was so nice and patient with our big group of mostly kids. We didn't leave until after 10 and not once did they indicate they were in a rush to close. We really appreciated that. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The waiter took time to explain the menu and we have a wonderful lunch as a result. Prices are reasonable and the food quite delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience High quality food and service. Had the scallops, served on sauteed spinach and artichoke, with rice. I could make a meal of the spinach and artichoke alone.  Delicious. Great appetizers . Our Server was Danielle, she was very informative, and helped explain many of the unique offerings. A difficult choice,  as they all sound wonderful"}
{"text":"In Avon Lake near Cleveland lives a small and wonderful eatery named Taki's. The service from the onset was quick and family friendly. The seating was small but not crowded and was just about right, noise wise.  The gentleman who was at times was fluidly seating people and visiting tables along with an occasional plating was Taki the owner.  Quick and effortlessly, smiling a real genuine grin as if he didn't want to be anywhere else he stopped by and talked to me as if I had visited numerous times before. It was my first time.  The food was spot on. Saganaki was served crisp on the outside and perfectly gooey inside. Octopus was wonderful with a nice char and a large portion.  However the lamb shank  stole the show as it was fall off the bone tender and was enough for 2! The flavor was perfect and it was served over a large orzo portion lightly tossed with a red sauce. It will be a lunch leftover!"}
{"text":"Second time here, thought I should leave a little review! This place looks upscale, but very welcoming. It is great to go out for dinner or celebrate a special occasion. Our server was very nice and attentive. Food was awesome! We started with saganki, because you have to.  I got the Arni youvestsi (lamb and orzo) the lamb fell off the bone, sauce was perfect. My boyfriend got KOTOPOULO STO FOURNO (pan roasted chicken) it was juicy and tender. Wish we could've got dessert, but we did not save room!"}
{"text":"We were seated at a row of tables with bench seating on one side. Sitting on the bench was uncomfortable. Ask for another table if they try to seat you there.  There is also outdoor seating if the weather is nice.  Enjoyed my Moussaka (though the eggplant was a bit tough) and the service was good.  Manager stopped by to check on us as well. I would try them again to see if I have a better experience."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. What a wonderful find in Avon Lake. This location was the hot dog joint Tucky's for a time, and before was a nice open Arabica with a gas fireplace, which was operational and we were lucky to sit next to.  If you like Greek and Mediterranean, you will enjoy Taki's. we went for my dad's birthday. I wanted to have the Saganaki, but they coat the cheese in flour before pan frying. Still, there are lots of gluten free choices and most things can be accommodated. I chose to get the Roka salad, which is discounted with an entree.It was a smaller size salad, but delicious with arugula, shaved fennel, grapes, and glazed walnuts in a honey vinaigrette.  My parents both went for that as well as a small plate of marinated Greek olives.  For our main dishes, dad had the moussaka, which he had wanted for New Years but it is very complicated and time consuming to make.  He really enjoyed it, though it comes out very hot.  Mom had a spaghetti dish with seafood, Greek cheeses and vegetables, and a wine based sauce. She found it delicious.  I had the Kotopoulo Sto Fourno, a boneless pan roasted chicken dish with fingerling potatoes and some kind of cooked greens. Such a wonderful dish. We all had leftovers.  For dessert, I chose the Sokolatina, a flourless chocolate cake with some Mitchell's pistachio ice cream (which is totally yummy, though rich), and dad has the Baklava, which is a huge piece served with vanilla bean ice cream. I wish I could have tried it, it looked so yummy.  Our server was really cool and helpful, and we had a lovely time. I would recommend Taki's to anyone, though on weekends, reservations sound like the best idea, based on our server's descriptions of a Friday night."}
{"text":"I had the pork souvlaki and warm orzo. Everything was tasty, the basil hummous and flatbread came before the food and that was tasty as well. Everything was fresh and fair prices. My only complaint is that there is no gyro on the menu. I googled \"are gyros authentic Greek cuisine\" just be sure and the answers I got were all affirmative."}
{"text":"Came back and still love it here, one of the best places to eat on the west side. Try the dip trio to start, the spicy feta is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Undeterred by its proximity to Pizza Hut, we headed here for \"Adventure Dinner\" after reading an article about restaurants to check out in Cleveland. We were welcomed warmly and scored seats by the fire - perfect for the wintry night.   We started off with olives and flaming cheese which went well with the warm pita and garlic hummus. That cheese! Ooh. Sweet love of all that is sacred, that cheese is divine.   I moved onto the \"velvety\" chicken soup that surprised and delighted with its comforting warmth and sunny brightness. We shared the Lima beans which were little medallions of love in a stew of tomato and spinach. These aren't any tiny, wrinkled, pot pie Lima beans. These are succulent, flavorful giants that coat your palate with creamy richness. We alternated the Limas with roasted fingerling potatoes with fresh herbs and a bright pop of lemon.   We shared the vegan stuffed peppers - roasted red peppers with eggplant, pine nuts, orzo, and love. The flavors didn't need the drizzle of balsamic, but it managed not to get too much in the way.   For dessert, we enjoyed the ekmek- one of the best creations this big blue marble of a planet has ever known. Don't ask questions. Just order it.   Our server, Danielle, provided friendly, knowledgeable, and excellent service. She was patient with our many questions - and made the perfect suggestions. We look forward to many returns!   Opa!"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad to say about Taki's!  From the regular menu items to the specials, everything is wonderful.  Top quality food, amazing service, and just an overall quality experience.  If you are not sure about menu items or ingredients it is okay to ask for clarification.  The servers and bar tenders have never had an issue with questions, and answer without making you feel stupid for asking (EVOO).  Our family likes to come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I'm glad we decided to stop in. I was in sweats and my boyfriend was dressed casual. It looked fancy walking in, but they were very welcoming. Food: fantastic!! I loved the stuffed grapes!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch and was very pleased. I got salmon from the lunch special menu which was wonderfully prepared. Cooked to just the right temperature and the presentation was wonderful. The flavors were bright and exciting. The hummus and pita were delicious, clearly fresh and well flavored.  Our server was polite, prompt and very helpful."}
{"text":"The macaroni is amazing. Don't let the strip mall facade fool you, this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"I've had meals there, meals catered and appetizers at the bar. Seriously the most amazing Greek place I've ever had anywhere. Truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Was visiting this town and checked Yelp to find a spot nearby for dinner. Takis Greek Restaurant had good reviews so we headed there. An excellent  choice!  Place is all pluses ~ Attractive and right sized restaurant. Not too big.. Staff is welcoming and well trained. Menu includes many Greek specialties. Our meal of Pan roasted chicken, fingerling potatoes, arugula salad and Greek ice cream for dessert was nicely prepared and tasted great. The cook knows how to cook..."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here - the first one with my daughter and daughter in law. That experience was great so I brought my husband this time. We had an excellent dinner and summer evening again, dining at Taki's Greek Kitchen. We had the special appetizer (Greek yogurt with an olive in the middle and sun dried tomatoes and pita bread (yummy)). My husband ordered the Ouzo (fab again) and stuffed grape leaves and lamb meat balls. I had the sausage and vege flat bread and everything was delicious. Our waiter Steven was attentive and very courteous. The owner stopped by and was again very courteous and asked about our experience and the menu. We ate at the outdoor patio, which on a summer evening is the best place to be. This is now going to be our favorite Greek restaurant in town. A must visit if you are close (or even if you are not!)"}
{"text":"So the atmosphere was cool, and the outdoor seating was awesome. Had the lamb burger which was phenomenal and the chicken souvlaki which was decent. Why not more stars you ask? The waiter was terrible. Took him forever to come each time and it was only moderately busy. When he did come he acted like he was always in a hurry and was a bit rude, and (this is a huge pet peeve) he was wearing filthy jeans. I'm not talking about these are vintage style or even I spilled something on them. I'm talking, they've been on the floor for a week and I don't like to wash. Grosses me out a bit when the person serving your food is obviously dirty."}
{"text":"I have been in several times during the week with my family. A 4 1/2 but we have had such a nice time here I rounded up.   Great Greek food. The stuffed grape leaves and saganaki are wonderful. We also like the grilled squid ap. not like anything I think you can get anywhere round Cleveland. Large pieces of cut up squid not the small pieces like you find elsewhere. They have a daily special. The wait staff are patient and will answer every question about the menu.    Never came here on the weekend. They always ask if we have a reservation. But have always been seated immediately. It's usually busy. May get crowded on weekends.   Nice outside patio as well."}
{"text":"The food here was on point!!! Great ambiance, great service, better food. I came here for Sweetest Day - he never had saganaki before. He was so impressed!!! !"}
{"text":"There are many Greek restaurants that offer Gyros and standard \"Greek\" food that i like to refer to as Greek festival or carnival food. Takis is not one of them. They offer fine upscale cuisine at casual prices with 5 star service. I lost track of how many times I have made myself comfortable at the the quaint little bar located right by the entrance. The interior is well lit with a fireplace and several bistro type tables lined up ever so symmetrically in the cozy yet small dining room. The spotless stainless steel kitchen is open and is the focal point of Takis. I tried the lamb burger and pork tenderloin sandwich both cooked medium temperature. They were so delicious. The sandwiches are served with some of the best mealy centered and crisp exterior french fries and a salad on a rectangular plate with the sandwich in the middle. The salad was dressed to perfection with some sort of lemon dressing, dill, mint and shredded romaine and other lettuces. Very simple but fresh ans was a pleasant palate cleanser to the nicely salted fries. Now to the sandwiches. That pork pita sandwich was to die for. Tender slices of pork stuffed in a warm pita with cucumber and yogurt. Almost like a gyro except with perfectly cooked juicy pork loin slices. My bf loved his lamb burger with the tangy feta shards and spicy crisp arugula. He doesn't like \"ethnic\" food and was not happy I dragged him there but then thanked me for finding such a nice place with reasonable prices to grab a quick lunch. My other many visits have been to the bar where I have tried just about every wine from the humble yet satisfying list as well as Ouzos and a relatively large selection of finer scotches too. Thursday nights are Short rib night. The short ribs at Takis are unlike any other short rib presentation I have ever had, and I have had many variations and foodie preparations of short ribs. Takis serves the melt in your mouth braised beef over orzo pasta in a big hot bowl. Almost like eating spaghetti and meatballs except the spaghetti is orzo and the meatballs are buttery rich slabs of short ribs with just the right amount of the tomato broth coating the orzo and enough of that heavenly sauce to dip your short ribs into, even though you don't need any more flavor added to the already flavorful meat. Ahhhh so tender. Now that I just ranted about the short ribs I'll try to remember the other dishes I have tried. The octopus was a hit. Nice warm char and served with a cold salad with fresh olives and roasted potatoes. The skirt steak and frittes are another hit on the happy hour menu. I remember eating a a fish special..... now I remember. It was a sea bass with crispy skin and flaky moist flesh served with wilted greens garbanzo beans and some sort of white wine sauce. It was so good. I am sad to say that I no longer live in Avon or even Ohio anymore but I miss this restaurant so bad. The only other Greek restaurant that I have been to that compares to the food at Takis is either Grecios (sp), which is extremely expensive, in the Meat Packing District in NYC or Greece when I went on vacation and had warm charred pita and grilled octopus on the beach. Takis was a nice charm tucked away in Avon Lake. I sure hope the locals go there as much as I did because I miss my nights enjoying good company, drinks, and food at Takis. Carl the bartender was very hospitable as well as Taki the owner. I never got to enjoy the patio because I have always dined during the winters."}
{"text":"Finally got to visit the Greek kitchen after a lot of recommendations. The interior is cozy. Being a weekday we were seated immediately. The service is efficient. Complementary hummus and pita were very fresh and tasty. The prices are reasonable for the portion size. The chocolate martini sokolatina was refreshing. The food was served hot. The koutopoulo soukvlaki was a pita sandwich with a side of salad with dill and French fries. The pita sandwich could have been a little moist and spicy.  Kotopoulo sto fourno is made of a bed of cooked green leaves and fingerling boiled potatoes with 2 thigh pieces of boneless chicken. Obviously it's not white meat and the server made us aware of that. It was a little too lemony. What matters is that by the end of it we were stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Perfectly authentic Greek restaurant with a cozy feel! I love everything I have tried-- the lamb is super tender and falls right off the bone. The dips are some of the best I have ever had and I love the grape leaves. Everything is super flavorful with just the right amount of spices, especially if you love garlic and lemon like me :) The menu has plenty of options (same with the wines.)   They are open for lunch and dinner. You can't go wrong with anything here! It is right near my house and have already been here a couple of time so I plan on frequenting and trying more!!!"}
{"text":"Great evening at Taki. Wonderful menu and the food was great. Went to dinner with two other couples without reservations. The owner kept us updated on the progress of our table . The bar scene although small was cozy and vibrant. We shared various appetizers which were great. Chicken meatballs, calmari and a Greek salad which were all very good. Our waitress recommended the pasta special which I loved. Others had the lamb and Greek lasagna. All in all an A plus rating ."}
{"text":"After reading good reviews I decided to check the place out. I was disappointed. I didn't really find anything on the menu that caught my attention or stood out to me. I ended up ordering the chicken pita with tomateos, onions and tazkai. The sandwich was messy and a pain in the butt to eat. It's liked they slapped the ingridents together and didn't care. Tomateos were falling out both sides, and tazkai was dripping over everything. The chicken was cut into HUGE pieces. You think they could figure out a way to roll that up better. It was also so bland. It was definitely missing a seasoning or some ingredient to me. Just absolutely no flavor going with it. I ended up adding my small salad that came with the meal to pita to try and give it more flavor. The fries were so salty I couldn't even eat them. Maybe the entrees are better, but the sandwich just didn't impress"}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood place for us. We've eaten here several times, never been disappointed. Mediterranean food. My favorite is the grilled octopus salad. Everything is good."}
{"text":"Found this place by search yelp and remembered it came highly recommended from a Greek friend. Went in here looking for some lunch vegan food options to go... They had several options. The mgmt was very friendly and helpful in selecting popular/customer favs. I reviewed my food quickly. The music was authentic with a cool calm atmosphere & the patio looked like a nice place to sit.   The food tasted good... I got the stuffed peppers. It was only one pepper and thought the prices was a but steep for the amount if food. Although tasty, because if price per quantity I would not frequent here too often. It's a great special destination event place."}
{"text":"Very good food and fabulous service. Their lamb burger and roasted lamb are two dishes to kill for. The ambience is fantastic and the folks there really make you feel welcome and like you're part of family.  I'd probably say the prices are a little on the higher side, but that's the thing with fine dining I guess."}
{"text":"We're up from Cincinnati and while shopping, opted to stop at Taki's. The reviews looked solid and we hadn't had good Greek food for years. (Cincinnati isn't exactly your hot bed of fine ethnic food.) Taki's didn't disappoint. The calamari was excellent. The lamb shank fell off the bone and was awesome. I had the flat iron steak which was very good. We'll be back for sure the next time we travel to the Cleveland area.  And we'll leave room for dessert!!"}
{"text":"This is now my new go to spot for Greek food. Hubby has been telling me about Taki's so we decided to go- sat outside on the patio which was surprisingly nice and secluded as the location is off of the parking lot but you never once felt like you were-it was really pretty out there. The inside looked great and cozy and I believe they had a beautiful fireplace in the middle too but we just walked straight out back and wasn't really paying much attention. Our waitress was attentive and the food was timed perfectly. We had the stuffed eggplant and dolmades for our app. Now as I am Lebanese and my hubby Egyptian, Mediterranean food is our life. The apps blew us away, so delicious and flavorful. They did bring out a basket of hummus and pita but honestly and I can say this, was nowhere near how I like my hummus and tasted like chickpeas only, no tahini and or seasoning but I'm Lebanese and our hummus pretty much takes the cake and I'm a snob about it. Moving on, I had the sea bass and he had the moussaka, again omg delicious! The moussaka could feed 4 people it was very large. My sea bass was perfectly prepared and beyond bursting with flavor. To end we had to get the Ekmek as it is one of my favorite desserts...fluffy custard, pistachios, whip cream, crunchy sweet syrup base-I die thinking of how amazing this was here, I actually haven't stopped thinking about it since we left...a week ago! It was so big which was a good thing because I couldn't get enough and unfortunately had to share with the hubby...great for my waistline I guess..but I'm already preparing for our next meal there it is now a favorite spot of ours. You definitely should go...seriously...go!"}
{"text":"The lamb chops we had tonight were the best I have ever tasted. Flavorful. Succulent. Tender. Perfectly cooked. I know they just won a competition for the best lamb chops in town. Let me tell you--they deserve it. I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner last night. All I have to say is WOW. We were seated right away. Our waitress was very nice. We started off with the Calamari and I've got to say this was the best Calamari we have EVER had. And we've had a lot. My wife got a Vegan dish she absolutely loved.  I ended up getting the Rib eye which again, was probably one of the best Rib Eyes I've had in a long time. We've been to many places. The steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and had an amazing taste. Each bite of my steak burst open an amazing taste of seasonings and some sort of marinade. It was perfect.  We ended the evening with a desert recommended by our waitress. I don't recall the name of it but it was great. I'm pretty sure anything you get from this place will be amazing. We'll definitely be coming back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"Taki's delivers excellent Greek food in a rather unassuming location.  Starting with the Trio of Dips (the pita bread, while not homemade, is dangerously addictive), through the Mediterranean Sea Bass entree, and Baklava dessert, the food was all very well-prepared and tasted great.  On top of that, the menu as a whole offers a wide variety of authentic Greek cuisine to choose from.  The waitstaff is helpful and very friendly, and there's even a fireplace in the middle of the restaurant to help set the mood.  My only hangup (which may not be important to others) is that you're paying white tablecloth prices for, despite the aforementioned fireplace, a rather ordinary dining room.  The contrast between the food, the prices, and the atmosphere felt so stark that it warranted dropping Taki's from a potenital 4 to a very solid 3-star restaurant."}
{"text":"Mother's Day brunch was the best ever.  Started with trio of dips as they are always excellent. Saganaki was by far the best ever. I decided to try the grilled octopus, WOW! I was pleased and my wife even liked it. She normally doesn't like stuff like that because of the fishy taste. This was not fishy, it was perfect. She had the surf and turf, filet and lobster.  She really enjoyed both. I had the lamb chops and I couldn't help but eating every morsel even off the bone. If I could give 6 stars I would. Thanks Taki for one of the best meals a person could ask for."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice dine-in experience and want some tasty Greek food, I highly suggest Taki's! While I did get my order to-go, staff was very friendly and informative when I called to order and when I came to pick it up I noticed that it was a classy yet lively place. Their prices are a little higher, but it's also not a hole-in-the-wall restaurant.   *Trio of Dips $12  *Dolmades $7  *Spanokopita $8  *Lamb Burger $14  *Ekmek $8   I'd pass on the trio of dips, but everything else was good. I'd definitely order the lamb burger and ekmek dessert again!"}
{"text":"This a great, relatively new restaurant. Lot's of Great Greek food .....but more including Salmon & Steaks. I've had Lamb, Steaks & Salmon...all are are great...especially the Salmon. Lamb is the best I've had in a restaurant in this area. Service is very good. Dolomades are excellant also."}
{"text":"Over priced. Food wasn't great. Some of my food wasn't cooked properly. Not a great place to take kids. Felt I was being rushed."}
{"text":"Great food, nice wine list, surprisingly good service for a new restaurant.  Menu is a good mix  of big plates, small bites and appetizers. We had party of 8 and all were happy.  The Moussaka and the lamb shank were the favorites.  The kid got the lamb burger and loved it !"}
{"text":"Simple but elegant corner kitchen.  The food and service was outstanding.  Calamari and saganaki were great appetizers.  Scallop special, lamb burger, moussaka and other dishes were well done.  And the desserts....the Ekmek was a luscious surprise, and the sokolatina had the table raving. Lots of parking, full bar and excellent hospitality."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant ever no joke! I went with the kids and we are big octopus eaters I am telling you we tried out the octopus and I was blown away!!!! Then to layer the greatness of the octopus I get the lavraki a fish dish and I'm so blown away my 5 year old ordered the lamb burger she ate the entire thing.... Amazing food amazing service amazing atmosphere what more can you ask for, definitely coming back!!!! 100%"}
{"text":"Just went here last evening for my boyfriend's birthday. We went at 5:00 so we were the only people in the restaurant. This suited us just fine as the table section we were sat in was very close together. Ladies, if you have a big purse like me, careful on your way out! You might break a wine glass from a near by table as you're turning to leave....  Our waiter, I wish I could remember his name, was phenomenal. So charming and relaxed. If you get a young gentleman with a shaved head and goatee, you're in luck!  For drinks we tried the greek soda epsa portokalada, an orange soda. It was much more refreshing than we expected. I don't recal the name of the Greek wine I tried, it was very light with a touch of sweet. It was could but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  We had the croquette appetizer. There were three and we wanted six more! It was served over a tomato mousse that was delicious.  My boyfriend had the arni youvetsi (lamb shank). We went to a greek place specifically to satifsy his lamb craving. He really liked it and enjoyed the orzo it was served over, it had a cinnamon-y undertone. His only complaint was the fat he had leftover towards the end, he's not a meat-fat person.  I had the macaronia thalassina which is a shrimp and mussel spaghetti dish. This was absolutely fantastic. I don't think I've ever taken notice to how a noodle was cooked and every bite I thought the noodles were the perfect texture. The shrimp was the right texture. The herbs used were so refreshing combined with the lemon butter. I loved this entree.  So, for two entrees, an appetizer, a glass of wine and soda our bill came out to around $60.  We will more than likely be back to sit on their patio, which does only overlook a parking lot but outdoors nonetheless!"}
{"text":"decided to try Taki's out after hearing and reading really good reviews.  yes, food was super yummy. although we didn't get too crazy, we stuck to the chicken souvlaki (basically chicken in a pita), however it does come with fries sprinkled with a greek like parmesan and a really light refreshing side salad.  we started with the dip trio, which i was really impressed with! you have your choice of 3/5 dips and they were all equally as good! portions are fair sized. the warm pita was super delightful! the plates of other entrees i saw coming out of the kitchen, looked pretty fabulous as well.  although, i had read that this placed looked fancy or upscale, i disagree. i think the decorating inside was just so-so. it is very small inside, but a quiet nice place to go for a quick meal or an authentic greek dinner. our server, danielle was super sweet and very knowledgeable about all of the menu and made some great suggestions.  this place is close to home and i would love to try a few more of their specialties! if your craving some real greek food, check Taki's out. be prepared to ward off any and all vampires. holy garlic!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, from the spicy feta dip (get the trio of dips) to the lamb meatballs and the shrimp baked with orzo and fennel. Danielle, our server, was friendly and helpful; she recommended an excellent Greek wine from the list of whites by the glass."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh Greek food! Taki's was so gracious got us a table at the bar because it was so busy in the restaurant!   The Lamb burger is to die for!!!! Love this place! A must visit. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"ATE MY FINAL MEAL HERE before I left for college. Food was amazing, the bartenders wished me good luck. This was the perfect place to have what might be my last substantial meal before coming home for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"We went to Taki's on opening weekend and loved the food. Surprisingly the service was also very good considering it was the opening weekend. My wife has the marconia (Greek spaghetti) and I had the lamb burger. It was one of the best burger I had."}
{"text":"I was a little worried walking in because the tables were set with fancy water glasses and cloth napkins. We opted to sit outside where it seemed more casual. The patio was surrounded with flowered pots and greenery, making it relaxing and peaceful. You forgot that you are surrounded by parking lot spaces, and you feel as if you're in a private patio garden.  I looked up their menu online before my visit and there were many choices that brought me in. We both chose the Kotopoulo Souvlaki, which was a warm pita stuffed with chicken, red onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce. It came with a side of fries, with crumbled cheese on top of them, and a salad of shredded greens tossed in a vinaigrette and topped with tomatoes.  Our server was helpful and approachable. She was also very attentive.  My visit was a success!! They also have happy hour app and drink specials that I'd be very interested in coming back to check out!"}
{"text":"Come for the AMAZING and authentic Greek food, stay for the awesome patio and drinks!   My girlfriends and I tried Taki's after we shopped ourselves to near dropping at the Avon Lake Summer Market last weekend. If you are a martini kind of person, please try the pear martini or the cretan cosmo -- both are phenomenal. We started with the skordalia (a dip that is pureed potato, garlic, lemon & evoo - very similar to hummus). It was very tasty!  I devoured my yemistes pipieres - which is basically a vegan stuffed pepper dish. Red peppers stuffed with orzo, eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, mint, thyme, balsamic drizz and some oven roasted fingerling potatoes. The taki salad is on the side and the whole thing is two giant thumbs up!   We will be back!! And I can't wait :)"}
{"text":"I don't hand out 5-star reviews often, but I simply could not find fault with Taki's. This is not your typical mom-and-pop Greek joint. The chef has spent time in some jaw-droppingly good kitchens, like La Maisonette in Cincinnati. It shows in the exquisite food, right down to the cut and treatment of the vegetables that graced my monkfish entree. The flavors were balanced, sophisticated, and very memorable. At the same time, it's homey comfort food. I watched my half-Greek brother-in-law practically melt into his seat as he tasted the flavors of his childhood. I should also mention that they easily accommodated his vegan diet. This is very elegant Greek food. Just go."}
{"text":"Taki's was incredible. The food was exquisite and the service was wonderful. It's a tiny place, though so be sure to make reservations. The atmosphere is perfect for date night or a nicer meal with good friends. But, again, the food is to die for - especially the desserts!"}
{"text":"what to say about this place.....it was busy, a very small dining room with an akwardly large fireplace in the middle of the room. decor is average, it doesn't mesh with the style of the open kitchen. it looks like they spent all the money on the really fabulous open kitchen and then pinched pennies for the dining room. the tables were diner style formica tops with a wood boarder topped with plastic mesh placemats. service is lacking in polish. adequate but not upscale professional.  the food......well it is very traditional greek, gladly without the abundance of taboule or hummus that many greek restaurant feel obligated to offer along with the gratuitous gyro. you won't find that stuff here, but you will find a nice, simple array of greek classic dishes like moussaka, souvlaki, baklava, tzatziki, etc.. i had the moussaka, good, but a little lacking in flavor with lots of stringy cheese. the octopus appetizer with disappointing, NOT in the taste, it was the best thing i ate, but the portion. for 10 bucks i got a plate of arugula with 4 1/4' pieces of octopus, hardly enough for a decent taste! i skipped dessert, but my dining partners opted for the baklava served with ice cream.......why? ice cream and baklava, really? the one MAJOR problem with this place is that they run out of menu items. two were out when we were sat, as the night progressed i heard the servers announcing a growing list to other tables. it was good to try once, i'd go back if somebody i knew wanted to try it, but i don't think i'd return on my own....... go try it, it's ok, but not the kind of greek food i'm used to eating. it's good for people who don't know better............like greek festival food, good for people who don't really know good greek food...."}
{"text":"Hidden in Avon lake is this beautiful Greek gem. I ordered the calamari as an appetizer, and let me tell you that was some of the best calamari I've ever had. There was barely any breading and no grease and the flavor it gave was amazing. For entrees we ordered the moussaka and the beef shank and boy were they dynamite. Very very good will be back soon."}
{"text":"Taki's Greek Kitchen is a Cleveland area GEM!  The Greek food served here is truly authentic, and very tasty and memorable.  The ambiance is pleasant (indoors or outside patio), as is the small, open type kitchen.  Taki, the owner, is a great guy and a pleasure to talk to.  You can see him and his excellent crew milling about the place, making sure everyone is satisfied.  This is old world service and caring that is rare today.  The food was fantastic, and then some!  My daughter had a baked chicken dish (made with lemon and spices) with potatos, my wife the pastitsio, and I had about 4 different mouth-watering appetizers to make my own '4 course meal', including the awesome saganaki flaming cheese.  Everything was delicious, and we left happy.  We were so full and satiated, we didn't even order dessert (maybe next time)!  If you enjoy going to some of the area's excellent Greek festivals held by several Greek Orthodox churches, and sampling Greek food there, you owe it to yourself to visit TGK in order to 'take it to the next level'.  It is a cut above festival food, and fresher too.  This was our first visit, and it is safe to say, we will be returning!"}
{"text":"One of the best greek food we tried..we ordered KOTOPOULO STO FOURNO and KOTOPOULO SOUVLAKI and both were superb. Service was also great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Today was my 60th birthday and I searched all over the area for traditional Greek food. This was by far one of the most spectacular Greek menus and meals I have had. I am from a Greek restaurant family from Chicago and spent my childhood in Greece. I am a good candidate to write this. I had the arni youvesti which is a lamb shank with orzo and of course the portion was enough for 3 meals (for most). The shrimp baked dinner was huge and had at least 8-10 shrimp well sized. All the appetizers were fresh and well portioned. Our server Steven was on point and attentive yet had a lot of tables....he did not miss a beat. Even though it is a restaurant with a CHEF - hence the name TAKI- he is the owner,  the prices were very reasonable. Very.   I would recommend this for any meal and for special meals. Dr Gina Makris"}
{"text":"This is a new  little place that has looked busy, busy, busy since it opened. We ate there twice in one week, and I liked it much more than my husband did. The food is flavorful and tasty - I had the pork tenderloin souvlaki with Greek fries and a side salad the first time and a shrimp and orzo salad (added lettuce) the second time. Both were really good, but the shrimp salad had an INSANE amount of red onion that took away from the dish and I had to stop eating after a bit. I would ask for light onion next time and it would be good. Husband had a chicken dish that came with potatoes and greens - the chicken was dark meat (not a fan) and the portions were really small for the price. Entrees should really include a side salad. The pita served with the meals was really soft and delicious. The second time it had a dusting of cinnamon and sugar and came with some apple purée type dipping sauce on the side. I might go back again, but I hope Taki's has much success."}
{"text":"I have visited Taki's many times, and as a vegan, they are very accommodating to a vegan's needs. This is a great place to get good vegan food not too far away from home or hard to get to. Another advantage is that you can bring people who prefer meat.   I have always ordered the Manitryo Ledenia or the Piperia Yemisti when I go, but there are about 4-5 vegan options on the menu. They also serve a new and exciting flavored hummus everyday with warm pita and toasted bread! Yum! The Manitryo is a flatbread with vegan cheese, mushrooms, and some arugula with a truffle oil glaze. The flavors are so good together and it truly is a fancy pizza! The Piperia is a stuffed red pepper with orzo and veggies, and it is warm and flavorful. On the side are fingerling potatoes cooked perfectly and an amazingly fresh salad with tomatoes and balsamic, simple, yet amazing! AND...the portions are amazing and it is very competitively priced. Once you get inside, you will have no idea you are next to a pizza shop and a karate place, the fireplace and ambiance are just peaceful and amazing!   Thanks to somebody for having an amazing, classy restaurant that serves vegan food, and I don't have to worry about somebody ripping the tires off of my car while I am eating.   Tip: Try the Greek candy in the little dish in the vestibule, it is so good!!!"}
{"text":"Always love this place. The moussaka is my go to comfort food. The service and atmosphere are fantastic for this little tucked-away gem."}
{"text":"Aside from gyros, my husband and I have never had Greek food. We stopped here while in town, and it was incredible! My husband had the lamb shank, which was simple, delicious, and fall off the bone. I had the moussaka, which was absolutely fantastic- the perfect comfort food! Add in the quick service, the fact they serve Metaxa (a Greek liquor I can't find anywhere), and that it's a family owned business (the owner stopped by to check on us, as did his father who was dining next to us- you could tell how proud he was of his family), this is definitely a 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wow-- this a gem of a place! The food is amazing, service on point and carry out is perfectly executed.   Tonight we had carry out from Taki's. It was amazing. They did a wonderful job of packing everything nicely and exactly how you would get it in the restaurant. This seems to be a challenge for a lot of places!   We enjoyed a five star meal at home and it was delicious. The chicken souvlaki was so delicious- a sandwich I will be thinking about. And wow, fries that were crunchy and well seasoned in a to-go order? Amazing.   The moussaka was divine. The perfect version of this dish.   The ekmek dessert should NOT be shared. It is so delicious and is a must at this restaurant.   Dining in and happy hour are also wonderful. I have enjoyed dinner with friends and a romantic dinner with my husband here- they just know how to do it all and do it well at Taki's!"}
{"text":"This was first nice Greek restaurant I've been to so I wasn't sure what to expect. There were nine dinner entree's to choose from, and I selected Lavraki (sea bass). I loved my meal; I was really impressed with the atmosphere and the presentation of all the plates the people in my party ordered. Not having any background with Greek food, I wll say I was a bit limited in what looked appealing on the menu, but I am going to give another dish a try and see if it as good as the first."}
{"text":"Excellent, inventive Greek food. There is a lightness and surprise element to the combination of flavors. Our waiter was well-informed and happy to guide us in our choices. And he guided well. I gave it four instead of five stars simply because it's location is in a shopping mall and sitting in the patio you are aware how close the parking lot is. It is a small thing - just go knowing that the outdoor ambience is a little less than perfect. The Food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Finally-- good Greek food in Cleveland!  Scratch that.  GREAT Greek food in Cleveland.    Lemony, ultra-tender calamari, succulent dolomades, heavenly moussaka, a great wine and beer list, knowledgeable service... this place is likely my new favorite restaurant.  The moussaka has  creamy, cheesy bechamel top and a tender eggplant filling.  My husband had a more modern dish-- pasta with seafood and an herbed olive oil dressing.  The mussels were some of the most tender and flavorful I've ever had!  This isn't the greezy gyro joint with pictures of the Acropolis on the wall sort of place.  This is an elegantly furnished, cozy, intimate restaurant that would make a great first date or a lovely romantic night out. There is a fireplace in the center of the dining room, making every table feel private.  It 's completely kitch -free.  In fact, if you just walked in without knowing the menu, the only way you would know that this was a Greek restaurant is the sexy Greek music they play.  And he smell of heavenly Greek food.   I can't wait for the warm weather so that the patio can open!"}
{"text":"Just had Taki's for the first time and I can't wait to go back!! I had the Kotopoulo Souvlaki. The tzatziki was perfect!"}
{"text":"Delicious !! Had the calamari , octopus , gigande beans, lamb meatballs , trio of dip - park souvlaki  All great/ highly recommend .  Nice service"}
{"text":"Fancy looking place, so I was expecting sloppy presentation this early. NOPE! Courteous staff, cleanliness throughout the establishment, the food. Lamb burger was humongy, fries were sprinkled with garlic and very tasty.   Im feelin good now!"}
{"text":"I took my almost mother-in-law out to Takis for her birthday last night. This was my third time there, my fiancé's second and his parents' first. They were definitely impressed! My fiancé and I always order the octopus and saganaki appetizers. The octopus is grilled and has a beautiful char. It's served with a salad of sliced fingerling potatoes, arugula, and an oregano vinegrette. It's the best cooked octopus preparation either of us has ever tasted! That saganaki is a fried cheese that comes to the table on a cast iron pan still sizzling. Add a splash of the lemon the give you and you've got an amazing fried cheese!   His parents got the chicken soup and dolmades appetizer. The soup, his dad said, was better than his mothers! (They're Greek of origin) The dolmades, both said, were incredibly good!  For our entrees, the three others got the moussaka. Let me tell you, the moussaka is HUGE! Enough to serve 3 people per plate! It was so tasty! For mine, I got the seafood pasta topped with fresh dill, cheese, and mussels. It originally came with shrimp as well but the kitchen was kind enough to substitute more mussels for me! The taste was out of this world! Fresh and delicious, the flavors complimented each other nicely without one being too strong.  The staff was friendly, welcoming, and punctual. Our server even took the time to explain the menu to my fiancé's parents. The decor is simple but pretty and the atmosphere makes you feel right at home. The focal point is the amazing open kitchen! It's a small place but soooo well worth it! The chef is formerly from La Maissonette in Cincinnati so you know his menu is perfect! Check them out! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I finally visited Taki's. A shame I waited so long, especially since I live so close. A friend and I had a great time. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is extremely knowledgable of the menu and eager to introduce you to their favorites. We shared a bottle of Greek wine - fantastic and at a great price. The dip trio is a must. The pita is out of this world - never had anything like it. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went to Taki's tonight with two friends. I have been in the past but it has been a year or so.   We got there early, around 5:30 so was not crowded. The special was the Mezza platter with a bottle of wine for $40.  Two of us decided to split this and the third person ordered an orzo salad with shrimp and artichokes.   The Mezza platter was great and definitely enough for two people if not real hungry. I love, love, love the spicy feta dip and that was included on the platter along with dolmade, pork skewers, chicken skewers, olives and spanakopita. Everything was great, the spanakopita was good but was on the sweet side which was a little off putting.   My friend's  salad was perfect, just the right amount of shrimp, artichokes and orzo. She did ask for feta as this was not on the salad and was a great addition so not sure why this isn't included as it made the salad.   Our server was attentive, atmosphere was warm and it was a very pleasant evening.   The food is definitely better than average and such a warm, inviting ambience. It is refreshing to have a place to go that you can have a nice conversation without loud music and noise in the background. Definitely worth seeking out if you are a fan of Greek food."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Greek food and drinks. Their desserts are to die for. Everthing is made fresh in their open kitchen and they have daily specials you have to try!  Each meal includes a complimentary basket of pita wedges and bread with homemade hummus dip.  So good! The calamari appetizer is honestly the best I've ever had.  It's cooked just right, not heavily battered and deep fried til overdone like most other places. The service here is impeccable. The servers are very knowledgeable and always friendly. The decor is very classy and gives the place an upscale look. Taki, the owner, is also very cool.  They have a nice patio for summer time dining, with lively Greek music playing over the speaker.  Definitely check this place out if you love Greek cuisine as much as I do! Trust me, you won't be disappointed! Opa!"}
