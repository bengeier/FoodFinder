{"text":"The food is halal, perfectly seasoned, and beyond delicious! Service is good but they are a bit skimpy on their toppings. Atmosphere is decent."}
{"text":"Slightly above average pricing when compared to other typical Hakka style food but overall great food and service"}
{"text":"Good food and nice quantity! However the two dishes chilli chicken and manchurian taste same. They need to change manchurian a bit."}

{"text":"I used to be a regular here, untill I saw a few cockroaches on the wall, found out later that the cleaners next door were infested.  The final straw was upon my return, (thought I'd give them a chance at redemption) as I had told Darryl the owner what his ex-neighbor had said about the roach infestation.  Darryl told me that the last time I was there, I didn't pay! Which was about 4 months previous?! What? I said.  He then proceeded to double charge me for my order! Suffice to say, I have never and will never return to your roach infested hole! Your insistence on 7.90$ cost you 790$ had I continued to eat there! Try hakka legend , much better service and food!  Suck it! Hakka village!"}
{"text":"In the neighbourhood and wanted to have a sit down lunch rather than a quick serve and this place close by. 

After lunch on a Sunday and still a few tables occupied as we were expecting an empty restaurant.  The two girls in duty were quick to make us seat give us a menu, serve us water and was back to take orders in a couple of minutes. 

Ordered a Veggie Manchurian and a Veggie Fried Rice. The steamed rice was included with the Veggie Manchurian. Requested that there be no or very little oil for the dishes. The dishes were out of the kitchen within a couple of minutes - literally. As if they knew what we were going to order and had them ready!

The Manchurian was quite good actually and the pakoras were crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked inside. The sauce had a perfect blend was spicing and seasonings. The rice was OK. It seemed like the request for oil was not heeded or this was the low oil version - which was too much for us. 

The price of food compared to the atmosphere (was meh!) was high."}
{"text":"Great lunch special, 6.50 and you get soup, spring roll or pop. Would recommend the Chili  chicken"}
{"text":"So last I ordered Hakka was from Hakka at hurontario Street. I got chicken fried rice, paneer Manchurian, gobhi (cauliflower) Manchurian, Singapore noodles, spring rolls and cashew chicken. 

Let me start by saying the restaurant was jam packed, so I thought the good must be good, but the food was average at best. There was nothing special. The flavors were subtle, where as Hakka good is bursting with flavors. 

The rice was undercooked I think, as it was more chewy than I would have looked. The spring rolls were nice and crisp with vegetable filling. Not oily at all. 

The cashew chicken was the best with black bean sauce right amount of heat. Noodles were kind of OK with very less amount of veggies and chicken in it. 

I think of there add more flavor to the dishes, e.g. garlic spices etc they would be one of the best as there only thing missing was the flavors. 

It's on a shady looking strip mall, ambience is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We were craving some Authentic Hakkah food. We couldn't find a restaurant that served both Hakkah food and alcohol in the area except this one. Didn't come in with many expectations but once we arrived we saw how pleasantly packed it was. The service was good. The food came fast, was fresh and tasted absolutely delicious. We got the Manchurian Vegetable Fried Rice, Spicy beef and Manchurian Chicken with gravy. The drinks along with the food were priced very well. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone craving some good prices authentic Hakkah Food."}
{"text":"Decent looking place but the food is outstanding! I was really surprised, I wasn't expecting the food to be that good considering the look of the place. 
I sure hope they upgrade their interior or move to a new location."}
{"text":"Hakka Village is not at all a bad place to eat a quick and inexpensive meal. That's what you should expect. I usually have chilli chicken or sweet n sour chicken with fried Hakka rice. I would say it is tasty and the portions are large enough to feed two people. Don't have any complaints. 4/5"}
{"text":"Two & a half stars. 

I keep hoping there is food life in suburbia. A girl can remain hopeful, right? Tonight I was on a suburbia hakka hunt and I figured Brampton was as good a place as any to look for some hakka since it has a fairly ethnic population. So I hit up the Hakka Village on a very dicey area on Kennedy Road. As a matter of fact there was a bit of a police raid in the plaza where the restaurant was located. Okie dokie. On to the food. 

We went with dishes I have already tried in some other hakka hot spots since they are the line by which all else is to be measured. I ordered the ginger chicken and the crispy beef, some noodles and a hakka fried rice. The crispy beef was on par with what I had before but after that it was all downhill. The beef was sticky and slightly sweet and I liked this a lot. The ginger chicken was gloopy (official culinary terminology) and not really very gingery. The noodles were bland and rice could have come right off the steam table at the Mandarin. The restaurant is non descript and the guy cooking was also doing the serving. Good thing there was only a couple of other people in the place the whole we were there. 

The upside is that this place was cheap, cheap, cheap. A couple of Kingfishers and the food came out to $35 bucks, with some leftovers to go. 

My search for really decent phone in suburbia continues. Fire up the GPS. On to the next spot."}
{"text":"If your craving Hakka this place is alright but it's so hard for me to compare to my favorite Hakka restaurant for quality and taste and prices 
Anyways this place ain't bad it's decent and the server was nice ."}
{"text":"Love hakka! This restaurant is great. Fast service, the guy at the front counter was nice, and the food was delish!"}
{"text":"I'm beginning to get really fed up with writing great reviews for restaurants. It's getting really hard to find a restaurant that appreciates their customers and is consistent in customer service.

I ordered my usual favourites from this place last week. I placed an order for pick up. Lady on the phone told me my order would be $55, which is the usual price, but said that if I pay cash I will receive 5% off. 

What?!? Why was this never mentioned to me before and what place does this? Seemed very sketchy. I didn't have time to stop by a bank so I was okay with paying my usual price. 

When my husband got there she told him the bill was $60? How can you say one thing on the phone and then a different thing when you show up? What if I didn't have the extra $5? What kind of a sketchy place is this? And how rude are they? They know us as repeating customers, as we usually eat here once a month.

My husband asked her why the price change and she said that she only gave me an estimate on the phone? Really? I've never heard of restaurants giving estimates on the phone? Who are you fooling? Then she mentioned the minimum wage hike? Um okay, no problem.. you should mention to customers that the prices have changed when they order.

My husband also told her that his wife gave this place a fabulous review and all she could do is bow her head.. The right thing for you to have done is because you were in the wrong and inconsistent with your lies is to let it slide and charge us the price that was given in the phone. That's customer service! 

I would have stayed loyal but now I will venture out to try some other places.. typical example of how customer service is not prevalent in this day in age. All this over your sketchiness to get an extra $5."}
{"text":"Its Friday night in Brampton, i have a six pack of Heineken at home and i am thinking i want something spicy. Ohhhh yessssss, its Hakka time! I was told about this spot by some Punjabi fellows and they usually know what the deal is when it comes to Hakka. So i ordered Crispy Beef, Hakka Chow Mien and Lollipop Chicken.  The crispy beef was alittle over done for my liking. however it was a hit with my guests, the Lollipop chicken (while not Lollipop looking) were tasty chicken wings in masala spices, the chow mein mien was the star of the show in my opinion."}
{"text":"HALAL

For years now my family and I have been visiting this place and there is one great thing: their quality has not changed over the years! There aren't a lot of Halal restaurants you can say that about. I have seen places that start off great but then quality goes down after a year or two. This place, has been the same great taste for years now. 

We have sat and ate as well as taken food to go. Their staff is friendly and their service is great. The food is amazing as stated before. The quality and quantity has not changed and is great in both respects. It's not a restaurant with great atmosphere or ambiance but there are a lot of tables for sit ins. 

Definitely try the crispy beef and fish pakoras!"}
