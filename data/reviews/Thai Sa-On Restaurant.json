{"text":"Best Thai food I have had since Thailand! Brings back great memories"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Thai place in the city.  Search no further. The food here is spectacular. We love spicy food and it never disappoints. There are a few dishes that we never pass up - the drunken beef and the cashew chicken (cashew chicken not so spicy, but still great and evens everything out) and the coconut rice - don't get me started, I could eat and eat and eat.  Any Thai Sa-On virgins that we have brought out for dinner has fallen in love and has gone back for more."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful and authentic. I love Thai food and had it all over the world, but this was a unique experience: Great ambience, excellent decor, friendly, courteous, and speedy staff; tasteful, delectable food.  As a healthy vegetarian, I greatly appreciate the separate page in the menu. We had the green curry and rama curry. The tofu was great, and surprisingly NOT fried.  thanks"}
{"text":"This was a delicious spot for a quick, relaxing dinner. The service was fast and attentive and the menu is extensive. The food was really great, especially since it arrived at the table so quickly. The interior has lots of interesting decor to look at and it is fairly welcoming. I look forward to going back to try out some other menu items."}
{"text":"I love this place. Works for lunch, take-out or a nice little dinner date spot. Food is absolutely perfect every time, the service is friendly and I love asking for their recommendations to try something new. They've never let me down. Lots of unique artwork inside makes for an authentic atmosphere. LOVE IT HERE"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try for dinner. I absolutely love Thai food so we googled 'Best Thai Restaurants in Calgary'.   This restaurant was the first on the list so away we went.  Easy to find, ample parking. The staff seated us promptly and were very friendly.  Drinks and menus were brought quickly.  We ordered the appetizer platter the Royal Thai Sa-On which had 2 of each of the following: KRA THONG THONG Royal deep fried mini basket crepes topped with ground pork, chicken and corns. SHAW UONG: A purple flower-like traditional Thai dumpling stuffed with ground pork and chicken. SAKUNA SHOM SUAN: Royal style deep fried, bird-like Thai shrimps. PAU PIA TOD: Thai Sa-on deep fried spring rolls with ground pork, silver noodles, carrot, onion, and egg. THONG MUAN YAD SAI: Deep fried stuffed and marinated ground pork rolls. SATAY: chicken, topped with house peanut sauce.  We enjoyed everything, with the exception of the purple flower appetizer, it was a little squishy in texture, just not to our taste.  I also had the I had the soup TAM YAM PUG: Spicy and sour vegetable soup with lemon grass, galanga and kaffir-lime leaves. It was delicious, very refreshing, a nice hint of spice and flavour.  My partner ordered the KEE MOA NUA: Drunken beef with roasted chili paste, chili and cooking wine and GOONG MA KHAM: Shrimps in tamarind sauce with cashews, onions, carrots & green peppers. He has never had Thai food before, he ate nearly all of it and thoroughly enjoyed it.   I ordered KANG KIEW WAN GOONG: Shrimps in green curry coconut milk sauce with zucchini and green peppers. It had a perfect balance of vegetables, flavour-rich sauce and mixed with the coconut rice, an absolute win.  Prices were very good, beautiful decor, very clean and great ambience.  Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Second meal here and fantastic food again. Best Thai food I have ever had and it is one of my favourite things. One of Calgary's beat restaurants. The service isn't overly attentive so make sure you have everything you need when they come to you."}
{"text":"This is my wife and my favorite Thai restaurant in calgary. We've tried other Thai restaurants in the city and always come back to Thai Sa-on. They have great food, great wine and great service. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Raging mad after our last visit...arrived to a quiet restaurant around 8pm, two of us were sat at a table for two between two HUGE dinner parties of 6+.  We sat at the table for 15 minutes without ANY interaction of wait staff.  Got up and left, nobody even noticed that we were leaving, only about 15 tables full in the entire restaurant on a Friday night (had missed the rush).    Went to Thanh Long Noodle House instead-best Vietnamese in the city and unbeatable customer service."}
{"text":"My wife and I were vacationing in Calgary and found this place on yelp. We visited on a Thursday evening and it was nearly empty, but we ended up really enjoying our experience. Our waitress was very friendly and engaging. I was interested in trying one of their curry dishes, but was hesitant to order it as my main dish. Our waitress proactively offered to bring me a sample of the dish to try and I ended up ordering it. I ended up really enjoying my dish and my wife enjoyed her pad see ew as well. My wife and I still reference this place when visiting thai restaurants at home. Definitely would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple times and unfortunately both of my experiences were very disappointing. First off, the restaurant only has 2-3 people working on a Saturday night ( pretty sure my waitress was also washing the dishes in the kitchen). Expect to sit for at least 15 mins before you are even acknowledged. Half the items my friends and I ordered from their menu were \"sold out\". It takes approximately 35-60 mins to get your food - I wish I was joking, but make sure you eat before you go because you will most certainly be waiting for a LONG time!! Food is bland, diluted, and portion sizes are TINY!!!!!! This place is WAY too expensive - not sure how they are getting away with it! Stick to Thai Express.. im serious!"}
{"text":"We had a large group for lunch. It took over 30 minutes for a server to even come by. One of the guests didn't even get to eat as it took too long to even get a drink. Once we finally got service my dish never came. The server did not care at all or try to fix the problem. Just handed me the menu and said sorry. This place has gone waaaaaay down. What was once a place I loved to frequent has now become a place I will never come to again. At least there was some rice to eat. It's sad to see a great establishment lose its way."}
{"text":"Tried this beautiful restaurant for the first time on my birthday. I brought some family that had never tried Thai food (and a birthday is a great way to get people to try something they might not want to) The decor was cool and the staff made us feel very welcome.   We were all pleasantly surprised at the amount of gluten free options and vegan options, but it was the chicken dishes with the coconut rice that blew our minds! Plus, the family tried something new and they truly loved it. The great reviews brought us here they were right! I don't regret a thing.   The one thing is the servers are spread pretty thin. I would say they are definitely understaffed but still I'm sure we will be returning very soon. My mouth is already drooling."}
{"text":"Amazing! We had dinner here on Saturday night around 7pm. The place was not too full and we got a table right away near the back of the restaurant. The restaurant is nicely decorated and quiet enough for a good date night. Our server was very friendly and helpful and brought us drinks quickly. We ordered Pad Thai and Panang Curry. After a not too long wait the food arrived and it was PERFECT. The Pad Thai had the most amazing sauce and it was somehow rich and thick and light all at the same time. The Panang curry was incredible as well and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. I will be going back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food that tastes fairly authentic, but not quite the same as in Thailand (not quite their fault)!  5 stars to the coconut rice - could eat it without any accompanying curry, it is so creamy and fluffy at the same time!  Some dishes are better than others, but the tom kha gai and larb are not to be missed.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying more dishes soon!"}
{"text":"wonderful service. beautiful atmosphere. fantastic food, worth the price! A perfect balance of flavours. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for takeout on my way home from work because I had a craving for pad thai.  This place was on the way, so I thought why not.  Pros: Entered the restaurant and got to order right away Order came out quickly Semi-friendly service Interesting decor inside  Cons: A little pricey for the serving you get (I've paid $4 less for pad thai that was double the serving and tasted A LOT better) Order came out quickly Pad thai was dry, really dry (so I am guessing they pre-make a bunch and it just sits there for hours)  I most likely won't be back again unless a group of people want to go, then I will try something different."}
{"text":"I don't know what was worse... The food or service. Didn't even get water and our drinks came at the end of our meal which we waited over 30 Mins to come. The guy even said to me halfway through I'm bringing your drink but I don't like makimg Thai iced tea. Ordered veg entrees... Basically noddles with frozen mixed vegetables thrown in.  Restaurant was empty... Not surprised."}
{"text":"Wow I think i just had some of the best Thai food I have ever had in Calgary! A friend and I recently had the opportunity to drop in for lunch at this litte gem of a restaurant and i can't wait to go back again.   We were both intent on catching up and did not have time to pour over the extensive menu - since we are both pretty adventurous we put our faith in the waiter and the chef and so we asked for spring rolls and whatever beef and chicken dish they reccommended that wasn't too spicy. We  took our chances and boy did it pay off!   The dishes came out promptly and we enjoyed a wonderful chicken peanut curry dish and a very fragrant beef dish that was loaded with fragrant tasty thai basil and really wonderful! For dessert we indulged in fried bananas and mangos and ice cream the perfect end to a great lunch!   The food was fresh, tastely and piping hot and the service was spot on,  my only regret is that I could not have spent more time exploring the menu next time will definitely be for a more leisurely dinner."}
{"text":"Everyone knows good Thai food when they taste it -- whether you've been to Thailand or not.  When the base ingredients include coconut, lime, kaffir lime leaves & other Thai herbs, you know when they've been perfectly done right together because your mouth can't believe what it's tasting.  I've been to this restaurant many a time over many a year. I've sampled others' dishes and enjoyed their red curry, Pad Thai, Tom soups and what not. But it's their green curry coconut chicken dish that makes my taste buds tremble with anticipation. I literally cannot NOT have this dish when I go. I used to protest myself each time thinking that maybe, just maybe, I could attempt to further my palette. But the green curry coconut would not have it. And I was never sorry to give my soul over to it.  Drama aside, the atmosphere is a little formal but otherwise pleasant and the service has always been pretty good and congenial.  The menu is huge (!) and you won't be disappointed. Not sure what to order? Let Jackie Chan help you. He went here while filming Shanghai Noon. Don't believe me? You will when you see his picture on the wall and items in the menu letting you know exactly what Jackie would order if he were you. Hmmm, but until Jackie gets a Yelp account, maybe just follow my recommendation and don't miss the green coconut curry."}
{"text":"Love love love. Lived in Thailand for a few years and it's nice to get authentic Thai food here in Calgary. Takes me back to SE Asia. Wonderful place"}
{"text":"The most authentic Thai food I've found in Calgary.  Excellent service from genuinely friendly ownership.  Love the drunken beef!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for years through my colleagues and finally got to experience it firsthand.  Sammy is quite the host!  We let him pick our food and wine.  The two dishes that really stuck out for me were the beef jerky and drunken chicken.  I actually can't find the beef jerky on their online menu but that's what we called it.  The wine he brought over was a Didier Dagueneau Blanc Fume de Pouilly which had very good minerality and acidity balanced with fruit.  It went very well with the food.  I've heard the stuffed chicken wings are to die for.  Next time..."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced for the portion size. Embarrassingly mediocre food to boot. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Ambiance & Great People!  The food was unbelievably awesome!  We didn't want to stop eating.  My son has some allergies and they were friendly, thoughtful and careful for us.  We had 3 different dishes (including a vegetable/vegan) and all were so great that I wish I had recipes!!!"}
{"text":"Worst pad thai I have ever tasted in my life, small portion and over priced. The pad thai was dry, super dry with no flavor. Yellow curry was bland and again small portion. Coconut rice was dry, made from the cheapeast rice you can find in TnT. I really don't understand how people gives this place 5 stars. An appie, pad thai, curry and rice for $54 that doesn't even fill 2 people. I've had much more expensive Thai's food and let just say it's not about money. The food was grossed. For the quality and quantity you get, this deserve 0 star at all."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai green curry with chicken,  the Drunken Noodles with beef, and a pork basil stir-fry. Had stuffed chicken wings and papaya salad to start. And of course, coconut rice all around. This place had great Ambiance and service was fairly good, although the drink orders took a little while. The green curry was one of the best I've had in the city, which means it had the right consistency. The pad thai my friend ordered was also excellent. The noodles were thin the way I like them and cooked just right. Definitely a bit pricier than most other Thai places in the city but overall worth it. I'd say the Drunken Noodles are a must try."}
{"text":"This place is terrible ordered for 2 ended up getting curry had no chicken and smallest portion. Also ordered pad Thai was bland with no taste and very dry. The rice had no coco it flavour and was cheap rice can tell by the taste. Also ordered these bird shrimp rolls so tiny and dry. Overall the food was terrible small portions and no care put into the food. People in Calgary do not know what quality food is. This place is a disappointment go try white elephant or khao san if you want quality Thai food. Steer clear of this place tonight was a disappointment."}
{"text":"the most authentic Thai food in Calgary with great service and a phenomenal wine list. Swimming Rama Shrimp, Deep Fried Tofu, Masaman Beef. Make sure you try this place. It's better than King and I or Chili Thai House. Just ate at Thai Sa On tonight and it was as excellent as always."}
{"text":"Well this is definitely one of the most decorated thai restaurants I've ever been to. There are Buddha paintings and sculptures throughout the whole restaurant.  There's a picture of when Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson ate at the restaurant when filming Shanghai Noon.   Alright for the actual food review. The tom yum soup is amazing; it was light and refreshing with lots of flavor. Definitely very authentic. I ordered the yellow chicken curry as my meal. It was great and it comes with either white rice or coconut rice.  There was enough for two meals but I'm on a business trip with no fridge in the hotel so I decided to overeat.   Bottom line: if it's good enough for Jackie, it's good enough for me."}
{"text":"The ambience is cozy and romantic. Extensive menu options. Service is friendly. The red curry tofu dish was tasty. A tad big salty. The tofu is steamed and was very soft. The basil fried rice was adequately spicy and probably the best dish of all. The drunken chicken dish was equally tasty with a unique blend of wine with Thai spices. Prices are $14.95-$16.95 per dish. I would definitely revisit. Ask for the chilli oil paste for added spice level."}
{"text":"I remember going to Thai Sa-On back in 2006 and the food was great.  So I went back again last week and was disappointed.  Ordered some coconut rice, a chicken dish with peanut sauce, Pad Thai, a grilled beef dish and a bowl of tom yum soup.  One of the first things that stuck out to me was how quick the chicken, rice and padthai came out to our table.  I would say it took less than 10 minutes.  I'm not saying it's bad but it's a bit weird, especially when the food that came out was lukewarm.  Even the rice wasn't hot enough.  I would highly suggest for them to serve their food on warm plates/dishes to keep the temperatures.  The food didn't feel as if it came off a hot pan or pot.  It didn't have the same consistency as when you cook something on the stove.    Second.  It's a shame to see such a good place go downhill because they have a really crappy menu design.  Wrong spellings, and scratched out prices to put the new ones in etc.  Really cheap feel when you notice the menus were printed from Microsoft Word and an inkjet printer with cheesy clip art headings.  Especially when you're paying 50/60/70 dollars for a meal for 2.  Each dish we ordered was about $14.95 plus the rice and the soup.   It was also a bit confusing because some items were not labelled properly.    Third.  This is just my opinion on a personal level now.  I feel that Thai Sa-On should trim down their menu items and really concentrate on making really good food.  They don't need 100+ items on the menu.  I feel you can get rid of over half that menu, cook some really delicious traditional and FRESH Thai dishes and people would definitely come back for more.    My bill came to about 66 dollars that night for 2 of us.  I would say the value is not there anymore.  The food was not up to par and I think other Thai places in Calgary would be better choices."}
{"text":"I went there during lunch time with a friend and the place was packed (but not totally full) with lunch crowd from nearby offices.  We got seated but it took another 10 minutes for water to come and another 15 minutes for the server to come by to take our orders.  This place seriously lacks serving staff during lunch.  Once our orders were in it only took less than 10 minutes for our food to arrive, which is quite strange with the number of tables on hand and their slow service.  My conclusion is that a lot of things on their menu are pre-made and just sits around for hours at a time until someone orders them.  Our pad thai came out dry and doesn't have the freshly made feel (no sense that it came out from a wok).  Our curry dish was nothing special either.    For the prices that this price was charging, I expected the food to be much better than this.  There are many many Thai places around town that are better.  Service was non existent.  Our water was never refilled.  This is not a place I recommend... at least not during lunch hour.  Maybe this place is good for dinner (with all the positive reviews) but I do not intend to come back and find out."}
{"text":"I was in Calgary in December, and within the frosted city, Thai Sa-On serves as a warm haven of delicious Thai cuisine. Most importantly, the warmth comes not only in the form of great food, but also in the form of a warm welcome and friendly attitude.  I'll start with the food. We ordered 4 dishes: the kao pad ka pao (basil fried rice), kao pad prik kang (red curry), kang kiew wan kai (yellow curry), and Jackie Chan's favorite beef dish (ask the manager, and he'll tell you). In addition to the coconut rice we ordered on the side, everything was delectable. The portion sizes are what you'd expect for Thai food (relatively large); for my group of 6 people I was in, what we ordered was just the right amount.  The restaurant itself is quite clean, well decorated, and comfortably lit. No negatives there.  On to the service. Maybe it was because of the -10 degree celsius temperature that day, or the fact that it was Boxing Day across Canada, but we were the only group in the restaurant at around 6:00PM. Whatever the case may be, the manager gave us his full attention. Not only was he attentive, he was also extremely friendly, and we had a lengthy conversation about the differences between America and Canada (as he sees it), his experiences living amongst Canadians (he's from Thailand) for the past several decades, and even about Jackie Chan's kung fu skills vs. two of his contemporaries'. Mind you, the food didn't come out any slower as a result, even though he did take a bit longer to take our orders, since he clearly enjoys conversing with his patrons.  If you ever find yourself in Calgary, regardless of whether it's under frigid circumstances, I highly, highly recommend giving this place a try. The food is delicious, and the manager is one of the most gracious, friendliest mangers I've ever met (he gave us the coconut rice for free!), and I'm usually not the talkative kind when it comes to dining at restaurants. In my mind, this place deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Had a business related dinner with a customer here last night.... we literally walked in, sat down, and said \"we'd like some nice red wine to go with your best chicken, beef, and shrimp dish\". Left it up to the owner Sam to pick for us and wow was it amazing!! Great hidden gem! :)"}
{"text":"Kind of wanted Thai food after a lunch buddy was talking about it today. Ended up here and while it was ok, it wasn't that really good food that you crave more of. On top of that I found it pretty expensive. An appetizer, curry, and two beers were $40. It'd be one thing if I had a vat of curry to take home but the portions I thought were too small for the price.  I got the Thai dumplings as an appetizer. There were pretty good although seemed a little under cooked (steamed) in places (read: overly doughy). I got a chicken curry based in coconut milk and passed on the coconut rice because I thought it would be too much coconut. Maybe they overcompensate the curry for people ordering coconut rice because there wasn't that richness of coconut flavor I was expecting. It was decent curry I'm just not sure I'd be back/I'd rather try a new place.  The service was friendly if a bit slow at first (waited 10 mins to place my food order, but after that very attentive). The decor is all Buddha-large Buddha faces everywhere."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere and Wine Selection, Sam will help you with the selection of Fine wines, The food is the best Thai food in Calgary, I have been to most, there are good restaurants but this one is special, the style and quality and presentation is superb, the whole fish, esp the one with onions, ginger, celery, fish cut into pieces, is my favorite item on the menu, the curries are to die for. Topped with the coconut rice and Thai Iced Tea, only a few true Thai restaurants serve \"Thai iced tea\" made with condensed milk, truly amazing! It's always expensive since I like the most expensive items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food. Service could be a bit faster... but food was delicious and their peanut sauce is incredible!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the city.  The food is absolutely unparalleled, everything I've ever ordered from the menu was top notch!    Thai Sa-On is a great place to go if you need a quick dinner before hitting up an event at the Saddledome or Corral.  Everything comes out so fast (once you've decided out of the gigantic menu), and even though everything is fast you can tell it's all cooked fresh,  Veggies still have texture and all the meat is not at all dry.  I heartily suggest this restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service.  I was dying for Thai food when I was in Calgary, and after a quick Yelp search this restaurant came up. Seeing how I was nearby, I decided to try it out with two of my friends.  The interior is quite dark, be warned. It creates this intimate atmosphere where you would not want your noise level to go higher than a whisper. Oh well, it was a quiet night anyway.  I ordered a pad thai. The order came at around 10 minutes; reasonable for a non-fast food place. The first thing I noticed was that the noodles they used were the extremely thin type, similar to pho. It tasted pretty good, though I rather the wider type of noodles that I usually get in other restaurants.  Service was very good; we were attended to from start to end. It's definitely a place that I would recommend to would-be visitors."}
{"text":"A great Calgary Thai Restaurant in the Belt line.  As a busy Calgary social media consultant I rarely have time to enjoy a quiet dinner.  However on this evening I managed to share dinner with a number of our speakers from the Calgary Mind Over Marketing group and what a wonderful experience.  I highly recommend that if you need a wonderful night out...this is a place to check out.  The servings were just right and the service was great."}
{"text":"One of my favourite hidden gems. This place looks like nothing on the outside but as soon as you step in, it's like you've left the city. Do not judge by the front door!!!  The music, dim lighting and decor are serene and invite you to take your time and relax.  I have never felt rushed here and the servers try to explain the dishes. The heat meter is a good indicator to follow. I like items with a heat factor of 2-3 chilies and usually get 1 item that has no heat to even things out.   The menu is extensive so. It may take you 10-15 min just to get through it all and narrow down your choices. I've had drunken chicken, veggie pad Thai, glass noodles, spring rolls, dumplings, coconut rice, matsuman curry, and seafood. I love it all. The food is tasty and plates are average sized in comparison to other Thai restaurants. Sit back, relax and fill your belly!!!"}
{"text":"4 solid stars for this place!! The food was all great! From the spring rolls to the dessert!! Everything was really good!!! I ordered the coconut soup to start and it was delicious as a main I had the chicken with pineapple and ginger and it was excellent and the dessert, the fried banana with coconut ice cream was great too! I definitely recommend the food of this place!! The wine was not bad, and they have an interesting selection of wines to pick from. The service was good too... I don't have anything to complain about this place ... Even when is not super fancy, the food was so good that I can definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch during the work week. Great service and the food I always good (love their pad Thai!)  The dining room is very large and quiet- perfect for catching up with friends or going for lunch with coworkers (unlike Craft or National you can actually hear what the people at your table are saying, which is a big plus in my books!) Easily one of the best Thai restaurants in yyc!"}
{"text":"What is the hype of this place? I don't get it. Stopped in here for lunch and their pad Thai had over cooked noodles, sauce in desperate need of salt and highly overpriced (18.00) for the 1/2 cup of noodles and ends of greens. I will say the prawns were nice but could not get over the price and taste. Service was poor as well. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Thai Sa-On for ages!  Still the same fantastic Thai food.  We ordered steamed rice, Red Curry Chicken and Beef and Vege with Chili Paste.  Then, came dessert, we had the Deep-fried banana with Coconut Ice cream.  So darn good!    The service suffers a little.  There was only one server in that big restaurant on a busy lunch hour."}
