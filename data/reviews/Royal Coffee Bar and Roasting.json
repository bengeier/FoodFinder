{"text":"I recently went to Royal Coffee Bar to get some work done on my day off. The restaurant is small but small with a very cozy feel. I ordered a Hazelnut Latte and the lemon blueberry scone, and let's just say it was BOMB! I wanted to get them both again while I was there, but I hesitated. The baristas were good and were very involved with the customers and doing small talk with everyone. The place was quiet too, which is different from some of the other coffee shops around Tempe. It's a little bit of a hike from my apartment on the other side of campus, but well worth the walk. I WILL be back here again!   P.S. They play music over the speakers and for a good hour or so they were playing country music (which I despise) but I dealt with it. The great coffee and atmosphere made up for it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pour over I have ever had. Thank you Evan for taking your time and talking to me about the beans and your roasting process. You made my Sunday morning coffee an event I now crave."}
{"text":"I've been a regular of Royal's since they opened and was extremely joyful when they opened near ASU.  The staff is top notch and know you by name if you're a regular;  you can't beat that old school service.    I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I love this place. If you want to drink heaven in a cup... Get the cold brew. Also get a large, you will be so sad to see it end...  The baristas are super nice and normal, they don't greet you with the enthusiasm of pre-teens at a Justin Bieber concert. (Don't act like you don't know which coffee place I'm describing!)  I don't want to get coffee anywhere else ever again."}
{"text":"Perfect coffee, espresso/ pour over/ drip etc, it's all perfect. The atmosphere is on point, the baristas are on point, it's a quaint/relaxing coffee bar. I would certainly consider it to be the best third wave/ speciality coffee roaster in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area, especially if you're looking to escape the dictatorship of the night club, always overly crowded/loud, atmosphere that Cartel Coffee Lab has become."}
{"text":"This is my go-to coffee place when I'm around ASU. Service is great, coffee is great, and prices are just right. My personal favorite drink is the Royal Coke - which is essentially a bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola, vanilla simple syrup and espresso, served over ice. The hours are a bit short, but I've never had an issue with it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to study/get work done! I used to go to Cartel a lot but it was always a little too crowded for me and finding seating was hard. Royal is perfect for a cozy cup while studying and the baristas are always super nice and fun to talk to (CJ is super cool!)."}
{"text":"I love Royal and would have loved nothing more than to grab a cold brew when I am on campus but I have tried multiple times and they are never open. Completely ignore the hours posted on Yelp, they don't mean anything. They were supposed to be open at 8am today (Sunday), I walk up a little before 10am, open the door, wait patiently for the barista to saunter up to me just to tell me they are closed. Seriously?!?!? Please get it together Royal, if you close it won't be due to uninterested customers."}
{"text":"Great coffee, but even better service!  I'm not in college anymore, but this campus location is awesome!  I HIGHLY recommend the honey, vanilla and cinnamon latte - not too sweet, instead just right..."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love grabbing a coffee here before class. The location of this place is great, and it's a little bit cheaper than the other coffee shops in the area. What more could you ask for?  Oh yeah, and as someone who has a dairy allergy, I really appreciate that their pastries are vegan. Typically I can't get treats at other coffee shops, so it's nice to have the option."}
{"text":"An unexpected gem, this was the first time I had cold brewed coffee.  I also enjoyed the service and the fact that my questions were answered without any qualms.   With a bit of milk and some sugar, I had a coffee that gave me enough energy for over 19 hours.  For a person who was struggling with the time difference, it was wonderful. I'm still searching for a cold brewed coffee as strong and as good as this."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the environment. The coffee here is good but I'm not sure it's been the best, or at least in the past two times that I've been here. I love the decor in the place and the atmosphere. There's always someone to just sit and talk with for fun if you're the type of person who's up for it. The last time I was there I got a macchiato and boy was it strong! kept me up for finals though."}
{"text":"This place has great coffee! They also have delicious baked goods. The baristas are very friendly too. I'll be back again, probably to buy coffee beans."}
{"text":"Royal is easily my favorite unique coffee shop in Tempe; the tiny setting is cozy, the huge windows cause the place to feel very bright and open, and the patio is a perfect hangout spot during a nice day. The concrete bricks, wood tables, and huge lights remind me of a New York City style bar, which is a nice change of scenery here in Az. While the prices are a bit on the high end for some of the drinks, you get what you pay for- the Chai Tea here is easily one of the best I've ever had, and their coffees are fantastic as well. Overall, if you're looking for something different, or a great place to do some studying/work, Royal is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Heavenly coffee and a super relaxing vibe... but the gluten free doughnuts really seal the deal on the five-star review. Love!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, a very nice setting near enough to everything ASU but far enough away to not be crazed, and tasty vegan pastries. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Royal! This place serves incredible espresso and coffee drinks. They offer a variety of beverages and are always willing to explain the difference between flavor notes or the difference between espresso and regular coffee. The staff is educated but approachable."}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee bar close to campus. It's convenient for a coffee break whenever I have a break from work, where I can take my laptop and grade some papers with a good environment. I wish they had a bit of a broader drink selection, since one of those terrible people who actually enjoys frappes from Starbucks. However, the staff here is incredibly friendly and accommodating. I asked them for something for my sweet tooth and they made me a mocha with cinnamon and chai in it. It was delicious and different! And I would have never known to ask for it. I've also gotten some of their tea here, over ice. It was delicious. I recommend if you're looking for some quiet away from the buzz of campus."}
{"text":"Super friendly barista, who was more than happy to talk about the beans, the pulls, the equipment, anything.  Fun wall art by local artist - oh and good coffee too.   I'm usually wary about iced coffee and pick about my cold brew, but it was well-done. I also can't drink my coffee black, but for their coffee it was good enough to drink black. Buut, for transparency, I'll admit,  I still added cream.  What? I like half and half."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to Sunday afternoon coffee the other day with my sister but it looks like it's closed on the weekends for the summer.  We came back later in the week and luckily they were open.  The coffee was awesome. I'd give that five stars. It had a great, rich flavor. I got a hazelnut latte. Service brings it down a notch. The barista was using her computer and hanging out with some of the customers the whole time. We had to wait a minute for her to even come to the counter. I came here hoping for a latte in a mug with latte art (as I had seen in so many photos) but it was automatically given to me in a paper cup. It almost seemed like she was more interested in hanging out than working and just wanted us out the door. I was also disappointed that there were no baked goods available when we came in. While the decor is cool, it is a very small space, so it might not be the best for larger groups (4+), especially with how many people were studying. The choice of music was great.  If you want good coffee, come here. If you want a fun atmosphere to hang out and talk, go across the street to The Blend."}
{"text":"Great coffee & a really neat space.  I had a latte that was made expertly.  The staff was very friendly and professional.  Anyone wanting coffee in Tempe at or near ASU should pick this place.  Cartel also has good coffee, but this place is much cleaner and more slick from coffee to service to decor."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm kind of a coffee snob and this place is pretty good in my book! The Americanos are brewed with the best espresso beans."}
{"text":"This is the best espresso in the entire metro area, at the moment."}
{"text":"I've been to the royal coffee near the science center in downtown Phoenix, and I really enjoyed it although, I only got an iced tea at the time because it was so hot outside. I came to the royal coffee today in Tempe as it's right down the street from ASU it was so good!   The barista was really sweet and informative about everything on the menu. I got the cortado, which is essentially a latte served in a big shot glass, the milk was steamed perfectly, and I will day dream of it tomorrow whilst drinking my coffee at home. The barista (who was a really sweet brunette!) recommended a scone that I bought, which had really plump blueberries and real lemon zest, I was in love.... They also had some GF options and milk alternatives, though I don't get any of them, I'm sure they're delicious.   It is a small place, but, I enjoyed it. It's a good place to study or just meet someone and sit outside with. Who needs Starbucks or coffee bean when this place is down college ave?!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop near ASU. I stopped here before a meeting on a chilly morning and they were very friendly in the AM. I didn't get anything special, just a pour over coffee. They did have a bunch of danish that looked tasty, but didn't have the chance to try! But its a great place to meet someone for a hot drink or sit outside on a nice day to relax!"}
{"text":"I didn't believe the 5 star rating (based on 7 reviews) that Royal Coffee had on Yelp, but I was hoping it to be true and thus I started my venture to Royal during my lunch break while I was at ASU main. I passed two other coffee joints to get here and it was worth it!  The two staff members welcomed me with a friendly \"hello\" and smile while I took a quick glimpse at my surroundings. This is an intimate shop (a polite way to say small), but the décor is modern hipster and the open patio is enticing especially now that the Fall weather is cooling down. Standing at the order counter, which is covered in individual health bars, loose tea containers, and two pastry stands, I asked the first of a bazillion questions (okay it was only three, I asked three questions). I wanted to know what kind of milk they offered, the drink sizes they offer, and the amount of shots in each latte size.  As you might have read in my tip, I am so giddy that they offer almond milk. I love almond milk, it makes everything taste better. In addition to that, they have the standard, whole and non fat cow's milk and soy milk. The drink sizes are in English, so you choose from a small, medium, or large and since I wanted a latte, the shots for each size are 1, 2, and 3 for a large.  My drink of choice today was a medium iced carmel latte with almond milk ($4.22 with tax). Now, I am both happy and sad I ordered this as my first drink from here. I'm happy because I haven't had a flavored latte in forever and their carmel sauce (yes I say carmel, not caramel) is a honey, buttery goodness that is worth the extra 40 cent surcharge. I'm sad because since I got a flavor, I can't really taste the espresso, but reading the prior reviews, it's apparently the bees knees, but to be clear, the flavor isn't overwhelming powerful that you lose the coffee taste. Either way, my drink was delicious and I will be back to try it again.  So as I said, their order counter is lined with various goodies and the pastry stands were screaming my name so loud it was annoying and even though I told them they were being rude and to stop, they gave me an ultimatum. I had to buy one or endure the screaming my entire time there. So since I was left with no choice, I tried their banana fritter/donut hole ($1.25) . Oh-em-to-the-gee, it was mouthwatering. The outer glaze melts in your mouth and then the banana hits your taste buds, ugh so good. You must try them!  All their pastries are made Nami -meaning they are all vegan, but don't let that fool you into thinking they won't have any flavor!  I understand why this coffee joint has 5 stars. Great Drinks, Great Food, Amazing Service! And just to add to their awesomeness, they have a frequent flyer punch card (its electronic, you use your email) and every 10th drink you get $3 off!"}
{"text":"Just a typical no frills coffee shop.  They do lattes, expresso and the like.  No ice blended drinks, although you can get your drink cold or over ice."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops around Arizona State University (ASU) and conveniently situated near the light rail and downtown Mill Ave. Their baristas are always very nice when I come here.   Yesterday the barista asked if I wanted a quadruple espresso instead of a double. I declined (it was a very nice gesture I appreciate it!).  They had some music playing in the background so it made the brief visit very enjoyable.  There are metered parking nearby."}
{"text":"Great dirty chai, their espresso is great. I am picky person where I like to go for chai. I actually got my sister to love going there on a regular basis. My kids liked it there. We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I wanted to love or at least highly like this place, but I can't!  I came in on a weekday to get coffee beans because it is very close to the parking structure I use at work.  The space is tiny - I actually had to wait in line outside of the door before making it inside.  The service seemed slow - which is to be expected for single pour over coffees.  This part didn't bother me...but the fact that the person taking orders was also the person making coffee was hard to wrap my head around.  I had to wait for the 5 people in front of me to think out their orders, order, pay, and then have the employee make their orders before I could buy my bag of beans.  This was annoying (as was the conversation of said 5 people that I had to listen to while waiting).  The beans themselves (once brewed at home - using a french press as recommended as well as a chemex) were OK, but definitely not the best bean you can get in Phoenix.  Will stick to Cartel when I need to buy beans close to ASU."}
{"text":"Walked past this coffee shop for almost 7 months. A friend brought me in to try it and it was great. I ordered a iced vanilla latte. The drinks are great.. not much of a choice outside of coffee but it's a great spot. The seating is unique also but could be a great place to study."}
{"text":"Very cool scene with a view of ASU's football stadium. I've been here several times before and the coffee was pretty good, and atmosphere was relaxed. Free WiFi with password. Today I had an iced latte with almond milk and the milk tasted a little like cardboard."}
{"text":"This is a really cute and small coffee shop near ASU. The menu isn't overwhelming, which makes it easy for you to order. In addition to the classic espresso items you see everywhere, they have a selection of teas, including a cactus blossom!! This, I was pretty excited to see, since I always feel as though I can brew my own earl grey/jasmine/chai/etc. at home.   Royal is fairly small and the set up here is fairly simple and neat, and the music is calming to listen to, but not distracting if you like to listen to your own. There aren't very many outlets if you're trying to study with low batteried electronics. If you're trying to read a book or get some non-electronic work done, this place is perfect! With the set up, you get lots of natural AZ sunshine streaming in to make your work day just a little brighter.   My only qualm that keeps this from 5 stars is the lack of restroom int his building directly. And the parking is metered only. Unfortunate, but still worth stopping by otherwise!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. It offers true small coffee house experience.  Not many places offer Real Iced Coffee. This place offers something similar very close. They cold brew their coffee grounds in room temperature water (instead of iced or chilled water) and then serve it under the name of Iced Toddy. It's not bad. The pastries they serve are from a third party and is acceptable.  I had: Iced Toddy (no sugar, no cream) Pumpkin Turnover (kind of stale if you ask me)  But it the coffee's acceptable and the pastry isn't that great, why do I like it? It offers that cozy coffee house feeling, they don't make you feel as if you need to be out of there in ten minutes. Some guy was there, studying, for 5 hours or so. The place is quiet and it's pretty close to campus. The music isn't too loud and there's this huge table for spreading out.  Another thing, the bathroom's a minute walk away on a different floor."}
{"text":"The blueberry/ raisin and fennel biscotti is amazing! The coffee is always wonderful and does not need the extras (milk, sugar) to make it great ... the sign of a genuinely good bean."}
{"text":"It offered ta place to do some homework, but I was ultimately really disappointed with the taste of my iced coffee. I'm really not picky when it comes to my iced coffee, but I found their coffee to be completely tasteless."}
{"text":"If you are in to Hot Chocolate like me then you know it's hard to find a good cup at any Starbucks because frankly their hot chocolate is awful. If you want a solid cup of hot chocolate you are not going to be able to top Royal Coffee Bar's chocolate. Simply put its the best and it is a great place to nerd out on your laptop to get some work done. The people are super nice and know how to make coffee as well as HC."}
{"text":"Damn good cup of coffee. Simple menu, none of that Starbucks foofy stuff. I got an americano and a ballerina cookie, both were great. It being quiet and having good wifi make it a great place to study."}
{"text":"The coffee here is very good and is definitely worth a stop by, but the customer service is lacking so that's why I am giving a 3 star review."}
{"text":"My go to coffee shop near campus. Small and quaint, but with ample indoor/outdoor seating.   Have tried iced/hot lattes, the cortado, pourovers, and cold brew and they were all excellent.   Good selection of gluten free pastries."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee served in a laid back environment made by people who care about their product. Couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have awesome cappuccino and strawberry - chocolate donuts!! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"Coffee was great, ambiance superb, location delightful. Bathroom, terrible. 1/4 mile walk around the corner down the street upstairs shared with other tenants one stall. Line for the men's room?"}
{"text":"To begin with, I am 50 something, so I'm not a hipster, not tattood, I don't have piercings, and I don't go to ASU. I only say that because when I'm writing a review I want to give stars based on the product primarily that I'm coming in to but -- in this case, coffee.  I am recently moved to Arizona, and I find a lot more cool coffee shops here than I did in California where I was from. Lots of local roasters. Lots of really good coffee. So I've been just going to all these different little hole in the wall places based on yelp for reviews, to see what I think. Overall, I've been pretty impressed.  So I'm giving four stars, because it's the first time I went there, and I like to leave a little room for going up or going down.  So to begin with, I had a cappuccino and some kind of oatmeal cookie.  Cappuccino--excellent. Cookie, OMG. I don't know exactly what it was other than some kind of oatmeal cookie with dried fruit or whatever. I don't know if it was vegan I don't know anything about that, but man was it good. Chewy, buttery, oatmealy (if that's a word).    So, the products were excellent. I definitely go again.  If you're going because you want to Starbucks atmosphere, or a place more like that, don't go. Do you want a quiet place to sit and have coffee and visit or read or whatever, go there. Your served by a younger, alternative crowd. People who served me were friendly. Nothing special there.  In short, I'd go again for the coffee and that OMG cookies."}
{"text":"Super cute, economical use of space and the coffee is the real deal.   This cross-country move from Memphis to Carlsbad needed some caffeine - Best Western did their best but... no. Yelp pointed me toward this little darling and I'm so glad!   The barista was friendly, chatty; in my experience baristas are either very friendly or completely merged with their machine. This fellow was the former and pulled an excellent Americano.   Agave and simple syrup at the ready; these are things that make me happy to see and tell me the place knows it's craft.   Also I loved the Damien Hirst piece in the background and the fact that the barista was knowledgeable about the artist and his work. Totally a win."}
{"text":"It's near asu and delicious. Too bad it's all the way on the other side of campus from me. I'm going to be honest though.. I'll walk for 15 minutes to get coffee from here. I just got a Carmel latte and it was delightful. It was also a lot cheaper than I was expecting. I actually had a nice conversation with the barista and he was super nice. I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Small, intimate feel. Quiet, at least during the summer when ASU is on break. This is my first time and I ordered an Earl Grey tea with milk and honey. Barista made it up great with steamed milk and yummy frothy foam. Delicious."}
{"text":"I'm by no means a coffee expert but I love Royal. Overall, a great place to have coffee and study/relax. The baristas are always friendly, the layout of the store is well-designed (inside and outside seating), and the coffee is excellent. Plus, there are always delicious vegan pastries from Nami, a Phoenix bakery."}
{"text":"Oh Royal... I love this place. This location is perfect - right off the light rail and on the way to campus. It's very accessible and the outdoor patio is going to be great for these cooler fall days. The coffee is premium and the baristas are always friendly. The general feel of the place is right up my alley. All of the wood and metal gives it both an urban and rustic feel.  It's a wonderful coffee shop, a great place to come with a book and read, or bring your computer and get some work done. Whatever you're looking for in a coffee shop, Royal is pretty much guaranteed to have it."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic coffee, made to order, with friendly staff who are happy to be chatty or leave you be. A small patio and inside bar area, which is perfect considering that most people grab and go to or from ASU Tempe. Coffee has been consistently great over the past 6 months I've been going, and if there are ever any mistakes the staff is quickly down to remake drinks for you. For the quality everything is priced well. That, and the staff makes this a great place for coffee lovers who want legit, honest, good coffee."}
