{"text":"I was looking forward to finding a cool coffee place in pickering but this is not it. The service was horrible. The girl behind the cash acted like she hated our very existence! Perhaps she was having a bad day but wow! I will never go back to this place. The sandwich was mediocre but the best was that when she finished making the sandwich she just left it on the counter! She didn't even bother to tell us it was ready. There are plenty of places to get coffee where the staff appreciate business so I'll find some place else."}
{"text":"There's something about their coffee that is just absolutely delicious. The sandwiches are also fresh and tasty. It's a bit pricey but the quality is there."}
{"text":"Used to be good.  Now it seems like it is run by kids and they can't get anything right. Always so disappointing.

And what's with that broken  microwave...  watch out."}
{"text":"Very Friendly employees.
Great food
Great coffee
My favorite is the Irish cream
It has just the right amount of sweetness"}
{"text":"Ordered a cafe au lait meant to be made with espresso  and was given previously brewed coffee. And it tasted awful. Will never be returning."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to get your morning coffee at and a quick snack to eat.  Just stay away from any of the specialty drinks(Lattes, Cappacinos, etc) the folks there need some learning to do here."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE his place. Used to. I moved into the neighbourhood about 4 years ago and have come here at least once a week since. I love their chai latte with a BLT on rye. They use very fresh ingredients, it has a great indie atmosphere and it's nice to know I'm supporting a small business with prices not far off of Tim Hortons. However, recently the service has been terrible and the cleanliness is very questionable. Two visits ago I saw little bugs moving around in a bag of bread they were about to use to make my sandwich. I had to point it out to the sandwich artist, she otherwise would have served it to me. This time the baked goods area looked like it hadn't been cleaned out in weeks for the amount of crumbs of colours that didn't match what was available that day all over the platters. 
Most concerning to me how ever, as a person who worked part time all the way through university, is the turn over of staff. There is never any consistency in service. Do I order, get my food then pay? Or do I order, pay then get my food? I haven't seen the same person working there for well over a year. I understand businesses that operate with part time staff are prone to high turn over, but I can't help but wonder how they are treating their staff. It always seems to come back to the wife, the husband and the mother in law serving me until some other new hirer comes along. 

I hope this place can get it together. It could be a really great little business. It's seems to be just a matter of staffing and consistent training."}
{"text":"They have great coffee and bagels.. Def avoid this place around noon and 3:30 when the high school students are all there on lunch or after school.

The owners and the service is great"}
{"text":"Ok, I have decided to upgrade them to a 4. I like the service which I have gotten the last few times I have been here. Also they grind their own beans, and they know how to roast it better then the crap they give you at tim hortons. Also lately Tim Hortons has been tasting weird to me. Did they change something? I digress. Level up Mr. Beans to a 4"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and came across this small coffee shop. I was overwhelmed by their coffee selection.I ordered the French caramel, but they even have butter crunch chocolate, Irish cream and pumpkin spices I want to try. My hubby ordered a bagel with cream cheese (bacon and cheddar) and a chicken salad for myself. I tried the bagel. It was moist and chewy! Will definitely come again next time I am in town. Will probably try the pretzel bagel! Such a great place for morning coffee and on the go snacks."}
{"text":"This is the neighbourhood indie cafe, as there is no other indies cafe nearby.  We stopped by for a quick pick-me-up.  The coffee and the pastary were passable.  The decoration speaks volume of an ambitious start. It is nice and hip. And neglected.  It was obvious that some maintenance can be done:"}
{"text":"I thought I walked into a highschool cafeteria when I entered. The place was packed with young teenagers from a nearby highschool and even the people behind the counter seemed like highschool students. Went during lunch hours on a weekday and the line seemed long but went by pretty quickly. Got a large Mochachino for $4.20 and the young lad preparing my drink did a pretty good job. It tasted like a Mochachino just like you would get anywhere else. Decent place but like Jennifer K said already its not the type of crowd for everyone. Man that made me feel old saying that :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mr.Beans anymore, years ago it was good. I would have giving it 4 stars back then but I feel like it's gone down hill. 

The drinks are nothing amazing & the food is just so basic! I don't find the prices fair for the food. I'm just really over it. I don't think it would still be in business if it wasn't for the school kids."}
{"text":"Great convenient location when I fill in for work across occasionally; but as Jennifer K says, just don't go at lunch time on a weekday unless you absolutely need to.  I must say that despite their busy hoards of HS students, they do serve you really quickly (I mean, how hard is it to spread some tuna on a bagel?).  I haven't ever been brave enough to try their lattes but I can attest to the fact that they are capable of pouring hot water into a tea and steeping in appropriately.  

Their salmon sandwich and chicken salad sandwich are decent as well and they definitely give generous sized portions!  

Interior is yes...very dated.  It reminds me of those smaller wannabe Timmy's shops back in the early 90s."}
{"text":"This place is okay. It opens early which is good because I needed to kill some time before going to work. I got a small coffee that cost $2 with tax which is a bit expensive in my opinion. They have a wide variety of bagels and muffins when i went so it's a good place to grab a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"I lived in this neighbourhood since 1996 when port union village was built. The original owners had the place immaculate.it was eurostyle. It was amazing coffee and great sandwiches soups and deserts.
They sold .Not sure now how many times it has changed hands. The customer service is still friendly but today coming back into the neighbourhood I was shocked the coffee I make at home tastes better ! What happen to them ?!?? When you have the name that has coffee in it you expect great cofffee. It use to be the best coffee and now has gone down:( for the prices o expect not to be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"This place is convenient and very close to home. My husband and I decided to try this place out and have to say the coffee is great however service is horrible! We were going to order egg salad sandwiches and changed our minds to ice caps. The employee working said, \"Thank god I really didn't want to make it.\" We were thinking, 'who says that to customers?' She was quite rude throughout the whole order. 

We are all about supporting small businesses but not if we don't get any respect from the people working there. We have been there a handful of times and each time the service provided was awful. The employees working always seem to be in a bad mood. Going forward we will not be visiting this place again and rather support a business who gives their customers respect and show good customer service."}
{"text":"Came at a busy time, friendly staffs and a verrry wide selection of flavored coffee. Yay great place for coffee addicts! Very tasty bagel and love the art they have in this cafe."}
{"text":"I think I came to Mr Beans Coffee Company at a wrong time.. maybe it was the right time for all those high school students..but definitely not my type of crowd. 

The Cafe was hopping with this caffeine wired teens ready for partying and some fun time since TGIF... The line was long, but at least most of the patrons just want a slush or just a straight coffee...so I didn't wait long for my cappuccino..... 

I don't understand why the barista was filling up my Cappuccino ($3.45) right to the rim.. as I started spilling my drink even when I tried to take it slowly to the table.......... 

The coffee itself was MEH... more like a latte and I can barely taste the coffee.... 

I think I am spoiled by all the Indie Coffee shops I been to! When will Scarborough going to have a decent one?!!!!

No Wifi... Closes early... Tacky Cafeteria like interior.. 

I don't think I be back!"}
