{"text":"Mmmm, mmm good! Excellent family owned and run stop!

This is a new start up place and been only open for about a month but I can tell that the people that run it are not new to the business.

I have my favorite spots and I'm always looking for another and I think I just found one. I have had two meals here,  late lunch and breakfast and both have been very good. Breakfast today, which I just finished, was an avocado and onion omelette with country potatoes.  ( Sorry, no pics of food, ate it before I thought about it)

The Omelette was very light and fluffy with a huge amount of avocado and onion inside and two different types of cheeses on top. The onions were sauteed just right and tender and the avocado was fresh and plenty of it. Sometimes places cut back in this area. Not so here. 

My potatoes, while not cut on site, we're cooked from fresh cubed potatoes and seasoned just right. 

The only negative, if you can call it that, is the coffee was a bit weak for me but I like my coffee strong. It was also a bit warm inside for me restaurant but as I enjoyed my meal, it cooled off. 

All in all, I certainly can recommend this new start up! 

\" I'll be back!! \""}
{"text":"I've been to many Mexican food places and family dinners but this place is the best so far.  I had the beef fajitas they were the best I've ever had.  I'm a no spice person and these are a must get again. My husband had a number 4  with the green sauce. This was a cheese enchilada and Chile relleno with beans and rice. They were both to his liking he also had a ground beef chimi it has beans but I would suggest the rice for everything it was really good.  To finish the flan is the best you can even get it with cherries. The people are very friendly.  I will be coming back again and again"}
{"text":"Very, very limited menu; nothing offered for children; rice and beans not offered with plates. This location charges restaurant prices but does not offer restaurant type entrees. Service is slow, but friendly. In addition, our entire table was sweating and no AC and not one fan was on."}
{"text":"not to bad of a place I think they just opened a few weeks ago so they have some bugs to work out the carne asada was decent but a little salty but they were super fat very feeling and they were like 7 Bucks can't beat that deal the people that work there are very friendly will be back to try their breakfast menu looks pretty damn Delicious and cheap"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to tryout this place because they sell food Ciudad Juárez style (my home town). El Cometa restaurante in Juárez is a must for us every time we go that way.  Well, lets begin with the folkloric decorations of the place. A bit too extreme for my taste but I guess they want to make sure customers know it's a Mexican restaurant. Well no doubt about that!! Service was fast. But I must add it was Friday around lunch time and we were the only customers in restaurant. We got chips and salsa.  Chips tasted fresh but salsa was tasteless. 
I order bistec alambre tacos with cheese and wife got flautas originales.  My plate was nothing but steak with lots of onions and bell peppers with a bit of cheese. Tortillas come separate with a side of guacamole and lime wedges.  My meat was good. A bit of guacamole and lime and tacos were perfect.  Flautas were tasteless. Hardly any meat in them. Came with lots of old lettuce and a some avocado slices.  Not the best I had.  
All I can say is, they need to work a bit more on seasoning food and salsas. I might give it a second chance. Not sure yet."}
{"text":"It seems to be a family establishment and it's very cozy. Decided to stop by on a whim and I really like it. The salsa has good flavor. The enchilada sauce is very good and my chimichanga fondido style is very good as well. I will definitely be coming back again and again. The prices are great and not over priced at all. They are doing a good job for being so new."}
{"text":"Great service, but food not so great. Ordered the cheese enchilada plate with rice & beans. Enchilada sauce is way too salty. Ordered a side of sour cream which I got charged for to try to tame down the saltiness, but even with that would not recommend. Husband ordered the shrimp stuffed chile relleno. It was soggy with tons of seeds. Not fun to eat & hard to enjoy. Kids ordered shrimp fajitas and the bacon wrapped shrimp. I think they enjoyed their dinners more than my husband & I. It's mediocre. Tried because of the high ratings on yelp, but would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food great service! A nice addition to the West Valley! This is a family-run restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone to go visit them and have a Great meal great service great pricing!"}
{"text":"One word... DELICIOUS!!! Came in for the grand opening and the waitress was so kind and very attentive. Ordered a Chorizo Omelette and country potatoes everything was cooked to perfection! Definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants authentic Mexican food!"}
