{"text":"Unfortunately no live band tonight but satisfied our Guinness beef stew craving. Also ordered the chicken pot pie.... Excellent portion . Flaky pastry top creamy sauce My beer off the tap wasn't well chilled tho."}
{"text":"I love this pub. It's got multiple rooms upstairs and downstairs, so a cozy spot can be found for just about anything. More like a traditional English/Irish style public house than an American pub, Hurley's has a low-key homey, cozy feel most of the time, and it cranks it up a notch on Friday and Saturday nights. There's live music most weekend nights, great storytelling on Sunday nights, and the hockey games on the screen behind the bars. There's a great couch and fireplace area upstairs that is usually hard to get. Downstairs there are tables for large groups. The craic at this place can't be beat.   The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food is rather unremarkable standard pub fare. But if you're looking for a place to go with friends for a pint (or three...), then Hurley's can't be beat."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I can only assume they were having a VERY off night.   From the moment we walked in, things did not go well. We were not acknowledged for about 10 minutes by the waitress. When we finally got her attention and let her know that we had a reservation for a friends b-day party we were told the reservation was cancelled because we didn't show up. Well, we were right there, we had been 5-10 minutes late and then waited 10 minutes for someone to talk to us. At least there was place to sit, so we grabbed a table and waited another 10 before the waitress came to ask if we wanted menus.  Finally we ordered a drink and when she came back we asked if we could order some appetizers while we waited for the rest of our party. She told us we had to wait for the next server because she was closing out. I've worked in a restaurant before, so I understand this, but that being said, I think it's pretty standard to punch in the order and then transfer it over to the new waitress when she comes in! She must have seen that we were not impressed because she came back about 5 minutes later saying the new server hadn't show up so she would punch our food it.  The appetizers were ok, nothing special. The wings were a bit on the cold side - just tasted re-heated and not made to order. Fried zucchini and sweet potato fries were fine.  When the rest of our party arrived and we ordered our dinners, the mains were much worse. I had a corned beef sandwich, which was the special, the bread was stale as if it had been sitting out all evening, the meat was cold and chewy and the cheese was dry and hard. I barely ate half the sandwich and the new waitress did not even question it. It would have been nice if she had at least asked if every thing was ok.  On top of this, the first waitress didn't tell the new waitress to take our table, so we were completely ignored for about half an hour, with empty glasses and new people at our table.  The only saving grace of the night was the live music, it was a Monday night, two guys playing classic rock music, really talented and friendly guys. They're the only reason this review gets two stars because the service and the food really sucked."}
{"text":"Very very slow service. 15 minutes have passed and still am not able to order. This is quite amazing. Don't expect to have a quick beer. It just won't happen."}
{"text":"Great location, great selection of brews.   Very friendly wait staff.   Loved the ambiance.   We'll be back.  Hey it's right downtown."}
{"text":"I was there last month (September) on a Sunday, so maybe I picked the wrong night to go, but I thought this place was pretty mediocre. We went for dinner at around 6 and sat outside as the weather was nice enough. Very English-friendly, being on Crescent Street (touristy area). The beer seemed kind of pricey, but the waitress was very nice, and our food came right away.  Overall, a good place to maybe hop by on your way down the street, but not super special or anything."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, awesome live music! Best Irish pub in Town"}
{"text":"\"May your Guardian angel be at your side to pick ya up off the floor and hand ya another cold stout\"  Yep I LOVE this place. I love its dark corners, it's twists and turns and seeing the usual faces.  It's like a warm familiar hug. Be it early afternoon and I'm just chillin' with a beer on the terrasse, or stumbling' in late in the evening and staying till last call, it feels like home. *sigh* Welcome home.   Fuggedaboutit'"}
{"text":"great place to grab a beer, loved the outside terrace.  great bar staff, good guiness searved with a smile."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but was hot and food was not superb. Chicken tenders are the frozen kind. Sweet potato fries were good however. Go for a drink and skip the meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a beer to check out the Friday night scene. It was an older crowd than the college like scene at Brutopia next door. Everyone was pretty drunk. There was a live Irish band playing which was fun to watch. Overall cool bar with a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here. Confused this pub with another Irish pub"}
{"text":"Loved Hurley's.  Came for a quick drink and a bite before our flight back to Vancouver and thoroughly enjoyed the sunny patio and great atmosphere.  I had the poutine but it was quite sweet so not too impressed (I think they cooked the fries in the same oil as my friends yam fries, yuck).  The waitress was kinda pissed at me for not loving the poutine exclaiming \"but we're known for our poutine\".  Anyway, I still really enjoyed it there and will make it a definite go-to place next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Hurley's...how well you treat me. This place is the perfect Irish pub. I came in on a Thursday night and the place was pretty busy. It was self seating, and we elected to hang out on the back patio. There was plenty of places to sit, if you're looking for an irish pub with outdoor seating, this is the place to go.   The place has an amazing atmosphere. Another reviewer described it as the quintessential Irish pub, and this is true, but Hurley's atmosphere is something special. Live music, every night, and I was surprised by how good the musicians were. They played music ranging from classic rock to irish traditionals to acoustic with a slight country feel to it. A few people were dancing inside and they had plenty of room to do it.  What made Hurley's for me was 2 things: truly the best Guinness in town and amazing service. Our waitress was Azaray (i probably mispelled that) and her bartending counterpart was Daniel. These two were great. Azaray served us very well, especially considering how busy she was. Her and Daniel worked perfectly as a team. Daniel had excellent beer and scotch reccommendations. He was one of those bartenders that actually knew what i was looking for and was very helpful and extremely friendly. he gave me and my mate alot of advice on other good local bars too, which being from out of town, we greatly appreciated.  To sum it all up, Hurley's has great service, a great atmosphere, great drinks, good food, and IS the best Irish pub on rue Crescent. Oh they have good specials too, their poutine (which was fantastic) was only $7"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been there for several times and I think it's one of the best I have ever been.Tried different dishes and snacks all are excellent and the beer is awesome!Friendly waitresses and the cozy atmosphere can create unforgettable moments with your friends.The performance of the Irish band is really eye-catching and makes you stay there for a long long time and lose the track of time !"}
{"text":"In the backyard, when is not winter, this place is always a good option to hang out, relax,have a drink, listen good music and discover the wheel again..."}
{"text":"Refused to serve me because I was too drunk and causing a wild commotion. Let me sit at the bar and only kicked me out once I started falling asleep. Paid the bartender all of the change in my pockets for a glass of water. The water was decent quality. Overall, ok experience."}
{"text":"Mon pub irlandais préféré à Montréal. La bouffe est bonne et il y a de la Guinness. Parfaite combinaison."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20 years. This is THE Irish pub in Montreal. Great place for Irish pub music - live shows every night of the week with an extra Saturday afternoon music session.   Best on-tap import beer in town though at $8.50-$9.00 it becomes an expensive night out if this is your sole destination.   Food is hit or miss unfortunately as cooks come and go and the food changes. Safe bets are the burgers which are always good and the stews.   Very friendly staff and I would actually say that it's the friendliest staff I've ever seen in town.   Only 4 stars because the drinks are expensive and apart from the burgers and stews, the food can be great or no better than something that comes from a can (stay away from the onion soup...).   So come on by, grab a beer and listen to some great live music!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best food in any Irish pub in the Montreal area, Hurley's Irish Pub is the hands down winner. Live music and the best Guinness pour, friendly staff and folks from all over converge right here."}
{"text":"This place was teeming with young, fun, boisterous people when I came to Montreal for a visit. On a short weekend trip with some girlfriends, I never expected to meet so many friendly strangers. Hurley's was the perfect pit stop for some beers and food while enjoying a night out on the town!"}
{"text":"Good selection of beers and tasty eats, though the pizza I ordered did take a while to arrive. Choice of music was pretty pleasant as well. Prices shown are inclusive of tax which is nice."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a friend looking for somewhere to get some hearty food so I could warm up. (Yes, it was only -1C, but hey - I'm a Californian. I was cold!)  The place is pretty much your quintessential Irish pub. Lots of old wood, real dart board (don't see enough of those), and a well crafted Guinness. I went for the lamb stew, which was huge (and tasty). My friend went for the shepherd's pie which he enjoyed.  There wasn't necessarily anything that stood out. Like I said - it was through and through your quintessential Irish pub. And there is not a single thing wrong with that."}
{"text":"discovered this pub by mistake...great chill, down to earth vibe. bunch of Rugby players were celebrating their game so that made it interesting.  great live music too!  http://instagram.com/p/eRYh4Yo1Hc/"}
{"text":"My first time last night. This is a great pub people are friendly ,staff are great.Mike behind the bar connected very well with the patrons.being an Irish person did not hurt. The beer was cold and tasted great. What more do you need from pub other than music and authentic decor, and they had that too"}
{"text":"The second I get off the train, bus or plane I go straight to Hurleys. Sometimes I go again on the way back to the train station, bus depot or airport. That's how obsessed with it I am. Always have a good time, good beer and good food. (Too much use of the word \"good,\" eh?) Mich and Mark on the bar are sooooooo nice! And Agnes in the kitchen cares about you! If you've ever read my dating blog (walkinsauce.tumblr.com), you KNOW I'm a bar connoisseur. Oh and ladies, a good spot to pick up dudes."}
{"text":"visiting from New Jersey this week and wandered into Hurley's because i love Irish pubs. Went to two other ones in Montreal first and they didn't compare. Rod was a terrific bartender and incredibly friendly. The beer is about $8 a pint but that's worth it for the authentic feel of Ireland! I was in Ireland last year and this place really was like hanging out in Dublin. We were at Hurley's twice this week because we enjoyed it so much the first night. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was fun as hell. Met a cool group of canadians. Drinks were good. St. Catherine street is always fun. Always stopped in here tho. Probably cuz all my buddy's were irish and went just for the name. haha"}
{"text":"\" Location\" , bière abordable, music live, personnel simpatique et efficace. Voilà se qui assure le succès du Hurley's depuis toutes ses année.  Je préfère personnellement le Brutopia pour la bière et le Irish Embassy pour la terrasse, mais le Hurley's est une solide institution montréalaise que je visite encore. Les brunchs  de fin de semaine ici furent pour moi un classique. Mais vous savez on change et il est difficile de ne pas prendre une bière après le brunch  au Hurley's..... et il est de moins en moins facile de se lever le Lundi matin !!! ;-)  Pourquoi 4/5: Location, location location,! Les différents niveaux et sections sont pour moi un avantage. Labyrinthe pour les un, moi j'aime bien avoir la possibilité d'écouter où non le band.  Quand je veux parler on peu trouver un coin tranquille!"}
{"text":"Walking through the streets of downtown, we came across this Irish pub and decided to see what it was all about. The inside looked very traditional with dim lighting, music and a crowd of people drinking and having a great time. Since we came here solely for drinks that's really all I can base this review on... so let's get started.  The drink menu was filled with unique beers and cocktails. What I was impressed with the most was how much the total ended up being for the amount my boyfriend and I ordered. Let me just break this down: we ordered beers, 2 Irish car bombs, 2 Jameson pineapples, two shots of what the bartender named \"burnt waffles\" (we asked for something good but not too sweet and that was the result) and I believe 2 more shots of a specific type of whiskey I cannot remember.   May I add, the shots, as well as the beers and drinks were not small or skimp on alcohol, which is always a plus. We estimated what the total would be and were so shocked that it didn't even come close. BUT, what I will say is that the tax sucks anywhere in Canada lol, so of course it bumped it up a little more. Prices based on the drinks alone though are a steal. The burnt waffle shot, highly recommended.  The crowd inside included people of all ages. It had a good amount of locals, students, tourists and what I assume to be regulars. Service was really quick too!  The overall atmosphere and vibe at this pub was right down my alley. Causal, but a great place to have a night out.   If you're the type of person who enjoys drinks that creep up and hit you at just the right time, this is your spot."}
{"text":"We had a good but not great experience at Hurley's last night, when we made a special trip to check out their Burns Night (Scottish celebration).  Upon our arrival, we were invited to seat ourselves, and spent a few minutes wandering around the warren of rooms to try to find a table. We ended up upstairs in the second room with a stage set up for a live band later in the evening.  Menus and beers came promptly, but something went wrong with our supper. It took over an hour from time of ordering. To the server's credit, he took the initiative to follow up with the kitchen when he noticed how long we had been waiting. The food was pretty tasty when it arrived -- seemed to be good-quality ingredients, a bit heavy-handed with the salt. My burger was a bit worse for wear (tough on top and soggy on the bottom from sitting under a heat lamp waiting for my husband's bangers and mash to be ready is my guess).   Menu prices included taxes, which made for a nice surprise when we paid the bill.   The pub really filled up at the end of the Canadiens game, and perhaps also due to the popularity of the band. The atmosphere was very friendly and laid-back.  Our reason for going to Hurley's was their promised Robbie Burns celebration, with piper, Highland dancers, the address to the haggis, etc. The layout of the pub really wasn't ideal for such a thing, as we crowded into a small room downstairs to hear the toast but couldn't see or hear much over the general ruckus. We left without getting a taste of haggis."}
{"text":"This place is great. Didn't eat, just drank, so can't comment on the food but our service was good, the patrons were friendly and the music (Solstice) was AWESOME! It's a bit cavernous and has somewhat low ceilings, so if that's not your thing you may prefer somewhere else on Cresent. For me it's pub nirvana. Thanks for a great night I'll never forget!"}
{"text":"Draught St-Ambroise Pale Ale!!  That, and a large selection of whiskies (and whiskeys);  decent, if somewhat bleakly-surrounded terrasse for warm-weather drinking;   good, sometimes great kitchen;  Irish and other folk music on cold winter nights;   the extremely good-natured staff and owner;  all these things together make this place my regular haunt.   What makes me want to die there, though, is the Hurley's Fry-Up, an inexpensive weekend breakfast platter featuring a sweat-inducing array of 100% cholesterol-rich transfats garnished with a pretty little slice of orange.   I ask politely and get mine no eggs, extra meat (swoon).   That,  with a pint of the local copper ale and a pony of Redbreast, on a December Saturday mid-afternoon, with nothing else in particular to do?  Blinding.  Just f*cking blinding."}
{"text":"I always stop by for a quick beer or two when I return home to Montreal. This is one of the pubs I grew up in during college & university. Given the close proximity to hotels and Crescent street, they get a lot of tourists.  Hurley's is 100% old school and looks like as a traditional Irish pub should but is beginning to look a little dated. It's spread out over two floors with lots of separate seating areas, private corners and a large patio in front. Despite the large size, it gets really busy Thursday - Saturday. My recent visit was a Sunday night and it was dead.  The crowd is broadly mixed - students, locals, tourists, suits and regulars. Its one of those places you just feel comfortable hanging out with friends and enjoying a few beers. You will likely meet new friends as well.   Hurley's have a number of beers on tap but they offer none of the amazing Quebec craft brews. With all the amazing Montreal brew pubs relatively close by, I'm less motivated to hang around or visit as often.    In fairness, Hurley's is not necessarily competing with the brew pubs (although one moved in next store), it's more about a relaxing friendly environment, drinking with friends and enjoying live music spread over two floors.   The staff are friendly and engage in conversation. I recommend sitting near the bar areas - I find the service is better as staff tend to gravitate towards the bar (especially when it's not busy).  If your interested in an evening of social drinking and fun, Hurley's will certainly do the trick... but if your after interesting local beers, you will likely be disappointed.   BK"}
{"text":"Hurley's is my favourite pub and Montreal. Between the live music, the awesome patio, and the more than ample seating, it's been my go-to place since I moved to this city,.especially for first dates.  The reason I've rated it four stars instead of five comes down to two issues:  1) The food isn't the greatest. The pub fare is inconsistent and often too greasy or cold, and the vegetarian options are non-existent.  2) The prices at Hurley's are, across the board, higher than just about any where else - significantly so.  It's still my favourite, but I'd go there more often if it wasn't so expensive."}
{"text":"Poutine and Guinness as well as the staff is on point.... Come one, come all to this gem of a pub"}
{"text":"Kudos to Hurley's for giving us an entire room for over 2 hours, so we could hold a Friars' Club-style roast for a friend of ours during his Montreal bachelor party.  We had called ahead in the weeks preceding our visit and the manager told us that he would set aside a particular area that provided the necessary privacy for us to drink, eat, and make noise while delivering our speeches and presentations.  Upon arrival, tables and customers were shifted and we held court with minimal distraction for quite some time.  The beer and shots kept flowing and the only noise around us was live music -- either Irish fiddlers or singers -- which did not interfere with our events.  Since we provided a good amount of business, we appreciated being granted this area -- which included a stage where a band normally plays -- to offer us an exceptional venue to host this memorable event.  We especially liked the continual service of Azure, who took great care of us and did not mind our noise or follies.  This is an authentic Irish pub where grabbing a drink is an easy, every day event without pretension or high cost.  Definitely worth checking out when you just want to kick back and drift away to Ireland while in French Canada."}
{"text":"Best Irish Pub in Montreal!   Had the Irish Beef Stew and it was delicious.  22 beers on tap.  The had a fantastic Irish band playing.   Great crowd.  Can't say enough.  Will be back whenever I come to Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is both relaxing and fun at the same time. One of the best Irish pubs in the city. You never get bored of the interior design of the place with many things you discover every time you go there. Staff are friendly and on top of their job. The food has a good quality. You can find a very good selection of beers, whiskeys and other drinks. Later in the evening specially on weekends you can enjoy live music as well."}
{"text":"Very very bad. First of all, the service is bad. We had to go inside and find our waitress ourselves, and everything is slow. The food is also not good, the burger meat patty taste bad, and the bread bun is bad, and I don't like they put blue cheese in the burger, it ruins everything. And with such bad service and bad food, they expect at least 15% tips. Worst pub I ever been to."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Got the French onion soup which had hints of Guinness inside and tons of onion. The Irish beef stew was perfect. Melt in your mouth potatoes and meat. Really pleasantly surprised.   Friends got the chicken tenders and nachos. Their fries are really really good. Buttery good. Kind of want to know how they fry them so well. The chicken was lightly fried and had spices mixed in so it had a bit of bite after eating but still great none the less. Next time I want to try their poutine with those dang frites.   Service was alright. Really nice waiters compared to the McKibbins where we went first before getting rudely ignored as we tried to get a seat. We walked out and drove here. So we were pleased by the friendliness. We grabbed a seat but it felt like no one was around so there was a bit of a wait. It was also really really loud due to some rowdy people at the bar but that was to be expected.   Weirdest thing is that they don't have Shepherds pie. Kind of Irish pub staple but the stew more than made up for it."}
{"text":"I've been to Hurley's quite a few times... especially after I started staying at the Quality Inn (right across the street). It's a very cool multilevel bar with a couple patios out front. Typical bar food & drinks. But there's always a cool crowd filling up the place. Quite a few TVs to catch a game and they occasionally have live bands. It's also known to be a hangout for TV/Radio/Print media after hockey games at the Bell Centre."}
{"text":"I can't believe this wasn't my first Yelp review. Hurleys is my favorite Irish pub in all of Montreal and I've been going there for years!   It's a traditional Irish pub with dimly lit corners that kind of feels like your living room (OK, depending on where you sit). It's laid out onto two floors, with terrasses in front and out back. Upstairs, you will find a cozy corner, equipped with a fireplace (See? Just like your living room). Despite it's size, on weekends, they really pack it in and you will often find yourself standing. On occasion, you will feel like a sardine but hey - that's the price you pay when frequenting one of Montreal's best pubs. That said, the vibe is awesome and you easily forget that you don't have a seat.   In terms of food - love it. Their fish and chips are amazing (the batter is super crispy), and the Hurleys Club is equally good. They are very generous with their portions and if you've got fries coming your way, you HAVE to ask for their curry mayo. It is SO good.   There's live music from some pretty awesome bands (like Salty Dog and Solstice) from Thursday to Saturday night, if I'm not mistaken, so it's a great place to hang out with friends and/or meet new people."}
{"text":"I loved this place that I came here twice during my trip!!!! The Guinness on tap was the best Guinness I've ever had.  The other night I came, I got the Irish car bomb.  They have a lot of different sections to enjoy your time. They have darts too! Of course this Irish pub had live music and the band was amazing. They asked for any recommendations for songs too This is a must place to come to"}
{"text":"Some serious fun times.  Great live  music on a Saturday night.    This place was happening and not your thump thump music a few blocks north.  If you're really drunk you may even be able to find me lucky charms."}
{"text":"Waitress was a complete bitch. I had to go inside to ask for service on the outside patio. I asked \" is there someone working outside ?\" She replied \"uhh yeah ?\" I said okay can you send them out please she replied \"it's me why what's the problem\" just wanted some service she laughed and continued being her uneducated self sitting on the counter talking to someone in the back. Trash"}
{"text":"On a choisi la terrasse qui est assez grande. J'ai choisi le très bon fish & ships bien croustillant. Assiette généreuse avec les très bonnes frites maison et une petite salade de choux bien gouteuse. Le ragout d'agneau très bon aussi. Le service est sans reproche."}
{"text":"Pub très sympa, terrasse déjà ouverte le 1e mai! Ils ont une bière apparemment spéciale pour laquelle mes collègues voulaient absolument qu'on aille là, la Hop Height si je me souviens bien.. c'est entre une blonde et une IPA, goût original, perso j'ai bien aimé! Petit hic le service a été assez long on a attendu une bonne demie heure avant qu'on vienne prendre notre commande... Par contre une fois la commande prise ça a été assez rapide.. Les frites de patate douce sont vraiment bonnes et viennent avec une petite mayonnaise au curry succulente. Bref, à essayer!"}
{"text":"Do not order the fish and chips. It was inedible. I went home and had a bagel, which was much better."}
{"text":"Decent food, excellent outdoor area. I believe it could exceed your expectations. For three, with booze, CAD 77, less tip."}
{"text":"A trip to Montreal would not be complete without a mandatory night out at Hurley's Irish Pub! This place is one of my all-time favorite Irish pubs outside of New York. Central downtown location, situated along Rue Crescent off the main Ste. Catherine's Ouest, makes this a perfect pre night out stop - or spend the entire night here like I did.  Hurley's is housed in an old Brownstone and has a cavernous feel to it with many nooks to settle in to. The main floor has a small but loaded centrally located bar. Nightly, traditional Irish musicians usually fill the back and produce some real authentic Irish tunes for a nice vibe. Upstairs also has nightly music, but usually more contemporary musicians - think U2 cover bands. During the winter months, the upstairs has nice fireplace going to sit around while you down your pints of Guinness.  My friends and I stopped in for a couple of pints on our way out and found out the band SOLSTICE was playing this night! We saw them play last year here. They were so good that we decided to change our plans and stay here to catch this extremely talented band. We're glad we did because within moments of them starting, the place seriously packed out! (Think of 40 Irish jiggers in a room that holds 20 - lmfao, it was insane!)  Service was great as always! Don't understand these reviewers who claim to have had cold and indifferent service? These folks are so welcoming and hospitable. Never had one bad experience any of the times I went here. They serve pretty decent pub food as well; we split nachos platter $11.95 (enough for 3), Hurley's burger $8.95, and Guinness Stew $15.50.    Thanks for another great night out, we had such a blast and can't wait for next time!!!"}
{"text":"From quaint and quiet, to loud and boisterous, Hurley's has it all! Depending on time of the night you can have a quiet conversation or hear a local band. Either way, the cider is good, the space comfortable and like a pub you'd want to be your local. Of course good company is important, but I feel like you could probably strike up a conversation with a stranger and have just as good of a time here."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for some years now during our visits for F1.  It's just down the street from where we stay so its also convenient.   It has a great party atmosphere that's for sure and a great selection of beers.  If you are lucky enough to come on the days before and after the races you will be pleasantly surprised with excellent service and room to breath   During the F1 you go at your own risk knowing the place is very popular. Food:  we had wings again but this time my hubbie also had the curry of the day (lamb) and it was excellent.  The wings are ok; the sauce is an odd colour orange but is tasty but it came back on us afterwards for some time. It's a great local bar!"}
{"text":"We went to this place based on Yelp rating and ended up very dissapointed. Beer selection was good, crowd was great, but the place and services was way bellow our expectation.  Knowing the quality and standard of other pubs and bars around Montreal, this place was a big no. Service was super slow and if you are a beer lover, please don't sit on the bar. Once you see how is the beer treated, foam putted on side in a glass and later added into a pitcher.. Wow!  The best was when I paid and gave \"only\" 10% tip and then was educated about how the waitress is paying for me to sit there if I don't tip at least 15%. I am sorry, you have to earn it.  ...so many better places around, where they treat you as a customer as well as a friend. Never again Hurley's for me."}
{"text":"Rod A. Was very helpful and quick to respond to my questions.  He offered good advice about when to come so as to avoid large crowds. The staff was very accommodating and kind. The music was great and so was the food. I had a few pints of Guinness and a half-platter of nachos. The toppings on the nachos were fresh and the portion size was generous. Being by myself, it was nice to be greeted by such warm and friendly service. There was a large party nearby, but I never went more than a couple of minutes with an empty glass. I'm looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"It's a pub - nuff said.   The atmosphere is great, the live music is a nice touch, however the food was just ok - regular pub fare, with the poutine having cold cheese on it - not the best way to rouse an appetite..."}
{"text":"It's in the middle of party-hardy Rue Crescent, but this Irish Pub has some serious positives going for it. For one, it's sprawling. Enough nooks and crannies inside to please the drinkers who want to hide, but also boasting a nice shaded patio that is perfect in the summertime for some imbibing and people-watching. Second, the Guinness is poured correctly and has been fresh on the three occasions I've visited (three sporadic visits over the course of three years). Third, I do have to say that I think the food is a cut above average for an Irish pub. The poutine is GREAT by pub standards and their Irish stew is full of tender chunks of beef. Because of its location and ubiquitous appeal, the place is packed to the gills on every weekend night in the summer -- but it's still a fun ride. Even if you're not interested in carousing until the wee hours of the morning, Hurley's is a good bet for some guilty food pleasures and a pint."}
{"text":"My favourite go-to pub in the city. Great, warm ambiance, fantastic service and superb pub grub."}
{"text":"A moment-by-moment description of why hurling might be better than going to Hurley's:  Our friend tried to order us some veggie burgers before we got there, but they came back and told her that they had just run out.  This was just in time for the kitchen to close.  The waitress refused to list the beers on tap (\"Listen, there are 38.\") or to give us a menu listing them.  She also neglected to bring me water, which was the only thing I asked for after 16 hours of flying internationally.  She cautioned us that one of the IPAs was bitter... A friend politely disagreed, and she kindly and condescendingly informed us that IPAs are bitter.  It was helpful, considering I had chosen that particular night to taste my first beer. #puttingthe'patron'inpatronizing  It was overpriced, about $9 CA for one particular pint.  And the worst part? *no one* would join our friend in trying to get her Irish jig on to the live fiddle music.  Luckily, we had four more days to change our minds about the city from our introduction via this basement bar.  Know what else is underground? Hades. And hipsters. It's no coincidence."}
{"text":"I will start by saying there is typically nothing I hate more than an Irish pub, they are always corny, the beer is usually border line terrible, and the decor almost always cheesey.  However, when I saw how full the patio was I had to give Hurley's a try. I headed in and dared to order a pint of the black, and was very excited to be served a good pint of Guinness, probably the best I have had in Canada. The bar man was kind and attentive. Although there was a certain cheese factor like all other Irish pubs, this one lacked the over the top cheesiness which kept it tolerable. Another bonus, in addition to the patio in front there is also a good side patio in the back with heaters which pump out, well, heat.  The patrons in this pub were great craic; mostly filled with tourists it was nice and social, a friendly place. I felt if I walked in the next day people may have really known my name.  I would definately recommend this place to start out your night on Crescent!"}
{"text":"Labyrinthine Irish pub serving up a well poured Guinness. We were wandering Ste Catherine Street, when one of our group suggested Hurley's. The terrace was full, the downstairs rooms were full, and we wandered upstairs where we found a virtually empty bar with just the barman, a waitress and a bar back. After joshing us about the bar being \"staff only\", we sat down and ordered drinks. I got a nicely poured Guinness. It wasn't a \"perfect pour\", but it was a good one. The staff was friendly and attentive, even after the bar filled up to listen to the live music. Hurley's is an honest bar in the cheesy Ste Catherine street area."}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early lunch and was first customer of the day. Staff were accommodating and let me sit wherever I liked. I choose inside behind the bar area as it was very hot out and I had been walking a lot.  Had the chicken sandwich with their 'special' sauce. Not sure what the sauce was other than quite tasty. It started to fill up when I was half done with my meal.  Rue crescent is pretty cheesy but hurleys was a good place for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"The fried mars bar is delicious! Also a great spot to watch hockey/football games & grab a drink."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at this authentic Irish Pub. I highly recommend their Irish Stew! Great food, great environment. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Good bar. Plenty of people watching for sure!  We're there with a work group for a short while on Thursday night.  They had good drink specials on that night"}
{"text":"on est allé un groupe de 4. Arrivés sans réservation un samedi soir vers 20h00. On a eu de la place sans attendre. Service pas pire rapide (y commençait a avoir du monde) La bouffe était bonne mais un peu trop tiède et assez salé. La (les) bière (s) était bonne et froide. La facture était très correcte. L'ambience était excellente. Le serveur ne parlait pas français vraiment, mais c'est Montréal et sur Crescent St. donc assez normal. J'y retournerais anytime !"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - I came the beef stew is quite good here and the place is quite homely. I came on a quiet day so there wasn't the usual festivities going on. Felt the portion was just right - not too filling but enough for a beer to accompany."}
{"text":"My favorite pub in Montreal! I personally love visiting this place, particularly during the winter months and watch hockey games with friends. There's plenty of beer on tap, at decent prices and service is generally efficient for a pub despite having to answer the silliest questions by new patrons.  Let me break this down.  There is close to 40 beers on tap. DO NOT ask the waitress \"What's on tap?\".   You're wasting your time.   You're wasting her time.   Get up beforehand and take a looksie. If you didn't, excuse yourself and go take a looksie instead of asking this silly question. Make a couple of mental notes and ask her your specific beer questions. Not only are they quite pretty and friendly but also quite knowledge of their beers!  Once your questions are answered, order away.  I'm also a fan of their Guinness Stew. It's hearty and memorable. Is it cold outside? Yes? Then this will hit the spot along with your favorite beer(s) on the side.  My only issue about the place? Location! Parking is bloody difficult around these parts, especially on game nights. Expect to either pay for parking, to find parking FAR FAR AWAY or being lucky to find a parking space within a mile of this place!"}
{"text":"So I had to hit the oldest Irish pub in Montreal.  I really liked this place.  Multiple levels, old pub feel.  They serve food, but I only got beer.  Watched a rugby match (France v Wales) with a bunch of hooligans.  I like that kind of thing.  A very fun place to hang out.  The beers were good, the bartender was knowledgable, and didn't mind us asking questions about the area.  Overall a must stop if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Hurley's est un incontournable dans le monde des pubs à Montréal! Typiquement Irlandais dans son décor, son ambiance et même les habitués de la place, c'est LE pub à Montréal qui vous donnera l'impression de voyager outre-mer au pays des \"40 shades of green\".   De loin de le pub avec la plus grande variété d'ambiances, vous trouverez toujours un espace propice au ton de votre soirée. Avec 5 petites salles\salons au rez-de-chaussé, vous avez le choix de la bibliothèque\chambre de trophées qui est bien tranquille; une section retirée de la folie du bar; autour du bar comme un pro; dans la section arrière qui est à la fois l'avant-scène; ou un autre salon qui accommode bien les groupes. Au 2e étage, vous avez le choix d'une de 4 autres sections, dont un bar pour les amateurs de sports et même une avec un foyer fonctionnel et fauteuils!  Au moins trois soirs par semaine, vous aurez droit à des prestations musicales au sons de l'Île d'Emeraude et de style session. Certains soirs, il y a même deux groupes qui jouent à la fois, dont une au rez-de-chaussé et l'autre dans la salle arrière au 2e étage (généralement plu contemporain et alternatif en genre). Ce qui est génial, c'est que les spectacles sont gratuits! Ils se veulent vraiment un divertissement pour les clients et une touche de plus pour ajouter à l'authenticité de la place. Quelques fois dans l'année, ils ont même un conteur irlandais qui vient conter des histoires traditionnelles!   Et c'est pas fini! Quelqu'un a dit terrasses? Hurley's vous en offre TROIS!!! Oui, oui! Le bar a trois terrasses différentes! Deux à l'avant, dont une qui donne directement sur la rue Crescent et l'autre au 2e étage, et une superbe cour arrière en pierres avec des flambeaux, son propre bar et où on peut écouter les bands jouer sans être directement dans l'action!    Bref, j'aime vraiment cette place! Je m'y retrouve souvent, y passe chacune de mes fêtes de la St-Patrick, et j'adore l'esprit inter-générationnel et authentiquement irlandais."}
{"text":"After coming from another nearby local pub which was kind of quiet, it was nice to walk into a bit more crowded, louder Hurley's.  We mingled through the crowd for a bit and eventually found a seat. I was impressed that our server found us so quickly and often given the crowd.   I was in celebration mode since it was a bachelor party and therefore had many shots and mixed drinks as opposed to draught beers which I would have been nice to try. Our waitress was quite efficient and a get-down-to-business gal. No time for small talk which was fine given the crowd. Our drinks arrived promptly, correctly and often which was paramount.   The live music was great. They played lots of great tunes.   The crowd was a nice mix in local and tourists from various age groups. Everybody I talked to seemed friendly and was just out to have a good time. It just seems like a very comfortable place and I like that.   On the whole, Hurley's was a good experience. A fun Irish pub I would definitely check out again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last time we were in town, the food was great, the beer was great. Mark was our server and he rocked.  We started with nachos, they were well cooked and full of toppings.  Followed it up with the lamb stew which was excellent! My wife had the club sandwich, it was huge. Great bread, awesome topping and the fries it came with were amazing.  Go here!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an Irish pub with friendly staff and a fun atmosphere, this is the place to go.  If you're looking for luxury and a gourmet meal, this is not the place to go.    The charcuterie plate and chicken fingers were terrific.  The waitress was friendly and helpful.  The beer and wine were exactly what you would expect in an Irish pub.    We left full, happy, and drunk - what more could you want with an inexpensive pub?!"}
{"text":"This place has always had a special spot in my heart and in the hearts of most locals, it's old and rambly and comfortable like a real Irish pub ought to be. The layout, wrapping around the sunken level (my favourite) out to the terrasses and up to the stately polished bar on the second floor, gives the feeling of small rooms. Hurley's at times is shire-like with it's low stone walls, low red leather chairs, and corner couches lit with glowing gold globed chandeliers to give a warm not too dark but still romantic glow. Here yesterday I was happy peeping grey haired, soft spoken folks in close personal conversations over wine and pints, sitting right next to young professionals and even scruffy, paint splattered, uke-slinging internet nerds  like us. The soup of the day was an unexpectedly delicious rice and chicken, and the deep fried mozzarella sticks and hot wings were piled high, crisp, fresh tasting and pub perfect."}
{"text":"Hurley's est le pub irlandais par excellence à Montréal. Le décor est typique de ce type de lieu: pierre, brique, boiseries. On y retrouve plusieurs sections pour tous les goûts: un bar sportif où l'on présente les matchs importants, une section avec un vrai foyer à bois (l'hiver), une section avec un band de style irlandais et quelques recoins intimes. Sans parlé des trois terrasses l'été.   La nourriture est autant variée que succulente. Ouvert tous les jours de 11h -3h. C'est l'endroit parfait pour prendre une pause avec des amis. Ma recommandation est le black velvet. Une boisson de Guiness et de cidre. Ce mariage est parfait sucré et légèrement amers. Pour bien réussir un black velvet, la Guiness absolument doit flotter sur le cidre. Hurley`s concocte les meilleurs en ville.  Hurley's présente fréquemment des conteurs, des chansonniers et bien d'autres. Que faites-vous encore là à lire cet avis?"}
{"text":"A dark tavern, style bar. Friendly and fast service.  The poutine here was very good. French fry's dark golden brown, almost burnt, with a snap when you bite into them. The gravy was thick and hot and the cheese curd was delicious."}
{"text":"Great Irish Nachos. The drink selection was amazing, but with the snow storm outside, I did not want to get into a second (or more) drink. Solid atmosphere as expected. Great basement feel."}
{"text":"The New York steak was pretty good and the server was super nice. Pretty quick service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"By all means this is the most authentic Irish pub in Montreal. This feeling is even stronger if you end up in the pub in the early afternoon when the music is very low volume and people quietly mind their business over a pint. Two floors with several bars, different sets of tables and some cosy sections, certainly a pub you can find your preferred place to sit and enjoy your Guiness. The black creamy liquid is not a single choice in the pub, endless list of beers on tap, nice variety of whiskeys makes it perfect place to meet friends and enjoy your time together. There is a life music every night, the best is when you end up listening to some of the resident bands who have warmed up so many Christmas parties with some of my best buddies at work. Well Hurley's certainly brings memories if you have been visiting long enough. The five stars for the pub are because of our bar tender yesterday, she did a wonderful demo how to poor slowly Guinness and took care of the fire when for the first time in so many years I finally made it to the most wanted spot in this pub during the winter, the magic fire place."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Hurley's Irish Pub.  It's a cute pub.  There was a Celtic band playing in little room we were in ... and they were really good!  Gord ordered a burger and onion rings.  He said they were really good.  I ordered wings (medium) and a half order of nachos with tomatoes and cheese.  Both were fun and delicious.  Alison was our server and she took good are of us."}
{"text":"very good bar. the food is great and not all that expensive. if you want a beer, a black and tan is definitely the way to go. the live bands they have are usually great and the staff is very accommodating."}
{"text":"Traditional Irish pub with plenty of little character filled rooms spread amongst two floors.  Surprisingly large from the inside.  We came here for drinks after a walk around downtown.  Diverse group of six who asked for all kinds of odd drinks to be made and the staff were were very kind and helpful and did their best to accommodate.  Reasonable pricing on the drinks and service was fast.  We would visit again."}
{"text":"Mark and Anna were the best. Took care of us all night, made sure we weren't too hungover the next morn by keeping that water flowing.   Great stories, very welcoming would come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Loved this spot, came by myself while traveling and the bartender and regulars took me in as one of their own.  The Guinness was delicious and the shepherds pie was hearty as well."}
{"text":"Pas mal bien comme place, très grand, y'a beaucoup de place, ça rappelle le côté labyrinthe des foufs mais clairement version Irish. C'était juste méga occupé aujourd'hui! Le staff est vraiment fin, Lolas, la waitress était vraiment fine, j'pense qu'a m,'aime, joke! mais j'aime bien le côt gentil de la clientèle sympa des pubs.ça m'a coûté un bras et une jambe, quand je me saoule, je suis en mode TOUT LE MONDE doit avoir un drink en tout temps, c'est bien et mal pour mon portefeuille, mais quand la vit est bien partagé C'est hot! bonne ambiance, stafff friendly, prix bien typique de downtown là."}
{"text":"This bar is ok. The drinks here a bit expensive and the service is pretty average. They got some live music here too and one of the only legit Irish accent bartenders in all of downtown Irish pubs in Montreal.  They also serve food here which includes Irish breakfast on weekends. The place is dark inside and has a traditional Irish pub feel which I don't mind."}
{"text":"Now it very well could've been that we were there watching the Habs beat the Penguins in a brilliant game 7 of round 2 and every person in this city is on absolute fire ... but damn we had a blast at Hurley's :). We started upstairs for a crowded, standing room only bar to watch the game.  My theory worked to make friends with all of those around me during quieter times pre-game ... so that the jumping and dancing and screaming wouldn't seem like it was coming from a complete stranger (that'd be me).  To my delight, the entire bar saw eye to eye with the losing your mind system upon each beautiful Montreal goal scored, or Halak save, or hit ... the Irish and English \"football\" guys standing near us were thoroughly entertained by how we, the educated hockey in our souls types, could \"see\" the goals (in fact I refered at one point that I could taste a goal coming, about 5 seconds before ---- il laaaaannnnncccee llleee buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuutttt!!!!!) ... i explained to them that it was kinda like soccer, uhm football, just so much faster, more exciting and guys don't fall down after an imaginary hit to hold their leg and do their best pain scream, face, wimper and pansy-ass limp to get up.  We accept an extra penalty if you make the guy bleed kind of fairness.    These bartenders are absolute pros.  I was kicking him a reasonable/nice $20 for 2 pints of kilkenny each round, until my friend Tanya was left in the dust ... ($4 tip), and I merely had to make eye contact from 3 rows back before my new friends would pass pints back my way.    After the game I was happy to find the downstairs, larger pub with a solid live band ... fiddler, marmonica, the works.  Met many cool new ppl and we stomped and danced . . . I recall a bit of a Riverdance segment . . . and oh, drank and drank.    This is the experience you want at a pub.  Thanks Hurley's.  Now if I could only remember that shwarma and poutine place I could Yelp about it ... i'll have to go back for a wander to try to retrace my steps and I'll find that one.  It was brilllliiant at about 4am!"}
{"text":"Lorsque je pense Pub Irlandais, mon cur se dirige immédiatement vers le Hurley's! Que ce soit pour un rendez-vous amoureux, une discution passionnée avec des copines, un lunch avec tes parents ou pour écouter de la musique traditionnelle irlandaise, c'est l'endroit parfait!  Ses plusieurs salons offrent une multitudes d'ambiances, et il y a même un feu de foyer à l'étage supérieur.  Leur sélection de bière est traditionnelle, sans aucunes surprises mais des choix efficaces pour un pub irlandais.  Leurs frittes patates douces sont un délices et j'adore m'y arrêter quelques heures entre deux tempêtes de neiges!"}
{"text":"On a recent pilgrimage back to the motherland, I met up with a bunch of old friends from the hood and we went to Hurley's for finger food and drinks. Somehow I blinked and it was 1am.  Food was OK, drinks were in my hand and the band played in another room so we hardly heard them.  It's a bar on Crescent street in Montreal in the Summer during Jazz Fest and it wasn't packed with teenagers... all good in my book."}
{"text":"The bar, food and atmosphere were amazing.  Alex the day time bartender on the first floor bar was awesome.   Really looking forward to going back here one day."}
{"text":"I really had a good time at this pub. You have extremely cool live Irish music, nice selection of beers, lovely staff and cool atmosphere. The only downside is that they have porter beer only in bottles but I can live with that. The beer is a bit pricey (about 7-8$ per pint), I heard the burgers are not amazing but the stews are and they make great fries. SO if you are looking for a place to have a good time, enjoy great vibes and drink cold beer...you just found it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for an old pub feel with live music and good drinks. The people in there were nice and the waitresses are cool."}
{"text":"Finalement remise de la Saint-Patrick, j'en profite pendant que la mémoire est encore fraîche pour rédiger mon avis. J'y suis allée avec une gang de Yelpeurs pour des pintes de Guinness, des « Blacks velvets » et du Jamieson. Le pub est typique d'un pub irlandais: très sombre, décoré avec des foulards des équipes de rugby préférées, et des enseignes de Guinness un peu partout. Les prix sont très bien et les bières sont bonnes. La musique est pas pire en plus, il y a deux terrasses où passer un bel après-midi ensoleillé (il y en a une petite à l'arrière qui est chauffée les journée plus froides.) J'y retournerais certainement pour la Saint-Patrick!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends.  We walked in one open door, and stood around. Nobody checked on us.  We went in another door, and waited around to be greeted. No ody did. Eventually the bartender told us to just grab a table. As we entered, we marveled at the Irish atmosphere, we got menus and beer list quickly.  We ordered our food.  I went with the Guinness stew, and an appetizer of the stinger dip.  I also ordered a Smirnoff ice. (not the fru-fru girly drink it is in the state, but a much more potent and tasty vodka-made drink in CA) We got the dip shortly after, and it was quite delicious.  Whatever herbs and components they added to the hot sauce worked to weaken it's potent-ness. It was great. Bread to dredge through the sauce soaked up the favors wonderfully.      My Guinness stew was also very good. It was thick like a heavy sauce,  with large chunks of beef and carrots and tomatoes and potatoes. Not anywhere near a soup consistency. That was when service started to drop off.       The waitress came by less and less after we got our food.  At one point we realized we had been waiting nearly an hour for our last drink orders we had placed. A band arrived while we were eating. Ok, so it's an Irish pub, with Irish food, and a nice Irish feel....was kinda messed up when the band broke out with a Bob Dylan song, and then a Beetles song.  Really nice guys, and their music was good, but their music just didn't mesh well with the atmosphere of the place. I actually asked one of the band members how I went about paying our bill, as it'd been a good forty-five minutes before we saw our waitress again.  One of the band members actually got up and went over to the owner and asked for us.      To recap: Great great food,  Great great Irish atmosphere, service is spotty at best. Great place overall, just try to keep a short leash on the waitress."}
{"text":"Long wait for a waitress to take our order and an inordinate amount of time waiting for her to bring two Guinnesses to the table. And then a long wait for the check. We were going to stay and order some food but bailed. I don't be back.  No wi-fi, or at least if there was, I wasn't able to connect to it."}
{"text":"4.5  I've never been to Ireland but stories, pictures and reviews have led me to believe that what I experienced at Hurley's is as close to the real things as I can get in North America. Raucous. Bawdy. Loud. Festive. Hurley's is all these things and more. We didn't arrive until late and left after last call. Our waitress was in no rush to kick us out. Her brogue was so lovely to hear. Behind my booth, a quartet of loud, ornery fellows drank like fish, cursed like sailors and collapsed on to each other in a fit of hysterical storytelling that comes with age, years of friendship... and lots of booze.  I loved it.  I know people come here for food but it wasn't that kind of party. I started with a pint of Kilkenny, transitioned to a Snakebite and ended the evening with a beer cocktail I'd never had before: stout (Guinness) + chambord. I think it's called a Black Fog. A bit sweet and girly but at that time of night after the night I'd had... who cares. I was carousing, telling tales, yelling, and being drunkbelligerent. It was awesome.  Imbibing so much beer caused me to wander around looking for a bathroom. As I did so, I had the chance to check out the pub. It had the wood & stone that would fit easily in to a city of age and history. Around every nook and cranny (or, you know, corner) there was another story to discover. I was particularly interested by the outside space, upstairs bar (and closed off areas), brick archways, and brilliant woodwork found in/at the bar/booth area. I'm, typically, not a fan of Americanized Irish pubs because they feel inauthentic and as though they're trying way too hard. This isn't the case at all at Hurley's. From my novice opinion, this is the real deal and it's easy to see why it's such a beloved Montreal institution. I'd gladly come back. I would just come earlier in the evening, eat some food and prepare to stay there all night, getting loud, drinking beer, challenging strangers, and telling stories. Sláinte!"}
{"text":"We went there on Friday night with a group.  First 10 people arrived in time. The friends came back to back after and the girl who took the orders started complaining... She couldn't follow the orders. I know it's not easy but pls don't do it front of the customers.  First of all it was a reservation so I didn't really understand why they couldn't put someone there who is ready for this kind of job and pressure also.  The girl was nice except when she was making faces... After the drink which was good (cider and Grand Marnier) I got my Murph burger. It was really disappointing... Thanks god I got with poutine. It was ok.  I really like Irish pubs, but it's not gonna be my favourite. Sorry but it's maximum 3* from me... I don't think so I'm coming back."}
{"text":"This is an enormous Irish pub.  We pretty much opened the place on a Sunday and sat outside to people watch and toss a few back.  The servers were great and didn't mind chatting up the tourists and giving some suggestions for later on that night.  Food was OK.  We ordered the Stinger dip, little bit greasy, spicy, but good enough as an app.  Not a lot of food choices here so eat first."}
{"text":"We came here we on the advice of a friend and we left impressed. It is quite large but has a great warm feel to the bar. We got seats on the upstairs balcony and service was friendly and quick. They offer Ploughman's lunches which was a score with us. A nice size and fresh bread and cheeses. Their French Onion Soup was delicious- they do not scrimp on the cheese at all.  Very fun feel with good food."}
{"text":"Ok Bill Hurley has been named Irishman of the year, so needless to say that this is the place to start when naming the best Irish Pub's in Montreal, Located in the basement of the building it is a large space with various little rooms.  You can access the second floor but there is no real bar atmosphere, better to stay downstairs, unless your there to eat. Hurley's open very early and closes very late, they have very good live music, guaranteed to make the (slightly warmed up Irishman/women), tear up as they sing along. During the St-Patty's day events, they open up some outdoor space in the back to make more room.  The food is actually good for pub fair and the prices are reasonable."}
