{"text":"This is very good pizza as it's a top notch for fast food.  When one compares fast food to gourmet, it's like comparing fancy Chinese banquet to Mandarin Buffet so I can't comment on Vanessa V. review since she doesn't mention whether it's gourmet or fast food since they use different types of ovens and preparation.  Manhattan New York pizza's does have a good reputation but my friend (also a life long New Yorker) took me to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.   It is also rated the highest in New York which I definitely enjoyed but would not say it's that much better than our best here and she agreed when I took her to Terroni.

Terroni's, Camarras ,Gerrard Pizza are my favourite gourmet places and they will give any New York pizzeria a run for it's money but that's the bottom line since gourmet is defined by price.  Anyways, people have different tastes when it comes to pizza but the important thing is a good pizza maker, fresh dough, good ingredients and a clean quality oven.  Wood or brick ovens tend to be better but they are not the most efficient ovens for fast food operations.

This is where I like Panago (Canadian operation based out of BC).  Clean, simple, fast and tastes great.  Look on the bottom of your crust and no burn marks so their ovens are clean.  The dough is made fresh on site daily and they don't put trans fats or MSG in their pizza which makes all the difference in the taste.  Ingredients are likely not fresh but I'm not sure if the gourmet places throw out everything they don't use at the end of the day and give you fresh picked from their backyard garden either so Andy O. may need to bring his own fresh ingredients to taste fresh.  He is right about the map but that has to do with the address not indicating Gerrard east or west.  I've sent in a correction as it is located on Gerrard St. West.  Definitely 4 stars and yes the Buffalo Chicken is awesome and worth the slightly higher prices."}
{"text":"I had their chipotle chicken Pizza slice as a takeout, went to s meeting and ate it it was so good at break I went back and got another slice. Always fresh, delicious and the staff is warm and friendly. Will go back often."}
{"text":"From the west coast and have been missing this pizza! So happy that they are coming to Ontario.  Awesome toppings, crust, and dip.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Now bring one to Stoney Creek!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in Panago Pizza. We ordered a large pepperoni and was charged 15.25. my husband arrived at the store in Beacon Hill to find that pizza on special for 10 bucks. Location would not honour the posted advertised price, because we had ordered online. Called to complain and was told they were unable to credit us the difference. Unable? Yeah right, more like simply unwilling. I guess they figured they already had our money. We love Panago Pizza, however if this is how they are going to treat their loyal customers we will need to find another pizza joint. Boo Panago!"}
{"text":"This place is clean, service attitude is alright. The owner isnt too familiar with the pizzas but is very nice about it. I will be returning because of its long hours. Weekday open till 11. Fri-Sat till midnight."}
{"text":"There are a lot of pizza places around my house. Some belongs to chains and franchises, some are independent family owned, some pizzas tasted like cardboard dough, some are topped with cheese so chemically altered that it should be call cheese at all. After recieving flyers from Panago for about 3 months, we have decided to order from the latest location of Panago based on the advertisement on the flyers,\" support real, wholesome pizzas\" with \"no fake flavours and colours or added MSG\".

We ordered via phone, hassle free and fast delivery. Since I feel compelled to list down all the ingredients of these wholesome pizzas, please bear with the long list. We had plain cheese pizza, garden veggie (Italian tomato sauce, black olives, saut√©ed mushrooms, roasted garlic, pineapple, green peppers, fire-roasted tomatoes, red onions + mozzarella), primo pollo  (pesto sauce, grilled chicken, fire-roasted tomatoes, red peppers, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, formaggio blend + mozzarella), veggie Korma (Indian korma sauce, roasted garlic, spinach, green peppers, pineapple, banana peppers, mozzarella+cheddar), Mediterranean salad as well as their Caesar salad with a choice of 5 dressings to choose from.  Since I am not a big fan of salad and I didn't had any, you can read up more about the greens on their website (panago.ca). The pizzas were thin crust, and also came with little round pack of Italian herb seasoning as well as dried chili flakes which I personally think that ALL pizza should be delivered together with. 

The veggie korma was a hit, by the time I came down for dinner (only 5 min late), there was only 1 slice left in the box. The crust is a good replacement for naan bread. Sometimes fusion or \"innovative\" food can easily scream disaster for the palate (do you recall Domino's Oreo Cookie Pizza?), this one is as genius as curry poutine in gastro pub, in a good way, since cheese add richness to the curry/korma sauce. It's not that spicy even though there's a \"fire\" sign next to the item, just a nice touch of hotness to the pizza. 

The garden veggie had some fans too, especially among kids that usually only eat pepperoni and cheese pizza. I liked the blend of cheeses. 

Love the pesto sauce in primo pollo. The chicken tasted great, bonus for not turning into those dried up tasteless thing on the usual pizza. It might be a little pretentious to mention that they use fire roasted tomatoes instead of just tomatoes, but it really helps with the flavor. 

Though we enjoyed the pizzas, the only problem we have is that \"no ....added MSG\" advertisement on their flyers. One of my friends is actually allergic to MSG, which is the main reason why we decided to try Panago instead of the usual pizza places that we order from. However, he still felt some reactions after eating the pizzas. I am by no means accusing Panago of misleading and false advertisement since no added MSG could mean that they do not add MSG to anything they made. That however, doesn't eliminate the fact that perhaps some of the sauces that they use (which I do not assume they made it from scratch) may have contain MSG, or MSG disguised under another name. It's a little disappointing because we thought that we found a place where we can order without any allergic reaction worries. I guess it's just unavoidable that fast foods do come in contact with MSG or whatever they like to call themselves. 

 Overall, I think Panago pizzas are above average in Toronto, but there's still ample room for improvement in order to toss out a good pizza."}
{"text":"Ordering from Panago for the second time, my mouth was drooling in anticipation for their pizza. I was hoping and crossing my fingers that it would be as good as I remembered it. 
I sadly found out after digging into their pizza that they did not deliver my taste buds justice the second time around. They do real well in using fresh toppings for their pizzas but this time, their cooking was misplaced somewhere else. The bread was rather dry and tasted like powder, there wasn't enough cheese and half of my pizza was oily on the bottom. Sorry to say Panago.... but you really let me down :( This could have resulted from the pizza being made fairly quickly -- between 20 to 45 minutes (Delivery). The pizza tasted okay, but definitely not as great as I remembered but they have a good variety and is moderately priced"}
{"text":"I have gotten takeout from Panago on several occasions and every time has been delicious. I am not a fan of \"chain\" pizza (Pizza Pizza, Pizza Hut, etc) and Panago provides an alternative that is so much better for around the same price. 
Their vegetables are fresh, chicken tastes like real chicken and their Italian sausage is actually delicious. 
Also, the service when we pick up is always friendly and fast without fail."}
{"text":"We had vegetarian Garden Pizza yesterday.  The place looked amazing and very clean.  The guy explained the menu and asked how we liked the Pizza as we were leaving after the very last bite.  The pizza was very tasty and had all the right amount of toppings.  It was much better than Pizza Pizza, Pizza Nova, and 241 PIZZA.  My kids loved it!!  Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"I visit this place quite regularly as I work nearby and this place makes great pizza every time.  For first timers who has never been here, they make their pizza fresh every time.  A personal sized pizza is around $7 and it definitely hits the spot if you are craving for some pizza.  Their menu is pretty big and all their toppings are fresh and the crust crispy done to perfection.  The wait time is a bit long but there is an option to order online or by phone which makes it very convenient."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Panago for years, however I'm never ordering from them again.

The last two times have been such a nightmare, they ought to be ashamed of themselves.

---The short version of this review is if you are considering ordering pizza from them, just punch yourself in the nuts a few times and eat nothing and you'll still come out ahead.

---The long version...

The first disaster of a time, I ordered a couple pizza's to be delivered at my apartment because my wife and I were exhausted.  An hour and a half after, I get a call from the delivery guy saying he's in the lobby, but the buzzer's broken so can I let him in?  I go down to my lobby, and no delivery guy.  I checked my buzzer and it was working.

I walked outside my building and even down my block to see if he was in another building, but he wasn't there.  I called him back and told him I was down there, but I didn't see him, and he said that I took too long so he left.  I asked him to come back and said I would wait for him in the lobby.

I waited on the street, but never saw lights come down.  He called me back annoyed and said that he's in the lobby, but I'm not there.  So then I realized that he's obviously at the wrong place, so I asked him to confirm my address.  He was annoyed, but read me my correct address and said that obviously I got it wrong.  I told him I've lived here for a while, and I'm not wrong, I know my address.  He said maybe I just don't want my pizza...He suggested I go and look at some mail which pissed me right off.  I told him he should walk down the street and look at a street sign.

Then his manager (who spoke much better English thankfully) called and asked me to confirm my address.  I told him my address and told him that his guy is obviously at the wrong place.  He said he'd call his guy and straighten it out.

The delivery guy then called me back and started yelling asking me again what my address is.  I told him again and he just couldn't accept that he was in the wrong place and hung up on me.

I called his manager back and told him that I'm really not impressed with this guy.  I have a very simple address in an area that is very easy to get to.  This should not be a challenge.  The manager then said I would get the pizza's for free.

After I hung up with the manager, someone from Panago customer support called me trying to straighten this out.  He asked me to confirm my address, which I did and I even gave him directions to my place and he looked on Google maps while we were talking so there was no doubt about it.

Then the buzzer rang and it was the delivery guy.  He came up stairs and offered no apology and then passed me the debit machine.  I told him that his manager said the pizza's were free and he didn't believe me.  I told him to call his manager which he did and then he passed the phone to me.

In speaking with the manager, he said that the credit for the pizzas would be on my account with panago the next time I ordered.  I was fine with that and paid the guy sans a tip because I don't appreciate being yelled at.

That was the end of that and after two and a half hours of utter disgraceful service, we finally got to eat.



Tonight, I decided to order a couple pizza's and thought I'd use the credit I have with Panago.  I called Panago, and they have nothing on file for my phone number.  I told them that this had better get resolved because if it's not, I'm never buying from them again.

The lady put me on hold and tried to transfer me to customer service.  2 minutes later, she picked up and asked me when I was told I would get a credit.  I said I didn't remember.

She put me on hold again for another couple of minutes, and then my wife said I should just order from Stavros Pizza.  Once she said that I felt silly for waiting on hold at all.  Stavros makes far better pizza, I've never had an issue ordering from them, and they never put me on hold, so I hung up the phone and ordered from there.

The pizza was great and I've decided I'm never getting Panago again."}
{"text":"We were visiting Mississauga area and wanted to try Canadian Pizza. After a quick review of yelp ordered a large pizza with our own topping choices from this joint. 
    It was an underwhelming experience. The pizza was pricey, the toppings were barely adequate, the crust was only slightly more appetizing than cardboard and no dip.
    My young daughter who will scarf down pizza simply refused to finish her first slice... In one word ... it was disappointing!!"}
{"text":"These pizzas are good. The owners are very nice and always treat me very well when I come in. I like the personal pizzas and they cook them in front you. I like that u can see the kitchen is very clean. The prices are good too."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a chain pizza place, Panago should be your first and only stop. Fresh pizza, interesting toping combinations and affordable. I am so glad they chose Liberty Village as their next Toronto location. Delivery is super fast too."}
{"text":"The pizza was good enough but it tasted pretty much like a box pizza from the supermarket. So it satisfied a pizza craving but didn't deliver anything special or interesting. Too bad. However, gotta say it was delivered really quickly!"}
{"text":"We live in the condos right across the street and ordered from here the first time as we had run out of ideas of where to eat. Were we surprised!! It is definitely one of the best pizza I have ever eaten. What I am even more fond of is how they have such interesting toppings - Jambalaya, Taco, Butter Chicken, Buffalo Chicken, Chipotle. We have tried at least 7-8 different toppings and yet to find one which does not taste great. We are now regulars ."}
{"text":"You can tell the ingredients are better quality.  And for lunch I can order a whole pizza including tax for under ten bucks!  And they give you dipping sauce for free-  not many give you free stuff anymore,  Like."}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite 
I love the chipotle chicken pizza here
They deliver and they were accurate and brought the time I asked for
Prices are reasonable 
They've a variety of choices"}
{"text":"Panego 
Omg major disappointment 
Initial order arrives with disappointing amount of cheese on it 
The second attempt they didn't bring the Cesar salad  so by the time I got through to customer service the pizza was cold
So no Cesar salad and cold pizza

Panego I will never order there again

I'm so frustrated
19:15 still no food"}
{"text":"Given an order and waited for 1,5 hours. Then called the customer service and took a feedback that the store sent my delivery and I didn't pick up the phone for which i never received. Terrible service, this is the 2nd time, company doesn't care about the customer satisfaction i guess!!!"}
{"text":"Pan-a-go, Pan-ay-go?  Alas, I, and the world will never know.  What I do know is that the $5 personal pizza lunch special is Pan-a-win! Pan-ay-win? 

Tip: Chicken Club"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza!

If you're looking for quality pizza, Panago pizza will hit the spot. This new joint is small, clean and modern looking. They don't have a lot of seating inside- just a few stool seats around the window. The staff here is helpful and friendly.

Panago has a ton of pizza to choose from. Their prices are a tad bit high but it's worth it! They have a variety of vegetarian, chicken, other meat and seafood pizza to choose from; and of course you can create your own. 

I got their medium genoa classic pizza ($14.50). I ordered it in the store and it was handed over to me fresh out of the oven within 8 minutes! The genoa classic had a slightly crisp regular crust, passata tomato sauce, good amount of genoa salami, green & black fresh olives, a generous amount of goat cheese and mozzarella cheese- YUM!

I highly recommend Panago pizza. The quality and freshness of the ingredients is enjoybale. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Was recommended to try out Panago pizza and I'm so glad we did! I highly recommend their cheese bread, easily the highlight of the meal! Pizza was also very good. Price was very reasonable as well. Will definitely get again when we visit Toronto in a few years!"}
{"text":"Panago offers a half decent gluten-free crust, and vegan cheese is an option as well for those that are dairy free. I'd give it a 3.5 overall -- I can't wait for the day that there are gluten and dairy free options that taste as good as the real thing! Not bad Panago, not bad."}
{"text":"Not bad for Halal pizza! My only gripe is they should include more Halal options instead of the pork. Other than that pizzas here are really good. No dining area though so beware."}
{"text":"HAIR. Now that I have your attention, hair, in my motherf****g pizza. Not just ONE. I gave them the benefit of the doubt on the first one, it happens. But thoughout the entire pizza. Every slice.
So I called \"customer service.\" They asked to come pick up the pizza and that they would have it \"analyzed\" and \"get back to me\". NEVER DID. So grossed out, NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Usually, panago is great. But we just ordered two completely different pizzas, and both of them had hair in them. Not like one, but a couple of big disgusting long blonde hairs. Not my favourite thing to pull out of my mouth.

Called customer service, and the guy just really didn't seem to care at all. Told me that someone would have to come pick up the pizzas for \"analysis\" before they could so anything. Living in an apartment building, it's rather impossible for me to go dig though a trash compactor for gross hairy pizza. Then said that there was nothing else he could do.

Definitely never getting panago again. Hairy pizza and bad customer service? No thanks."}
{"text":"It was my worst experience ever! I placed an order for the pizza after my friend recommendation and I was so disappointed and surprised that someone can serve a pizza as the one which I had... the slack-baked cake like a chewing gum with the cheapest and fat ingredients, made this pizza really bad. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I dropped by today for the first time since they opened even though I live just next door. I tried the before-4-pm chipotle chicken (personal size) and pop combo. It's a nice serving size for a quick lunch and the toppings were paired tastefully. The dough reminds me of Pizza Hut, though not as greasy. Overall, it's one of the better pizzas I've had and the friendly staff really helped with the store image. I'd be coming back for lunch again soon."}
{"text":"Interesting toppings, great selection, nice decor, clean, pleasant and convenient.  Steps from Lcbo, No Frills and great shopping on Avenue Road."}
{"text":"The pizza is good as always, and I could nearly drink the Chipotle Cilantro sauce, it's so good.

The real reason I'm writing this is to compliment the staff.  Ken (the man who served me) was friendly and helpful.  We talked about sauce briefly, just making conversation, and he told me about a mix he does.  Because I took an interest, he went ahead and made some for me and surprised me with it, free of charge.  In addition, while my pizzas were cooking, he offered to show my 3 year old how to make her own pizza, and walked her through it while helping her.  That was also free, and it made her day.  The service from this location has made it my favorite one.  In my opinion, they deserve your business."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this location. Speedy service ( pickup or delivery) friendly staff, super clean and always good."}
{"text":"Ordering online is a breeze and delivery has always been super quick...even on weekends.

Good for groups or when you need something quick and easy."}
{"text":"Ordered this last night and it was as usual delicious. Me and my family like chipotle chicken and butter chicken. It comes with a lot of toppings and with different crusts. Best thing about it is you can order with halal meat which we prefer."}
{"text":"$6 personal pizza + pop made fresh. Hard to beat deal in downtown.

==========
EDIT: revised my review because the $6 deal is gone"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza joint. Close to Rogers centre. Perfect for post-game pizza. Pizza was fresh, service was quick and friendly. Went around 930p on a Saturday night. Pizza was ready in ten minutes. Lots of veggie options. Tried the Mediterranean veggie and definitely recommend it! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Delivery was 30 mins late; pizza room temperature when it got here. Called their hotline to ask the status of delivery at 30mins and was given a credit for the full amount for the next order which I thought was good customer service. Taste itself of the steak mushroom melt pizza- 2.5/5...think they use cheez-wiz as one of the cheeses on the pizza- not a big fan!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but not as good as I was hoping.  A friend was raving about it. Personally I would rather spend a little more at a mom and pop place where it tastes more home made. 
The speed and service was astounding.  
Out of the 3 pizzas I ordered the Quattro framaggio was the best one."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Prompt delivery. The only thing I would complain about is that they close too early at nights."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. The crust is a little too thick and bready for me. The Caesar salad is lettuce and a tiny pot of dressing. Not great. I had to primo capicollo. Or was not spicy at all despite the banana pepper and hot sausage topping. It's not bad for a quick dinner. I won't be hurrying back though. 

I am updating to include a review of the thin crust style pepperoni walk in special of 10$ for a large. Very good value and while still a reasonably thick base it was far better than the standard base imo. Staff are polite too."}
{"text":"My order took over an hour to arrive.  The driver called to say he'd be another 10 mins. Food arrived cold, and all of my sauces and drinks were forgotten. Then driver said he'd be back with drinks ten minutes later. Salad was missing all of my toppings and dressing. Garlic bread didn't have sauce on the side. I called the Airdrie location and gentlemen said he would credit my phone number. However I am moving away tomorrow morning so this won't even get to apply. Thoroughly disappointed in the service and quality of food. Would not recommend and would not order again."}
{"text":"Marketing campain worked on me.  Had a free slice at the GO station and then ordered with a coupon they gave me a few days ago.  Best pizza I've had in Oakville so far but that's not really saying much. Better than Pizza Pizza and along the lines of Pizza Delight.  Really good salads."}
{"text":"They have a really good pizza. It feels so fresh and the crust is just the perfect thickness"}
{"text":"Panago Pizza is my number one take-out pizza resonant. They have a virility of salads and pizzas to choose from. Quite unique pizza choices. Not to mention cheap as well."}
{"text":"This is most likely the best panago pizza spot in Calgary. 
The amount of dedication the staff put in is exemplary. The pizza is amazing. Someone about how they manage to put just enough toppings and sauce out beats the others"}
{"text":"This is some of the best chain pizza in the city.  Quality toppings that have been placed liberally on a crisp crust.  You pay a little more, but when you're in the mood, it's well worth it.  A couple of winners are the Chipotle Chicken and the Philly Steak, but I'm certain that there are many more."}
{"text":"I frequently order from these people and have not been disappointed--ever.

Delivery is prompt--usually less than 20 minutes from placing the order.

Recently I placed an order and it failed to go onward to the Gerrard St. store.
After an hour and a half, I telephoned their head office and learned that their connection
to the store was not working and the Gerrard St. location never received my order.

Profuse apologies and a free pizza for my inconvenience.  

These people are very diligent in all that they do and the quality of ingredients
are also an important factor in this rating of 5 stars.  

I highly recommend Panago."}
{"text":"We definitely like Panago Pizza more then others. They're succinct, efficient, polite and courteous when speaking over the telephone. Customer service works when you yourself are polite and courteous. Speaking to people is two lane highway and you shouldn't hesitate to be forthright and courteous.  Even when the delivery person arrives they don't become rude or have attitude if you don't."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service.  The pizza was made fresh and not busy at all.  I gave it a 3 just because there was nothing that challenged them to make them stand out like a busy lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza via their call-in number.  Had it timed for pickup at 7:15.  I arrive...no pizza. No record of my pizza order.  10 minutes after I arrive then the order shows up.  The manager however was quite accommodating and provided some juice boxes for my kids and some pizza dip for me.  I was impressed with the manager, just didn't like that I had to wait 10 minutes."}
{"text":"We got the medium gluten-free Garden Veggie pizza.  It tasted great, had plentiful toppings, and from what I could tell, was prepared considerately with regard to keeping the pre-made gluten free crust from coming into contact with floured surfaces or with other workers preparing ordinary pizzas.  I don't know if they also use a dedicated oven, but this much attentiveness would at least lead me to optimistically hope so.

Many gluten free pizza crusts share a similar grainy cardboard type of texture that has to be somewhat masked with ingredients, but this crust is actually pretty good in its own right and I'd be happy to eat it again.  The added +$4 fee for gluten free crust is a bit pricey, but if you have to eat gluten free, you're probably accustomed to higher costs and are just happy to have options outside your own kitchen.  

Although the gluten free sizes don't go above medium, our medium was easily what other restaurants would call a large, so it was a satisfying amount.  All in all, we'd be happy to eat here again and excited to try more of their topping combinations, with plenty to offer vegetarians and omnivores alike."}
{"text":"I wish this place had more locations, their pizza and cheesy bread is so good! Although they are a bit on the pricey side, its really worth it if you like pizza."}
{"text":"While visiting my mother in Etobicoke for a coffee at the Starbucks near Kipling subway station, I decided that, since I was tired and wanted something quick, I would try Panago pizza. It's two doors down from the Starbucks, and I've always heard it was decent pizza.

I walked in, and you could tell this is a higher class pizza place, if \"high class pizza\" can actually coexist together. The kitchen was clean, the seating area was clean, the place was a very nice white and steel.

Browsing the menu, the prices seemed very reasonable. Your basic cheese and pepperoni personal pizza was $4.25 (plus tax). This is what I ordered. I was told it'd be about ten minutes for the pizza, so we sat and chatted.

The pizza was done on time; I opened the box it came in, and it was the most dull looking pizza I've ever seen. You'd think an independent place (granted, Panago isn't a one-off and is a chain, but not a major chain) would have delicious looking pizza; but no. It's as uniform as what you'd get at Pizza Hut, or Dominoes, or any other corporate chain. The taste of it matched the look; bland and boring. Now, cheese and pepperoni are inherently bland and boring, granted, but this was exceptionally bad, so I purchased one of their shakers (they had sea salt, which I got, as well as four other flavours), and it added some flavour, but overall, it was very average.

In the future, I would go to Panago on a whim, or I would suggest it to a friend who wants to eat cheap and quick, but it's not somewhere I'd go to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Ordered first time from this place. Great tasting pizzas. Well within time frame . Skipped big lineups due to canada day fireworks. we will def. order again."}
{"text":"The bestttt pizza . top quality toppings. Amazing sauces and cheeses. Can order online or in person. So so so Much better than pizza pizza or frozen pizzas. Definitely my to go pizza place. I usually get the philly steak one! Also I forgot to mentioned. That they have a lot of good flavored pizzas with chunks of steak and not little bits and pieces!"}
{"text":"So the weather is garbage out or maybe you're a little hungover or maybe you're having a movie night? Sometimes life just calls for a pizza night.

I like Panago pizza for delivery. The pizza quality is consistent and it's not to bad for a chain. My favorite things about ordering from here are the thin crust (a must when I want to be a glutton - it seems to make me feel a bit better post pizza binge, less bread = less pizza bloat) and the free dips. The delivery is pretty much always quicker than the time quoted, they do debit or credit at the door - which comes in so handy when you blew your wad at the bar last night anyways.

We have ordered from Panago for years, in Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, Kelowna.... and consistency is what you get. I have tried tons of the pizzas on their menus. I like that they try to come up with new, original pizzas and I often fall for them when I see them on the menu.  We like some of their chicken ones, Hawaiian ones, veggie ones....half and half seems to be the norm for us these days, there are always to many drool worthy choices.

Yes, it's chain pizza. Don't expect an artisan pizza but do expect something with a bit more quality than other delivery style pizza chains. It's a bit pricier but I think its worth it.

Oh. And I'm giving it 5 stars because if I compare it to the pizza thats in it's league - I like Panago the best (better than pizza hut, dominoes, 73..etc...)."}
{"text":"Decent Pizza but way overpriced, $18.25 for a large pizza? a bit much . I found the pizza a bit tasteless really a lack of salt, I would return if the price was lower, I will continue going to usual Dominos or Pizza Nova much more value for your $"}
{"text":"All pizza is pretty equal. Panago is not the exception. It is not the bad pizza, but it is also nothing special. The question is, why it is x2 expensive then others \"not-to-bad\" pizzas in Toronto?  I love Personal size Meatball Cheazzy."}
{"text":"I think reviews must be from staff or friends...gross pizza and wings.  Didn't even get the order right for wings (ordered BBQ and got plain - who orders plain?!??!).
Ewww."}
{"text":"I ordered Panago pizza for delivery last night at the new Liberty Village location and I was impressed by the prompt and efficient service.  Ordering over the phone was a breeze and the customer service representative even offered suggestions to the meal as we were unsure what sides to get.

Within 30 minutes the pizza arrived!  We were shocked how fast the order was processed.  Their breadsticks were awesome, they were the twisty and soft kind.  Our vegetarian with meat-free pepperoni pizza was off-the-hook (yes, I just used that term and I am trying to bring it back to life).

I will definitely be a return customer!"}
{"text":"I occasionally order from here but I feel like when you put lots of toppings on a customized pizza, they sometimes tend to miss out one or two. This kinda bothers me but maybe I'm too nice to call them back and complain about it. They might think customers are dumb to notice it. Oh well.. Also, they are inconsistent with the amount of toppings they put. At times, they are being way too stingy on their toppings. On occasion, their wings aren't fully cooked so bear that in mind. (Their wing size isn't also consistent. Don't worry though. When you receive tiny wings, they'd be fully cooked.)

With all that being said, there are times when things go the right way and you can't stop ordering from them."}
{"text":"I arrived at your restaurant on 17th ave in Calgary AB at 12:28am on a Saturday night/Sunday morning (June 25). Your advertised closing time is 1 am. The door was locked and your employees gave hand gestures that the store was closed and you would not be accepting new orders/customers (waving hand back and fourth across their neck - are they part of the mafia???). This is unacceptable behaviour of employees and not the service I expect from Panago. The lazy attitude of your employees reflects your corporate culture. Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza, I really like the \"Personal Size\" for about $6, ready in less than 10 minutes, so much better to eat fresh rather than the other places with hours-old crusty \"slices\".

Also has many Vegetarian & Halal options making it welcoming to all.

There's a counter & stools by the window for eat-in, but not really a place for group dining.

Panago is a Chain so get some great pizza now before they become too big & the inevitable drop in quality, believe it or not, way back when, PizzaPizza USED to be good too!"}
{"text":"I should have just eaten cardboard with sauce and cheese on it. Worst pizza ever. And does the lady at the till need to be so freakin angry??"}
{"text":"Panago Pizza is a new chain of pizza joints in Toronto. Already a well known chain on the the west coast of Canada, this upscale take-out pizza chain has landed in Toronto, and it's delicious! 

The pizza is a little more expensive than your typical pizza joints, but the pizza itself is much better too. They have healthy crust options including thin crust, multi-grain and multi-grain thin crust. The location is clean and new, and the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming.

We ordered the steak and mushrooms melt pizza, WOW was it ever good!! I would definitely recommend giving it a try. We also had the primo pollo on thin multi-grain crust which was pretty tasty too (check out the pictures).

If you're the kind of person that doesn't order pizza very often, spend the few extra dollars and get some quality pizza. The pizza is amazing!

***TIP: They have $3 small, $5 medium and $7 large cheese or pepperoni pizzas if you order any of their large pizzas***"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location when staying late at work. I like their pizza as they have soooo many good options.

I have tried their:

Veggie Korma Pizza - Coconut curry sauce, roasted garlic, baby spinach leaves, green peppers, pineapple, hot banana peppers, mozzarella + cheddar cheese.

Veggie Mediterranean Pizza - Fresh pasta tomato sauce, fire-roasted tomatoes, kalamata olives, red peppers, baby spinach leaves, red onions, feta cheese + mozzarella.

Pesto Shrimp Pizza - Pesto sauce, wild pink shrimp, roasted garlic, fire-roasted tomatoes, black olives + mozzarella cheese.


All these pizzas had a very distinct taste and the combinations went very well."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie korma pizza and also wanted to order the butter chicken pizza, but was told it was no longer on the menu.  Was disappointed, but decided to give the beef taco pizza a try.  My husband & couldn't even finish 1 piece of this pizza...was horrible.  Not sure if it was suppose to come seasoned perhaps...but it was subpar unseasoned ground beef with mostly chopped lettuce & big hunks of raw tomato.  I feel like this has potential but fell really flat.  We tried sprinkling a bit of cumin & chili powder on our piece, but it still was not good enough to have another piece.  The veggie korma was good, so we'll give 2 stars"}
{"text":"I went to Panago Pizza tonight for the first time and was so disappointed!!!! The service was horrible. The pizza was soggy and there were barely any toppings on the pizza. Not to mention the chicken wings were under cooked and probably the smallest and worst I've ever had. I would not recommend the Gerrard street location to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken pizza was OK but I ordered extra chicken and.... it's like they never got the memo. Definitely NOT worth spending the $ on extra toppings here!"}
{"text":"I've always been a Pizza Hut/Little Cesars girl. I don't know what happened to me this weekend, but I was feeling ballsy. So I ventured into the dark side and decided to switch things up.

I ordered pizza from Panago...this may not SEEM like a big deal to the average pizza-eater, but for me to deviate my pizza carrier is a HUGE deal.

Can I just say how unexpectedly pleased I was?!?!??! 

I ordered the Primo Vegetarian pizza with banana peppers on top, along with a couple of Grapple juices on the side. The total bill came to about $25, including the tip, and we had food for 2 days. 

The primo veggie pizza was an EXCELLENT choice. Rather than the traditional tomato sauce, they use a special pesto sauce. MMMMM!

The crust was whole wheat, which I loved, and they used the perfect amount of cheese!  Also, I was told the pizza would be there in 45 minutes, and guess what? It Was.

I highly recommend Panago Pizza to anyone who is feeling gutsy and willing to try something new. There's nothing worse than deviating to something new but wishing all along that you had gone with your regular, but I promise you, when it comes to Panago, this wont be the case."}
{"text":"love it because it's the only vegan pizza available for delivery in Calgary. probably also the only vegan pizza in town overall"}
{"text":"I'm having a love affair with Panago.

I didn't jump on the bandwagon until just recently, but now that I'm on it, NO CHANCE of gettin' me off this bad boy.

Their pizza is DELICIOUS! It's not greasy or gross (multigrain crust is an option), and the toppings and combinations are creative and original. Plus who DOESN\"T love the dipping sauces that come with the pizza?!?!?

I've ordered from this place a number of times and I've NEVER had a problem.

The service is efficient and excellent, and the pizza makes my soul happy.

What else could you ask for from a pizza joint ?!?!"}
{"text":"Panago Pizza is one of my favourite chain pizza stores. I usually get the Veggie Korma pizza and everyone that tries it falls in love with it. Everything tastes fresh and they have an open kitchen so you can see them make the pizza.

The store is small with limited seating (a small row along the window). There are no slice pizzas so you have to order a whole pizza off the menu. It would be nice to see a menu of all the pizzas more visible than just a small 8.5\" by 11\" sheet of paper.

Recommendation: get the pizza delivered and eat it in the comfort of your own home."}
{"text":"Excellent Primo Vegetarian Pizza!! I highly recommend it, nice toppings and nicely baked crust."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Panago I was very skeptical, I was under the impression it was just another run of the semolina mill pizza joint, and I was wrong!

I was blown away by my first Panago experience which left me wanting more after I finished my S-10'' pizza and was comfortably bloated. 

Panagopoulos has a neat history: Firstly it's Canadian! And was born in BC. Now they boast nearly 200 location across Canada, surely they must be doing something right. A few years back they also stepped up their game by introducing Panago Cucina, a take-home product line featuring balsamic vinegar, EVOO, various sauces and salts.

The one pizza I swear by at Panago is the New York Deli because I'm a raging carnivore, slaying everything from Ostrich to Pterodactyls. The NYD features Italian tomato sauce, pepperoni, Genoa salami, bacon, Canadian ham, spicy Italian sausage, mozzarella + cheddar. Just a beloved gongshow of salty goodness. The dough was nice and fluffy, (a nice change from all the napoli style thin crust I am used to devouring), and the sauce was rich and everything was seasoned well. Panago is up there for my favourite fast food pizzas without a doubt. 

Yes the price may appear to be somewhat high @ $11.50 for a S-10\", but it's worth every penny. This is not a pizza you would eat every day, and truthfully if you're very hungry the 10' will do you proper. 

Thumbs up no doubt."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Quick delivery! This might be our regular place going forward. 

My fav:
1. Buffalo Chicken Pizza. 
2. Butter Chicken Pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place.
They offer vegan pizza.  It is REALLY hard to find a place with vegan pizza.  They even have vegan pepperoni with vegan cheese.  Amazing!!!  One of the things I miss most about being vegetarian is pepperoni pizza.
Delivery was QUICK!  It said 50 minutes and it arrived in 25 minutes.  Wow.
A bit pricier than an average pizza.  But it was delicious and vegan!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza and it came on time but they forgot my dips, forgot to add bacon to one pizza and while I asked for no jalape√±os on the other, they put jalape√±os on it anyway. Terribly disappointed. You can see on my receipt the order was taken correctly."}
{"text":"What a surprise! Yknow those Panago flyers that get delivered every few weeks into your mailbox, that you throw out, but not without glimpsing at the menu..  and can't help but notice how damn TASTY everything sounds? Well it tastes even BETTER!

I happened to be very hungry in Crowfoot one day and saw their \"One personal pizza plus a pop for $6\" deal posted on their store window. We all know by now that I love deals, so this was a no-brainer. I was starving, so I ordered the first thing I saw on the menu, which happened to be the \"Super Cheezy Meatball\". Normally I'd snicker or squawk at these ridiculous overly-American names, but heck, just give me my meatball pizza, I'm STARVED.

It was a gruelling 10 minute wait, during which I kept bugging the guys making the pizza with \"How much longer??\" and \"OH my.. I'm going to DIE of starvation if I wait any longer\". The guys rightfully ignored my dramatic exclamations and handed me my pizza when it was ready. I snatched it from their hands, opened the box and dug in. OH my god it was SO GOOD! Seriously, it was an intense moment for me. Even with a name such as \"Super Cheezy Meatball\", this pizza was ROCKING my WORLD. I hardly shared any with my boyfriend and DEVOURED the pizza. 

Seriously, for $6.. a pop and an out-of-this-world pizza?! I'm a FAN!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza - the korma veg could have been better if it had spice but other than very good. Their dipping sauces were awesome as well!"}
{"text":"They said that they're going to contact me about our food poisoning weeks later ....::.still waiting ordering   Pizza  tonight; but not from panago 
I used to like pango 
they've upset me so much farther 
With their don't give a damn 

1- false claims of ingredient and bad ingredients that made  us sick !"}
{"text":"The only pizza in Toronto that doesn't suck.
When I moved to Canada, I was horrified at the stuff that is often consumed under the name of \"pizza\". After 15 years, I've finally found a pizza in the city worth eating. 

The crust tastes great (note, it has taste unlike the cardboard crust found at other chains) and has a nice texture. The toppings are amazing--so many choices. You can tell they're actually fresh.

As a vegetarian, I appreciate the many options for us... even veggie pepperoni. My favorite is the Primo Vegetarian. I love the pesto in place of marinara. Ok, so I have no idea if the meat is good, but it's ok... you'd make your mamma proud by eating veggies. They do have several interesting options for carnivores, I'm sure some of them must be yummy.

I wish I hadn't started writing this review... now I want to order a pizza!"}
{"text":"I've always passed by this place while going in and out of Centerpoint mall. This day I was craving pizza and decided to give this place a shot. Clean and brand new looking, with a lot of variety. There are plenty of pizzas, salads, and wings on the big shiny board wall menu. You can even order a personal sized pizzas! I ordered a personal sized pizza and a drink combo, my boyfriend ordered a fajita and drink combo (which came out looking like pizza). The pizza I ordered was called the Veggie Korma, and it was absolutely delicious. I ordered it because it sounded unique. It had 
Coconut curry sauce, roasted garlic, baby spinach leaves, green peppers, pineapple, hot banana peppers, mozzarella, and cheddar. So much flavour, it was sweet and a bit spicy with a nice juicy crunch from the fruit/veggies. My boyfriend liked mine way better than his, as my pizza made his fajita taste bland. Safe to say we'd both come back for the Veggie Korma alone haha, but I also think it's worth going back to try other menu items as well."}
{"text":"When I phoned it was a bit difficult as person on the phone couldn't understand my order and kept
Making mistakes ... however they redeemed themselves when the pizza
came fast and order was correct! Great pizza
Night!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, some of the best I've had. However, it is a bit more pricey than say pizza pizza, but the quality is better, so that's expected. It does take A LONG TIME to get your pizza, but that is because they make it fresh, right in front of you, so you can't speed that process up very much. One complaint I have that could be fixed is that whenever I go in the summer it's very very hot in the building, and there usually isn't any fans going, just an open door, and it's hot outside too, so that doesn't really help. It would be nice if they at least had a fan on hotter days. Other then that, it's a great place and I recommend it :)"}
{"text":"this location is really starting to slip. Lately the toppings have been sparse and/or thrown all right in the middle of the 'za, just all lumped together. Last week, ordered a NY Deli meat pizza with a few veggies added to it, the pie gets delivered with the veggies on it but no NY Deli toppings. Waited another 45 mins for a new one and it just tasted off. Did not finish it, nor the defective pizza, but I did not get sick either and thats a good thing. I gave an extra star  for that and also a star for customer service giving me a $17.50 credit even though I will not likely use it unless I move away. Thank you"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, we were looking for a quick dinner option and decided to try Panago.
We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza ($10) for takeout.
It came with a free dipping sauce.
This store has a pizza assembly line, so our order was ready in 15 min.

The pizza had a great dough with a soft crust.
The cheese was baked over the pepperoni (which I love).
All in all, this was a very yummy pizza that all 3 of us enjoyed.

Panago will see us again. ;)"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Awesome wings. I order from this Panago location frequently and it's always a good experience. And they are punctual."}
{"text":"I've already written a review for their Financial Dr location a few Km's away. If you're curious for what I have to say, you could check that out I suppose. But I finally made it to this one, and just as consistent as you'd hope AND they have a Yelp check-in deal ($5 off!).
Love Panago, and please come to Brampton."}
{"text":"I'm originally from BC, where Panago also originates. Out there, it's kind've like what Pizza Nova is out here; found almost everywhere, but a step up from the even more popular (but lesser quality) pizza chains. That being said, Panago is a step up from Pizza Nova.

I was thinking 5 stars may be slightly too high, since I wouldn't go out and say this is the best pizza I've ever had. But when reviewing to scale, Panago is comfortably ahead of its competition by some degree.

Great variety and quality ingredients. They also have it dead-on with the crust since it's not too dough-y; crispy without being greasy.

Funny thing is that I had never ordered a personal pizza in all the years I was in BC. Maybe they didn't have it? Today I ordered a pesto chicken. They make it all from scratch and even have the ball of dough which they throw down a press before creating the rest. Roasted tomatoes, garlic, pesto, caramelized onions, great cheeses...a tasty pizza with high quality ingredients. Outside of downtown, I doubt I could find a better personal pizza and at $6. Made fresh and given to you within about 5 minutes. Of course they have all other sizes of pizza too.

One request: please come to Brampton!"}
{"text":"WORST would be an understatement of their delivery service. I'm extremely upset. 

I ordered for a plain cheese thin crust pizza with wings and they told me to would be delivered in 40mins. 

2 Hours later, I haven't received my pizza. I decided to call them to find out what was going on, Only for them to tell me that \"They forgot and didn't know I wanted my delivery on time\" Can you imagine the bs they were saying? 

I DEFINITELY WOULD NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN! Too bad I won't have the opportunity to taste their pizza 

And what's worse is, they didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"Prices are high, but pizza is amazing! Had it a week ago and getting it again while I am in Canada! They now charge for dips instead of including them with each pizza, but the jalapeno ranch dip is so yummy, it is a must try! We love the fajita and get it every time we come to Canada!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza for little money. 
We've tried the Classic Pepperoni Pizza which was very nice.
Stuff was kind and funny. Best place to order for take away."}
{"text":"We ordered from Panago for the first time today after receiving their attractive flyers a couple of times before. Finally decided to try it as my husband and I have grown tired of our usual pizza delivery. 

The pizza arrived fresh and hot. We had a medium pizza (1/2 vegetarian and goat cheese and the other half is New York deli). It tasted really good. The dough had a good chew and crust. The ingredients tasted fresh. The goat cheese was creamy and delicious. 

We also ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings which was pretty good. No breading. But it had the right amount of salt and not too peppery. Not greasy. I would recommend not skipping the wings if you order pizza. 

Service delivery was quick and friendly. We would definitely order again. 

P.S. I love that it's Canadian-owned and made from 100% Canadian cheese."}
{"text":"I think I just met the Dog Whisperer's twin! He works at the Sarcee Trail Panago! Holy!

I had not ordered from Panago since a couple of years back when we lived in Ontario.
I always remembered it to be very good and a more expensive choice than other pizza chains. I however, am OK with paying a little extra for a good crust, decent cheese and fresh veggies.
The website on-line was extremely easy to use and I was able to navigate the menu and place my order for pick up.
I was a bit earlier than my self-designated pick up time but my pizza was just being freshly cut to be boxed. Ready to go! 
Friendly service!
I ordered a veggie-lite for me with thin multi-grain crust. It was lite alright! I ate the whole small as good as I got home. The veggie-lite has less toppings and less cheese so after not eating all day, I have 0% guilt! I tried the Hawaiian also - deeslish. Both are from the Frugal pricing menu which brings your single pizza cost down by a $1 or so. Value-wise I won't do that again. I will order the garden veggie that is loaded with several more toppings. I did love the lower-cal option though and for me, the cheese amount was just right so it is a toss up.
I would select this chain over Domino's and without question, over Pizza 73. But that is just me.
With how close this place is to our home, I have no doubt we will be back soon, and frequently.
Take out/delivery only."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but our order was wrong today. Likely not the fault of this Panago location but actually due to the company's online ordering system. I placed a re-order today and the pizza arrived with one of the toppings missing. I called the call centre number and they told me this happened because that one topping was no longer available so wasn't included on my pizza. I told the agent that the system didn't inform me of the deletion and I ended up with a pizza I didn't want. She told me there was nothing anyone could do for me because I ordered online and I was calling the call centre and that there was no one else I could talk to. To me, panago is panago call centre or website doesn't matter. They should take responsibility for the glitch in their system causing the error in my order."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say that this place is refreshing in many ways. This pizza is great: fresh ingredients, great tasting sauce and really good preset options. I usually go with the pepperoni classic for the meat, peppers and mushrooms combo.
The other great thing is the customer service.  When you call they are always pleasant on the phone (small company feel for sure) and also they randomly call you back to give you 5 dollars off your next order.  This has happened 3 times and I don't order that often. Definitely a nice touch.
Anyway, order here if you want reasonably priced, delishous pizza. 
Keep up the good work Panago!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza I found hair in it. I got credit for it. I ordered the credited pizza 2 weeks later . When I called to make the order the man took all the info and said it will be here in 40 min.  Well at the end after I waited for an hour I called and they said I never called . Terrible terrible service."}
{"text":"I like more thin greasy pizzas but Panago does deliver taste. We ordered small pizzas the other night for each of us and found them very tasty and filling. It's not my first choice for pizza but for delivery or take out, it's definitely a great option. It reminded me of a better Pizza Hut pizza."}
{"text":"I tried Panago for the first time a couple weeks ago when I bought pizza for my co-workers and I have to say it was a big hit. Normally we're pizza hut fans owing to the males in the group who mistake grease for flavour but this time around I'm glad we tried something different. The pizza at Panago is not ground breaking or uberly gourmet but for delivery/take out fare it's pretty tasty. Better than bland Pizza Pizza or grease soaked Pizza Hut. 

The pizza itself is remarkable in that it is not greasy or too doughy. Fresh ingredients and the sauce is decent and applied sufficiently. You also get a nice selection of dippers (ranch, cheese, hot sauce, tomato) with each small and above sized order. Prices are about the same as Pizza Hut.

It's also a BC chain too, gotta respect my roots you know!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza not to stingy with the toppings have endless options tons of choices. Sauce and crust are the highlights"}
{"text":"Yummy delicious pizza I ever ate. Very friendly staff.

They are ISNA Halal certified.  They prepare hahal pizza at separate station."}
{"text":"Panago has a great idea: Come or call in and order your pizza fresh, don't wait around 2 minutes for a slice to be heated up at Pizza Pizza et al. when you can come here and order an entire personal pizza fresh and only wait 6 minutes. 

This place runs like a well-oiled machine too, they are fast and everything is spotless."}
{"text":"Best gourmet pizza chain in all of Toronto.  A myriad of exotic pizza toppings highlight their menu from a taco-inspired pizza to a butter chicken pizza.  Pizza sizes vary from personal pan pizza to extra large pies that can be shared by a group.   Prices tend to be higher than other chains, but justifiably so as they offer great variety. Locations throughout the city are scarce with many locations commonly located throughout downtown.

Highly recommended for those seeking a change from Pizza Pizza, Gino's and other mainstream Canadian/Torontonian pizza chain brands."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Decent personal pizza for a great price. Base cost and then extra for each topping. I paid something like $7 for a small personal pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and mushrooms.
Had reasonable amount of toppings, fluffy crust and was made to order. We ate in house and watched people walk by. Was reasonably busy and I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Place is really clean and their pizza is made fresh to order. They have your pizza ready in less than 10 minutes which is awesome. My favourites are Grilled veggie + goat cheese- uber fresh and it's simply delicious and Philly steak- they don't cheap out on meat and caramelized onion adds just the right about of sweetness, yum"}
{"text":"DO NOT bother with this place. I tried here fore the first time today because I heard it wasn't bad and offered both Gluten Free and Vegan Cheese. First of all, I placed an order online for a future order time as my partner and I had people over. They did not offer delivery to our residence despite the fact we are only 10 minutes away... fine. So I scheduled for pick up because I had heard they are pretty good. I arrive for my scheduled pick up time and these people are going on that they did not receive the order and did not show much care to fix it. So I was tired and we had people over so I was just like okay... how long do I have to wait for a new one. They indicated 15 minutes.... I rolled my eyes, placed the order AGAIN and we waited.... 15 minutes later, no pizza ready..... ALL AND ALL this was an hour long ordeal from when I left to get the pizza and got home with said pizza - should have been no more than 20 minutes. It was getting late and I was hungry so I took a slice of pizza and honestly.... NOTHING remarkable. Their dip sucked, it wasn't really garlicky and just tasted very artificial. The pizza flavour and gluten free crust just tasted like wasted calories. Between the poor customer service, technology and food, I will not be ordering from here again. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"It was a disgusting experience. None of the staff wore gloves while working!

I haven't ever seen a food chain staff disregard hygiene, on pointing it out the unregretful employee said he had washed his hands!

Such a shame!"}
{"text":"You can feel the original dough and toppings with the nice temperature of panago serving. The cheese was good not too salty yet not tasteful like Swiss, there was a pineapple which I didn't expect for vegetables. 

They do have Halal process with assurance procedures on chicken pizzas only that separates the ovens, cooking ovens, knives which I don't see it's mandatory for Halal meat, it gives a clean and ambient feeling though. 

The price is amazing and one  comes with one can of pop for 4.245 $. I recommend it on the go for quick lunch or afternoon snack."}
{"text":"As the second Panago location to open in Toronto's downtown core, this pizza chain originally founded in British Columbia, offers a selection of gourmet pizzas. From personal to extra-large, and with a selection of traditional (e.g, pepperoni, vegetarian) and  ethnic flavors such as Veggie Korma, Butter Chicken, and Chipotle Chicken, the quality and taste of their product is superb.  The only negative thing that this location has going for them is the price for their pizzas which can surpass $19 for an extra-large pie (you can get an extra large pie at the Pizza Hut on Church Street for $10 as part of their online specials). I only wish that this chain offered more promotional coupons/coupon codes not only to save customers money,but also to help generate buzz."}
{"text":"I guess my expectations were a little high with all their fancy pants advertising. Thank the lord I had a coupon cause the pizza was pretty terrible...burnt, cardboard crust, gross sauce, it just wouldn't stop offending me so I had to stop eating it. I don't think my kids ate much either."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I think this place deserves another visit.  The place is new and they have a wide variety of pizzas (3 boards of menu).

We ordered a medium BBQ Chicken pizzas with multi-grain crust (they give you an option to choose regular crust or multi-grain crust - no extra charge).  The total came to about $16.50 so it's pretty decent!  They also prepare their pizza in front of you through a glass window.

Taste wise we'll be comparing them to Pizza Nova.  Their pizza was pretty good.  My wife don't usually eat the crust but Panagio's bread was very fluffy.  Ingredients were nice and not as wet as Pizza Nova's.  I do wished there was more tomatoes sauce.  The appearance of the pizza reminded me of Domino's Pizza but not as salty which is a plus for us.

Great price and great taste!  4 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"We order Panago Pizza online from time to time, and it's pretty good. We especially like the Prime Shrimp. Today we had the BBQ Steak pizza, and were not disappointed with that either. 
After your first purchase they will call you and give $5 off your next purchase. Not a big deal, but still a positive thing. So, if you are in a pizza mood, try theirs. It might not be the best in the world, but it's definitely better than most of the other chains."}
{"text":"I get pizza here almost ever Friday and without fail they are perfect. Friendly, clean and quick. Favourite of the takeout/delivery style pizza."}
{"text":"My coworker and I took a break from getting monitor tans in a data center during an overnight gig to grab a quick pie at Panago.  The place was empty because it was pretty late, but the young lady was friendly and happy to see us.  She immediately got to work on our pies, starting by cutting chunks of dough from a large bin, and proceeded to make the pizzas from scratch right in front of us.

I don't know if this is normal or not; most of the places where I get pizza do things behind walls, this was like Qdoba where they construct everything right there in the open.  I don't know if that made the pies tasted better but they were fantastic.  Piping hot, mouth-watering, and absolutely delicious.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"I was clamouring for a vegan pizza and wanted to try a new place. I decided on Panago Pizza which is just a short drive away from Kipling station.  Bear in mind, most of my vegan pizzas have been from Whole Foods, and vegan restaurants and I ordered a vegan pepperoni pizza from a place that does fast food pizza.  For some reason, I expected a high quality, thin crust pizza.  It wasn't what I got, but it was still much better than Pizza Pizza (well, so is cardboard with sauce, but I digress).  

Anyways, it was a thick crust and I think this would be a great pizza for a cheat day or in a drunken stupor, but I'm so used to thin crust and healthy food these days, this tasted boring to me and like a bunch of heavily processed ingredients put together.  

Despite this, would I recommend this place? Yes.  I think it's much better than most pizza chains and has a good variety of vegan options.

Verdict: Not my type of place, but if people want pizza and I have to go, I'll order something."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and delicious pizza. I recommend it for everyone. The prices are reasonable and the place is so clean."}
{"text":"Came here after the jays game. We won... 11-2;)  No places to sit....  Kinda a bummer. But I think it's meant to be taken out.  Hence the name. I got a small BBQ chicken pizza and the girlfriend got a personal pepperoni.  Freshly made. Took about 5-7 minutes. I loved mine. And she did too! . Good bang for your buck after a hot day at the ball park....  And right down the street."}
{"text":"I will preface to say there us no pizza like home (Montreal) though I really enjoyed the pizza here- it was delicious!!  The service was extremely friendly! Very clean place - they work to please - Bravo!! 
My friend didn't like his pizza he found it under done.  They offered to make him a new one and take the other one home to enjoy after he cooked it to his liking. This, is a great business - out to please!!"}
{"text":"I don't know much about authentic pizzas and whatnot but i do know if it tastes good without oil dripping off it and the bread doesn't taste weird or funky. It's good pizza to me. 

This place is the new king of delivery pizza. It's close by to me, delivery charge is literally 2.50 dollars, came to my place within 20 minutes, tons of variety pizzas, gluten free bread which they call gluten smart, no MSG, there dipping sauces are tasty too *try the jalape√±o ranch* and best of all I can order a medium pizza( 3 toppings) 2 dipping sauces and a can of pop including taxes and delivery = 20$ 

Try it out. For commercial pizza, I don't think you will find a better tasting pizza even if the prices were higher, I would still order from these guys, pizza is too good even the gluten smart veggie delite one I ordered last night, it tastes better then original italian bread they use in my opinion or any other leading pizza competition breads( dominoes, pizza pizza, pizza hut etc) I'm going to reheat some of my leftovers now after typing this review. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Try the honey garlic wings and thank me later. They are fire grilled and made with real honey and fresh garlic, and so delicious it's concerning. Hands down my favorite place to order wings from in the GTA. 

Their pizza is pretty bomb too, I haven't had a chance to try out all of their crust/sauce/cheese combinations (and most likely it will take a lifetime if I try!), but the multigrain thin crust takes the cake for me. I'm not usually a fan of the crust, but it just adds that special kick to make the pizza amazing. If you aren't into seeds in your pizza crust I would suggest NOT trying this one though! ;)

Also, they offer gluten free and vegan options and I forgot to mention that they use mostly (if not all) organic products and meats! Heck yeah!

The one bad experience I had is a delivery guy came to my place, buzzed in, left, went back to Panago, came back to my place, buzzed in again... and yes still with the same food. And he didn't give a reason why, so I'm still baffled. Had to call Panago to get new food since ours was cold now (I think the whole fiasco took around 2 hours), and they handled it super professionally and sent out new food straight away."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try their meatless pepperoni pizza. It was completely bland and tasteless and we had to add all kinds of spices to the pizza to make it edible.

Literally one of the worst pizzas of my life. Ate it because I was hungry but won't order from there again."}
{"text":"I love their \" Chipotle Chicken\", \" Veggie Korma\" and \" Steak Mushroom Melt\". The best part is that their service is so fast that anything takes less than 10 mins....!!!

They have got huge menu, 5 choices for the CRUSTS, almost 10 BASE SAUCES and plenty of choices for both meat lovers and veggie enthusiasts..!!!

DOUGH is made every day and stands for their tagline of FRESH PIZZA. And finally the customer service is so good that they remember their customers by name and their favourites."}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone would hate on panago - this place is BOMB.
Very accessible since it's right beside the aquarium & the ACC.
Lots of choices here too - for all my meat lovers, omnivores and herbivore plant-loving pizza eaters. The best thing is - there's vegan pizza here, yaasss! And you bet your butt I got myself a personal pizza. Although I do strongly believe in the verse that \"any pizza is a personal pizza if you believe in yourself\"

The pizza is thick, crispy and delicious. Vegan cheese was plentiful and the fake pepperoni also didn't taste super fake like most processed meat. It was 100% worth the crazy looks passerbys gave me as I ate this at union station by myself in business casual clothes at 12am.. by myself. WORTH EVERY BITE. & they have a lot of sauces for you to dip those crusts in! (if you don't eat crust, you are weak and natural selection will get you one day.)

Their other pizzas are also pretty unique and made with very fresh ingredients - their regular cheese pizza smells like HEAVEN. Ugh, so good. Prices are average too, especially for pizza in downtown.

Pizza and I are in a long-term relationship, please don't homewreck."}
{"text":"For quick take-out pizza, Panago got the job done. We were starving but feeling too lazy to go out to eat, so we opted to grab something nearby. We ordered online, picked up our pizza and were back home all within 15 mins. 

We didn't have high expectations, but surprisingly the pizza was great! It was a little doughy for my taste, but the crust was fresh, crisp and chewy. We chose to make our own pizza, but there are a bunch of premade options including a vegan pepperoni pizza!! Our pizza was NOT greasy at all and came loaded with our choice of vegan cheese and veggie toppings. Bonus points for having lots of vegan/vegetarian options, including Daiya brand cheese and flavored sauces/dips. Their website even specifies which ingredients and sauces contain animal products so you can feel confident in your choice.  

The staff here was courteous and made our pizza just the way we wanted it without a long wait. The store was clean and well maintained. Prices were reasonable, we paid about $24 for large pizza (10 slices) with multiple speciality toppings. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers.  This was my first time ordering from Panago and it won't be my last.  The order was the Steak and Mushroom Melt Thin Crust. I used the Yelp Check In and the business honoured the $5 discount. The official verdict on the pizza: Yummy. All pizzas take 4 1/2 minutes to cook. Super fast.  $13.56 all in for a Large pizza. Thank you Yelp for the discount."}
{"text":"OMG! I'm so shook to see this place with such less number of reviews. I recently went in store to try out Panago Pizza the very first time in downtown. I've tried before at a friend's place in Ajax and was curious to see if they have similar taste and service. 

Yes, it's a chain pizza store!! But not all locations taste the exact same. Anyway so we went in store as it's really not the taste same when delivered. I prefer hot and fresh. Also best way to avoid reheating it. 

This location has only 4-5 high chairs by the window. Extremely clean counter tops, flooring and even washrooms. The staff really made sure they cleaned everything they use to work on the pizza. Even the knifes and had gloves on whenever needed. The staff isn't very friendly but neither rude. They do their job BEST! That's all that matters.

Highly recommend the multigrain crust. Also they have dipping sauce available in Jars too. Each dipping sauce is 0.75 however the Jar is like $3 definitely worth it. Jalape√±o ranch and Italian Garlic are the two I've tried so far. I got one home and goes great with sweet potato fries, salad, sandwiches, chips or next time you order pizza. 

We got veg korma and primo vegetarian half n half. Make sure to try all the variety of seasonings and cayenne hot sauce they have."}
{"text":"Was ordering a pizza listing my topping I wanted not only did they get my order incorrect I was not able to finish adding toppings the guy taking the order said your pizza is already done. Like it was in the oven already. The the 7 after me received there food before me. To top it all off I was over charged"}
{"text":"I called to order food they wouldn't allow me to order with out the hotel phone number.  I didn't have the information in front of me I asked if I could order my food now and call back with it  that information. The lady became extra rude while she told me no and I just hung up. I'm going to eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"pizza in toronto is 99% disappointment. there are a few exceptions, and one is panago. they deliver, do take out, and have a small seating area in the shop. prices are more expensive than domino's or pizza pizza but not outrageous. 

let me interject here that i am a new yorker. i have spent nearly my entire life on the island of manhattan. panago would not be acceptable as food if i were home-- it would be considered very low-end, bland, and pretentious. BUT in toronto, it is the best that you will get. terroni up on yonge and st clair has better pizza, but you will pay for quality. panago is acceptable (exponentially better than any other canadian pizza chain) and the delivery option is a huge plus. 

try the buffalo chicken pizza, mm"}
{"text":"ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK! I've ordered from here twice now. 

The first time I submitted my order online and when I came to pick it up, they claimed never to have received any order, and I had to order again. The pizza also came with the smallest amount of cheese I'd ever seen on any pizza in my life. 

The second time, the pizza came with a tiny amount of cheese AGAIN (as if it was just sprinkled on like olives.. You could see all the other ingredients underneath) So I asked this time if I could get more cheese because I felt cheated. They insisted that this was a normal amount of cheese and that they couldn't possibly put more cheese on it now. 

So order at your own risk. I know that I personally won't be wasting my money here ever again..."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza, great selection, and great service - Bravo Panago! 

Oh not sure what the \"el cheapo\"
reviewer below is taking about being expensive?!?"}
{"text":"Just had a terrible costumer service experience with Panago. We ordered on the website - and payed $20 for what we thought would be a dairy-free pizza. We soon realized that the pizza had dairy-free cheese in addition to mozzarella (which apparently is the default option on the online ordering system and selecting dairy-free option doesn't override this default). When we realized this mistake we called customer service and were told that we made a mistake and nothing could be done about it. To add insult to injury, we were told that because we had ordered Panago in the past we should know better (despite the dairy-free pizza being for a guest and we had never ordered it before). Very disappointed in the response to our predicament - will not order from them again."}
{"text":"Before heading out to our Toronto FC match, my buddy and I decided to grab a bite. Across from the Metro plaza in Liberty Village is Panago, a pizza franchise that has a few locations in the GTA.
Upon entering the place is small, clean, and presentable with its open concept kitchen. 
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays they have a walk-in special Large pizza or cheese pizza for $10, or medium pizza for $8.  We opted for their medium since we were trying to maintain our beach body lol. 
Thankfully they had an option for thin crust and whole wheat, sticking to healthy options. Overall the pizza was good, at about a 3.5/5
Their prices are reasonable and they've got limited seating since this is a small location. Overall if you're in the area and are in need of some simple, quick pizza,nothing fancy, definitely come here."}
{"text":"Huge variety of flavours that all taste amazing. I've only tried about six so far since I've a tendency to stick with what I know sometimes. I do love the four different size options: personal 8', small 10', medium 12', and large 14'. For those with allergies, there are gluten-free and dairy-free options as well!

Versatility in salad options, including the ability to create your own salad the way you want it. 

Only problem with the pizza is that they're so good, I always have to add more walking/running to my day to work off the carbs! Haha"}
{"text":"I ordered the small Veggie Korma pizza one afternoon and was feeling skeptical about it while I was waiting. But it was absolutely delicious! The ingredients on the thin crust (you have your option of what kind of crust you prefer) were coconut curry sauce, roasted garlic, baby spinach leaves, green peppers, pineapple, hot banana peppers, mozzarella and cheddar.

The preparation (which you can see them make your pizza) and baking time was reasonable enough  for a small size right in the middle of the afternoon. I was out the door with my pie in approximately 20 minutes. The small was $12.75 plus tax and I was able to make two meals out of it. I was happy and will go back for the same or different pizza. So many kinds to choose from!"}
{"text":"It's not the best pizza you'll ever taste. I appreciate the great topping options, plus fresh dough. A pizza in under 10 minutes, the combo of this and rooster is great addition to boring area."}
{"text":"I've ordered from panago online a few times. They have quite a large selection (thin crust!). I've never had a bad experience with wait times etc. easy online order system. The pizza isn't amazing or all that special but it's good and decently priced. We ordered wings from here once, I didn't think they were all that great but my husband ate them all! lol"}
{"text":"If girl takes your order its good. If not it will get half made and you will be  there for 25 min listening to guys call each other names in Arabic about who's turn it is to make pizza boxes"}
{"text":"It's nice to see a new chain taking on Pizza Pizza, which has kind of dragged GTA pizza culture down to a pretty base level. This Panago is basically a take out outlet with a small window bar for seating and taking advantage of their $6 pizza/drink deal. The 8\" pizza is basically about the size of a double slice of Pizza Pizza/241/Pizzaville etc pizza. They don't sell pizza by the slice. And pretty much everyone that walked into this Panago while I was munching away asked exactly the same thing \"do you sell slices?\"

I didn't ask as it was obvious there were no slices on display.

What Panago does right: A good pie, many interesting varieties.

The 8\" personal size I did find too small. There's something nice about sliding a full sized slice into your mouth. I think the way to go with Panago is ordering a full sized pie.

This particular location is a stones throw from Skydome (Rogers Wireless Featuring Canada's Number One Data Network for Reliability Centre or whatever its been rebranded) and the convention centre (TD Canada Trust Convencatorium and No Loads Mutual Bunk Exhibition Hall). It's clean and pleasantly staffed. Oddly there was no trash can for your food if you ate in."}
{"text":"Normally I love Panagos but this is the first time I ordered from this location and it was really shitty. You don't spend 23 dollars on a philly cheese steak pizza for it to be dry, with barely any steak or toppings on it. 

I was really disappointed. Normally I order from a different location which is superb but I think this location needs to fix the quality."}
{"text":"Panago Pizza is one of our regular pizza places on a Friday night when we just don't feel like cooking. It's down the street from us so it's really easy to get to.

Food: We usually pick up one walk in special of pepperoni and one other one. I actually really like the pepperoni special because there is always a decent amount of toppings and the crust isn't too thin or too thick. It's a great value! I've also ordered the pesto chicken and while it was good, I found it to be a little too strong in flavour. I prefer the simpler taste of meat and cheese. The dipping sauce is worth getting too! I usually get anything with garlic.

Service: Always good! Everyone is nice and never rude. Despite it being busy, I don't think they take that long. In order to prevent waiting, I would call ahead. The waiting area isn't too big and sometimes can get full. 

Overall experience: We really enjoy the pizza here. Sometimes it's a little pricier than other chains but the food that we get is always pretty good and the location for us is great and can't be beat. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! The best pizza place I found, but they are a bit pricey. They have a wide variety of pizzas, which is good. I tried many flavours and they are all amazing. I love that they also have very delicious dipping sauces. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Always order from this location! Pizza is ALWAYS amazing and quick delivery:) would definately recommend!

Ps. They have halal options for those of you who cant eat nonhalal.  Amazing:)"}
{"text":"Panago was the worst choice we could have made.  I couldn't even tell you what the pizza tasted like because we never actually got it.  

We decided to order from the new Panago in Barrhaven and placed an order that was said to take 35min.  3 calls to the dispatch and 1hr 15min later we still did not receive our pizza.  After talking to 3 personnel and stating how late the pizza was, not one person suggested that we keep the pizza if and when it arrives, BUT instead said that if the pizza did arrive to send the delivery back and they would credit my account with the cost of the pizza.  Not sure how that makes any sense since I clearly stated that we would never be ordering from there again.  This place 100% does not care about customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing pizza the other day. My girlfriend and I got a coupon for any two medium size pizzas for $20.00. When we got there, we were presented with a variety of choices and selections to pick from. After we ordered we had to wait about 15 mins. The only issue we had was that the cashier got on of our pizza order slightly wrong. We wanted a thin crust with multi grain but we got the normal and white crust. 

There are no seating area in this location and you would need to pay $1 for parking. We would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I used to spread my pizza orders around: Dominos, Pizza Pizza, Stoney's, Fantastico. That has changed. Now every Friday I get my pizza here.  They have an impressive array of specialty pizzas with topping combinations unlike any pizza place I have before. Amazing sauces and I'm not just talking tomato sauce (which by the way tastes real and pure here and not like sugar and preservatives) but also a white jalape√±o sauce, a cheese sauce, hot sauce, salsa, and many more. And the toppings! I have never had a pizza before where I've saluted the mushrooms. Every topping here tastes delicious and real, not like some other places that taste like all their toppings come out of a can and sit in water all day. 

Honestly, I cannot say enough about this place. Friendly staff. Pizzas are ready quick! Even the call centre for orders has friendly people. 

Favourite pizzas: Buffalo Chicken, True Canadian, Super Cheesey Meatball (which I swap to being chicken instead of meatballs) and Philly Steak. I also like the Mediterranean Salad."}
{"text":"There are plenty of pizza joints along this Avenue Rd. strip so there's plenty of competition. My intention was to go to one of the other places to pick up dinner but this place had always been on my radar.

If you are looking for slices this isn't the place to go but they make up for it in their wide variety of options. For the basics (pepperoni or cheese), there's a walk in special that can get you a decent size pizza for $4-$8 (depending on the size) so I picked up one of those. However, then I started purusing the menu that was on the wall. You can tell they play around with ingredients to find interesting combinations. I decided to pick up a chicken taco pizza as well because it just sounded different.

Both pizzas had lots of toppings and for those who hate when pizza restaurants are skimpy on the cheese, you don't have to worry. The crust was a little thicker than I like it, but had a sweet flavor to it that really blended well with the pizza toppings. The chicken taco pizza was covered in fresh shredded lettuce and tomato, and surprisingly tasted like a chicken taco. The only downside to that pizza was that the traditional crust dipping sauces don't go with it.
 
The pepperoni pizza on the other hand had plenty of meat, cheese and sauce. Really nothing bad to say about it. And that pizza DID pair very well with the crust dipping sauces. 

All in all a nice, comparable pizza option in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It is good when it is fresh, tastes bad the next day.
They can be very skimpy on the ingredients, but it still beats pizza pizza any time.
Overpriced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Oh Panago it's been too long!

Panago and I go way back. Like so far back I used to get pizza's from this chain in Calgary when they were still called Panagopolous. I've always wondered why they shortened the name. At first I thought that maybe when they expanded into Ontario they weren't sure that Ontarians would be able to handle big words like Panagopolous, but it wasn't until several years after their rebrand that they entered the Ontario market. I guess we can chalk it up to the trend in the late 90's to shorten business names.

Back in November at the October challenge wrap-up party Vivek gave us all a coupon for a free personal pizza for this location. I exercised my use of the coupon today to get my favourite pie, the BBQ chicken. This location did not disappoint. The pizza came loaded with toppings and was just the way I remembered it. Tangy BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, red pepper, and juicy chunks of chicken all held together by a solid layer of cheese.

If you've never had Panago you're missing out. For a chain restaurant, this is the number one joint on my pizza list."}
{"text":"Good delivery guy. Terrible pizza. Room temperature and very restricted toppings. It was so bad, we actually emailed customer service. Much better alternatives that deliver in the area.

As a follow up, customer service dealt with our complaint including a credit to our account in less than 24 hours. That is important and impressive. Not sure if it will make the pizza better but at least they are accountable to customers."}
{"text":"Ah good old reliable Panagopoulos (at least that was your name) -- you held the distinction for being the best pizza chain in the GVRD (until Uncle Fatih's started expanding).  I have probably eaten an ungodly amount of Panago in my years - I don't know how many Goldeneye/Counter-Strike gaming nights they've 'catered'.  In addition, my old company used to treat everyone to free pizza bi-weekly.  Thankfully, they switched over to Panago after everyone was complaining about the free Freshslice (another GVRD pizza chain opening here -- stay the fuck away, it's barely edible -- it's like eating a circle of hot garbage).

Solid fresh toppings and most of their pizzas choices seem to be created with some care to the final taste, rather than just haphazardly changing 2 or 3 toppings on the same old tomato sauce.  So you can grab butter/chipotle/buffalo chicken sauce or even coconut curry sauce.  Despite the funky flavours, it's more your traditional pizza joint - you order your pie for pick-up or delivery - there are no heat lamped slices here.

Glad that there's a Panago so close to my place.  However, it's still not Uncle Fatih's - which I have drunkenly compared to receiving fellatio from a deity (dat sesame crust).  But Panago is damned solid for a pizza chain."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty decent for Ontario's style of pizza.   Panago does a nice melted cheese and a good tomato sauce base.

What's amazing about this place is how fast it delivers, particurly after 8-9pm on a Sunday night.  Delivers often within less 25 mins of the order if you live within 2km of the location.  Fastest pizza delivery in Toronto I know."}
{"text":"They offer HALAL at this location!

Tasty pizza, but it's a bit on the pricey side. I'd like more halal options to be available, but hey, at least they have some! 

I believe a family is running this location, and I've had a pleasant and welcoming experience every time I've come. 

Check out Panago if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"By far the worst pizza I've ever eaten. Tastes similar to soggy cardboard. The only vegetable on this vegetable pizza is some sloppy moist overcooked tomato. Wait - is this a pepper? I don't know. I can't tell. There is also pineapple on it, which I think is a fruit. This fruit pizza was also delivered 30 minutes later than the estimated time. I only ate a few disgusting slices and my stomach hurts. Never again."}
{"text":"first things first: the map marker is wrong! take a look at their website, they're on another block!

=============================

my second pizza in toronto. the first one was bought by another guy, so i had no control over it and it tasted kind of like something i'd expect from a frozen one from the grocery store. not too bad but definitely not worth the money.

so i figured i'd give something that comes highly recommended by members on yelp. but once again: frozen food. at least that what it tastes like to me.
at least the jalapeno peppers were really damn hot though. more than i expected but hey - at least in that respect, i got what i asked for.

maybe i'm spoiled by the real italian stoneoven pizzerias but this is just nonsense in my opinion and not worth the price."}
{"text":"I go here about once a month and is always pretty solid. Ordering from the mobile app is simple and quick. The food itself is the usual fast food pizza; nothing spectacular but when you are too tired to cook, it's decent. 

The staff at the store are indifferent and usually make you wait at least 2-3 minutes before coming to the counter to help you despite making eye contact when you walk in. I suppose the staff need to finish their conversations with each other first! Don't expect any basic manners from the staff."}
{"text":"Fresh dough and very clean environment. I had the chicken club personal and it was good. Would highly recommend if you're in the area or if you want better pizza than the other greasy options out there."}
{"text":"This place is right down from the CN Tower, and a great stop if you want some food before going on the Steam Whistle brewery tour.

The sell by the whole pizza, and even have dipping sauces if you like ranch and the likes with your pizza. And for decent prices too! The major downfall though, is there's a whole 5-10 seats in the whole place. Its more of a carryout, or go sit out on the bench on the sidewalk and enjoy it on a nice day, kinda place. But the pizza itself is really good! just the right amount of everything. And the ranch goes great with the crust! It's pretty quick and fresh when you order it too. If you're in the area, and don't want to go to the nice fancy sit down places in the area, this is a great stop in place."}
{"text":"Fabulous regular and gluten-free pizza and our favorite takeout pizza in the city."}
{"text":"This pizza is hideous.  The customer service is worse. I ordered a pesto pizza. It was grainy and bitter. I ended up having to throw it out uneaten because it was just unfortunate. To make matters worse while I stood in this tiny location trying to decide the guy behind the counter stood starring impatiently,  sighing until I ordered something.  Whole foods is next door, much better pizza for about the same price. Just don't do it."}
{"text":"The cleanest pizza ever! The owner is very nice guy and kind ! I recommend everyone to visit them"}
{"text":"This is based on my single visit to this Panago pizza location. Rude customer service. Cashiers do not like to be asked questions about the menu. The cashier started cooking without washing their hands. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, maybe even a 4 considering this is the best bbq chicken I've ever laid my eyes on.  Back home, when I used to eat more of this before Yelp got me into trouble with these neopolitan pizzas, but I'll digress, I would alternate between this and Philly Steak, because that's their 2 best flavours.

Ordered delivery to my hotel, and really, delivery was exactly as girl on the phone said: 35 minutes.  Really cool that they still have your ordering history from last year.

But delivery man couldn't make AMEX work on his card so just use your visa/mc.

What I loved tonite was the evenly spread of the ingredients, not to mention a generous amount too.   Plus not too heavy on the bbq sauce, just right."}
{"text":"I discovered Panago Pizza this year and have never looked back. The combination of crust, sauce and cheese is exactly how I like it. The only improvement would be a higher sauce ratio. The True Canadian is really good, but I usually just get the carry-out special, either pepperoni or just cheese. 

There are bar-style tables with tall chairs around the edge of the room where you can sit while waiting or eat if you're in a rush. The tables are always clean and I've never had to stand while waiting. 

I've always had a positive experience at this location. My first time I spent a lot of time looking at the options and the staff were really friendly and offered lots of advice on which were the best/most popular pizzas. They make the pizzas really quickly and bring it around the counter directly to where you are waiting which is a nice touch that I really appreciate."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

I've heard a lot about Panago Pizza from my relatives who live in downtown, particularly in saying how it's probably the best budget chain pizza in the GTA (better than Pizza Hut). I decided to order take-out from this branch earlier today, just before grabbing the GO train home.

I ordered two personal-size pizzas: Philly steak and primo vegetarian. One thing I definitely liked was that despite the train delay this afternoon and me getting home 30 minutes later than usual, the pizza was still relatively warm. I only had to heat it for about 30 seconds and it was ready to eat.

As for the two pizzas, I liked the philly steak one a lot more than the primo vegetarian. The mushrooms, green peppers, and carmelized onions were very good, and the steak was actually chewy and not tough. As for the primo vegetarian pizza, the sauce and red peppers were very good, but the spinach came already burnt and crispy, as well as a couple of the fire roasted tomatoes. Needless to say that in alone lost the 4 stars I would've given if I simply ordered the philly steak pizza.

Service was very good, and the employees definitely gave you time and explained the different sizes of the pizza and what each pizza consists of for you.

I'll come back if I wanna have a budget take-out pizza, but for gourmet style dine-in pizza there's better options out there."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas and some salads last week, came up to $50+.

The pizzas were a bit meh, they have nicer recipe combos compared to other chains, but I found it a bit lacking in cheese, the crust also felt a bit dry. Overall it just tasted ok, it's definitely not worth the premium you pay for this place.

 I had eaten Panago one other time downtown near Rogers Centre and they seemed to have a far superior quality of pizza compared to this location.

The salads were pretty good, but the \"grilled\" chicken on the salads don't look very grilled to me, it looks more like they were pulled out of a steamer."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza as it's conveniently below my building. They occasionally call me and provide a $5 credit on future orders.

I prefer their pizza over other chains as it tastes more real. My orders are always ready by the time I come down to pick it up. My favourite is their Canadian pizza."}
{"text":"Horrible! I wasn't aware of the pick-up deal on Wednesday's where the price of a large is the same as the small size pizza. I ordered a small not knowing. The guy working there didn't even mention the special to me! A random stranger did but by then it was too late. There are way too many pizza places to come back here again. Not worth coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and excellent quality with all fresh toppings. All organic stuff used in the pizzas."}
{"text":"Good quality food. The customer service is great. I tried it once and iam hooked to this place."}
{"text":"Best chain pizza I've had in a while, miles and miles beyond Pizza Pizza or Pizzaville. Slightly pricier at $12-20 for a 14\" pie but well worth it -- it's a thick pie with lots of toppings, so we won't be hungry. Phone staff were helpful, delivery charge was only $2.50, and delivery was speedy.  Couldn't decide between Primo Pollo (grilled chicken with basil and veggies) or Butter Chicken. Eventually went with the Primo. Thick, soft crust and fresh ingredients. Definitely getting this again.

EDIT 4/2012: went back for the butter chicken pie. That was... interesting and addicting. The sauce is tomato-soupy and mildly-spicy and the chicken is plentiful."}
{"text":"I had figured Panago to be a run-of-the-mill pizza chain, but it delivered much more than I had expected.   

It offers a very extensive variety of crusts, sauces, cheeses, veggies, and meats, and the menu contains a large number of creative topping combinations.  Preparation is quick, the pizzas are delicious, and the pricing is great (under $6 for my regular order - an 8\" with four toppings, including two premium ones)."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite is the tropical Hawaiian pizza and the wings! Absolutely do get the orange and mango juice and it's only $3!"}
{"text":"Passata sauce, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, green olives, grilled chicken, extra mozzarella. If stranded on a desert island with my future family, I would trade my first born son for this pizza."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their lunch special for the $5 flat personal size pizza with a drink, organic and heathy options available. I stop here on most days during lunch at work, I'd only ask they listen more decisively when noting your name for an order. I spelt my name for the order taker, and it was not only wrong, but not even close."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good, good quality and friendly staff. No place to sit it's really just a come in grab your pizza and go. 

Recently they called me and gave me a $5.00 on my credit for no reason. 

thumbs up for that customer service"}
{"text":"It's the first time I've ever heard a business refuse service because \"they don't deliver in that area!\" What good is a delivery service when you can't even deliver within a 5 km radius?!

Oh well..guess I'm taking my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints and consistently offers a wide variety of only the best ingredients and toppings. If you seek organic Italian tomato sauce, meats raised without use of antibiotics, or even halal/gluten free options, highly recommend Panago to satisfy your pizza cravings.

Also, loving the #sharemorecanada summer pizza boxes designed by Toronto born illustrator @chairman_ting to celebrate #canada150 !

{"text":"I used to order from Pizza Nova , Pizza Pizza, but when I tried pizza from Panago, it changed my opinion and enhanced my taste. I love all kinds of pizza and their dipping sauces. 

Along with the pizza I always order the garlic bread which is heavenly and  fresh.

We usually place the order through their web site which gives us the variety of options for the vegetables and meats plus dipping sauces. They are slightly pricey than other chains but trust me, its worth it. Cheers."}
{"text":"Panago is my go to pizza pick up or delivery. The quality is always great. Pizzas are made on demand. I always get the Italian thin crust. The pizzas are very good for your average franchise pizzeria. I usual get the chicken chipotle or the pesto chicken, no dipping sauce required, pizzas are yummy on their own. Great for a midweek order."}
{"text":"Worst pizza and wings I've ever ordered! 
Especially the pizza I could not eat it and first time I've stopped myself from eating it. Just tastes awful with poor quality Ingredients (chicken/ham)."}
{"text":"Really love this place! Pizza is fresh and well made. I love the people who work there - mostly HS students that are super friendly, genuine and helpful :) Recommend the Chipotle Chicken (OUT OF THIS WORLD), Primo Capicollo and the Taco pizzas! Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I first tried a slice of Panago's Hawaiian pizza during a promotion at the LCBO, and it was ooey-gooey good. Unfortunately, my order-in experience didn't live up to that impression. The pizzas are creative, and the prices competitive, but the pies are simply mediocre. The crust was especially disappointing. It's too bad as I really wanted to like this place.

The delivery man initially went to the wrong address so it was a bit later and colder than promised, but this is hopefully not a regular occurrence!

Would I grab a quick slice if I happened to be in Liberty Village? Maybe. But I'm going to stick to Dominos for delivery."}
{"text":"Our go-to delivery pizza place, haha. It's not fancy, and the pies aren't the best bang for your buck, but they are cheaper and delicious, and the ingredients are fresh! Panago promises on no msg or additives in their sauces, and their shrimp is ocean wise, so bravo on those two facts alone!!! A total step above pizza pizza and dominoes, in my opinion. You can also customize your crust! Primo vegetarian and BBQ chicken are our favourites. We ordered it two days ago, and I am craving them again!"}
{"text":"The only thing I miss about my time living in NYC is the pizza. I was very stuck up about it when I moved back to Toronto, sure that no one would make a decent enough one here. i stand corrected, this place crafted a very good one, and has a feel like it's a upscale version of Dominos in the sense it came quickly but that is where the similarities end. I ordered a bbq sauce pepperoni pizza with mozzarella / cheddar blend and it was well balanced, cooked perfectly and not heavy tasting."}
{"text":"Oh thank god there is a decent pizza place. I thought Canadians cannot make pizza after one experience. Decent price and a very good portion. They haven't tried too hard. Just a yeast dough with good collection of toppings. They have a huge collection that suits everyone's taste buds. This would be the ideal place to order for a movie night."}
{"text":"Customer service and efficiency needs work at this location. Ordered pickup online for a later time, got there slightly early but still had to wait almost 10 minutes past my pickup time and I only ordered 1 pizza. The staff didn't seem too interested either. We normally like Panago pizza and this is the most convenient location now so might have to try another pizza place."}
{"text":"Always have great pizza. Quick and fresh. I only ever pick up as the delivery times can be long and paying tips on pizza to me isn't worth it. I would always recommend."}
{"text":"This is definitely the \"go to place\" for pizzas! Not only are the staff friendly and helpful but the pizzas are amazing! Their Chipotle Chicken Pizza is definitely something I would recommend.
Did I also mention their wings and cheese bread are out of this world? 

Food quality is definitely a 5 stars. Everything is fresh and the taste is amazing!

Overall, I would definitely be going to this place a lot."}
{"text":"Whoo Hoo! First to review the Eglinton location. It's nice to see this franchise uptown and near work! Mmm. 

VIBE 
I like this one because there are about 8 - 10 seats as opposed to about five at the Gerrard location. Panago always looks sleek and modern. I'm sure you could lick the counter and it would taste good. That's how clean it is here. The service is friendly but the girl at the counter could have known how much a pop was -- she looked it up though. 

I ATE
Panago is having a great special on right now. From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., pizzas and salads are $5, taxes in. Love it. Easy peasy. 
This is my favourite fast food pizza in the city. Nice thin crust with a bit of crisp and fresh ingredients. Always hot out of the oven. Mmmm. Their garlic sauce is quite delectable as well. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Go go go to Panago!"}
{"text":"So it's Saturday evening and I am about to get a 1 hour massage at the plaza at Derry & Financial drive starting at 4:45pm. I am a little peckish and know that I will be hungry for dinner after. What is a girl to do? I see the Panago in the same plaza so I pull out my phone and very quickly order a small Hawaiian pizza ($10 plus tax) to be picked up at precisely 5:55pm. Easy and quick! I walk over to Panago after my awesome massage and voila! My hot pizza is ready for me to take home. Delicious and very convenient. I was even able to create an account so that next time I order it will be even easier (remembers previous orders). Well done Panago!"}
{"text":"The pizza is often good, when they get your order right. But the service is lacking. This is a take-out for me. I'm at the point where I need to stop using them. Orders are typically late which equals cold pizza and toppings you pay for are often missed."}
{"text":"We have bought the halal or vegetarian pizza mostly. Got $2 off twice. All my sister does is order on the phone and we pick it on the way home. I love the butter chicken, garden veggie, veggie korma .. The portion size is pretty good. Service is good. People working their are nice. I was amazed when I saw a man with burnt arms last time when I visited. That would be the only reason of me not buying pizza..Hope Panago's management understands and takes it seriously. Obviously, I would not like to see anyone be burnt that much for my pizza!:((("}
{"text":"very nice fresh pizza.. on the expensive side, but it's delicious and the service is awesome-the dudes here seem really cool"}
{"text":"One of the better pizza joints in this area. The ingredients are fresh and flavourful, and you definitely get good value for your money. I have ordered take out here several times in the past year and a half, and have always been happy with my 'pies'
For me this was gourmet pizza without the gourmet price. if you live in this area definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"I had great experiences at another Panago and decided this would be a good choice for an office lunch. I ordered up 6 pizzas with such ease. When I arrived, they were just coming out of the oven and they smelled so good. All 6 pizzas were done perfectly as ordered and they were filled with toppings. Everyone at the office loved it. There was not a single slice left. Lots of chicken and meat on the meat pizzas. The veggie pizzas all had the right amount of veggie variety and were fresh (not from a can!). The prices were just right as well. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had a medium new york deli pizza one sunday afternoon.   Honestly it was one of the best pizzas Ive ever had.   Cost $16.75 (tax in).. So it wasnt that cheap on a walk in.   But it was really good."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something outside the box and this pizza place did not dissapoint.  I'm a fan.  Will be back someday."}
{"text":"this is a neat little shop. came by during my lunch break at work and ordered a personal size pizza.
got the steak and mushroom melt. and it was $5 something plus taxes.
they have a large selection of toppings so it took me a while to decide.
they stay pretty true to what it is you're ordering. meaning the steak and mushroom melt pizza didn't even come with the tomato base. it took me an entire slice to notice what it was. personally i like having the tomato base on all of my pizzas so it's just weird without it to me. but it was still good. i'd definitely go back and try some of the other pizzas."}
{"text":"The pizza here at Panago is fresh and affordable, but it's not that great.

My friend and I had our dinner here last night.
I ordered:

 - Shrimp Club 8\" personal pizza ($5).  Its ingredients were: wild pink shrimp, bacon, tomato, purple onions, tomato, & mozzarella.
 - Chicken Wings, Tikka Masala flavour ($6).

The pizza had decent ingredients, but I wasn't a fan of the crust.  It tasted like that of a fast food pizza chain's crust.  The wings, however, were good.  If I return, I'll just stick with the wings.  The Indian tikka masala flavour was interesting, but it didn't taste too similar to a tikka masala dish.

On most days, Panaga is open until 11pm, so it's an option for a late weekday bite.  It's way better than Big Slice, I'll admit."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff.  It's the closest Pizza joint so we tried it for the first time.  Pizza was OK.  Dough was a bit on the dry side but other than that it was decent pizza.  Pizza takes 10-15 minutes upon ordering."}
{"text":"I have been waiting 1.5 hours for pizza and the delivery guy called to say he is running late. Almost 2 hours for 1 medium pizza, ya I think this will be the last order"}
{"text":"Everything annoys me about this place. If the food was good I'd probably overlook it but the pizza is not good and it's expensive. 

I called in my order and it took longer to talk to the person on the phone than cook the pizza. I suspect they pool there stores into one pizza hotline:

What's your phone number
What's your first name
whats your family name
pick-up or delivery
where are you calling from 
what location would you like to pick up from
what size pizza
flat bread, hand tossed or white
what toppings would you like
any crushed pepper
any graded cheese 
any sauces or dips

Holley crap I'm not hungry any more! 

When I picked up the pizza the \"large\" was about the size of a large dinner plate. I asked for crushed red pepper on the side and they charged me for it... what kind of pizza place charges for condiments? As for the actual pizza, I didn't like the crust or the sauce."}
{"text":"I will be completely honest - this is some of my favourite pizza. The menu is very versatile and original. There is something for every taste. We've ordered here on numerous occasions and are yet to be disappointed. The pizza is always cooked to perfection and crispy but not burnt. The only part that makes them lose a star is the price point. It is on the pricier side. (Small is approx the cost of a large at  other places)."}
{"text":"Will not be returning to this location, the main guy there displayed poor customer service. We placed an order online for pick up which was quick, however when we got the pizza home, it was the wrong one. No worries, we drove back right away and the guy working actually argued that it was the right one even though the receipt showed all the \"build your own\" ingredients we had chosen. He then said 'Well we're closed.... Do you want me to make another one?\" which we did and waited 20 minutes for it, there was no apology the entire time or offer to comp a free item for the inconvenience. In the meantime, the woman working and him discussed about how the mistake happened. They realized that their delivery driver took the incorrect pizza out to another customer. The woman said that they'd probably be upset too and he just said \"Whatever, we're closed. We'll just hear about it tomorrow.\""}
{"text":"Great food. Horrible delivery. How hard is it to check an order before it goes out? And when you call to ask for the order to be corrected, they really aren't helpful. It's their customer service that has me switching back to my last pizza joint for delivery."}
{"text":"Generally the only thing I get from Panago is their BBQ Chicken pizza because I like it so much.  BBQ sauce, chicken, carmelized onions, and red pepper. YUM!  Their cheddar dip is also the best IMO for dipping your crust into.

I'm sad that there aren't as many locations here as there are out west but at least this location is close enough to my house that they'll deliver."}
{"text":"I've written off Panago Pizza, and here's why. 

While Panago's offers more creative pizza choices than the loved-or-hated Pizza Pizza, this chain, and especially this location is 

Not generous with toppings. 
Slightly overpriced especially given competition 
Not fresh in taste
Surprisingly bland given the interesting combinations they offer.

This Panago Pizza is quick on delivery though, at least at this location. AFter a long move-in-day, they were the quick call. But I doubt I'll dial that number again and given your options in the area, you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I love Panago as far as the pizza and variety are concerned - however their call centre number constantly says the number isn't in service - I still haven't gotten an answer why but the last 3 months calling was pointless as the number was out and I went into the store and showed the manager and staff and they said others had been having the same issue - the ODD time it would work but I can't see that being helpful for the delivery aspect of business. Nothing was done about it."}
{"text":"Panago   is conveniently located near Square One  in the Parkside Area.  I like it because gives us variety since we have PizzaNova a block away and Pizza Pizza  nearby . I have tried their  Panago Classic and their vegetarian and  I like the softness of the dough and the richness of the toppings. Do give this a try sometime . You will like it .  Its really useful when you forget to prepare a meal or  am not in the mood for preparing lunch or dinner  ."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest looking places in the neighbourhood with some very freindly staff (a couple aren't but most are very, very nice). I've only ever had personal pizzas so I can't speak of a full sized one, but the personal pizzas taste great and are a very good deal for ~$6, and I think there's a lunch special of a personal + a drink for $6.50 including tax. 
So far, I'd recommend the Philly Cheese Steak the most (the steak is very soft although I suspect its fairly processed)."}
{"text":"Good fast meal, a more elegant form of pizza i would say. Their butter chicken pizza has an interesting flavour and aroma. I found it to be tasty but very heavy. Overall good satisfactory service for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Great pizza, especially that they have multi-grain pizza crust!  

Try their Tikka Masala chicken wings - Yum!

Very quick pizza for pick-up; eventhough they tell you to come pick it up in 20 mins, go in 10 mins.  It will be ready."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service! This was our first time ordering pizza from here and for sure we will again. We ordered the shrimp pesto thin crust and it was sooooooo yummy!! We also had a small Cesar salad. Both were great!! The employees were very friendly. We ordered online and the process was really simple as well. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This one-star review is not based on the pizza - the pizza is great - but on the poor customer service I have received in particular by the younger staff of Panago. 

My last visit to Panago was very frustrating. I came in to pick up two pizzas after ordering them over the phone. Simple enough - call in and pick up the pizza after 15 minutes. Wrong! After 20 minutes I had come in to pick up my pizzas. A girl working the counter asked if I came in for a pick up and I answered yes and told her I was waiting for 2 large pizzas. With no response I assumed she was in the process of making my pizza as she continued kneading some pizza dough. So I waited 10 additional minutes in hopes of getting my pizza. Frustrated, I attempted to get the girl's attention, but, of course, she continued to ignore me even though she could see that I was trying to get her attention. Finally, she brought 2 pizzas that were sitting on the shelf in the back right up to the counter. It was my order, which had been sitting there all this time! What the hell am I going to do with 2 cold pizzas? This girl could care less about providing a decent level of service to her customers. Next time, check the orders in the back when someone comes into pick up a pizza instead of ignoring them and doing things at your own leisure. 

The Pizza Pizza across the street might have a far inferior product, but their customer service is 100 times better than this place. Sad thing is, this is the second time this has happened to me. 

If you want to deal with self-absorbed teens who don't do their jobs properly, then go to Panago where the pizza is decent, but their customer service will drive you to Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"We checked out there before Maroon 5 concert. The food is great and the price is well deserved. But I remember the front desk guy was even too lazy to talk to us. The chef also noticed that and he instead talked to us. I really cannot have a 4-star rating to a restaurant while the cashier is not even talking to his customers.

Sorry chef, and sorry the nice food."}
{"text":"So we got a couple of weeks back  a coupon for a free pizza addressed to us in the mail. Today it seemed like a fitting day to use the coupon because I had to work a double. So I got my wife a medium Pizza for pick up and they said it would be ready in 15min. 

First impression when I walked in here!! Wow one of the cleanest pizza places I have ever seen in my life. I think you could have open heart surgery on their counters.

Very friendly and enthusiastic gentlemen behind the counter ( might have even been the owner ). Then there was a lady in front of me with those pizza bags ( usually for delivery ) and I thought that it was the delivery driver, but when it was my turn he actually gave me my pizza in one of those bags to keep ( It says they are a $1.- in the menu ). 

I ordered the Grilled Veggie + Goat Cheese Medium Pizza ( regular $13.25.- ), the crust was just out of this world. I haven't eaten such a good crust in a long time. It was soft but at the same time crunchy. It is hard to describe. On their website they claim that the dough is made on a daily basis in each store and contains no additives, well it sure tasted that way!! 

They have 39 different pizza recipes of their own on the menu. They offer regular, thin and multigrain crusts, nine sauces, five cheeses and thirty-three toppings. If you want to make your own Pizza the prices are divided into Crust ( S $8.75.-, M $10.25.-, L $12.50 ); Toppings ( Regular S $0.50; M $0.75.-; L $1.00.- and the Primo Toppings count as 2 regular toppings and those are fancier toppings like Wild Pink Shrimp, Kalamata Olives, Smoked Oyster etc. ). 

They also have salads, breadsticks, four types of wings and dips & shakers.

I can't wait to go back and actually order my kind of pizza which is more a meat lovers pizza..."}
{"text":"I scroll Uber Eats looking for pizza a little too often. I've had the pleasure of working with Panago before so I know they're sweet, and boom! They were 20 minutes delivery time to my door. Let's go! 

I had a caesar calad, cajun hot wings and a Brooklyn-style pepperoni pizza. Their pizza is always decent and delicious, but the stars of the shows were the juicy wings. I didn't see that one coming. Panago is officially in my delivery rotation."}
{"text":"I've tried several of their pizzas, not bad overall, nothing extraordinary, fresh ingredients. They get too busy on Fridays, forget my wings. Will give you a coupon for the next time."}
{"text":"I went to another Mississauga location earlier this week and it is night and day. I ordered another New York Deli. Granted the Pizza is pricey for what you get but I could at least see toppings (a lot more) compared to this location and tasted better. I knew I wasn't crazy thinking the actual owners are very skimpy on toppings and it has gone downhill compared to 2015.

Avoid this location unless you want a cheese pizza with scraps of toppings."}
{"text":"So you love pizza? You don't even know what love is until you eat the pizza HERE! Amazing toppings and ideas for every dietary need. I always feel slightly less guilty for getting pizza here!"}
{"text":"Overdue review. Remember when we went kayaking? Was it even kayaking? Then we cycled around Harbourfront. Were they two different events?? Well I clearly don't remember, but I remembered THE PIZZA.

It was fatty pizzas after baking in the sun and cycling for an hour and a half. And walking for two more hours. We ordered 3 pizza's for our 6 people cycling team. The pizzas were so good!!!!! Panago has a huge list of pizzas plus you can customize. It's a little pricier than other pizza chains, but they have a LOT of more delicious options. Well worth it!!!"}
