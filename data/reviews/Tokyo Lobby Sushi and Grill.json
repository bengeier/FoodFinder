{"text":"We've been to Tokoyo lobby twice. Both times were great. I'll start by saying I gave it four stars instead of five because it is small, small, small inside and the ambiance isn't fantastic. But the things you must do for good sushi!   I can't recall for certain the name of our favorite roll, but I believe it was the Glendale roll. Deep fried goodness is all I can say! I know, it isn't traditional sushi, but I just can't do raw fish! Nuff said. We tried two other kinds which were good as well, but the deep fried goodness overshadowed the other ones and I have erased them from my memory.   The pot stickers were ok, not fabulous. The green tea was great and came in cute little tea pots. I haven't had sake here and I don't know why, since I usually get sake. Guess I'd better head back for some more sake and sushi!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. Great selection of rolls and the Heart Attack appetizer may be the best appetizer in town. They have a bunch of new twists on old favorites and their Mexican roll is great. Also very impressed that they use a lot of halibut. Service is alright but they have great sake bomb prices to help you forget."}
{"text":"Great and fun place.  The owner is super nice and yes, they do shout \"welcome\" to you when you walk in, he he he.  I like that they have a LOT of specialty rolls, that keeps things new and exciting.  Try some of their deep fried rolls, freaking awesome!  The place is always packed.  You can easily get stuffed here."}
{"text":"I go to Tokyo Lobby all of the time because I LOVE IT! The rolls are freash and well made and the owner and staff are SUPER friendly. I even held an event with 40 people here and they handled it as if it was just me and 3 friends. Great prices, great place."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you immediately get the feeling as though you are in Tokyo; the atmosphere is great! I went for lunch and their lunch specials offer a lot of very high quality and tastefull food and a very fair cost. I highly reccamend it to anyone who enjoys Great Japanese Cuisine!"}
{"text":"Went in the recommendation from a friend. Very good sushi, however the service could have been better."}
{"text":"My first time here was a bit of a difficult experience. Not caring much for fish nor sushi didn't help. After going with a group of friends and trying different rolls greatly improved my desire for sushi. Their spring rolls are very delicious, and my favorite suhi is the Spicy Tuna. Service is awesome, they will wait for a decision if you need it. Happy Hour is perfect and its wonderful that they are open on Sundays now.  Sex on the Beach and Orgasm rolls melt in your mouth if you like a little banana with your roll ;)"}
{"text":"100% positive that this is my favorite sushi place in phoenix, arizona!!! i go there at least once a week. my absolute favorites are without fail the scorpion roll and the shrimp tempura roll. i tried a lot of different sushi places in phoenix, and none had me itching to come back- except for tokyo lobby. the owners/employees are sweetie pies and deserved every single tip i gave, and the food was satisfying every single time. i have recently moved about 9 hours away but every time i visit, i will make sure to stop at tokyo lobby. their sushi is impeccable."}
{"text":"I lived in Arizona for 20 years and have eaten at the best restaurants this state has to offer..I recently relocated to Florida and the last place I had dinner as i was driving out of town was here... I asked my wife's dad if I could marry his daughter here. I have celebrated every birthday at TL in the last ten years. I would bring kelvin music and he would come hang with me in the Dj booth at mcduffys back in the day, and I would do my very best to get him not sober..we became friends over great food and music.. He and Jen serve some of the best sushi not just in Arizona but in the country... you may go fishing in other places looking for sushi but you'll always return to Tokyo Lobby.. Baby lobster, orgasm roll, hamachi kama, monkey brains.. Ah, you will be missed TL, you will be missed..."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. Before going to Tokyo Grill, I was a 'fake' sushi lover. I liked sushi as long as there wasn't any raw fish. That being said my first visit there included a Bento box with spicy tuna. One little bite and I was hooked.  This last time I stuck to rolls spicy tuna and avocado, and 2 pieces of blue fin. The blue fin was a big step for me since up to this point, I really haven't liked the texture of raw tuna, but this was like butter.   My partner ordered the heart attack roll and a bento box. All were excellent.  We seem to keep ending up there on Friday nights, and previous posters are right, there is only one person taking orders, so on busy nights, be prepared to take your time. But it definitely worth it.  Only drawback for the evening is they forgot my Edamame. It wasn't on the bill either, but it bumps them down to 4.5 stars for the evening."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi spot. My friend brought me there for a girls night and have been there about 4 times already. I always get the orgasm and the Las Vegas. Absolutely love it.  The service is awesome and I love the lights are dim and ver intimate. Raving to everyone."}
{"text":"It has been many many years since I last stepped into Toyko Lobby, but I remembered that the experience was wonderful back then; so why not try again when I have a dinner-need on the Westside, right? Let's just say, I was NOT disappointed. I took my parents and son there, and we tried a few rolls, some entrees, and a few nigri. Everything was lovely and the staff was very nice and attentive. Plan to bring my husband up there (since we live in Ahwatukee) as soon as I can so he can try it all."}
{"text":"After an exhaustive search for good sushi with good prices in the West Valley, I decided to take hubby here for lunch after reading recent Yelpers' glowing reviews of the place. We are hard-core sushi lovers.  I SO WANTED this to replace our 2 favorite Scottsdale sushi restaurants (RA and Sapporo), because, frankly, while we are ALWAYS in the mood for good sushi, we would prefer not to deal with the crowds and noise or the 40 mins. travel time one way.      The good news is that I got my sushi fix. We got there at 2:00 p.m. which was considered Happy Hour, so we paid $19 for 2 spicy tuna rolls, a shrimp tempura roll, and a spicy crab and shrimp roll. I needed to pick up some things at Sprouts Farmers Market, so the location was also convenient. I will say that the sushi is slightly better than any other West Valley sushi restaurant we've been to including: 3 different Ah-So Sushi and Steak Restaurants (friends love the teppanyaki there), where the sushi is so bland and over-priced. K Sushi, where the rolls were overstuffed with rice, Yen Sushi & Sake Bar where EVERY roll was very warm (kinda gross for spicy tuna rolls), and Fresh Wasabi, where the sushi was nondescript.   Sushi review: spicy tuna rolls were in NO WAY spicy. We actually asked if they were the right order. The gal who answered said, \"Yes. Some people think it is VERRY spicy.\" At the same time, both my husband and I looked at each other like \"What?? You gotta be kidding!!\" We have to think those poor souls either have no or defective taste buds or they've never had sushi before. We were a bit disappointed as we were both craving SPICY tuna, not just tuna. It tasted just okay.   Shrimp tempura roll was decent. Spicy crab and shrimp roll? Again, in NO WAY did it have ANY heat level to it. It was pretty, and again, tasted okay. They provided a big mound of wasabi - they could have put 1/2 the amount and it would have been enough, and a big beautiful pile of sliced ginger (I love that stuff).  Staff was a bit aloof. As soon as we sat down we were told the restaurant was closing at 2:30 p.m. We immediately ordered, received our food, and were never asked how our food was or if we needed anything else. The bill was left, we paid, and there was no \"thank you\" or \"come again.\"   The search for the elusive good tasting and good priced sushi in the West Valley continues..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly and service is prompt.  I can't wait to come again to have yummy sushi."}
{"text":"If you like great sushi for good prices, go to Tokyo Lobby! Trust me, you won't be disappointed. The fish is fresh, every roll is made with attentive care, and the service is fast! The $5 sake bomber special is definitely something you shouldn't miss out on either. The atmosphere is cozy due to the dim lighting, and they play the 80's station for all those oldies but goodies. I could never get tired of Tokyo Lobby!"}
{"text":"Love Tokyo! David and my first date (along with 2 other restaurants in the same evening...) GREAT owners. Its great to see them expand."}
{"text":"The sushi was not at all good. The service was on the poor side. Our one and only visit was not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Made an order for pick up since this was super close to where I live, loved the Heart Attack (Jalape√±os stuffed with cream cheese and I think spicy tuna? deep friend in a tempura batter) Yum! Not the best Sushi I ever had but pretty good for a quick fix."}
{"text":"UNSANITARY DISGUSTING, and DISAPPOINTING!!!!  The place starts out with the waitress bringing me a tall boy Kirin with my glass upside down on the bottle!! Wow this person put their nasty hand on the nasty bottle then just plopped on my table like it's some juke joint? REALLY??? then she points out that it's happy hour-- NOTHING HAPPY ABOUT THIS PLACE!! The chef instead of saying excuse me or seeeemasen just hands over the sushi plate and to get my attention he says HELLLOOOO!!!!??? What is up with the staff? Mediocre sushi but hey it gets better the when the last morsel of food enters my mouth the waitress brings the bill- i still and half a beer left. So then she paces the floor and gives us the stink eye like I should pay and leave rudest poeple I've seen ever -then she picks up the bill o one of her 15 passes by my table sees I haven't hurried and leaves it straight up right NEXT to me so I will pay right away??? Wow how rude!! I even asked her if she had ever been to Japan or knew the customs where they alway fill your bottle again at half way and no she did not care and well REALLY??? DON'T WASTE MONEY HERE!!!! drive a few more blocks to 67th and bell and see how sushi and service is done. Instead of drinking your bottle of beer like you're at the curb."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Hands down wonderful sushi!!! First time here and we will definitely be back!! Service was awesome as well ; super friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Great food in the crappiest suburb of Phoenix.  Shoot me if I ever say I am moving to Phoenix.  I see old people...  I came here for dinner both nights last weekend, sat at the bar, drank Asahi and ate specialty rolls.  Friday night: Sex on the Beach (apparently not just a girly cocktail) and sea weed salad.  Very non-traditional: tasty tuna served in quarters of fried banana with spikes of seaweed. Nice julienned white radish in the center. Served without ginger or wasabi. Good sea weed salad. Went at 7 pm and place was full of 20 something trendy, trashy bar types, plus some families. Was immediately sat a the bar, otherwise would have waited for a table.  Saturday night: Fewer people at 8pm. Sat next to nice guy who had dropped his kids at the Free Zone. Specialty roll: Very spicy tuna roll with mango and it was. Came with wasabi only, but I did  not need it lol.  Again with the spiky seaweed. Side of cucumber salad good contrast to spiciness of roll. Fair green tea icecream afterward.  Such a pleasure to find this place.  Thank you local Yelpers, you did not fail me.  Nice patio seating, even if in a parking lot next to Payless (great landmark)."}
{"text":"I'm a person who loves sushi! All food for that matter. Eating here was a disappointment. The sushi wasn't great, it was bland. I order the same roll, no matter what sushi house I go to. My favorite, the dragon roll. First bit I took, I tasted nothing but cinnamon. I thought it could be just the first bit. So,  I Asked my girl friend if tasted like cinnamon to her, just to make sure it wasn't just me, she said, yes.  I'm a person who never complains about their food, let alone returns it. I apologized to our waitress and told her that my dragon roll tasted a lot like cinnamon. She told, \"yes, we add cinnamon to our eel sauce.\" (After looking at me like i was dumb.) I told her I never heard of anyone adding cinnamon to their sauce and if they did maybe they over did it. Again, looking at me like I was dumb, she said, \"no, that's how they are made.\" There's nothing wrong basically. Never once tried to apologies or make an attempt or offer to have another roll made. So, I told her this my favorite roll, I order it everywhere I go, I have never tasted cinnamon in it. She just shook her head and said, \"that's how they are made.\" Needless to say the two dragon rolls I ordered went to waste, plus the shrimp tempura, which tasted the same way were left behind. If she would have at least made and attempt to please the customer I would have given it a second star.  I am big on customer service. I always tip according to the service I receive, never the food."}
{"text":"This place is OK. When I first met my brother here, we were seated right away which is always nice, but i kinda felt rushed to order. We were given maybe 3 minutes to decide what we wanted. As soon as the lady came up we gave her our order and she grabs the menu out of my hand before I could ask her a question. Like she was in a rush..it wasn't even busy, which puzzled me a bit. Anyways, lets get down to the sushi..I for one am a big sushi snob. I know my sushi. From the freshness to the flavor, I know what's good and what isn't. We got our rolls and mackerel. Sadly, the rolls were small and covered in sauce. Not much fish in the rolls (disappointing.)..It was like the rice was choking the fish in the roll..too much of it.  The mackerel was very dry, and didn't really have flavor. Would I come back here?..most likely not. What attracted me to this place was the price, but it goes to show you, you really do get what you pay for. For you sushi lovers out there, I would look else where. This place didn't hit the spot for me.  Kind of funny, I was viewing the photos from other yelpers and my sushi looked nothing like their photos. Maybe it was just a bad night. If my rolls looked like how theirs looked then i might consider going back.."}
{"text":"I've tried this restaurant twice, and it hasn't been okay.  Getting decent sushi in the Valley seems to be based on whether or not the menu has 'Krab' on it or if they call it crab, even though it's that pressed mess that's not really crab.  I've been there once before and was pretty disappointed at the disconnect between the menu and the food that's brought to the table.    The california rolls are made with the pressed mackerel that's called crab - definitely not.  There's some kind of weird sauce they bring with the tempura - which seems to be made in panko batter instead of tempura batter - that tastes like apple cider vinegar.    What's worse, though, than the Krabb and the panko tempura is the sauce that seems to be drizzled on everything.  It's an over-done mix of what tastes like Chinese Five Spice and applesauce.    I know it's tough to find sushi in Glendale, but if you're hungry and in the shopping center where this place is, you're (sadly) better off going to Taco Bell.    The service is inattentive, the food is just not sushi, and the price is a little high for a place that serves unripe avocado in their rolls, and imitation crab in their rolls."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! My love for sushi began when my boyfriend and I started dating..5 years ago! We love this place! Their sushi is exceptionally mouth - watering and pleasing! Their fish is so fresh, everything melts in your mouth! My mouth is watering as I write this review! I think we have had every kind of sushi roll and they are all excellent..and have aesthetically pleasing style. The baby lobster rolls are my favorite but definitely highest in calories and I don't care! It's delicious! Their fried green tea ice cream they offer for dessert is a scrumptious and decadent treat!"}
{"text":"Wow...  Wow.  If only I'd found this place sooner, I wouldn't have spent so much time and money in lesser establishments.  Dead on with the food.  amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite sushi place in all of Phoenix. The food is always amazing and I recommend the Baby Lobster Roll. Kelvin (owner) is always very nice and talking to the tables to ensure that everything is perfect. While it can get a little busy on the weekends, that is just a sign of how good it is."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi in the state. Try the Lobster Roll."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for Tokyo Lobby, I decided that I had to try it. It was hands-down the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. Mostly because the rolls were so unique. We had 6 rolls and the sashimi platter and nothing disappointed us. My favorite was the Vegas Roll... it confused the crap out of my tastebuds... was it sweet, was it savory? I don't know. It was just amazing. Oh, and the prices were pretty phenomenal as well!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Phoenix area. We eat here frequently and  Have yet to be disappointed (but I've never ordered non sushi items like teriyaki or noodles). Food is great and the service is always prompt. Good happy hour specials too."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place. Great prices and great sushi. I love their sashimi and the orgasm role is a must have!!!!"}
{"text":"Nigiri.  Get the nigiri, skip the rolls. It's some of the freshest fish I've had in the valley and I've been to all the spots. This place deserves some extra recognition in these hard times however.  And don't mix wasabi into your soy bowl -- that's insulting to these nigiri sushis. The perfect amount of wasabi is already incorporated into the rice. Save your wasabi-soy stuff for the rolls.  And use your hands for the nigiri, chopsticks for rolls. Don't worry, that's what they do in Japan with nigiri. If you want, gently bathe the delicious fish across some soy and then shove it violently... I mean, place it onto your tongue, fish side down. (Trust me, this little etiquette lesson is accurate! and it makes you feel cool doing so).  Chew, enjoy. Chew, enjoy. Drink, drink. Chew, enjoy. Drink, drink. Drink, drink. (change it up occasionally) et cetera.  It's fabulous."}
{"text":"Yeah, thats a 5 star....I don't hand those out like candy....XD  Best happy hour than any sushi place......AND $5 bombers with large sake. They will bring you cold sake if you ask for it. IMO its better because it doesn't warm up your beer.  I go here on Fridays, probably once a month, maybe more. Went 3 weeks in a row when I first found it. Owners name is Kelvin, he is cooler than cool.... -273 degrees Celsius to be exact...XD He will take a photo of your group with his shhhweet camera and pin it to the cork board if you ask him to.  New happy hour menu is good  5 or 6 different $6 rolls. My favs are the eel and vegas.   Look for me if you go on a friday, we'll be the loud group in the corner drinking sake bombers hahaha"}
{"text":"This is consistently my \"go to\" sushi place.  They have great lunch specials and awesome rolls.  5 rolls and saki bombers for 3 people only a $50 tab. Great place, always busy."}
{"text":"I went here last night and enjoyed my meal. Their happy hour menu( though not extensive) had some decent selections, and wasn't too pricy. The sushi was good; I and my group enjoyed the salmon and yellowtail sashimi, the orgasm, some nigiri, and some cooked food. The only things I wasn't that fond of was the the spicy salmon roll, (I hate it when sushi restaurants drizzle spicy mayo on the top) and my halibut nigiri was too tough. The sake list was ok and during happy hour I saw that they do sake bombs for like $5. One of the things that really impressed me was the prompt, attentive service and how quickly the food came out, (hence the 4th star). All in all, I think this place is worth returning to if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"we love this place! do yourself a favor and try the playboy roll."}
{"text":"I love this place. Sushi is awesome! The place is small and comfortable for me. Never a long wait to get your food. I have to say I am a big sushi fan, this place beats RA and Benihana. I moved to Tucson and I will come here every time I can."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in town! Great ambiance, service, and solid fish.  Prices aren't bad either and they even offer a happy hour! It is difficult to find a good place in Phx being land locked and all but this place will do just fine."}
{"text":"Been here several times, good food but on several occasions they have forgotten menu items (miso soup for the bento box) or gotten out order wrong. Today bad service with no water refills. Just not worth it in my mind."}
{"text":"It's about time I write a review for this wonderful sushi place. My wife and I have eaten there about a half dozen times and we've yet to be disappointed. Yes there are rolls I wont order again because I don't like them but, there are also rolls I will order every time I walk into Tokyo Lobby. The fish is fresh, delicious and overall great. The owner obviously takes great care in procuring his product. The yellowtail scallion roll is my favorite on the menu. Chunky pieces of yellowtail are mixed with spicy mayo in side with slices of yellow tail and scallions on the top. The sushi is so good here that my 40 weeks pregnant wife decided to end her caring about food rules when it came to sushi here. As long as we live in this area this tiny little find will be our sushi joint."}
{"text":"Visited with my cousin  who is a regular... She ordered me fresh wasabi, my life is forever changed. The sushi tastes  fresh, servers and chefs are informative and friendly.  I have been back for take-out, can't wait to dine-in again!"}
{"text":"By far, one of my favorite sushi spots in Phoenix. Great little hole in the wall! The Las Vegas roll is a must!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food, friendly staff and good atmosphere. Makes me wish that I lived in Glendale, AZ."}
{"text":"I will never darken their doorstep again. I've had sub-par sushi before, but I have never, EVER left an establishment feeling ill after eating there. Couple that with their lazy service, lackluster flavor combinations (what is that gross sauce that they put on EVERYTHING??), and borderline microscopic portion sizes, it was absolutely NOT worth how much I paid. Never again. Ew."}
{"text":"There sushi is fair at best... if you really want the best sushi in town go to Sakanas. Not a very social atmosphere, the cooks are pretty much quiet and to themselves.. let alone ask for anything additional that is not on the menu. Rolls are simple and small, nothing really stands out.  If you really want a great night out, with the freshest fish, best service and all around atmosphere... SAKANAS."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi in the area. Terrible service and the sushi rolls are small and poor quality. Lunch specials are cheap for a reason. The rice is hard and stale and the rolls are tiny without much filling. Under poor management/ownership. Sakana right up the road or even Fry's on 67th Ave and Bell Rd have better quality and tasting sushi rolls. Don't waste your money here if you are a true sushi lover."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!  Don't think twice about calling in an order!!  The person answering the phone put me on a very long hold and then when taking the order, told me to call another restaurant to order because he did not like what \"I\" was ordering!!  I thought it was a joke when he was talking but was dead serious.  Its only a matter of time when this place closes.  There is no way they stay open with service like this!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why everyone's so crazy about this place.  I was craving sushi and happened to spot the sign while driving down Bell so I dropped in for takeout.  Prices were average for sushi.  The restaurant looked nice, but while I stood in a corner waiting for my food, I noticed the area I was standing in had a very sticky floor.  Not very pleasant.  I got a lunch special with chef's selection of nigiri and a spicy tuna roll.  I got home and opened the container to see my spicy tuna roll smothered with sauce.  I was kinda grossed out, but it turns out the sauce was necessary because the roll itself was the blandest I've ever hard.  The nigiri were also terribly bland.  It was a chore to eat them, which is really sad considering I love sushi.  One of the nigiri pieces had fish on it that tasted extremely earthy, like dirt.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN ALL OF ARIZONA. Been to many sushi places all over the country and this is hands down mine, and my family's favorite place. The freshness and creativity are the best you will find. Two words: Marilyn Mon-roll. Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town for the price. Happy hour is a bargain. Patio is nice especially during this time of year (spring)...highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite sushi restaurants.  Their Vegas rolls are to die for. Nice environment, great service, and an awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"Can never say enough about this place.  Service is always top notch. Sushi & sashimi are always fresh and tasty.  Great place for lunch or dinner.  Highly recommend for the picky sushi eater!"}
{"text":"Had a fun evening out with a group of friends, this place did not disappoint.  We were a large party, and the service started off slow at first.  However, between the socializing and laughter, the wait did not seem too bad.  Additionally, when the food arrived, any ill thoughts were put to rest by fresh sushi and new tastes.  We will be back when we are in the neighborhood.  Don't miss out, this place is really good!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because a friend suggested it, our server was pretty rude for the most part. Sushi was eh. I've had way better, and probably wont be eating here again."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi on the West Valley and probably in the Valley (for the price). Still open to try more places on the east side, but the prices will probably go up as the variety improves.  This is my go-to place for sushi: the rolls always come out quickly, it's always a solid serving size, and the food is always delicious and fresh!   Service wise: the waitress who seems to be on duty every time is attentive, quick and polite. I think some people mistake the minimal words as being cold, but no matter how busy or slow business is, she knows simply get you your order, refill your drink, and leave you alone: she doesn't pester you with fake and drawn out \"hiiii, how iiiiiis everythiiiiiing? Goooood? Okaaaaaay,\" which I appreciate. The sushi chefs may not say much, but as they begin to recognize you, they make it a point to greet you and say goodbye as you leave.  A must for all REAL sushi lovers with small wallets! And for those who eat fake/Americanized sushi-- this place will convert you to a real sushi lover."}
{"text":"Never ending happy hour!! This is my fave sushi place! Best spot for locals. Good service and good food. 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"GREAT SUSHI.  But I won't go back because the CHEF is a CONDESCDENDING JACKAZZ.  He was bragging about his knives and his style of cooking, so I asked him if he HAD EVER BEEN to JAPAN.  He said,  I am American, I am not Japanese,  I am from California......giving me the evil eye, ASSUMING that I thought he was Japanese.  NO,  I just asked if YOU HAD EVER BEEN TO JAPAN.  YOU OWN A JAPANESE RESTAURANT and YOU COOK JAPANESE cuisine and I thought that MAYYYYYBE,  you may have BEEN TO JAPAN.  SORRY DUDE, better brush up on your AMERICAN English!!   Also, he doesn't like baseball.  Refered to it as a STUPID GAME.  BAM!!  I never stepped foot back in there, and I was a regular customer.  A little niceness goes a long way."}
{"text":"im a big fan of  sushi.  this place is great, although small inside. The fried california rolls are to die for."}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I have been here probably over 15 times in the past 3 years, ever since it was across the parking lot! I have no clue what others are saying bad about this place, it is the best I've had, and they don't Americanize the cuisine! Well worth the price and very friendly service."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered Tokyo Lobby last month (thanks to Yelp!) and we've been five times so far. The service is great, the atmosphere is inviting, and the food is amazing. I highly recommend the miso soup and the Philly roll (though the \"salmon cream cheese roll\" is almost the same thing and is half the price of the Philly if you go during happy hour)."}
{"text":"This is just about the WORST sushi place I have ever been. The sushi was mediocre at best but honestly that wasn't the worst part. The service was TERRIBLE. I came in with two other friends and we sat on one of their patios around 6 o'clock on a Sunday night. The inside of the restaurant had 3-4 tables and there were 2 on the patio we sat on. I We waited about 7-8 minutes for someone to greet us and take our drink order and then about 9-10 minutes to get said drinks. It was all downhill from there. Needless to say we'll never come back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Its good and consistent. Its not my favorite sushi place but my wife and daughter enjoy it and its conveniently located for us."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Tokyo Lobby!  I go there at least once a week for lunch or dinner.  It is a little jewel in a strip mall that I though was my little secret :)  The restaurant was introduced to us about 2 years ago through a friend's ex, but that's another story.  At that time it was in a much smaller space, but within the last year they have relocated to a much nicer location.    The sushi is phenomenal!  The best I have had in the valley, and I have tried many.  The rolls are to die for - large, flavorful, fresh and they never skimp on portion size or taste.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  Good sake, many flavors and sake bombers - hey why not?   Must try: baby lobster roll, crunch roll, monkey brains and heart attack  (mmmm...i'm salivating just thinking about it!)"}
{"text":"Their food is good, but the service is crap. I liked how it tasted, but it took an hour just waiting for the bill. And even longer for me to get my card back!! I left satisfied in my stomach, but not with my service. The server was slow with getting refills, and people who came before us got served their food. The food was excellent, though. Hoping for better service next time. Maybe more employees for faster service."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant! My second favorite is kabuki at west gate. This place has friendly staff, great sushi, and awesome location and interior design, very clean and organized! Would recommend to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Dear reviewers reading, I always read reviews on places I visit before I go especially if it's a place I never been to, my friend dragged me into this place I thought he been here before turns out he has not HA!   So we walk in and it's a cute little place not huge to seat like a ton of people but just the right amount, we actually walked in at 4:47pm and they open at 5pm so we were embarrassed and they told us we could have a seat and wait but we were like no we will just go to shop around come back. It was funny but so embarrassing at the same time.   We heard it gets packed really quick and then when 5:20ish rolled around we went in and we were the first people there the lady came got us drinks right away and we were greeted so kindly by the sushi chiefs. Right after we got our drinks like 3 other groups showed up and we started noticing the place fills up quick.   A lot of people were reviewing on how they rush you and make you hurry but I did not experience any of that, I been to higher/expensive sushi restaurants that do rush and hurry you, but here everything seemed to be more calm and relaxed. Our waitress actually took her time with everything and not rushing us to order and giving us ample time to look around and ask questions.   All in all it was a very cute and charming place, a lot of people said in other reviews that the food wasn't great, it was just normal not too over the top and not too under. Very normal and settling. I ordered Gyoza and Udon very delish both were. My friends order rainbow roll and miso soup with various rolls they enjoyed there food."}
{"text":"Definitely has some very unique rolls for people to experiment with. Love coming here, and wish it was closer so I could frequent more often.  The food is fresh, everything is prepared where you can watch them work. Very flavorful, very tender. Definitely the place to go for the the sushi lover."}
{"text":"Mmmm.... Volcano roll.....  I ordered several rolls to go, and like always, wasn't disappointed. My brother in law always requests that we eat here when he comes to town to visit.   Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and very friendly staff. This has become our go to place for sushi. We've had so many different pieces of sushi and sashimi and it's always delicious."}
{"text":"Tokyo Lobby is hands down my favorite sushi bar in Phoenix area. I've been there countless times and have never been let down.  I usually start with the miso soup and monkey brains for appetizers.  Always get their mackerel saba sashimi (amazing).  For rolls: Caterpillar Roll or any of their eel is amazing. Las Vegas Roll Spicy scallop roll Rainbow Roll (always fresh) Shrimp Tempura Roll and will alternate between tuna roll and yellowtail rolls.  Their service is fantastic, their food is amazing, and I never hesitate to bring my little brothers because they always have suggestions for kids.   Five stars!"}
{"text":"High quality sushi and fast service! Love this place. I've had a variety of rolls, sashimi and dishes and everything has been fresh and delcious."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to our beloved sushi place but three bad visits in a row has turned us off.  Not sure if the summer season just affected the quality or if being slow in the summer caused them to cheapen, but either way not a good result.  Will wait till winter possibly to give another try but for now on a break."}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice and it is yummy.  The rolls are superb and there are lots of choices.  We ordered the \"What is that\" roll and it was perfect!  The spicy tuna roll is good.  My husband likes the \"cooked\" sushi so sticks with the spider roll, shrimp tempura roll, and spicy california roll  - all were great.  Lots of beer and saki drink specials on Friday evening if you are into that.    The service was awesome and by 6:15 on a Friday night it is packed."}
{"text":"We go to Phoenix on business very often and found this awesome sushi place. Best sushi we have had anywhere and we travel a lot. Saw the sushi chefs name is Mickey. Every time we have gone he is the one working. He makes incredible plates and the sushi has tons of flavor. My husband always complains other places don't make his right. Too bad we have to go all the way to Phoenix to get awesome sushi. The people working there are nice. Our service was great but I was impressed with the skill of this chef and his plates. We will be stopping in every time we end up in the Phoenix area. The only thing I was disappointed in was we always tip the chef separate from our entire check but didn't see others do the same. Don't forget to tip your sushi chef! We've seen this many times I guess most don't know. Thanks for the great food. We will be back"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and LOVE the Baby Lobster Roll. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my day having lived in Seattle and really enjoy this place. It's small and pretty quiet too. I've always had good service."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place rather than Yens (my usual spot) because they had different happy hour options. We walked in and order the 5$ sake bomber. Waitress didn't let us know that they require a 10$ minimum EACH sake bomb so we were forced to by more food. The guy was rude, and I just ended up taking two extra orders of sushi home because I was stuffed. I'm not really excited for old sushi...   On Sunday's they are open till 9pm, they have happy hour all day 5-9. So at 830 they did last call for drinks...  The waitress kept hovering around our table and it made me really uncomfortable. Especially when she gave the check, she kept walking around our table and staring at the check book. A couple walked in at 8:40pm and they said they already closed the bar and food and made them leave. If you want to go home so bad; WHY AREN'T YOU JUST CLOSED AT 8:30? Stupid. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Miso soup has a light flavor- I do like the fresh mushrooms and green  they added...I ordered the beef bento it came wih rice, soup, salad, 2 -4 piece sushi (8.95) rolls a my daughter ordered the dragon roll (10.95)... sushi was just ok, salad was good, beef was good nothing was great except the service. Our food came out extremely fast they we're friendly, and checked often on us."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here the other night because they were open until 10:30pm and it had happy hour deals. Note, we were both cold during the whole meal because it seemed they were cleaning up and bringing things in from the patio so the door kept opening and closing. Neither one of us took our coats off!   I agree with the other posts about its customer service. We were helped quickly, and the staff was friendly. However, I think the happy hour menu is fairly limited compared to others I have seen. The $5 sake bomb, though, is a great deal. My sister and I ordered spicy tuna rolls and some hand rolls (salmon and salmon skin). The hand rolls were a pretty generous portion, but I would've liked maybe a slice of cucumber or something in my salmon hand roll. The thing that knocked it to a three star for me is that the spicy tuna roll is topped with spicy mayo - dislike!!   Unfortunately with other places nearby that are on par to Tokyo Lobby, I don't see myself coming back or at least suggesting this sushi place."}
{"text":"I rarely ever bite my tounge but in this case I will.  After trying out many sushi places in the area, this is by far the best.  I have yet to eat something at Tokyo Lobby I do not like.  Well worth the price and wait, at times.  The Fiesta roll has become one of my favorites.  I also really like the Heart Attack.  Its like playing Russian Roulette.  Sometimes you get a mild one and sometimes you feel the burn.  This place well deserves the 5 stars.  I completely believe the Hype now..."}
{"text":"First time here and last, there are to many other places to eat decent sushi that I won't have to go back to this place. When I got there on a Friday night after 8:00, we were seated at the last table that was part of the prep area or kitchen not sure which. I asked the server if they had any happy hour specials and she said no, I turned the menu around and they had a big red area that said happy hour! I asked another server if this was good right now and she said yes, so I guess the first one didn't hear me correctly. Anyway, the sushi tasted like it was pre packaged and not good. I can't figure out where all the 5 star reviews come from."}
{"text":"Just arrived here for dinner with my spouse. We were greeted promptly and sat at the bar. Shortly after, the waitress took our drink order and then we sat and waited and waited and waited some more for our drinks or food order to be taken.  I signaled the manager guy and he said he would get them. 10 minutes later, still nothing. So we flagged down the waitress and she said she couldn't get it because it was alcohol and she wasn't old enough and to continue waiting. Another 5 minutes went by and nothing. As soon as we stood up to leave in frustration, the manager hurried over and said he would grab the drinks.  We left instead.  Waiting that long for drinks or to order without any help is ridiculous and they just lost out on at least a $100 order."}
{"text":"Tokyo Lobby is always consistent with fresh, well prepared and plated sushi. The staff are always prompt and kind which is another reason this place is my favorite. I encourage everyone to try this joint at least once and experience the great time you'll have."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch, $6 Las Vegas roll and I always have the heart attack roll as well. Really good service and clean environment."}
{"text":"Please read thru: Good Happy Hour, which is basically all night. I've been here many times. Good happy hour menu and price. I'm not an \"expert\" on sushi but to me, the HH food is good. I have never ordered anything from the regular menu. Why pay full price.   New people, just a heads up....1) The servers will not mention to check the menu for their \"Happy Hour\" prices, which are all day. 2) Staff is not friendly. They go about their business, which is....keep bugging you till you order.   Tonight was awful. We waited for our food for a long time. I asked a server about our food and he said there was a big party they were serving. The table next to us was getting their food (dessert) before us. We had ordered way before they did. I walked into the restaurant (we were sitting outside) to check out the \"big party\". There were only two other tables being served. Turns out...,this \"Big Party\" was next to us. Big Party (7 who had already eaten) trumps table of two. Server continued to ignore us.   I give this place a 2star rating only because of the service tonight and the server being rude."}
{"text":"I walked in initially thinking the restaurant was small but jokes on me, there was a second patio in the back that could accommodate our large group. We were seated relatively quickly and waited quite a bit after the rest of our group had arrived to order. It took a while for them to make our entrees and have it out to us. Had we been a smaller group I think the service would have been quicker. But the waitresses were nice, the owner was very funny and the food was amazing. There isn't much outdoor lighting on the back patio (save for the passing cars and Christmas lights on the gates) so if you have poor eyesight or need lights, I would suggest to be seated indoors at night.   The foods amazing, the service is great, totally suggest!"}
{"text":"Good Americanized sushi I suppose. The rice didn't have much flavor and the rolls were burrito sized which forces you to either stuff your mouth or ungracefully rip the piece apart. The restaurant itself is a bit cramped and crowded during rush hours. Great sake bomb drink deals though."}
{"text":"One of my fiance and I's favorite restaurants, Tokyo Lobby has a great atmosphere and even better food...  we always start out with the gyoza...the dumplings come out hot and steaming, with the perfect, slightly crisped skin...  last time we were there around lunchtime, and my fiance ordered a teriyaki chicken bento box for his meal--tempura veggies, teriyaki chicken, rice, 4 rolls of sushi, and a salad with some sweet dressing, all for $7...incredible!...  I ordered my usual--the Glendale Roll(lobster-filled sushi rolls, deep-fried and drizzled with a sweet, slightly spicy sauce)--the most incredible thing you'll ever taste, and my favorite food on the planet!  Tokyo Lobby has the atmosphere and service of a fine-dining restaurant without the priceyness...a great place to have fun eating!"}
{"text":"The most creative sushi rolls you will find almost anywhere. Although Korean owned, this is my favorite sushi spot in Arizona. Try the Marilyn Monroe roll, unstoppable."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese restaurant that I have been to in the Phoenix area. Okay, it's the only Japanese restaurant I've been to in the area, but it is as good as any that I have ever visited. Food is tasty, atmosphere is nice and the price is right. we had a lovely lunch on the patio with perfect 70¬∞ January weather. Got a love the winter in Phoenix. Got to hate the summers though unless you think you will enjoy hell :-)"}
{"text":"Anyone knocking Tokyo Lobby registers as a sushi novice, in my book. Service is bad...blah, blah, blah...sit at the bar and enjoy the best sushi(by far) on the west side. The Tuna Tataki & the \"What the Heck\" roll will change your life. Ignore the haters and enjoy. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona! No matter how many other sushi places I try, I always come back to Tokyo Lobby. Great service, fair prices and always delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm always encouraged when sushi chefs have no idea what I'm saying and when other Asians patronize the place.   So when the Tokyo Lobby sushi chef stared at me blankly when I asked a question, I thought, oh my gosh, that must mean that he's like really Japanese or something.   And when the Sun City Asian ladies rolled in for lunch - its fate was sealed.  My sushi confidence shot straight up.  Nice!  For the past 3 years I avoided this place.  Why would any respectable sushi place locate itself in an aging dumpy Walmart strip mall?  I peeked inside way back when and wasn't impressed.  But after reviews of this place, I knew I had to check it out.  Wow, was I wrong.  This place holds its own against any Scottsdale sushi joint, without the flash.  It moved into its new location within the strip mall last week, and it's a bit bigger, more modern, but still modest.  My second visit (today) I tried the bento box - a steal at only $7 that comes with teriyaki beef, rice, spicy tuna, california roll, salad and miso soup.   And I've been stuffed all day.   The highlights here clearly are the inventive rolls - reminds me a bit of Blue Wasabi with cutesie names like the Glendale roll and the Monkeyface roll (crab, fried mushrooms and avocados).  Mmmm.  This has definite 5 star potential, I'm just waiting for my next visit."}
{"text":"Awsome little sushi place! I recommend the Glendale roll but it fills you up fast so leave some room for a few saki bombs!"}
{"text":"Favorite Sushi Spot. I come here every time I go back home to visit. They have a huge variety and I love their soup! Very Friendly and great for big groups and late night sushi."}
{"text":"The Baby Lobster and Las Vegas rolls are absolutely amazing! Great service and staff is always friendly. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I think the previous reviews pretty much covered everything. I just wanted to add that the octopus salad was really tasty and tender. Of course, the ahi sushi was top grade as well. I will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, really.  The prices were great, especially the $5 Sake Bomber special.  But overall, the food was just not sexy at all."}
{"text":"Love this place. Sushi is always great. I am a roll fan. Have tried many of theirs and love each one. Enjoy the 80's music and the saki bombers too. They offer a full menu so there is something for everyone here. Clean, fast, casual dining. Been going here for a few years... not planning to stop any time soon."}
{"text":"Be careful when ordering! Apparently, they put roe (fish eggs) on everything but don't specific whether it comes on it. I ordered sashimi and it came out with roe."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this little gem for years, even back when it was in another location.  It just keep getting better.  Great service and fresh, wonderfully prepared sushi and sashimi.  It has never disappointed us."}
{"text":"I've been to Tokyo Lobby for lunch several times during a regular work week.  Their bento boxes are mediocre because their California Rolls contain less than fresh avocados and overcooked rice.  I've had their spider rolls, unagi, and monkey brains and those were flavorful.  It's a decent place for lunch but I wouldn't go there for dinner and pay full price for just okay food."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I live this place the sushi is a work of art. They have a great out door patio. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"Yelp really let me down on this one or maybe I am just used to a sushi places that offers favorable food. The service at first I thought was polite and fast but as the time went by our waitress didn't even send to care if we needed drinks or anything else. The trash can in the bathroom was overfilled and was in need of some attention. Now the food, I love spicy tuna and I love it because I like a level of heat in my food. The place we normally go to has excellent spicy tuna but this place was just blah. The texture was more of a mousse and it had no flavor. The wasabi was also one of cheap brand that looked like a paste and again just not something I am used too. I expect to use a little and it goes a long way. This wasabi had no heat. My boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken which he said was dry and hard to chew. The sauce was good in flavor but the chicken itself was not good. Not impress and felt really let down by Yelp . Guess I will just continue to go to my regular sushi place"}
{"text":"Fast service, Great happy hour, get there early, it gets busy.  The wait is very much worth it."}
{"text":"Always my go-to for sushi here in Glendale. The spicy crab/shrimp roll is the best...I order it every time I come here. Their Vegas roll is very good too."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi, this is where I go. I've tried plenty of establishments but this one is still my favorite. The pricing is fair and the food is even better. Many times sushi is priced very high and the sushi itself is not particularly outstanding.   It's usually super packed and busy here, so it is usually loud and it is a small space if that bothers some people.  The service is pretty straight forward, less smiles but very quick.   The bathrooms are fantastic, high end, and gorgeous, and always clean and there are tv's which usually show sports. I've seen football, baseball, and basketball playing there.   The dessert menu is as good as the food menu, they haven't missed anything.  Try to come during their happy hour or reversed happy hour, crazy prices for amazing food, especially sushi!   Let me put it this way, I have turned 4 people that said, \"I don't like sushi\" into \"I love sushi!\" after taking them here."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and we will be back. My family and I enjoyed a good dinner. The food was delicious. I had several sushi rolls. They were fresh and tasty. My husband had the tempara undon which is a noodle soup. He said \"it was on hit\". The environment is very casual. The waiters were very accommodating. We loved it!"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is delicious. Easily, the best sushi I have had in Phoenix. The service was fantastic, and very friendly. I could not finish a glass of water before the waitress came to refill my glass. The food was absolutely phenomenal, and was served quickly. We will definitely be back soon. I highly recommend the Las Vegas sushi roll."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi-holic, and Tokyo Lobby met my needs.  Ahi Tuna was excellent, nice selection of nagiri, shashimi, and rolls.  Average pricing for sushi and the service was quick.  It's in a strip mall parking lot, so there's not a ton of space and nothing special for an atmosphere, but I'd go back."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite sushi joint! The service is great, the sushi is BOMB AF, and the atmosphere is perfect! I'm not going to lie, I definitely have shopped around for different sushi restaurants, but this is easily my favorite in the Glendale area. Another plus, they have a happy hour menu with discounted sushi rolls and Sake bombs! Try it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"YUMMY...went here for dinner. It was packed, but what do you expect on a Saturday? I sat down, and no one greeted me for a drink order till the rest of the family arrived. So for a good 15 minutes I sat  with my ID in my hand and some major puppy eyes. I really needed a drink BAD. Long day at work and I showed up early just so that I can order it before everyone got there. For some reason I just can't order booze in front of my grandma. Luckily my dad ordered sake so I was brave enough to order my large sapporo. It was really busy so service was slow, I didn't get my water till after we had already got our food. Boy, did we get a lot of food. My grandma is a garbage disposal, she is a true champ. What did we get.......calamari salad, veg. tempura, heart attack roll, lady special roll, salmon skin roll, edamame, 2 orders spicy tuna roll, eel roll, salmon roll, and himachi kama. I think that's it? I only had some of the heart attack roll which was FABOLOUS!!! Spicy tuna roll is always good and some veggie tempura which was good except the zuccinni it was really mushy and gooey. End of it all, the check was a bill...but it was a ton of food and OOOOO so good. I'd give it 5 stars, but California has way better sushi bars."}
{"text":"The sushi at this place is simply AMAZING! They do such a good job here. Everything is fresh and tastes great. Prices are pretty good. I would say they are moderately expensive on the low end. They have a vast menus of noodles and other entrees. You can find many different alcoholic drinks as well. There is a small sushi bar and the place is nicely decorated inside. Outside of the restaurant has cool decorations as well. A few tables are available outside to sit at.  They have excellent service. Their waiters are kind, courteous and make sure you get taken care of. The place seemed to be managed very well.  Parking is easy and close to the restaurant.  I recommend everyone to try this place out. Even if you don't like sushi, come and try it. Once you try it you will change your mind. ;P"}
{"text":"Mediocre.... That's all I can say about this place. Limited drink option, ok sushi, ok service and ok price. No wait on Saturday night, I guess that was good. They have reverse happy hour from 9 pm daily with pretty limited selection."}
{"text":"Craving Tokyo Lobby as I write this, one of the top spots on the W Bell Rd Sushi corridor! Great food, great service, always a fun time!"}
{"text":"I'll start this off by saying Tokyo Lobby used to be one of my top sushi spots, really great sushi and rolls, and appetizers were always on point as well.  It's been a few years since I was last at Tokyo Lobby and decided to stop by this weekend to pick up dinner for my son and I. So disappointing :(  The rolls were not bad, and that's the only thing keeping this review above one star. We ordered a salmon roll and an ell roll - Both were good, nothing spectacular, but they weren't bad by any means. The rest of the meal was a disaster. The calamari...oh my god, I don't even know what to say about the calamari. I've never in my life had a legit bad order, but this...yeah, i don't even have words. It was like rubber bands covered in what I'd assume was some sort of panko breading. But the breading wasn't golden like it should have been, it was ghost white and completely lacking any flavor whatsoever. I tried one and couldn't get myself to eat anymore. My son who normally loves calamari didn't even try it. The beef teryaki was cold, and dry which was consistent with the rest of the disappointing meal.  I always like to give the benefit of the doubt, and maybe they were just having an off day, but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon to find out."}
{"text":"Really creative sushi and you gotta love a place that has the bento box."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Phoenix. They have awesome specials including 5$ sake bombs. The sushi is absolutely delicious and perfectly sized....and the tempura banana for dessert is like a trip to heaven."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat/fish so my usuals are the avocado roll, cucumber roll and the seaweed salad.  It's hard to mess those up, but I've had my share of \"what was that!?!?!\" I've never been disappointed with Tokyo Lobby.  My friends and family rave about the Las Vegas roll and baked mussels.  Great service, food comes out quickly, no fuss.  I moved here from So Cal and it has been difficult to find a sushi place that comes close to the places we frequented back home.  We've stopped searching thanks to Tokyo Lobby."}
{"text":"Customer service has ALWAYS been on point.... Specialty Rolls are amazingly delicious and cannot be beaten. One of my favorite things is they have spicy garlic edamame as well...... nice ambient place inside and also have a gr at outdoor seating area that gets lit up at night.  Very nice place."}
{"text":"The best and tastiest sushi on the west side!  I've been to this place so far about 6 times and always around lunch hour during the week and weekends.  The husband hates anything fish and he loves this place for the atmosphere and the teriyaki chicken (which is delicious).  This is the only place the husband will gladly take me to indulge my sushi addiction.  First, they enthusiastically greet you on coming in and the waitresses/servers immediately take your drink order.  They are super nice and happy to help the most novice of eaters.  I may love sushi but have a hard time with chopsticks and while trying to use them for the millionth time, one of the servers laughed with me and handed me these training chopsticks.  Not only hysterical but they worked!  They are nice, welcoming and the food is so good it can't be described properly.  The sushi is extremely fresh, well cut and served at just the right temperature.  The sashimi is decent sized cuts of whatever fish served with a wonderful side of green relish.  They have a ton of variety of rolls from raw fish to deep fried.  Be patient with them as some may not have perfect English although they understand perfectly.  They are very very nice and seem to enjoy their customers.  The entire place is a little small with a couple outdoor patios cooled with misters and if you have to wait, it is more than worth it.  The prices are medium not being over the top and not being the cheapest though the food is to die for delicious cooked or not.  The servers are especially gracious with my own weirdness because I don't eat rice so I wind up eating the fish and the center of the roll then moving aside the rice/seaweed.  Even doing that, the servers are gracious and understanding.  Delicious, tasty and a relaxing atmosphere that will put anyone at ease.  No clue about the happy hour or other times so this is all about the lunch hour.  For a great lunch, try Tokyo Lobby!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I decided to take my brother here who was in town for my birthday. He and I are fans for this uncooked cuisine. We have to say that this place did not disappoint. We tried the seaweed salad (my first time to try this, very good) to start. We then ordered a couple different rolls and some nigri. All was very tasty and melted in my mouth. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi.   My ten year old son just proclaimed this to be his new favorite place (he loved the beef teriyaki).    And the lollipop roll at the end served as a great dessert.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Eww. Dry chewy food. Not even fresh quality.  Should be shut down. The seaweed on the rolls are bad and the sauces they use are tasteless and disqualified for any foodie."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place doesn't have 5 stars!   Absolutely the best Sushi in the greater Phoenix area.   They also have friendly staff, and awesome happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Warm and welcoming atmosphere, attentive service, and GREAT food. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We will go back again. In fact, I regret not having visited sooner."}
{"text":"Best place to get Sushi in the valley - Hiro works there!!!    I used to go to 'the Lobby' for lunch with some customers a lot, and it has always been really good.  When Shiro closed, this became our family sushi place, too.  Then, one day, (Oct 15, 2013, to be exact), we dropped in and there was Hiro!!!  (If you used to get sushi at that place by the Biltmore way back when, that's the Hiro I'm talking about - check my photos - there's a shot from when we found him)  OK, enough fan worship of the Valley's best sushi chef, let's get down to the review.  This is a nice, friendly place on the west side of town.  They have sushi and sashimi, along with a full menu of noodles, tempura, etc.  The fish is consistently very good here!  And all the guys behind the counter do a great job with it (not just Hiro).  The serving staff is also very friendly and attentive.  Why did this become the family sushi place?  Because of what my wife calls \"Chick Rolls\" - things that aren't 'traditional'.  If you like some maki, this is a great place to try some really fun, creative and tasty rolls!  I like the What the Heck roll - very spicy.  The Volcano roll is a crowd pleaser (and comes with lots of healthy veggies mixed in with the scallops and crab).  My wife and daughter's favorite, though, is the Sex on the Beach roll.  This is Maguro (Ahi) on top of a fried banana (and I'm not sure what all else).  The ladies love it!  (This is the first non-California type roll to start expanding my daughter's world of sushi, so I'm into their debt for opening up her palate to more kinds of fish!  :-))  I can't believe I've never reviewed the Lobby before...I guess I'm a recovering Yelp slacker...  Anyway, run - don't walk, to Tokyo Lobby.  If you're not sure what you want, just sit at the bar in front of Hiro and tell him to hook you up - tell him I sent you.  My son and I have entrusted many a tasty sushi meal to his talents and recommendations."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place for years! My husband and I finally decided to try it out. And man were we disappointed.. THAT WE HADN'T TRIED IT SOONER! We had the Musashi Roll (Spicy tuna, shrimp tempura,  and avocado $6) and 2 Saki bombs ($5/each) to start. All on Happy Hour! Then we had the oh so amazing and filling Monkey Brains (Spicy Crab inside a Tempura Mushroom!) We were STUFFED!! Our bill was so low we couldn't believe it! The service was good! Parking is a little strange but works. Atmosphere was very cute. Pretty normal for a smaller sushi place. I really love the patio (I love patios!) but it was just too hot that day. Can't wait to come back, try more, and sit on the patio!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for the first time last lift for late night happy hour - on a Saturday! Which was really nice to find since most restaurants don't have happy hours on the weekend.  The service was fantastic! I couldn't tell you who my server was because it seemed like every time something was brought to our table it was someone different. But not in a bad way at all. It felt as if everyone on the staff cared about all of the tables not just their own.  It is a smaller restaurant - nice ambience with a sushi bar or tables to sit at inside. I saw they had tables outside as well.   We got the California roll and Shrimp Tempura & they were really good.   We decided to try the crazy roll which was a fried cream cheese, avocado, crab roll. Very good and very rich!  Would definitely come back to this place. Great service - good came out quick and always had a fresh drink."}
{"text":"New favorite sushi place. The roll names are hilarious and even better they're delicious too! Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Still excellent after all these years!!  Please note: I was really excited when a food delivery service had TL on thier list. DD are the initials. Use DD at your own risk...and my experience dictates the risk is very high that you will be highly disappointed. NOT with TL but DD. Drivec eat in our take it home yourself."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Tokyo Lobby about 3 months ago and I have been coming back on average about twice a month ever since.  I absolutely love this Sushi Restaurant.  I prefer to sit at the bar and not at a table.  Very small establishment, but the food is deliscious.  Everytime I order I get a Sapporo Japanese Beer, some warm saki on the side and food I order the Eel roll and a Vegas roll.  Both rolls are partially deep fried with tempura and are extremely good!  I can't get away from them.  I have been anxious to try other things on the menu but I just can't get away from those 2 rolls.  My girlfriend usually gets one of hte boxes that comes with rice, soup, meat, sushi and a house salad.  Prices are great!  Its like having scottsdale sushi in glendale with great prices."}
{"text":"This is my to-go-to sushi spot. Great location on bell road. The place itself is pretty small and intimate which usually is what I tend to like. They have really cute patio...by cute I mean it has a little romantic vibe to it. Great place for a date night or just to hang out with the ladies.   The food here is pretty good. My usual is the spicy tuna roll and Mexican roll with miso soup of course. They just changed their happy hour which is awesome because Monday-Thursday is happy hour all day! Now who wouldn't love that?!  With all that being said, the only thing I wish they would work on is customer service. For some reason the last past 3 times I've been here I tend to feel rushed. Servers are polite but I feel like they just want me to hurry up and eat then leave right after. I hope this changes because I truly like this place and wouldn't want to go else where for sushi. Till next time Tokyo Lobby!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for the shrimp ebi I usually get 5 orders and a green tea. I love the people that work there because today i was in too much pain to get down and she brought it out to my car which was really sweet. I recommend this place for the yummy sushi and good service."}
{"text":"It's been a while, so I'm going to update.   So... I've been going here since 2004... on average, at least 3 times a month.  I swear that when I win the lottery, I am stealing Kelvin and Jennifer from all of you so they can be my personal chefs.  Sorry ya'll. :-)  The food quality hasn't changed (which is absolutely THE BEST... and I've tried a lot of sushi places to compare it to)... Kelvin and Jennifer haven't changed... they have a massive TV to check out either an Iron Chef competition or the local ballgame.  They are now open ALL DAY.  YAY!!!!  What's cool is that recently they updated their happy hour special... special priced rolls from 11:00am to 2:30pm every single day... and they have a special where you can get a large beer and a small sake for $5!  NICE.  Bring that on.  I mentioned that to a friend recently... and he said, \"That's a great deal... and a whole lotta trouble!\"  If there's anywhere where I want to get in trouble... it's at Tokyo Lobby.   They are my sushi family. :-)"}
{"text":"There isn't much more I can say that everyone else already has.  But I am happy that the west side has such a great sushi restaurant, b/c I am tired of driving all the way out to Scottsdale for the right sushi.    A friend and I shared the Spicy Tuna Rolls and the Fiesta Salmon Roll.  Both were delicious and just the right amount of spicy.  We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef recommended we order the Fiesta Salmon Roll, especially if we liked spicy sushi.  He was right...it was very good, but definitely more spicy than the regular ol' spicy tuna roll, and it was very colorful!    Just like others have already posted, it is in a very non-sushi type location stuck next to a Payless Shoe Source.  Don't be fooled by the exterior.  We went on a Monday afternoon during lunch and there was a steady wave of people coming in and out...always a great sign!"}
{"text":"It was okay, but \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" We were a party of 6 on a Thursday night. They made it clear that they close by 9:30pm and that they were ready for us to go. However,the server was pretty friendly and fast.  The food was just okay. The rolls were very average at best, not tightly rolled. The Catepillar roll had a very sweet eel sauce (more like a maple flavored sauce) and it was hard to eat. We had to remind them that our order was not all complete...perhaps in the rush to get our food out so we could leave by the time they closed, they may have overlooked or order.   I'm confused about how this place got such high reviews, since they didn't even come close in my experience."}
{"text":"I've tried at least a dozen sushi spots in the Valley and Tokyo Lobby is by far the best.  No \"pre-cut\" fish here like some other sushi bars.  The fish is incredibly fresh, in fact, certain items can be difficult to get if you don't show up on day they received it (mirugai and uni in particular).    The nigiri and sashimi are always generous slices of fish, and the rolls have a flair that sets Tokyo Lobby a cut above the others.  Some of my favorites are the Fiesta roll, Alaska roll, and the Playboy roll.   Also highly recommend the \"kama\" which is a steamed fish cheek (lots of meat) served hot. Presentation is quite neat, with a simple elegance rather than the showiness of some other trendy spots.    It's a family-owned restaurant, and can be quite busy on the weekends as it's relatively small and often packed.  However, I generally stop by once a week during the middle of the week, and rarely have trouble getting a seat around 6:30pm.  The staff is friendly and polite, and you can quickly become a \"regular\" there between the excellent service and top-notch quality sushi.  The prices are reasonable, in fact, cheaper than many other sushi restaurants I've visited in Phoenix.  I've never felt rushed sitting at the bar.  It's a great place to bring a few friends and just sit and enjoy fantastic Japanese food.  They play an 80's station most of the time and it isn't too loud so you can chat comfortably with pals."}
{"text":"The team work in this place is amazing. Everyone works together so well.  Our sushi was very very good. The best we've had. The service was very quick! We're definitely going back with friends next time. The only thing I wasn't impressed with is the ice tea wasn't very good."}
{"text":"The Glendale Roll and the Baby Lobster Roll are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  This is THE PLACE to go to for great sushi.  Always super fresh, always fast service.  It's can get busy as it's a small location for how popular it is, so try to get their before the main dinner rush!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! We were shocked at the quality of sushi that we got in this strip mall sushi joint. A must try!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi spot on the 'west' side of town. They have happy hour prices most of the time and they're very quick. Their sushi is good and fresh and I've never been disappointed. Their orgasm roll is amazing!! And they play old 90s and 80s music that I love! Lol"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best sushi joints. I'm sorry it WAS The best. I usually come in on a weeknight after working for a hours tending my beet farm after working in a mid size paper company. I come in, sit down order a water with lemon, get a crazy roll and finished with a miso soup.  However this was not the case when I came to the place again. My server was utterly rude, inconsiderate and does not represent the values what this prestigious restaurant was in the past. Much like my co worker Jim, this server constantly undermined my manners and when I ordered green tea ice cream, it was wasabi. I am also allergic to wasabi. To think the cruel, inhumane and obscene act that was performed upon my mastication of the wasabi was entertainment for this server is unbearably disgusting and filthy.  I will not be returning to this establishment if you would call it that and will be going to Poor Richard's instead for drinks and Chili's for baby back ribs."}
{"text":"After reading some rave reviews on Yelp and sampling some other not so good sushi bars in the area (Kabuki & Ah-So) I decided to take a nice drive down to Tokyo Lobby.  I was AMAZED!  Finally a traditional authentic Japanese sushi bar!    With nice heaping pieces of (melt in your mouth) sushi on small pieces of fresh sushi rice glued together by fresh wasabi (a detail i did not see at the other two bars) I was immediately wooed!  Followed by a shrimp asparagus roll and some decent sake to start off with I was in beginning to see the light.   Then came the shrimp shumai which brought me back to the days in chinatown when my great grandmother used to take us to the Emperor's Palace in the deep heart of California.  I must admit the shumai was small and I was expecting something a bit more traditional dim-sum like nice big pieces but beware, the small pieces packed big flavor and brought me back to my childhood and great memories of my great grandmother regardless of size.  After having the usual yellowtail, salmon, and tuna, we opted for some snapper.  The snapper was absolutely on point, a little stiff at the first bite but then slowly melt in your mouth after that.  Then while sitting at the bar as soon as my first round of sake was done the waitress was soon to come around and ask me for another which i pleasantly replied for the higher end original plum wine sake, so sweet and a great balance for my heavy wasabi intake.  While sitting at the bar and feeling very good courtesy of my plum wine sake I couldn't help eyeing a mouthwatering piece of fresh fish. The chef noticed me eyeing that delicious piece of filet and overheard me asking my dad what it was, he kindly butted in and told me it was albacore, I said can you get us an order of that??  He proceeded to cut up two slices of albacore and handed it over the bar.  I was smitten, this was a fish I have never tried at sushi joint before and after that one bite, I am sure to add it to the regular orders. So sweet and so soft, but still managed to maintain it's firm qualities. A contradictory of course, but what would the Japanese be without contradictions?!  A delicate balance I would rather call it.  After a beautiful appetizer and entree my father and I were ready to tackle dessert.  A gorgeous Dragon Roll lay before us; a 69 roll but instead of crab inside it's shrimp tempura, and if I said the nigiri sushi was melt in your mouth, this was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH!!  Decadently followed by freshwater eel by itself....this was truly a night to remember!  So to summarize - great sushi and excellent service.  Authentic Japanese sushi and did I mention the price??  The best value for your money guaranteed!  If you love sushi you will not leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"The BEST sushi in Phoenix! We have tried over 12 sushi places and this is our favorite. We drive over 30 minutes just to eat lunch here on the weekends. We live across from a popular sushi place but it pales in comparison to this place.   I highly recommend their 'Marilyn Mon-Roll' which is both unique and delicious. We order it every time. Their happy hour specials are also great!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews for this sushi place I was so excited to go. We went there late in the evening, about an hour before close and service was prompt and friendly enough. I was unimpressed with the sushi itself though. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad. I am a purest when it come to ordering the nagiri pieces. If I order salmon or octopus I prefer they not come with wasabi and sauces on it already because I really do enjoy the taste of the fish. The rolls I got were good and my husband who doesn't eat sushi got the beef udon.  Just as we were finishing up this small group came in about 20 minutes to close and the (I assume)manager turned them away telling them they were closing soon and didn't want to have to stay late. After they argued and promised to be quick they were given a seat in the corner and then harassed about any request they had. I was so shocked by the way they treated these people and so unimpressed by their sushi I can honestly say I don't think I will go back.   So I went back and put a big \"No Wasabi\" on the top of order. The fish was good quality and they only put wasabi on one of the pieces I ordered."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a couple years. I stuff myself silly. I recommend the orgasm roll. All their specialty rolls are very good and fresh. I wasn't too fond of the tofu appetizer. The miso soup is delicious. Bento lunch boxes have a lot of food too. I've heard that the chicken is dry but the beef isn't that bad, just a little dry.  They have a pretty good happy hour from 11 - 3 as well...they switch up what's on the happy hour menu every week or two which helps with the variety."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi here, with consistent quality and service.  They do tend to put cream cheese in many of their specialty rolls, which can be off-putting.  All day happy hour is a great idea, but you do have to order $10 in food to qualify for the $5 sake bomber special.  I believe the other drinks on special have similar requirements.  Their regular menu prices are pretty reasonable, though.  We visit this place once a month or so, and I think it would be a great place for a first time sushi eater, or one that is scared of raw options (they have many fully cooked rolls).  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Se-pe-cee-altee Loll-suh (Specialty Rolls). I can just hear my Korean parents saying this and commenting that is not real sushi.   Tokyo Lobby has various specialty rolls that will blow your mind! Besides the usual Philly, Las Vegas, rainbow, and caterpillar roll, they have several additional unique rolls. They have a Marilyn Mon roll that has Spicy tuna wrapped w/ albacore and tempura onion, ichi roll that has tempura on shrimp tempura, and fiesta salmon roll with Spicy salmon w/ jalapeno on spicy crab, extra spicy. These are just a few yummy rolls that I have tried.   I also had to have my hamachi (yellowtail) fix and ordered a sashimi plate of hamachi and it was absolutely delightful. Tokyo Lobby is one of the better sushi restaurants in AZ. I miss fresh sushi and find it difficult to for great sushi in AZ but Tokyo Lobby did not disappoint me."}
{"text":"Just had another fantastic sushi dinner at Tokyo lobby! Just super fresh and delicious everytime we go!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Best sushi around and I eat here all the time.  Be sure to try the Hawaiian roll!  Everything was prepared excellent and the service was spectacular!!!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the poorest excuse for sushi! We happened to be on this side of town and by the other reviews and it being rated 4 stars we thought it was a safe choice.....I was wrong!!! I eat sushi because I like raw FRESH fish. I do not like rolls with deep fried fish, with imitation or fake substitute ingredients, and garnished with 2 oz of spicy mayo. They do not have more than 3 or 4 rolls that don't have some sort of tempura, deep fried, or \"krab\" mix. So the food alone will be reason enough for me to never go back. The service mirrored the food. We had to ask for everything (ex. Ginger, wasabi, soy sauce, refills, check) It got to the point where we felt like we couldn't bother or ask them for anything else. For the price we were charged I could have had sushi at a 5 star restaurant. Being an ex bartender/server I couldn't not tip, but was very hard to tip. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"For several weeks my wife had been eyeing this place as we made trips to the near by Walmart.  On a whim one evening we decided to stop by and grab a treat.  Upon entering we were kindly greeted and then seated.  Using my normal test, I ordered the yellow tail, salmon, albacore and mackerel; we also ordered a few rolls just to round out the meal.  After a short wait, our food was served.  Upon my first bite into the mackerel, I was instantly transported home.  Tasting the mackerel my mom used to make, rich and full of umami without being overpowering, and a great balance  no fillers, just pure mouth watering fish.  For the first time in months I had be taken back by food.  I actually spent the time to savor that order, so I could enjoy every second of it.  The rest of the fish was all very good, had a great taste, and very tender.  The albacore and yellow tail were especially impressive, both had a creamy light flavor that speaks volumes on the quality of fish.  The portions were also great for the price, I was completely satisfied by what I was given.  The next trip we take to Walmart, we will surely stop by again."}
{"text":"SooooO my kids and I decided to come here after 2 hours of trampoline fun....and boy of boy, I must thank yelp for taking us here as it was the closest place that had sushi and awesome teriyaki chicken (based on reviews).   -water was on tap -great atmosphere -SUPER FAST (we were in and out of there in 25 minutes)   1 star deducted as the indoor seating was rather small and crowded."}
{"text":"Tried Tokyo Lobby last night - the rolls were good - the service was HORRIBLE.  The manager was very rude and the waitress forgot to deliver the appetizer.  The Sushi Chef (KC) was great though.    I'd always recommend our favorites for Sushi - Tomo and Nakama really can't compare to any west side Sushi spot  - and we've been too many places.    Sorry Tokyo Lobby - we won't be back."}
{"text":"Tokyo Lobby, after reading some good reviews about this place and some good words of our friends, so me and my family we decide to have dinner here one night 7-16-2011.  We ordered the Kyoto (two people) for me and my husband and our daughter's meal was grilled white fish.  For the drink we had hot tea, Japanese beer, and cup of water.  We don't know why people raving about this place so much.  The fish wasn't fresh and the sushi rice was too mushy above all the Mexican waiter was rude.  We feel like he never had the food here nor experience fresh fishes.  We ask him about the fresh fishes of the day, he told us everything's fresh in cocky way.  We don't know what he's smoking.  The sashimi we had wasn't fresh at all. To us sashimi has to be super fresh raw fishes not couple day old fishes, and the cut of sashimi has to be thinly slices and presentations must be superb.  The presentation of the foods was awful just like the painter don't know how to paint:  \"Chef it isn't necessary to put plastic decorations in the boat if it's not edible.  It looks very shabby.\"   Also this is a restaurant, why was music play so loud like a night club? This place really let us down.  What a waste of time and money coming to this place? We paid our bill and leave with our stomach empty.  Luckily, we drove down the road and saw Fresh Wasabi, so we stop there and try their food.  For the bad night we had at Tokyo Lobby, Fresh Wasabi make up for it.  The food was great and the waitress was outstanding & knowledgeable of her work.  We would definitely check out this place again. Who would have thoughts going out for dinner has to be two restaurants in one night?"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Quick, cheap, and good. Beef teriyaki is fabulous and the salad dressing is great."}
{"text":"Ever since I received severe food poisoning from Kyoto Bowl sushi I never wanted to eat the stuff again. (Yes, it was a Kyoto Bowl, I know that now. Leave me alone, I was 14!!)   I was introduced to Tokyo Lobby many moons ago by a good friend when I was 18 and working in retail. Tokyo Lobby was still located in the strip mall next to the Wal-Mart and the restaurant was the size of my bedroom. My first taste of Heaven on earth was the Glendale roll! Sweet, sweet sushi! I just couldn't get enough!  The prices were so reasonable and the food quality so well done this was my new favorite place! Any excuse to go here was all I needed!   Then I heard that they were moving! My heart started to drop; was I going to have to say goodbye to my favorite hidden gem? NO! They moved across the parking lot to a bigger better place! Tokyo Lobby is even more amazing now.   Reasons I am giving Tokyo Lobby 5 Stars:  1. I have NEVER gotten sick from the sushi.  2. The prices are AMAZING (I do think they raised them a bit in the past couple of months, but who can blame them?)  3. The new place has more room, a bigger sushi bar and an outdoor patio!  4. The service has ALWAYS, ALWAYS been top notch.  5. They have a yummy Sake selection!"}
{"text":"Service here has changed, the past two times I've been its been a bad experience sad to say.   Today they charged me 3.90 for a tea? What ??? Crazy expensive !  They also cleared my table away as soon as I had the last bite, then handed me the check we were there for less than thirty minutes. Normally I wouldn't mind but my husband and I were having a date night and I felt very uncomfortable like we couldn't linger and talk. Also my roll was tiny and had very little fish.  Last time I came I asked for a cucumber wrapped roll and they charged me an additional 3 dollars.   I'm irritated we won't be back"}
{"text":"Baby Lobster, Las Vegas Roll and Glendale Roll are amazing and the best I have ever had. If you want sushi, this is the place to get it!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Most tasty, well priced sushi in AZ. Plus, happy hour practically all day. The servers are attentive and all work together to make sure your drinks stay full and your bellies get stuffed with deliciousness. My boyfriend and I usually each get a roll, beers, and dessert for under $30. The Glendale and Mexican rolls are my personal fav but everything is great!"}
{"text":"I love to come here for their sushi and happy hour.  I especially enjoy their scorpion roll but so far all their sushi is good. The service seems to vary on our visits but otherwise its definitely our favorite stop for sushi."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good sushi bar and this place popped up. Boy am I glad it did too. Nice cozy place, service was excellent, sushi was amazing, I could not believe how FAST they were! I was actually a little nervous because I didn't think it could be fresh coming out that fast but it was delicious. Also how do you beat 5 dollar sake bombers! thanks Tokyo Lobby, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"You would be hard pressed to tell me there is another Sushi bar in the whole valley that is better than this place! The prices and quality speak for themselves. THEE BEST Las Vegas roll known to man! It will become your favorite Sushi bar after one try! Considering I forgot to check in many times I should have about 10-15 already! :)"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Tokyo Lobby and even tried it once several years ago, only to be unimpressed.  Stopped in again tonight with my daughter and our socks were blown off!  Outstanding rolls were the Aloha, Alaska, Scorpian (spelled according to their menu) and finished it off with the chef's recommendation of the Lolly-Pop roll.  Incredible - to the eyes just as much as to the taste buds.  We both had to force ourselves to stop as our stomachs were certainly enjoying the amazing flavors passing (yes, I realize stomachs don't \"taste\", but I already referenced taste buds in this paragraph and had to use something).    A bonus was the Blue Fin tuna.   Charlie never knew it could be like this!  We're going back.  Often I presume, and I strongly recommend you do as well."}
{"text":"Kind of a cool joint in an unexpected place.  The appetizers were GREAT! The monkey brains in particular were memorable. The sushi was decent, nothing to write home about, as were the other main dishes.  The service was good. We came with a party of about 12 and they accommodated us right away for an early dinner. When all our rolls came out, it was rather confusing, but everyone eventually got their food.  I would love to come back next time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is very good! The waitresses were very friendly.  The reason of taking 2 stars off was that the Asian man (hope he is not owner). He asked us whether we are ready to go while we were enjoying the dinner.  He put the check without saying anything. We felt we were NOT welcomed & rushed to get out!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite go to for west valley sushi but repeat visits have disappointed.  Last week when I arrived with a guest the place was about 25% full and we were told to sit at the small table which is reasonable but I knew we wanted to split the sushi boat ( big wooden boat with sushi and sashimi) which does not fit well in the small tables.  I asked to be seated at a larger table and told they were all taken for reservations.  After I explained why I wanted to sit at one the attitude changed to now allowing me to occupy the table.  Since he was sooooo concerned about loosing business to larger parties we just sat at the small table.  No one ever occupied the large (4 seat tables) while we finished our $90 meal.  I'm pretty easy going but I wont be back based on the attitude of the owner."}
{"text":"Tokyo Lobby serves up the highest quality sushi in this immediate area. I can't eat poor or mediocre sushi and can taste the difference. Since my favorite sushi place changed hands I haven't found edible tuna in the immediate area until my return to Tokyo Lobby. For $2.00 you can order real wasabi sauce here and you can request the Fish Collar that they call Jaw here. I did find that the service was a little hit and miss as the one server never gave me my wasabi but I was able to get it from the other server and in the end I left very happy.  Best sushi in the immediate area that I know of."}
{"text":"I've been trying to eat here for months but only end up getting there on a Sunday which sucks because they are closed on sunday!  Either way I got to go yesterday and it really lived up to the hype!  Playboy roll 1st off is amazing, the freshness and quality is something I've never experienced in the \"avenues\" ironically good food is usually found in the \"streets\" ( that's funny to me) but really food was great from the rolls to the miso soup all great.  Another plus is the price which is low for the high quality food you get, this is def in my top 3 sushi places.  Only complaint was the creepy waiter who stood behind us the whole time and wouldn't speak to me he handed both waters to my girlfriend as well as was unable to answer questions about rolls and stuff but was with her which is just odd, food was amazing service needs some work :)"}
{"text":"Went in for Lunch and was blown away at the speed I received my sushi, too bad I wasn't on a timetable because I would have been on time.  The food was good and there was a good size crowd for lunch.  Will return for another lunch run."}
{"text":"This a great little sushi bar. Good happy hour and good food. I like to get a sake bomber and some rolls. The Udon  is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I guess I go for convenience since its close by.  It's an OK place but I had better.  Service is good and the product is like I said OK.  I've had Mr. Sushi on Black Canyon HWY which is better."}
{"text":"I am a sushi fanatic. I could eat it everyday if I could afford it. It does get expensive. With that said, I have to say that Tokyo Lobby is the best sushi restaurant I have been to. The prices are very fair for sushi. You can go to the VERY expensive places in Scottsdale, spend twice as much, and not get better sushi. I have eaten here more times than I can count and would recommend it to any sushi lover."}
{"text":"The worst customer service on top of mediocre sushi and awful service.  There was a disgusting long black hair I pulled out of my mouth and the manager refuses to do anything about it.  He said \"it fell from the air\".  Neither person at my table at black hair.  The manager was unprofessional and refused to take responsibility for his servers.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is by far the very best sushi in the state! No one does it better and with better flavor anywhere. The couple that owns this restaurant has been doing traditional sushi and Japanese food for a very long time. The specialty rolls are to die for.   Their Albacore is the very best. My favorite roll is the Beauty Roll! It has Albacore, Cucumber in the best Sticky rice you will ever put in your mouth. Try the seaweed salad and squid salad for the best appetizers ever! They also have a killer drink special that has a bottle of hot saki and two large bottles of Kirin Beer. The Sashimi is fresh and you know from the time you enter the door the fish is fresh. They also have a great selection of traditional Japanese food.   I have brought people from Chandler to eat here and now when they want good sushi they make the trip."}
{"text":"great sushi, reasonably priced, and they also offer other entrees as well.  try the grilled whitefish or the teryaki salmon!  One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for lunch.  The staff was friendly and attentive. We had mostly sashimi. Everything was fresh and very well prepared.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving Tokyo Lobby one star because they don't have an option for no stars.. This has been the worst experience I've ever had as far as service. The waitress' waiters and management seem to be in the WORST mood ever and they seem to just not want to deal with anyone. I asked a question about a type of sushi only to have the manager or owner walk away from my table without saying anything to me in response. I am severely disappointed in this place as I have been looking forward to coming here for awhile and I will never come back. Also if you like to watch sports don't come here they don't have any at all.."}
{"text":"Love me some Tokyo Lobby!    I've going here for the last two years and its the best.  I didn't want to write a review because I don't want everyone to come and leave me without a seat! :)    But alas, I must share. I love the staff and the rolls are AWESOME! My favorite is the Mexican roll - quite delicious. There has not been a Specialty roll on this menu that I haven't taken a liking to, they taste fresh and the presentation is always on point.    The staff is friendly, quick service and great deals.  The lunch specials deliver a great meal at a great price. The best part about this place is the music!! They love the 80's in here and so I when I'm there, bring it on Billy Idol and Boy George!     I could totally see Glenn taking Julia (from the Wedding Singer) to show off his exotic taste! :)  Its picture perfect."}
{"text":"This place is great whether you like sushi or not. I am not a fish eater, but my boyfriend is. I always order their chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of it is always excellent. My boyfriend orders the California roll (either regular or tempura coated), the spicy tuna roll, and many others. He says it's very good as well. The service is always great and the atmosphere is nice. It's a small place, maybe 15 tables plus the sushi bar. It's not fancy, but it's a nice weekly dining experience that's affordable and great food. Be advised though, they do close from 3-5pm to prepare for dinner service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places. I have been coming here for almost 5 years with friends, my bf, and occasionally, just me.   It's small and cozy on the inside. It's on Bell Road but faces away from the street, in front of Wal Mart.   They offer happy hour during lunch, which is aweome. The rolls featured rotate every so often, and it's always generous choices.   I get miso soup or squid salad with a side of sriracha sometimes, and always sushi rolls. My favorites are the Mexican (crab with sushi shrimp), Philly, spicy crab, Vegas (deep fried goodness) and Yummy roll. (it is!!!) I also get the monkey brains appetizer on occasion. Not the healthiest but its delicious. The rolls are always fresh tasting and they have amazing sauces.   I was with friends once who ordered teriyaki chicken, and that is also delicious for the non sushi people out there.  The owner is often there and always says hello.  I love their iced green tea (as you read my reviews, you'll understand I'm really big on tea). It has to be the quality stuff. So refreshing! Hot green tea is really good, too.  Oh, and they have mochi for dessert! What are you waiting for? Go to Tokyo Lobby!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. The place NEEDS to get bigger, coming here on a Friday or Saturday night is out of the question!!!!!!! Also, more rolls with fruit would be nice... like some kiwi and mango.... the one with tuna and pineapple SO GOOD. :)"}
{"text":"Sake bombers for 5 bucks.  5 stars.  Rainbow Roll..decent...  Dragon roll...yuck...Spider Roll ewww.    I've been here several times, trying to like it because of the reviews.  But each time the sushi just sucked for me.  It tasted fishy. And fresh fish actually doesn't taste like fish. Go figure.  And the sweet cinnamony sauce tasted absolutely wretched on the sushi."}
{"text":"Descent lunch hour. Bento boxes offer the most food from the items on the lunch menu but if I were to go here again, I would have just ordered rolls from the happy hour menu. Friend ordered the beef teriyaki which was pretty boring and didn't have any vegetables. Descent option for a quick lunch. I hear Sakana is a better option for lunch."}
{"text":"Just ate here for first time tonight and it was amazing! I have been so homesick for the food back home in Hawaii , been here a month, cured my sickness. The service is great! The pork cutlet delicious, agedashi tofu amazing, gyoza delicious, Poke was huge - so much salad with it, Tuna Roll big and thick, Tuna Nigiri generous size fish, salmon roll huge, heart attack roll amazing, miso delicious, all around HUGE servings, waitress and all staff very attentive."}
{"text":"OKAY. It's official. I went here for lunch yesterday to give this place another try. I don't like to completely write off a place unless I get extremely bad service, but never again Tokyo Lobby! I must be living in crazy town or have the best luck ever going on the two crappiest days for Tokyo Lobby. I'm seriously not understanding what there is to like here.   I ordered a few rolls, one of them were so big in diameter I thought it was a frisbee (not very conducive for dipping or eating for that matter since one bite made everything fall apart) and the sauces on the rolls were way too sweet...I thought maybe they were glazed with candy. And probably the worst roll was one that had too much cream cheese in it! The salmon to cream cheese ratio was out of control! I literally bit into a chunk of cream cheese. I had to drown everything out with wasabi because the water I had tasted weird too. The sad part is I couldn't even finish the meal, not because I was full but because I didn't want to.   The meal was also very overpriced, especially for the quality of food. It's not like I blindly ordered without knowing what I was going to have to pay, but I don't mind paying a bit more for good food -  however this was the nail in the coffin. $45 for a subpar lunch for two people? They can have my money for the last time."}
{"text":"Great place to eat sushi. Always a good experience and friendly staff!  Sushi is fresh and great selection not to mention the good happy hour every day!  Give them a try you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Me and some friends had to try this place out because we heard that it's the best sushi in town... When we came in it looked pretty nice and the staff was very friendly. I ordered just a basic California roll and it was surprisingly amazing, and I'm pretty sure my friends enjoyed their food as well. Everything I heard about this place was correct and it really is that good, 5/5!"}
{"text":"Consistantly delicious! Have been going to this joint since it was actually in the now renovated WalMart section of this corner. Can not go in without having at least one vegas roll. Their rainbow roll is also a classic and fresh staple. Their Glendale roll is amazing as well!  The cucumber salad is a nice starter. Although it ain't as good as it used to be their miso soup is still pretty darn good! Great sake/beer specials! They also have special rolls for the day; a great place to go have your favorites or try something new!"}
{"text":"Huge fan!  I have been here multiple times.  It is a tad on the pricey side, but much better in quality than Kabuki.   They have a pretty solid Happy Hour menu on their roles.   I am a huge fan of their Vegas Roll, yet to find another place make it anywhere near as well.  They have 2 different outdoor patio's available as well.  My favorite sushi place for sure."}
{"text":"When for lunch with kids.  Ordered some Sushi and several rolls (Spider Roll, Beauty Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll and Spicy Tuna).  Miso soup was watery.  Sushi rice had a strong vinegar after taste.  Service was good.  Overall, a little pricey for average Sushi."}
{"text":"Craving some sushi, I got a chance to go to Tokyo Lobby for the first time the other night.  After reading a few of my fellow Yelper's reviews on this place I was excited to find good sushi and sashimi on the West Side ~ in Glendale of all places!  To my amazement and bewilderment Tokyo Lobby serves some of the freshest and most delicious sushi I've had in the Phoenix metro including Scottsdale!  Wowsers! Why did it take me so long to find this place? Well it's a tiny place joined to a shoe store located in front of the \"super-duper-take-your-money-and-run-Walmart-center\" at 57th & Bell.  Since I hate shopping at \"wally world\" I have been driving past them for months not knowing about this little gem of a sushi restaurant.   I sat at the sushi bar where I could have a better view of the sushi maestro Kelvin Kim create the most wonderful sushi concoctions. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated with Asian art and a few TV's to watch the games. The sushi bar is the main attraction with Chef Kim and another sushi master working their magic.  The service was top notch, very accommodating and eager to please their customers.  Food: Started with Hamachi Belly sashimi ~ very tasty, sweetest tasting tuna ever.  I ordered some fresh wasabi and ponzu sauce to go with my sushi rolls. I ordered the \"what the heck\" ~ nice punch of heat with great texture from the tuna and jalape√±os and the Chicago roll ~ great blend of spicy crab/scallops with salmon.  Both were unique and outstanding!  Topped it all with a $5 sake bomb special ~ large Ichiban beer with hot sake.  \"make it a double sake bomb pleeeeaaasseee!\"   Huge THANKS to my fellow Yelper's for recommending this little sushi gem! I am looking forward to my next visit and trying another one of Chef Kim's sushi creations. I recommend you try Tokyo Lobby next time your craving for sushi and hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Liked this place so much the first time I came for dinner on a second day in a row. It seems like it's always very dark inside, but in case you want more light they are 2 patios outside. On my first dinner I ordered from the Happy Hour menu, all of the items on which looked great. The second day I got one of the bento boxes, which turned out to be a lot of food but it was so delicious I was able to finish it all. The only issue I could see someone having with this place is the fact that it's fairly dark inside, but I personally didn't have a problem with it, it'd probably be a nice place to bring someone on a date, as I saw a decent amount of couples there when I went for dinner on both days. I will definitely come back when I return to Phoenix in the future."}
{"text":"Very good sushi place. Staff is polite and attentive i always have s great experience when I come here, the food on the other hand is delicious !!!! They have a variety of options you can choose from that vary in cooked and raw."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to try the food, the waitress was so rude from the minute we walked in.  After we ordered our drinks she was still being rude so we decided to leave. It wasn't just us who walked out either, there was a couple who came in right after us who left too!"}
{"text":"Very nice lunch.  Tempura udon was very flavorful and tempura nice and crisp.  Was made to order so a bit of a wait.  Wife had a sushi combo which was also very nice will try again in evening.  Looks like most help is Japanese"}
{"text":"Solid sushi great happy hour pricing. The service sometimes can appear like they are angry at the guest for some reason or another all and all quality food keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Definitely will visit again. The service and the rolls were excellent. I've been to a few different sushi restaurants and this one is by far the best one."}
{"text":"I feel awkward giving this restrauant the lowest score it's received but I came here based on Yelp! reviews.  The rolls were all specialty rolls so I went crazy and ordered 5 of them. The heart attack roll was weak and the jalepenos were not stuffed at all... The fire and volcano rolls which are supposed to be baked came out cold and tasted extremely bland... And the Mama Mia roll was somewhat decent.  It's a small place and although we got there later in the night I did not expect to be stared at to finish and feel uncomfortable with 10 minutes until close still while they turned all lights off.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about when they criticize the staff for being rude or the food for being 'bland' or 'tasteless.' I have been to this little sushi place twice and I've experienced nothing negative. In fact, I found the staff quite friendly and welcoming. The sushi chefs stop to enthusiastically greet each customer who walks through the door. Waitresses promptly seat you and take your drink order. I do find it a little weird that they only provide one menu per table, which might be logistically challenging if you have a large group of people. Maybe in that case they bring you two. So far that hasn't been an issue for me since I tend to order from the sushi menu a la carte.   I found the sushi itself to be pretty darned good; not stellar, but pretty tasty. If I were to rate just the quality of the food, I'd give it a solid 7. They have a fairly decent assortment of specialty rolls, which is what I like in a sushi place. I prefer variety and creativity, over the norm. I hate sitting down to sushi only to find the menu selections to be the standard caterpillar, California and dragon rolls. Boooooooor-ing!   To sum up my experience... The sushi was well prepared, tasty and fresh. The staff was friendly and the food came out quickly. Prices are moderate. Overall, I'm happy!   So, would I recommend this place? Absolutely! Will I come back? You betcha! Just save me a seat."}
{"text":"Tokyo lobby is an overall good choice. The fish is fresh and basically nothing else on the menu has every disappointed me.   Having said that there are some things that I'm gonna complain about.....I can't give it 5 stars because 1. Service blows- If you're planning on having dinner there on the weekend, don't. I swear they have maybe two waitresses who are running around all over the place. They need to hire more people. 2. It's expensive- I like to get sashimi and the prices are outrageous.   I guess I'll give them some compliments since I just tore them a new a-hole. Go for lunch-it's way worth it. The lunch menu is cheap and really good, there aren't too many people there so the service is good and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"I'm relatively new to sushi and I felt that this was a very welcoming environment for newcomers. My favorites, avocado and California rolls, were amazing and the new ones I tried, Las Vegas and Sex-on-the-beach were delicious. So glad I came here!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!!! Great service and food. Have been here numerous times and never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent food. ..great price. .. specially during happy hour after 8:pm.   The Mexican roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"We went here last night, and it was absolutely amazing. We thought we would try a new place and we are glad we did! The sushi was amazing! The service was awesome! They were so attentive but not over top so that you were annoyed. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"My favorite here is Alaskan roll and Boston roll. Service is great every time, never have to remind them for something you asked. They never messed up on our orders. Always on point. We been here over 20 times in the past 10 years. I would highly recommend this place. Just don't go on Saturdays nights lol that's our day and we always go with a party 8+. Kidding."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food. Great happy hour. It is my top pick for sushi!"}
{"text":"For a NYC guy visiting Phoenix for the first time, i gotta say i was imressed. Try the unagi or spicy tuna. Both are excellent."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi joints I have been a patron of.  Very crowded, noisy, rushed, and the sushi just isn't that good... bland, nothing special, doesn't even look good. No Wow factor here.  on top of that, it's not a cheap spot to go to. $$-$$$ based on your mood. Stay away from Phili rolls here."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for sushi in the west valley and with never ending happy hour, I make the trip often. So good!"}
{"text":"Tokyo lobby is just OK.  We went around 8pm on a Saturday, there was no wait, but it was close to full. The portion sizes are good and they have some interesting rolls that I'd never seen before, like the \"what the heck\" roll, which is pretty spicy and pretty good.  I am a seaweed salad junkie. Unfortunately here its lacking, the seaweed was really hard and tough, instead of a crisp/squishy texture that it usually has. It was really disappointing because I think its a pretty hard thing to mess up. I also got a spicy tuna roll, which was not good. It tasted like nothing. Not spicy, or any other flavor at all. It was really weird and I ended up just not eating it which is UNHEARD of when it comes to me and sushi.  I think that my boyfriend would probably come back here because their nigiri and specialty rolls are pretty good, but I need my seaweed salad fix when I get sushi, so I don't think I'll be going back. The prices are what I consider average."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance, since it's a little out of my usual stomping grounds. We stopped in for lunch, and I'm a little bit in love with the place. It's kind of dark inside, with a classic rock station on the radio. It's family friendly. The next table over was a man and three kids, and they greeted some apparent regulars by name when they came in, so is the kind of atmosphere I love.  We ordered bento boxes and they were HUGE. We probably didn't eat half the food. I had the chicken, but I'll admit that I liked my roommate's steak better. Everything was tasty and seemed fresh.  Bottom line: 10/10, would nom it again."}
{"text":"Tonight was the third time I have gone there and have to say third time was the charm...Love this place.  Great service, food, timely service and nice atmosphere a big win!!!  All though it is a little small and you may need to wait...but if that is the case and you are flexible they do to go orders and take reservations.  Happy hour offers some great deals for you."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Personally, I feel like they're slipping. They use mayo in their crab mix and their spicy tuna. Their fish doesn't seem as fresh as it used to be, and the owner just doesn't seem like a people person. The waitresses and chefs are very kind but the owner tends to be impatient. Every time I eat here now I get a weird itch in my throat and I can't tell if it's all the mayo they use or their fish. Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  Not amazing, but solid.  Its actually owned by a Korean family and not a Japanese family - and you'll notice it in the details but overall we had a good experience here.   We ordered a lot of things which ranged in flavor and quality.  Here is the skinny... Rice:fish ratio (sushi only) - perfect Fish quality - ok to excellent; salmon and yellowtail were ok - yellowtail belly, large scallops and  mirugai were excellent.   Rolls were ok  - we had two specialty rolls; most of them come as \"spicy\" which I personally don't enjoy.  Tempura veggies:  excellent.  The service was great.  The restaurant was clean...will most likely become our new neighborhood sushi joint.  Glad to have found this place with the help of my fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"this is by far my favorite sushi place here in the valley! i would usually come here after work and the staff is so friendly and attentive. the service is quick and the sushi wins me over every time. highly recommend the chef specialty rolls, especially the orgasm roll! dont pass up this small sushi joint, one visit is all it took for me to be hungry for more!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big sushi fan but a close friend of mine swears by this place and so I gave it a try (I was elated that the Yelp reviews were all wonderful, as well).  I was pleasantly surprised.  I had a hot house Sake carafe- of course it did not disappoint.  We had the monkey brains to start out with as an appetizer- it was delicious.  It was a fried piece of heaven with spicy tuna and mushrooms.  They also have an appetizer called the heart attack which I will have to go back to try (jalapenos stuffed with yummy cream cheese).  I had a miso soup and the spicy tuna roll which I was quite happy with.    The service was decent, although the Lakers seemed to be quite a distraction for our server.  A great place for my first open minded sushi experience."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite sushi place... we've been to many, but the value and freshness you receive here is outstanding. Plus, it's always fast, which we love! All we order are rolls and nothing we've tried is bad."}
{"text":"The sushi here is exceptional. My friend, Mason P., and I went here for lunch today because we were in a sushi mood.  We ordered the Vegas Roll, the Hawaiian roll, and the Chicago roll. The last of which was not my favorite thing in the world because it was pretty bland. On the other hand, the Vegas and the Hawaiian rolls were both great.  One major complaint that I have... I want a straw with my beverage next time, please. Another thing, the staff is nice, but not really personable. It was pretty busy, though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place because Island Teriyaki across the street was closed. We got there and were served very quickly. As I was looking at the menu a gnat or other small bug landed on me.. Kinda freaked me out. Also,an open trash can right by the door to the back of the kitchen/cleaning area in plain view of customers, right by the sushi making area. We ordered and I got the chicken teriyaki and he got the beef teriyaki. The food came out hot and looked pretty great. Upon closer inspection I noticed my chicken just looked..off. Maybe because I'm used to white, juicy chicken at Island Teriyaki. Maybe it was the lighting? I don't know but after eating just not very impressed. Had almost no flavor, like not marinated long enough. I got siracha to put on it and some soy sauce for more flavor and I like spicy anyways. I tried my boyfriend's beef teriyaki and it just tasted much better and not overcooked and flavorless. Giving three stars for fast service and the price wasn't too expensive, $25 on a Sunday night for 2 entrees a beer and a soda.   I would rather have Island Teriyaki across the street , the spicy chicken there is phenomenal and cheaper for the same amount of portions."}
{"text":"\"I've cut a bitch for less...\"  This is the response I received from my Partner in Culinary Crime after demonstrating my mad chopstick skills to scoop up a wayward spicy scallop.   You see, the creations at Tokyo Lobby are worth fighting for.  Every last morsel.  Of course I am going to risk life and limb!!   :)  Before moving AZ, I was told by friends who were familiar with my sushi-loving ways that I had to try Tokyo Lobby.  Nearly two years later, it was finally time to take their advice - we headed west into the uncharted territory of... Glendale!  That first visit was spectacular, and since then we have been back multiple times for both lunch and dinner.  Sometimes twice in the same week - it is really that good.   We have tried a variety of items, but so far the favorites are:  - Hamachi Toro - yellowtail belly sashimi - Spicy Scallops - Chicago Roll - salmon on spicy crab and scallops - What the Heck Roll - I can only describe this as spicy tuna heaven, with some jalapeno tossed in just because it is fun...  Try any and all of these with their fresh wasabi and citrus-infused ponzu.  Amazing!!  Top this off with a large beer (Ichiban, please!) and hot sake for only $5.  From the fresh and perfectly prepared fish to the friendly and attentive owners and staff, a visit to Tokyo Lobby is really a pleasure.  If Glendale is not what immediately comes to mind when you think of sushi, it will be soon!    Tanoshinde!!"}
{"text":"Okay, we've been here several times, our first experience was great, great service and great sushi. We love coming here. A couple of weeks ago, my husband and I went there alone without our kids, date night. The waiter was a little rude about how much sushi we were ordering. You know date night goes, we like to splurge a little when it comes to food. So, we order a couple of different types of sushi rolls, some we haven't tried. And he was surprised on how much we were eating. We aren't overweight or anything. We just wanted to try different types of rolls. It would be a little nice to not be judged on the amount of food that is being ordered. And we felt like we were being rushed. Don't get me wrong it is a small restaurant. But if you're paying for a meal it would be nice to at least enjoy without being rushed. This is the only problem I've had with this place. So, enough about that. They have $5 sake bombers during happy hour, which is awesome but not really a fan of Kirin. I wish they had Sapporo. Again, the sushi is great. I will definitely come back, but hope to have a better experience like I did the first time."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came in for dinner, we ordered the Kyoto boat, it was wonderful, very fresh sushi beautifully arranged. We also ordered seaweed salad and potato croquettes. Everything was delicious. Our server was friendly and attentive, Tokyo Lobby will definitely be one of our favorite places for sushi!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I first tried Tokyo Lobby, so I will do my best to remember the highlights. It's a bit out of my way so I've only yet to go one time. But I could only take so much nagging and prodding and pushing from my coworker who kept whining \"I want Tokyo Lobby!\" until I finally said \"OK SHUT UP WE ARE GOING THIS INSTANT\"  The thing that stood out the most was the friendly staff. When my friends and I walked in, the employees all greeted us with a friendly shout. Suddenly I'm Norm from \"Cheers\"  The sushi was excellent! I'm still kind of a sushi noob, but as a person who doesn't really care for fish I have to say it was quite impressive. The texture was just right; not too chewy and not too squishy.  I believe what I had was called a Glendale Roll. Baby lobster and... stuff, rolled up, battered and fried to a crisp. Delicious! Nothing like good sushi cooked to order! (Yes, it's ironic on purpose) I think all food should be battered and fried. If you see a restaurant in the future called The Battery, then odds are I'll be running the place.  At the time of my last visit, there was a new location being built closer to the road on the opposite end of the parking lot. I'm assuming this is to accomodate more customers as Tokyo Lobby was teeny tiny inside. Maybe it's to further distance the restaurant from the WalMart a few doors down. I say good on you, Tokyo Lobby. WalMart sucks. As of right now I don't know if it's open yet, but hopefully it will be soon. Excellent place, and I would recommend it to anyone with an appetite for sushi.  Edit! I asked my coworker today about the status of the new building and he says it's open! I like exclamation points!"}
{"text":"My first time here and as I'm sitting in my seat inside I was thinking how I was going to love this place. But I didn't. Granted I came in 45 min before they close I instantly felt not welcomed. Then the prices sucked. I thought it was happy hour. Then the food came but the food sucked yen is way better my dragon roll look like a snail world. Then to top it off they took forever to give us our tab. While I was waiting for my tab I got the pleasure of sharing my f****** drink with a flying visitor then finally my tab came only to go over it and realize that because we ordered a side of rice and a roll the sake bomber was $10 because the rice didn't amount to $10 of food so the happy hour special is only if you order $10 of food per person to get a $5 sake bomber needless to say this is probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had in about a good ten years I love sushi but I don't love Tokyo Lobby!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Place was very clean with extremely good service!!!!  Fresh fish and great quality.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Best udon noodles ever, also very good sushi but I go there mostly for the tempura udon. Good staff, good quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"I love this little place!  Everyone is always so friendly. Fast service, too. My advice is to stick to the nigiri/sashimi, or look for single-ingredient rolls. The Philly roll is good, too. Most of the specialty rolls are drowned in spicy mayo or Sriracha, and the taste of the fish is overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Lali J. and I took a road trip to Tokyo Lobby last night. We'd heard about it through excellent reviews in the New Times and the Republic (a positive review in the Republic is often a neon sign that says \"stay away,\" but we decided to risk it).   As a transplanted New Yorker/San Franciscan/Los Angeleno, I have to say Tokyo Lobby has been my favorite sushi experience in the valley. If you're used to Ra or any of the other McSushi places, it's worth the schlep up to North Glendale (which is almost as far as the Yukon from where we live) to check this place out.  T.L. is a small, 10 table joint, but it's crowded in a vibrant, fun way. Service is fast and friendly. It's in a strip mall, but if you keep your eyes left of center as you approach from the parking lot, you won't see the WalMart on your right.   The usual/traditional suspects are brilliant -- stunning unagi, maguro, tobiko, etc. The sides and appetizers were fab, too: great seaweed salad and gyoza.   Tokyo Lobby is creative with the specialty rolls -- the Marilyn Mon-Roll (not kidding) was terrific: a spicy tuna roll wrapped in albacore with an elegant topping of crispy/crunchy onion.  There's also a full menu of earthbound flesh and assorted other goodies. Everything looked great. Really -- check this place out!"}
{"text":"If the outside of the building was nicer, I'd probably view this Japanese Restaurant as a a high end place.  Excellent service and even better sushi/food.  Best Japanese food in the PHX market."}
{"text":"We love coming here! This is actually our only sushi place. We love sitting at regular counter  and have gotten to know quite a few people. We actually got a plate when the owner (he was making sushi) made us something on the house. Service is great and attentive. In 5 years never had a complaint!"}
{"text":"This is our other go to place for sushi. The garlic ponzu sauce they use on the playboy and playgirl rolls is to die for. The server always remembers us and brings our usual drinks. Always a nice touch when you get personalized service. Although they don't usually have any sashimi specials, the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are very creative and delicious!"}
{"text":"I just moved from Seattle back in December and I am no slouch when it comes to Good fresh sushi. The Tokyo Lobby is all of that and more. Excellent sashimi and sushi, great bento box options that the whole family can enjoy. My family and I have been here about four times in the last six months and plan on returning again and again, as long as the quality and service continues to be top notch. I work hard for my money and I have no qualms spending it in a place like this!"}
{"text":"Been going since they moved locations. This is my buddies favorite spot to go. He's been going with his entire family since his kids where in diapers. I Love this place almost as much as another favorite of mine. I like everything but Salmon so if you're adventurous you can try pretty much anything. I had my first Tuna Sashmi here. It was excellent. Sat at the sushi bar, The Sushi Chief is great I'm old so I forget his name. Yeah I dig this place."}
{"text":"First of all, can I start with how much I adorable this place! Every time we go in everyone is so amazing, smiling, and gracious! You need something just ask, I had a friend who couldn't use chopsticks so they brought her \"training chopsticks\". They are passionate about their restaurant as well, best of all it's locally owned! You can't beat this place, they display of their sushi, their customer service, it's the whole \"enchilada\"!! Definitely one of my favorite places to have sushi around the valley!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. I got it to go, otherwise I would have sent it back. The wasabi smelled strange and the Vegas roll was mushy, cold, and stale. I only ate a couple pieces and threw the rest away. I had another roll that was supposed to have spicy tuna and tempura. It was also mushy and there was nothing spicy about. I smelled a piece and it smelled straight up funky. I love sushi but this stuff turned my stomach."}
{"text":"I've ordered sushi for pick up a few times and have eaten inside the restaurant once. Every time I've ordered sushi for pick up it's always tasted amazing. Eating inside the restaurant was not a good experience. Our waitress was unfriendly and seemed like she was in a bad mood. She almost made us feel as if we were bothering her. The sushi also didn't taste as good as it does when I order pick up. I'll give it another try but I definitely won't be eating inside anytime soon."}
{"text":"TL is a terrific Sushi restaurant. They're busy enough to ensure fresh sushi every time. We always get started with the Monkey Brains (spicy crab inside a tempura mushroom).  Seems like every time we get it the sushi chef puts a little different spin on the presentation. Always worth the price of admission. Skyler must have hit TL on an extraordinarily rare off day to pan this place. We've dined here probably 30+ times and never had a bad meal.  We're not stuck on any other roll, there are so many to pick from on the menu. We do like to sit at the bar and watch the chefs work.  We drive past quite a few sushi places to eat at Tokyo Lobby."}
{"text":"After a photoshoot in Tempe my friends and I wanted some goooood sushi. We were headed to Glendale so decided to look up some places up there. We decided on Tokyo Lobby. TL was very easy to find; you enter the plaza and its right as you drive in. There is a small parking lot for this small sushi place. They have two patio areas. On the inside, they have a small set up of tables. They definitely had enough seating areas for groups of six or more so thats a plus for big groups. You get the traditional greeting as you walk in. The service was great! They were nice and quick. The sushi prices were reasonable. They were actually proper sized bites where you don't need to take two bites to finish the whole thing.  We ordered las vegas rolls, spicy tuna, scorpion roll, california roll, shrimp tempura, musashi roll, and fresh wasabi. I enjoyed the way they made their rolls and the quantity for the price. 8 rolls for about $6. Everyday is happy hour so they have rolls starting at $4. I will definitely come back to Tokyo Lobby!"}
{"text":"Been her just once and had a good experience !"}
{"text":"I just love the food, best place in Arizona to eat sushi. The staff is so friendly and the service is great."}
{"text":"Some friends asked us here and when we arrived surprised by the location.  Don't be deceived by the location, this place has great quality sushi!  The service was good.  Certainly a place is recommend and go back to over and over again.  Our two favorite options were the Play Girl and jalapeno himachi.  Yum to both!"}
{"text":"I remember eating here years ago when they were connected to the Wal-Mart building. It was a tiny place with not much room but it was very good.   After saying a million times that I need to eat there again, my wife and I go for my birthday dinner. When we got there there wasn't much going on so we sat down right away.   Looking at the menu, I see that the large beers are $5, and then I take a look at the little sign on the table. \"Sake Bombs $5, includes large beer and sake\". SOLD! We both get one, and got WAY more sake then I thought we would, and before I could even get halfway done with my beer, our sushi arrived, it was really fast. I think we got two rolls and pot stickers.   All of the food was really good, the only thing I would change is that the roll sizes are a little large, it takes a really big bite to get a piece in. Not that I'm complaining cause I like my portions, but just a slightly smaller roll would be perfect.   Summary:   YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO SCOTTSDALE TO EAT GOOD SUSHI!! Support the north side and help the little guys out, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for here, its cheap but there is a reason.  Don't expect to be blown away, but for its price range its good."}
{"text":"Great spot for quick sushi and great service! We ordered the Scorpion roll and Sashimi boat A; both were delicious and very presentable. We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend to come here. We chose sushi from the happy hour menu. The service was very quick and the sushi was delicious. The presentation of the sushi was nice and prepared very well. They got busy quickly. Recommend for families of anyone else that loves sushi!"}
{"text":"The happy hour sake bomb special of 5 bucks is only valid if you order 10 bucks worth of food per person. So if you have two people getting two sake bombs you need to have 20 bucks of food between you for the deal, which means you'll spend 30 bucks minimum without tip. We like doing 2 sake bombs and a happy hour roll and a specialty roll."}
{"text":"Sushi did not taste fresh.  And whatever sauce they used on my not-fresh dragon roll almost made me puke.  Service was decent though.  That deserves the one star I am forced to put on here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner based on the many positive Yelp reviews and I'm sorry to say this was the worst sushi I have ever had.  The portions were TINY and the sushi was, well, fishy. It didn't taste like the high quality sushi that I was expecting.  Plus the prices were extremely high for the quality and quantity of food received.  I guess RA and Kabuki are the only decent sushi restaurants in the Phoenix metro area.  Avoid this place and go to either of those instead!"}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hour prices.  Sushi was fresh, service was fast.  Very busy place, I think the word is out about this place.  I have eaten Sushi at a lot of places here in Phoenix and this place is good."}
{"text":"Ordered our food around 5:30 yesterday. Everyone that came in behind us (even 20, 30 minutes after us) got their food before us. At one point the waitress brought one roll over out of the 6 rolls we ordered. It wasn't even ours. She came by and picked it up off of the table and took it to another table which seemed kind of gross since it was at our table for like 5-10 minutes and we could have licked it for all she knew. Finally our food starts to arrive an hour after we ordered and it was all completely incorrect, soy paper on everything when only two rolls were ordered with soy paper. At that point it wasn't worth sending back because we were starving and it took so long in the first place. They really made no attempts to make it right with us. Sushi was decent. Would never, ever return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in town. he happy hour pricing is amazing and the food is really good. My drink never gets below half empty as the servers are always on top of it.   I highly recommend the \"What the Heck\" roll. Very spicy and so good."}
{"text":"Im a big sushi fan and this past Wed we had to find a place to eat, our friend recommended Tokyo Lobby.   I've driven past it before, but never thought to eat.  The back of the building faces Bell Rd., so you dont actually see anything but the name.  When walking inside, it has the decor and feel like a small well lit sushi bar. They have a patio outside that is covered for small parties and people to hang out at.  Inside they have about 10 or so tables.  Plenty of room for anyone.  We ordered our drinks and some edemame and then it was time to order the sushi..  We tried some of the signature rolls like \"Orgasm\" and \"Monkeybrains.\"  Let me tell you... some of the best sushi I have had.  The Orgasm was so unusual, but delicious.  It had a sweet crunch to it and then just melted in your mouth.  I know that can sound a bit much.. but it was amazing.  For three people.. we ordered six rolls..Yes.. 6.   When I was done, I was literally thinking \"Umm. more please?\"  I can't wait to go back!  The service was awesome, the food was great and I had no clue this place was this good!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place. The food is always delicious and fresh! Only thing I would recommend, if you go close to opening in the evening, sit outside! They are good about the restaurant being clean but heavy on the pinesol and that ruins the experience, but sit outside and that works great, plus it's very comfy."}
{"text":"Vegas roll and crazy roll are AWESOME. Pretty small place so take that into consideration. Would love to try more on their menu!"}
{"text":"Since we have found Tokyo Lobby we have stopped going anywhere else.  Our favorites are Monkey Brains and the Playboy Roll.  The Playboy Roll is one of those rolls that you can't stop thinking about until you get it again.  It is really that good. The restaurant is small but we have never had to wait to get in.   The owner is usually there and very attentive. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I've tried a variety of their rolls and have to say the sushi is just okay. What I keep coming back for is specifically for their Glendale and Volcano rolls which are rich and flavorful.  Their bento boxes were surprisingly good sized."}
{"text":"Oh my god! I can't praise them enough! Never have I had such delicious premium sushi consistently over years. The staff and owners are friendly and quick to bring our order. The menu has grown over the years and so has the location but everything they prepare is fresh , delicious and photo worthy! Writing about it is making me hungry again!! This is a Must if you're a sushi  lover."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls and awesome happy hour deals. Try the Crazy Roll for something out of the box. Ashley is a great server!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in the valley. The selection of rolls is plentiful and always of the highest quality. The staff is welcoming and attentive. The weekend happy hour is another reason to like this place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with another couple.  I was excited to come here because this place has been on my list since I moved to Glendale.  The restaurant is located in a boring strip mall, but you would never know that by the looks on the inside.  I had the Las Vegas roll, spicy tuna roll, edamame, and miso soup.  The sushi was great like most others are saying here on yelp.  The miso soup was very delightful and had some good flavor to it.  The only reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is the fact that the edamame came out soggy and seemed to be cooked well before I ordered it.  I will definitely try this place again to see if I can bump it up a notch in my opinion.  This place should not be overlooked!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating at this restaurant in the past, but I recently ordered pick up and was disappointed. My dad asked for low sodium soy sauce several times, when I opened the bag, there was one small container of regular soy sauce....for enough food to feed three people. The dried calamari was so bland and chewy, almost as if it came from a bargain brand in the frozen section at a grocery store that was put in a microwave."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot to say about this place. Sushi was okay. They put way too much sauce on the rolls and the rolls themselves are monotone in taste. Nothing spectacular, but nothing utterly disgusting at the same time. Would I recommend this place? Probably not. There are better sushi place around the area."}
{"text":"After the first bland meal I had here I swore I would never be back. However a friend had a birthday dinner here recently and so we went back. I stayed away from the strange and flavorless veggie roll that I had last time and this time ordered the  Agedashi Tofu and Vegetable Tempura while my husband ordered Bento box chicken B. The Agedashi Tofu was another flavorless item and the ice cold sauce they provided did little to add flavor. The Vegetable Tempura was the highlight of my meal but when items that are supposed to be hot are served with ice cold sauce it ends up being a strange and unwelcome marriage. My husband's chicken teriyaki also had minimal flavor and it seemed that the teriyaki sauce had been squirted on the accompanying vegetables afterwards as apposed being added to the chicken while cooking. The spicy tuna roll was so slathered in a sauce that my husband described as tasting like thousand island dressing that they were inedible. The best thing on his plate were the spring rolls and they were clearly taken out of a package (not made at the restaurant) and fried. The service also left much to be desired. When one of our party asked a question about a menu item the (older of the working waitresses) waitress replied \"I don't know, I'm not eating it.\".. So when our checks arrived and we found that our bills had been first added together and then separated as we had originally asked so that the 18% large bill gratuity would be added to each bill I was floored. I am all for tipping big when it is deserved but this service in no way deserved this amount of gratuity. Being a friend's birthday party I just went with it but next time, party or not, I will never be dragged to this poor service and tasteless food restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome all the way around! super fresh sushi and friendly service,would go here every week if I could."}
{"text":"Always amazing. Great staff. Fun atmosphere. Rolls are well proportioned. The sushi crew is always creating new fun things to try. Recommended to a friend and his wife...they're hooked!"}
{"text":"New favorites at Tokyo Lobby:   -Volcano Roll: baked scallops with vegetables on a california roll  -Sex on the Beach: spicy crab and ahi tuna on top of a tempura banana  -Scorpion Roll: shrimp tempura, crab, tuna, whitefish and masago  -Salmon sashimi  I'm now there on a weekly basis. It's becoming a slight obsession..."}
{"text":"First off I have to say, when entering this place, I felt so welcomed!.  All the chefs and waitress stop what they are doing to say \"Hi\" to you. Almost giving you that celebrity feeling. I kept hearing great things about this place and I wanted to give it a try.  The place is a little far from where I am since I reside in Tucson and this is located in North Phoenix area, but heck, it was definitely worth the travels.  I ordered several rolls that sounds delicious. Starting off with a Fiesta Roll, which was labelled as \"Very Spicy\", I was like lets see how spicy this is! It turns out the spice was pretty hot, definitely hotter than Siracha, which most sushi restaurants uses. I couldn't quite figure out what type of spice it was but it sure did have a kick. At the same time not only was it spicy it was delicious.The spice did not over power the flavor of the salmon and tuna.   My second roll was the Baby Lobster roll which was just a mountain of eyegasm. There were rolls of salmon underneath a delicious sauce called \"Dynamite Sauce\". Ontop of that there were baby lobster tails sitting in the center. The rolls and the flavor all combined with the dynamite sauce was just amazing. It had a sweet like caramel taste to it.   Just after these two rolls I felt pretty satisfied. Usually I am able to eat more than 2 rolls but they were filling. I will definitely be returning here whenever I'm in the sushi mood and up in Phoenix again. Oh and when you leave, they always all tell you \"bye\" as well just like you were entering!"}
{"text":"I have a friend who has been a long time champion of this place for several years now. He swore to me up and down that it was amazing; so my wife and I made the long journey from south phoenix to glendale to see what this place was all about, and I have to say, I'm happy we did. We tried a wide variety of their rolls, and while I know sushi is typically expensive, this place was well priced for the quality we received. We tried the volcano roll, which was amazing. The combination of flavors was superb, it was a bit much to take in. My only criticism of it would be that it was a little too saucy, but still good. Then we moved onto the jalepno poppers, not sure what they were called, they were delicious! And just the right amount of spice. The las vegas roll was good, exactly what you would expect. The dragon roll, which is just eel on top of a california roll was great. We got a roll that had shrimp tempura in it as well and it was delicious, crunchy on the inside, not soggy like some places you go to.   Overall, I would say this is my favorite sushi place in the valley, with a very close second being Sushi Eye (they're just too expensive, and the quality doesn't justify the price). If you go here, you will love it."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a fellow sushi lover. Unfortunately, my boyfriend doesnt have an appetite for raw meat so I usually have to find a sushi place that also serves other less 'scary' dishes. This place is a  perfect fit.   He ordered their fried rice while I pigged out on eel, ebi, tuna, and albacore (to name a few). The plates were served quickly, and were fresh!   Please dont think that the waitresses are rushing you. They want to make sure you get what you ordered promptly.   I made the mistake of complaining to my sushi going friend that we felt rushed. He mentioned he knew the owners and that the waitresses are trained to serve the plates quickly.   Our glasses were never empty, which is a huge deal for me because I drink ALOT of water at all times."}
{"text":"Authentic sushi in Arizona, loved the spicy yellowtail roll, our friends liked the Vegas roll, and miso soup. 2 couples, total bill 80.00, 40 per couple and this wasn't their happy hour as it starts at 8pm."}
{"text":"For some reason, sushi brings out the snob in Americans. Unfortunately, it has been less of an opportunity to dine on high quality uncooked seafood, and more of a showcasing of who can look trendiest or appear to have the best taste.  When I'm done making fun of newbies who prefer California rolls, and tired of gaudy decorations, I need a place that gets down to business. A place where you can chill out and and stuff some salmon in peace.  Tokyo Lobby is that place.  The traditional rolls are always tasty, and I don't recall any individual item being more than about $10. What really shines here are the specialty rolls. I tried the 'Orgasm' and the flavor blew my mind. I really wanted the Sex on the Beach, but to my dismay the chef was out of the bananas for the tempura. Curses, but you knew I'd be back anyway!  My only problem is that I feel the eel sauce is too sweet...reminded me of an allspice flavor as opposed to the more savory sauces I've sampled elsewhere. Also, the seating is a bit crowded and they're closed on Sunday! That alone has lost them several visits from me. STILL WORTH IT.  Next time you're on Bell Road craving sushi, visit Tokyo Lobby and get a quality product without seeing swarms of snobs. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Definitely love the sushi here.  The quality of the rolls is amazing and the amount of rolls on the menu is impressive.  Staff are always on top of your order and there is almost never a wait for a table or the check.  My drink is always full and they are constantly making sure everything is delicious.  This place can get packed during lunch but I've never had to wait for a table, ever.  Highly recommended great sushi!"}
{"text":"Amazing Strawberry Nigori Saki! We really enjoy the Las Vegas Roll, the Phoenix Roll and the Mexican Roll. Great service!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch, the specials were just okay. There was nothing special about their sushi and the customer service was terrible. We needed to flag the waitresses down just to get a drink refill. I haven't been back and since found much  better sushi places in terms of taste, service, and specials."}
{"text":"You don't understand, this is the GREATEST place ever! No need to look to other reviews! I have never been so surprised of how great the food is and keep coming back when I get a craving for their amazing Mexican roll, or the HOT Vegas roll, and lets not forgrt the delicious, and my personal favorite, Scorpion roll! You can never go wrong here! The best INEXPENSIVE sushi joint ever!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of deep fried sushi this is the place to be! Sadly, I'm not that big of a fan but Tokyo Lobby is good. Unfortunately, I also missed Happy Hour but was looking forward to their  $5 sake bombs (Beer and a bottle of hot sake) that's a pretty damn good deal if you ask me.  Ordered about 3 rolls, vegetable tempura and a large bottle of beer to share with a friend. Every roll we had contained some kind of fried aspect. The vegetable tempura here was actually very good tbh and I found the sushi to be very edible. We managed to finish all of it! The unfortunate fact is that the flavors all seemed to be very similar because they all had tempura bits or fried part to them. Wish I could of tried their items that showcase the freshness of their fish more or their sashimi.  The service here is good and quick. It's pretty dark inside, but definitely more comfortable that how the outdoor seating seemed to be. Price point is typical for not being on happy hour and for the amount of food we got.  Holding Tokyo Lobby to 3 stars because I believe there could be some potential if I were to truly see the quality of their fish and I would definitely love to come back to enjoy their Happy Hour! Until next time TL!"}
{"text":"Went here as part of a double birthday celebration for my son and husband.  Once again, the orgasm roll was the hands down favorite.  They have indoor and outdoor seating, so you can enjoy the nice Arizona weather until it gets too hot.  The fish is always fresh and the prices seem to be consistent with other quality sushi places."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place with my best friend. Prices are good, especially if you go during happy hour, staff is friendly, and the food is fresh and tasty! The waiters usually give my friend's little daughter a special treat as we are leaving and her very own pair of kid friendly chopsticks. I've been to many other sushi places and none can really compare to the service and food I get here."}
{"text":"Mom and I hit this place for the tail end of happy hour.  Great choices of happy hour items and beverages.  We pigged out on sushi and appetizers. I had never had real wasabi before and it was served with my sashimi order.    The tempura was good and greasy. Typical selection. Looks like an ok place for quick affordable sushi options."}
{"text":"First time visit and won't be the last.  Ate outside as it was a beautiful spring evening in Phoenix.  Service was great, very friendly and attentive.  Not a sushi fan but wife and I both had Tempura Deluxe with teriyaki chicken.  Miso soup was excellent.  Portions very large, chicken sliced into bite size pieces, vegetable tempura light and not oily.  Dressing on small salad very tasty.  Wound up asking for a Togo box as neither of us could finish the chicken.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yeah...this place is pretty awesome. Excellent, attentive service and great food.   Everything I've ordered has been fresh and tasty.  Not much more to say except, GO THERE! It's good stuff."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are so friendly and offer exceptional, fast service! While the seating is sometimes less than desirable because it can be busy if you're sitting in the middle aisle, the sushi is well worth that! Haven't dined outside yet, but it always looks very nice out there."}
{"text":"As far as it goes, you can't find a better sushi \"happy hour\" in the valley. And by \"happy hour\" I mean almost all day every day (exception is Friday and Saturday 5:00 - 8:00 PM). Included in happy hour is a $5.00 Sake Bomb special. How can you beat that?! My husband and I can both get a drink, 2 rolls each and get out of there for $35.00. It is definitely our favorite cheap date place! Not only are the prices great, the food is awesome.   Due to the fact that this place has amazing food/prices/drinks/everything it can get super busy (it's not a very large restaurant) so you may want to call ahead if you are going with a group of 4+. They do have 2 large patio areas that are very pleasant to sit at when the weather is nice  Two thumbs up all around!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. I really do like this place but I feel as its too small and people are sitting on top of each other but I can't blame them for being busy. I got the baked lobster roll and the lettuce shrimp wrap. Both very good with quality ingredients. I do feel the lettuce wrap was a little over priced for the size. Staff is always nice and attentive. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is all tasteless. The soy sauce has no flavor, the wasabi has no flavor, the rolls have no flavor. I was just really disappointed because it tastes like you're just chewing tempura and rice. Pretty disappointed and probably not coming back. The service however, was great and she was very kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Hands down....our fave!!!  Haven't had anything yet we didn't like. Happy hour is great! Always great, friendly service...and when the weather is pleasant, we like sitting on one of the patios."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. Great tempura, scorpion roll was to die for. $5 sake bomb, wow. Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"I called 1 hour ahead on a Friday night. Got a reservation for 6 on the patio. Beautiful night in Phoenix. Overall, everything was excellent. No problem splitting the checks. The servers were anxious for our group to order. We ordered beers, wine, appetizers. There was a long gap between serving our entrees, but we didn't mind as we all shared tastes. A diverse group. Sushi lovers and non sushi lovers. Everyone seemed to love their food, except the one who ordered chicken fried rice as an entree. He said it was just okay. The rolls were amazing. We ordered several different kinds and enjoyed them all. Soup was good too. Service is matter of fact. Not obsequious, but pretty good. Recommend for affordable, casual night out."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi in the area. Terrible service and the sushi rolls are small and poor quality. Lunch specials are cheap for a reason. Rice is hard and stale as well as the rolls are tiny and don't have much filling. Under poor ownership or management. Sakana right up the road or even the Fry's on 67th and Bell have way better quality sushi rolls. Don't waste your money here if you are a true sushi lover."}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited almost three years to try Tokyo Lobby. I've driven past it a hundred times and from Bell Road, it doesn't look like much. It's in a Walmart parking lot, next to a Payless, for f*cks sake!  BUT! It's a good thing I decided to blow off existing reservations elsewhere to drop in on a rainy Friday night because I was truly impressed with the rolls, the nigiri, and the udon here.  For a small dining area, they do pack in the tables and it's bigger inside than it looks outside. There are two outdoor patios but I'll be sitting at the sushi bar from now on.   The two chairs in the middle of the bar were all that was available when my lady love and I arrived, so we got seated right away and asked the server to bring us two Kirin sake bombers- the intelligent way to begin any sushi meal on the west side.  I made sure to order a few rolls to try as well as some of my personal favorite nigiri- the tako AKA octupus. One of the best servings of tako I've had in Arizona. It was garnished with super-thinly sliced lemon on each of the two pieces of octopus tentacle and it was so tender and not gristly or rubbery as I've had elsewhere. I immediately asked for another order.  The specialty rolls were really well put together, with lots of fresh fish and interesting combinations of sweet, savory, salty and sour from the various sauces and ingredients. Textures- crunch and bite and melt in your mouth- are well thought out in the various house rolls.  About halfway through dinner, I got to speak some with the sushi chef about the day's special on a sign behind him \"blue fin tuna- $5.99 sushi, $14.99 sashimi\" and he mentioned that he \"only gets the good stuff\" from his supplier. Looking at it in his window at the sushi bar, it was that deep red color you hope for in a piece of good tuna and it did not disappoint when he handed it to me on a plate. Garnished with wasabi, he tells us \"one bite\" and there it goes, no soy sauce, either. Damn good.   I wanted more nigiri and he prepped some flounder and yellowtail belly for us. The texture of the flounder was like butter- owing to the way he sliced the filet and the yellowtail belly was wrapped around some julienned vegetables and herbs and topped with a raw quail egg. Again, he says \"one bite\" and it was outstanding.   I had to try an udon so I opted for the tempura udon which is accompanied by tempura veggies and a shrimp. I love anything with a complex broth and noodles and I was in love with this bowl of deliciousness. They even brought out some togorashi for me as seasoning.  I've eaten a lot of sushi in a lot of places including Michelin star restaurants in New York and California and I would pull up a chair for an omakase at Tokyo Lobby any time. I don't think there'd be fugu or toro but I know I'd get an incredibly memorable meal."}
{"text":"If your a sushi fan than look no further than this place ESPECIALLY during the week when prices are great fir happy hour! The presentation is quaint with service not being very friendly but is not rude by any means. They will even stand at times waiting for the opportunity to fill your drink asap."}
{"text":"What a treat.  We sure were surprised at the quality of the sushi here.  This is a small joint so come early or be prepared to wait.  The place right off of bell road which was nice and the parking was good.    We went to Tokyo Lobby at around 8pm and lucky for us there was a table open right when we got there.  The hostess sat as after the bus boy/server/bus boy cleaned the table.  It took about ten minutes before we could place our order and it seemed that way because one waitress was taking orders in the entire place.  We also had to ask for her to take our order also.  She seemed a little over whelmed with the amount of tables she had so we said here we go have a little patience.  We ordered all of our food at once knowing that if we ordered drinks and waited to order when the drinks came it would take forever.    Our Sushi was excellent! Very Very Very good and fresh.  The Edamame was so fresh and good and huge portion.  Our beers cold you cant go wrong with kirin!  But my favorite had to be the phoenix roll it was so amazing.  The spicy tuna role was very much the same as most places except they put this awesome sauce on it and it is actually spicy! go figure spicy to a phoenix resident!  Overall I say go and go again! They have bento bowls for those who want a combo but the Sushi A+++++  I would give 5 stars if the service was a little bit better  2 large kirin beers,Edamame,2 miso soups,2 rolls of sushi phoenix and tuna, and 2 sashimi plates with yellowfin tuna and octopus = 61 bucks.  Not too bad!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love Tokyo Lobby! We always receive good service and fresh sushi. I think my favorite thing about Tokyo Lobby is that their non sushi sushi is as great as the rolls with raw fish. My hubby is not a fan of real sushi so this is a place we can both go and enjoy our food. Favs? Monkey Brain (sounds way worse, it is quite tasty). Also the Chicago Roll. Best sushi on the west side for the price you pay. I would much rather give Tokyo Lobby my business than a chain restaurant that wants to charge me double for food and have less quality."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but during last 2 years it went from very good to very bad place. Everything taste the same no matter which one u order. overpriced, service is become very unpleasant , and we been charged on our c.card almost 3000$ , yes that's right, which was froze our account , and we had to deal with it like an hour over the phone to clear that out with our bank. At the end we didn't get even proper apology not from the server who made that mistake , not from management . Never going there again."}
{"text":"Love their garlic edamame and the spicy teriyaki chicken. Also the spicy crab roll is delish! My kids and I go often and love to sit outside. Also they play 80's music! So awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We had happy hour and that doesn't mean everything is deep- fried. (Cause that's not sushi). They have fresh ingredients, service was great , food is delicious and they even accommodated my request for no mayo. And great prices. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"My Favorite Sushi places; Always Fresh Sushi. Location; Very easy right off Bell and 59th Ave Restaurant; Cute little place with patio seating, usually sit outside during cooler days Food; By far the best tasting sushi in the Valley, always quick and what we ordered.  Service;  Very quick. Happy Hour prices is PERFECT"}
{"text":"This place is the jam... it's extremely difficult to find sushi in the deadly desert that is not only trustworthy but also, expertly crafted and insanely delicious. These guys care about their food and it's easy to see and taste. I live in Old Town Scottsdale and I make it a specific 34+ mile trek to and from Tokyo Lobby because I know I can count on them for quality. They fill up fast so, be mindful of what time you try to get in on certain days. If you gotta wait, just do it."}
{"text":"We used to love this place...two years ago.  Things have changed.  The last two times I've been there...everything was just so so.  They use the same sweet sauce on almost every roll.  My deep fried Ama Ebi heads were soggy.  The garnish for one of my plates was a piece of fake crab cut on an angle.... $100 and everything \"tastes the same\" to quote my daughter.  So three stars for an MEH dinner.    I'd rather pay the about same & drive across town to get a 5 Star meal at YASU BISTRO in PV.  BEST SUSHI IN TOWN."}
{"text":"I love Tokyo Lobby! Their happy hour is fantastic. The rolls are always fresh and delicious. I love sitting on the patio during the cooler months! ;)"}
{"text":"We have been coming this place since the day 1 they open, great place, good food, fresh fish... I'm one island girl knows my seafood !!! This is awesome !"}
{"text":"I love that it's happy hour most of the time.  Such a great deal!  Came in one time on a Friday night and there was a loud table having a good time.  We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef apologized on their behalf for them being so obnoxious, which I didn't mind since it was the weekend but I thought it was sweet of the sushi chef haha."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years. I come back every time I'm in town. They never have disappointed me!    Excellent rolls. Glendale roll. Vegas roll. Shrimp tempura roll. All the nigiri. Always spot on.   The ika salad here is the best I've ever had.   Service is always friendly and helpful. Such a welcome experience."}
{"text":"Went in on word of mouth. Loved the atmosphere and bar. Everything was wonderful. I wish they had all you can eat."}
{"text":"Best customers service I've ever had, we have had multiple servers come up to our tables asking if we needed anything. The presentation of the food was impressive, and the derive was also fast. I love this place !"}
{"text":"Absoloutely LOVE this place. Happy hour all day? Cant beat that! Great sushi, great service and groovy music!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Amazing happy hour and all day $5 sake bombers."}
{"text":"I adore Tokyo Lobby. I have been going to TL for years (since they were in a different location across the parking lot), and it's always amazing. I've never had a bad bite. I love spicy mayo (as do I), so I feel like this is my ultimate happy place, but if you are not super into spicy mayo, just know it is used heavily (a super bonus for me). The owners, Kelvin and Jennifer, are fantastic. I honestly love this place."}
{"text":"One of the better places on the West-side, and arguably the best sushi in the valley of the sun.  Like many others have said, most people probably drive by this place a couple times a day and don't think twice about it. It's in a very unassuming strip mall straddling the side of a Payless shoes.  Since the sushi has been covered by just about everyone else,  let me try to expand on some of their other dishes. The miso soup is great and has just the right amount of flavor. Occasionally it can be a bit on the salty side, but that occurrence is rare and shouldn't stop you from giving it a try. I've been addicted to Teriyaki dishes since living in Seattle and have to say this is about as good as it gets in Arizona.  The meat is usually tender and not over saturated with sauce. My only qualm would be with the rice. It's actually perfect, but I just wish they gave you more of it.  Overall though it's still one of my favorite places here in the valley. No reason you shouldn't stop by, especially if your on the west side."}
{"text":"I am still on a quest to find decent sushi in the Northwest valley. Came to this restaurant based upon the reviews and was hoping that THIS TIME the reviews would be right. Some thoughts.....  I have tried Sushi all over the world and have a favorite spot in Tucson I compare everything to, Sachiko Sushi. At Tokyo Lobby the fish was decent (yellow tail, tuna, and salmon) but a little on the small side and maybe a bit overpriced. I am surprised at how much more sushi is here compared to Tucson. I figured it would be as cheap if not cheaper due to more competition...oh well.  Had two rolls, a California and a Spicy Yellow Tail. Let me start with the California roll. This seemed to have mayo in it. I have found this to be the norm up here. I don't get that...mayo adds nothing except maybe to reduce the restaurants cost. Don't get me wrong, I like mayo just not in my California roll. The Spicy Yellow Tail tasted good but seemed small.   We rounded out the meal with Edamame and a Dinner salad. My wife said the Dinner salad was the best plate she had in the whole meal. I think that pretty much sums it up.   Total cost $32 without drinks. I think in Tucson I would have paid about $20. Oh well my quest continues."}
{"text":"Came here on my last day of a trip to Phoenix, and was surprisingly blown away! What I thought would just be some random Japanese place for dinner ended up not only being great, but also a great value! We ordered mostly from the happy hour menu, which was 5PM-9PM Monday-Friday, which gave us a bunch of rolls, and even tempura for ~$5.   The d√©cor and staff here are also great and you really feel like you're eating at a much more upscale restaurant than the cost would have you think. Will definitely come by again for a meal when I'm around the area."}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi! And I love it even more when it is from Tokyo Lobby.  I eat here at least once a week, budget be damned.  I can't help it. I'm addicted.  I probably need some kind of support group. I'm all about the soft shell crab and the blue fin. I am also a big fan of their bento boxes.  You get a lot for your buck.  And for appetizers, the Heart Attack is great (never in a million years would I have thought I would be paying for a heart attack).  I usually go as they are opening, because once lunch hour hits, an available seat will be impossible. You should really give this place a try, it is a real treat."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty good for Az. We like the orgasm roll quite a lot. They have a Midwestern discount with i.d. which is nice. We have also never had a bad experience with the sashimi. Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"I have been there few times. My favorite  is the baby lobster roll, it is fantastic, you should try it. The food is overpriced, you could end up paying $35 or more for lunch per person. They used to give Miso soup with every order, now they charge for it."}
{"text":"I think this is maybe 4.2 Stars. Good Sushi, CLEAN place.  Turnover?    I ventured to Tokyo Lobby based on good YELP reviews. It is in a nice strip mall in Glendale with plenty of parking, a nice patio, clean clear windows and signage.   Greeted quickly when we walked in and quickly seated at the sushi bar.    The place is clean.  The have GOLD STARS from the Health Department and it shows.  Yes, I check.  Regularly.  They have a good record and it shows.  The bathroom was clean too, no issues.  Not bad for late on a Friday night.  Sushi:  I am a fairly experienced sushi person. I found the sushi to be fresh, well cut and tasty.  Seared Albacore with scallions - YUM. Fresh Salmon - YUM. Also had tasty Uni, A very nice Albacore Sashimi Presentation and some other yummy stuff including a surprise Jalapeno Popper type thing.  THE PROBLEM?? Starter salad - Dressing good, Lettuce Old (wilted).  Somewhat hard to communicate with the sushi chef because the sushi bar seats are low and it is a little noisy.    The regular clients are probably more into simple sushi (rolls) than fine sushi / sashimi.  Our patricular sushi chef was very experienced, and very creative.  However he made it clear that he has worked at better sushi bars in is life, and was soon moving out of town.    NOTE to PROfessionals of all types:  ALWAYS be a pro.   You are \"on-stage\" at all times.  Be a PRO or go home.  For a small local spot, I was impressed."}
{"text":"How is does this place not have 5 stars?  Moving here from the Bay Area i was so afraid to try sushi.  I stumbled across this place with a friend after 6-7 months of living here.  I have not eaten sushi anywhere else for the last 7 years.  It is seriously that good!  Favorite rolls, Playboy, Mexican and Scorpion.  If you feel like splurging go for the baby lobster.  Its DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Definitely a five star sushi place. I have had sushi in many different sushi restaurants around Arizona but this one takes the cake!  The happy hour specials here are great and make good sushi affordable. The staff is also very friendly and you can tell they care about your experience at the restaurant. The chefs do a great job and the setting makes it feel authentic. I take my girlfriend here a lot and with the affordable specials they have, along with the good quality of the sushi, we might just become regulars."}
{"text":"Loving coming here!! The food is so good and the staff are always on their feet. Great prices too"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best Sushi Bars in Phoenix, very good service!! I would brag about how fresh the food is but then more people would go and make it harder to get in !!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I always get a warm greeting the second I walk in the door. I always thought the sushi was great but I don't really eat at any other sushi places. Well I finally had sushi somewhere else and instantly regretted it. Freshness was nothing compared to how it is here at toyko lobby. You can tell everyone here really works hard and take time in little details to make this such a great restraunt. Keep up the good work guys! I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my (and my son's) favorite spot for lunch. Food is absolutely delicious and fresh. Very clean dining room and friendly staff. When ever we have to be in that part of town we make sure to stop in for a meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good rolls and miso! Music and service is good Stopped for lunch my gyoza was good but overcooked. I got a beef teriyaki bento it came swimming in sauce still good after wiped the excess off All in all a better experience than most"}
{"text":"This sushi bar is my absolute favorite! I will literally drive from Prescott (about a two hour drive) just to eat here. The atmosphere is very mellow; love the '80s jams! I also love how everyone is greeted as they enter the restaurant.  I've never had a roll I haven't liked here. I have to admit, I haven't tried much else of their menu other than sushi. But from what I've tasted, everything here is delicious. And their tempura rolls are always delicious without being oily. They're very accommodating here as well. I once went in when I was pregnant and they made some very good recommendations based on my restricted diet. Keep up the great work Tokyo Lobby!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to eat here last night, they welcomed us in which was cool, they took our drink order as soon as we sat down which was nice. We weren't quite ready to order when they brought us our drinks and after that it took like 10 mins for them to come back to take our order... Then when our food arrived it was wrong we had to flag someone down and when they came they got an attitude that it wasn't correct. We waited forever before someone came to refill our drinks, they come and go so quick you can't even get a word in. We waited 15 mins for our bill and another 10 to get our card and receipts back! It was in all fairness busy however that doesn't entitle them to ignore tables or rush in and out without asking if everything was ok. The food was good but not great... Nothing to shout about IMO. I was more disgusted by the rudeness and the lack of giving a crap on how they treated their customers! I had been here before during lunch and it was always good this was the first time I had been in there for dinner and sadly the last time I will ever be back! Customer Service is so important! You pay yes for the food but also for great service and perhaps it was just a bad night for them...  But honestly they were too busy running around and not being careful, we witnessed them dumping a tray of drinks on a female customer, the table next to us also had the wrong order.... So bad night indeed."}
{"text":"Favorite local sushi place.   Get there early or be prepared to wait as it gets packed quickly and people tend to order lots of items. Fish has always been very fresh and they have some different and tasty rolls. Service is attentive Pricing is right on target for the quality."}
{"text":"This place is awesome great service fresh sushi and made right as you order it fabulous choices great place to eat and I waitress Ashley was awesome we will go back again"}
{"text":"We both had the Bento boxes. Teryaki Chicken was very tasty. Great tempura and yummy California rolls. Great service, too. We highly recommend this place. They also have Full sushi bar."}
