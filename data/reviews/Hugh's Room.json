{"text":"I'm at Hugh's Room more than once a month. The shows are unique and the class of music and musicians is outstanding. The tribute nights are usually 8 or 9 different musicians with their back up, performing two songs each ,or more.  20 songs interperted in wonderful ways, how can that be beat for around 25.00. The menu really needs to be changed up.  It has remained the same for years.  It should at least change seasonally.  Especially when many of us are there frequently.  Best bet for a night out."}
{"text":"Usually I come out twice a year to Hugh's room to see a specific band.  The staff has always been really good on Saturdays and a nice dining venue to listen to live music.  The nights I've gone they'll book dinner for 6 or 6:30 and the band will start-up around 8:30. (not sure what other shows are like) I've tried a few of their dishes over the years some were ok, but the combo that works for me is the ceasar salad and pasto pan chicken. Luv it!  ($35 dollars for 1 concert special...app, entr√©e and an ok dessert)."}
{"text":"We waited forever for our lamb shanks, and they tasted like bland rubber. No flavour, horrible texture. I mean, they served it with steak knives!  The show was fantastic, however. Don't go for the food or ambience. Go for the shows."}
{"text":"Went here Wednesday night to see Ben Sures. The show was awesome and as a venue this place is pretty great. It's laid out well so that there really aren't any bad seats. We sat at a high table near the back and were still able to see the bands well. I believe there were only 2-3 servers for the whole place and they seemed to be stretched pretty thin. That being said the service was very slow and it was hard to get the server's attention when we wanted to order another round. We didn't eat here which based on other reviews was probably a good thing, but we did order cocktails which were very reasonably priced at about 6.00$ each. I ordered my usual whiskey sour and it was one of the worst cocktails I've ever had. They didn't use proper bar sour but what tasted like very watered down orange juice. I managed to improvise a simple syrup from sugar packets and water that made it at least drinkable. After waiting and waiting with empty glasses I made intense direct eye contact with the server for an uncomfortable amount of time. He finally got the hint and came to our table for a second round. The CC and ginger I ordered next was decent ( but how much can you mess that up?) After this we didn't see the server again until he plopped the bill on our table without saying a word. I would go back if there is a good band because structurally its a good venue but I think I'll stick to beer, bottled beer; I don't trust the bartender's ability to pour. Oh P.S. the washrooms have almost no water pressure making it very challenging to wash your hands properly. I'm a bit of a germ freak so this makes me nervous about the cleanliness/ hand washing situation overall. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Visited Hugh's Room during the folk music festival that was in town to see a couple bands that were taking part. Booked my ticket a few days in advance and headed down there with a friend who was in town specifically for the festival. I was excited to visit a new place in Toronto that I wouldn't normally go to, but that excitement wore off as the evening went on. I don't see myself visiting this place for anything else other than a band is in town that I really, really want to see. Go here for the shows and drinks only, not the food.   Pros: - They have wine, it was good - Our server was very friendly, but service was definitely slow (even though the place wasn't packed, but I think there was only 2 servers for the whole place) - The band I went to see was awesome, so that helped the experience - Service for purchasing tickets over the phone was friendly and helpful  Cons: - Very expensive ticket to get into the place in my opinion ($25) - Service was slow (again, and the place was not packed by any means) - The food was not worth the money paid - ordered a bacon cheddar salad that sounded awesome on the menu, but ended up being iceberg lettuce with bacon bits and barely any cheese - No reserved seats - which wasn't a problem for this slower night, but I could see being an issue if there were more people coming in to see the shows"}
{"text":"The bottom line  - Service is terrible  - Food is beyond terrible (and expensive). It's like bad dinner theatre cuisine. You'll pay $20 for an entree that should cost $10 and is bad to boot. They get you because the only way to get a reserved (and good) seat is to book for dinner.   - It's a solid venue for music.   So...you are, frankly, better off eating before...booking for dinner...and \"eating\" the absolute minimum...if I went again (doubtful), I'd order one of the harder to screw up appetizer and maybe split a main and then just let it sit there uneaten."}
{"text":"A dinner theater experience. The food and service was great. Very friendly staff. The squash and cranberry soup was good. We heard Dala and they were wonderful. We like the folk vibe."}
{"text":"If you are into Folk or Roots music, this is the best venue in the city.  Firstly, though, if you are under 40, this place probably isn't relevant to you.  Of course there will be exceptions, but realistically, this isn't your place.  Performers I've seen here include Iris Dement, Leon Redbone, Roy Book Binder, Tom Paxton, Richie Havens and David Lindley.  Performers booked for 2011 include John Hammond, Duke Robillard, Lucy Kaplansky, Martyn Joseph, Jesse Winchester (!), Zachary Richard, Loudon Wainwright III, Judy Collins (!) and David Bromberg.   Many of these names are legends and near-legends in this genre of music!  The only reason I didn't give this one-of-a-kind listening venue a 5-star rating is for their food (which is good but not great), and their service, which is sometimes a bit spotty.  One does, however, go there for the music, not the food."}
{"text":"It's hard to write a mixed review. Sometimes I wish Yelp split the star-rating based on certain parameters but...  1. We had a great time at Hugh's this evening based solely on the fact that the mixed entertainment included both good music and great comedy.  2. The food was atrocious. My Beef Stroganoff was akin to a Lipton Sidekick and my wife returned both her mussels (sour, off flavour) and even her salad! How do you screw up a garden salad? To boot, it was all quite expensive ($20 average entree).  3. The couple we were with came after we had received our entrees and were scared off by our remarks. One ordered the \"Olive plate\" and the other ordered the \"Cheese plate\".  The paltry cheese selection of the cheese plate, a few chunks of counter-bought cheddar and mozzeralla were accompanied by get this: DIGESTIVE BISCUITS!!!  Go to Hugh's for the tunes, not for the grub. More like \"Ugh's Room\"."}
{"text":"I have been to the Hugh's Room a couple of times as I search for an upscale blues and jazz venue in Toronto that is similar to Scullers or Regattabar in Boston, my hometown.  The entertainment has been mixed with excellent blues singers at the Etta James festival and a poor performance by a disinterested blues singer, Susie Vinnick. The quality of the performers is not high enough to justify any cover compared to the myriad of pubs that provide local bands in the Toronto area.  The biggest negative is that purchase of a ticket does not ensure a seat unless one makes a dinner reservation and orders the poor food. This is so ridiculous that I will not go back.  Pros: - Friendly servers - The acoustics and the viewing are quite good.  - Some appetizers are healthy and tasty  Cons: - Slow service - Expensive ticket for the quality of entertainer - Entree's are average at best - Still just a little step up from the typical pubs that dominate the Greater Toronto music scene  If anyone knows of higher quality venues in the GTA, please let me know."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars for the venue. Love the venue, hate the food. It's not just the food I hate, its the cost of the food. They got rid of their fixed prix menu and now you're stuck with an overpriced fixed screw you menu. Makes me so angry to pay those kinds of prices. The thing that REALLY angers me is if you don't eat there, and show up just for the show, you will more than likely have the worst seats in the place. If there are 4 of you, good luck getting seated together. Oh, and the service we had? Come on, who puts a NEW waitress on a sold out Saturday night show?! Our bread came AFTER the dessert, and she had the nerve to say \"the kitchen seems to be pacing themselves\" Say what?!"}
{"text":"First time here. We just missed the previous incarnation of Hugh's Room having had tickets for the week after it abruptly closed. And it didn't seem like there were any reviews since it reopened. So here goes.  We started with the focaccia appetizer, which was fine. Olives, herbed butter and cubes of what seemed like fresh tasty bread. Sized for one, but still shareable.  For mains we went for the pasta and the chilli. The pasta was a healthy-sized portion, with a good sized link of house made sausage. The sausage seemed a bit dry, but had good flavour. Overall, it was a flavourful creamy pasta dish.  The chili looked a little on the arty side -- versus the hearty side. But there was also a fair amount of flavour going on too. It was a veggie chili, between two halves of a zucchini. It ended up filling along with the baguette bread the friendly waitress brought out.  Overall, a decent meal. It's not on the bargain side of things, but there is care in the dishes showing that compliments the music on stage after you finish eating.  Which is starting, so I have to stop typing."}
{"text":"Now that I've had time to settle, I am ready to write this review.  Hugh's Room offers an eclectic range of performers, which sometimes includes a well-known act of the old school. I saw that one of those was coming to town and called and arranged for two tickets to the Leon Redbone show 2 months in advance, knowing it would likely sell out. On the phone, they asked if we would be dining before the show, and I said probably not. Hugh's Room took my credit card info and ended the call.  Well, when we arrived for the show, over 60 minutes before show time, we found that ordering tickets two months in advance DID NOT get you a reserved seat. Apparently, that only comes if you are willing to commit to eat their (terrible looking) food. I was so angry they didn't bother to tell me that on the phone. It's not a cheap ticket to this place for the service they gave us.  To add insult to injury, we were given stools, shoved in a corner, and then the waiter didn't even bother to hand us the bill for our beers at the end of the night. He was too important for us lowly non-dinner-eaters, so just left it on a table nearby. Needless to say, no tip for him.  The crowd is quite old, and apparently they don't mind bad service and overpriced meals. I can still stand while I listen to music, so, unless there's a really great performer who I can't see elsewhere, I won't bother with this venue. If there is a really great performer, I'll lie and say I am having dinner and then just order a salad.  I give Hugh's Room the finger.  Damn, this happened almost 2 months ago and clearly that is not enough time for me to settle."}
{"text":"I took in Midge Ure on January 14, 2013 at Hugh's Room. I found the place to be great, acoustics, amazing, and the staff was very friendly and well organized. The food was good (not 5 star cuisine, but good) and the reality is that if you are in Hugh's Room, you came for music, food is a secondary part of the experience. I think it is a great place for music and would come back anytime. The servers were excellent considering the number of tables they were looking after, all of who arrived pretty much at the same time in anticipation of the concert.  Also took in China Crisis in late April 2013 and enjoyed it tremendously. Great sound and a wonderfully sophisticated way of watching great artists!"}
{"text":"Hugh's Room is NOT closed! I was just there June 16, 2018.  The night started a little rough when we went to see our old school classmate Jory Nash perform because there was a wall between us and our friends. We knew the wall would be there but did not expect that it would obstruct our own view of the stage for half the people at our stable.  It is a very atmospheric and pretty large space. There is zero natural light so if you are going to take photos of anything that is not on stage I recommend using a flash, something I never do (including the photos I have added to this post that have been heavily edited). For those with disabilities, there are some steps at the front of the space and down to the seating area. The hardest is the bathroom. Lots and lots of stairs.  My cosmo was excellent. Overall I think everyone was happy about their drinks. It was the food that was the issue. Sadly, Hugh's Room lived up to its bad reputation for not very good food. Small portions, full prices so it it supposed to be tapas style but only one thing impressed us. The sirloin which was very rare and not medium the way the menu described. Still, tender and very flavourful.  That said, the night began with over-priced fries that were not particularly good, over-salted croquettes (we all agreed on that one) and a plain but not thrilling Burrata Caprese Salad. The underwhelming salad and small portion of fries did not surprise me but the croquettes being so salty worried me.  The fried Quebec cheese curds was absolutely flavourless and the pieces were so small that all you could really taste was the breading. That plain tomato sauce sure did not help.  The Prosciutto Ravioli with sundried tomatoes came in a rustic red sauce. You know I love pasta but this was too thick and tough. Unforgivable. There were quite a few sundried tomatoes but where the hell was the prosciutto? I think I had one small bite. #whereisthemeat?  This is the place to drink and listen to music. Come on a full stomach. The worst thing you can do to me as a food writer is bore me. The second thing is not know how to make pasta. The third thing is over-seasoning the food. A good sirloin is not going to save you but you can make one hell of a drink.  Read full review here: http://www.suziethefoodie.com/jory-nash-at-hughs-room/"}
{"text":"What a funny little hideaway spot in the middle of nowhere. I was invited through an artist's (Shane Koyczan) page via Facebook and had never heard of the place before, neither, it seems, has Yelp.ca!   There were no reviews for me to devour in order to prepare me for what I was going to walk into! So I shall take the responsibility and REVIEW for all of you who like to KNOW before you GO.   Hugh's Room is a performance space for musicians and the like. The night I went, Shane Koyczan (think Vancouver Olympics) was performing his 'spoems' (song poems) with his band, who eagerly brought to the audiences attention how brilliant the sound was in the venue (attn: Music lovers!).   Despite the iffy location of this joint, the inside refuses to be classified as anything but refined, casual with abso-effing-lutely delicious food. My sister and I were eyeballing every passing dish with an envy that begged for larger stomaches and fatter wallets. I meagerly dined on the veggie soup of the day and some french fries (both of which were satisfying).   The place is set up with tables all facing towards the stage, so I am suspecting people don't come here for dinner without getting a show as well. Two birds with one stone, people. Two birds with one stone.   Our server was delightfully hilarious. He treated me and my sister like we were royalty (and considering how we were dressed, it was obvious we were anything but-- dress code didn't seem to be a big deal here), but he was ever-so charming and smiley we left him a big, fat tip out of our dieting wallets.   Thoroughly enjoyable evening out. Perfect atmosphere of casual and fancy schmancy that it's easy to enjoy without feeling hoity-toity. Defnitely recommend as a go-to venue for a relaxed night."}
{"text":"We all joked that we could at least eat at the nearby pizza joint if we couldn't eat here. This was based on the many negative reviews of the food.  The 7 of us all enjoyed our food. I had the steak penne special. It was very good.    The service was impeccable. Some of the best service I have ever had.  Her name was Tara. We were there for a sell out show of Anthony Gomes on November 8.  Great mood and people.  Could have been four stars if they serviced premium tequila."}
{"text":"Awful on every level. Only here for a music show otherwise I would have never come for a meal.  They were out of the only 4 dishes of remote interest on the menu and everything we did end up ordering was so poorly done (4 dishes!) Neglectful service to top it off. Stay away unless coming for a show and if so, eat beforehand!!"}
{"text":"It's true what others say--that this is a live music venue first.  But it's such a warm and homey place for such an eclectic bunch of musicians that you don't mind the food being...well, more ordinary than you'd like in a city with as many restaurants as Toronto has.  In my short time in the city I've come for jazz and folk CD releases for friends, tributes to the greats shared by 6 or 7 excellent performers, and some greats themselves--Jesse Winchester, J.P. Cormier, Connie Kaldor, among them.  The wait staff I've encountered have always been stretched but affable as they skate their way around close tables balancing drinks and food.  As far as said food goes, order the hot, yummy mussels and frites ($14 + $3) and one of their many beers on tap and you have a perfectly decent meal while you listen to terrific music.  Get on their mailing list to know ahead of time who not to miss."}
{"text":"Hugh's room brings back the concept of a dinner club with live entertainment. We went there to see the Good Lovelies' Christmas show which was great. As a number of reviewers have already noted, it is an entertainment venue first.  I started with the soup of the day which was a broccoli and cauliflower soup. It wasn't but it was more of a puree than a cream-based soup.  The entree that I had was the pesto pan chicken which I enjoyed. The tomatoes and onions brought in a variety of flavours. The bacon was a nice touch as well. These days it seems that restaurants are overdoing bacon and adding it to everything, but with this dish it worked really well, giving it some crunch and a contrast to the other flavours.  Our server was good, but in agreement with what other reviewers have said, the servers seemed to be overworked there. So, we didn't end up seeing a lot of our server. In some ways this is a good thing - it means that he doesn't interrupt you much when you are watching the show - but at other times you end up waiting for service."}
