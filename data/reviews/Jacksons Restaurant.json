{"text":"Neither the food nor the service are good. Biggest issue is that they just don't staff this appropriately. Even if you're sitting at the bar, the bartender is stretched because they have the tables in the bar area. This means that the tables in the bar area get poor / slow service too.  No different for the remaining tables in the restaurant area. The food is average at best.  Night 1, bartender forgot my orders each time (a beer, an app, a side of ranch). Each time it was, \"Oh, yeah, you wanted...\"  Night 2, almost full seats at the bar equals bartender flying by the table \"you decide yet?\"  Then, when dropping off my drink order, she flies by and drops my drink off while letting some of it spill on my leg. Of course she didn't notice because she was rushing to get back to the bar."}
{"text":"Restaurant is located in the Doubletree hotel. I had calamari and a wedge salad. The calamari had a great flavor and was a decent sized portion. Not your traditional calamari with a red sauce, but very good. The wedge salad was good, but on the small side. Overall a good meal."}
{"text":"I'm almost stunned at how bad this was. My bus driver told me to walk to Primanti's. But it was raining and their online menu looked ok. Wrong. Everything was off, hoping to get a nice pasta...it wasn't there. Ok, their menu says, house special Short Ribs,....it's 6:15 ..\"We're out\"
There are so few good things I can say about this experience. The bartender was mediocre at best, my steak a $40 NY Strip was a 2, but what really got me was the Caesar Salad. At least try...it was a bunch of lettuce with a $3.00 bottle of cheap dressing. At least spring for Kens if you're charging $9.00

I give stars because I want to believe they are better than this."}
{"text":"I sat down at the bar and was immediately greeted by the bartender. I ordered the rotisserie chicken which comes with a side of jasmine rice and root vegetables. The bartender came up after a few minutes with a cup of soup. She explained that my chicken was taking a bit longer than expected and with a sincere apology offered the shrimp and corn chowder. A side of naan with olive tapenade was also presented. It was delicious and appreciated. The chicken came out shortly after and was also excellent. The service was about on par with a typical bar inside a restaurant, but was a touch slow. Other than that, an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"A regular in my rotation. I generally always go with the tasting menu. The only bad things I can really say is that the menu changes periodically and I run into situations where something I really enjoyed is no longer available. Any pizza appetizer has been great - thinner crust than most places which I prefer. Honey laquered rotisserie chicken is also good. Hard ot screw up a wedge salad. Nice atmosphere. I always eat at the bar and the service there has always been great - great view of the oven for the pizza there as well."}
{"text":"Good menu and lots of choices.  Can be pricey but they have many lunch options.  I always enjoy their soups."}
{"text":"Wait staff is friendly and attentive, but breakfast was terrible.  Flavorless, somewhat undercooked omelette.  Frozen potatoes.  I can't speak to the rest of the day, but breakfast was bad."}
{"text":"Really good food,  And service Kathy was super helpful with suggesting things on the menu. I would definitely recommend this Restaurant."}
{"text":"High price for meh food. 

The shrimp and chorizo soup uses canned shrimp. Not sure how any chef would find that acceptable. 

Three steaks were ordered with my party and two of them were cooked for a level too long. And the lobster risotto that comes with the steak had no sign of lobster or even lobster taste -- just a cheese risotto. 

The service also wasn't great.

Since going we have found many people with the same experience -- overpriced food."}
{"text":"Our server nice & polite. But some of the food needs changed.  My husband did the tasting menu (courses 1,2,3,4) - While I did not, we both chose the same main course which was some type of shrimp entree.  Can't remember what it was called.  Not too bad, but nothing over the top since they are supposed to have chefs; shrimp was nice sized.  The calamari appeared to be frozen, not freshly breaded.  They poured the chili glaze on it which then obviously made it soggy.  The salad was kind of two rolled of sections of lettuce with very little dressing drizzled around the plate.  Opted for the gelato tasting for dessert.  All three flavors were very good.

They used to have individual tv's at the booths but they are now gone.  But they kept the metal attachment that they sat on there.  Weird."}
{"text":"This is not the restaurant the website or menu links to. This restaurant is in Coraopolis, where as the restaurant linked to is in Cannonsburgh."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp and chorizo chowder. I had to add both salt and pepper which is quite unusual for me. I could not taste the chroizo and thought it needed more flavor. The texture was good and the vegtables were not overcoked but it lacked any real taste.

I also had the chipotle shrimp tacos. They were larger than expected which was good but the shrimp seemed to be Sysco-style premade crunch-turd shrimp lumps and not whole shrimp, which, for $14, you should not be serving me. It was accompanied by a side of tortilla chips and salsa which were obviously prepackaged and bland. How hard is it to make some pico de gallo or homemade salsa?

The only reasons you are not getting two stars is the waitress was very pleasent and deserves to be working at an establishment where they actually care about the ingredients and are not relying on premade staples."}
{"text":"I am not sure where the negative review came from. I just had an excellent NY Strip dinner with cheddar bacon grits and broccolini. It was very good. Contrary to a prior review, there was no pizza on the menu. Yes, there is a TV on the inside end of the booth. However, you are free to adjust the volume, change the station, or just shut it off. I was traveling and dining alone so I actually liked it. I got caught up on the days events while I waited. My steak was ready very quickly. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing. Give it a try. I think most people will really like the place."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant before and I would say The food was three stars however we ordered pick up and the food was so bad it tasted like it was microwaved out of a frozen food box. After reviewing how many times I've eaten there in the quality of food I would say that the best I could give this place is 2 stars based upon the quality of the meals and the service and my recent experience I will give this restaurant in one star review."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar experience, and what an experience it was.  I understand that this is in an area that is more college than not (especially since a dorm is within walking distance) and that it is attached to a hotel.  But the standards should have been a little bit higher, especially since the bar manager was in the establishment the whole time I was there.

Came here after attending a wedding just to continue on the buzz I already had going.  Heck, I was staying within the hotel itself so I had no worries about transportation and when I was done could just go up to my room.  It's a nice space inside and you can tell they put detail into the decoration.  The bar itself is quite big, stretching for quite a distance and more than enough seating around it for a large group of friends that want just mingle.

The bar manager was out and about greeting patrons.  Stopping by every table and stool and having a good time.  However, when some patrons got rowdy, he barely did anything about it (more on that later).  Drink prices were the norm for any bar in Allegheny County and decent tasting as well.

Now, back to the rowdy crowd.  As I stated prior, this is kind of a gathering spot for some local college students.  The old Holiday Inn that is now a dorm for Robert Morris is right across the parking lot.  Other wedding guests and myself were having a good time and the somewhat entitled college kids decided we were having too good of a time.  In fact, at one point a few of them attempted to pick a fight with some of the wedding guests.  What did the bar manager do, nothing.  He watched.

After that little fiasco, I decided to finish my drink and retire for the night.  Doubt I would ever come back her for drinks, might stop back to check out the menu for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Had a late night cap at the bar and received excellent service from Quinn. She made us feel extremely welcome. When we meet her manage Benedetto Biono we were greeted again with warmth and a wonderful conversation. Would love to eat there on our next visit to Pittsburgh, as the food looked and smelly delicious. Thank you for your great service. W will be back."}
{"text":"Was here with a rather large group in a private room in the back. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, including the pizza, mushrooms and scallops. I had the first two, neither of which were great. I had the mahi- mahi special which was just OK. The service was fine, although overall, things proceeded rather slowly. It's rather expensive, and none of the food rated more than a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced. The iron steak was maybe 8 ounces. Dry. The only other food on the plate was a lob of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. Again dry. No au jus. No butter. No salt. $29.00 Lololol.  No wonder the place was empty on a Saturday night at 7:00. 
The salad of fire/hydrant greens had 4 cherry tomatoes, one slice of a red onion and a teaspoon of goat's cheese. Not enough dressing to hydrate the greens. 
The kid's mac and cheese had a good taste but no accompaniments. Totally wasted on the kid's menu. 
No refill on our soft drinks.  Total for two adults and one kid .... $100 with tip. Went to Dairy Queen for a decent dessert."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is ok, definitely could have eaten better elsewhere and for a cheaper price compared to here."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos are exceptional! Great service! They had taken a long time with waiting on my table of 2 during lunch because of an unexpected large group that came in. They provided free dessert for the wait. I normally don't have slow service here so it was nice they offered this."}
{"text":"If you are staying at the Doubletree, check it out. Bar menu is reasonable, full menu is pricey. Food is good and fresh. Service was good."}
{"text":"Had  cup of shrimp and chorizo chowder by recommendation of the person next to me. It is more of a potato soup with chorizo in it. Shrimp was scarce and canned. It was good but did not meet the outstanding recommendation of the person next to me .

Ordered the pub burger which was awesome. Fries extra hot and coleslaw was great . Pickle crisp and chilled.  Best burger I have had in a long time.

Balsamic glaze on the burger was the trick!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with colleagues - it was decent, but not great. Steak was over cooked for medium, but edible. Service was average. A bit pricey for the quality. I must say that the presentation of the food was artful!"}
{"text":"So so doubletree bar. Bar maid does too much talking and not paying attention to customers. #1 rule in bartending NEVER leave the bar unattended.  She did it 4 x in 2 hours. Guess it's acceptable here ? 
Food okay nothing special. 
Elevator floors are disgusting. Rooms old but clean small bathroom. 
Breakfast bar leaves a lot to be desired.  Really ??small fruit flies around the fruit. Disgusting and nobody notices this ? You kidding ?
Won't return as a Diamond member this was disappointing.  The smell of stale cigarette smoke permeates parts of the hotel."}
{"text":"Had a mid- week lunch at the place at the suggestion of a couple of locals who advised this was among the first to be part of a growing \"chain\" of Jackson's restaurants. Based on my experience, this could be the shortest-lived \"chain\" in history as the creation and delivery of the food falls well short of the concept and elaborate menu descriptions.    

I ordered the Cuban/grilled sandwich which goes down as the absolute worst I've ever had. The meat was approaching 1/4 inch thick, was very chewy and, as I found out after a couple of bites, had a strange smell (just to be certain it wasn't my faulty \"schnozz\" I asked a friend to confirm...which she did with a loud \"yuk\"). It's always been my understanding and experience that pickles were \"inside\" the sandwich. Not here. Instead, I received a pickle spear as a garnish. My friend's steak would probably have been fine on its own but had been drowned in a mundane sauce he thought may have been A-1. Overall a lame presentation delivered hurridly by a panicked waitress. 

I may try the place again when visiting the city in November as my experience seems to be out of step with the feelings of other Yelpers and friends. Until then, I'm definitely not a fan."}
{"text":"Jackson's is a great find! They have a power lunch special during the week for around eight dollars. Included in this is a big sandwich, a side dish, and a drink! Great price, great product, and a great value!"}
{"text":"The service was ok.  It was Sunday and the bartender was also the waitress and was bussing the tables as well.  So it was a little slow. She recommended the sous vie short ribs.  They did not disappoint.  They are a boneless beef rib that was as tender as any fillet.  The hash, asparagus, and mushroom that came with the dish were very good as well. The only thing I would change is the sauce reduction.  It was a tad too sweet and the dish could have done with less so you could taste the amazing meat and sides.  For dessert I had the gelato tasting.  It was very well presented and very good.  Overall I would order this again."}
{"text":"I am a traveler and this restaurant is attached to the Hilton Doubletree Airport in Pittsburg. I found the food and service very good. A good surprise to not have to leave the property"}
{"text":"I came for lunch after taking the red eye from Los Angeles to Pitt. I wanted to take my mother and father to lunch and we came to Jackson's. We put in our drink order and only one out of three drinks were correct. The bartender had to serve the bar and 7 tables. She worked her ass off with no support. Attached is a picture of the pulled pork we received for reference.  

We spoke to the chef and he proceeded to blame someone else in the kitchen for the food he is responsible for preparing. 

STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm being lazy because I am staying at the hotel. 

The food here is ok and the service is good. Only problem is the prices are high and you expect better."}
{"text":"I've here two times.  First night the food and drinks were good.  The next night a zero stars....  So I averaged the two nights.    

The sea bass is uninspiring,  especially when I got a 7inch hair in the couscous.  

Stink to the wine;  it's not a bad list and the kitchen can't get hair in your glass."}
{"text":"Attached to the Doubletree by Hilton.  This is a really good place to get some really good food.   Not a big place, not a big menu.  I think that's the advantage, not TOO many choices......focus on really good dishes !!!!

Past, Fish, Seafood and Steaks.  Only 2-3 selections per category, but all are top notch.   We had a Filet, NY Strip, Salmon and Chicken Breast.    All we're prepared perfectly. 

Service was prompt, courteous and attentive.   Not overly attentive, but just right.   Waiter also knew the menu.......such a plus. 

Wine list is same as the menu, not overbearing with a bunch of $000's bottles.  Names you know at prices you'll like. 

I've been here twice, once in Fall and once in Spring.  My food was great both times.
