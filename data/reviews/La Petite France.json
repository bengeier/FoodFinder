{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here late on a Friday night and couldn't have had a better experience. The food was all delicious, especially the crepes and the brie. The service was prompt and included some very helpful and affordable wine recommendations. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming of my spinach and mushroom omelette and fresh croissant. The service was friendly, and extra points from this Wisconsinite for using the term \"bubbler\" for the drinking fountain!"}
{"text":"What a pleasure it was to find this restaurant! Google map took us to the wildflower restaurant next-door by mistake, so we're glad that we got out of the car and walked around to finally find La Petite France hidden in the back. The food is delicious! The service is wonderful! And the owners are very sweet! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had dinner at La Petite France tonight for summerlicious. I am francophone myself and was looking forward to showing my boyfriend a taste of fine French cuisine. As far as the food was concerned, we weren't disappointed. 
We had the quiche and the mussel salad to start. The quiche was creamy, flacky and flavorful. The mussel salad was fresh, not too much dressing, very reminiscent of French salads. 
As mains we had the tilapia and the sole. 
The blackened tilapia was also delicious and the mango salsa really accentuated the taste. Great rice and veggies. As for the sole, do not order!! Very mushy, tasted like eggs and butter. We couldn't eat it. 
The profiterole and crème brulée were wonderful to finish up. 
My complaint though was about the service. Our waitress was very detached, with nothing warm and inviting when she seated us. I don't know if it's just me, but for a French restaurant at dinner time, it seemed inappropriate to wear sweat pants, a tank top and flip flops. Just unprofessional. After we were seated, no one came to our table for a good 15 minutes. She was cold when she took our order, our bread didn't come to the table until 5 minutes before our food came. No check ins throughout the meal and a cold thank you at the end. It just put a real damper on our whole evening and we wanted to leave as soon as we sat down and waited. 
I do want to stress that the food was very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at La Petite every couple of months. I love the atmosphere- the soft French songs playing in the background, lightly dimmed with candle lights, relaxed and delicious! The servers are wonderful, very friendly and attentive. The food has never disappointed. The French chef cooks with amazing consistency, and provides many daily specials. The French onion soup- to die for. The escargots- WOW! The spinach salad with blue cheese and poached pairs is so delicious! We enjoy all of the entrées including the beef bourignon, the duck confit, and the shrimps and scallops curry - one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had! To top it all of the best creme brulé and an amazing cappuccino, la petite France never disappoints. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"I go to France quite a bit and ironically, just arriving from Paris on Friday night, the wife suggested we go to La Petite France to try out their \"Arizona Restaurant Week\" menu.

Having just dined out in Paris, I figured \"Well, what the heck\".

The food that I had that evening at this restaurant was far and above better than the meals I've had at bistros throughout France.

Excellent, rustic French cuisine -- the type that you can find in a small neighborhood where the French actually eat.   A job well done and now my \"Go To\" place for French food!

If you like French cuisine, do yourself a favor and visit La Petite France.  What you get here is better than you will find in France."}
{"text":"If I was blindfolded, seated and my blindfold was taken off, I would have sworn I was in France!  The decor and ambiance is very French.  I went in to meet someone for coffee and Croissant.  The croissant came fresh out of the oven, so delicate and the coffee was magnificent, perfect! The food that came by our table to other patrons looked and smelled deeeeeeelish as well! The owners and chef were all so gracious and service oriented and most of all, so passionate about what they do.  Their French accents added to the experience, so authentic...wonderful!!!  Truly a little part of France right here in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"What's not amazing about this place?! Great service amazing delicious food.  Owner is a saint and prices a're very affordable. Love the crepes and pretty much anything served!!! There is limited parking for such a plaza bit it's worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"Service needs to improve, as our Orange juices never came out and waiter never followed up to see if we wanted additional coffee, water, etc.

As for food, the omelette was very good and so was the espresso,  but the potatoes seemed old and lacked flavor and the croissants were nothing special to boast about."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for a girls' lunch the other day.  It was absolutely delightful.  The owners were so gracious, the food was delicious and prices very reasonable.  Looking forward to sitting on the patio when the weather is agreeable."}
{"text":"I went to La Petite France Saturday night with my family for the first time (party of 6). I am personally not a huge fan of French cuisine however my experience at La Petite France was nothing short of spectacular! The food was amazing, and the employees were all so warm and inviting. Several times throughout our meal the chef along with the manager and owners came out to check on us to make sure we all enjoyed our food and made sure we had everything. For an appetizer we all shared a bowl of oysters which were wonderful. I had one of their specials the Red Snapper for my entrée. It was perfectly cooked, flakey and flavorful. As for their deserts, they could not have been more perfect, everything was light and very decedent. I could not recommend La Petite France more highly as my family and I are going to become quite regular patrons to this establishment!"}
{"text":"My husband and i were bored of eating asian, mexican, Mediterranean food md were craving for something different. I avoid cheese so always stayed away from French food, but decided to take the risk. Lookedup on Yelp and found this place, it was a little difficult to find the place but that was because we went in the wrong direction. If you look at the mall from scottsdale road it is right there. Food was just Yummmmm. I had the vegetarian crepe and my husband had the chicken pesto. Both of us were so happy with our decision. The staff was veey friendly helped us with the menu, perks of going to a Family Owned Restaurant. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked in amongst a collection of shops. We went in on a Saturday morning and were surprised to see that we were only people there. It worked out because we were able to chat with one of the owners. It was a very pleasant experience and they clearly care about what they do.

Oh, the food was awesome, the Arizona crepe was particularly fantastic. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the food is always top-notch. Yes, the service can be slower than what you might be used to (hence the 4 stars) but tell them up front if you want to move along a little faster and they will accommodate. Authentic French food (I lived in France) but better portions! Try anything - it's all good! The croques are outstanding. I think breakfast here has been overlooked in the reviews - the yummiest potatoes on the planet. Fluffy eggs and croissants that melt in your mouth. Rich, gorgeous coffee although I'd like to see real cream, not the little plastic tubs. This is a perfect Sunday morning place. If you are lucky and there are pastries, grab them! Would love to see more of those but I think they can only do so much. Btw this is a local place and not a chain - another reason to support them! Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"5 stars!!! i have been here twice (once for lunch, once for dinner) and I love it. The food, regardless of what you order, is incredible. The chef Jean Cluade is from south france and he does his people proud. All of the dishes are exquisite, it tastes the way food should taste; with every bite you understand the beauty of flavor. The service is always very friendly and they are super humble and gracious when you compliment them. It is a quaint little place that really reminds me of when i was in france, sweet and sophisticated. I wish I could afford to go there more often."}
{"text":"It was fantastic! We were visiting Scottsdale and found this place by accident. It was so good that we went back the next day for seconds!! The owners and staff were lovely."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for french food and it makes me so sad that we don't have nearly enough french restaurants in Arizona! But, I have to say of the few we have they are all pretty good....and I enjoyed my experience here as well!
A petite cozy place, tucked away, and a perfect place for me and hubby to get away....food is great for the price, and portions are very appropriate!!! 
I hate to comment on service of any resturant because, i don't think that one server's interaction should really summarize the feel of a resturant, and besides i'm not the easiest customer and very particular about food, eating manners, and service timing, so you be the judge....
I will definitely go back, because the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We just returned from a fantastic evening at La Petite France.  The owners, Samir & Joanne, organized a wonderful surprise birthday party for our daughter.  They took care of everything, from the menu, to the decorations, and drinks.  Their incredible warmth and hospitality made it a truly memorable evening for all the guests.   It feels like a little piece of the best part of Paris right in the middle of Scottsdale.

The food is great.  We sampled virtually everything on their menu, and our favorites were the Crepe Elysee and the Vegetarian Tarte Flambe.   Joanne is a talented pastry chef, and the lemon tart was the best I've ever tasted, even in France.   The wine menu is small but well chosen with a good selection of French wines.  

All in all, a very nice experience.  We highly recommend this bistro."}
{"text":"Came back to La Petite France twice after my initial visit, and both times were for crepes. I'm giving it one more star just for the delicious savory and dessert crepes!  Although service is consistently slow (compare to many other restaurants), I kinda respect it now that they are French, and why rush when you have the time to enjoy a nice meal :) So if you are busy with a limited time for a meal, just don't even bother to come!"}
{"text":"Yes, the restaurant is rather small. Yes, there is only one waiter to serve you. Yes, sometimes orders get mixed up before finding their table. But you know what? It`s okay. Everything will work itself out.

Even coming during one of their busiest times of the year (the dreaded 'Licious time for most restaurants), the food is great, and the service, while harried, is honest. 
The restaurant is small, so even with a reservation, be prepared to wait 5 - 10 minutes for your table during busy times. 

Leave time to find parking. While there is street parking right in front, and another small group of spots on the side street nearby, there are quite a few restaurants in the area, as well as a group of office buildings across the street. In a pinch, there is a Green P lot further east on Bloor."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been back since my last review and my experience simply gets better and better every time.  The owner is a wonderful Frenchwomen and the chef a Frenchman.  The chef explained  how he makes everything (and I mean everything) from scratch.  It simply makes the difference.  

Last night, we ordered the escargot (wow!), French Onion soup, the Crepe Provencal followed by a wonderful mouse based pastry for dessert.  

What I love about this place is the value.  Not only is everything made from scratch, it is authentic French cuisine.  A few places around the valley call themselves French, but they aren't. This place is the most authentic in the valley and the prices!! wow the prices are phenomenal!  It isn't cheap but it isn't expensive given the ingredients they use and the time it takes to make everything from scratch.  

By far my very restaurant in the valley; I shall be back many times.  

BTW, the brunch here is amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a remarkable dinner.  Like getting away. Gastronomique extraordinaire. From wonderful wine and cheese selections, to pastries, with coq au vin in between!  The service and music selections made our evening perfect.  We do not prefer to go to a chain.  And this restaurant is why.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Google Maps might direct you to the wrong part of this complex (they're actually in behind Starbucks) but this restaurant is well worth seeking out! The wait staff was very pleasant and helpful. The food was delicious. We left with food in hand (portions were large) from Sunday brunch and are already planning our next visit for dinner. My wife and I are so happy to have discovered this French gem."}
{"text":"If there were a sixth star, La Petite France would have earned it!  Excellent food and excellent service!  This gem  is my very favorite dining spot since moving to Arizona three years ago.  My sister and I both had the Savoyarde crepe with crème fraîche, onions, potatoes,bacon, blue cheese, chives.  It was magnificent! Tender handmade crepe and the veggies were perfectly cooked.  French music and the impeccable attention to detail makes you feel like you are in Paris.  

The owners are highly customer focused and their customers are pampered.  We had to try the desserts..I had the banana split crepe with vanilla ice cream, it was extraordinary!!  My sister had the bread pudding which she said was rich without being too sweet, a fabulous dessert that she would highly recommend.  There was no room for another morsel, but we were captivated by the outstanding array of beautiful macaroons and got a dozen to go!  

Everything here is made by hand and is of the  highest quality, using fresh ingredients and is worth every penny!  The dining experience is casual and relaxing.  Can't wait to come back to sample the other wonderful offerings!"}
{"text":"3.5 for me but likely a 5 from my hubby as his hot chocolate crepe was trés bien magnifico and the best he's had yet in the states so far even beating out Jean Philippes in LV. 
On this gorgeous spring day in Jan we ventured out to try a bistro we've bookmarked for a while now and only managed to arrived an hour before breakfast/lunch session ends. I was craving a scrumptious quiche but lo and behold all out. Not sure why there were no pastries in the pastry display either but I doubt it could have been due to a sellout crowd hours before us. Place was empty sans another solo table when we got there but we were surprisingly greeted by new AZ transplant from Paris, Samir the chef's brother who was a lovely chap.
But back to the food I ordered a Parisien hot dog ala croque monsieur style and talk about volume! It was a huge baguette sliced in half topped with a nice wiener mustard and melted swiss cheese and a side green salad. The baguette had a lovely scratch made flavor which surprisingly brought me back to bistro menus in Paris.
As I mentioned I would suggest you head here on a day that had a better selection and I look forward to any pastries which we seemed to have not had the fortune to partake today. C'est la vie!"}
{"text":"This rating is due to the inability of yelp giving half stars. It should have been 3 1/2 stars.

After reading all the reviews and knowing that most of the complaints were around service and how they dress I decided to give it a try as I was going to be in the neighborhood. 

The service was good. Cannot conplain. The waitress got us a table right away, explained the specials, and asked what we wanted to drink. We order our dinner and wine and the bread came soon after (and it was replenished - and so was our water).

I had a steak and frites that was tasty but no frills (no jus, no shallots). The guy in the kitchen understands what medium rare should be. My boyfriend had a rabitt with dijon sauce and it was delicious. We shared the creme brulé for dessert. Yummy but as others said, not the best I had. 

The food was tasty. Simple buy well executed. I would come back. The bill for two was under 70$. They have a winterlicious menu for 25$. I think it is worth a try."}
{"text":"La Petite France is a homely, small french cafe with a nice outdoor patio. I started with the onion soup which was very different from any other onion soup I have had before. It was light and had a slight sour taste to it. I then had the special which was mussels and frites, both which were well seasoned with garlic and herbs. For dessert I had the creme brûlée which unfortunately the glaze was over torched and on the burnt side."}
{"text":"We had a great time. The summerlicious menu is worth every penny! $25 for a 3 course meal. We were a party of 6 and we had everything from the menu. All dishes were very good. I recommend the tilapia that was amazing and the prifiterol. The stuff very friendly and professional. Enjoy! We definitely did!"}
{"text":"We had heard that after the change of ownership that this improved greatly. We never tried it before, but thought we would give it a shot. We tried the continental breakfast and the mushroom spinach quiche. We were disappointed in both. The continental breakfast comes with a croissant that was too doughy and the crepe omelet was mediocre.  The quiche had good flavor, but was the dough was still raw which spoiled the taste. Hopefully, they get their act together over time because it is a very cute place with a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Our first night in Scottsdale, we searched Yelp for a place to have dinner, and luckily found this wonderful place that was so great we went back the next day for brunch.  The owners are gracious and welcoming, the house wine delicious, and we loved every dish we ordered.  We are looking forward to going back for lunch today!"}
{"text":"An undiscovered gem. With the waitstaff nearly all related to the owner, it's clearly NOT what you would normally find near several hotel resorts. Menu and wine selection is narrow, but everything tried on the menu (75 percent of the offerings), were excellent. And, they are really French, so this isn't some make-believe French restaurant. It's real. Make the effort to get here while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It was Mother's Day, and It was the perfect afternoon for al fresco dining at La Petite France Bistro. 

As usual, I perused the menu on line to help me make a quick decision in advance about what I would order. They had a special three-course menu for Mother's Day, but you could still order off the regular menu. The special menu did not have crepes, and that was why I so wanted to go. I made a reservation and specifically asked for outside dining. I was \"un petit peu\" flummoxed when we arrived, and they had already seated our friends inside. I asked politely if we could sit outside and reminded the gentleman that when I made the reservation, he asked me if I wanted indoor or outdoor seating. After reminding me that they would have the misters on if it was very hot, I said, outdoor then. After waiting about five minutes for them to set up, we were seated outside on the lovely patio. The tables were set beautifully with white tablecloths, golden yellow colored napkins, and faux rose petals of various shades of pink and red. 

It took some time for the waiter to get to our table for ordering drinks, meals, desserts, etc. He was a darling young man originally from Germany (I was surprised he was not French)! He explained that based on reservations, they didn't think they would be so busy so they staffed accordingly. I have to admit that we were all quite pleased that we weren't rushed through our meal and had the chance to linger and enjoy the food and the beautiful atmosphere. I don't know if giving us time would be considered usual practice. 

The food . . . the menu had so many delicious sounding items, even more that I remembered from the on line menu . . . From Flammelcueche (a rectangular shaped Neapolitan like pizza dish that comes on a pizza board straight from the oven) to croissants to crepes to salads, as I watched orders come out of the kitchen, I had a difficult time making a decision . . . I think anything would have been a great choice! My husband and our friend had the Hawaiian Crepes which were creamy, lite, but still filling. My crepes Provencal were reminiscent of the crepes I had in Versailles at a famous little creperie with goat cheese, vegetables and eggs. Our other friend had the La Pacific quiche with smoked salmon, cream cheese, dill and capers. It was a gorgeous mini quiche, not a slice from a large pie. We were all very pleased. Each entree came with a side salad with homemade dressings. I had the orange vinaigrette and it was so fresh and flavorful. Hubby had the Honey Raspberry that also was so light and delicious. 

The piece de resistance was the dessert crepes. Because we had waited so long for our \"Banana Split\" crepe, our waiter comped us a Royal Chocolat -- it was heavenly . . . with a crispy hazelnut bottom topped with a chocolate mousse cake. After devouring that, we didn't need the Banana Split crepe, even sharing among the four of us, but ohhh, I wouldn't have missed it for the world! I rarely order desserts out, but this was an absolute must . . . the warmth of the freshly made thin crepe with the coolness of the vanilla ice cream, accompanied with banana, strawberries, caramel, chocolate, butter, coconut and fresh whipped cream, it was completely sinful and worth every calorie! 

This particular day, I felt transported back to the little creperie in Versailles. Okay, so we weren't surrounded by centuries old buildings . . . but our stomachs felt like we were! Bon appetit!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and I look forward to either Saturday or Sunday brunch here! The food is spot on and made with delicate care from a charming couple from the Alsace region, Strausbourg, France.  After living in France for a few years, my husband i wanted a truly authentic place not a faux french-inspired place.
- the flammenkueche gratinee is huge and complexly delicous with a smoky, sweet and flat bread / thin like pizza.
- the pain au chocolat ( chocolate croissant) is from a true french baker and after eating one everymorning , it ranks among the best i have ever had
- the morning breakfast deal for 12$ is amazing: oj, coffee, pain au chocolat, crepe and baguette with jam and butter . .  .
- the crepe varieties a so delicious, you will not be disappointed with any
- dessert / patisserie counter by a pastry chef is GORGEOUS!

Just go, it is in a small part of the Seville shopping mall /plaza and support their charming place.

Note:allot time to eat here, the owner is the waiter and he still is adapting to america's speed for service.  If you have eaten in france, you will understand the timing and enjoy the time spent with your company.  Forget about service expedience and just enjoy your wonderful food and trust me it will beat your faux french experiences hands down."}
{"text":"Just found finished Mother's Day brunch here. Another 5-star meal.  Smoked salmon crepes, croissant with eggs/bacon, and Nutella crepes. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Classic French restaurant actually run by French people. I had the rack of lamb in dijon mustard and it was quite good and done as I requested (medium rare) . The plates were incredibly hot insuring the food stays hot right through the meal! They were able to substitute rice for mashed potatoes which was quite fine. The carrots were over cooked for my liking. The wine list was ok, but could be expanded with more by the glass or 1/2 litre or have half bottles. In today's alcohol hostile driving environment only offering most by the bottle is getting old real fast. Expect typical French hospitality ... And I mean French French not Quebecois :)"}
{"text":"Today I had a delicious lunch and an amazing Flammekueche, the Smoked Salmon was authentic . My pumpkin soup was rich and creamy. The crepe Gourmet was outstanding. My glass of Riesling wine reminded me an old great trip to Alsace with my Fiancee.
The staff was so nice and very efficient.
SACKTIME Team"}
{"text":"Seriously awesome. Ask for any dish with the house made \"French fries\" haha! PERFECTION AT ITS FINEST."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to spend our anniversary at a smaller scale restaurant. The day we went was also a miserable wintry day (our anniversary is early February) so decided to stay around her neighborhood on Bloor. Found this place online because it had winterlicious ($25 menu) and gave it a try.

WOW - great decision. Despite the snowstorm the place was pretty full. Which doesn't take long to happen as it is a relatively small restaurant. Decor is simple, nothing fancy, almost like your rural friendly French bistro somewhere in the Bordeaux area. We had a reservation (which helped) and got a small cozy table.

We both had the winterlicious menu with a half litre of pinot noir. I had the liver pate which was out of this world. Creamy and delicious that it warmed my heart on this stormy day. Continued with the steak frites - I would say arguably the best steak frites I ever had. The meat was nicely cooked on the outside and despite the thinness, managed to retain a nice red-pinkish inside for a medium-rare. Just salt and pepper, nothing else to ruin the delicious beef taste. Finished it with the profiterol, an amazing creation with a delicious sauce and a bit of ice-cream.

Loved the experience. Not a big restaurant, but extremely cozy, friendly and surrounded by wonderful people - other clients were nice families enjoying a meal like we were. Really loved it. Service was quick, courteous and prompt.

Despite the extensive food, only paid around $100 for both including the wine, tax and tip. The place may be slighly more expensive if you eat outside of winterlicious (or summerlicious) but the entire ambiance and the amazing quality of the food makes it perfectly worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for after-dinner crepes and coffee the other night. I was thrilled to be greeted by such a friendly and hospitable host and owner-- Samir. He paid attention to all of the details and made sure we were very well taken care of. 

We ordered the Belle-Helene to split, which ended up being more than enough crepe. My fiance and I absolutely loved it. It had pears, cinnamon and honey. It was sweet, but not overpowering or heavy-- the perfect after-dinner dessert. My fiance, who's not the biggest fan of sweets, was blown away-- he absolutely loved it!

My mocha was very good as well. 

I was so worried about this little restaurant when the previous owner left. I was delighted to see that it has been reinvigorated by these new owners. I will be back for breakfast soon-- La Petite France has the most amazing breakfast. 

I'd have to say this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I went today with a french friend that explained the place have new owners; we were 6 adults and 3 babies. They only have 2 high chairs and 1 booster, that was ok. The orders came in different time and mine was the last one, because apparently they got confuse, so I had to eat fast. 
I ordered a crepe with ham, cheese and tomatoes, it was very good though. At the end the waiter came to apologize, he was very kind and explained that they are still in a process of organize everything. I will come back."}
{"text":"after reading review had high expectations, unfortunately not me not my wife was able even finish our crapes, nothing else I can add to that"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places in the city. With a seasonal menu, you can be guaranteed to find something new with each visit. Everytime that we've gone, we've taken our time to eat leisurely and enjoy everything that comes out. Everyone who works there is so friendly and willing to offer up a suggestion if needed. I'd have to say you need to have the creme brulee if you go. Every person we have brough agrees it's the best they've ever had. You'll thank me for this one!"}
{"text":"Had a birthday brunch here for my mom.  We sat on the outdoor patio, which was really nice.  The food was tasty and service was great!  My parents were late, so we had coffee while we waited and the staff was so friendly.  The breakfast potatoes were so good and unique, kind of like regular french fries, but not.  Hard to explain, but very good.  The croissants were delicious and the kids gobbled them up! 

We do not live very close, so probably won't go back unless we happen to be in the area, but a very cute place for a special occassion!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, I got the French onion soup which was served bubbling hot, fresh out of the oven and it was delicious.  Also tried the chicken breast sandwich with bacon and pesto served with a side salad.  Everything was fresh and very tasty but the absolute best thing was the dessert!  I had the strawberry banana nutella crepe and it was to die for!  This is a charming and cozy place with excellent and friendly service so don't miss out!  Prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  We ate brunch on the patio.  My husband ordered the ham and cheese crepe, and loved it.  I had the Quiche Lorraine, which was just as wonderful.  Both were served with a side salad.  For dessert, we ordered the belle-helene crepe (pear, honey, cinnamon, whipped creme) -fabulous!  The service was the best, very personable.  We are so glad we stumbled across La Petite France.  We will definitely be back (soon) and can't wait to explore more of the menu!  C'etait incroyable!"}
{"text":"As part of exploration of restaurant week, I found a wonderful menu submitted by Le Petite France.  I was tempted by the flavors of escargot, lamb chops and the wonderful tarte tartan.  I made a reservation for  5:00 on May 21.  They let us know they were understaffed, so we waited for our water and beverage.  The food  was ordered and took time to come out.;  The escarqot was just okay though the puff pastry was heavy not flakey.  Poorly seasoned as well.  I was happily anticipating my lamb plate, when I was somewhat surprised by my plate.  Two lamb chops with veg de chef .  Lamb chops placed on two each slices of green and red peppers Four tiny onion squares on the side.  I called the manager over to ask why my meat looked so unappetizing. No juices coming from the lamb.  No sauces that the French usually are famous for.  I looked like  it had been roasted the day before and was a left over.  Ugg.  Let us proceed to the tarte tartan,  Usually prepared individually in its  own puff pastry.  This was a few apples over some crust you could get in supermarket pie.  When I asked they said they make it like a pizza pie and cut it like that. No apologies or other staff asked about our meal.  At $33.00  I would have preferred Bistro du luc , or any of  the areas good food.  At one star I overrated it.  Good luck.  Hope your other guests get better food and service."}
{"text":"love the new renovations. same amazing french food. Val, Jeff and the chef are all awesome, lovely people. my official place for quiches & authentic french food. the best part of this place... their macaroons, oh my gosh--- delish."}
{"text":"I had a very unfortunate experience here at La Petite France. I came here for restaurant week and I was really looking forward to my meal after reading all these reviews. I have only traveled in France briefly in my time but it was enough to know that I love French cuisine. Unfortunately I was meet with disappointment while eating here.

After placing a reservation for our meal we arrived early only to find that all of the inside tables were being occupied by two large parties. As compensation we were offered an extremely small and awkward table that is located immediately next to the main entrance of the restaurant or a table on the patio. Given the awkwardness of the remaining in-house table we choose to bear the evening chill and sit outdoors. It was evident that the staff had made a mistake and felt badly for it but they danced around the subject for the remainder of the evening rather than apologize. As the odds would have it I ordered the three smallest dishes on the menu. I could not actually believe how small these plates were. I ordered the Le Panier de Tomatoes Rouge, Escargot, the Scallops, and the Red Fruit Sabayon for dessert (all photos of these can be found above courtesy of Mary F). The only dish of these that was memorable was the escargot. The others were truly lacking in flavor and had nothing to savor.

I paid $40 to be cold and hungry."}
{"text":"We came here for a lovely Sunday brunch and were surprised by the amazing service and fantastic food! It was a little hard to find, but definitely worth every bite! Excellent! I had a crepe with munster cheese bacon and potatoes and my wife had a similar dish but \"pizza\" styled. Its not pizza but in fact a traditional french dish! For dessert we had a pear honey crepe! Absolutely amazing! When we ordered drinks the waiter mentioned they were out of something to make a drink for my wife. He said he could try to substitute it for another ingredient and if it didn't come out we wouldn't be charged. He made himself a smaller portion to try himself before he gave it to me. He said it wasn't  the same but still good! And it was! Best service atmosphere and food! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every time I have eaten here I am transported back to France with every bite. The people are extremely friendly and always willing to give their suggestions. I have never had anything that I have regretted. They make the most amazing crêpes around. If you are in the area you need to make a stop here. You will not be disappointed. Sometimes even if business is slow the owners will come and chat with you. They are also willing to speak French with you if you ask. Today was a warm day but with their amazing terrace seating it wasn't noticeable. They are in an excellent location. You are shielded from the sun and there is most of the time a nice breeze that passes through. They offer complex yet absolutely amazing dishes. This is sure to become one of your most frequented restaurants. We love them and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We went there on Sunday at about noon. The food was ok, nothing special. I ordered Roma (croissant with eggs and fries), it was suprisingly good. The french toas was really bad. It taste bitter. I will give 3 stars for the food -- which is not bad but not good  either, but because the service was REALLY bad I only give this resto 2 stars. The owner should train their kid to be a good server. There was only one other customer and he did not even bother came to our table and take our order. We tried about at least 5 minutes to try to get anybody attention so they can refill the coffee. Definately not going back to the restaurant. I should have been gone to the bakery cafe next to the parking lot instead of going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"So my gf and I thought we would try this place out for lunch.  I had chosen it on a recommendation but didn't really know what to expect.  This place is LEGIT!  The second you walk in with the French music playing and the smells that just surround you, it mimics a Parisian French Bistro quite nicely.  

The food. No words can describe the food.  We shared the Provancale Crepe and Montgmarte and it was absolutely to die for.  The taste and ingredients, just perfection. 

The service is the owner and its a family owned in the Seville shopping center, which makes for nice afternoon shopping to walk off the many delectable calories from lunch.

Desert we got the last crepe on the menu, can't remember what it was called but it had rum and orange and it was quite possibly the best dessert I have ever had. Ever. Anywhere. 

Go. Check it out. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"La Petite France is so quaint and cute!!  It is pretty tucked away in a nice outdoor shopping strip (curse AZ strip malls), which is kind of nice to be off the busy road.  The down side is I am not sure how much impromptu traffic they get, which is why I need to get the word out.  It would be horrible if this place went away.  

I found this La Petite France on a mission for a new brunch spot, some of the central Scottsdale/Old Town Scottsdale places are too packed with poor service and food that is just okay and like anywhere else.  When I saw fresh crepes and chocolate croissants on the menu I had to come check it out.  

Take the effort to find it (many other breakfast options)!  Park your car and basically walk to the middle of the shopping corridor and you will find La Petite France.  

I sat down and was immediately poured a glass of water and they set a full bottle of water on the table for me.  I was informed of the daily specials, which all sounded quite delicious.  I ended up opting for the croissant plate with coffee.  MMMMMmmmmmm I was not disappointed; the croissants were so buttery and flaky!!  Get the chocolate croissant.

A friend of mine happened to be walking by on a weekend walk, so I invited her to join me.  It turns out my server was the owner and he told us all about new changes happening with the menu.  They have an actual French chef, meaning he is from France.  The staff is outstanding: very nice, professional, yet amazingly 'neighborhoody' for a Scottsdale restaurant.  

Review #2:  Before I finished my review draft I came back to LPF!  That is a testament to how great this place is in my book.  The owner told me about the mussels when he was talking about the menu at my breakfast visit, so Friday instead of happy hour with my girl Kristen, we decided on wine and mussels.  La Petite France can do mussels 3 different ways...we opted for the traditional white wine, garlic, etc.  We wanted to lick the bowl clean!!! The bread is house made and fantastic!  The mussels were of course good, but it was the 'broth' around the mussels that we dipped the bread in that had us drooling.  I am going to have to come back and try the other two mussel dishes.  

Also two tables near us had the Le Filet du Pechuer (serves 2 people), which is basically a soup with various kinds of fish, squid and shellfish that smelled AMAZING as it went by on the cart.  The one table told us we have to come back just for that dish, and said they come here regularly just for it.  Did I mention they have rack of lamb too...looks like I have quite a few trips back to La Petite France in my future!"}
{"text":"I happened to find this restaurant when looking over the list for the Sept 2013  restaurant week. The menu looked really promising and my wife and I were not disappointed. I had the salmon tartar, lime scallops, and the tart tatin. My wife had the goat cheese/bell pepper tart, mango duck, and lemon tart. Everything was really good but the salmon tartar, bell pepper tart, and mango duck really stood out as excellent. I saw a few people getting the rack of lamb and it looked really good as well. About the only thing I was disappointed with was the inability to order from their regular menu. They have a lot of crepe offerings and it would've been nice to order them as well. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"OK, back again... this time we had the Salmon Flammekeuche and our favorite house wine, the Heritages Cotes Du Rhone. Excellent!!!

I really have a hard time with some of the negative comments about this place, especially about the service. We don't come here for the service, we come here for the food. It is wonderful and both times we have come here it has made us want to go back to France for another visit. 

We absolutely love this place. If you are concerned about fast service and expect the owners to understand your English perfectly don't bother coming here. If you have traveled France, enjoyed it and like French food you won't be disappointed. Yes, you may have to remind the waiter if you are missing something and yes, you may have to ask for your check (L'addition, s'il vous plait).

We will return!"}
{"text":"Ah c'est magnifique La Petite France!

La Petite France serves traditional authentic French cuisine. Both the menu and the staff is French, which adds to the atmosphère française. The ambiance of the relatively small space is cozy and the decor is completed with French Art Nouveau prints on the walls.

I've been to La Petite France a couple of times. Although the service is always excellent, some may find it a bit slow. This is what you should expect from an authentic French restaurant. The French LOVE to eat and drink and usually make an event of it. You can easily expect a dinner to last 2 hours. The experience at La Petite France definitely lends itself to that. The courses take their time to make it out to the table, which leaves plenty of time to enjoy some of their delicious wines and engage in some good conversation.

My absolute favourite app are the escargot flambée. They are flambé in a garlic and herb sauce and come out like little tender pieces of meat. I've also tried the patte de grenouille (frog legs), which I found to be a little too dry and bony (no French Frog pun intended :-P ).

There are several meat and fish options on the menu ranging from lamb to veal and beef. I ordered the pepper steak cooked medium and was pleased to find it perfectly cooked served with a creamy sauce loaded with large peppercorns. If you're a raw food lover like me, they also have steak tartare on the menu. It's good, but not the best I've had in the city.

Finally, what better way to complete a French meal than with some crème brulée. La Petite France has the absolute best crème brulée I've had in the city. The crust is thin but firm and the cream is smooth and velvety. 

If you're ever in the mood for French cuisine on the west side, drop by La Petite France. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I never write reviews on here, but unfortunately, this place needed one. Do not believe the five star ratings on here, they are probably people who were paid to write something. My husband and I had were excited to try this place for restaurant week and were sorely disappointed. The meal that we partially ate was not worth even close to the $33 dollars that they charged. The pictures on yelp are also misleading, as everything we had looked NOTHING like what is online. Do yourself a favor and do not eat here. Seriously."}
{"text":"My worries of the sometimes small French portion size was quickly unfounded when the food arrived. The food was excellent. The French onion soup was a super reduction and was even served with a small bowl of extra cheese and slice of bread on the side!  My daughter's Nutella, banana, and chocolate crepe was a dish of gluttony. My sons Hawaiian crepe was an interesting combo of turkey, Brie cheese and pineapple.  I was pleased to see that they didn't skimp on the amount of Brie.  The food was 5 stars, service was 4 stars due to some slowness."}
{"text":"La Petite France was the best meal I've had in a long time! 
I started with the French Onion soup. Lots of onions, good broth and tons of melty cheese = yummy! 
For my entree I couldn't resist more cheese... I had the Steak au Roquefort (blue cheese sauce). It was cooked to perfection (I ordered medium) and the sauce was so creamy and rich. Delicious!! To top it all off... the BEST Creme Brulee i've ever had! And i've definitely had my share of creme brulee in the city and around the world. The brulee is usually my favorite part. Crack crack with the spoon and save the extra thick crisps for last. But the creme, oh the creme! It was so creamy, just melted in my mouth. It was soft and velvety... utter bliss!! 
It's really a good thing that service in French restaurants is slower than normal. The French like to make a whole evening out of a meal. It's an experience, complete with conversation and good company. I would never have been able to stuff myself with all this delicious food if it wasn't for the pauses to digest between courses. 
A lovely two hour dinner."}
{"text":"We came here for desserts and each of us ordered different things.  I got the banana, strawberry Nutella crepe and it was delicious.  Everyone with me loved it. One of my friends got the chocolate eclair and she thought it was just ok. Another friend got the creme Brule and she liked it but wasn't the best she had ever had.  The staff was very friendly and helpful in describing the menu."}
{"text":"Love this quaint little bistro!  We were so glad to see it was still around!  We visit Scottsdale a couple times of year and discovered this gem a year ago. Tonight was our 3rd visit and it was fantastic as always. It is romantic and perfect for a quiet dinner and sipping wine. Everything is great but the dessert crepes are outstanding!  They need more business though. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Have come here twice in a month.  It's a nice cozy place for lunch or dinner.  Service is quick at lunch to cater to the business crowd.  They have a varied menu and daily specials.   I had a nice squash soup for starters the one time.  Steak frites is a popular item at $15 which is quite reasonable.  Had coq au vin on penne for lunch once.  Didn't care for the deconstructed shredded chicken piled onto penne.  The pasta special i had the first time was much better.  Service is attentive.  Would come again for lunch or dinner.  Have not tried their desserts yet!"}
{"text":"La Petite France is a long way from home for an east-ender lke me.  It is a small, rustic and cozy restaurant that boasts authentic French food.

My experience in coming to these local joints that boast authenticity is that you pay for it in lack of plating and presentation.  I guess they really DO keep it real!

I came here with my BFF for Winterlicious.  If you want hip and trendy - go elsewhere.  The crowd at La Petite France were mostly older.

The service was clumsy.  While there were no big mishaps, we had to politely inform the servers (3 times) that they brought us the wrong order.  Third times a charm?

I opted for the Citrus & Honey Mussels Salad which is basically torn up romaine lettuce, with a few mussels scattered on top and  mixed with a citrus viniagrette.  It definitely didn't have any wow factor to it.  

For mains, I ordered the Shallot Steak with Fries.  The steak was okay, it was a thin slice of steak.  The shallot sauce was yummy and I used it to soak up the yummy French fries (which were also yummy sans sauce).

For dessert I decided to try the Crème Brûlée since I saw them scribble on a chalkboard that it was Toronto's best.  Call me a skeptic!

Was it the BEST crème brûlée I've ever had?  I wouldn't say so.  But it was pretty damn good.  The sugar was hard, but not to a level of stained-glass duress.  It had just the right amount of caramelization without having to bring out the heavy artillery to penetrate the layer of sugar.  The actual custard part was pretty standard.

It should be noted that La Petite France is looking to change its name.  And they are asking for their customers for suggestions.

All in all, a satisfying meal for $35.  But I won't clock the extra kilometres just to come here for a meal.  If I were in the neighbourhood I'd probably come back again.  

I would recommend making reservations as it is a pretty small space."}
{"text":"We stopped for dessert and were delighted with our Crepes. Delicious!!!  And the coffee, it almost tasted like French press, so if you like it strong you won't be disappointed... yums.   

It was a quiet night, so we had the whole place to ourselves.  The hostess and waitress were super inviting and welcoming.  

Can't say much about the rest of the menu but man o man, best strawberry/banana/nutella crepe i've had in forever.... pretty gosh darn authentic for sure."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed La Petite France many of times...it soooo reminds of my vacation to Europe trying all of the cute French restaurants. Sadly, life has kept me away for several months until recently I returned. I am very sorry to report the food and my experience was just not the same as my previous visits to this former gem of mine. I was so disappointed in the quality, service and just overall atmosphere of the place, I couldn't believe it was the same restaurant. Willing to give them another try and since eating there always brought back such awesome memories, I decided to try them again and once again I was very let down. Actually I was more let down then the first time... everything about the place was just wrong, I don't know what changed other than the quality, atmosphere, service and vibe but something has happened which the owners need to address before this former gem drifts off into just another bankrupt restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this French Bistro for lunch today. The food was excellent as was the service and friendliness of the owner. We were so impressed that we have invited friends to meet us there for brunch tomorrow !  This is a must restaurant !"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I was very impressed, considering it was my first time, all my expectations were met. Our server was very kind when giving recommendations and patient when we had no idea what some of the stuff on the menu was. Our food came rather quickly, as we came right at the end of the rush.  We had the smoked salmon omelette and the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. Everything was so delicious. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Always great food!!! It doesn't matter what meal, breakfast, lunch or dinner... Phenomenal crepes!! Wonderful atmosphere! The owners are very personable!! Love, love, love this place!! Great gem I wanna keep to myself!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and cannot wait to go back.  If you want very well prepared, high quality food, this is your place.  Everything was superb and amazing.  I highly recommend this place and if we lived in Scottsdale we would be regulars.m"}
{"text":"Made reservations as their website recommended and no need for that. Not sure if it was just an off night but ... My daughter wanted to try French cuisine and so researched quite a few in the valley and liked this menu so decided to try. I was expecting a full house but upon entering through the strip mall where most shops were closed found a quaint little restaurant with 3 other tables with patrons. Older gentleman dining alone, a older couple in our section then a couple in another area. Arrived at 7pm, ordered appetizer of French onion soup and our entrees at the same time. The waiter/probably owner did not ask for our drink order. Soup arrived at 745. At least we had water. Watching the other table I knew we were in for a long dining experience.  The other table received their meals abt 751, they were not happy. The mans steak was well done he ordered rare. Yikes. My daughter ordered frog legs and I ordered scallops and we ordered a ratatouille tarte, all to share. Dinner arrived at 815. Frog legs were decent, great that they were sautéed but a bit over cooked. Scallops were perfect. Came with rice which they should have skipped and put a couple slices of baguette to soak up the wonderful lemon sauce on both dishes. The tarte was still not out by the time we were finished with entrees. But it was well worth the wait. What a wonderful dish. Enough to feed 4 if sharing. Incredible flavors. Dessert was the hot chocolate crepe. Which was delightful. Food was very nice. Service could have been better however as attentive as possible with only 2 people running the restaurant. May or may not go back as I wasn't that impressed overall and one dish out of 5 doesn't draw the 30 minute drive there."}
{"text":"Drove all the way over here and it was closed at noon on a Wednesday.  Hours say 11am to 3pm on yelp.  Annoying when you only have an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"As other reviews have said, La Petite France is a hidden gem in Phoenix. The food is stellar and the atmosphere is friendly. My husband and I make the drive up from Mesa just because the food is so wonderful. 

The Tarte Flambée, both Classic and Vegetarian, is amazing! I am proud of my own quiche recipe, but it pales in comparison to La Petite's quiche. I trust the chef enough to try food that I never would have considered before and have never been disappointed. The wine recommendations are always spot on, no matter what food we order. 

This is the place we bring family when they visit, and the hospitality at La Petite will make anyone feel at home. The owner and the chef truly care for their customers, and get excited to share new dishes with their guests. I love that there's always something new to try. 

Recently we wanted to have a party for 25 friends and the owner and chef worked with us to create the perfect menu for our event. The food was ready before we arrived and it was a huge success. Our friends ooed and ahhed for hours! I highly recommend having La Petite France cater or host a party."}
{"text":"I always appreciate going to restaurants that are solely ran by the owner. I had a wonderful experience years ago at Cafe Monarch and La Petite France in the Scottsdale Seville shopping plaza is no different. Jeff and Valerie work very hard and always deliver top-notch service and food. Their french onion soup is my favorite - I would eat it daily if I could.... and their nutella crepe is to die for!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem of Scottsdale/Phoenix!   A must for anyone looking for great French food or just a charming atmosphere.

The restaurant is located in the courtyard of the Seville Shopping Center.   It's located in the back, behind the parking lot. 

We had dinner on the patio where there is a lighted Eifel Tower. The Eifel Tower adds warmth and charm to the restaurant.  Makes you want to book your next trip to France.

When we sat down we greeted by the owner of the restaurant who is very ingratiating and told us about their specials.  We started with the Escargot and the Brie served with salad.  The appetizers were fantastic! The main courses were exceptional as well.  We ordered the Boeuf Bourguignon, Veal liver and the Chicken roulade.  All the dishes were fantastic!  At the end of the meal we had the opportunity to meet the chef, who is from France!!!  How cool is that!

He told us that he also makes all the desserts.
We were so full at that point but since they were home made we order a few and loved everyone.
You must visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing and a romantic place to take a loved one. Me and my ex girlfriend loved the food and atmosphere 100%"}
{"text":"A HIDDEN GEM OF SCOTTSDALE! located in a court area of the Seville Shopping Center. (no signs to let you know it is there)

Authentic French Bistro dining with real French staff featuring baguettes, crepes,quiches, Flammekueche (French pizzas), crosty (stuffed potatoes) and possibility the VERY BEST DESSERTS in Scottsdale.

The Bistro is quaint and charming with a large patio and the dishes are served on interesting plates. We decided to try crostys for lunch they came with interesting fresh salads served first. My companion had his crosty with sausage, provolone, Parmesan and mine was smoked salmon onions, cream fraiche & dill. Both potatoes came out piping hot and both were ooey gooey with cheese but potatoes were not fluffy and were brown on edges, also I wasn't excepting cheese on the salmon and would ask for no cheese if I ordered this again. So the lunch entree was really about 3 stars on this visit but dessert was on a level so much better I think 4 stars rounds it up.

The STAR of this lunch was the lemon mousse perfection in flavors, texture a perfect mouth feel and design,I have to say this is the VERY BEST mousse I ever had and if I came in for just dessert this would have been FIVE STAR Yelp. The mousse was a cut round in shape topped with a strong  shiny orange under it was the thick layer of intense lemon mousse that wasn't too sweet but perfect and under that was a thinner layer of chocolate mousse that reminded me of pot de creme but wasn't. If you dine near that dessert case you will get hypnotized and fall surrender to one of the many amazing desserts they all looked wonderful.

Service was very charming but clunky. Beverages ordered came after salad water was not refilled and we had to ask for check.

Slight update

Business has been sold to a new French Owners recently."}
{"text":"We discovered this gem when we walked around after a visit to the Railroad Park across the street and just had to give it a try. We've been at La Petite France twice now and both times the food and service were fantastic. I could sit all day and have croissants and French tarting with butter and jelly. We have had the Continental Breakfast which includes a ridiculous amount of wonderful food, including a choice of omelette, Croque Monsieur, and fruit. We always want to order more, but are too full. We intend to come back until we have worked our way through the entire menu - breakfast, lunch, and dinner! This is the best French food we have tasted outside of Frqnce.  Go with a coupons on Wednesday night and share a Tarte Flambee, a mixed salad and two glasses of wine for $25. I think this place should be packed but we have never had to wait.  Make sure to try La Petite France the next time you are looking for an authentic taste of France."}
{"text":"You have to look for it but when you find it, La Petite France is a wonderful place to eat.  I was traveling alone for work when I found La Petite France in the middle of a retail center at Indian Bend/Scottsdale road.  

At first I was going to order a Crepes, but then I saw Flammekueche on the menu!  I have never seen Flammekueche here the states and love having it when in France.  I ordered the Classical and loved it.  

In addition, I saved room for a dessert crepe.  It was wonderful.

The owner is very friendly and I hope I make it back to Scottsdale soon because I want to try a few other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I ate here today, overwhelmed by the experience - it was just that good.
Service, food quality, atmosphere, presentation, all wonderful.

After being seated, the waiter brought a gratis shot of porto and a small appetizer; melon wrapped in a porto-infused prosciutto. It was a triumph! 
My baguette was amazing as was my wife's crepe, and our dessert, the creme brulee,was off the chart.
This was one of those meals that lingers in both your mouth and your brain long after dining.

My wife and I still discuss this little dining gem, likening it to a blockbuster movie that's so well made, you just can't stop talking about it. 

I told the server when we left; \"We didn't have food anywhere in France.\"

If you're in a mood for French, it doesn't get any better for your money."}
{"text":"After visiting Paris, I came to the conclusion that I would probably never find affordable, authentic French food in the US, especially Arizona! But I think la petit France is just that!! I was so excited to try their food and meet their staff. We were greeted by the owners and chef. It was wonderful talking to them about their new business and how it all came to be. It made our dinner so fun and we appreciated the food even more. So now on to the food. Delicious!! We started with warm Brie which was to die for. Then we each had a different crepe. I had la Provence which was salmon capers and onions. Yum yum and yum. It was big and I had to take it home. Then I ordered macaroons and have never tasted a better one. The chef created so many different flavors and each one so delicate and delicious. I took home a dozen! It was the perfect dining experience. Thank you! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lovely French restaurant in the Seville Shopping Center across from the McCormick Railway park.  We passed by this place a week prior not realizing it was open.  It was a Friday night.  The French onion soup was delicious as was the brie en croute with spring salad.  Beef bourguignon was very flavorful and my son had a salmon crepe and a chocolate dessert crepe.  I had the creme brulee with a hint of anisette.  The host, Geoff (or could be Jeff :)  was very nice and we got to meet the chef, JP. who apparently makes all the pastries.  We weren't rushed as we've sometimes felt in other restaurants.  It was a very relaxing, enjoyable meal.  I will definitely bring my family from Europe here when they visit."}
{"text":"Really great crepes and service. Location is a little hidden but worth tracking it down for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!!! We couldn't get in during restaurant week but tried a few weeks later and were seated right away. Surprisingly we were only one of two tables seated while we were there on a Friday night. The boeuf bourguignon was fabulous and the hot chocolate crepe for desert was so good I ordered a second!!"}
{"text":"IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HERE SINCE THE NEW OWNER AND CHEF TOOK OVER, TRY IT AGAIN, IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLACE!!  We ate here once 4-5 months ago and were just so-so on it:  the food was good, but the service was painfully slow.  Then maybe 2 months ago we did a double-date with some friends who wanted to try it, and by strange luck we showed up on the day the new owner took over.  BOOM!  It was so much better!  We have now been back at least a half dozen times.  We've done dinners, breakfasts, or sometimes just a quick stop for a coffee and crepe or croissant.  Every time we walk away amazed!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed... Me and my friend went there for the summerlicious menu. The service was slow and food was underwhelming. Even thought the dinner was $25/person, we still pretty upset about the plating and the quality of the food we ordered that night. We expected a better experience since we read so much good reviews from online. Overall, it was not a pleasant dinner and I don't think I will come back for another dinner."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place is really a find off the beaten path.  Family owned and lots of charm at a great price.

I've been here three times for breakfast and can't wait to come back.  My favorites are the provencal omelette and the chocolate croissants."}
{"text":"Delicious- the crepes are wonderful, especially the dessert choices! We also enjoyed the cold sandwiches which were on soft French Bread, they could easily feed two people. Nice patio also!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch and the food had amazing flavor and was simply delicious. 
We will definitely go back again to try their dinner menu. Truly a hidden gem. Like they say in french \"tout simplement fantastique\"."}
{"text":"How cute is this bistro! I absolutely love this place! Went to La Petite France with some girlfriends who wanted to celebrate my 40th birthday, and was very thrilled this was the place that was picked, have been wanting to try them for a while now!

When we got their we were greeted with a friendly warm welcomed and showed to our table. The place inside is just so cute! I love the Paris Clock next the coffee maker.

I ordered the La Jardiniere (spinach & mushroom quiches) and was exactly how I expected it to be. Light, fluffy, and very very tastly! The dough was amazing, come to find out, they make their own dough by hand and everything is cooked in a brick oven. My friends ordered the Vegetarienne Tarte Flambees, which was loaded with crème fresh, fresh tasting veggies and cheese, and that too was amazing. The food was c'est magnifique! Also had a Carmel Café, which was devine! Loved it!

Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu! One for sure is the crème brulee!! It's one of my favorite desserts!"}
{"text":"I came here for a Saturday night dinner with V and L.  V and I had a hard time locating the place.  We drove around the corner not knowing the place was inside the plaza so you can't see if from the parking lot.  HA!  

We loved the feel to the place.  It is small but just cute!  The server was totally helpful and funny.  We ordered:
La Classique Tartes Flambees - crème fraîche, onions, bacon, cheese:  YUM!

Notre-dame Wood Oven Pizza - prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, onions, 
crème fraîche, pesto:  Pretty good!

Chicken, Bacon, Mozzarella Pizza: WHOA, greatness!!!

Dessert:
Crêpe hot chocolate:  NEED TO GET
Crème brulee chocolate flavored:  GOODNESS
Crêpe nutella:  Was good, but the hot chocolate kicked butt!!!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful find in Scottsdale.  The tarts and vichyssoise was the best.  The banana split crepe was the perfect end to a fine meal.  The owner and chef were so gracious and attentive.  Will be coming here again soon. Merci"}
{"text":"La Petite is owned by hard-working husband and wife team from France. The food is wonderful and the restaurant reminds me of something you would find in Europe. Unfortunately the service was REALLY lacking.

My partner had been lusting over French food since he saw a re-run of Julie & Julia on TV. After reading the glowing review in Phoenix Magazine off to La Petite we were.

It was an average, but busy Wednesday night. We were greeted and seated promptly. The server took our drink orders and came back shortly to get our food order. We both decided on French Onion Soup and wanted to take our time with the dinner order. 

When our soups arrived we ordered dinner. I chose Choucroute Royale and he had the Boeuf Bourguignon A L'Ancienne. Dinner came in a reasonable amount of time and the food was delicious! Then the service stopped....

Our server never came back to check to see if the food was to our liking, which it was. We were never offered the opportunity to order additional drinks and we had to ask the bus person to see the menu for dessert options. After about 30 minutes of staring at the wonderful dessert choices our server finally comes by and offers to take our order. By that time we both just wanted to leave and asked for the check. My partner was sorely disappointed, but really did like the food. The slow service didn't happen just to us, it was a common theme for all the tables in our area of the restaurant throughout the night.

In Europe people typically take longer for meals and don't rush in and out like we do here in the US and I appreciate that. In fact, we wanted to take our time with dinner. We just would have liked a little attention after dinner was served.

Will we go back? Definitely, but I hope they improve their service. Based on the other reviews I read we weren't the only ones to encounter this issue."}
{"text":"I have been here twice -- once for dinner and once for lunch. Service was a bit on the slower side, but knowing that it's operated by small number of people, it's reasonable.

I just LOVE hearing them speaking in French.  It'll make you feel like you are in France!!   Everything I tried was very tasty, but let me remind you -- this is a French food after all.  So, it's on the heavy side with cheese and everything else.  A little bit of food will fill you up rather quickly and their portion size is very generous.  Unless you are ready to take some leftover home, think twice before you order."}
{"text":"What a great experience for breakfast!  We'll be back for French Onion Soup, maybe Beef Bourguignon.  The french toast was terrific -- fruit was extremely generous, I had a strawberry slice in every bite.  Just enough whipped cream, not too much.  SO had the quiche, it too was fantastic.  Coffee was also tasty, only thing preventing 5 stars is we're used to fresh cream or half and half at places of this caliber, got the room temperature stable stuff instead.  Place was very quiet, lots of natural light, staff very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I ate here last night.  Overall I had a good experience.  Despite it being in the middle of summer the outdoor seating was comfortable.  Dogs are allowed outside and the waiter (possible owner) is as french as can get it.  He was very attentive to us and even the 2 dogs we brought along.  We ordered a variety of things including the flammkueche (big & tasty), veggie quiesce (I've had better), and crepes (delicious).  Overall the price was OK and our experience was good despite me feeling like they put the gas in gastronome."}
{"text":"This is a review of my Summerlicious experience from some months ago which I've been meaning to get around to, so here we go.

Me and my S/O made reservations to come here thinking it was probably some sort of hidden gem; not very popular, but great reviews nonetheless for its authentic French cuisine. Upon arrival, we entered our very small resto with the main age demographic pushing near 70. That was okay though since we were there for the food, senior citizens cafeteria vibes be damned!  Well, the food itself was average at best - we both started with a mussel salad (puny), I got the quiche (meh), and finished with a flan cake (had better at Portuguese bakeries). Perhaps I'm not the best judge on what qualifies as \"authentic\" French food, but if it's anything like LPF then I'm not a fan.
The service wasn't any better; there was only one waiter working the floor and despite being rather empty on that afternoon, he frequently got our orders mixed up with the table beside us. He seemed pretty uninterested the entire time, which just compounded our already lackluster dining experience.
Overall, boring food and tepid service/hospitality for our Summerlicious experience, how it still attracts business is beyond me."}
{"text":"Worth stopping by!! It is hidden in the plaza behind the famous coffee place. 

Quiche La Parisienne for me. A way a quiche should be served and not as part of a bigger pie. Most of their creations come with a yellowish butter and garden salad with a variety of dressings.

My friend had the crepe that had salmon. YUM!!!

All together I was satisfied. Brush up your basic french and get to accept or even order a la parisienne!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday morning in a group of six people. Food was excellent!!!
I got the Tartes Flambées (Vegetarienne).
Everything was homemade with fresh ingredients. I can't say enough how impressed all of us were with the food. Also, the portion size was enormous (we ended up with tons of leftovers).
Minus one star for the service which was a little bit iffy. But I'll give them a little break because we had a group of six people and this place is just a small cafe. The servers were incredibly nice people, but we had to ask them to provide menus, silverware, and they never noticed a need for refills.
Will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"I just work across the street so some of the girls and I decided to check it out for our Christmas lunch.  It's got such a great vibe - classic French food, French music playing in the background, cozy atmosphere and lots of great French wine. 

I had the shrimp and scallop curry; the fish was so fresh and it was like no other curry I'd every tasted - so gourmet!  Like most French food, it was very rich - I couldn't eat anything until 10pm that night.  Little on the pricy side though; my meal (with sparkling water + tip) came to almost $40 for lunch.

We were all really impressed and would definitely go back - great for a date night!"}
{"text":"Your only excuse for not going here immediately is that they don't have their liquor license yet, but hopefully by March 19.  The patio, the waiters, and the chef are all delightful, though the latter speaks little English.  Almost all food items are under $10 with salad.  The dinner crepes are the best I've had in Scottsdale.  If crepes aren't your thing, try the Flammelcueche (like a thin-crust pizza).  I recommend the classical.  If that's too much for you to eat, try the quiche, or the baguettes, or the croques tartines, or the sandwiches or the salads.  Or eat completely out of the box with a crosty (stuffed baked potato)."}
{"text":"Me and a friends came for a taste of traditional French cuisine and it was as they say as good as it gets.  The place is quaint and cozy, service was professional and friendly. I quietly enjoyed the beef bourguignon and only expressed how good it was until I was done (I didn't want to share!), the food was very \"clean\" as in non greasy (many places over do it). We also enjoyed some good wines by the glass and for dessert we enjoyed the creme brûlée which was slated to be the \"best in the city!\" which I found to be just perfectly done, not too sweet, the top layer easily crumbled and it disappeared from the  plate pretty fast!  Definitely can't go wrong here, will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"If I could turn back time and not have gone to La Petite France Bistro...I would.  It was terrible.  From the slow service to the iced tea that wasn't ice tea...and the waiter not even noticing no one at our table drank it...to the sick feeling I had after the meal:(
The smoked salmon crepes were not edible.  They were salty and sickly fishy.  We hid them under the blob of lettuce they call a salad.  We also got their version of a pizza...it was at least palatable...but not worth bringing the left overs home.  Also, we had a Quiche Lorraine.  I felt like I was eating hospital food.  Again, we could eat it but it wasn't very good.  We wanted dessert...but I was scared to try anything further.  

We had just had two great crepe experiences while traveling in San Fran and were looking forward to this.  I'm sorry to write this review as I think it is a individual owner trying to make a go of things...but I think this place needs to revamp before it becomes a casuality.  I only think it is fair to warn others so no one else wastes time, money and calories on this joint."}
{"text":"La Petite France was good, but not great.  We tried a wide and assorted sampling of the menu and yes, the flammenkueche was very good, but everything else from food to service to atmosphere was just 3 stars in my opinion.  Please spare me the \"you just don't get it\" comments.  I won't be back to give them another try sadly, but if you go be sure to avoid that chicken panini!"}
{"text":"A bunch of Yelpers and I were craving for something sweet after attending Irene's UYE at Cuttlefish yesterday.  Chez Vous, across the parking lot, was closed, so Linda and I thought La Petite France was another great option.  We initially thought there were five of us going, but one couple didn't appear...

Linda had mentioned last year that LPF had changed owners, so I was glad to see that Val (co-owner) was still there!  (I suppose Linda's last visit was before I had started going there.)  On to the food... I decided to go with a past breakfast choice of mine, the $8.95 Hot chocolate (\"sugar, butter, chocolate, cinnamon\"), which Yelp friend Judy F. had suggested in her review.  While last night's crepe was d'lish, it wasn't as good as I had remembered to be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-petite-france-scottsdale?select=1CMIghOEB95KYwUxjrg8AA#1CMIghOEB95KYwUxjrg8AA  I think it was the addition of whip cream, which I normally would have requested to be left out.  (I forgot to ask if the crepe came with whip.)  Last night's dish also had more chocolate syrup on it.  Linda's choice, on the other had, was so delicious!  She had the $9.95 Suzette Flambee (\"butter, sugar, honey and rum, vanilla ice cream, whipping cream\"), which was set on fire, complete with the lights very briefly turned off.  The dish was still afire when the lights came back on, so it wasn't quite as romantic a notion as it could've been...  The rum-laced ice cream was the star of the show, I thought.  A must-order-again, for sure!  :)"}
{"text":"My friend Vickie was visiting from Denver and I wanted to go some place new for breakfast after our 8 a.m. massage on Black Friday.  I had read about La Petite France and thought it sounded good.
It is tucked inside the Seville shopping center, so you have to park and find your way inside.  Very nice patio but it was a bit too cold to sit outside.
We ordered  the $12 breakfast which includes coffee, juice or fruit, french bread and choice of omelet (with a croissant) + small salad.  I'm not sure if it's included but we had gotten a croissant, so we each ended up with two.  I chose the ham/bacon omelet & fruit (I'll post pictures) and my friend chose the OJ with the vegetarian omelet.  They accommodated her choice of cheese and egg whites.
The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star is that they do not serve champagne by the glass.  If they could figure out that people enjoy a glass or two of champagne with their breakfast on weekends or days off, they would make many happy and more $$ for them.
Having traveled to France, I see why others posted about  the service.  This is a traditional French Bistro (with slow service) and authentic French servers.  So if you are willing to wait (or have to call your server vs. waiting), then I think you will definitely enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere, friendly owner, TASTY food. Great for a quiet get-together or a romantic dinner.

The prices are a bit steep for entrees. I think a $$$ price rating would be more appropriate. We were hoping to spend up to 15$ per entree and most of them were in the 20-30 range. There are some options for crepes around 12-15$ though. Bottom line: price can come as an unpleasant surprise. 

Another thing is not so much of a critique but a suggestion: owner was very nice by taking plenty of time to explain the menu to us and then coming to our table to check how we're doing which is very sweet but a bit too much attention. 

Overall, a pleasant place which I'll recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Not quite what I had expected based on rave reviews.. I guess the atmosphere was surprising. The waitress was wearing very casual clothing and there were literally boxes of tables stacked in the corner. 
But not to complain about the food because it was not bad. I had the escargots to start which were so garlicky they were almost spicy. Delicious but not served with anything to sop up the lovely juices and break up the strong flavour, but I asked for more of the bread we had to start and the waitress brought some. I had the shrimp and scallop curry which was quite nice and my friend had the beef bourgignon. Only problem is that my friend does not eat pork and there was almost as much bacon as there was beef in her stew. For dessert, she had a raspberry sorbet which was great and I had the lemon tart. Large portion but I personally wasn't a fan of the crust and thought it should have been more lemony.
Overall, it was a nice experience to try a new place but it won't go on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Food was a 4 but service was a 2. And just weird. I've been to Paris and had slow European service, which I don't mind, but I've never had dishes come at completely different times. I went with a party of 4 and we all ordered at the same time- two eggs Benedict on croissants, one smoked salmon brioche, and a crepe Provençale. Five minutes later, the salmon brioche and the side salad for the crepe came out. About 8 minutes after that, the two
Benedicts came out on toast (not croissants) and 8 minutes after that the crepe arrived.  Food was great, but it was very awkward to have one person sitting without food for so long and not a word of apology from the server/owner (who brought a bite size croissant to make up for the mistake on"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant tucked away in the Seville shops. All wait staff and the chef (yes, the chef came to see how our food was!) was extremely friendly. House salad with homemade French dressing was superb, as were the frog legs and lamb medallions we ordered for entrees. The crepe belle-helene with pears, cinnamon and honey was a perfect ending to the meal. Will be back here more often for sure, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic French experience. Also, beautiful pastries, especially if you come on the weekend :)"}
{"text":"Aggie and I wanted to try some French cuisine, and this place came up in our search.  This is a well hidden gem behind Starbucks and Jamba Juice.  

We ordered escargot (us), frog legs(me), Beef Bourguignon (her), Tarte Flambee, and french onion soup. 

The escargot was great.  It was very tasty, and the subtle spices made it one of my favorite appetizers.  They come in a ceramic dish that holds a single escargot in a dimple.  5 dimples = 5 cooked snails.

The French onion soup had a thick layer of cheese.  That was very good, and it was oh so tasty.  I would highly recommend it.

The frog legs was seasoned with olive oil and thyme.  They were very succulent and tasty.  I will definitely have them again.

The Tarte Flambee was ginormous but very tasty.  Its size is about the size of a large pizza.  

The Beef Bourguignon was succulent and it came with four carrots and some quinoa (seasoned with olive oil and thyme).  Twas a great dish.  She finished every bit. 

It was a great experience, and it is nice to have an authentic French restaurant in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for a 3-course Summerlicious dinner just now and it was really very good--couldn't believe it was $25 per person. I loved our server--no affectations, no cajolery, just a refreshingly genuine warm civility and, we thought, elegance in her spare interaction with us. (I'm not a fan of having to attend to servers' personalities and exertions when I'm out. I noticed other raters complained about the \"cold\" service here. This is not the place to go for tacky blandishments, no.)  French music plays softly and the decor, like the service, is elegantly spare. 

We each tried different items from the menu. For the first course we had the vichyssoise, a lovely, light cold soup with a brighter leek flavour than we've had elsewhere, and the Caesar salad whose dressing was light in consistency and rich in flavour--we loved both of these dishes. 

For the main we had steak with frites--perfectly cooked steak, smoky, tender with just okay fries--and Boeuf Bourguignon, also perfectly tender, braised in a thick, rich wine stew (in fact I wouldn't consider this dish itself a stew the way it's prepared here; it's a lot of meat drenched in a rich sauce) and this second dish came with steamed vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes, all absolutely delicious with delicate layers of bouquet garni (and a spice I can't place) coming through without interference. We really liked these.

For dessert we had lemon tarte (which I'm never a fan of, not even here) and creme caramel (not creme brulee), whose flavour was unmistakably in the French style and delicious, although I found the consistency unnecessarily dense and stiff--possibly just as a result of my being accustomed to the lighter Argentinian variety of this dessert.

Such a tasteful place and we had a great experience here. We'll return even after Summerlicious ends."}
{"text":"We had dinner here during restaurant week to try it for the first time. The pre-set menu with a 3 course meal was what brought us in, it looked divine online and did not disappoint in person. My date and I each tried something different for an appetizer, entree, and dessert. My main entree of lamb with roasted potatoes was incredible and my dates entree of beef short ribs was just as spectacular. We we absolutely recommend this place for anyone looking for a wonderful meal and atmosphere. The staff was warm and inviting, they took great care of us and recommend a tasteful wine to go with each of our meals. For our date night we loved supporting the local treasure of La Petite France and definitely plan on returning. You can't go wrong with ordering anything from their menu!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for dinner.

La Petite France is as close to an authentic French cafe as you are likely to find in the Southwest.  The cuisine consists primarily of a French version of pizza, with creme fraiche substituted for pizza sauce, crepes, and a small number of traditional French entrees such as Coq Au Van -- these vary from day to day.

The chef is clearly more than competent and most of the menu is delicious.  There are occasional misses.  For example, the snapper was very underseasoned and a bit rubbery (could have been too old).  But a crostini-like appetizer and a dessert crepe were as good as it gets.

La Petite France is the kind of 4 star place that you go back to frequently despite the occasional only-average dishes, not because it's cheap, which it isn't, but because the food is different without being \"experimental\".  

Hints:
1.  They have a $29.95 \"dinner\" consisting of your choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert which is a very large discount.
2.  If the weather is decent, try to get outdoor seating.  The patio does not face a road or shopping center and is quite pleasant."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast after I received Yelp's weekly e-mail Yelp's Crepes Of Wrath!
It's a small French bistro with wonderful food! The croissants were dreamy, both plain & chocolate. The best we had outside of France, so buttery yet light & flaky!! Omelettes were fluffy and tasty, crepe was thin and flavorful. Side salad was fresh with homemade light dressing. Coffee was flavorful and not acidic & our kids enjoyed their chocolate milk. We also bought macaroons to go - vanilla, caramel, choc & mint, passion fruit, lime & lemon - they were divine!!! The price is pretty steep - $ 19.95 for 10 but was worth it. It has new owners who are very friendly & involved in business & chef is French.
Service was friendly, courteous, we did not feel rushed yet we didn't feel that we were waiting for a long time either. Felt just right. French music playing in the background was great - not too low & not too loud.

We loved it! Can't wait to go back, will try dinner next time."}
{"text":"What a rare find! Everything is made from scratch with love! And the owners, Valerie and Jeff are super friendly and obviously love what they do! My new favorite place ~ can't wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"I went in not sure what to expect, I thoroughly impressed. The decor resembles an authentic Côte d'Azur café. The savory crepes were flavorful and appropriately seasoned. The sweet crepes were delicately prepared, with fresh fruits. The syrup wasn't overwhelming. The French chef from Cannes entertained us with stories about his hometown and respectfully entertained dialogue my high school level French. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking an authentic French dining experience. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Very unhappy.  Restaurant week guest and the food was mediocre at best.  $33 per person with food quality at about a $10 level.  I've had better Marsala from the freezer section at the grocery.  People were all very nice but the food was not up to par and the portions were small.  My date and I left hungry.  Tip to owners: If you want repeat guests from restaurant week, step it up a notch and wow your patrons.   We really wanted this place to be good.  Sad."}
{"text":"Hidden - yes.  Treasure - NOT.  After all the rave reviews, I was very disappointed in this place.  While so happy to support a local mom and pop (or shall I say, \"Mama et Papa\"?) establishment, there was really nothing good about it.  The couple, I am sure, are very nice and are trying hard, but the food was just plain bad.
  
The onion soup had too many onions (though a nice flavor), had tasteless cheese on top, and it was not overflowing like it should be.  Plus they add a little extra cold grated cheese on the side, which was even worse.  It was also tasteless and left a film in my mouth.  And what was that extra cold cheese for anyway?   I have never seen this done before anywhere.   

On my companion's ham and cheese crepe, you could not find the cheese, other than the grated cheddar garnish.  Nice Mexican food touch.  Did I just order a burrito?  The crepes were also absolutely tasteless, other than the one dessert crepe that my daughter had which was palpable, but how could it not be smothered in ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce?  I actually left more than half my (provencale) crepe over, and I NEVER leave food over anywhere.  

The place is cute enough and was packed, but the service, or shall I say lack of, was unacceptable.  And the tables are on top of each other to boot.  Again, I appreciate a local spot that is not a chain, but they need to step up the service.  A lot.  And the food.  A lot.  It is time to hire a professional server and stop trying to do everything themselves.  Example: a woman who obviously knows nothing about French food, drops off a terrine type appetizer at our table and leaves.  Even though I can recognize it is a terrine of sorts, I would like to know what is in it.  I call her back and ask her what it is, and she has no clue.  She says she will ask.  She asks the owner and he can barely describe it.  She comes back to say it is a ????.  And she still is not sure.  I overheard him, however, telling her it is a mousse.  I still have no idea what type of mousse.  Would you not think that when she drops it at the table, she should tell you what it is and then say something like, compliments of the chef?  It's a nice gesture, but so poorly executed.  

Then when the owner comes over to take your order, being a rare cuisine in the valley with most people having no clue what anything is, would it not be wise for him to say, do you have any questions, would you like a recommendation, etc.?  Nope, he just walks over and says, \"what would you like?\"  Granted, his English is not proficient, but he could certainly say something more helpful and welcoming.  Then, to make matters worse, he made up our bill incorrectly, by over $7.  Not cool.  He's doing too much obviously and can't do any of it well.  

First and last visit for us.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that I grew up in a French town and continue to eat my way throughout France, so I have to add that I am an experienced French gourmand.  Trust me, if you know French food, you will be disappointed. (and I hate to add that snobby comment, but just could not leave it out, as it really speaks volumes)"}
{"text":"I came here for Restaurant week, so it was $30 for a three course meal. I was really looking forward to this place with all the awesome reviews, but I was met with disappointment. 

The appetizer I chose was Salmon Tartar (Smoke Atlantic Salmon, olive oil, lemon juice, capers, red onion, fresh basil, chantilly with chive, and pita bread.) The raw smoked salmon was okay, but the taste was more subtle for being smoked. The pita bread was... pita bread, which seemed almost stale, so that was disappointing to go with the salmon. 

For my main entree I had the Lime Scallops with risotto Parmesan
(Saute of Scallops including white wine, lime juice, risotto chicken stock, butter, and Parmesan Cheese.) The Scallops were cooked pretty okay, but the risotto was so... soo... unbelievably poor. Unless the risotto was supposed to be crunchy, I don't think it was cooked remotely correct. 

For the dessert, I had Crème brulee (Cream, milk, eggs, rosemary, and fresh fruits). The flavors of the creme brulee was so subtle. and by fresh fruits, it means three shriveled up blueberries and a quarter slice of strawberry. 

After writing this, I kind of want to give it 1 star, but the decor was nice. We had their children waiting on us, which was fine - I\"m just pointing that out. 

I wish I was the type that actually said 'no' when they came by to ask if it was good. But now I just feel unsatisfied paying $40 (with tax and tip) for a meal that I really didn't enjoy.  Oh well."}

{"text":"My boyfriend made a terrible mistake tonight. For our last day during restaurant week we chose this restaurant. This was a poor decision on so many levels. It all started this afternoon when I called to confirm the time of the reservation and pushed it out an hour. The person on the other end sounded like he was 12. I am sure he wasn't but perhaps he wasn't the best person to choose to be the first impression of the restaurant as you walked in the door. He mispronounced the name of the restaurant and was unprofessional. Strike 1. 

We arrived and noticed that the audience on the patio was older. Very much older. We were greeted by said 12 year old and were not even escorted to our table. My guy said he could tell that this was going to be a very slow experience, We were thirsty and anxious and the 12 year old took our food over before even taking our drink order or filling our water glasses. Strike 2.

What else can I say? That the female cook came out and complained that there was a \"rush' with zero people in the dining room and empty tables on the patio service? for the prixe fixe menu - I ordered the escargot, lamb chops and creme brulee. He ordered the shrimp casserole, short ribs and apple tart. While we were waiting for our food we looked around and people were just...not very impressed. The gentleman next to us asked for bread and when the 12 year old told him they don't serve break, the customer retorted with, \"How does a French restaurant not serve bread?\" Strike 3.

The dishes were fine. They were average. They were underwhelming. It's not even worth describing the dishes, they cons definitely outweigh the pros. This \"creme brulee\" was not one at all it was more like a souffle. The short ribs were a less flavorful version of your mom's. We are on strike 23 but whose counting? 

It might sound harsh but why are there no good French restaurants in AZ? Why is it that I have to travel out of AZ to find a decent French meal? Does anyone remember Citrus Cafe in Chandler? I do, it was spectacular. And I have never missed it as much as I do tonight. 

Save your time, money and calories on anything else but La Petite France."}
{"text":"Busy Saturday night!  Only 2 people waiting on people for restaurant week. Service was very slow and the food was tasteless. Very disappointed after hearing so many good thinks about this place"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my lunch at La Petite France yesterday.  Since they had positive ratings on Yelp and I was craving for a crape, I gave it a try.  The restaurant has a cozy homey feeling.  I ordered a baked sandwich (ummm I forgot the name. It had tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto) and a glass of house Pinot Grigio. The sandwich came with a salad with fresh greens and the portion was great!  What I enjoyed the most was to have a pretty deep conversation with the owner, Valerie. She is so charming and I could tell instantly that she cares and that she and the chef puts their heart and soul into their offerings.  I strongly recommend this place to anyone craving for some authentic french food. I also recommend to anyone who wants to practice French language. Valerie is from Montreal and the chef is from France!"}
{"text":"This place is totally French and very good in many ways. First, the crepes were perfect. They were light and melt in your mouth. Mine was smoked salmon,  cream cheese, capers, lemon and onion. Absolutely delicious. We also ordered an omelette which was perfect.  We ordered croissants on the side, and they were light and buttery without being greasy or heavy.  Service was excellent.  Coffee was very good. Staff was very friendly.  Excellent value!  You will spend more than at a IHop or Denny's,  but so much better than those places. So worth it!"}
{"text":"Great selection of authentic french pastries.  Elegant country decor and warm hospitality of the staff.  Look for this casual bistro tucked away in this upscale shopping center with Starbucks front and center.   --  I'm from LA and I'll be back...."}
{"text":"What a treat this place is!  The husband/wife team have created a little gem in the desert. From the warm goat cheese salad,($9) to my crepe élysées ($10) and my husband's raves about the beef bourgignone (the most expensive thing on the menu at $22) we left happy!  Oh, and took home a lemon tart since we didn't have room for more - also so lemony and fresh.  You can taste everything is fresh and made right there. We can't wait to return and try the lunch offerings. They've only been open a short time, so we really wish them well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited La Petite France during AZ Restaurant Week. #eatARW #eatAZ
Their three course prix fixe menu selections were perfect -- nothing was unapproachable. My wife had the pear salad, the lamb ribs, and the chocolate creme brulee. I had the shrimp casserole, chicken marsala, and the tarte tatin.

We both enjoyed the meal very much and shared dishes so that we could try as much as we could. I think we both agree that the potatoes that came with her lamb were overdone. She also thought the spice rub on the lamb was a bit heavy-handed, but I thought it brought a brightness to the lamb.

I think if we had any real complaint it might be that the servings seemed small. Perhaps in order to fit three courses into $33/person. We would order them again, though, and I think we'd also go back to try their crepes.

Our young waiter was a lot of fun and took very good care of us as well."}
{"text":"Update 8/29/2015:
I called the restaurant today because I'm befuddled by it all.  We've never had a bad experience with any of the Valley restaurants in the 2 years that we've been doing this and I owe some explanation to the people who plan around the 3rd Wednesday of every month to join Monica and me for ISCUYE. 

Apparently, there are some illnesses in the business-family that are consuming their attention.  A small business like this relies on everyone in the business to operate at its best.  No doubt! I get this.  My family owns a small business.  When one person is out, everyone feels the heat.  Our August reservation was forgotten in a vulnerable moment for the restaurant.   I understand.  

My review, which is not caustic by the way, will stand.  I have no hard feelings!  This review is an accurate account of the events that transpired.  BUT, at least we know WHY it happened.  We might consider this restaurant again next year.  I really wanted that bouillabaisse!  :-)  In my review below, I said \"I'd never go here again\", but ... I'd give a try some time next year if Monica agrees to try it out.  8/29/2015
_________________________________________________________
We scheduled the July and August 2015 International Supper Club UYE at this location.  Why on earth would we have the ISCUYE  in the same place 2 months in a row?   Welp,  definitely not because we liked the food that much.   We never actually had ANY of the food.  I'm so disappointed with the lack of professionalism by this restaurant.   

The first try here we made a reservation on the 3rd Wednesday at 630 pm.   Hours prior to dinner time, they called Monica O to cancel because of an emergency.   OK,  fine.   Things happen. . 

So,  we decided to reschedule for August.   Someone pointed out that the restaurant might be closed on Wednesdays for dinner.   So,  I called and left a message  inquiring about our dinner plans.   I asked if LPF would be open and gave a date,  day and time (Wed Aug 19 at 630pm).   I stated that if they were open,  please reserve a table for a 10 for Aug 19 at 630pm.  A couple days later,  I received a confirmation call/voice-mail confirming the details of the ISCUYE.   

We arrive,  on time and the place was closed.   As soon as I can borrow someone's phone to record a video with the audio from the voice-mail confirming our reservation,  I will.   

I waited a week to write this review because I called 3 times and left 2 voice-mails asking for a call back from someone to help me understand why they would tell me we had a confirmed reservation when they were closed   Maybe there was a good explanation.   Maybe the manager forgot they were closed on Wed.   I am not sure.  I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt.   But,  alas, it has been 8 days,  no call back.   Sadly,  I'd never go here again!   Extremely unprofessional.  

But what irritates me most of all is 2 months in a row we had to scramble our plans at the very last minute because of this place.  Monica and I take a lot of pride in choosing local businesses to patronize every month.   Our fellow Yelpers rely on us to choose good AND reliable AND professional businesses.   This wasn't one.

{"text":"I haven't been all Gung-Ho on writing reviews recently but something just has to be said about La Petite France.  This nestled away little French spot off of Indian Bend and Scottsdale road (Northeast corner) is a spot you must stop in at.  
I went today for Brunch and had a most enjoyable experience.  The Modest Brother-Sister (Server-Chef) combo was such a change-up from your usual cocky male chef situation happening all over town.  The food quality, taste, originality, and presentation was well above the price point....and the vibe you get from the staff is unique.  
***Chef Joanne even gave up some pastries for the road as a bonus. 

I will definitely be going back here."}
