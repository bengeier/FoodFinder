{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ Food Trucks in the Valley, and we dont even eat meat!! They're menu is big enough for my whole family to choose from, including vegetarian option like Jackfruit! WHAt!? What other Foodtruck sells BBQ Jackfruit? They'll make special items and adjustments for if you need, they always do for my little one.   We've eaten from their establishment several times and are yet to be disappointed. Jackfruit Tacos, egg tacos, chiluquilies, jackfruit sandwiches, Cole slaw, breakfast bowl, weve had so much and always the same homemade, made with love quality.   I leave such a great review because until Porkazm we really didnt have a BBQ choice since were vegetarian and haven't needed to look elsewhere since.   Thanks guys. See yall soon!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Just wow!! Best bbq I have had. I'm only upset I drove by it so many times before I stopped and tried it. This will be a weekly stop now. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating here. Family was very rude.$12 and Served us COLD FOOD and they didn't even care. when I expressed my confusion to the family they ignored me.  First lesson of business, make sure every guest is Happy. Will not invest in these people again.  Very upset customer, not okay. Will tell everyone."}
