Apparently this is too short to count as a review so I will tell you a story about cats.  Cats are almost as good as coffeee.  The sterling social does not have cats.  They do have good cofffeeee.  But no cats."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a hot Saturday afternoon needing something cold and something to eat. Just missed brunch. Ended up with an iced latte and a brownie. Both delicious. Nice chill vibe and a wonderful playlist. Must come back for the sammys."}
{"text":"This place has great coffee, and I love their baked treats (tried a coconut and berry loaf) too. They also have a brunch menu available until 3 PM and an all day menu available until 8 PM.  Ordered from their brunch menu the Swiss Sammy with eggs, tomatoes and bacon, on a brioche bun, toasted to perfection, served with fresh arugula greens with a home made dressing, and we asked for an extra side of chorizo. They offered there home made hot sauce, and have this amazing hot sauce made with mango peppers. The whole thing was Delicious. I'm happy we stopped in, we definitely will be coming back, the place is so close to home! 4 stars! 
Next time I'll try their smoothies."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly staff. I'll be back to try the smoothies and brunch soon."}
