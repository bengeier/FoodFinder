{"text":"The environment is gorgeous. Great outdoor space. Very pretty and peaceful. If only the food came anywhere near the aesthetics. The portions are small and presumably pre-made. The sweet potato side is bland, little to no seasoning or flavor. The salad was 100% wilted. The cashew butternut soup was predominately potato and salt. The half pizza off the kids menu was basically a cracker, with a smudge of sauce and even less cheese.  The atmosphere was comparable to sumo maya. Top notch. The ordering experience was comparable to Panera, with less customer service. The food was comparable to a \"healthy\" cafe in a small town with little to no competition.   Sad. The space is awesome and could have been a great place."}
{"text":"I got the steak with mac n cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was decent but not much flavor and very fatty. The garlic mashed potatoes had no flavor at all. Overall it was really bland."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, love the food and the concept. However, after looking at the ingredient lists for most of the meals on their App, I see that CANOLA oil is in almost everything  on the menu. Organic Canola oil means nothing because there's no such thing as a 'canola'.This oil comes from rape seeds which are highly TOXIC and the oil is chemically separated with hexane. It is then deodorized and bleached. Even if Modern Market is buying the expellar pressed Canola, which I doubt, it is still bleached and deodorized so it will not smell and be palatable. Yuck! That's why I cook at home and why I was initially excited about MM, thinkingbIvwouldbget olive oil salad dressings.  I'm disappointed that a restaurant claiming to be  'friends' with 'good fats' would use this in most if not all of their salad dressings and in just about all of their food when the entire food industry uses it and it's harming our health. For what their charging ( plan on $ 30 for lunch for two) I want a healthier oil. Please make salad dressings out of natural, healthful and nutritious oils such as organic olive, light olive, avocado, almond etc. Light olive can be used for frying and makes great salad dressings! Bottom line:  meals can get a little pricey, but the food is outstanding and worth it. I would give 5 stars were it not for the use of  cheap, unimaginative and unhealthy Canola oil."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go from here; service was quick and food was hot. The food its self though no flavor at all. Ordered a margarita pizza and it had 4 sprigs of basil, barely any cheese and the crust was soggy and thin. Also ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich, they managed to make an extremely spicy sandwich with no taste. Wouldn't recommend or eat here again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that trying to find restaurants (other than getting something at Whole Foods) that could accommodate my husband's dietary restrictions. Food was delicious, accommodated my husband's food restrictions, and their root beer was the BOMB. We may only be visiting Scottsdale but we are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I want to write an update to my first review :)  First, I was so impressed with how quickly the team reached out and followed up with me, it really shows great service.  I have been back several times since and the quality has significantly improved! Great food! The fiesta salad and butternut cashew soup are my favorites. I haven't tried another pizza yet, but I will soon!"}
{"text":"First time at Modern Market from word of mouth and I can say it was worth the trip! Had half sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup. Everything was delicious and fresh. Would I go back again  absolutely!!"}
{"text":"So happy Modern Market opened in Old Town Scottsdale! This review is based on three visits so far.  First, the atmosphere is open with lots of natural light, floor-to-ceiling glass windows, a mixture of communal and private tables, and both back and side patios. One wall of their indoor space completely opens for a patio feel as well. Great music selection playing and staff friendly.  I love that they list the calories, fat, carbs, protein and fiber under every dish on menu. They also break it down on the bill and give you your nutritional count (based on daily recommended percentages).   There is an excellent variety of options on the menu and I love that you can combine things and order half a pizza for a mere $5.00 - $6.00. I had breakfast and spoke with a few other diners around me and we were all fans of what we ordered. We agreed that the quality of their bread was excellent and their breakfast potatoes had the best seasoning and fresh herbs in them! I personally had the eggs and sausage ($7.85) which included the potatoes and toast.   We have now tried their version of pepperoni pizza and the crust is light, three different cheese styles and a good amount of sauce. Ordered a full one at dinner and it was piping hot when buzzer went off. Ordered a 1/2 pizza at lunch, and it was closer to cold than hot when buzzer went off so hoping new staff just working out the consistency kinks in their first week. The lunch roman salad included a generous portion with both chicken and a marinated-style tomato on top. I like that you can choose dressings served on the side, light or medium - While the roman salad dressing was tasty, I ordered the medium amount and there was almost no dressing at all so probably will ask for on the side next time. My husband ordered the steak plate (comes with two sides and he chose a double of the arugula salad). Steak cooked very nicely but salad fairly unremarkable, especially the dressing which seemed to be not mixed so was all oil (he ordered it on the side so I tried it).  So breakfast a big hit, lunch and dinner review I'll update once the restaurant has a chance to groove.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Below average food, fine prices. Service nothing to talk about, interesting concept but couldn't shake the feeling that something just feels a bit off about this place."}
{"text":"Just came back from participating in the Eventbrite free entree event at Modern Market and we are fans!  The Ahwatukee area is not lacking in great food options at all but this a fresh and welcome addition to the busy Ray corridor.  I loved the very obvious row of arrows upon walking in that direct you right to the counter and menu.  It was pretty busy for a Thursday night, so I was a little nervous about finding a seating option that would accommodate our son's car seat but table opened up right after we ordered.  There is a lot of seating options, which is nice.  The dining room is divided by an open-weave partition - the side closest to the kitchen area and counter were high tops. On the other side there are a few high tops but mostly booths and low seating areas, which is what we were looking for.  Out side there are about 5 or 6 tables for those willing to brave the Arizona heat (they will be perfect come fall and winter).   You serve yourself for the most part - they have people clearing tables, taking used plates, and tidying up throughout the restaurant.  The customer walks up to the counter, chooses and purchases their food, then gets a buzzer for food pick up before picking their seat.  I didn't get a great look at the full set up, but there's a partially open kitchen to the left of the register counter that you follow down the dining room to the pick up window.  There were napkins immediately to the right of the window when you go to get your food but utensils will be given to you when you pick up your food and you have to ask for additional utensils if needed.  Kitty corner to the pick up area is the counter for straws, lids (if you get a drink up), condiments, fountain drinks machine, and coffee/tea.  I thought the fountain drinks were pretty interesting - no brands, just the type of drink.    My husband had the grilled steak plate with sides of asparagus and garlic potatoes while I had the grilled chicken plate with the sweet potatoes and Mac and cheese.  Sadly they were out of the roasted veggies, my first choice for a side, but I'll try them the next time we're in.  Since our meals were free, we also purchased a pint of Four Peaks Kiltlifter for him and a glass of kombucha for myself.  Waiting for the food took about 10 mins which passed by quickly as we got situated at our table.    We both liked our food quite a bit.  I loved the flavor of my rosemary sweet potatoes but I detected a little big of spice, possibly a little ginger (couldn't focus because I was eating quickly since my son was about to lose it).  My chicken, while a little bland and under-seasoned on its own, was pretty tasty when paired with the salsa verde.  The salsa verde reminded me more of chimichurri sauce (which I love) and I wish I had had more of it to spread over my chicken.  My Mac and cheese was good - similar to the gooey Panera/Paradise Bakery while Mac and cheese but with some gooey-ier cheese on top.  I had to fight my husband off from trying to polish off too much.    My husband's steak was cooked to a nice medium well (my preferred level, I understand you are judging) and also paired with the salsa verde.  His asparagus was cooked and seasoned well; a little more on the tender side than I prefer but he liked that it was a little softer.  The garlic mashed potatoes were the clear winner out of all the sides - it's difficult to get it wrong but oh so wonderful when it is done well.  They used red potatoes and it wasn't a creamy mash, more of a chunky mash which I prefer.  Lots of garlic flavor, pepper, and just the right amount of salt. In fact, everything that was meant to be seasoned was well seasoned and not too salty or under seasoned (except for the chicken but I feel like the focus is meant for the salsa verde). My husband, while satisfied, did feel for the price it was a little less food than he would have preferred.  I felt good having just the amount I did so while the price is a little steeper than I would want for a weekly dinner option, I do understand we are paying for the farm-to-table experience.   Husband's Four Peaks Kiltlifter was fresh - no complaints.  I had never had kombucha before so the young man at the counter let me try some before I moved forward with purchasing it.  It was pretty tangy but no tangier than a good lemonade.  I can't remember what flavor they had on tap but it was reddish pink and something I would get again.    Overall, we had a great experience and plan to go again now that it is finally open and we had a chance to sample at least two entrees and four sides.  I noticed they also had breakfast/brunch options so we may try them for brunch before the craziness of Snooze opening next door takes over and we are whisked away into the premier brunch place.   For those who are interested, I felt like the atmosphere definitely lent itself to families with children and couples/groups/singles who didn't have kids. Love that they have an open and inviting atmosphere. Recommended!"}
{"text":"PLEASE READ. this is gonna be a long story, but i promise you it's worth the read before you even think about going to this place. my mom and I have been going to this location since the day it opened and we genuinely liked it. my mom always orders the \"arugula mozz\" sandwich and she's vegetarian so that's really the only option for sandwiches for her. the few times that she has ordered that sandwich, the mozzarella cheese is cold as ice, to the point where you can't even eat it, and this sandwich comes HOT. today, June 21, 2017, my mom and i went there at around 5:00 pm. again, my mom ordered this sandwich today, she hasn't gotten this sandwich the last two times we went there because she didn't want to bother taking it back. the lady that helped us the last time we were there told us that she would make it herself because she knows it always comes out cold, OH and don't mind the fact that she's the same lady that makes the food with the SAME gloves she uses to handle the register. so here's what the real issue is and i promise you after you read this you will think twice before giving this place your money. after we got our food, we sat down and immediately my mom felt her mozzarella cheese, and yet again it was ice cold. she approached the so called \"manager\" named KYLE CLEMENT and explained to him nicely that the sandwich was cold. here was his response word for word. \"well ma'am you complain about this sandwich every time you come here so why don't you order something else.\" i kid you not and I'm not exaggerating this is the exact response he told my mom while i was sitting right there. my mom got very angry and responded by saying \"i don't appreciate you talking to me like that and and this is the only vegetarian sandwich you carry so what else am i supposed to eat\" he then felt like shit and asked if he could give her a refund for her meal and she said \"that's not the issue here it's how you just responded to me and I will be contacting the owner.\" and just to put it out there, my father has been in the food and beverage industry for over 23 years so we know business and all i have to say is this restaurant has no idea how to run a business and that manager needs to be fired because he is in the wrong business. we will NEVER step foot in this place again, so disturbing and unprofessional!!!!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars, as the food is delicious...the service on the other hand is less than stellar. I have ordered from this location twice now and both times left slightly disappointed.  My first time dining-in at the restaurant was great.. aside from the fact that my wintergreen salad had multiple ingredients missing, and my soup did not come with the bread that I was told came with it.  The second time around, I decided to order online delivery of my food. I loved the soup/salad combo that I had previously ordered- so I decided to place the same order. I noticed on DoorDash (their delivery service of choice) the soup that I wanted was not showing up as an option. I decided to call the restaurant to ask someone whether or not the soup was available. I was greeted in a hurried, terribly rude manner. Whoever took the call seemed irritated that I was even asking what their soup of the day was stating that the restaurant \"always carries the same soups. EVERY DAY.\" I explained that I was not able to find the soup that I had been inquiring about on their delivery site and I was told that the employee \"did not work for door dash\" and therefore \"could NOT help me with my order.\" I decided that I would order the Mac &a Cheese as my side instead of the soup. My delivery came in a timely manner- which I was very pleased with! Unfortunately, the potatoes in my salad were hard/overcooked, and my macaroni and cheese was half empty!!  I am so upset that I have had two not-so-great experiences here...I do very much enjoy the food but the lack of customer service is a pretty big turn-off."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars for me.   My boyfriend heard of this place through his gym and picked us up lunch. We both got the same order of steak with Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. Mac and cheese was decent but not very flavorful. The garlic mashed potatoes and steak were both ridiculously bland, not even a hint of garlic in the garlic mash. For the price of the entree I would have to say that it is not worth it."}
{"text":"I come here pretty frequently, especially when I'm in the mood for something on the healthier side. I love their salads and their pizzas are pretty good. It always seems clean and the interior is modern and stylish. They have a mobile app, which can be used to order in advance, and I've gotten them delivered through Grubhub- very convenient!"}
{"text":"Really good and unique dishes! I gave it 4 starts because there are dishes I love and some I don't care for much. But I love how fresh and Organic everything is! Everyone is very nice there too!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. So glad they're opening another one in the Promenade. Everything is so fresh and tasty. Can't recommend highly enough. Could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"This is EXACTLY what Ahwatukee has been needing! We enjoyed breakfast and look forward to coming back for lunch and dinner. The food was fresh and they even served our waffle with REAL maple syrup! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite part about Modern Market is the food tastes very fresh. There is a wide selection of dishes, flavors, and proteins to choose from which makes it easy to please a group of people. I ordered the half steak salad and half BLT avocado sandwich while my wife ordered the half Wintergreen salad and half potato leak pizza. Portions we're generous and filling"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!!! I came here 2 days in a row and it is super healthy, the flavors are amazing, prices are super reasonable!! I will definitely continue to come here and the staff is so genuine and tries to help you get the best price and asked how everything was and if we needed anything!! Favorite new place"}
{"text":"We come here atleast twice/month. We love the casual atmosphere and the healthy food. The people who work here are always friendly and the place is super clean from the top down. I would highly recommend this place for couples and families alike."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork bowl and the flavors were just perfect. healthy and fresh. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So glad this place came to Ahwatukee! I had the Thai coconut salad and Pulled pork Bahn mi sandwich and both were amazing. Perfect balance of flavors in each and good portions. Plus they have Cartel coffee and Four Peaks beer on tap as well as kombucha on tap! Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Love this new place! I get my hair done right next door at Sachi, and was so pleased to hear my stylist recommend Modern Market. Both my son and I had the steak plate. Steak was cooked perfectly, sides were flavorful, and they have kombucha on tap!"}
{"text":"WOW! This is by far one of the best places to eat near Chandler! I love the healthy options. Fresh, organic and locally sourced foods. The pizza is fantastic. We were able to try their summer pizza with squash, goat cheese and walnuts! Delish! Tasted the sweet potato mash, and very cheesy mac. Best was the pork bowl, lots of veggies and flavor! Next want to try breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family to give this place a try. Did not disappoint! Wide variety of food, fantastic ingredients, excellent food! Decor is awesome and service was great."}
{"text":"A fast food service model with restaurant quality food.  I had the chipotle steak sandwich which was really good.  My wife had the BLT and was disappointed as the bacon was not as crispy as she likes and the sandwich was a little greasy.  The service is fast - and it was really crowded at the time.  We will definitely try it again as the food we saw other patrons eating all looked good."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here recently for breakfast, to try a shiny new place out.  We were essentially the only ones there at opening, and the place was really bright and welcoming.  The prices here are SO affordable. The food we had was very flavorful, fresh and straight up delicious. I think they are able to manage this by making reasonable portions and offering some sides a la carte!  Despite that, I still took home of my breakfast sandwich and had it for lunch.  I hadn't realized this place was a chain, but it is clearly a chain done right!  Besides the cashier mentioned below, the staff were all jazzed to be working there and on several occasions came to check on us outside to make sure we were enjoying our food. Speaking of, the outside patio was perfect and I could see this as being a great place to have a group brunch.  The negatives is there was no place to grab napkins. I asked the cashier and he looked puzzled when I asked for additional napkins (we were given 1 per person when we picked up our food from the inside). He then tore off some scratchy paper towels from the handwashing sink.  Weird.  Second negative is I love my fake, terrible-for-you Diet Coke. I asked if they had they had Coke and such and he said yes. Well, for a few bucks, I ended up not drinking soda after all since they have one of those natural soda brands installed instead. To me, they taste gross. To normal people, perhaps they are preferred...but I was annoyed that I spent the money on something I felt I had clarified. Also the drink cost is negligible so I wasn't about to get a refund for two bucks. Oh well, lesson learned.  Money saving tip: your receipt offers 10% off another visit if you come back within 7 days. If you live in the area, I also just received a coupon in the mail as part of one of those Valpak mailers for B1G1 free meals.   Bottom line: I will be back, and based upon how much we both enjoyed our breakfast entrees, I can't wait to try lunch here!  It's a bit too casual for my tastes for dinner, but for lunch/brunch/breakfast, this place is a great addition."}
{"text":"Was really hoping this place was going to be good. Ugh. Food is shipped in and microwaved or put  in a toaster oven. Food quality is awful. Ambiance is zero. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"New place in a great location. But the food is only fair.  Over priced for the portions, quality and flavor. A weak imitation of Flowerchild or Farm and Craft.    Granted they just opened, so I'll give the place a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The food was so fast & so fresh. The coffee was smooth. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"In love again.   Keep on coming back for this amazing food.   Friends tag along.   Super clean and good company make it a blast.  The staff are super friendly and patient."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Simply a must for all health-conscious friends. After perusing the vast menu of healthy eats, step up and order from the counter. Receipts not only represent your purchase, but also detail the nutritional value for those tracking macros. Delicious options which finally feel safe for patrons with food allergies!"}
{"text":"Nice healthy menu with quite a few vegan options! I need to go back and try other things. I had the tofu plate with sweet potatoes and split pea rice. The tofu was good once dipped in the dressing. Sweet potatoes were amazing. The rice was ok, I had higher expectation since the staff recommended it but it was a bit bland. The presentation was rather boring since my order was white and orange. Lol... I'll be back and will make sure to get more veggies. My friend got the Caesar salad with salmon which looked nice and she enjoyed it. Loved that we could sit on the patio and enjoy the weather!"}
{"text":"First time here. Walked in there at lunch time on Sunday. Was pretty empty so i was initially concerned. They carry unbranded colas but the creme flavored cola I tried was pretty good! The seasonal corn chowder soup I wasnt a huge fan of. The curry flavor mixed into it didnt go well together for me. Also had the steak plate with mac and cheese and the garlic potatoes. Tasted pretty good for the price!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Drove by, stuck in traffic, and decided to stop here instead of CFA. Very, very pleasantly surprised! If you're looking for some amazing service, tasty clean eating, fresh ingredients, and sustainable sourced food, this is the spot for you!! The pulled pork is BOMB"}
{"text":"This is such a cute, friendly, welcoming place! Not expensive but not cheap! Totally worth it! I had the Salmon caesar and it was delicious. It definitely has options for everyone: kids and adults! 100% 10/10"}
{"text":"I'd been to Modern Market in Denver before and was so excited to see one opening in Ahwatukee! I've been 5 times and every time has been great. The decor is light and casual - there is also plenty of outside seating but it's been to hot to try that yet.   There's always at least a small line when I'm there, but they get the food out quickly and correctly. I've tried pizza, salad, sandwiches and the meat / tofu and sides platter - I have truly liked everything so far. It's probably the best healthy fast-casual restaurant we have."}
{"text":"I really like the concept here. The benefits of a full blown restaurant (quality, made to order food) with the convenience of order-at-the-counter fast casual.  Walking in, the interior is modern and chic yet feels inviting and warm. Too many places go for that spacious, metallic, sterile feel. I really loved the warm wood beams and white stone countertops.  You order at the counter and get a pager that will notify you when to come up to the pick up area. I went with half a \"M'Rita\" pizza and their seasonal pulled pork bahn mi sandwich. Both were really tasty and I loved the fact that I could order half a pizza or half a sandwich for half the prices - perfect for when you want to try a bit of everything. Bahn Mi could have used more of a sauce to balance out the dryer textures - some mayo, butter or aioli would have made it perfect.  Some unique points are that they have craft fountain soda (yum) and calories/nutritional macros printed on your receipt. I hesitated to look at mine after demolishing half a pizza and full pulled pork sandwich... buuut it's good to have for those who are looking to stay #swole.  Overall, super enjoyed my visit here and will be back. The menu has a lot of other enticing items I'm wanting to try, from dinner plates to brunch type fare."}
{"text":"I've heard this place was delicious so I finally found time to stop and get food on my way to work yesterday.  As good as it looked, unfortunately I couldn't eat it. When I got to work i discovered my salad was made wrong, and I wasn't able to even try it. Pretty disappointing that I wasted $13"}
{"text":"This is a counter style place your order and pickup when your buzzer goes off type of place Indoor and outdoor seating  The food was good but small menus selection Some had s little too much spice for me Healthy food though! Clean busy location on Ray rd  Plenty of parking"}
{"text":"Can you make food healthy and delish? The answer is yes!  I went with a friend to try out this new place that opened up in the Scottsdale Promenade for dinner, and I'm happy I did. I got the curry salmon and kale, and my friend got the Pepe pizza. I really liked my salmon. It was cooked well. The curry was yummy, not spicy - actually,? I just learned that it was a coconut sweet potato curry. I don't even care for sweet potatoes (I know, I'm one of the few), and I really liked it. The heirloom rice was flavorful, and the kale was a nice touch of greens. It's worth the price. The Pepe pizza was good without being overly greasy. The whole wheat crust was thin. It could've used a little more cheese...sooo we added parmesan? cheese but I guess that defeated the whole \"healthier\" purpose huh? Baha. Oh well! Next time, though, I think I will opt for things other than pizza.   The fountain drinks are made with cane sugar. There are two teas - I really liked the unsweetened and noncaffeinated? hibiscus one. There are three flavors of lemonades. We tried the cucumber mint (more cucumber than mint) and the carrot one. Both, in my opinion? were too sweet? and were good once watered down a bit.   The decor is super cute. It's bright, open, and chic. There is outside seating that are separated by a garage-style door/wall. There are self-loving quotes sprinkled on the walls. There's a board that shows you where they got their ingredients from.   This is definitely a nice, healthier lunch spot that I would recommend to friends.   Oh! Lastly, it's kind of hidden and behind all the main shops like Nordstrom Rack and Ulta. Turn on Paradise Ln for best access. :)"}
{"text":"This was the first -and only-time I will eat at the this place. The only good thing I had was the soda. It took so long to get my food, I had to go up front to find my order which was being confused with the previous patron'sorder. I ordered a BLT. The bacon was burned black, the bread was toasted pretty close to black and hard and the sandwich was cold.  How can you mess up a BLT sandwich?  The avocado aioli on the sandwich was ok. The tomato slice, however, was mushy and tasteless  The roasted veggie side was inedible, cold, undercooked - almost uncooked- and tasteless.  He mashed potatoes were cold as well. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. A very disappointing experience. This restaurant gives organic/alternative foods a bad name."}
{"text":"Today was opening day, and I can't believe how seamless this place was run! Amazing customer service, tasty food, excellent prices. I walked out and said aloud, \"I need to write them a Yelp review!\" I'm so pleased with my experience and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"New place in the neighborhood.  It offers breakfast which is welcomed.   We had the bacon and eggs and the spinach bacon scramble.  Both were very good. I had a coffee which was excellent!  Colombian bean. And the price is only a $1.50. We were here on a Saturday morning and were able to order quickly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much in my backyard, so I use it as my kitchen when I'm too lazy to cook.  I tried all the salads, all the soups, and am currently making my way through the pizza menu - everything so far has been delicious.   One thing I love about the soups and pizza is that they are never over salted. Just perfect.  Service is ALWAYS friendly and with a smile. As much as I visit modern market, I've never encountered bad service. The place is kept spotless too. I've brought friends who live further up North Scottsdale to Modern Market and now they are hooked and gladly drive the 25 minutes it takes to get here so they can get their Superfood Salad and Green Chili chicken soup fix. Delicious fresh high quality food, friendly employees (love the woman with the fabulous green hair), fair prices and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place. Been here close to 10 times and never had a bad experience. It's not necessarily an experience that will blow you away. But the food is great. It's definitely an incredible option for breakfast when you don't wanna wait an hour to get into Snooze."}
{"text":"Since I live nearby, I was excited to have a place where I could go get a coffee and a snack. Well, this place is more like a Paradise Bakery/Panera Bread but pricier and no real snack or bakery items.   Admittedly a coffee addict, I walked in at noon on a Sunday and........they had stopped serving coffee........ C'mon, really? A \"modern market\" and I can't get a coffee at noon on even brunch-Sunday!??  I was only in once and you lost me there.   Also note: they stop serving breakfast items at 11. And yes even on Sunday. Try all the places down the street that serve brunch instead."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. The pizza itself is tasty but the dough is sooooo thin, it's almost not even worth eating. You spend money to be hungry at the end.   Yesterday I got soup (broccoli) and mashed potatoes. The soup wasn't good so I only had one bite. The mashed potatoes were very peppery and tasted off but I ate them because I was hungry. Big mistake.  Not long after I started vomiting and was so sick all night long. Couldn't even keep down ice chips. That's all I ate all day so this is the only thing that could have caused my food poisoning. Don't eat the mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite fast food place. The food is ALL organic, even the cookies. They have proteins plus sides or salads or sandwiches!  A little more expensive than your average take out, typically of Organic, but worth every penny knowing it is healthy."}
{"text":"Super cute spot! Love the location. Food is amazing and the service was perfect! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this is NOT a review of the food at Modern Market. Unfortunately my mom and I never even made it past the counter before we were disappointed.   We're currently on the Whole30 and neither of us have really gone out to eat due to the diet's restrictions. When I heard about Modern Market, I was super excited! It was supposedly accommodating to all diets and I though we could treat ourselves for making it most of the way through.   I realized we were going to eat a salad and I was perfectly happy with this. However, after scanning the allergen book there, we found all the dressings to have agave in them. \"Ok,\" I figured - we'd just have some balsamic and EVOO. But when we asked if we could sub oil and vinegar for dressing, the girl at the counter said, \"the dressing is already mixed.\" My mom explained that we understood and couldn't we just have some oil on the side - they had to make the other dressings somehow so they must have it on hand. But she shook her head and repeated that it was all pre-made.   Needless to say we were disappointed with the experience. The restaurant touts itself as being accommodating and friendly to a variety of diets, and this may indeed have been the case. But unfortunately, the girl at the counter didn't seem to be willing or knowledgeable enough to assist us with our requests."}
{"text":"We've eaten at 7 Modern Markets (in CO, TX and AZ) and we love their food. The pizzas have been a favorite, but now the salmon plate and the salmon salad are in the running for my first choice. Everything is so fresh tasting, and it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"First off, this place is a quick service restaurant, nothing to do with a market. The same well functioning genius that came up with the name must have designed the kids eat free on Sundays. So you have to buy two full size entree to get the free kids meal. Single parent? Out with your kids but not your spouse? You better read the fine print and eat like a horse to qualify. This isn't about being cheap, it's about being tricked by the Bernie Madoff bait and switch this place has got. The food is pretty good but with the dumbass name and policies you had better sample it quick before modern becomes history"}
{"text":"All of their pizzas are delicious! Love this place and so glad a healthy and delicious place came to Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"Fresh tasty food, clean and bright restaurant. If you want to eat healthy and leave a little hungry this is your place! Couldn't give it 5 stars as there is a bit of 'I just work here' vibe about the staff. Also given the portion sizes it seems a bit overpriced. But I am so happy to see healthy casual dining restaurants popping up. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Modern Market was very underwhelming. Their food was bland and nothing to write home about, and the service was mediocre at best.  A friend and I got there at about 10:55am on a Saturday expecting to get breakfast/brunch. We got in line to order, and their overhead menu was still reading all of their breakfast options. By the time we got to the front of the line (there was basically no one in the restaurant, only 2 ppl in front of us) the menu had changed from breakfast to lunch. Literally at 11:00am on the dot. I asked the person taking our order if they could still serve breakfast, and she said no! Both my friend and I were like \"Seriously?! We were in line when your menu changed! You can't make an exception?\" to which she replied that the kitchen wouldn't do it under any circumstances. At that moment, the head cook (I think) came out from the back, and incredibly begrudgingly said that he would make an exception for us. Wow, thank you. That's so considerate...  I ordered a waffle and my friend ordered a scramble. It did come out pretty quickly, which was nice, but my waffle was seriously bad. It was soggy and incredibly bland. I also asked for extra syrup, but the same guy who had begrudgingly \"allowed\" us to order breakfast one minute late, again begrudgingly told me that they had just put it away but that he \"guessed\" he could get me more - with the caveat that they would not warm it up. It was ice cold.  Overall, I feel like if you're going to be a restaurant like this, it's really not in your best interest to completely stop serving breakfast food on a Saturday at 11:00am on the dot, with no exceptions. People love brunch. Brunch restaurants make a lot of money. Brunch is breakfast+lunch. Just do both! And for god's sake, what kind of a restaurant stops serving breakfast as early as 11am on a Saturday anyway?! You're in Old Town, so most of your patrons are going to be hung over wrecks from the night before and most likely don't wake up until at least noon. Even McDonald's learned that that was a mistake."}
{"text":"Food and service is great. I'm surprised at how not busy it is. You have the option to eat inside or out, both very cute and accommodating to any party size. I paid $12 for everything shown in the pic!"}
{"text":"I love the concept for this place, and the atmosphere is just as trendy as the menu. I got the BBQ pork sandwich with a side greens&asiago salad and a drink for $14.55. My food wasn't anything special, and the calorie count on my sandwich is 710, which doesn't sound much better than any competitor restaurant. I think the difference is in the ingredients, so I feel like I made a healthy choice eating here. I'm a little disappointed that this restaurant only offers one-use plastic cups and straws, that wastefulness doesn't seem to fit the concept. That being said, everything tasted good and I'll probably be back to try more of the unique menu items."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp, we decided to try.  Highly Highly Recommended, if you are looking for a healthy alternative."}
{"text":"This place needs a person with a sign up front ASAP. Too delicious to be this slow, be a bummer for this place to not keep going! Had pesto chicken sandwich, kale mushroom pizza, and a chipotle steak sandwich as well. Everything was fresh, and delicious to top it off the set up and vibes are lovely as well!"}
{"text":"Came into today for lunch and I'm so glad my manager introduced me to this place.   I don't usually go on a scavenger hunt for a top notch healthy place but when someone recommends it, I definitely go out and try it!  Modern Market has just about the right prices for Whole and Half meals (Salads, Sandwiches and pizza) unlike other crazy natural, healthy food places.  Cashier was very helpful and friendly to understand the menu and items, food was quickly prepared and most certainly fresh!  The carrot lemonade was something special (super delicious).   I wish they had smoothies available! That would just put the cherry on top of things."}
{"text":"So far so good! I was able to attend their soft opening and will definitely go back to try more. The service was excellent. The prices were reasonable for the quality (and $2 wine!), atmosphere casual but menu is unique!"}
{"text":"Had the steak sandwich - very tasty. The ginger-maple roasted fresh veggies were delicious. Friendly and efficient service. They serve breakfast too! We can't wait to go back when it's not 110 degrees and dine on the patio!"}
{"text":"New eatery in Ahwatukee! While the food is fresh and delish, the wait was painful. There many diners using free entree tickets so that may have contributed to the wait time.....but it is not a full house either. Still many tables available. The waffle iron was down and my eggs were served over medium instead of scrambled. Not a deal breaker for me though. I'll give it another chance for lunch in another day."}
{"text":"So disapppinted!! The food looks good and theoretically sounds fresh and healthy but my breakfast is actually pretty sucky. Kale & sausage scramble (subbed out sausage for chicken at the guys suggestion). My potatoes are cold and not crispy. My gluten free toast (pretty decent gluten free) is also cold. HOW IS IT COLD WHEN THERE IS A BUZZER AND I COLLECTED IT!!?? THe chicken in my scramble is nasty- dry and tastes pre-cooked and cut from a factory. The kale in the scramble would be better if it was more cooked. Basically, I can't tell the fresh part. The flavour in the scramble is good and the staff are very helpful. The quality and atmosphere simply aren't here. Sad.  I originally posted 3 stars but as I continue to eat and contemplate if I want to even eat this or just go somewhere else (and throw away my $11 plate) I think 2 stars is as high as I can go. I would expect a 24hr diner in Phoenix to be this good even though they wouldn't have gluten free. My breakfast is really really not good. Waste of $."}
{"text":"\"Farm Fresh Eateries\"?   Are you kidding?!  I live close by to this place and was hoping I would have a good alternative for good food.   Have tried it twice now and both times it just bombed out for me.   The last trip I ordered the \"Homestyle Plate\" of Ranch Steak and two sides.   I wanted more nutritious sides, so I ordered the roasted vegetables and the summer squash (online menu had yummy looking asparagus, but not available at this location).   The steak was salty, overcooked and tough.  The roasted vegetables were potatoes and a couple small pieces of carrot that were old, rubbery and too salty.   the summer squash was yellow and green zucchini, undercooked and crunchy and swimming in oil and salt.  Yuck.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We went for lunch a couple weeks ago and the service was fantastic and the food was amazing. I definitely will be back in soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place it is so clean healthy and neat!! So many veggie and protein options while keeping it simple at the same time. This place is definitely one of my favorite places to eat and i will be going regularly to try different things on the menu. So glad i found it !"}
{"text":"The app wasn't working and received a message stating I would need to call the store.  I called the store number (480 462-2102) which apparently goes to a \"central location\" which sent my order somewhere else. I did noWhen I arrived at the store they were not able to access my order and had no record of me calling. I was informed that the only way I could order directly with the store for takeout was through the website, NOT the app as that also is through a third party or even by calling the LOCAL number... The staff at the store were helpful, and the food was good.  I would say not being able to call the store directly is a huge misstep IMO. Once this place gets the kinks worked out it could be good."}
{"text":"Not bad. I have never been into the pure healthy eating places. Wet I got tasted good but really didn't fill me up. Came here cause my sister wanted to, not opposed to going back but not someplace I'd norm."}
{"text":"The food is average we have been there twice and kept expecting things to be better than the last time we were there  But the potatoes on my salad were dry and greasy I don't even enjoy potatoes but they came on the salad and it was the salad I wanted since I didn't care for the others so I ordered And I expected it to be fresh  I know my husband didn't enjoy the asparagus on his plate he said they had no flavor and his chicken was just okay The spices took away from the chicken and sweet potatoes were average it was our second visit - we thought we would give it one more try we can't remember what we had the first time we were not that impressed it's in our neighborhood but we will not be going back"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review of this place. There were a few issues when they first opened but all that has been ironed out. I've been coming here consistently for the past 8 months and they've delivered great food and service every time. Food is great quick healthy low cost food. Service is amazing. The manager always greats me when I'm here. Decor is awesome, 2 great patios. Location is right in old town. I can't think of anything I don't love about this place."}
{"text":"Solid salads, poor pizza served fast casual. Bonus points for coconut water. And a good selection of sandwiches and salads. You can eat healthy here."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of healthy restaurants that will cater to vegetarian, Paleo, and many other lifestyles so I always get excited when I find a place that does!  The ambiance is great! Open, bright and you are greeted by friendly staff members. The service was fantastic. I'm a huge pain in the butt when it comes to ordering due to my \"lifestyle\" and they didn't seem to have an qualms about it. They even looked up the ingredients to the Caesar salad dressing for me to determine if I can eat it or not. Super awesome and much appreciated! Thank you!  The food was good. I ordered the Roman salad which came with grilled chicken, kale, romaine, cucumbers and tomatoes. It comes with other stuff, but I omitted those items. The vegetables were fresh, looking and tasting delicious. The Chicken was overall decent, but could have been seasoned more and was slightly over cooked. Another positive aspect is this exotic hibiscus tea they have! Oh my, so yummy! It's not sweetened and is just a little tart. I would love one right now.   Overall, definitely recommend this place! Super jealous I don't have one by my house or office."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for healthy food, fast!   I ended up going with the chicken with the sweet potatoes and roasted vegetables on the side.   All were good and the pesto, olive oil-type sauce for the chicken was really good!   The only downside is how small the portions were. I don't know if it's because I got a to-go order, but it was an unusually small amount."}
{"text":"We also took advantage of the event brite 2 free meals promotion. I agree with other reviewers about the great atmosphere and customer service. I absolutely love the amount of healthy and fresh choices on the menu! Beer and wine on tap too. So why only 3 stars? Food was kind of bland and just no wow factor for me. Husband had the kale pizza. It smelled and looked amazing, but taste wise it was just not bad, not great, just good. Same for the Toscano salad that I had. I did enjoy the Curry Yellow Split Pea soup, which I'd say was the highlight of the meal. We both want to come back to try some of the other menu items. I do recommend checking it out for yourself!  Another small con: only 2 bathrooms=lines."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and cool! The guy that helped us order was so nice and even gave us free drinks so we could try out their amazing lemonades my favorite was the mint cucumber. I got the salmon Caesar salad today the salmon was cooked perfectly and the salad was dressed in a very tasty Caesar dressing. Definitely coming back and telling everyone about this place!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. For being a holiday weekend it was dead. I had a mimosa and a scramble. The mimosa was 90% orange juice and very small. It was hardly worth the $4, as it was just a very small glass of OJ. The potatoes as my side dish were cold and old. My daughter enjoyed her waffle. My husband said his bacon and eggs were average. The ambiance is nice with a cute patio and an open wall room out front. The counter staff was polite.  We will not come back here. It was a waste of money and family brunch. With so many great brunch places nearby I can't imagine anyone coming here- unless, perhaps, you're getting your car serviced across the street or you work nearby ."}
{"text":"Great food, great value.  We had a pizza and a couple of $3 glasses of wine and were really happy with our meal.  Love the attention given to clean & healthy ingredients, but I really wish you didn't have to order at a counter and then find a table.  I'd love this place even more if it were a sit down restaurant with a wait staff."}
{"text":"I tried Modern Market for the first time yesterday and will be going back, bringing everyone I know. There were plenty of vegetarian options and the helpful staff readily customized vegan. I had 1/2 Superfood salad and a cup of Curry Split Pea soup. The ingredients were very fresh, the portions generous, the price moderate, and everything was exceptionally tasty. Great first experience."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night for the 2nd and last time. Very disappointed in the food and twice they forgot our drink choice.   - salmon plate w chimichurri - the salmon was beyond well done, the serving size is about 3oz of salmon and SO SALTY.  I love chimichurri but that was also SO SALTY - together it was inedible.   - pepperoni pizza was below average meh tasting pizza.    - Forgot the drink we ordered and paid for (twice)   -  Husband's food was ok, but twice did they send the wrong chips w his order.   Many other good places in the area to choose from."}
{"text":"Place was delicious! A lot of food considerations were made for healthier options. Would return to try everything on the menu- just not at lunch time. NO PARKING anywhere at lunch time less time that a 1/4 mile walk away."}
{"text":"We were able to get two free meals thought their promotion on Eventbrite. This was such a great deal to come out and try their food. I must say that I was very impressed with the food, atmosphere and the staff. They have many different items on the menu and you have the ability always do half of your meal with a salad. Such a great verity of food. Ordering was super easy and you have one of the notification pucks to tell you when your food is ready to be picked up.  There is plenty of parking in the shopping center so that is one less thing to worry about.  The staff is super nice and attentive to the customers around them.  I recommend this place for people to try out. You will not be disappointed in the service or the food."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite places to go to in the valley. I love the atmosphere and the menu of this place. It's aesthetically pleasing, especially for a photographer like myself. I order the same exact thing for the countless times I've been here though I'll admit it's a little pricey, it's worth it. I highly recommend getting the steak plate with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. I was sad when they removed having roasted asparagus as a side but its all good. This place is definitely worth a stop and all the friends I have taken here for the first time loved it."}
{"text":"I've been to Modern Market three times. I have had the chicken, green chilli soup, and margarita pizza. Each time I came away a little disappointed. The portions are a little tiny and it's a little overpriced in my opinion. The atmosphere is really cool. There is indoor and outdoor seating. They serve wine, beer, and have a cool/unique soda brand. The black cherry soda is really good."}
{"text":"What a great concept and tasty, healthy options! My coworkers and I all tried different dishes and no one was disappointed. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great service. Food was delicious with every bite but not quite filling."}
{"text":"I had the Thai coconut chicken salad with the dressing on the side   Ordered the half ended up with the full   No complaints as I think you need to full size for a meal. It was seriously yummy.   The salad is a very moist  so I would strongly recommend that the dressing is on the side.    The BLT  was fresh with a good combination of flavours.  The slaw on the side needed something, really added nothing to the plate"}
{"text":"Love Modern Market, they opened in Colorado while I was still living there. The food is good, I consider it a farm to table fast food concept. Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner is good. You can do half a pizza or full and they tell you the calories and nutrition information on the menu and on your receipt. This location is a good size, two outside patios and honestly not very busy. I have always be happy with their food, today my husband and I ate breakfast here. He had the green chili and eggs and I had the pear waffle with a side of bacon. My favorite salad is their superfood salad, I only wish I lived closer. Definitely plan on making this a staple when over here in Scottsdale teaching yoga."}
{"text":"Nice facility. Enjoyed the outdoor patio and good menu with lots of selections. Excellent t chicken sandwich in a fresh roll/ciabatta with good pieces of chicken. Coleslaw was bit off as well as the MAC 'n Cheese (a bit grannie). I'd come back!"}
{"text":"I attended their soft grand opening today for lunch. Excellent fresh food, friendly and efficient servers.  Will make this a \"to go to\" place for breakfast and lunch for quick service and delicious food. Going to try breakfast at their official opening next Monday."}
{"text":"Tried it twice, first time kale & quinoa salad with chicken and today Thai coconut salmon salad with side of veggies. Both chicken and salmon were dry. I had more carrots and onions then greens in my Thai salad. Veggies are not worth it ... again loaded onions, literally 4 small pieces of broccoli and three small slices of I think potatoes. Disappointed, I had high expectations for this spot... but their cucumber mint drink is refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"The employees are nice but it's an icebox inside, they literally give you 2 cups of lettuce for $10, and all bread in their sandwiches for $10, in addition, paid no attention to the food allergy I informed of, had to send the food back to get remade... good thing I noticed before I swallowed it!!"}
{"text":"This place was no disappointment! The restaurant next-door had a line out the door. And lots of people waiting on the patio so we chose modern market instead and it was a good decision. No waiting and the food was just what I love to eat. Good clean eating. The quality of food served here is excellent.  Vegetarian options available"}
{"text":"If you want something healthy this is the place to be. You order and they give you a buzzer & when it's done cooking you go pick it up.   The drinks are a bit different.   I got the sliced chicken & garlic mash potatoes with roasted veggies. My chicken was cold & the potatoes were spicy for me. They have brick oven pizza which is good.  The decor is interesting. With plants.   They have seating outside."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Clean, efficient, healthy!  I was really tired of the salad joints springing up whose salad dressing didn't taste very good.  Those places refused to release the ingredient list also.  Modern Market's salad dressing was very good--no crazy filler ingredients and tasted fresh!"}
{"text":"I discovered the other Scottsdale Modern Market with a friend who was familiar with it. I found out that there was one not far from me that was opening soon, so I made sure to attend the Grand Opening on March 26. This is my new favorite place. The food is fresh and prepared so well that it's hard to believe how affordable it is. Preparation doesn't take long, and eating on the patio is a real treat. When it gets warmer, the misting system will be used, so comfort -- even outside in hot AZ summer -- should be possible. The employees are, without exception, fun, nice, helpful, and, in general, wonderful. I'm one of those people who find a place, love it, and usually order the same thing, so I'm sure they will know me well before long. OH -- get the app for your smartphone and you can order ahead!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch at Modern Market Today. Excited to something new, but I have have to give it another try, I had a Merida Salad I could not pronounce it (dah, hate names I can't pronounce)  The salad was tasty, I like tomatoes and non came with this salad, But it did have avocado, roasted corn, organic beans, blue corn chip crumbs, cotija cheese and 3 thin slices of chicken. Here's the thing, I felt the 1/2 salad should have had more chicken and the romaine needed a little more \"romaine hearts\" in the mix. (What's the point of having romaine if it ain't crunchy I hate the green ends) I ate it though and the dressing was different \"guajillo Linme Vinaigrette I still an not sure what was in the dressing. So anyway I will give it another try with something else, The Brick oven pizza looked yummy. Fresh Coffee on Tap. They are politically correct having 2 unisex restrooms. I hate using a restroom a man uses but that me I can hold it and go elsewhere (Marshall is across the street) 1/2 salad and beverage is $10.50 oh yes and you can see the calorie breakdown on your receipt."}
{"text":"Modern Market just opened today and there was limited seating throughout the day.  This is the second one in the area, the other one is near Old Town Scottsdale.   The food was tasty and very much like Flower Child and offers healthy but tasty choices.  They have Grain Bowls, Fresh Salads, Toasted Sandwiches, Pizza and Soups.   What's really neat, was the list of Calories, Proteins, Fats and Carbs on your receipt. I thought it was pretty cool to see it there in black and white.  We had the Pulled Pork for $8.90 and Chipotle Steak at $10.40, both (photos) were incredibly flavorful. Our bill came to $22.99."}
{"text":"While the food was tasty, the portions were ridiculously small.  I ordered a type of beef sandwich that cost just under $11.  It was a very small sandwich and was accompanied on the plate by three thin dill pickle circles and literally about a teaspoon of some kind of purple cabbage slaw. That's it!!!   The same  was true for my wife's sandwich, too small and overpriced.  Seriously, that meal would have been about $7.50 across the freeway at Jason's Deli.  Jason's has considerably more variety and the portions are a lot bigger and the food is as good, if not better.  I shall say, in all fairness, that the service at MM Eatery was quite good.  They need to adjust their pricing and their portions."}
{"text":"Great menu options and very friendly service.  Try their different soda options!  My favorite is the Coconut Chicken Salad, but I've yet to have a bad meal at any of their locations.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"This brand new spot is right on point! Loved the pep pizza! The dough was made by them freshly and toppings were fresh and amazing! They have a spicy ranch which is not really spicy but it has a good flavor! I just wish that they had normal ranch for pizzas too! They have cucumber mint lemonade and carrot lemonade which are pretty good and interesting! Never had a carrot lemonade before actually!  I love the design and the atmosphere! It's new, fresh and modern! It's a great spot to hang out with friends and have a great healthy food! I would totally come back and keep in mind that the pricing is not bad at all for this spot!"}
{"text":"Tried the salmon curry and it was delicious. It was just not hot enough and the tomato basil soup had a plain taste! Maybe needed little more spice or something to be more tasty. They have a good variety and the carrot lemonade is great! Can't find that anywhere else! It's a great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite lunch spot.  I've been eating here 2-3 times a week, so much my coworkers are making fun of me.  I almost always get the Farmer salad, which is delicious.  I've also had the pork belly BLT which was really good too.  I like that you can do half Sammy/half salad.  I want to try the brussel sprouts sides too.  Other folks have got the Banh Mi and pizza, those looked delicious too.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today.   The food was awesome and the prices were reasonable.  Got the pesto chicken sandwich and it tasted very good.  Will for sure be coming back"}
{"text":"Food: Nice selection of breakfast foods, all fresh, well prepared and clean we presented, high-quality, good portions, reasonable prices. what they call a \"scramble\" is really an omelette. The broccoli and onion was better than the spinach and bacon. Broccoli was pre-roasted, a little burnt, but tasty. Potatoes are somewhat spicy and delicious. Wanted to try the waffle, has dairy in it, maybe another time. Rating: 8.5 out of 10.  Atmosphere: clean, modern, good open feel with a nice blend of wood and metal, nice finishes, well laid out, bright and comfortable. Rating: 9 out of 10.  Staff: everyone is extremely friendly, positive, dedicated to your excellent experience. We had a couple small incidents with our food and they took care of it before we even noticed, that's what you want, a good sign. Rating: 9 out of 10.  Value: good value at this restaurant for breakfast, less than $10 per person for a nice quantity of food, worth it. Rating: 8 out of 10.  Overall: my breakfast-only rating is 8.5 out of 10. I would recommend this place for breakfast and we'd like to try it for lunch and dinner. Kids eat free after 5:00 PM on Sundays and Mondays, that's pretty compelling, although we need to look at the menus. If lunch and dinner are as good as breakfast, it's certainly worth it. My recommendation; relax, smile, come in for quality food with decent portions, at reasonable prices with friendly staff and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Healthy and fresh food. Served quick for a decent price :) good seating options, all new interior, easy parking. would recommend!"}
{"text":"I LOVE, love, love this place! They have an amazing menu of salads, sandwiches, pizzas and entree platters. Almost everything can be made gluten free and it is all so fresh and delicious! They source their food from sustainable farms and they have the nicest employees. Best part is they have wine by the glass for $2!!! My favorite thing so far has been the Thai chicken salad and gluten free chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there on Sunday and the food was delicious.  It was so fresh and healthy with great flavor.  The atmosphere was clean looking and bright!! The staff was very helpful as well I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited that this place was open and within walking distance of our home. We went late afternoon and the ambience was great! There was a young man who directed us to the ordering station, thanks for the help! We grabbed a couple paper menus and sat down to decide what we wanted. My wife ordered steak and I ordered chicken. We sat down and waited a few minutes and our buzzer went off. The proteins were both served cold, is that right? This was not an issue as I ate everything! There were three people sitting at a table, they looked like corporate, so I inquired about the temp of the proteins, they apologized and gave me a 1/2 off coupon. Nice touch, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my hubby. The girl at the counter was AWESOME!!! Explained everything to us on how to order....her customer service was on point.   Food was ok. Chicken was dry...not even fresh. Pulled pork was served with soggy pickles and placed on the plate with no passion. Almost felt and smelled like a cafeteria.   We won't be back. Chop House has the same concept and I'd rather go there. Too much competition not to deliver truly fresh food.    Restaurant wasn't packed at all for a Friday night either."}
{"text":"The service is phenomenal, I had three employees checking on me after I ordered a pizza and told them I was allergic to raw onion. The pizza was really good and I am a new fan of this establishment"}
{"text":"Stumbled on Modern Market after having a bad experience at a nearby restaurant.  They had samples of their carrot lemonade and cucumber lemonade as well as their oatmeal cranberry and chocolate chip cookies - all were delicious.  We were greeted by Anthony who explained the concept of the restaurant and we promised to come back the next day for lunch.  As promised, we went back today for lunch...OMG is all I can truly say to describe the absolutely fantastic experience and food.  Again, Anthony greeted us and said he was glad to see us back.  The three of us ordered different things so we could try them.  From the potato, leek and green onion pizza, which made all of us coo, to the Superduperfood salad, the Farmer salad, and the Chipotle Steak sandwich all the way to the Smoky Chicken Bowl...UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  Chicken was tender, juicy and seasoned just perfectly, the steak was tender and flavorful and the combination of flavors matched perfectly.  While we were dining, Jena stopped to ask how we liked it, to which we told her that we would definitely be back often.  She then told us about their rewards program and how that would benefit us.    Modern Market - we are very impressed with your customer service, your training and last but certainly not least your food.  Thank you for all you do.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"My absolute stop in spot. It's quick and fresh but most importantly healthy. The mint cucumber lemonade is to die for. I eat lunch here at least three times a week, inexpensive and great."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out this morning. I really wanted to like it. Snooze is opening next door in a couple of weeks and they are going to have stiff competition. Unfortunately, it was just not that good. Certainly not worth a second chance when I could go to the Living Room or Snooze in the same plaza.    The food was ok, a little bland. The potatoes were undercooked and the toast was served cold with cold butter.  They do not have standard condiments like Tabasco to help overcome the blandness and seemed annoyed when I asked for it.   The most disappointing part though, for a restaurant that serves breakfast...the coffee was terrible. Both my husband and I had one sip and put it down. It had a strange sour taste. And then to make it worse, they do not even have cream to add to the coffee.   Maybe they are still trying to work the kinks out. Hopefully they do it soon."}
{"text":"Good time for a good review. How about a great one? I was hungry drove around and saw the bright yellow look of Modern Market and they had a canopy to match so I went in. I did go to the one in Ahwatukee prior and it was good this location was great.   Nick from corporate actually greeted me outside then came inside and made the initiative to come and asked what I ordered. Super friendly and when I asked, gave me some background on the restaurant and how much it's grown.   The staff was also very nice. Carrie the manager came over and talked with me as well. Asked my name, offered to help with any questions, told me how excited she was for the opening. Good vibes and great service to set a high expectation and it infiltrated through the staff.   I had the Thai Coconut Salad which had chicken in it. The chicken was seasoned great and I got extra Thai sauce and it was the perfect amount.   I love the concept. Open kitchen, \"modern\" no pun intended, clean, contemporary and very bright. All that was a great food experience and I had an enjoyable lunch. Since it was their launch opening they handed out this bacon corn pizza and it was money. I will probably order it next time.   Good stuff going on here and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I haven't dined in so my review my not be the best to go by if dining in. My coworkers and I ordered lunch from here. We walked over from our office and our food was ready and waiting on us on a side table near the door. My only concern would be that anyone could really walk in and grab food that isn't theirs because of where it's sitting. The food was very good. The salad I had was called the Farmer. The grapes and feta have it a really nice flavor!! I had the corn on the side though. I would definitely return when I'm in the mood for something on the healthier side"}
{"text":"I went Saturday morning for breakfast with the free meal offered through eventbrite (I saw a ad on my Facebook). Anyways I figured the menu sounded good and it was close so I would try it out! The menu is really nice. Healthy with odd combos, but simple too. Oh so tasty.  I had the chili eggs. So delicious. It was green chili with some shredded chicken on top of 2 eggs over medium (scrambled is the other option). Potatoes. And a slice of whole grain bread. The bread was so yummy. I loved it. All of it was perfect and the amount just enough. I finished every bite and was perfectly full.   The staff was very friendly. You can tell that even after being opened for a while the people they have hired just have a good personality.   The set up is really cute and casual. I actually ate alone lol. It's a nice vibe and I love the succulents on the table!!! It's super cute and I will def be going back to try out more items!!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I tried Modern Market for the first time last night because I saw an Eventbrite for two free meals. I'm really glad we got to come try it, we'll definitely come back! We got the m'rita pizza and the Merida chicken salad, both were so good! :) they give you really big portions, too.   Heads up if you don't like thin crust pizza though, it's super thin here."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and love it! Food is fresh and delicious. I love the the market salad topped with such good chicken. Very good place for a casual meal. Parking is a nightmare so brace yourself for that."}
{"text":"Lunch with my family & mom after church. Kids ate their pizza entirely, mom had broccoli and cheddar, chicken basil sandwich, I had the steak & farmers salad w/medium dressing & husband had green chile soup w/chipotle sandwich. We all left completely satisfied and price is pretty average but decent portions to be full but not stuffed. Inside is kept nice & cool, they have table tops and tables for 4 but easily fit more if the booths are available. Outside seating looks nice, for when the weather is nice lol Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast so I can't comment on anything but that. However, their breakfast is amazing. They cook the eggs perfectly every time. Their potatoes and sausage/bacon are always wonderful as well. And they have great coffee. The food usually comes out pretty quickly and the servers have all been nice. Definitely a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my husband on a Sunday morning and let me tell you, Modern Market's breakfast is outstanding, delicious and fresh. I'm vegan and my husband is not, so it was so great to have both options on their menu! Everyone is always so helpful and friendly and we'll make this our regular breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"First time here and Stopped by for lunch. Food is healthy. I had superfood salad and chili chicken soup. I enjoyed them both.  I didn't give this place a high rating as my soup bowl had a crack in it and I think this brings the hygiene standard of a restaurant down. I would come back and try it again as I had no complaints about the food."}
{"text":"Came here with our friends for dinner before heading over to the escape room. Everything here is so clean nand healthy. It is amazing how they have balanced flavor and lower calories. We were very impressed.   Bhan Mi was good. Hood balance of flavors.   Smokey chicken bowl. Very good. Nice and smoky but not over  Lemongrass pork bowl. This was out favorite. Pork.wss nicely shredded. Perfect balance of flavors. Very satisfying.   BLT+A: bacon was very good. Good flavor.   Combucha pink lady apple: wow this was good. I wish they would bottle this in large bottles to take home.   Corn and bacon pizza was outstanding. Wow I wish traditional pizza places offered this combo. Really outstanding. Would come back just for this.   Service 5/5. Food 5/5. Overall 5/5. We have been back twice since I started this review."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is right next door to Snooze. Snooze was a 10-15 min wait, loud and crowded...so we decided to try this spot....  Nice ambiance. Quiet. Small menu but food was not bad. Fresh and good."}
{"text":"Was hoping this was going to be another good addition to the Scottsdale area and looked forward to its opening. I was very disappointed.  There really is no service at this restaurant. Although the food is somewhat tasty, the process leaves a bad taste. There is no table service, no bar to sit at, it is more like a cafeteria. You order your food at a counter with the only menu behind the register (like McDonald's). You then wait until it is ready and go get it and bring it to a table (like McDonald's). When you are done eating you bring your tray and plate to the trash area (like McDonald's). They do have some beers on tap, but if you want a second you need to leave your food on the table, get back on line, and order another.   The food is a bit above average and tasty but really not worth the rudimentary service."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this new restaurant in Ahwatukee. Their menu is diverse enough for everyone young, old, vegetarian, etc.   I've tried 2 different salads. The Thai chicken was my favorite! Portion size was good for a salad but my friend that ordered the protein plate left hungry.   Their pizza crust is as thin as you can get it and the toppings aren't that plentiful either. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't love thin crust.   Serve yourself drink station and but the employees come by often asking if you need refills or anything else. Great friendly service!   Back for Breakfast 8/5/17 If your a meat eating kale lover this scramble is for you!! It was delicious even w/o the cheese. Loved the potatoes and wished for more toast.   The Chipotle Egg sandwich is big enough to share if you wish."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great variety of fresh, healthy foods that all taste great! The farmer salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Just got my flat iron steak salad.  Should be renamed, more gristle than steak. Nice looking place but don't get the steak salad.  The quality of their meat is substandard."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The food is always fresh and made by people with a passion for what they do.  If you talk to the staff, they actually like their jobs.  The blueberry pesto sandwich sounds terrible, but is amazing!  Everything on the menu is delicious.  pizzas, salmon cous cous special was to die for!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas BBQ chicken pizza and seasonal pizza that had feta. Both were about $16 and filled me up. Pizza was excellent quality and cooked in front of me. Pear beer was tasty and so were the oatmeal cookies. Friendly service and quick too !"}
{"text":"In part of town better known for pretension and price there is a family-friendly option that serves as an outpost for the average Joe as he looks to take the wife and kids out for a weekday dinner.  Great price point, relatively healthy options, and a suitable variety that keeps everyone happy."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and salads with a nice outdoor section. Also have a nice breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. I have been now for breakfast and dinner and I love both. I love their cold brew for breakfast. It's delicious! At dinner, the house wine for $2 bucks is pretty decent. Good healthy breakfast. I ordered the market scramble. The pizza and Cesar salad is pretty good too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I work in the area and eat here several times a week. Very fresh, healthy, and affordable. Service is always great. Excellent breakfast as well."}
{"text":"I was so pleased to see a Modern Market open up in Scottsdale! My dad requires a low sodium diet and unless you have actively looked for that before with nutrition facts you likely don't realize how difficult it is to find! It's common for him to only be able to have one item (or none!) on the menu at most places and at Modern Market provides such a variety, not to mention is so easy to research on their website. The pizzas, salads, sandwiches are all fantastic and I love the $2 glasses of house wine. The location in Scottsdale has a great patio, easy parking, and quick service. We've been four times already!"}
{"text":"A delicious, unique spin on fresh and healthy food. I have enjoyed every single dish I have ordered because I know it is prepared with quality ingredients. I drive all the way from the West Valley for their salads and sandwiches- it's amazing! AND they include the macro intake on ALL of their dishes!"}
{"text":"First time here and had been looking forward to the opening as it is within walking distance from my office. I ordered the full toscano salad and toward the beginning of eating it I noticed the end of the cucumber slice had plastic on it. I'm familiar with English cucumbers having a plastic covering and was glad I didn't end up accidentally eating it. I nicely let the front order taker know and brought the cucumber and plastic up to her which she showed her shift leader. They both came over and had offered either a replacement salad which I declined or asked what they could do. I said a free lunch for my next time in would be great as it's my first visit and I work so close.   The order taker and shift manager still hadn't apologized and she had said she'd bring something over to my table. I waited and received a Buy one Get one coupon for next time. And a \"sorry\" as she walked away. I'm not sure I'll return. It would've been nice to receive what I asked for or just a straight compensation for the salad.   Maybe they're still working kinks out from just opening but better service when something goes wrong is definitely a great place to start"}
{"text":"Just ok..I had the salmon plate with sweet potato mash. Not horrible, but not great. It's a spin on fast-food healthy dining. Don't let the name fool you, it's not a market. You go to the counter and order and wait for your order with a buzzer. Lots of menu options and the staff was friendly and helpful when ordering, but as for the food, I would probably not return."}
{"text":"This is a counter service venue. I enjoy the hea lthy options on the board. It is a,good concept but needs a little bit of fine tuning.  The front open air room that views Scottsdale Road is fantastic. However, when I went in there, the tables were not wiped down. Even if it is counter service you need to clean and sanitize career people finish their meals.  My egg and cheese sandwich was very good and the bun they used had a light air like quality with a slight crunch to it.   The coffee (to me) was very acidic and had a bitter after taste. I'm a huge coffee consumer. I was looking for something a little more robust and flavorful. They have to go cups for you but both myself and another joked about our ability to get a lid out of the holder they keep them in. It was a struggle for both of us but a good introduction tool.  The back patio is fabulous and presents ample seating for decent size groups. All in all this is a pretty good place to go. With a few tweeks, this place could really shine!  Ps. The staff were very nice and helpful.   #irishcatv2 #rebelfoodandwine #vino2ultimate #vinosquared #vino2  #jimsboisset  The outside"}
{"text":"The food is good. A lot of healthy options. I got the coconut curry salad and it was really good. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Modern Market made its way to Old Town in 2017 and I was super excited. I love my healthy eats! There's a nice big deck on the back if you want to sit outside. I was crazy about the inside. Very plain, fast food style set up. Now for the food. I tried their salads, soup, and pizza. The salads were rather small and dense and the pizza was very plain. Again I like to try places a few times before I give my review. I just wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! One of the best fresh breakfasts I've had in a long time. The peppered sweet potatoes are my new fave!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh restaurant in Ahwatukee. The seasonal summer pizza with zucchini was really good. The meat and veggie plate was good."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for lunch and upon eating my salad noticed there was a metal screw in the salad! Shocked by this I stopped eating and took  the salad to one guy who worked there (not sure if he was the manager even because he didn't introduce himself) .He simply offered to only pay for the meal which he of course should have done in this case , but I honestly expected more. Like a couple free meals or something so I could give them another chance in the future. I hadn't even finished my salad so I was still hungry after. Had I chipped a tooth on the screw that would be a big problem...especially this place being so new..He said he was embarrassed and that the screw came off the machine that chops the strawberries and that the cooks combed though the berries but never found it. Now wouldn't you think if you knew a piece was missing and didn't find it, to throw out all the berries rather than risk a customer to find it in their meal? Or cause a tooth injury? Overall disappointed and not sure if I'll be back/would like to recommend to others at this point for the way this was handled."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for a birthday lunch. I Had a great Thai coconut salad my wife had something with corn and beans we both like that's all that's going on very much the design of this place is fantastic. Price is really good."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting to be honest , I got the tofu potatoes and Caesar salad all of it was gross it had such a weird taste the tofu could have been flavored differently the potatoes didn't taste good it was just not good"}
{"text":"First time here, came in at eight in the morning on Wednesday. Good service, the food is pretty good. But it was really cold inside.  The chili and eggs were fantastic! I will be back. But with a sweatshirt."}
{"text":"I ordered the flat iron steak salad. Probably the best salad I've ever eaten. The steak was cooked to perfection, the dressing was amazing, I would recommend it to my mom :) she knows what food should taste like!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Kind of like Zupas, but with a more modern and fun atmosphere. I loved the style and decor of the restaurant :)   We came for their recent opening deal and each got a meal for free. We tried the M'Rita pizza and the Merida salad, and both we delicious. You get a lot of food and it was really filling, too! We'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great place! Very friendly,and food is so fresh. I love this salmon salad, and the pork sandwich also delicious!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant concept. A healthier, guilt free choice for my family and I. I Usually order the salads, with extra greens ( no extra charge ), but we have tried the pizzas, entrées, sandwiches, and they are all very good. Staff is friendly and efficient. I love the app on my phone that I pay with, and the discounts that I receive for repeated visits."}
{"text":"I am so pleased that Modern Market opened in North Scottsdale! I work in the area, and until recently there was a lack of fast, modern, healthy places to eat.  Modern Market is bright and cheery. Their customer service matches their decor, and you are always greeted with a welcoming smile .  They have a lot of great healthy options, but my faves would be the \"comfort plates\" where you choose a protein (sliced steak, salmon, or free range chicken), and two sides, which range from sweet potato mashed to mixed greens. If you're craving healthy, but not TOO healthy, you can add their delicious Mac n cheese. I always choose the steak , because it's just so darn good and cooked to a perfect medium.  My other Go To is the steak sandwich, (are you detecting a theme here? ;-) )which is served on soft ciabatta bread, with arugula and a very spicy chipotle spread. It is absolutely fantastic!  If you're not wanting a whole sandwich, you can purchase a half, or pair it with a salad or side. They even offer half pizzas !  This is the perfect spot for lunch or a quick healthy dinner on those nights you just can't bring yourself to cook after a grueling day at work.:-)"}
{"text":"A very interesting concept restaurant that caters to the healthy eater, complete with healthy choices and nutrition information on your receipt. Our kids even ate well (always a bonus)"}
{"text":"I've been to and rated the other modern market before, was so excited to see this one pop up closer to me! I think I like this location even better than the other one. Seems like quicker service! So I got half a blueberry pesto sandwich, my favorite. It was delicious as always. I tried two new things, the pb chocolate chunk cookie and a cup of sweet potato curry soup. That was probably one of my favorite soups I've had before! Cookie was yummy too. And reasonable prices. Everything was really fresh too! I'm excited to come back."}
{"text":"Sad to see the poor reviews so far. I am so glad I tried this place! My dad and sister were in town and my dad found this place for us to try. They had a ton of options! I'm used to only having a few, but there were multiple vegetarian soups, sandwiches, pizzas, and other meals. I wanted the pizza after hearing the dough was made there but decided on the blueberry pesto sandwich because I've never tried something like that! I also had a cup of the butternut cashew soup. Everything was delicious! Sometimes butternut squash soups have a weird baby food type texture, but this soup wasn't like that it all. It was perfect! The sandwich was very tasty as well, a good combo of flavors on yummy crunchy ciabatta bread. My dad got the m'rita pizza, I had a little bite and thought it tasted great. I really wanted to try the kale crimini pizza, but I'll save that for next time. My sister got a salad and a chicken sandwich and liked it all. The people next to us got Mac n cheese and it looked so awesome, I was a little jealous. There are so many things I have to go back and try! The service was super fast too. And a cute atmosphere with a little patio. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"After only one visit, Modern Market secured a coveted spot on my favorites list. The food and service were awesome!"}
{"text":"Got the privilege to  try them out for breakfast.  Food was wonderful.  Served hot, fresh and fast.  The menu had many great items, choosing was the hardest part.  Will have to go back to try out the lunch menu.   Check out the self service lemonade choices,  great mixtures and the taste is beyond words."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I ordered a salad with beef called their flat iron salad. Very tasty! Meat was tender, the greens were fresh and all the staff were helpful. I will come again!"}
{"text":"I'm eating at another restaurant nearby and this place is messaging me on Facebook. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"$3.50 for a local beer, up to $5 bucks for local wine this is smart pricing.  Chicken or beef plate with some of the best chim churri sauce and two sides between $11 and 13 (rounding up) quality more then quantity but outstanding quality.  New favorite and now we have to get a Lyft for we couldn't say no to a few Beersheba that price."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how much I liked this pace.  We got a Pepe pizza, which was of decent size and good quality.  Be warned, the dough was quite yeasty, but it was still tasty.  Also got a bbq pork sandwich that came on brioche with a side of pickled red cabbage, which was pretty flavorful.  They have Boylan soda and had three kinds of lemonade -  who knew carrot and lemons mixed so well?"}
{"text":"I was in for lunch and had a nice meal.  It was a short wait to order at the counter and then they give you a buzzer that goes off when your food is ready to be picked up.  I had the chipotle steak sandwich and sweet potato chips.  The steak sandwich was good and I really liked the seasoning and spice level of the sauce on the sandwich.  The restaurant is long and narrow which presents a challenge.  The silverware, napkins and drink machine are all the way on one end and if you are in the main indoor dining area, or good forbid the back patio, it's a long walk to refill your drink.  Overall I had an OK lunch but I'm not doing cartwheels over this place."}
{"text":"So far not so good :( I work nearby so I was very excited for a new spot. Have tried the prosciutto salad that was very mediocre and the tofu plate which was horribly seasoned and waaaaay over salted. I had to scrape the salt off because it was so intense. I love that they have kombucha on tap but 2 out of the 3 times I went over to get it, they were out. I hope they get it together because the competition of farm fresh deliciousness in scottsdale is way better other places."}
{"text":"This place is... decent.  I work in the office building across the street so it's a pretty logical place to eat lunch.  I'm glad I have a variety of salads to choose from, but I HAAAATE that thing they do on the receipts and menus that show the nutritional content.  First of all, who is doing these calculations? Are they correct?!  And Second, whyyyyyy is there more than 100% of my daily fat and sodium intake in one of these salads?  Their portions aren't that big.  It's like a handful of lettuce.  Howwww is it this unhealthy?  And before you say anything, I get light dressing on the side!!  This makes me hate eating.  So, in summary, none of the food is really that bad, but I feel passionately negative about their stupid receipt, so... three stars."}
{"text":"First time visit. It's bright and cheery. The service was decent. Not great and not bad. He was nice but a little aloof. The food was pretty good. Best part of the experience. We had a salad and sandwich. I'd eat both again, although the sandwich was the better of the two. The only negative was almost every table was dirty. Dishes on them and not wiped. I'd say 80% were dirty. To me this speaks of lack of management at that time. The one guy cleaning had too much to do. I'd certainly return and give it another go. Four of five stars."}
{"text":"Interesting place.  You order at the counter and they give you a buzzer to come pick up your food.   I guess it beats yelling.    Had the wintergreen salad but it was missing the apples.  Considering apples are a main ingredient that was a bit disappointing.  Ordered the chicken sandwich but their bread delivery hadn't come yet so they didn't have ciabatta bread. Mind you it was like noon already so I'm sure it was only slightly delayed.  Lemongrass pulled pork was pretty good."}
{"text":"I want to like this place for many reasons, the convenience to shops I frequent and I like the store on the 16th Street mall in Denver. The kinks still need to be worked out. The staff has been friendly, kind and eager to please.   I really like the cartel cold brew, the various lemonade drinks and my fav dish is the Thai coconut chicken.  The cookies don't meet my expectations, but the food does. P.S. less sugar, salt and pepper."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time and looooved it. The staff was amazing and the food was great!! They went over the top to make sure my first time in the market was a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free items easily marked on the menu. Nice kombucha made fresh. I had the chicken, garlic potatoes, and arugula salad which was wonderful. Nice portion sizes. Husband has same but roasted veggies instead of salad.  Got gf chocolate chip cookie to go for later.  I was surprised this place didn't pull up on gf places to eat when I searched. Nice little find!  I refer to this area as Awahtukee so may be the reason it didn't pull up"}
{"text":"Corn bacon pizza!!! So so good. Also cucumber mint lemonade. My husband had the pork bowl which was just alright, but that pizza is a STAR! I want to try more items but I can't help getting the pizza each time. Crowded at lunch so we had to eat on the patio, but the misters kept it pleasant and the food came quickly enough."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Eat Well Be Happy, but the place contradicts their motto and many areas can use improvements to make this a five star restaurant. Their website talks to helping people eat healthy and clean eating at reasonable prices. Basically, eat well to feel good. They  have a holistic view on health and believe \"added sugar is the devil and (good) fats (needs clarification since saturated fat myths have been debunked) are our friends.\" But a lot of stuff in the restaurant has cane sugar.  I don't even consume sugar since I'm on the keto diet. I might be an bit critical considering I'm a publicist.   The service could be better. As a first time customer, I didn't feel as welcomed considering I sensed an bit of intolerance to have to explain how the restaurant works, but even when I told the cashier it was my first time he just asked me what I'd like to order. No real welcoming message/script upon entering or at the register. I felt rushed to order. So I just picked my usual breakfast sunny side eggs and bacon not realizing it comes with potatoes and whole wheat toast, peppered tomatoes slices. The place isn't the typical restaurant. You order at the front, get a buzzer, and you pick up your food at the Pick up bar a little past the register. I walked away after paying not realizing the cashier was getting my cold brew coffee and I had wandered to find a seat and walked back after seeing him hold a cold brew coffee in his hand with no lid.   I had to figure out where the self service water fountain area and utilities were which is to the left middle wall of the restaurant interior. No instructions were given. So you have to go to the self serve area to get a lid, be careful not to spill your drink on the way there!   I took a seat on the high bar near the self service area to get a good view of the pick up area and close to the condiment shelf where you pick up what you want: organic ketchup, Siracha, extra napkins, Parmesan cheese shaker, sea salt and pepper grinder, pepper flakes, Mike's hot honey (haven't tried it, assuming it's a bit spicy), Frank's Red Hot, and Cholula Original. That's a pretty good assortment of spices to choose from!   I give them some credit for making this place healthier than most restaurants. It's nice to see they use 100% recycled napkins, organic ketchup, Stevia (sweetener packets), almond milk (great alternative to milk, but it's probably original with sugar), seasonal menu, ingredients are sourced from farms not those gross factories. But it's a bit contradictory considering the Heinz organic ketchup has sugar, so does their fruit preserves, their fountain of drinks are made with cane sugar, it even says so on the machine. I hope they aren't telling people cane sugar is healthy because it's the cause of many inflammatory diseases, not to mention diabetes.  Pros: reasonably priced, food is quick to come out, made from scratch, great for a group of friends with different diets to come eat together. It's a place that welcomes people with all diets, \"satisfies virtually any dietary requirement - vegan, celiac, paleo, raw, south beach, high carb, low carb, and also low GCI.\" But be aware of what you are ordering. If the cashier had explained to me the restaurants philosophy and menu I would have asked about toast being gluten free or asked for alternative options so I'm ordering a Keto friendly meal.   My meal: Eggs and Bacon w/ cold brew coffee (decent). I ordered eggs sunny side up over easy. The rest was set. The toast was a bit hard, also not in my diet. Eggs were ok, smaller than the pasture raised organic ones I buy at Sprouts or Wholefoods. Bacon was very thin (also way too peppery) and isn't as good as the organic Wellshire stuff I cook at home. The tomatoes were too peppery, and the Bonne Maman has brown cane sugar and lots of it (only 50g of fruits were in 100g of fruit preserves, that's not very healthy). Overall, this is not a dish I'd order here again and I will stick to eating eggs and bacon at home. I should have asked the cashier what he recommends for first timers.   After I ate, the same guy at the cashier took the tray off my table, but he was too busy to ask how I liked my meal or if I was done (even though I am getting up, it's always polite to ask). When I said \"thank you,\" he didn't reply.  Staff here seemed too occupied with their tasks to focus on the people dining inside.   In the business of hospitality, service is extremely important and since neither my meal nor the service was good I give it 2 stars. The two stars is for attempting to make this a healthier place, cleanliness, & having sourced their food at great places as well as using recycled napkins. Staff here need better training in mindfulness and awareness and service, as well as some scripting to go with the brand message.  I'm hoping to see some improvements here next time I return. I'll have to see what's recommended for someone on a high performance ketogenic lifestyle."}
{"text":"I went here by fluke looking for \"Healthy Food\". Man, I am so glad I found this place!  I ordered online super duper salad, side veggies (eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, something else rutabaga or parsnip or some other root veggie?) Gluten free chunk cookie. Sooo good.  Again, a bit out of my neighborhood but the entire online ordering process really amped it up for me.   I placed the order and it was ready within 10 minutes. There on the shelf for pick up. Had I known, I wouldn't even have had to talk to the employee working.   The salad fed a hunger I've had for months and the side veggies really ensure that I covered all of my bases....   I wish more places would pop up that offer real food... guess, I'm just in the wrong part of the valley for all of thst."}
{"text":"Three of us got meals, all were great except for they charged us for to-go packaging, which we thought was ridiculous. We all had the same size containers but all charge different packaging fees. That leads us to believe it has nothing to do with the packaging but instead the cost of the meal and this doesn't seem right..I would have given it 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"Service was great food was bland and cold. Very similar to what you would expect to get from a self serve Whole Foods breakfast bar (after its been picked over)."}
{"text":"We went to the opening of this new location last month. We got the pizza with pears on it. I seriously don't think I have ever had a better pizza! It blew me away! The coconut salad was pretty amazing too. The owner of the chain was there meeting people and was very friendly and genuine. I was impressed that he took the time to really visit with customers -like seriously would spend ten minutes just chatting with you.   We returned his week to try out some of the vegan options. We got the coconut salad with tofu and the kale pizza. Not going to lie the kale pizza wasn't half as good as the pear, but it was vegan so... yeah.  Great place. Very friendly staff. Would recommend."}
{"text":"It is miserably freezing cold in this restaurant. I've been there four times and it's always cold.  The food and service is very good. Gluten free options are great. We'll give it another try on a warm day when we can eat outside if it's too cold inside. Thank you"}
{"text":"It's a great concept, and the menu is a good menu with good prices. However I have been here a few times and the food is just dry, always have to ask for fresher vegetables (which I love the medley when cooked correctly) and the meat tends to be dry as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorites and a staple for me right now. I'm getting myself back in shape and carefully watching everything I'm eating and drinking. Modern Market helps me do that with balanced meals and calories of all food items listed on the receipt. They have an app that allows you to pre-order and gives you discounts. The menu isn't overwhelming, has a nice healthy array of choices and even some \"treat\" items. Service is fast and friendly and the food is delicious. I can always count on a satisfying healthy meal here. My go-to is the Superfood salad (full portion) sometimes with and sometimes without chicken, and a glass of Kombucha."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try after it being bookmarked for so long! To be honest, I had high hopes and was expecting something different and not your average eatery since my friends swore on it!   The girl that took my order told me their popular item was the chipotle steak sandwich. I decided to give it a try! I ordered the chipotle steak sandwich with a side of the arugula salad. The steak was very chewy and not the greatest I've had. The salad wasn't anything special either. They do have a cool lemonade bar/stand with 3-4 different types of lemonades ranging from cucumber mint, carrot lemonade and a few other tasty ones!   Give this place a try, it might be a different experience for you"}
{"text":"Great food and great price. For breakfast I had the egg and sausage platter. For lunch I had the steak plate and half-size truffle potato pizza. This will definitely be a go to place for me."}
{"text":"We tried this place without reading the Yelp reviews and I'm glad we did. We are always looking for a place with good vegan options for my daughter  and this place has many. The tofu plate was great. Unlike Flower Child, the tofu is well seasoned and crusted with sesame seeds. The maple veggies and lemon garlic asparagus were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The crimini kale pizza was delicious! Kids eat free Sundays and my son enjoyed the half pizza with nitrate free pepperoni. I had the eggplant goat half sandwich and really enjoyed it. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Looking forward to trying breakfast and happy they are opening one in the Promenade!"}
{"text":"They're ok. The first time I came I enjoyed it, I had a 3 cheese pizza and blue cheese and arugula salad which was very potent so I had to swap it out for mashed potatoes which are really good here but that's about it and the associate was very nice and let me swap the items for no extra cost. Had the salmon home plate with Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes- The meal was great BUT I had a startle during eating because there was a bone in the salmon thank goodness I noticed! The salads are meh. I wouldn't pay that much for those mediocre lettuce which you could make a better bowl of at home I bet. I was so annoyed this last visit, my salad was so dry, barley got romaine, more kale than anything. Their ranch is not ranch, don't get it. Lol The pizza is SUPER THIN, looked semi similar to the photos but they're like paper thin and the sauce is watery. I hate that, I like creamy sauce. Customer service is good, very nice place, I like their patio seatings. Nice ambiance but overpriced for lunch. Idk if I'd come back for a meal... I'll def come back for their Coda Cola and mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese. Dats It Doe."}
{"text":"I just discovered Modern Market thanks to a friend and I quickly fell in love! They use locally sourced products so they're always fresh and their menus vary per location because of this. That being said - everything is so DELICIOUS. It tastes so fresh and it is so beautiful when it's served. The flavors just burst in your mouth! Their lemonades are also incredible - carrot lemonade was crisp and refreshing and it has little to no sugar added so I felt great drinking it. I left feeling more than satisfied because the portion sizes are just right and the food is whole and real and just so good.   They don't do a ton of marketing so it's really just word of mouth - so do yourself a favor and please try anything on their menus. I have yet to be disappointed and I doubt I'll ever be."}
{"text":"I'M OBSESSED!  I love this place so much after only one visit and can't wait to come back. The location is great with plenty of parking (which we all know can be impossible in Old Town.) It is super cute inside with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. It is also dog friendly on the patios. The menu looks phenomenal and so so fresh. My friend and I came here last weekend for breakfast. I had the breakfast sandwich with chipotle aioli and a kombucha on tap and she had a scramble. We both thought they were really good and appreciated how they listed calories and nutritional information. (No, we aren't THOSE girls but its still good to know.) They also have a variety of fun coffee brews for brunch and iced tea. I thought prices were super reasonable for being healthy and fast. I finally feel like there is a place in Old Town where I can pick up a quick lunch or dinner without breaking the bank and without killing someone trying to find a parking space."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place. This is my second time and beside the food being so good, the staff is amazing. I'm always difficult and challenge the people for fun (in a good fun way) and they were great about it. Joked around, and made sure we were really well taken care of. 5/5 definitely recommend. Food is really good. Super fair priced and you can get half orders of everything."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple times already! The food arrived super fast and they were very busy!! Prices are great! We found seating outside. They have misters which is great but the food was so good and the portions are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Modern Market is a new favorite! The menu offers a wide range of options from salads to pizza but all seem to be on the \"healthy\" side. The thai coconut salad was light and refreshing. The pizzas are great too, especially the crust! I would recommend looking at menu before so you are not overwhelmed  by all the options upon your arrival- there are so many delicious choices. Also sit outside- nice patio."}
{"text":"The place was very clean and the girl behind the registers was very nice and helpful. We ordered the smoked chicken bowl which my husband loved. We also ordered the Thai salad which was also very delicious. The food was served quick and was fresh. Definitely will eat here again"}
{"text":"This is a killer place for fresh, natural, flavorful food. I'm addicted to their BLTA, and a friend swears by the grilled chicken. I've also seen some pizzas go past that looked tremendous!  Four stars instead of five because they're a little slow getting the food out ... but overall a great place for a healthy and tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"Great new location in Ahwatukee. Great menu and chalk full of vegan and vegetarian options. They do a calorie and nutrion update on every meal option. Staff extremely friendly. All around a good meal for the price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service! I LOVE how you can order a half pizza! genius! also, the half salad is a great portion size! this will definitely be one of our go-to spots!"}
{"text":"Well I found my new favorite place in town!! I love the farm fresh concept. I would compare it to a healthier version of Panera...but with way better tasting food!! I was blown away. I got the half pizza and half salad combo with the corn and bacon pizza and I think the salad was the farmer one. Delicious!! Pizza had great flavor and I normally don't like the crust but his crust was just so light and airy and cooked perfectly!! The salad that I got came with seasonal fruit and I typically don't do fruit on my salads but bought I would just try it out today. I pick up my salad and immediately noticed the grapes in it but I was so glad I left it as is! It was phenomenal!! All the ingredients worked perfectly together and I fell in love!! My hubby got the seasonal diablo sandwich and he loved it as well! Although when you order the sandwich alone, it doesn't come with any sides so he wishes that he would have ordered a separate side just to fill him up a bit more. Also, wine for 2 bucks and beer for less than 4! You can't beat that!! Prices were great for the quality of food that you get. Can't wait to go back and try everything else! Especially breakfast!"}
{"text":"Yes, a Modern Market closer to work/home. I love their goat cheese eggplant sandwich. It's so filling and flavorful. I will definitely be a regular here for sure!"}
{"text":"Modern Market is going to be my new healthy go to place! The food here was delicious and their patio cute! I had the half size eggplant goat cheese sandwich and Mac and cheese. I originally ordered the Brussels sprouts as a side but they told me they were out until June I think. What? Why have it on your menu then? Anyway, that was a little disappointing.  The sandwich was divine! It was perfectly toasted and the flavor delicious! The Mac and Cheese was fine. The only thing that I did feel was that the person portions were small. I mean enough for me, but I'm petite so someone whose 6'1 or 200 lbs will probably need to order for two. I also had the hibiscus iced tea and the gluten free cookie and that wasn't bad at all. I really enjoyed my lunch here though and plan to come back!"}
{"text":"Cute place that needs a chance to get up to speed. Went for lunch with my son. Food was super yummy. The server at the cash register got my gluten free sandwich order wrong, but the kitchen fixed it fairly quickly and was very nice about it. Atmosphere was open and airy. They have gluten free, dairy free and vegetarian options. Some of the service was great and some not so great. That being said they've been open for just a couple of weeks and need time to work their kinks out. I'll be back to try their breakfast and their gluten free pizza! Fingers crossed they just keep getting better and better."}
{"text":"Being from Denver, we were so excited to have Mod Market come to the valley! I love the seasonal salads and my boyfriend loves the pizzas- plus, it's great to see the calories of your meal on your receipt. I appreciate their attention to detail (ie: asking me how much dressing I would like on my salad) and the transitional spaces you can eat at throughout the restaurant. I think people giving poor reviews don't understand the concept of a market, versus a restaurant... I would say Mod Market (as they abbreviate it in Denver) is a better and healthier version of Panera... They use fresh farm ingredients, but it's meant to be quick. We love Mod Market and will be back for sure'"}
{"text":"Modern market was a pleasant surprise. Not your typical fast food restaurant. They use fresh ingredients. Only complaint was the steak in the steak sandwich was a bit chewy."}
{"text":"I really loved the food here. The Merida salad was possibly one of the best salads I have ever had.  There are lots of ways to mix and match menu items.  I did think it was a little loud but there were all kinds of seating options including lots of outdoor choices. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Soooo yum! I love how they give you the option to do halfsies combo of pizza, salad, and the sandwiches. Where else can you get half a za??! The guy who took my order Sam was super friendly and helpful. Great service and great food=5 stars!"}
{"text":"Some hits and misses on the menu. This place would be much more attractive is the patio had music and the seating was more comfortable."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant! Very good food that's fast but not fast food. We tried both breakfast and lunch and liked both. Many fresh items to choose from including options to try only half a sandwich which allows you to try several different selections. Great outdoor seating options at both the front and back of the restaurant. Employees were courteous and helpful and the food was prepared and presented very nicely.  We sure wish there was a Modern Market back home!   Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed!! You'll be surprised at the great food and great prices."}
{"text":"This is a decent place with great ingredients. However there are few keto friendly options for breakfast. Nothing to substitute out the potatoes and toast so you are left paying for a lot of food you really can't eat. Other than that the food is good.  Just wish it had some options for me."}
{"text":"I had a free meal from their grand opening so we went around 6pm for dinner and I thought the food was delicious. We got a pizza, mac & cheese, and a steak sandwich. All of it was good. The prices weren't bad either - especially for beer and wine! It did take a while for us to order & for our food to come out but I'm guessing its because they just opened - I'm sure it will speed up."}
{"text":"Great food, a bit in the pricey side for a family but the quality was definitely apparent in the taste. Love seeing new spots pop up in this area."}
{"text":"Came here for the opening and we loved loved their food! I had sweet potato with curry salmon and kale, it was amazing! This is kind of food that I really like, it's fresh, healthy and delicious! My hubby had eggplant sandwich, it was amazing as well!  The cucumber lemonade is my top pick and my hubby's was carrot lemonade.  Everyone here were very friendly except the girls who take orders were kind of nervous and a bit overwhelmed.  Beautiful decor, very airy and chic \"sheek\". We will definitely come back for more. We already told most of our friends to try this new restaurant.  Thank you Carrie and the rest of Modern Market crew for your delicious meal and excellent service! Thank you for the goodies as well, we loved it. Thank you to the girls who greeted us in the front, they were so friendly and sweet!   See you soon!"}
{"text":"The first impression when you enter here is very pleasant. The place is very modern and pretty. The people were very friendly as well. There seems to be good amount of food selection to choose from. We ordered the spinach bacon and plain waffle. The plain waffle was very healthy taste but ok. The problem was the Spinach bacon which was poorly cooked and extremely salty that I almost threw up. It seems like they accidentally pour the chunk of salt or the just don't know how to cook. I hate to write a bad review for such a nice restaurant but the food was that bad!!!!"}
{"text":"Like my predecessor said, this is exactly what Ahwatukee community needed! A breakfast-lunch-dinner fast restaurant offering organic and fresh-from-the-local-farms products. Had their steak platter with garlic mashed potatoes and arugula salad with blue cheese and it tasted so good!!! Everything being served there is organic, even the organic coffee sweeteners are natural, no blue, pink or yellow chemical sweeteners. Even the ketchup is organic! Prices are very good for the quality of food and one can even order half plate or half pizza, depending on their appetite. Great new taste and food in Ahwatukee! Welcome and prosper!"}
{"text":"All i can say is they were very nice so i gave it two stars and the decor was clean and nicely done. We actually had a soft opening coupon and left the majority of our free food (2 entrees). It just wasnt very good. I was hopeful but we went to a restaurant across the street hungry. The food didnt seem fresh and just didnt taste good. I rarely dont eat something free...i wish them the best, maybe breakfast is better. The beer was also not good and it wasnt free."}
{"text":"Very much like Flower child, healthy and delicious. They just open so there were a few kinks, but everyone was super helpful and friendly. I would certainly go back. I tried the wintergreen salad and added chicken and it was great."}
{"text":"The service was really good, the food was okay, I mean nothing worth coming back and downloading their app to become a loyal member or anything like that. I do understand it's supposed to be fresh foods but I just feel like for the price and the servings and the taste it's just not worth the long wait to order. I'd much rather go to nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"First time here, pizza is good BUT literally got 3 pieces of basil on half of a margarita pizza....that's pretty disappointing lol plus the way they cut it or put it in the box, the sauce got underneath so the pizza stuck to the box. Very little sauce too so I don't know if that's normal either :/ I'll try it again but kind of put off for first impression, at least the flavor is there..."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while visiting from CA and it's officially a new favorite of mine. Excellent service and delicious food. I had the Blueberry Pesto Toasted Sandwich and it's one of the best caprese-style sandwiches I've ever had. I got my food to go and it was prepared quickly, but was still so fresh and hot by the time I got back to my hotel to eat it."}
{"text":"If you like to eat healthy, this place is the bomb!  Seriously, my new favorite place to eat in tukee!  Wish I'd taken a photo, but I was starving and my build your own salad looked TOO good!  My daughter got the tofu plate with a side of mac n cheese and the arugula blue cheese salad. She cleaned her plate!"}
{"text":"I always order their farm salad because it's delicious and gluten free. My boyfriend likes to get half sandwich/half salad (it's nice when places let you do half and half). He usually orders the eggplant sandwich, but will change up the salad. They also have good lemonade!"}
{"text":"I love Modern Market.  The rotating menu is a great way to make sure you're not going to bored of the items and everything is always fresh and delicious.    I'm a fan of the pizzas which I never would have tried under normal circumstances.  During their soft opening I figured I'd give it a try since it was free...I've had about 5 since then.  The dough is a little heartier and the toppings are great.  You can split a pizza between two people with no problem.  I've additionally had sandwiches and salads and all have been outstanding.  Again, the menu rotates so recommending specific items isn't really helpful.  Just go and you're sure to enjoy your food.  In addition to the food, the fast casual environment still has the comfort/service of a typical restaurant without the bloated prices."}
{"text":"I felt like I was on a tropical beach island! With Modern Market Eatery's fresh flavorful food, I was taken to another place! It was my first time here today and I got the bacon corn pizza#the half pie which is 3 slices to be exact. It was my appetizer so I'm glad they sell it by the half pies! It was packed with flavor!#So delicious!#A new fav! The bacon complimented the corn & fresh basil well! The crust was so good, that I gobbled it down before I could make my way up to the counter to ask for ranch for dippin'. Hahaha  The steak was so delicious! It was cooked to perfection! The chimichurri sauce was bomb!#Some of the best steak I've tasted! For my sides I got sweet mashed potatoes & Mac & cheese. The sweet potatoes were good. The mac & cheese was okay. It could have used more cheese. I used the green chimichurri sauce on it and it was even better.  I love how all of their fountain drinks are made with cane sugar. I got the lemonade & I kept getting refills. It was refreshingly delicious! The service was great! The staff was friendly & helpful! They take your order at the counter and before you know it, your pager is buzzin' & it's time to up & get your food! For the food to be so fresh, gourmet, & flavorful, I was impressed with the fast service & reasonable prices! Healthy fresh fast restaurant food made easy!#Truly a Modern Market Eatery! Love it! :)"}
{"text":"Food and service were great. We stopped in on a Monday morning when they opened and it wasn't too busy. Nice atmosphere. Food is fresh with healthy options."}
{"text":"This is my second experience at Modern Market. I felt like the Scottsdale locations food was more fresh. The staff was so nice and helpful. I will be back. Carrot Lemonade is to die for! Used there App for 3$ off. And now I will get 10% off every meal. Just have to pay through the App. Super easy!"}
{"text":"My work group came here today and everyone loved their food. I ordered the steak with garlic mashed potatoes and macaroni. It was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The employees were super friendly and patient with us as it took a while for all of us to decide and order."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service and delicious healthy food!  Smiling staff!  They accidently made me a whole mushroom and kale pizza instead of s half, so now I have dinner too! I decided to try this place despite the reviews. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a REALLY good lunch today!  I was out trying to get my 10,000 steps In- not hard to do in Old Town Scottsdale on a gorgeous sunny morning.  Stopped at Modern Market on way back to hotel.  Great location, healthy food and reasonable prices- not always easy to find around here  They have indoor and outdoor seating too.  Nice for this weather.    I had the chicken plate (made with olive oil and a chimichurri with a little bit of spicy kick, the arugula and blue cheese salad (light and yummy) and the mashed sweet potatoes (had to force myself not to eat all those carbs).  Added a $2 Pinot Grigio (4oz perfect for Lunch). Total bill was $14 for a healthy and tasty meal.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with unbelievable food. I think this is my new favorite lunch spot!  I got the Tuscan salad and basil chicken sandwich. Everything was beautifully presented and the order was 100% right even though I asked for additional salad toppings. The staff is courteous and attentive and just our experience was really wonderful. But the food!  That's why we go out to way, right?  You can tell how fresh and high quality the ingredients are and the menu is large enough for everyone to find something they would like without being too large and overwhelming. Great job Modern Market!"}
{"text":"Accidently found this new eatery today after shopping nearby.  Excellent and friendly service, didn't wait long for my fresh made to order salad which was the greeter/cashiers recommendation. I'm not kidding when I say it was the freshest most delicious salad I've ever had. And I've had a lot of salads. Healthy and delicious can be hard to find! Really nice set up and location. I found my new go-to place!"}
{"text":"Fresh kombucha. It is amazing. Service is also fantastic. They have free wifi, but what you'll really come here for is the fresh food. The salads are incredible and the meat is tender and flavorful, not because it was marinated in a sauce that compensates for the dryness or bad texture, but because its quality meat. Also, download the app and get $3 off your first order."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find a place with good service anymore, let alone quality food and prices.  Modern Market is top notch all around in service, good food quality, and reasonable pricing.  Decided to try this place one Sunday evening before close and it is definitely a new go to for me.  I believe i was assisted by Will who may be a manager, he was great and even made recommendations on the menu if I decided to come back for breakfast one day.  Top Notch and a must try."}
{"text":"Unfortunate, nice interior, great cashier, hot dinner was room temperature, assperigass was way over cooked, needed a spoon to eat it, you can usually tell there are issues when the place is about 10% occupied and many of the tables are still dirty.  Very disappointing, won't go back.  Back to Flower Child and True Foods for the healthy eating."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place!  The people are very nice and friendly.  This is a good place to sit and visit with friends.  You will not be rushed out.  I had the Bahn Mi with a small salad.  Both would have been enough on their own for lunch.  The Bahn Mi was good, but not really a Bahn Mi, really more of a really good pork sandwich.  The salad was perfect.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The customer service was great and the Kombucha was so good! I got the green chili soup which was ok but the Thai coconut chicken salad was super good, I also love the macro break down of each item!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to find this place!  They seriously have such delicious, fresh, & satisfying food made from scratch for great prices!  The steak & chicken plates have the most amazing sauce with them plus 2 sides, I usually get the arugula & blue cheese salad, the rosemary sweet potatoes were so good!  As is the Mac n cheese!  For lunch, the chipotle beef sandwich was amazing, and we tried the wintergreen salad.  The drinks are also great choices: organic black tea, tropical hibiscus, fresh lemonades, and real cane sugar sodas!  The staff has always been friendly & accommodating!  The breakfast is also super good & the use vital farms pasture raised eggs which i buy at home too, and can finally feel good eating eggs at a restaurant that aren't cheap junk food.   This is my new second kitchen!  My kids actually love it too!  Even my 3 year old likes the food!  They have organic milk & juice boxes too.   So glad to find this place that makes real food for a real food lover!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to see a Modern Market in AZ open up near me, I used to go to Modern Market all the time when I lived in Denver and I absolutely loved everything about it.   This new location is just as amazing! I have been there 5 fives in the past 4 days. #oopsies The environment and people are so kind, welcoming and seem to really take pride that they work there. I HAVE to give William a shout out because he left me leaving with a smile the other day. He is SO sweet and I could just tell by the short conversation I had with him, he has the biggest heart! Also, Sean from Denver, so awesome and had such a great conversation with him!   I will continue coming back and tell everyone I know about you guys!"}
{"text":"LOVED Modern Market! Tried for the first time today for breakfast and everything was great. I ordered the sandwich and added bacon and avocado.. my friends tried another sandwich(rocket I believe) and a burrito. Although we only had breakfast, everything was REALLY good. They offer cucumber mint lemonade, carrot lemonade and regular lemonade(along with other drinks). The staff were very friendly and the restaurant was spotless. I can't wait to go back to modern market and try some of the other items in the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the space and the seating areas outside. Great place to enjoy the weather. We ordered the curry salmon bowl and the Chipotle steak sandwich.   The salmon bowl was delicious and only 440 calories! The sandwich had really good and flavorful sauce. The steak itself is bland without it. All in all solid 4 and a great place for a meal that's fresh and healthy! Service was quick too!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and I love that they have all your macros listed! Only reason it didn't get a 5th star was because of the breakfast cutoff....I feel if your menu is going to be small and fresh, you should keep Breakfast on the table all day."}
{"text":"Clean and healthy food! Love this place. Would enjoy even more if they added a little more protein to the plates. Otherwise, would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was looking for something fast, fresh, and healthy-ish for lunch in the Scottsdale area and this restaurant had everything I was looking for. They offer sandwiches, pizza, soups, and salads with the option to do half and half. I had a half portion of wintergreen salad and a half portion of eggplant goat sandwich. I was handed a buzzer and off I went in search of a seat.   While there is nice seating indoors, the shaded outdoor patio is quite nice so I took a seat there. When the buzzer signaled that my food was ready I went back inside to grab it, then headed back to the patio. The salad and sandwich were a good portion of food, just enough for lunch. The salad was filled with fresh greens, thinly sliced apple, goat cheese, sweet potato, dates, walnuts, and vinagrette. I enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures and the dressing was lightly sweet.   The sandwich had roasted eggplant pieces, goat cheese, onion, red bell pepper, harissa tahini, and arugula. All the ingredients were good together and I liked that they used multigrain bread. The bread was too oily for me though.  Service was very friendly and I was checked up on to make sure everything was OK.  If I were looking for a quick cheap-ish meal in Scottsdale this would be a good choice for me to dine again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm so glad they joined the Ahwatukee community. I am obsessed with the lemongrass pork bowl, but made into a salad (typically it's a rice bowl). Add the Thai peanut dressing and it's a winner. Staple of my diet. Hoping this place makes it many many years in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I got a 1/2 salad and 1/2 sandwich this evening. Service was prompt, food came quick, and WOW was it good! I had the Thai Coconut Salad and Blueberry Pesto sandwich. Very impressed- I will be back!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken plate with squash and sweet potato. The chicken was so fresh and delicious. Perfectly cooked. I enjoyed the pesto that came with it. The squash had delicious seasoning. Overall, so delicious, healthy and local. Love this place."}
{"text":"Wow.. tasty Vegan and Vegetarian options. The flavored lemonades are fun and tasty to indulge in during a hot dry day in Scottsdale!  My family comes here often to treat friends and family to a light casual dinner!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my kids (5 and 7).  It has a nice little vibe different from most other establishments you'd expect in the Ahwatukee area.  They had a good variety on their menu.  I had the steak dish while my kids had the kids' pizza and mac and cheese.  My son enjoyed his pizza while they both agreed the mac and cheese was meh.  My steak plate was good but small.  (Left feeling hungry.)  Nice place if you're looking for something healthy and light.  The busser/gentleman was particularly friendly."}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh, kombucha on tap... what more could you ask for? They have gluten free, vegan, vegetarian and omn-nom-nom-ivore options. The friendly staff were eager to give new guests the lay of the land with awesome recommendations. They also offer a Boylan soda fountain, made with sugar cane, instead of high fructose corn syrup. Its quick and casual. Order at the counter, a little cafeteria style, but efficient. My group had the pulled pork bowl, which was pretty spice, ala fresh jalapeno. We also tried the mac & cheese, I'll say a little too mushy for my liking but the others enjoyed it. The basil chicken sandwich had very generous proportions of filling to bread ratio = happy sandwich. I'll definitely be back for a fast, healthy meal option."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Or maybe I was hungry and couldn't wait for dinner so I got a small BLT sandwich to hold me over until dinner. Either way... I'll be back! Loved the BLT."}
{"text":"Went to dinner and split a salad and sandwich with a friend. 11 dollars total for a yummy meal. I do think they could try and make the calorie content a little lower but at the same time I understand they are jeopardizing taste at that point. But all and all great window seat looking out, very friendly staff, and so affordable for a quick healthy meal."}
{"text":"I am here for the first time tonight, not impressed. The chicken was really dry and cold, the asparagus was cold too but did have a good taste to it. The Mac n cheese was mushy and was flavorless. The veggies looked like they've been sitting out for days and smelled horrible. The food comes out of a buffet looking table to be scooped from. The BBQ sauce was really good and made it manageable for me to eat the chicken. Mashed potatoes were good according to my sis. Pizza was  just okay."}
{"text":"Modern Market in Ahwatukee is absolutely AMAZING! Great ambiance, food, customer service and very modern...LOVED IT! Can't wait to go again. I, unlike many others, did not get a free meal, I paid full price because I was not aware of the promotion and it doesn't matter to me because the food was so good! I would go back daily if I could!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great for a quick, healthy bite to eat. My friend and I had such a hard time deciding what we wanted to eat because everything sounded so good. We both landed on the Smoky Chicken Bowl and loved every bite. It was very flavorful, not to spicy and satisfied our hunger. We also had a glass of the pomegranate kombucha which was refreshing and was very balanced. I will definitely be back when I am in the area...wishing one would open up in South Chandler!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday and the experience was amazing. Not only is the food real in terms of being organic and non-gmo, it also wasn't too pricy. You are paying what you would at Panera but you're actually getting farm fresh food that isn't frozen and filled with GMOs like Paneras. I'd recommend getting the chipotle steak sandwich, the spicy chipotle aioli is to die for! They also have four peaks beers on tap that are half the price of what other restaurants in old town are selling them for. They have a new customer for life. I'd give this place 6 stars if I could, highly recommended! Oh one more thing, the outdoor seating here is great and the food was only a 5 minute wait!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at modern market three times now, and haven't loved it every time!! Steak sandwich is our favorite followed by the salads. Food is fresh and has great flavor. Staff is also friendly and considerate. Great lemonades too. So happy to be supporting a restaurant that believes in and supports sustainable food production."}
{"text":"I had a free meal, a pizza with BBQ chicken. The dough was undercooked, but I decided not to complain because it was free. The lady I met when picking up my order was pretty friendly, but the cashier was not. The place looks nice, very contemporary, better than one in Ahwatukee. There was a stand with cucumber mint lemonade and cold brew samples."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch and really enjoyed the food! I was recommended the BBQ pizza ($6 for half a pizza) and it was definitely worth the money. The food seems a little more expensive than other places but then again this is Scottsdale and I feel like that's to be expected"}
{"text":"Was craving Modern Market because I love their Mac & cheese, so I ordered it for pick up. Opened the bag when I got home to sweet potatoes instead   Update: The owner has offered a free meal to make up for this mishap."}
{"text":"Saw this place as a hot and new spot in my area. They preach \"farm fresh\" food so I was excited about trying this place out. I read the reviews but wanted to experience the food myself and give them the benefit of the doubt. If you're thinking about doing this too...DONT!   Their marketing is fantastic and the location itself is beautiful. Can't judge a book by its cover.   I ordered a chicken plate with their most calorically dense sides (garlic mash and mac and cheese). My boyfriend got half of a chipotle sandwich and a broccoli cheddar soup. He said his sandwich was mediocre, the bread was over toasted and the steak was tough because it wasn't FRESH. I tasted his broccoli cheddar soup because he complained it was salty. It wasn't that it was salty it just tasted like broth not broccoli or cheddar.  To no surprise (having read the reviews) my chicken was COLD. I understand using cold chicken (that's been refrigerated) on a salad but not as the main protein on a chicken plate. I quickly went up to the employee that had given me my food and asked if it's normal for the chicken to be cold....At first, she said I took awhile to come get my food after I had been buzzed (NOT!) and that maybe the chicken had cooled in that time. Then she changed it up and said that they serve the chicken right off the flat iron to insure it is always served hot. She then proceeded to say that a new one made for me and personally make sure it was served to me hot.    I saw her ask another work to make a fresh chicken serving and make sure it comes out hot. The other work then proceeded to take a cooked chicken that was sitting under a warmer and place it on the flat iron!!!!!! That's not even kosher because they've got their temps all screwed up. Anyone that had a food handlers license would know this! To make matters even worse, the employee came out 15 mins later with a chicken and said \"sorry it took so long wanted to make sure it was piping hot\" HAHAHAHA that chicken was as HOT as that snow storm happening in the Northeast right now!   What's the point of having fresh food from the farm if you don't serve it FRESH! Oh the irony.  I didn't even bother to waste my time and complain again...I just fed the chicken to my dog. He loved it!   The flavor in the garlic mash is the only thing that saved this from being a one star.  It may have just opened but they need new employees already! Do better, hate to see yet another restaurant shut down."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers, we tried them out during their soft opening with a free meal, which of course was delicious. The place was packed at the time, so we didn't even think twice about the time it took before our meal was ready, since any delay would be perfectly understandable.  Downloaded their app, so had a $3 credit to spend to come back. Rainy day today in Phoenix, so we decided to try it today. Ordered the prosciutto + eggs breakfast. Everything on the breakfast menu is near $7, so price wasn't the deciding factor. Haven't had prosciutto since a brunch buffet at the casino years ago, so was really looking forward to it. Prosciutto was so disappointing -- never had such bland pieces of prosciutto. Was the breakfast worth $7, compared to what you can get at many other places nearby? No, not really. Was the quality of the food worth the premium? Not this time. Might give them another try for lunch or dinner before counting them out of our restaurant repertoire -- breakfast there is definitely a no-go for us.  Must mention that the clerk who took the order was as friendly and courteous as could be, as were the other people behind the counter. Food prep time, considering the few patrons there at the time, seemed very slow."}
{"text":"Up the food was just OK . Everything is super super spicy and over seasoned. The sweet potatoes were nothing like what I expected, they wereOver powered with rosemary. My life partners grill cheese was extremely Soggy. My food was cold."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and wonderful for lunch! The food is very fresh and there is a great variety! I had the Thai Coconut Salad and it was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Great food and super helpful/friendly staff! They are nice and quick too which makes it a great place to grab lunch. The chipotle steak sandwich is really good if you're looking for a recommendation!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent...tasty with lots of flavor and plentiful.  I had a grilled cheese with salad and would come back for more.  The bread was the best.  The price was a little high but I would still come back.  The atmosphere was nice but the noise level was a little loud.  It was a little confusing as to the process of ordering, obtaining meal and when finished..thus the 4 star rate.  I highly recommend this eatery!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch last week.  Had the bbq pulled pork sandwich as it was outstanding!  Was not expecting it to be so good!  Love my bbq and this sandwich was right up there!  Really good and interesting lemonade flavors!"}
{"text":"Saw all the reviews about the Grand Opening Eventbrite free meals and you know I'm not about to pass up a free meal at a new restaurant. Ordering note- the steak dinner and the 1/2 &1/2 meals are not included in the Eventbrite deal. Food is decently price and you good a fair amount of food, just enough to get you full but not stuffed. Usually at most places where you order a steak and two sides, the portions are are way too big to finish in one sitting, but here they give you just enough. We had ordered the chicken plate since we were informed that the steak plate was not part of the deal, but they were kind enough to upgrade it because for some reason the chicken was going to take a long time to cook. The steak was tender and juicy, I really like the salsa verde that came with it. It was more like a chimichurri sauce than salsa. We also got the garlic mash potatoes and rosemary sweet potatoes mash for the sides. They were pretty good too. For our second entree we got the prosciutto pizza. Thin crust pizza with a nice fluffy crust. I like the combination of salty (prosciutto) and sweet (pear) it was a good blend with the pepperiness of the arugula. I only wish there was a sauce or ranch to dip the crust in. The drink prices were very reasonable. Draft beer for $3.50, house glass of wine ONLY $2 and regular wine at $5/ glass."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst place I have ever eaten at in fifty two years. The menu seems to very limited. I ordered the pork sandwich, which had an enormous amount of cilantro (maybe they thought it was lettuce), cold pork, pickled carrots (pickled way to much), jalapeño (raw) and some kind of sauce on ciabatta bread. None of those flavors went together at all. I will never go there again. Your better off trying something else. Trust me."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed  Got the curry dish w salmon and clearly the salmon was not fresh....tasted fishy. Service was good but I cannot honestly say I'd be in any rush to go back  Restaurant was clean"}
{"text":"Love Modern Market, but this location (Promenade) has a major lack of parking. Enough of a problem to keep me from coming back anytime soon.  :("}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Lots of salad, pizza, and sandwiches. I tried the Thai Chicken Salad and it was fresh and tasty. Quick service, a variety of food options, and relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch here.  I was dubious at first because any store with the name \"market\" seems like it should not be called an eatery but I quickly changed my mind.  The food was very good, even my picky vegetarian son found many items appealing and he really enjoyed the food.  I can easily see this place becoming an Ahwatukee favorite since the portions are good but not super-sized, which I truly appreciate.  They offer a wide range of menu items that should satisfy the carnivores and vegetarians among us."}
{"text":"This place is such a treasure!!!!  The food so fresh and flavorful.   We ordered the corn pizza and eggplant sandwich.  The pizza crust was fluffy and delicious.  Toppings perfection crispy bacon, sweet corn, Scott cheeses.  The veggie sandwich also had wonderful flavoring.  We choose the multigrain bread.  Both were sooooo good!  We will be back very often!"}
{"text":"Perfect size portions, great tasting food in the steak plate. Right across from Macy's at fashion square so convenient quick lunch."}
{"text":"Pros: lots of potential  Cons: Several   We had salmon Caesar salad, kids pizza and kids make your own salad. The salmon was drier than dust and was a tiny portion. Otherwise, it was a tasty salad, but good god the salmon was obliterated.   Kids salad was ok I guess, but no protein unless you pay an up charge. For 5.50 and no protein, that's a little spendy.   Kids pizza was average.   Employees were pretty unenthusiastic.   Chances are that we won't be back."}
{"text":"The food quality and taste superb. I got steak I love it, the roasted veggies, and potatoes are perfect very tasty. They're so friendly here. The chipotle steak sandwhich great too but very hot! If you like hot try it"}
{"text":"This is an order at the counter and sit down kind of place. Their menu for dinner was comprised of a few different options -- all of which was accommodating to dietary preferences. In my case, vegan.   I had the curry tofu (instead of salmon) bowl. It was quite tasty, but it was pricy for the serving that was given. I found myself still hungry afterwards. Perhaps salmon is more filling? I also tried their kombucha on tap. It's not the best that I've ever had, but it was alright. For $4+ a glass, I think I'd save my money for some better tasting kombucha. Overall, they were clearly working out a few things being they had just opened. Their staff was friendly and accommodating. I'd be willing to give it another try. Ive yet to find somewhere that can do vegan pizzas right....Definitely nice to have a healthier option!"}
{"text":"I recently stayed at a nearby hotel over Thanksgiving weekend and found  myself with friends, eating here quite a bit because the food and patio was divine, delicious and super fresh! I loved the Rocket Egg sandwich - ate that twice! But I also enjoyed their soup of the day and the Thai coconut salad!!! But my main reason for YELPing is, I have to say a huge shout out to all the staff but in particular to ERICA! She went above and beyond to create a special surprise occasion for me---- that brought my guests to touching heart-felt tears. Thank you Modern Market Eatery!!!! I will be back.... !"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at a Modern Market so I didn't know what to expect.  Upon arriving, the restaurant looked really nice.  I liked the outside patio seating.  For some reason I got the impression this was a restaurant with table service. When I walked in the doors, I realized you order at the counter and then find your seat.  Well, that would have been okay except that you cannot read the menu while you are standing in line.  You can't see it until you actually get up to the counter.  I was able to make out some of the menu, but they have huge lamps hanging down that block half the menu.  They need to put their paper menus closer to the door and really should use the wall space when you first walk in to post another copy of the menu.  I did like that they posted nutritional information on the menu.  I knew I wanted a salad, but wasn't sure which one.  The lady behind the counter said the Thai Cocunut was her favorite so that's what I ordered.  I did like that she asked if I wanted my dressing light, regular, extra, or on the side.  I chose on the side.  She then handed me one of those disks that vibrate when your food is ready and told me where I could pick it up.  As another reviewer mentioned, this restaurant is long and narrow.  They put the drinks at the far end furthest away from the majority of the tables and past the counter where you pick up your food.  It wasn't very busy when I was there, but I can see how hectic and congested it could get when they are busy making it difficult to get your drinks.  Once our food was ready, I went to pick it up.  It was a little hectic at the counter and the person handing me my tray seemed rushed to get me my tray and have me move on.  It just felt cold.  I will note that all other interactions with the staff were very pleasant.  When I returned to the table with our large tray, I had to figure out where to put the tray because it was too big to sit on the table with our plates.  I also had to go back and figure out where to get extra napkins since they only gave us 1 napkin for 2 meals.  Hint: there is a dispenser to the right of the counter where you pick up your food.  As for the meals, my cousin ordered the chicken with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  I tasted her mac, which wasn't bad.  The mashed potatoes were super tasty.  As for my salad, it was okay, but I definitely wouldn't order it again.  For a Thai Coconut salad, I don't know where the coconut was.  I couldn't taste any coconut.  There was a wad of carrots buried underneath all the salad instead of mixed in with the rest of the salad.  And the dressing, well that was interesting.  It had a good peanuty flavor, but it was so thick I had a hard time \"spreading\" it on my salad.  It was the consistency of slightly watered down peanut butter.  I'm guessing they apply it with a squeeze bottle if you don't order it on the side, so if you get this salad, definitely don't order the dressing on the side.  All in the all, the visit was fair.  There are definitely some things they can do to make this a better guest experience.  I might try it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating breakfast here.  I love their sausage breakfast sandwich and the coffee is delish.  A farm fresh eatery.  This place isn't hopping like Snooze which is next door but that's what I like about it.  You can sit in the patio, listen to the music and enjoy your breakfast in peace.  I will definitely be back to try their lunch menu.  While I want this place to thrive, there is a part of me that wants to keep this place all to myself.    ***As an added bonus they will be getting the liquor license!"}
{"text":"Awesomely Fresh & ready to go !! We live far but will be back  when we come this way - give me a shout if you want to open in the West Valley"}
{"text":"The set up at this place is similar to a Panera except the food is a million times better and fresher ingredients. I'm a big fan of fast casual where I can order my food and not bothered. Great healthy options and kids menu. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! The food is super fresh and worth the wait it takes to make it. Highly recommend the southwest scramble! It was flavorful and a generous portion. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"So I'm a bit torn. I love the concept of this healthy quick serve eatery. They are very transparent about their ingredients and include the nutrition facts on everything. The service was friendly and quick. I was excited because I don't have a flower child with in 5 miles of me, and modern market is right down the street. The interior is open and modern, albeit mostly empty at 7pm on a Thursday, while I can hear the rustle and bustle of postino's busy dinner service the second I walk out modern markets doors. I'm searching for a word for the food... disappointing is the closest adjective I can come up with. I ordered the steak dinner plate with garlic mashed potatoes and heirloom rice and split peas. The steak was sadly gristly (i'm hoping you can see from the photo, and very oddly unevenly cooked, some pieces were perfectly medium rare, and the pieces right next to it were medium well and almost a completely different color, which makes me think that they were flash pre-cooked and re heated in a microwave or unevenly heated combo oven). The mashed potatoes are spicy. They are LOADED with black pepper, not necessarily bad but just not my cup of tea. The heirloom rice was okay. The only redeeming part of my meal has been the tiny bit of chimichurri sauce. If you ever drive by and wonder \"hmm, I should check out modern market\" you're really not missing out on the food."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place doesn't get at least a solid 4 if not 5 stars.  I have waited to write a review, until I've had a few visits to this place.  We've ordered through door dash three times, and I've gone in person to check this place out.  LOVE IT!!!   It's fresh, it's healthy, it's delicious without guilt.  Their Chicken on anything is fantastic.  It's tender and cooked to perfection.  Never any gross tendons or rubbery pieces.  Their greens are fresh.  The pizza is delicious.  I've tried the Corn and bacon as well as their Kale pizza.  I love their crust!!  If you are trying to eat healthy for the new year this is the place.  Staff is very nice with smiles on their faces.  It's right outside the mall which parking is pretty easy.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Great place."}
{"text":"So tasty - great place for lunch. Not a quiet or intimate joint, but great for a casual bite. Parking is a challenge during the lunch hour though so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Prosciutto breakfast was everything a routine breakfast should be, so 5 stars for a healthy tasty reasonably priced breakfast, cold brew coffee is pretty good also a little pungent but over all a good cup a joe, definitely will be back to try more"}
{"text":"My dream restaurant!  Super amazing healthy, organic, food with the macros (protein, carbs, fat) of each meal on the receipt.  The only order is super easy and they deliver. I have ordered 10 different things and all so yummy.  Plus meals are under $10 which is super hard to find for this healthy and great."}
{"text":"Like the food here, but it can be a little drab. Fairly sized portions. Low delivery fee thru door dash."}
{"text":"Great healthy and convenient option for food! I love that all nutritional info and ingredients are posted for each item on the menu, makes choosing something that works for my diet easy! They cater to all eating lifestyles including vegan, paleo, GF, etc.  I really enjoy the Merida salad and the curry salmon bowl! So far I haven't been disappointed with anything I order. The portion sizes are perfect. The service is quick and reliable, making grab and go super easy. The restaurant is modern and simple, nice outdoor and indoor seating areas and it's never super crowded."}
{"text":"Uhmmmm, It was okay. The customer service, atmosphere, and sheer coolness gets an A+ but the food itself was just...okay. I was really excited to try a promotional meal from here that they were offering on EventBrite (Which I think they still might be doing! Try it for yourself!), and had a great time with a guest, but the food expectations fell flat unfortunately. The presence of the food was impressive but if you like seasoning or flavor, don't expect to get it here. It is as farm fresh as it gets, meaning literal eggs...just toast...and just bacon. I'm not sure if this is what farm fresh just tastes like or if someones heavy handed on the seasoning granny was on a lunch break, but I really expected more PIZZAZZ on the eats, especially given all the hype surrounding it."}
{"text":"Very average food. Just went here with my mom. I got the protein plate with salmon, Mac and cheese, and the sweet potato mash while she got blueberry pesto sandwich. Honestly the best part of the whole meal was the lemonade. The Mac and cheese was dry and flavorless, the sweet potatoes were sickeningly sweet and the salmon was dry. Service was very nice, and the people were friendly. Do yourself a favor and go eat at chop shop across the way. Not worth the money!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before today and it's been good.  Ordered the Pepe twice before and it looked much better than today.  If this is going to be inconsistent every time I go I'll just get my pizza somewhere else."}
{"text":"Haven't actually gotten to try the food yet. The first time I went in with my friend we were waiting in line looking at the menu and the cashier let the line know they were only accepting cash. Then the next time I wanted to go in I called 3 times to ask about the food: 1st call it hung up on me, 2nd and 3rd call had me on hold for 5 minutes each.  So unfortunately I haven't tried the food but that's been my experience so far."}
{"text":"This place is money. Really healthy food. The lemongrass pork bowl will change your life.   Good ambiance. Good service. Friendly people."}
{"text":"Decided to walk across the street to check this new place out.  First impressions where that I was not in love with the layout and how they used the space, it's loud, and I'm. It sure who thought it was a good idea to hang large lighting in front of the menu board that causes you to have to bend over to read it.  But, the staff was very friendly, the food reasonably priced, delicious, and healthy.  I would recommend this place but I'm not sure it will be one of my go to meal destinations."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch and had, I think, the Thai coconut salad and it was UNBELIEVABLE. it was luck your bowl good. I'm partial to anything with a peanut sauce, and it had one, but damn it was good. Now I'm a strong believer that salads, sandwiches and cocktails and always better when they're made by someone else (honestly, they don't taste as good when you make them yourself) so that could be it too. I don't know, it's all a big peanut sauce covered mystery to me but I'll be back for another salad."}
{"text":"First time.  Tried a half Thai coconut salad and half a blueberry pesto sandwich to go. Not a great pairing decision on my part, so decided to eat them separately. The blueberry pesto sandwich is a most unlikely list of ingredients,  and it is spectacular! I wisely opted to change out of white slacks and light colored top before tackling this thing cause I had blueberry balsamic jam all over my hands. Could have been because it was so good I had to really power it down! I could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dessert.  The Thai coconut salad is stellar. Layers of flavor, variety of texture, and visually appealing. Appreciated the plating which made it easy to remove an item if you decide you don't like it. For me, that was the pickled onion, just a personal preference.  The salad benefited from going into the fridge for cooling once I got it home, but hey, it's Arizona in the summer. I'm looking forward to exploring this menu!"}
{"text":"My go-to is the smoky chicken bowl. Very light, but with enough flavor and protein to hold you over. I also recommend the curry sweet potato soup."}
{"text":"Another goofy concept to bring indecisive healthy (maybe) eaters together and offer them any type of food they want while executing horribly.   I've read the critics reviews and yes this place needs a lot of refinement.   Let's start with the entrance..where is it?  There are two and if you take the one nearest the Mercedes dealership you are brought directly to the food pickup and expediting area and need to take a sharp right to fight those that are coming downstream after ordering and wrap around tables  to get in line. If you take the other door and it's busy you may be in line out the door.   Wasn't that busy when I ate but here is the next set of issues...  the entrance and ordering linehas a wall on one side and a sort of wooden frame wall you go between to the register. There are no menus to peruse as you follow the path and all you can see are those in front of you, bits of big screens containing the menu and three large indistrialesque ikea style dome lights that block the top half of the menus.  So you'll want to read the long...very long menu before you get to the register but can't. You'll find yourself craning your neck forward and trying not to creepily bump into or smell the person in front of you while doing it.  You'll see that the only time you can see the entire menu is when you are really next in line or up to order. By that time you still need to take in the salads, sandwiches, pizza, soup, plate and other options while people breathe down your neck the same as you just did. Simple solution, put some menus on the wall of the line and change the light domes blocking the view.  But since they haven't you'll be pressured with \"next please\" before you've even seen the entire menu.   There are tons of options once you order.  Drinks below you, fountains drinks, cookies above the drinks, etc.  there is no tipping on the check but a separate tipping machine and CC transaction if you wish to give one.  Then you are given a buzzer and ushered off to your left to go around the salad making station. Where you wait in the hallway I mentioned earlier (other entrance) to get buzzed if you aren't at a table waiting.    While you wait, go next to the bathrooms for your drink. Ok it's a few feet away but now you know where the bathrooms are. The drink station is filled with non-Pepsi/coke options, two teas and coffee.    Now onto the food.  I ordered a Merida chicken salad.  Looked good on the menu.  As I awaited the buzzer I watched them make the salad.  The station is set up buffet style. A worker pulls the components from bins and mixes them. With dressing (3 levels) or without and another person meticulously slices precooked protein. I say meticulously because it is measured perfectly to the ounce or maybe portion of an ounce. I watched as the preparer sliced chicken breast and placed on a scale picking up and removing and recutting until the scale said exactly what it called for..not an ounce too much that is for sure.  Avocado was added by scooping out a half and plopping it on the side of the salad plate. I'm happy to get a half avocado but how about a few slices??  Now let's throw a slice of lime on top to finish it off!  I was told to be careful with the tray as the plates slide all over. And boy do they.  So be careful.   Now to the final product...  The salad looked underwhelming but open mind was kept until I started into it.  Although I could see that it was dressed, it had no flavor. Add your siracha or ask for heavy or more dressing.  Although I believe the menu said tortilla strips don't be surprised if you get full on chips.  That's what I got. I though this was a salad and not lettuce nachos.  They are everywhere so as you try and scoop up some salad with your fork be warned. Keep the balance or a big chip may slide off and be in your lap.  And then as you eat they soak up the remaining dressing and get soggy. Not yum.    The chicken wast flavored ok but super dry and the avocado was laden with dark spots.  As a Mediterranean connoisseur I appreciate feta. This may be the cheapest feta I've ever tasted. More spongy than crumbly and tasting more like mozzarella than feta.   So to conclude, this place needs a whole overhaul already. Perhaps the pizza or sandwiches are good yet overcooked and flavorless food will never be a bright spot in anyone's desires (unless society has fallen that much). If you get past the layout and the food it has a bright spot, when the weather is great you can sit outside, listen to music and look at the Mercedes dealership hoping to forget the disappointment you just spent $15 on."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in town! The chipolte steak sandwich is great! Their Pizza is killer too.."}
{"text":"Modern market is a hit or miss. Sometimes the food tastes great and sometimes it tastes like its been sitting out for hours."}
{"text":"Great options, healthy choices, steak, chicken, pizza and salad, quick friendly service.  The wintergreen salad was amazing! Good kid options and adults get to have beer and wine!"}
{"text":"Food was good but overpriced. My grandson liked the Mac and cheese. Staff was friendly but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"It's great to have a healthy and delicious restaurant so close. I almost always order the chicken breast homestyle plate with veggies on the side and extra chimichuri sauce. The sauce is my favorite part, I want the recipe. My vegetarian mom likes the tofu plate and my friend's favorite is the wintergreen salad."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but sometimes a bit on the bland side. However I love knowing that the food I eat is healthy and sustainable. This place hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty food and friendly service. I love the options available to create a meal of your choosing (salad, pizza, sandwich, etc\". I tried the truffle potato pizza last time I was in and OH MY YUM it was so good!! It's a seasonal item though, so try it while it is available!   Every time I've come in, the service has been outstanding. I appreciate interacting with people who genuinely seem to be enjoying their job. I also downloaded the app which you can earn rewards for future visits. Just for downloading it, they give you $3 for free!   There is a lot of patio seating to enjoy the nice weather too! Definitely worth a visit if you haven't tried yet! Another thing I love (if you keep track of your eating like I do), your receipt includes the nutrition breakdown of the exact meal you ordered! I LOVE THIS. Not everyone will appreciate it as much as me, but for those of you who will...YAY!"}
{"text":"I gotta say I'm pretty impressed with this place. I had never tried it until this new location opened and the food is pretty exceptional. I work across the street and they were very generous prior to opening, coming by to drop off amazing cucumber lemonades and giving us food. So far I've had the bacon corn pizza, flat iron steak salad, and basil chicken sandwich and they've all been spectacular. A+"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but it took 20 minutes to get scrambled eggs when it wasn't super busy yet. Understandable as we went on opening day, but overall, very enjoyable! Plenty of staff came to check on us throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Takes \"fast casual\" to a new low. Food is bland, carelessly prepared. Not returning."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! The food is very fresh and is made to order, which I like. I do, however think the taste of the food is somewhat bland and underwhelming.  We went here on mother's day and the service was decent and the employees were courteous and friendly. I know I wouldn't be if I had to work on a Sunday...haha. The restaurant was clean and very modern looking (I guess it would have to be since modern is in their name. haha).   My mom ordered a gluten free vegan pizza which was pretty good. Gluten free pizza crust has a tendency to taste like a piece of hot cardboard...but Modern Market seems to have done a good job with this.   I ordered some sort of tofu platter that had sesame tofu, mixed vegetables, and some sweet potato mash. I didn't care for the tofu or the mixed vegetables, which had a weird taste. The tofu was covered in sesame seeds, which gave it a bitter taste. Once you dipped it in the sauce though, it was palatable.   I'll definitely give this place another try...maybe I ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Went back a second time and we each got the ranch steak. We both thought it was well seasoned and very good quality. She got a little more fat on her pieces than I did, but not a big deal. We both requested it well done and it was perfect. Again, the food and ambience were great. Excellent music. Only complaint this time around is that most of the tables around us were dirty and not wiped off the whole 30-40 minutes we were there."}
{"text":"We tried the new modern market eatery through an app called Eventbrite they offered free meals to try out the restaurant. We both ordered steak and the meat was amazing,  quality and cooked  to perfection, deliciously seasoned with a delightful choice of sides. We will be back! Prices appear reasonable for the quality of food. Brand-new so it was super clean and very friendly service. Family friendly menu."}
{"text":"Rarely ever leave reviews but had to this time. Got the salmon Caesar salad and pizza. Both were out of this world. Wow. Pizza is light but packed with delicious flavor and the salmon salad was so refreshing and filling. My husband got the chicken with a size of mashed potatoes and arugula salad. He loved it. Ate every bite. If you are a bit on the more health conscious side this is definitely the place to come to. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what Ahwatukee needed... healthy food that's tastes good at a reasonable price. We frequent this place and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Glad to have Modern Market Eatery in the neighborhood because having options is always a good thing. I love how fresh their ingredients are. Food comes out fast and staff were eager to help. They also gave samples of the soup which was nice.  The salmon bowl was delicious. The salmon was moist and the curry sauce paired nicely with the salmon, rice and the vegetable. Just loved everything about this this including low calorie count at 440. However, it is on the small side so if your hungry teenager is eating this dish, prepare to order a second one.   The BLT was absolutely delicious. Loved the nicely toasted bread. However, the bread was on the greasy side...probably the reason for the higher 1000 calories. Flavor & seasoning was spot on!   Overall, very good food, fresh ingredients and welcoming atmosphere. Will be returning to try their combo plates."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. I was curious to try this new place and I don't regret it. I had the eggs and prosciutto breakfast plate that comes with toast, lightly dressed salad and tomatoes. It was the perfect filling meal yet, light. All the ingredients are fresh and you can taste it. Moderately priced too. One meal and one beverage for less than $10. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Interested alternative to lgoNo! & Sam Fox. Has pkg!! A little pricey but what isn't in snotsdale..."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we had a coupon and wanted to try something new. I ended up ordering the BLT and couldn't have been more disappointed. For the money, it was not worth it at all. Also, I asked to have mayonnaise in the sandwich and was told they didn't have mayo. Then, I asked for some mustard on the side and was told they didn't have mustard either. Who doesn't have mayo, or mustard?! The girl that waited on me was really nice, apologetic and helpful with our order. I'll probably come back and try one of their pizzas, but won't bother ordering a sandwich again. Also, sandwiches only come with that and no sides. Eh, give it a shot if you like playing craps...you might luck out."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick lunch spot and this popped up in yelp. This location is busy as there are some other healthy options in the area,  but parking is available. Although it looked busy from the outside, there was not a line when I arrived at 2:00pm.  Service was friendly. I was curious about the egg plant goat cheese sandwich and the cashier assured me it was very good. She was right! What a flavorful fresh sandwich! I got mine to go and it was ready in under 5 minutes.  So many other  appetizing options on the menu so I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was!  I ordered the half eggplant and goat cheese sandwich, along with a cup of broccoli and cheddar soup.  The soup was delicious and tasted much more fresh than any I have had in a while. The sandwich was a perfect size and the flavors were delicious.  I can't wait until the one at the Promenade opens because I will be there often!! Highly recommended for a quick and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Not fresh. Asked for eggs well done. Not at all.  Potatoes cold.  Broccoli in omelet spoiled. Told manager. He grunted and dumped in garbage. I should have done that before I ate and paid"}
{"text":"We rode bikes here from our hotel Wednesday morning for breakfast. Food was quick, healthy, and delicious. There was a ton of seating available both inside and outside. I had the bacon and eggs. My husband had the same and loved the bread that came along with it. HUGE portion of food."}
{"text":"New restaurant that you order at the counter and they give you a pager and when your food is ready the pager goes on and you pick it up at the counter.  Very modern chic with a good seating area and a bar table that is against a roll up garage type of open air area with a screen to give you a little protection from the elements yet give you the outdoors feel. It also has plug ins for electrical or usb plugs to charge most items.  We tried the Homestyle Plate, The Sustainable Salmon Plate and One of the Toasted Sandwich, the Steak Sandwich. They also have some interesting Pizzas which we did not have.  The Steak Sandwich comes on a Chibatta Roll and has horseradish which gives it a little kick but not over bearing. A decent amount of steak but when biting into the meat it was very difficult to bite into without having to tear it apart since the meat was stringy.  The Salmon Plate was pretty tasty with a good chunk of salmon and greens along with bread crutons. However the bread crutons were hard and tough. I know regular crutons are generally hard and crunchy, but this is like bread that has been sitting out for a while hard.  Nice addition to the area, food was good, just a little off the mark but and a nice place for lunch time or casual dinner."}
{"text":"Really glad we decided to check out this newly opened restaurant! We got the Eggplant Goat sandwich (great vegetarian option) and the Lemongrass Pork bowl. Both were delicious -- great mix of flavors and textures, good portion sizes at very reasonable prices. Definitely try the different lemonades, too! The carrot lemonade was my favorite. Service was friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch for the first time. Order at the counter and get a buzzer to get your food at the counter. Both of us had the sustainable salmon plate. It was delicious, although the portion size was a little on the small side for $13.20. The side salads were delicious that I got and the pizza looked wonderful going by. The only complaint is the soft drinks. The diet soda is probably the worst I have ever tasted. Blech. Nonetheless. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Modern Market has a great assortment of delicious choices, but my visit today was made fantastic by Kedi who spent extra time walking us through substitution choices for the menu and assuring our visit was amazing! She is an absolute asset to this location! Incredible service! People like Kedi are the reason people will come back again and again! Thank you for ensuring our lunch was stellar!"}
{"text":"We stopped here because we wanted fresh clean food to eat for lunch. Walking in, it felt nice & inviting. The cashier was very patient with us because we had never been here & there were so many options, we were undecided.  They offer lots of salads, bowls, wraps, burgers, alcoholic beverages, teas and fountain drinks. I ordered their chicken bowl & my fiance got their steak salad. He also ordered a regular fountain drink & I just had a water & milk because I needed more calcium for the day! :)  They have such a variety of teas & fresh juices such as cucumber lemon water, carrot lemon juice and much more! They were super delicious!!  Our food came out within 15mins and the portions were a good size, I thought they could have added a little more flavor to the meals but then again this was a clean eat restaurant lol  They have clean bathrooms & also a section where they have hot sauce bottles, salt/pepper bottles, fresh lemons & limes, napkins & to go plates for customers to pack themselves. I thought this was really cool because you don't have to wait on staff for those items! Overall great experience that was FRESH!"}
