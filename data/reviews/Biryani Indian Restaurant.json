{"text":"Just came back from Friday lunch buffet. Chef Billu made a new dish today - Chicken Chettinad. This is a spicy chicken recipe from southern India, and chef Billu once again did an AMAZING job! I can barely move right now because I had 4 full helpings of this Chicken Chettinad ... it was so good, made from scratch with fresh roasted spices and garnishing. 
I like everything he cooks, expecially the Kababs, Tandoori Chicken, Palak Paneer, Goat Curry, Chicken Vindaloo and the fried Catfish. Oh, and the fresh naan's just melt in your mouth.
Have to take a nap now!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Pittsburgh ! No where else has compared. After trying other Indian places around Pittsburgh , this will be our go to from now on."}
{"text":"Way too over priced . No good temperature control. Servers don't k know much about the menu. Quality of food is good. Wait time too long specially on weekend. This guy is charging  for how much a high end fine restaurants would charge. Nothing fancy about the place"}
{"text":"Great price,  good but limited food on buffet. 
If they say their open till 2.30p.m. they should not run out of any food choices @ 1.50p.m. For  $7 dollars though it was good. No sag paneer on buffet. No dessert @ all. Would like to try on a Sunday early like 11.30 or 12.   All in all I would rate  3 or 3.5 star"}
{"text":"A+  Wow, I was unprepared for the unbelievable food I just had!  The samosas were perfect and my curry was on point.  Traveling from out of town. I was faced with hundreds of decisions of where to eat (mostly chain places). Glad I chose a family run authentic Indian restaurant. Will add this place to my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Located within a shopping mall, Biryani is easy to find and parking is plenty. It's entrance could use a facelift, but as you enter the restaurant you'll notice that decor is not its priority nor is it their focus.

I had visited this location once before, several months ago, but I can't remember how I liked the food. The manager that day was very accommodating to my vegetarian requests and I remember that mainly, enough of a reason to visit this restaurant again. 

As soon as I walked in, I was seated and my order was promptly taken. There's playful Punjabi music playing in the background, making the wait for my veg. thali (with ghobi substituted for chana) more relaxing.

I've written all of this while waiting for my food, so the rest of this review's tone will be entirely targeted at the quality of the food and its taste. My credentials are that I was born in India and eat Indian food regularly.

...15minutes later, my thali arrives with a basket of naan, everything just as I ordered. Considering the taste of the food is fresh, I consider 15 mins totally worth it. I came at a non-busy hour however, lucky for me.

I set the spice level of the food to 7, and it was perfect for me. If my girlfriend came with me, I would definitely go for an 8 and order some raita. The food was wonderful. It had that home-cooked element to it, and although it used oils, it wasn't soaked in it. I'd recommend the aloo ghobi and the khadai paneer any day. The palak paneer was also made well, but I am not a huge fan of the creaminess, just a matter of preference. My personal notes: next time skip the palak and ask for the ghobi to be cooked with light oil.

Food was so good, I ordered some vegetable biryani to go,  which arrived rather quickly. I wouldn't say this is the fanciest spot ever, but they have great service and provide great tasting Indian food, and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The food as ok.  I went because I have a gift certificate from Resturaunt.com.  I got the Lamb Biryani.  It was hard to eat because there were bits of hard bones in it. It was suppose to be boneless.  For the price of 13.75, I only got little bits of lamb which was more fat than meet.  I'm gonna try the buffet next to see if it's better."}
{"text":"Service was terrible -- the server was friendly, but clueless.  Every question about the food caused her to scamper back to the kitchen window to ask the cook.  We were missing an entree when the food was delivered, and she seemed baffled on how to remedy that situation.  No offer of dessert.  We had coupons for second entree half-off - she took the coupons, but the discount did not appear on the checks until we asked her to re-run them.

Food was -- just ok.  Papdi chat did not have enough sauce -- ie yogurt and the tamarind and cilantro chutneys.  The chutneys were present... but just a little of each.  Two dishes were ordered HOT (the waitress asked for a number, we said 10) - one was completely mild, the other medium spicy.  The dish ordered MILD was also medium spicy.  Black bean dal was pretty flavorless.  

Zero ambiance.

Menu is very limited.  (As I write that sentence, I'm wondering if this should have been one star rather than two.)

I enjoy Indian food, and I'm happy to try new places - but we won't be going back to Biryani."}
{"text":"This is a great place, some of the best Indian food outside India I've ever had. Nothing mass prepared about any of the dishes, each seems uniquely prepared, none of that one sauce fits all. Haven't tried the weekend buffets, but they sound great, and the usual weekday one was excellent. One of the features we liked best was the made-on-site achar, very fresh, not overly spicey, crisp, refreshing. The garlic naan are to die for, and the lamb kebabs were spectacular. I don't think there is anything better in Pittsburgh. Don't do take out, eat in, get the best of it while it's hot."}
{"text":"We did a phone order for door delivery today looking at the reviews here and this was the place close by the hotel we stayed.

I am sorry to say that the food was very bad. The dum chicken biryani we ordered was cold and tasted pathetic. The Tandoori chicken had nothing expect salt and jeera powder. The chicken was better compared to the other too. The food was pricey too. Having eaten at various Indian restaurants in USA in the last 10 years, I experienced the worst Indian food tonight. May be my tongue buds are tamed too much for traditional Indian flavors.

I would definitely not recommend to anyone who is expecting a traditional tasting food."}
{"text":"Awful. I ordered takeout, and when I showed up a half hour later as they said to, they hadn't even processed the order. The person I talked to was unapologetic and acted like it shouldn't be a big deal for me to put in my order again and wait another half hour. This was my first experience here, and I'll never return."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Really enjoyed dinner one night, came back later that week for their lunch buffet - both delicious.  Chef uses top quality ingredients and takes care to make it fresh.

Highly recommend. Best Indian food in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Success! Service is friendly and attentive. Good is wonderfully flavorful and spicy.
The chicken Tikka and the spinach and onion pakora were my faves."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.   The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the food was fantastic.   Hat's off to chef Billu!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and am glad there are so many choices in the Monroeville area.  

We really enjoyed our experience here and the food was some of the best Indian we've had.  The service was the only thing that is keeping this from a 5 star review.  It took a bit before the hostess/server acknowledged we were there.  And the servers seemed somewhat unprofessional.  Inbetween working on tables, they were texting or playing games in full view of everyone in the restaurant.

The menu is much smaller than it is at most other Indian restauratns.  But what they do have is a good mix of entree choices.  Food is cooked to order and they are OK with special requests and substitutions.  Everything we tried was full of flavor and cooked very well.

Check for coupons before your visit as there are often discounts available.  Also, sign up for their text club because you get a free appetizer with an entree purchase.

Overall, a great restaurant and a place we'll visit again."}
{"text":"Rasmalai is the best and they provide fresh and one of the best naan in pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant!! We went for lunch and had the chicken tiki masala and curry lamb. Both were very good."}
{"text":"The one reviewer's right, nothing fancy. But it's a solid restaurant.

The food was very good, and different than what I'm used to. I had a chicken dish that was cooked with the bones in. Yumm.. Great rice and sauces to go with it.

The Naan was...OK. It's the only Naan I've ever had so I've nothing against which to compare it."}
{"text":"Most disgusting biryani I have ever ate in my life, first of all it's not biryani, they mixed some pre cooked rice with pre cooked lamb curry and added some spices over it, what's funny is the name of the place is biryani... ! Either they should change the name of the restaurant and remove biryani from menu and name that as yellow rice and lamb curry. I spent $17 for that yellow rice. I'm not coming here for sure, also tell all my friends never to go there. I wish yelp has negative stars I would have given negative 10. I bet you can cook better than what they are serving here. So watch out guys"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet. Good selection, spicing just right. Includes dessert and naan. It's not fancy on the outside but the food is very good and service first-rate."}
{"text":"I went here for the Sunday lunch buffet that is advertised on their website.  I get there literally hours before the buffet is supposed to end only to find the restaurant closed!  Drove over 40 minutes to get there only to find the place closed, very disappointing.  Apparently the Grand Deluxe weekend buffet is no longer a thin, it'd be nice if they would update their website.  I've been there before and the food is really good, but this last visit was just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Flavor that will make you cry, service dreamed of only in the 1930s luxury establishments. If you have the choice of eating anywhere in the world, choose Biryani.  Brilliant menu, not expensive at all, just not enough good words to praise these people."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Biryani for the express lunch buffet and dinner. 

I think the lunch buffet is a good value for the price. The options are very limited, but it's only $7.00. They offered chicken tikka masala and tandoor chicken. They also had two other bean dishes and then yogurt, tamarind and mint chutney and of course naan. The tikka masala was just ok it wasn't very flavorful. On the other hand the chicken tandoori was completely mind blowing! It was the best chicken tandoori I've ever had. 

For dinner we ordered the tandoori chicken and chicken curry. Once again I was blown away with the tandoori chicken, but completely let down with the chicken curry. It tasted too tomato-ee and too plain. There naan is also so-so. 

I would recommend this place for the tandoori chicken but not really for the sauces or curries."}
{"text":"My wife's favorite kind of food is Indian food. So we frequent many a nan - curry - saag purveying establishment. Biryani stands out among them. It is the same tasty Indian food but all of the flavors are more intense and it's got a wide selection. It is more fresh, spicy, creamy, and sweet than the normal fair. Also the meat is cooked to perfection, the chicken korma will melt in your mouth and the tandoori falls off the bone. There are also fish dishes, which not all Indian restaurants have.  Don't miss the lunch buffet 11:30AM-3PM Lunch Buffet Friday-Sunday or the incredibly down to earth friendly staff.  They already have the food and service, my only knock against this place is the interior is pretty shabby, with more focus on ambiance and atmosphere Biryani would offer the perfect Indian dining experience."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise actually....decent menu, lunch special buy one, 2nd is half price....small portions but lunch appropriate. very flavorful...only set back to me, we like buffets when we indulge in Indian. they do have a buffet but only for the weekend...lunch time here on Thursday is mighty slow. Naan was very good as well, fresh and crispy, naanwich was just ok, I added some of the sauce from the chicken tikka masala into the wrap to give it a little umph....then it was delicious! Server was awesome, honestly amazing and friendly, entertained my little one, very refreshing!!!!"}
