{"text":"During the summer, we enjoyed the outdoor patio especially on Sunday afternoons. Recently, we had a lovely New Year's Eve dinner at this charming and quaint gem of a place. Four course dinner was delicious, wine was perfect, guitarist was delightful and staff was welcoming and professional....amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food and wine. Such a charming atmosphere, great for small gatherings or just a hot date!!"}
{"text":"Adorable little place. The atmosphere and the food are equally fantastic. 

The fact that the chef can put out such good food on his own in such a SMALL kitchen is amazing. He doesn't have any open flame and literally zero workspace. The food came out with good timing too, yet another difficult task with a one man show. 

We tried pizza, salads, soup and fish. Everything was delicious. The wine selection is small but all good choices. Lemon drop martini was so good, strong and not too sweet. 

I cannot say enough and cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"let me start by saying that this place, despite its idiosyncracies, is great. but i left feeling like it was on the cheap. glassware and chairs/tables are very thrifty, and for the prices, i expected a bit more. 
the service is warm, laidback and fun. never felt rushed (how could you when the food takes so long?) and was always attended to. the food is inspired, if a bit slow. my wife and i started with the grilled avocado, with an excellent prosciutto spread. we split a spinach salad (excellent), and followed that with truffle sacheti and halibut. the fish was wonderful, could have used more sauce in my opinion, but our server proclaimed it as the most popular dish at the restaurant, so i went along. the sacheti was tasty, but i wondered if it would be as good without the truffle oil.

all in all, a good experience, i will tell my friends. a word of warning, getting an actual reservation is next to impossible if the owner isn't there. very rude reservation policy. surely the staff can take down a name, yes?

will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Pan a cotta was like stiff jello - not creamy as expected.  Watch out for a $2 split per item - this is not necessary considering the price on each dish."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre over all. Appetizer was good. Carbonara was not very good. When I ordered my pasta I asked what sauce was on it. I was told it was tossed with olive oil, when it arrives it has tomato sauce. I was awful, sent it back. I had a salad instead with chicken. For the price the salad was very small and the dressing was bad. The chicken looked like it was boiled it had no sear. Found out the are using Cannons oil instead of olive oil which has a much better flavor. Everything was under seasoned. The drink prices were outrageous. Will not be back and don't recommend."}
{"text":"5 stars without hesitation. A small and quaint environment with a cozy warmth! The food was as good as you can get in any Italian Restaurant in the United States, and I am very well traveled. Visited this past Friday for the first time and was wowed by the crab pasta alfredo. My companion had the bruschetta and the Mahi fish dinner topped with fruit salsa. Upon sampling his dish, I wish they offered smaller \"tapas\" style plates so I would have been inclined to order both dishes. Remarkable presentation and flavor profile! Friendly service as well, informative and well versed dialogue. I only wish the restaurant was larger! Maybe they will expand operations someday! Well done!"}
{"text":"My wife, my Greyhound- Dragon- and I have dined on the patio the last several Sundays and have been very satisfied with the food and service.  They have a full bar and decent wine and beer selections.  Good food and attentive service in a beautiful setting is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Amazing wine and scrumptious food! The little patio is so quaint and the atmosphere is elegant and cozy. The price is a little high but completely understandable for the quality."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best place ever.

I was surprised to find this little Italian cafe and wine bar within the Huntingon Reservation in Bay Village. The only reason I found out about it was because a friend suggested it for her birthday. We had the best experience.

On a Friday night, it wasn't crowded, but we were still glad we had a reservation. We sat outside, and our apprehensions about being chilly were quickly assuaged by the fleece blankets that had been place on our chairs, as well as heating lamps near the tables. 

The service was very good. Not too in-your-face, but didn't disappear for an hour either. 

We had the cheese plate (amazing), followed by a few entrees that we split among 4 of us. I would highly recommend doing this, as each entree is extremely special and should be experienced by all members of your party. We tried three different pastas and a pizza. All excellent.

Our server brought us a piece of the flourless chocolate cake with a candle in it for my friend's birthday. Understated and perfect, as we'd said we didn't want a big to-do. Very classy all around.

And the bill? Totally affordable. We all spent around 50 bucks, and that was including two bottles of wine, an appetizer, an entree apiece, and dessert. Way better than I had ever imagined.

Plus it is so quaint at Vento. We saw a deer just hanging out, and views of the sunset and lake. What could be better?"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive... this very small restaurant is charming and romantic. The main entrees chicken Marsala and Chicken Parmesan were tasty. Here is the less positive, the bread basket contained two quarter sized crostini sized bread rounds and two crouton like bread squares.... it was tasty but skimpy. The chairs were very uncomfortable and our table was wobbly, just needs a simple shim. In general  the place looked like it could use a scrubbing.  Dirty windows and dusty shelves. Service was nice but just not enough food for the price."}
{"text":"I am confused by the 4 star rating. The place seemed dirty, only 1 server working lunch (although she did hustle) and the food portions were small and overpriced. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We love this place!
Small. Quaint. Great outdoor patio. Salmon is fantastic! 
The owner is a doll!  Betsy, our server, is a hoot! 
If you are there during business hours there is a cute shop next door to browse for cute beach themed items, jewelry and more. 
It's located across from Huntington Beach, and right next door you can take in the Bay Arts exhibits!"}
{"text":"We have not been back here since the disaster that was my mom's birthday dinner last year, May 24, 2011.  We had a reservation for a weeknight, and when we were seated things seemed normal.  Not sure how long it took us to order drinks, but they took quite a while to come.  And then another long period before we could order.  Sadly, we made the mistake of ordering appetizers before main meals, and that was terrible.  Having ordered some wine, I kept sipping it but there was nothing to soak it up.  After perhaps an hour since being seated, we were given a small bowl of bread well after some other tables.  

All in all, we were in the restaurant over 1.5 hours before deciding to leave.  At that time we had got our wine and water and a bowl of bread.  Ridiculous.  Since the appetizers were \"almost done\" we waited another 10 or so minutes to carry them out.

My brother, who had worked at an Indian restaurant in college, found out that the manager was away and there was basically the one server and the chef.  And someone who was doing prep work and serving.  Yeah.  That doesn't work.

Thing is, this place has great food.  We had been there in the past and while it is often slow, the food is delicious.  They also have jazz on Thursday nights now.

However, because my mom's birthday dinner was ruined, I don't feel much like patronizing this place again.  We weren't given any consideration for our celebration or apology, and we had to pay for the appetizers, though I think the drinks were taken off.  We were lucky they didn't charge us for the dinner too, which we never got."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an absolutely beautiful setting right across from Huntington beach. Both the patio and the interior are warm, romantic, intimate, and a stunning place to spend an evening.

The stand out on the menu to me are the pizza/flatbread options. The crust is crispy and thin and holds the toppings well - which are well-chosen and provide a vibrant balance of flavors. The appetizers are also flavorful and good for sharing with small groups. I've been mildly disappointed with the pasta entrees - a touch of salt for final seasoning would go a long way.

Their wine list is mostly Italian, and seems carefully curated. My only recommendations here would be to ensure that the red wine is served slightly chilled and not at room temperature, and to include some lower-priced bottles on the list. We've  sometimes chosen to dine elsewhere because the bottles are a bit pricey here, and we normally go through two of them.

The also owner takes her time to visit tables and ensure the experience was excellent. She obviously takes pride in her wonderful restaurant, and she should, it's lovely!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars because these people gave my wife and I a wonderful early evening last Friday. We had business to attend to in the area so I checked out the local dining scene on Yelp and Vento came out on top. The weather was dismal and definitely not optimal for the outdoor ambiance the restaurant seemed to be noted for. The plan was to take a peek inside and see if it merited a destination journey (from Medina) on some summer evening and then venture elsewhere for dinner. Upon arriving we found an empty parking lot, lots of very cute neighboring businesses and galleries that were closed due to the weather and we wondered if Vento was indeed open.
We braved the weather to find that fortunately it was open.
We love romantic places and after stepping inside ahead of me I knew my wife was \"hit\" as her eyes darted around and she began to grin. The romantic lighting, the décor that is more French than Italian, the music playing that are the owner's private selections, the intimate table for two by the window that we picked all made for an atmosphere of what we value most in a restaurant....once inside, your worries and cares of the day are left far behind. 
This is a very special little place.
My wife suggested we stay and share a couple of glasses of wine. We were greeted by Heather who was working behind the bar and seemingly the only one there. Turns out, Heather is the manager and was off to an early start. She couldn't possibly have been more personable or more attentive. 
My spouse had a glass of Zin from Lodi that was well above par. A pleasant surprise for the price point. Me, Mr. Sweet Tooth had a Chocolate Martini from their impressive list of concoctions. It was so good. Death by overdose of these things wouldn't be a bad way to go.
Checking out the menu, my wife asked if we should eat there; a foregone conclusion in her mind by that point. 
We each had fresh Vento salads. I emphasize the word \"fresh\". Not overdone, it was the right portion and a good beginning.
We have learned to order core menu items when we first visit a restaurant that we may consider returning to, so we ordered the Pasta & Meatballs and the Chicken Braciole. Both were finely prepared. The meatballs were mostly if not all veal plated with melted cheese on top. Attractive and heavenly tasting. It was a dish that many restaurants prepare in a heavy sauce. This was fresh and lighter than most. What would have made this dish absolute perfection would be to use thin spaghetti rather than standard. Otherwise it was perfect as served. The Chicken Braciole was prepared properly as well. Many places that offer a Braciole fall victim to the inherent dryness that is common with this type of dish. Not so this one. Moist  and flavorful, Vento's version is served stuffed with prosciutto, parmesan & fontal cheeses, lemon, arugula and raisins served atop a risotto that would challenge the best Italian restaurant anywhere to match its flavor and texture. We finished with coffee a very nice tiramisu.  
During our visit, we met Diana, (or it could be Diane, I misplaced her card so please forgive me dear lady) who made us even more welcome. We shared a few stories and found her to be, like Heather as special as this place called Vento La Trattoria.
Upon leaving, the restaurant began filling with regulars and we realized just how good our fortune was with this pick and the timing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The wine list will not disappoint and I recommend the sexton Zinfandel. At $10/glass it's a bargain of a full bodied wine with an everlasting finish... Then came the crab cake (singular, yes) but very worth the flaky delicate real lump crab you get to enjoy. For dinner, the truffle sacchetti pasta will blow you away. I have to say, it is one of the best 10 meals I've ever had. The sacchetti are handmade pillows of flaky cheesy goodness served up in a truffle sauce that swims with sautéed mushrooms, tiny potatoes, and sun dried tomatoes. If I'm waxing eloquent it's because the decadence of this meal can stand for nothing less. To tone it down a bit, my fiancé had the margarita pizza and, as this is definitely not a pizza place, it didn't blow our minds. However, I certainly wouldn't rate this place based on their pizza. Rate it on their wine, their crab cakes, their delicate pillowy pastas--that's what I did. Five stars baby. Oh, and the service was great, too. We sent our compliments to the chef and he came out to thank us. That's how you win repeat customers."}
{"text":"Disappointing dining experience.  Attempted several times to call for reservation, without means to leave message or speak to staff.  Arrived at 
5 pm, without reservation, and told space could be made outdoors in a few minutes or immediate seating inside. Once directed into an empty dining room, we were seated at a table with a portable a/c floor unit directly behind the chair. We moved ourselves to another empty table. The manager/owner came to our table to inform us we were seated at a table reserved for 7:30, it was currently 5:30. We would need to be done by that time. We let her know we would be long gone prior to that reservation. She told us they prepared a table for us outdoors, but had moved ourselves indoors, we corrected her and said a server led us to the empty indoor space. Lunch menus were on the tables instead of dinner.  Took photos of the empty dining space at 5:30 and again when we left at 6:30, one additional table filled. Server was fine and food adequate.  Rude behavior of owner will keep me away from this restaurant.  Best luck to you if you need wheelchair access, not easily accessible into indoor dining space unless you like a kitchen tour."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Huntington Beach, but only recently discovered this little gem of a restaurant. Wonderful atmosphere, cocktails and Italian comfort food in a converted train depot. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new quaint spot for a nice dinner & we found a new favorite! We sat at the bar (chairs were alittle small, but that would be our only complaint), ordered a mushroom and truffle pizza as an appetizer (delicious and filling), eggplant parmesan (large & great sauce), and truffle pasta with mushroom and sun dried tomatoes (the beat dish ever - we will be back for this many more times to come)! Topped off with great service, short bread & fruit for dessert...it was a wonderful night inside this cute cozy house! A must see!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner nestled in the Huntington Reservation not far from the beach and lake. We enjoyed our early fall lunch on the patio, the indoor seating area is very nice but we could not waste a sunny fall day. We started off with some wine, Chardonnay from my wife and a Pinot Noir for myself. Decent wine list with some nice by the glass options.

I started with the soup, a potato leek soup with pancetta, that hit the spot. Pasta was the call for both of us, Truffle Sacchatti for my wife while I went with the Pasta Alla Boscaiola. It was a toss up on trying to guess who had the better lunch, both plates were seasoned and prepared with a nice bit of finesse. We passed on desert but were tempted."}
{"text":"First time here and everyone was very nice... We were seated outside which was very pleasant... Next to the nice tree's and the blanket was a nice touch in case it got cold. 

The food was very tasty and the price was steep for me. I only say that because I finished my chicken piccata and I was still hungry. I did not take a photo of that dish because it had a presentation where it was kind of thrown on the plate. Two pieces of chicken and a couple of green beans.

 I am glad I tried this place out because all of my friends rave about it!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful! Our server was probably the sweeter person I've ever encountered. I had the margarita pizza and a Cesar salad. The pizza wasn't bad, it just needed something else, maybe just ranch to dip or something. The salad was great. The only thing I didn't love was the menu. I just wish it had more options."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place for lunch and really loved it. Interesting wine selections and great food. Quaint inside and great views as the lake (albeit a distance away) is not blocked by  too much. We'll definitely be back when the weather is nicer and we can walk around the park before heading in for some lunch."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  The atmosphere is very charming.  I've been here twice and both times were great experiences.  Food is great, but service could have been a bit better."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this restaurant out since it opened and finally made it. A small intimate, comfortable restaurant with a very attentive staff.  A wonderful wine selection is available by glass or bottle. Our appetizer, soup and entrees were excellent."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week. Great weather and we ate outside. They have blankets folded over on chairs at each table. Makes it look like someone is saving a seat. Found out the blankets are for people to stay warm in the event of a lake breeze. 

I'm a high-maintenance meat and potato gal. In other words, I prefer high quality basics. 

The stars and the moon were twisted.  Made me order a foo-foo dish.  I got that new trendy food that I can't pronounce.   Quinoa.

Great quinoa/couscous dish. Tastes fresh with a subtle lemon flavor. It was a wonderful surprise. Lunch partner had chicken sandwich and stated it was tasty.

They put some fancy bread on the table, too.  Yummy. 

Waitress never came back to check on us or offer to replenish my $2.75 ice tea."}
{"text":"The coziest, most charming and adorable place with the best food!!! It is seriously so cute- I think I read it was an old train depot? This will definitely be my new go to seeing as how it's only a few minutes from my house. The food is amazing!!! Yummy authentic Italian food and delicious drinks. I had the italian wedding soup (scrumptious) and the truffle mushroom sachetti (also scrumptious) as an entree. The decor is so inviting and I love the intimate feel of the inside. They also have outdoor seating for Summer. I cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing day with my sisters.  The atmosphere was perfect. The service exceptional.  The drinks spectacular.  A memory I will cherish"}
{"text":"Don't read the older reviews. There's a newer chef, Fillippo, who will stun you with his talent. The dishes are all fantastic and created with such love. The food is the best in town, and the wine selection can't be beat either. There's a unique cocktail menu that is a must try. The service can't be beat either. I didn't even mention the atmosphere yet. There is no place like Vento. Make a reservation so you get a table. Its popularity is growing fast! And the place is small and quaint. Call ahead unless you want to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting, just OK food.

My wife and I went here with another couple recently. It really is a beautiful setting--a great place to while away a few hours. However, the food left something to be desired. Of the four meals at our table, only the pasta dish was excellent. The steak I ordered was overcooked (requested medium-rare) and came with some barely-edible (and under-cooked) potatoes. The two seafood dishes were meh. They market themselves as a trattoria, so I suppose we should have limited ourselves to Italian dishes.

Appetizers were fine but uninspired (if a bit stingy). The wine list was decent, but the waiter didn't know much about it and seemed to have a very limited knowledge of wine.

I'd come here again for drinks, then head somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is all about the vibe. It's cozy on a rainy day to sit inside or beautiful in the sun on the patio. It's quaint and romantic. The wine menu is great and the food is good. The wait staff is always friendly and accommodating. This is the best date restaurant in Bay Village for sure!"}
{"text":"Great little place to have a glass of wine.  We sat outside and shared a bottle of wine and the cheese plate.  The cheese plate was very good and well priced.  $12 for 4 different cheeses, nuts and fruit.  It's nice that they have blankets on the porch for when it gets cooler."}
{"text":"We visited this little place with a few friends last night.  While I knew nothing about the restaurant, our friends apparently were regulars.  Had the bruschetta and peppers to start which I could have eaten all night.  My wife ordered the salmon w/ a garlic risotto, and I ordered the linguini w/ shrimp.  I was awesome! It took us an hour to get there, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch...had a wonderful sausage panini and glass of wine.  Sandwich had great flavors and sitting on the patio was beautiful.  Can see the lake from my seat.  Attentive waitstaff even well past lunch rush.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I think with the competition with the Westlake/Bay area, Vento needs to step it up. I was pretty let down by the food here. I think this would maybe be better for lunch on a nice day, but dinner was not that good. Cute place, very professional server, but pretty pricey too. Even with my groupon it was not worth it. I would take the ride down Lake Rd. to Danny Boys over this any day."}
{"text":"Best place in bay to unwind with a drink in the patio and take in the sunset. Definitely recommend a walk along Huntington Beach afterwards."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The food is delicious and the service was outstanding. I had linguine with white clam sauce followed by coffee and homemade tiramisu. 

The restaurant is located in a complex across the street from the lake/beach. See my photo. The building was an old train depot. My waitress was outstanding - in addition to top-notch service  she told me the history of the building. It is very unique.

They offer live music on Thursday nights. I highly recommend you check them out!

When I left my waitress came outside to say thank you and goodbye. I look forward to going back there again."}
{"text":"Precious! Precious! Precious! Hubby and I went for my B-day and wish we'd found it sooner! Waiter Eli was entertaining and attentive. Will be back soon, maybe even tomorrow LOL. We had Beet & Bibb salads, cheese plate and margherita pizza. All were great. Only request for chef/owner would be to expand the menu, more options please! Thx!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to lunch with a good friend who had been there previously and  highly recommended it. I absolutely loved the location, but it was a rainy fall day and we sat inside. Our waitress was capable but appeared disinterested in whether or not we really liked/enjoyed what we ordered. I had a cup of soup with a salad, and glad I did. The salad was under/listed as a full order dish (you can add chicken or salmon for a high dollar amount). I expected a full/dinner salad, not what I received which was the size of a side salad. I was very interested in trying to poached apples which were part of the makeup, but there were only 3 tiny shriveled slivers of apples and a very sparse serving of spinach. I would not order it again. The soup was good. If not for the good company and the ambiance of the restaurant, I would have been more disappointed than I was. I think I would go back again, on a nice day in order to sit outside."}
{"text":"Great location.  Sat on the patio with our pup, enjoying the guitar music, the personable wait staff & yummy food.  Between Lake Erie & the wonderful metropark and we were surrounded by a farmers market.  Will definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a girls' night over the weekend. We had a pretty good experience. They were out of chicken for this pasta I wanted so that was a bummer. I opted for a filet mignon which my friend teased me about since I chose Italian and didn't get any pasta, haha oh well I'm a steak girl.  I ordered it medium and said if it were a little under it's fine however it came out closer to well done which was really disappointing especially since we had been waiting for awhile and our bottle was running out. I got a pasta dish which was good and flavorful. To finish the night my card was charged twice. Fantastic! No chicken for my initial choice, a burnt steak and double charged, my frustration level was kind of high at the moment but the waitress was very apologetic. Everything worked out in the end."}
{"text":"Absolutely surprised by how good this place was. The building is really cool. The food is even better. Three $$$? I had an appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, and 2 entrees for $64."}
{"text":"Tucked in the woods of the Metroparks and across from Huntington Beach is a destination straight out of a fairy tale novel. The main restaurant looks like an old school French cottage with vintage charm. Intimate and romantic, it's a great spot for date night. Jokingly though, I also thought Gaston and LeFou were going to bust through there in song and dance. It's that kind of atmosphere! The friendly service staff pointed out the train stop history and to come back when it's a little warmer to enjoy the patio. Cuisine looks like a hearty menu of Italian. Good menu, gorgeous atmosphere, wine and cocktails - be their guest!"}
{"text":"I'm torn.  On one hand this place is about as cute as cute gets, on the other, they have some issues to work out.  So 3.5?

Like its sister restaurant Tartine, this place des not take reservations.  Instead, you call ahead about 15 minutes before you are going to arrive and they set a table for you.  Slightly less annoying than other no-res restaurants.  

The problem came when we arrived.  The hostess-- sort of an aging Patti Hansen type -- tried to seat us at a rickety bar table, despite the fact that the dining room was less than 1/2 full.  When Mon Cher Chou and I balked, after all we were there for a romantic dinner, she tried to seat us a a tiny table wedged between the bar, kitchen and bathrooms.  Again, we insisted that we would rather sit in the largely unoccupied dining room, she complained to her staff that they were trying to spread patrons out and save dining room tables for possible parties of 4 that they might have later.  She finally relented after we insisted that we did not want to sit in the worst seats in the house.  We were seated in the lovely dining room.  

After that it got better.  Our waitress was very sweet and our seat was very cozy and romantic.  NB, however, Vento serves only artisanal beers.  I had the apple lambic, which paired very well with my fish.  You can BYOB, but there is a $10 corking fee per bottle.  The kitchen was very, very slow that night so the waitress brought out bread baskets \"compliments of the chef\".  Ummm, bread baskets are compliments of the chef?  K.  The bread was crusty and delish.

The food was largely good.  Mon cher chou's crab cake was the only real dissapointment because it tasted off, like frozen crab.  My mushroom crostini was very fresh and tasty with carmelized onions and portobellos.  My halibut was tender and fresh, although it was very wet and surrounded by a pool of what I think was sauce-- a sort of yellow, buttery liquid.  Very, very tasty, but odd.  It was accompanied by a nicely flavored red pepper polenta and crisp-tender asparagus.  Mon cher chou enjoyed his roast chicken.  Desserts were good- I had some chocolate cake with blood orange ganache-- subtle and rich.  Mon cher chou had a cuppycake.

So it is difficult to say what I think overall:
The pluses:
Atmosphere- Perfect, a tiny restaurant in a quaint railway station, decorated with distressed reclaimed lumber and fancy little chandeliers.  Very romantic and charming
Location-- Huntington reservation, just across the street from the beach
Wait staff-- very friendly and cool.  They could not have been sweeter.
Food:  good, simple and subtle.


The minuses:
The hostess:  pushing bad tables on the unwary
No reservations
The wait:  the food took forever
Booze:  BYOB plus a corking fee
Fruit flies:  I ordered the apple lambic, and was immediately assaulted by fruit flies.  Weird.

We'll go back foir the good food and charming atmosphere and maintain our strong stance against bad tables!"}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance. A true hidden gem in Bay Village. The blonde manager was great. The rest of the staff is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We went to Vento for my birthday on NYE. I had such a wonderful experience! The food & drinks were delicious. Definitely a great place for couples or small intimate gatherings. I even got to meet the owner and she was such a sweetheart. They even offered us complementary champagne because it was my birthday!!!!"}
{"text":"The anniversary setting near the lake you've been looking for. Private setting, superb dining experience, and excellent service. They have a great wine and cheese selection, and seasonally selected specials. One of the best in Cleveland."}
