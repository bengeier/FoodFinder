{"text":"Things sure have changed 
We went there on valentine day (yes it may not have been a great idea but we figured that they are top professionals)  and it sure was a disaster. 
We got a good seat at the back room to the left. E server was not attentive and frankly he did not care. Our water came late and he did not explain the specials well ever. We ordered Proscutto for appetizer, lobster pasta and veal scallopiine , a glass of Melbac wine, instead we got risotto with beets for appetizer and well done veal. Why? The server did not  boer to confirm our food (my date speaks perfect English but the server does not understand us). It took so kong for e risotto to arrive that we just ate it because the server delivered the food and left us for 15 minutes without coming back to ask about the food.  Our food arrived later than 2 other tables who came in at the same time, our water glass went empty for over 15 minutes without being refilled. 
The veal came well done but I overheard the waiter asking the other table whether they want it medium . Obviously the server did not bother asking us . He was simply disinterested . The veal was salty and close to bring tough, the pasta was also salty but the portion was small.   We ate everything but we were still hungry. The portion were smaller than winterlicious. 

I glanced at the other tables. Most couples's food arrived within 15 minutes so they were done within 40 minutes. 
Overall the experience was not fitting to their reputation. Service was horrible and food was substandard. I could have got the salty veal and pasta at Olive Garden or similar grade without paying 38 for,the veal and 25 for the small bowl of pasta. 
The best thing was their bread and olive 

That is sad for a place that prides itself on service and food quality. 

Lessons learned : no more going out on valentine day and will not got back for at least 6 months"}
{"text":"Red. Beet. Risotto.

Absolutely spectacular.

I had been warned about this signature dish of celebrity chef Massimo Capra: \"Not much to look at, but you'll be smitten with your first bite.\" The waiter told me that my friends would be begging for a taste, but I told him that much like Joey Tribiani on Friends, Eleni doesn't share food.

When it was served, the plate of fuschia porridge sprinkled with chopped golden beets and greens did nothing to whet my appetite, but I dug in anyway, trusting previous reviews.

Sweet and creamy with a hint of Italian cheese (I think!), the risotto truly is a masterpiece of the culinary arts. I'm not kidding.

Only one friend asked to try it; I begrudgingly obliged (it was her birthday), and when she raved about it I declared to the rest of the table that it was hands off.

Eleni. Doesn't. Share. Food.

I also had the stuffed cornish hen - interesting, but after the appetizer, I wished I had just ordered the dinner size red beet risotto. 

It was that good."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Mistura is not a place for people who are not serious about food. To fully appreciate the fine dinning offered at this exorbitantly expensive restaurant one must first be able to come to terms with the fact that with a cheaper variety of wine and dessert you could easily be talking a hundred a head, which for can really be a deal breaker for some. 

Have you got over the price tag and you're ready to eat?

Good, now lets get to food.

Firstly, it should be noted that while I won't pretend to savor the idea of spending a cool hundred on a solitary meal, I do not believe the value is overly inflated at this establishment and the noticeably professional service somewhat compensates the diner for the heavy price tag. The wine is naturally also quite expensive, but some of the cheaper vintages of Italian wine they carry offer are of superb quality for around 50 dollars.   

With so much to choose from on the full menu, I was fortunate to be dinning with people who liked to try and taste and so I was able to try a few of the succulent dishes that Mistura has to offer. 
Perhaps the most inflated and least impressive dish was our starter the very popular fired artichoke hearts. The taste was nice, but the dish was not overly flavourful and at a price tag of 20 dollars did not put a dent in my hunger or ignite my senses in any significant way.   
My main was the duck breast which came sliced under a crispy duck leg which worked wonderfully in combination with the very tender and juicy breast. 
I also tried the lamb which was cooked so incredibly tenderly and mixed with some seasonal vegetables that created an explosion of flavour which really impressed me. 
Perhaps ever smoother was the daily special, a perfectly tenderized veal breast, slow cooked to perfection and served with the perfect combination of vegetables and a nice rich reduction sauce, absolutely magnificent. 
Top off the meal with toffee and walnut cake topped with roasted pear and cinnamon ice cream and an Irish coffee and I was as content as I have ever been, well worth the money for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I went to this restaurant for a birthday party, and I wanted something really small.  So I asked for one of the appetizer salads as my main.  The waiter seemed like he thought this was totally normal.  When the bill arrived, they had charged me double the price of the salad - so $40.  This infuriated me because this was more than many of their actual main dishes cost.  And I'm sorry to say that the salad was totally blah.

I spoke with the manager a few days later, he asked me to fax my bill, etc. So I did. He said next time I come in, dessert will be on the house.  Lame.

Lame service, lame food."}
{"text":"i had  heard a lot about Mistura  but never went.  Well, it's excellent.  The restaurant is nice looking inside.  It was crowded on  the night i was there.  This may be because it was Winterlicious in Toronto. It was a little loud but didn't affect our discussion  or mood.

The food was excellent.  I had the  goat cheese to start and then the veal loin cutlets followed the brownie dessert.  The veal was perfectly done.  The goat cheese was excellent.  The food was very very good.

The service was great.  I wished i had gotten the  wait staff's name.  She was extremely professional and  friendly.

I had a great time at Mistura.  The company was great, the food was excellent.  

Parking is available through the valet service for $10."}

July 5 2013 marks a great day in Toronto. The beginning of Summerlicious! 

My friend recently told me what a wonderful experience she had at Mistura a few weeks ago, and was eager to go back. It was a no brainer for me, as I'd watched Chef Massimo Capra on television for several years, and was always curious to try his food.

Low and behold, within minutes of being seated I saw Chef buzzing around the room greeting his guests, before he whisked himself back into the kitchen. Is it just me or is it really nice to know that a TV Chef makes the time to cook in his own restaurant? Love his commitment!

Here's what we ate:

1. Summer chopped salad with marinated vegetables, oregano dressing and shaved Parmigiano

This was by no means revolutionary, but it was tasty. The vinaigrette was acidic (which I typically like), and there was a nice combination of greens and vegetables. Compared to many of the other apps I spotted tonight, this one was a little more substantial in portion.

2. Layered marinated watermelon with Ontario feta cheese, watercress & aged balsamic dressing

While beautiful in presentation, this dish wasn't as flavourful as I had expected it to be. It could be that the watermelon wasn't ripe, or that there was a lack of contrast between the sweet melon and salty feta. 

3. Pan seared orata fillet served with crispy panella and pesto salad with tomato salsa

Can we talk Panella people? For some reason while I was looking at the menu before tonight I kept thinking \"Panzanella\". I am glad that I was mistaken, because this was the bomb! A Sicilian Fry Bread made from Chickpea Flour. Just delicious, and a great accompaniment to the delicate fish.

4. Slow roasted Ontario leg of lamb with caramelized onions, potato salad & local summer vegetables medley

My friend and I are big fans of lamb and were both excited when this dish came out. The lamb was on the gamier side, and while it was a bit much for my friend, I didn't mind the flavour. After eating it with the other accompaniments on the plate, we liked it more. However, I did find the meat to be a little on the tough side, despite being cooked medium.

5. White chocolate panna cotta with espresso sauce

GET THIS! The best part of the meal hands down. There was just enough gelatine in this Panna Cotta that it had ever so slight of a jiggle, but immediately gave way to a spoon. Luscious, creamy, delectable! Probably the best Panna Cotta I've had to date.

6. Seasonal fruit tart with chantilly cream

So this was my friend's dessert. Let's just say she didn't want to share, haha. She absolutely adored the combination of flavours on this one.

I would really like to come back to Mistura to give their regular menu a go one day. I have a feeling that it could possibly affect my current rating in a positive way."}
{"text":"Terrible dining experience at Mistura this past weekend. Slow service. Less than stellar food. And a group of \"boisterous regulars\" one of whom talked loudly on cellphone for more than 30 minutes unchecked. Sent a polite note to follow up with Mistura and president write back implying I was to blame for our miserable experience because I didn't complain in the moment. He also implied that I was judgemental of their regulars (because I mentioned their baseball caps and sweatshirts) and that their behaviour went unchecked because they are good customers. A word to the wise - be a regular or stay home. Mistura is not interested in your dining experience unless you regularly drop big bucks here."}
{"text":"Had a really unpleasant experience here tonight.
As my mom and i walked into the restaurant the hostess was very nice and friendly and our server was also polite, though I noticed that after he realized we were not ordering alcohol, he was visibly disappointed and his attitude became a lot colder which made me slightly uncomfortable already. but this is nothing compared to what happened later on. After finishing ordering I decide to go to the restroom and wash my hands. Now usually, 99% of the time, I just get up and ask the nearest waiter where the restroom is and dont bother to look for it myself. However today for some reason, perhaps because some part of me had already sensed a negative vibe from the waiter closest to me, I got up and decided to look for the restroom myself just for a second, before going to the waiter immediately. After about 5seconds I sort of realized I had went the wrong way so I turned back and decided to just find someone and ask. Now keep in mind I literally only walked around for like 5 seconds. As soon as I turned back, I saw the waiter looking at me and calling out to me saying \"Ma'am, Ma'am!!\" in a SUPER impatient tone and making an extremely exaggerative gesture with his arms to signal me to go over towards him. But just as I started going towards him my server actually came up behind me and asked me if I was looking for the bathroom. So naturally I stopped for a second and turned around to tell my server that I had already found the bathroom and to thank him. Then as I went towards that waiter who was signaling me and came up to him and was actually swearing underneath his breath and saying things like, \"why didnt you listen to me\", \"i was obviously trying to direct you\" in a really impatient tone as though he was blaming me. like what the f***??? what kind of waiter in the world does that? I almost turned around the asked him what the f*** did you just say? but i had just reunited with my mom and didnt want to upset her. 
After I went back to my table I kept an eye on that waiter and found that he was extremely polite and courteous to the other guests. This leads me to conclude that either 1) he was racially discriminating against me because I am an asian female or 2) he is extremely pretentious and is only nice to his tables for the tips. Either way, extremely out of line and made me furious, completely ruined my mood. 
By the way, the food was mediocre at best and honestly kind of bad. Please save your money and dont make the mistake of coming here like I did."}
{"text":"We went here as part of my wine group Society for American wines. The GARGANELLI WITH DUCK RAGU (Fine Egg Pasta with Red Wine & Sweet Spiced Braised Duck Leg) was amazing, and the AGNELLO (Roasted Lamb Sirloin, warm fregola Sarda, escarole, black olives & cherry tomatoes) was positively delicious. Perfectly prepared. Staff were amazing. Probably rates up there as one of the best meals I've ever had!"}
{"text":"First of all, I called Mistura to say we were stuck on the Gardiner and were going to be a half hour late.  Was expecting a chippy attitude and instead, I got a 'no problem, drive safe, we do have the table booked for 8:30 but i'm sure we can find another table if you decide to stay later'.  Are you kidding me?  Then we get seated at a comfy booth - the food was scrumptious and the service couldn't have been better.
We had a fabulous evening.  Highly recommend Mistura."}
{"text":"Went for a 30th birthday celebration. The food was excellent. The best risotto was delish .  It was a very busy night, service was good but not great. We had a wonderful time and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was lovely, we loved the fried artichoke appetizer, the lobster spaghetti, beet risotto and scallop main. The room feels rather crowded and loud. If you want a booth you need to request one in advance, and you should. The real downside? The service! Excruciating. We had such a horrible server, she acted like every single thing she did for us was a terrible bother. We would ask for things and she would totally forget, then head back to our table later- remember, and spin around to head back for whatever she was forgetting this time....totally amateur and out of it. It can make a great meal into a bit of a gong show. And the food deserves better!  To me, a not so great meal with a wonderful server can leave you in a good mood afterwards.  The reverse, however....leaves me in a bad mood every time.  $450- for dinner for four should not leave you feeling grumpy and annoyed after."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to celebrating our 14th anniversary in Toronto, the fun began at Mistura's. It was so incredible. The food was beyond delicious! I just wish we had planned better, we were rushed to make sure we got to Jersey Boys on time. I had the daily special, Swordfish, it was so unbelievably good! I can't wait to go back and sit and relax and enjoy it again!"}
{"text":"We retuned for a special occasion dinner - having not been to Mistura in almost ten years. The service was good but the food lacked personality. The Branzino - fish entree was one of the better dishes but none were standouts. I believe the founding chef has left M and honestly I question the ratings that other Yelp reviewers are giving this restaurant. It was way overpriced for the quality of food preparation."}
{"text":"Two stars for the food and an extra star for the service. Good service and atmosphere but food is not very impressive. It's Friday night so the restaurant is almost full. Waiting time between dishes is a bit long and food quality is not as good as expected. The salad and appetizers are either too sour or too bitter. Beet risotto taste is good but the rice needs more time. Veal and duck confit for the main dish. Veal is over cooked and tasteless, not as tender as expected. The duck confit doesn't look the same as the picture online. It doesn't have the nice and crispy skin and is too salty. All the main dishes had a bad layout and only had a few pieces of beets as sides. We had high expectation as the rating for the restaurant is quite high online, sad it turns out like this."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp gave half stars because Mistura is a 3 and 1/2 star restaurant. A friend had selected this restaurant after hearing so much hype about it. I checked the reviews on yelp and was prepared for a 5 star meal. 

The restaurant itself is pleasant. The staff were friendly. The decor was contemporary, however it felt as if someone had converted their house into a restaurant so it had a cramped feeling. 

The booze selection was great. Martinis ranged in price from $12 - $15, which is a pretty standard price for a decent restaurant in Toronto. The wine selection was good, but of course it had high markups. The bottle of white wine we ordered was around $60. 

We shared 2 appetizers between us; Bufala con Panzanella (Tomatoes and Mozarella) and Beef Striploin Carpaccio. One reviewer spoke highly of the Tomato & Mozzarella appetizer. Although it was good, I think it's hard for a restaurant to screw up such a basic Italian dish. The Carpaccio was something new for me to try. I'm not a fan of meat that tastes like flesh ripped straight from the animal and that's what Carpaccio is, rare meat. I can't judge the restaurant for serving a dish how its supposed to be served, so I can't say much about this dish other than the overpowering truffle taste it had. 

For my main course I had the Galletto Ripieno (Cornish hen and vegetables wrapped in pancetta). The dish and presentation was good, but there was so much pancetta that the dish felt overly salty. 

For dessert we split the Warm Soft Center Chocolate Torte. I was pretty loaded from the martini and bottle of wine so I can't really judge this dessert. You could have served me a bag of M&M's at that point and I would've thought it was fine dining. 

The overall meal was good, but I think the hype is what ruined it for me. I've had just as many good meals at Il Fornello on Church Street, and for a third of the cost! (The whole meal cost over $300 at Mistura)."}
{"text":"The food was simply out of this world. On a different plane.

Among my favorite dishes was the soup special, a chicken stock with a kind of dumpling with farm veggies. Sounds simple... but not the way they made it.

The setting could be cozier. I suspect the real regulars get to enjoy better tables & private rooms.

If you don't genuinely appreciate great food, you'll probably find something small to nitpick here. We were extremely pleased."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very accommodating- seating us in a private room which provided an intimate setting without sacrificing service. 
The wait staff were very attentive and friendly- ensuring that we were well taken care of throughout the night. 
Having been most of our first time dining at Mistura, the waiter took the time to explain each of the dishes that each of us ordered. 
When the food arrived, it was exactly as was described and the presentation delectable. 
I ordered the CARCIOFINI- the crispy fried artichokes to start, and CAPESANTE- the seared N.S. Scallops. Both dishes were delicious. My partner ordered the RISOTTO ROSSO- the red beet risotto which was also spectacular. Unfortunately the  VEGETARINO- eggplant dish was bland and felt like it was missing something. But aside from this, everyone in my party thoroughly enjoyed their meals and had a wonderful night at Mistura. 
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who hasn't had the chance to go-"}
{"text":"Winterlicious review. Kale, grape, far to and root salad was amazing warm winter salad. Orata was tasty and very fresh and the grilled fennel was a delicious accompaniment Companion enjoyed the pork chop.  The warm lemon tart with merengue brûlée was a nice tart finish. Highly recommend this restaurants winterlicious menu. Service quick, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for Valentine's Day this year. We came to the early sitting at 6 p.m. We were pleasantly welcomed by the chef himself. He was friendly and jolly and it was a nice treat to see him at the front. They had also decorated the place with rose petals on the floor and each table for the occasion. The restaurant was pretty busy and the tables were close together so we could hear the conversations of the other people throughout the night. In fact once the lady beside us had enough wine she started recommending dessert to us. I found this funny.

The food was magnificent. I tried the chestnut soup based on the recommendations here. It was good but a little bit sweet and a little bit cold. But it was definitely interesting.

We tried the beet risotto and this was for sure the most delicious risotto I have ever tasted. Perfectly cooked and full with flavour.

I then had the veal cheek and marrow cannon special which was also very delicious. I never realized how big a veal cheek is and I haven't had bone marrow before in a restaurant and I was very pleased with the presentation (in the bone with a tiny spoon for digging it out).

The wine list was big but not too big (some restaurants have way too much choice and you get lost in the list). 

Overall, the experience was awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone. Our server was very good and came to serve us at the proper times. There was one server tho for the tables beside us that was very chatty with the customers. Almost to the point of being annoying. At first I thought that the customers were his friends but when he chatted for too long at each table, I realized that was just his personality. Sort of overbearing."}
{"text":"I've been to Mistura on numerous occasions, from corporate functions to dinner with friends.  I must say that Chef Capra never fails to disappoint!  If you try nothing else, you MUST try the ribs on their appetizer menu... it is melt in your mouth delicious.  Their Creme Brulee is awesome, and the servers always have their A-Game on!"}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant twice for Valentines day and I am so surprised the overall rating is so low!

Yes this place is pricy but every dish I have had there was amazing. If still available, I strongly recommend the red beet risotto, wild boar ravioli and generally the wild boar.

I would love to visit again when I am prepared to do quite some damage to my wallet."}
{"text":"Service - A+
Atmosphere - great if you like an upbeat, casual but classy environment on a weekday night.
Drinks - great wine list. Dirty martini was nicely mixed.
Food - Had the flat-iron steak. Cooked to perfection.
I'm giving it a 4/5 because everything was great and as expected. I didn't get a wow factor though."}
{"text":"Service is amazing, food is 10/10. Very suitable for special occasions, highly recommend."}
{"text":"the veal has very terrible smell which doesnt even frash. Duck confit is too salty, I have to keep drinking water. Overall the display is very bad. It's expensive and not worth."}
{"text":"Would probably give it 3.5 stars but will bump it up for the sake of having a nice evening. 

This restaurant is everything you should expect an expensive restaurant to be. Nice (but uninspired) decor. Wide seats and table space for comfort. Competent, prompt and helpful service. Well presented plates using top quality ingredients.  Extensive wine list at an acceptable mark-up.

The problem is I find there is a diminishing point of returns on a meal over $200. 

Yes it was all very \"nice\" but at $300 I guess I wanted something a bit more special and memorable."}
{"text":"Listen y'all Massimo's bolognese is apparently amazing, so we caved and went.

I had been warned that it was pricey and normally I don't give in to people who say \"I won't order pasta at a restaurant because I can make it myself!\" but after a visit to Mistura,  i may join the non-pasta ordering restaurant guests.

Much like most I've seen Massimo on TV and love his jolly nature that makes you think you will have good and honest Italian cuisine, but the restaurant looks more like that of someone who is uptight.

Tables around us included older Forest Hill types, who clearly don't get out much because they were dressed like they are going to a formal event, dress up and Italian seem odd to me. 

Surprisingly, the staff is actually very friendly and approachable, which makes the place even more lost in identity. A friendly chef, a pricey trying to be stiff restaurant and nice staff and I swear we have a schizo.

We ordered a fried artichoke appetizer with a buffalo mozzarella salad, the artichoke app was great but if it wasn't for the mozzarella I would have cared very little about the salad.

We also ordered the infamous bolognese and a red beet risotto, the risotto was interesting and the bolognese was good but extremely oily.

Although we ordered dessert, I wouldn't bother and coffee was just ok.

Overall I think this place is overpriced for Italian and stiff. I wouldn't come back and think they actually end up on summer or winterlicious, which may be the time to waste your money if any at all OR if you are a restaurant rookie, this may be a good option for the naive girl you want to impress.

Better yet, make it to the suburbs for Massimo's Fraticelli, which is cheaper and better but still kinda meh."}
{"text":"The restaurant is from the acclaimed Massimo chef and doesn't really live up to all the hype. The food met expectations but wasn't leaving much of an impression. 

Being an Italian restaurant, we didn't venture out beyond the basics. Started with the calamari which lacked any distinctive character. The  carpaccio was very delicate and well seasoned.

Wild boar agnolotti was surprisingly complex and the farfalline with lobster was sweet and inviting.

The biggest disappointment was the service, in particular the pretentious host staff. For the price point, not up to par and certainly made us feel like a return trip would only be had if the food somehow came up a level or two."}
{"text":"Am a Massimo fan from Food TV and his place had been on my list for a while.  First impressions - Old / uptight crowd.  Felt very formal, was packed on a Wednesday - lots of noise and energy...but of the 50 / 60 year old variety.  Our server was fantastic - the service was very professional.  The menu had some great takes on Classic Italian - portions were generous.  We had the Artichokes, The Carpaccio and the Bolognese...All were good - though the carpaccio lacked acidity / depth.  I was very impressed with the pasta...would recommend.  Wine list was also decent.  My negatives are:
1.  Price - very expensive - a bit over the top to pay more than 30 for a bowl of pasta, and all starters are in the 20 range...
2. Crowd / Energy - Much more suited to retirees...

Worth trying and Massimo is still a favourite...but think I will stick to watching him on TV."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh Massimo. Ohhh my lovely, tasty Massimo. Why can't you live at my house and cook me dinner EVERY night??? In my wildest dreams, he is my personal chef and brings me breakfast in bed as well. Ohhh Massimo.

OK. Down to serious business. This is definitely in my top 5 restos in TO.

My favourite meal I've eaten here? Check it - I pasted it right from the menu:

BUFALA CON PANZANELLA
Bufala Mozzarella with Heirloom Tomato, Herb Toasted Croutons, Fresh Basil, Red onion Shaved Celery & Tomato Vinaigrette

RED BEET RISOTTO
Classically Mistura

And the beet risotto. Come on. Really? I really get to eat an entire bowl of this? UnbeLEEEEVable. See, they don't include a description on the menu because it is INDESCRIBABLE. It is un-word-ly, sans paroles, somehow-gross-beets-became-heavenly good.

A note on the wine list here: I don't drink red wine. But I effing drink red wine when I'm eating here. Got me? I have 2 words for you: Chianti Classico. OMG. 

And just to make a caution point about other reviews here, I really don't believe a restaurant can or should be judged during Winterlicious/Summerlicious. 

It is the COOOOOLEST that Massimo always comes out and says hi. The COOLEST. I love him. I love his food. I love Mistura."}
{"text":"My husband spends way too much time watching Beer Buddies and Restaurant Makeover. Massimo Capra, the flamboyant and gregarious Italian chef is a mainstay on both of these shows so on our last anniversary I decided to take my husband to Mistura for dinner just so he could finally meet Massimo. For those of you who don't know, Chef Capra is heavily influenced by the northern Italian region, in particular the Emilio Romagna & the Piedmont regions, which feature risottos and wild games. 

I made a reservation for 8:00 PM. on a Saturday evening. We arrived promptly on time only to be told our table wasn't ready. Obie Dokie. There as no seat at the small bar inside the front door so we stood for about ten minutes. Finally a seat opened up at the bar and so we decided to have a cocktail and wait. Well the waiting went on and on and we were beginning to get a little bit annoyed at this point especially since we made these reservations over three weeks prior. The gentlemen host said to us \"well we have this table just inside the door if you want to sit there...\" I looked at him straight in eye and without hesitation I said \"listen my man, we made these reservations  3 weeks ago and if you think I'm sitting in the doorway of the path of traffic to eat my anniversary dinner you'd better give your head a shake...\". He walked over to the bartender and said \"all their drinks at the bar are on the house\". So we sat at the bar for an hour and a half....and we drank.  The bartender knew we were pissed and so did the manager.  Massimo came out to the bar and apologized, explaining they had gotten so busy. At 9:45 PM. we were finally seated. 

For starters we had a Chestnut soup and a pasta dish that had lobster in it. Both were delicious and delicate. Chestnuts are very popular in Italy and are used quite often in cooking. The lobster shredded apart beautifully, a sign that it is fresh and not over cooked. The sauce was sort of buttery but broth like at the same time. 

For mains (yup, you guessed it, its the beef for me) I had a tenderloin and my husband had the lamb shank. Both meats were cooked to perfection. I love it when you don't need a knife to cut beef. Both meat dishes were sided with great vegetables such as braised swiss chard and french asparagus. One of the mainstays at Mistura is the trademark Beet Risotto. I saw several plates of it go by us and while we didn't try it, it looked interesting. During dinner Massimo came out once again and sat down and had a glass of wine with us. We ordered a drop dead gorgeous Amarone with a hefty price tag but hey it was a special occasion. We got to talk about food and we had told Massimo that we had travelled extensively in the north of Italy and how much we enjoyed the chestnut soup.  Dennis told him that chestnuts were very much part of his childhood memories. 

We didn't order dessert but Massimo sent out dessert to us anyway to mark the special occasion. We had a sponge like cake that was split by a layer of mascarpone cheese and heavy cream and then topped with fresh berries and a sherry like sauce. In addition to that the Chef specially sent out a dish of poached chestnuts that he had cooked in a grappa.  It was his nod to my husband's fond memories of childhood chestnuts.  

Other than the long wait at the beginning of the evening we enjoyed Mistura and at least they tried to make up for it by picking up the bar tab which I'm pretty sure was fairly hefty! :) I just love that champagne! On a final note Mistura has now opened up a fancy smancy cocktail lounge up over top of the restaurant and when we were leaving Mistura there was droves of people waiting to get in upstairs. Price tags at Mistura are high end so be prepared."}
{"text":"I've been to Mistura before for their \"regular menu\" but I decided to try it with Summerlicious. Must say; Mistura does no wrong in my eyes except for Summerlicious menu. 

Fixed Menu:

Chopped salad with vinaigrette/ Watermelon with Ontario Feta
Orata with Crispy Panella/ Leg of Lamb with Potatoes
Seasoned Fruit tart with Chantilly Cream

Lets just say; Chopped salad was a bit heavy on the vinaigrette but the mix of flavors worked, Melon and Feta; nothing to rave about. Orata and Panella is AMAZING. Leg of lamb tasted like what you would imagine Body odor to taste like (sorry) and the Fruit tart was warm and tart; quite delicious. 

As you can imagine; having been there before there is an expectation but overall service was great- Massimo comes out after every seating. Food for summerlicious was cool. But definitely go to Mistura for the regular menu; the Duck is mouth watering; the agnolotti is out of this world. 

It is worth the 5 star price; not the summerlicious $$."}
{"text":"This is one of Toronto's better restaurants.  The food is largely Italian and fantastic.  The wine selection is vast.  The staff is attentive, knowledgeable and will treat you like royalty.  Call ahead and be prepared to spend some money."}
{"text":"Our meal at Mistura was positively stunning down to the last delicious detail...along with Scaramouche, this is without a doubt one of Toronto's top restaurants.

The interior is sophisticated and refined. The service is impeccable. The wine advice was on point.

Recommended dishes: beef carpaccio with truffle lemon dressing was perfectly executed and full of flavour. Agnolotti with minced wild boar inside and topped with a few port-stewed cherries (!!!) was exceptional. A friend had beautifully cooked tagliatelle with lip-smacking ground beef/veal/sausage that was equally delicious (pastas at this restaurant are clearly a great bet). And the balsamic glazed lamb ribs were also superb!

For dessert, the lemon posset and affogato left us dizzyingly satisfied.

Bravo to 'celebrity' chef Massimo...our dining experience at Mistura was truly top notch."}

Guess they have never read her .Not bad execution but Muddy and clumsy at times.Rapini side disappointing , veal thick cut - tasty. Friend liked light smoked salmon main?odd?Pasta Overcooked,with god knows ( Bolognese!!)what on it including hot sausage  bordering on terrible.famous Italian specialty Peach Crumble ,devoured across the table. Fair service. Irritating Chef appearance . Pricey? The echoed din made for impenetrable conversation .
       Nope!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We were looking forward to a special meal and it started badly with a table that looked into the kitchen and a waiter named Jules with attitude. The food was average and lacked appropriate level of seasoning.But the kicker was that the waiter did not like the amount of tip we left (15%) and asked us if that was all we intended to leave!!! He embarrassed us into leaving more. The manager wasn't much interested in the situation. Mistura has lost 6 good cutomers."}
{"text":"I finally checked out Mistura during Winterlicious 2017. I can't believe I waited this long! Service here is top notch and will make anyone feel like a VIP. for starters we had the kale salad and the bolognese. Our waitress told us the bolognese is the star of the menu and she was not kidding. I have had DREAMS of that bolognese since, and I didn't even order it! A small bite off of my friend's plate is enough to have won me over, I'm a Mistura bolognese believer for life now. My salad was excellent too, as was my orata mains. Desserts were great too. I can't wait to visit again. This place is truly special and has that wow factor that reminds you why going out to eat is worth the money."}
{"text":"Two words: Beet risotto.

I took my chances ordering this because I'm a huuuge risotto fan but not so much a beets fan - And i won. The dish was one of the greatest risottos i've ever had, full of rich flavours and a good portion size (although I wanted another serving after that's for sure). The colour of it was gorgeous too. For dessert our waiter recommended the pine nut and honey tart, which seemed a bit odd to me at first because you usually associate tarts with pecans , but it was incredible. There was just enough crunch and sweetness.

The decor was simple contemporary, maybe a bit too crowded but then again I was there on the weekend. 

The prices were a little upscale but that's justified for the excellent quality of food and the fact that it's Massimo Capra's lovechild. If you're lucky, he'll come out and say hello! Our waiter was helpful and attentive, though service was a bit on the slow side. 

This is a great place for a special date or birthday, but be sure to make reservations as it does fill up fast. Overall, i'm definitely coming back and I'm excited to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is classy and comfortable.  Service is attentive, friendly and professional.  It should be noted that this is refined dining. 

Risotto excellent.  Other dishes were perfect - flavours and appearance excellent.  We enjoyed a range of dishes from the artichokes and soup to veal and pasta.  Wines suggestions were very good.  Have been here many times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not yet written a review for this heaven. First off, Chef Capra is a frequent visitor of the dinning room. It shows that the man loves his job and likes to see the happy faces of his customers. And happy faces he sees. The food is godly, there really is no other expression you could have after the 'buds have tasted the food. 

Seriously, the food is so good that even if the venue and service were horrible, I would still give it 5 stars and recommend you went there. Fortunately, the venue is cozy, and the service is excellent. So now you really have no excuse not to go. 

No really, just go."}
{"text":"My Second visit to Mistura Restaurant............ Not too many restaurants have valet parking, so it was a treat to have someone else take care of your car for $10. Arrived into the restaurant and was immediately greeted by the Hostess and shown to our table. The restaurant had a nice warm atmosphere. Menu had a great selection of appetizers and Main courses to choose from, although pasta selection was limited.

We ordered the Bean soup, it was delicious. My husband ordered the rabbit, it was fatty and without flavour, I Had the lamb, it was good except the meat was more on the rare side when I had asked for medium to well done. If our waiter would have had the time to ask I would have sent it back to be cooked more. Presentation and the marriage of flavours is so important to the palette, I do feel that was achieved.  For me the portion size ratio to price was high. All in all I had an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"A group of 8 went out to dinner and almost ordered the whole menu. Many of the apps were way over priced for the portion. $18 dollars for 2 Artichokes REALLY!! I don't care if you flew around the world and back again that cant be justified. I very surprised their aren't more Italians out there yelling WHERES THE FOOD. Taste on some thing was ok considering pricing. The only thing that was exceptional was the duck confit. It was very well portioned and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately it was my buddies dish but was kind enough for me to try. Service was pretty bad. She was too busy and couldn't handle her section."}
{"text":"The place was easy to find, and the cab driver even knew it by name.  We made our reservation, and there was a table immediately ready for us upon our arrival, did not encounter seating problems some of the reviewers mentioned.

Onto the food!  I've had/tried the following menu items:

1. Carpaccio di manzo
I was not impressed with this dish, especially having read so many reviews raving about it.  The presentation was gorgeous, and the concept is interesting... on paper: Beef Striploin, Padano, Black Truffle Shavings, Arugula, Fresh Lemon Juice & EVOO.  However, when I ate it, I really felt that it was missing a binding agent.  It was as if I was eating a very bland arugula salad and a piece of salty meat.  The truffle, lemon juice and EVOO were nice, but it was too subtle to tie the meat and salad together.

2. Costine d'agnello
The lamb was slightly better than the carpaccio, but, again, the flavour was way too subtle for me, especially for lamb.  Also, the lamb was too fatty for med-rare, I didn't enjoy biting into the fatty parts, it made the dish very heavy.  I feel that this subtle approach would work much better on a more delicate piece of meat such as kobe beef.

3. Galletto Ripieno
Simple verdict: too salty!  I think the problem was that the stuffing was too salty, and combined with the pancetta, it was just too much.  The chicken was cooked very nicely though.

4. Risotto Rosso
The risotto was fantastic.  The rice was al-dente and cooked perfectly.  The food had a very vibrant red colour from the beets, and it was very pleasant to look at.  The subtle sweetness was very refreshing; even though I'm sure the dish was loaded with cream, it did not feel heavy at all!

5. Agnolotti di cinghiale
This was probably my favourite dish, and it really saved the meal.  I was slightly disappointed when our waiter informed us that they were out of wild boar, and the agnolotti were stuffed with ground duck instead, but the dish turned out really well.  I particularly enjoyed the addition of the sour cherries.  It was really nice to have something light in between the agnolotti, like little breaks.  This dish was slightly heavy, which was great as an entree.

Additionally, my GF really liked the pine nut tart (crostata di pinoli), claiming it was the best dessert she has ever eaten.

Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience and I really liked how it was possible to order appetizer-sized entrees.  Our waiter was attentive, and the food came relatively quickly.  Oh, and the house red was quite good.

3.5, bumped to 4."}
{"text":"Worth the $45 for Winterlicous, not sure I would pay full price.  Advice to restaurant -- reduced payment for Winterlicious should not mean reduced service."}
{"text":"Mistura was amazing! I was happily surprised when we arrived to a dimly lit restaurant - the photos online show otherwise. Anyway, the atmosphere was very warm and perfect for date night.
We had risotto with truffle (not sure what the hype of truffle is but the risotto was delicious), duck prosciutto, gnocchi in a yellow tomato sauce with crab meat (my main) and seared sea bass (bae's main). My gnocchi was amazing and I HIGHLY recommend it.
Drinks! I had 1..2..3 lychee martinis because they were very good - this is coming from someone who is not a big drinker.
The service was excellent; our server Tom was very, very kind and attentive, and that experience really put the cherry on top.

I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This review is for summerlicious 2016 (dinner)
 
Unlike other restos, Mistura was totally willing to let our party of five order either from the summerlicious or their regular menu and mix them up.
The spaghettini starter was almost as satisfying as the main, both in terms of content and quantity. Great, aglio e olio spaghetti and perfectly charred (I think it was charred?) tiger shrimp.
 
The oven roasted chicken main with a sweet onion puree and snap peas was simple but also satisfying and a more than generous portion size. The chicken came in 3 meaty slices/pieces and by piece #2 I was pretty well full.
 
I had high hopes for the tiramisu for dessert but it ended up being my least favorite item. The presentation was lovely but it was topped with some kind of sweet crumbled cookie/wafer object which I found too overpowering. I need to get to the mascarpone fast! Once past the top layer, the remainder of the tiramisu was light and pleasing.
 
Must point out the service was super warm from start to finish. What appeared to be the owner chatted with our table for a while, indicating he wanted to make the place more appealing to \"young folks\" like us. Must admit the interior was formal (white tablecloths) but in a heavy, drab kind of way. They've got the food down, just need to update the interior."}
{"text":"I went here on a hot date and the great food, combined with my amazing personality, made it a very successful one!

I will admit that it was hard to play it cool when I saw the prices in the wine list, so it's probably not somewhere the average Joe could go very often.  In fact, there was a moment or two where I wondered if I made the wrong career choices, but I think on special occasions,  business dinners, or anytime when you aren't planning on guzzling 4 liters of wine, this place is awesome!

I'll happily go back."}
{"text":"I went last week as part of the Winterlicious event, and I'll say it's one of the best ones out there.

The place was hustling and bustling with both regulars and winterlicious diners. The service was friendly and quick, and the food was AMAZING!

Their warm mushroom arugala salad was dressed well, and I loved that they diced my quail leg into bite size pieces (very thoughtful). The main dishes of shrimps were perfectly cooked and not chewy, and the pork loin chop was beyond juicy and delicious.

I would definitely come back to this place for dinner anytime of the year as a regular patron :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try mistura again after 12 years and are so glad we did. We were going to the theatre at 8 and arrived a bit late for our 530 reservations. The staff were great and seated us quickly and the valet made parking very simple . The waiter was very educated when it came to the wine selection who we found out was the owners son. Kudos to him and the rest of the staff for the wonderful service . They had a great deal of staff that made the experience just wonderful . They were attentive but let us enjoy the experience.

The crispy shrimp was fantastic the blend of Mellon and shrimp was a delight. I wouldn't of thought that  the 2 went together but they sure did. My wife had the fried artichoke which was again delicious ... I was saddened that the organic rabbit was unavailable as I read such great things about it but the server suggested i try a special the ossobuco which was tender and delicious which was on a bed of risotto. A very nice touch was lightly breaded and fried bone marrow which I have never had before . Just wonderful as it melted on your tongue. My wife had the lamb ribs which were also excellent.  

We were stuffed but the server suggested the panna cotta which did not disappoint. 

We finished the meal with espressos and lattes coupled with a spook soaked in melted bitter sweet chocolate ... beautiful end to a meal I am still thinking about a day later . I will be back.

The ambiance is a bit dated but other than that well done!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, but didn't have a great experience here. Not a fan of the lobster linguine. Atmosphere a bit 'old boys cigar club-ish'. Really not sure what the hype about this place is. Fraticelli's is great though."}
{"text":"Mistura is a lovely upscale restaurant that serves contemporary Italian cuisine. Mistura is run by a long-time restaurateur, Paolo Paolini, who has owned several restaurants throughout the years including the critically-acclaimed Splendido, which he sold in 1996. Soon after his departure from Splendido, he opened Mistura with Chef Massimo Capra in 1997 to positive reviews. The restaurant has been in business for 19 years, and is still thriving today as a result of their ever-changing menus, and warm hospitality. 

Chef Massimo Capra no longer helms the kitchen, and has passed it on to Chef Klaus Rohrich, who has worked in the kitchen of Mistura and Sopra for several years. Chef Klaus Rohrich may not be Italian, but he certainly knows how to take simple Italian cooking methods, and elevate it. With that being said, the menu at Mistura draws inspiration from traditional Italian cooking, but combines it with local, seasonal ingredients when possible. The menu changes seasonally, and we got a taste of the new Spring menu at the luncheon.

Prior to our meal, we were treated to an array of small bites including a selection of Chef Klaus' signature charcuterie, pistachio infused mortadella, capicollo, bresaola, lonza affumicata.

My favorite starter was the crispy gulf shrimp and cantaloupe trusses, which were delectable. The sweet sauce and cantaloupe trusses was the perfect complement to the lightly coated shrimp. 

We were treated to a plate containing a trio of appetizers; the balsamic glazed Ontario lamb riblets coupled with minted yoghurt, Ontario wild boar agnolotti in sundried sour cherry jus, and crispy fried artichoke with \"gribiche\". I would definitely come back just to order a platter of the Ontario lamb riblets, as it was that good. Normally, I find lamb hard to eat, as it's quite tough and potent sometimes. However, the Ontario lamb riblets served at Mistura were surprisingly tender, and the sticky Balsamic glazed perfectly coated the ribs.

Chef Klaus Rohrich delivers a delicious entree; ballotine of organic free range chicken, squash puree, roasted brussel sporut leaves, roasted buttercup squash and butter sage crackling. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and sat in a layer of velvety-like squash puree. I also really enjoyed the butter sage crackling, as it provided a nice crunch to the dish.

Lunch was rather filling, but we ended the lunch with the Mistura Inverted Cassata for dessert. It was a refreshing dessert, and rather light as well. Great way to end a meal!

Despite it being a fine-dining establishment, Paolo Paolini prides himself on providing a warm and upscale atmosphere with no hint of pretentiousness. All of the staff members are friendly, quick without being too overbearing that you feel rushed. Private functions are also available as Mistura has two private dining rooms. Additionally, upstairs of the restaurant is Sopra, the second-floor event space which can seat up to 110 people."}
