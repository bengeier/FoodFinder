{"text":"You can tell that the Chocolaterian is new and that the owners are truly passionate about what they do. We went for dessert and had an apple cranberry gallette and the caramel cashew chocolate torte. Both were good, but the torte could have benefitted from being a bit colder to give it a slightly more solid texture. We each had a glass of wine with dessert. Although I felt the selection of wine varietals was perfect for pairing with dessert, the prices seemed a bit high per glass. 

This place has potential for incredible ambience. The original wood cabinets and fall decorations highlighted the Chocolaterian's merchandise beautifully. However, the dessert cases were quite bare (possibly because we went late at night), and the selection slimmer than what I expected. The overhead flourescent lights were too much. Some lamps or fixtures would do wonders for this place. I also think it would be cool if the Chocolaterian had books or magazines available for its patrons. This would encourage people to stay longer and likely buy more items and would contribute to the overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try based on Yelp reviews.  Delish! 

Stopped here for V-day dessert and were pleasantly surprised.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  They were patient with us as we looked over every dessert in their case and tried to decide.  They even explained to me what a Parisian hot chocolate is, and I have plans to try it on my next visit as it is a dessert onto itself!  I also plan to try their ugly cookie :)

Nice, historic building.  Viewing window into the kitchen area to watch them prepare items.  

That night they had some live music which was also a nice treat."}
{"text":"I am  UW Student and I often take the divre/bike ride out to Chocolaterian to escape the campus and eat a quality cookie. Let me tell you, The Ugly cookie is divine and the Molasses cookie is my usual. Both are perfect for a study session. The Mint cookie sandwich is a little grainy, but otherwise good. The Baristas are always top notch and the music never disappoints. Chocolaterian is worth the extra effort and will always be one of my favorite spots in Madison."}
{"text":"I love chocolate.  Good quality chocolate.  Really.   A lot.  Anyway if I were just rating this place on their food I would give them 3 stars.  Their food is good, but (for the most part) it isn't great and it IS pricey.  I've had the quiche a number of times, and while the ingredients tasted good together the crust was a bit soft (it had clearly been microwaved).  As far as the main event, the chocolate items, again they are mostly good but not great.  The cakes have been a little on the dry side and the shortbread cookies are not nearly buttery enough.  The following items I would recommend, however:
-Chocolate mousse (rich, delicious, filling, well presented)
-Ugly cookies (These have a nice texture and great assortment of varied ingredients)
-The raspberry and turtle tarts (Both are rich, pretty and well done)

I give the atmosphere 5 stars, however.  It is a really nice place to sit down on a date or with some friends.  The atmosphere is fairly cozy and there is plenty of seating so that even when it is full, you can find somewhere to set yourself down.  It has that coffee shop feel where you can plant yourself for hours if you feel like it.  Also, the intricate decor is rotated on a regular basis which is fun to look at and adds to the positive mood.  

If this place was just about its chocolate items I probably wouldn't come here much, but with the food and atmosphere combined I do end up stopping by quite a bit.  Atmosphere+food=4 stars."}
{"text":"This review is so painful to write, as I really really really wanted to like this new spot. I was so excited to live a couple blocks away upon moving back to Madison. I have now given Chocolaterian it's third and FINAL try. I really don't know where to start.

First off: the atmosphere in the space, including wonderful view into the bakery is nothing short of impressive and comfortable. This would totally be a place I could see myself spending a lot of time if everything else wasn't awful.

On all three visits I have felt as though I was inconveniencing the counter person. The entire interaction felt awkward every time - and 2 out of 3 times I was charged the incorrect price and had to point it out (luckily before paying!) 

Overall I have been unimpressed with the small selection in the case, and would like to note the shocking lack of chocolate items.... how has no one else remarked on this???!!!!

As I have now tried a lot of items that the cafe offers I feel comfortable writing this review.  Here is what I have tried so far:

Chocolate Caramel Tart: good but not memorable
Shortbread Cookie: bland and crisp.. shortbread should be buttery and crumbly right??
Ricotta Cookie: Wierd, and not impressive enough to justify featuring it in the case daily.. 
Caramel filled Chocolate on a stick: Probably the worst thing I have tried here yet, my five year old didn't even want to finish it. For a place called Chocolatarian a treat like this should be a simple knock out of the park... why and how have you failed me so badly?
Apple turnover: looked and tasted exactly like you bought it for 40 cents at any grocery store. 
Badger Bite: quite tasty, way way to expensive.
Quiche: My friend who was starving ordered this on our first visit. She remarked that it was way too big for one person and bland, she ate the whole thing for lunch anyways - and felt ill the rest of the evening. On my third visit I myself was looking for something savory and decided to give it a try for myself. And, oh my - AWFUL absolutely awful, bland watery mess. Way too much milk added to the eggs maybe? I dont know the texture was horrific and the taste worse. I had to spit it out immediately I couldn't even swallow it. Even if it was good who wants a quiche to themselves THAT big with no salad or anything?? Very strange choice. 
Hot Chocolate: IS really really good and I have enjoyed it immensely twice.
Ugly Cookie: Not bad, but again really unimpressive why would this be a special daily feature??

Overall, to me this place feels like an amateur home bake-sale fail. And to top it off the customer service didn't do much to make me feel it worth wasting any more money in the future hoping for improvement. 

Also, yelp staff - I don't think it is fair to count reviews of a class taught at an establishment legitimate reviews of the business for a prospective customer.. there should be a separate page for that as it looks as many of those reviewers have ONLY attended a class and cannot remark on the cafe itself."}
{"text":"So, so good. Parisian hot chocolate is my husband's favorite (it's thick and rich and perfectly sized) but I cannot say enough about the lemon tart. It has become the only thing I order that I won't share. Delicious."}
{"text":"Chocoletarian is great - It's the kind of place you can comfortably hang out at. The sweets are consistently good, especially the ugly cookie (which has pistachio, chocolate chips, and toffee), passion fruit tart, and kouign amann (which should be reheated). The hot chocolate is unique in that it is exceptionally rich, but it is not as good as Chez Nanou's. The one disappointment is that they do not create new sweets often, so it is easy to become bored of the place. They also have some savory food specials: a quiche, sandwich, and soup. These are passable if you are in the mood, but I would never seek them out (the one exception being their beer cheese soup, which was delicious)."}
{"text":"Lots of yummy sweets and good coffee. I really enjoy studying and meeting friends there. 
I was so pleased with their chicken Caesar salad too!"}
{"text":"I was beyond excited for this place to open, however with each of my visits, I get more and more disappointed.
The staff never seems to know what is going on - who ordered what, if they have all the rest of your food, etc...  The macaroons are nothing to rave about.  In fact the lavender ones have three times the amount of flavoring they need.  The tarts are too big and lack flavor.  Anyone can do a chocolate tart - but it's BoRiNg!  Looking for a bit more pizzazz there... or even variety.  
The caramel cookies were good when they opened - a caramel like buttercream, but the last few times there has been a caramel drizzle on it, which is gross and too much.  
Either they try too hard, or they aren't trying hard enough -- not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"Great service with a smile (the person behind the counter was very patient with us, as we perused all the delicious treats available). The Parisian hot chocolate is awesome, and a definite must, as its like drinking a chocolate candy bar. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a treat, to find this Parisian style sipping chocolate!!  I would give 100 stars for this, if I could."}
{"text":"The parisian hot chocolate was delicious. I also loved the chocolate caramel tart. It's a very cozy place..a perfect place for chocolate lovers."}
{"text":"Love this place!
Great neighborhood.
The Parisian hot chocolate is to die for. 
super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I actually think this place is pretty good, especially for Madison, but the prices are really off-putting.  For instance they do a very nice chocolate caramel tart here, but it is seven dollars.  In comparison, Floriole, a not unknown bakery in Chicago, has a very similar tart of better quality for only five.  Similarly, 3.50 for an espresso shot of hot chocolate seems a bit excessive.

So if you can handle the prices the good stuff here is the chocolate mousse which has a touch of alcohol to add a unique twist.  The pistachio ice cream sandwich is tasty too, but does not actually use ugly cookies as implied.  The aforementioned tart is good as well as the chocolate raspberry tart.  Finally, the flourless chocolate cookie is actually excellent.

What is not good is the regular chocolate chip cookie which doesn't stand up to even the Tollhouse recipe.  The ugly cookie has no theme and is just a bunch of stuff crammed into a cookie with some underwhelming pistachios.  We also had a dark chocolate bar with pistachios that also had bad pistachios and a chocolate with no flavor.  We didn't even finish it.  Our friend said the macarons were decent, but they look so small.

Everything said, I would probably still come by occasionally since this place doesn't have much competition in Madison."}
{"text":"Needed a chocolate fix after a pizza dinner and we found this little place. Very friendly counter help assisted us with choosing our desserts. A little bit pricey, but highly enjoyable. Large, invitingly decorated space would allow for lingering and enjoying several more items off the menu. Parking lot next door a plus."}
{"text":"Ugly cookies and the monona bar completed my life! I've never been so happy with a bakery. Who could complain about sugary goodness? I don't know what to say except everyone needs to try everything in this place. It has a cozy feel with spots to sit comfortably while they nosh, too."}
{"text":"Came across this on my facebook feed and we thought we would try it today during our tour of the east side of Madison. So glad we did! The tuscan bean and kale soup was mouthwateringly yummy, the quiche was light and fluffy, and the grand finale of a slice of flourless chocolate cake was divine... we will be back!"}
{"text":"I really think I'm a sucker for the dark wood.

Sampled the hazelnut dacquoise, the layered chocolate cake, and a potato and leek galette and left with a smile on my face.

Yall get two thumbs from me way way up and I hope to come back again soon. Your food was delicious and the desserts varied and executed in superb fashion. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I went to the Chocolatarian recently with a friend after receiving an email from Yelp - Madison Loves Chocolate was the title  -   that featured a list of cafes and restaurants that specialize in deserts . I was actually pretty excited to find out about this place, I mean, a cafe with a chocolate theme? Sounds like Heaven! So I read through some of the reviews, checked out the menu, grabbed a friend and headed over. I'm so glad I did, this place is wonderful! The atmosphere is warm and cozy with low-key, casual decor. Our server was very friendly and our food was delivered quickly. My only complaint is that my panini was a bit on the cold side but that didn't stop me from enjoying it. Besides, one of my biggest reasons for going to the Chocolatarian was to try the Parisian Hot Chocolate I read so many reviews mentioning. And WOW. Is that stuff ever delicious! It's on the pricey side for how little you get, however, it's incredibly rich and thick - think a hot fudge-like texture -  and I think a larger amount would have just been a waste. We actually couldn't finish what we had! 
I very much enjoyed my experience at the Chocolatarian and  I'll definitely be coming back. There are so many wonderful looking deserts I want to try!"}
{"text":"Alright so this is more a review of the Ugly Cookie than the Chocolaterian as that is all I have ever gotten there but that cookie is worth the trip love it."}
{"text":"Oh be still my damn heart. This place is a dream. I used to work nearby and I cannot tell you how many times I went for the peanut butter badger baits or an ugly cookie. Or the damn Oriel (a homemade version of the Oreo cookie that will make you think you're no longer part of this earth). Everything here is great. I've eaten one of all the things and wish I got there more not working in the area anymore. A true gem. I taste the heart and soul baked into everything. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This cafe has a great atmosphere. It is a great place for a leisurely chat with a friend over some tasty treats. Even though it is summer, I find myself craving their thick hot drinking chocolate. It is so thick and rich that it is served with a small spoon."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor - go here. The ugly cookies (everything in em) and the Parisian hot chocolate will make you cry. Chill place, great vibe and employees"}
{"text":"I love it all! 
Coffee, cookies, brownies, cool hangout spot, awesome staff. 
Awesome addition to the Atwood neighborhood."}
{"text":"Get the strawberry-lemon cake. Not chocolate, but it is killer! Get it while you can."}
{"text":"4.75 stars

Macaroons people. Macaroons. Get these tender morsels from Heaven (aka France). Fluffy cookies with a soft gooey middle and a creme brulee like exterior. Then a flavor icing type middle filling and they sandwich it together! Just perfect. Also they have hot chocolate! And coffee! And some other random good desserts. But seriously, get the macaroons. Half point off for the inconsistent soft level on the pistachio flavor - my favorite.

The space is charming. Plenty of room for families. People can see some kitchen dealings. It's also got a cute European feel. Perfect dessert or after dinner place."}
{"text":"I really good place. There is a lot of space to work and study. Also, there are a lot of chocolate to choose. Parisian hot chocolate is always my favorite !"}
{"text":"Great selection of desserts - the barista knows how to pour a mean cappuccino!  I will be going back the next time I'm in Madison - in fact, it was so good, it might be worth a casual drive by~"}
{"text":"Cute place with some fabulous desserts. Everything looked so good it was hard to decide what to get. I ended up going with the ugly cookie which was so good and not overly sweet. I tried a bite of my husband's Monona bar which was good but super sweet. My mom had the mint sandwich cookie that would have been even better with some ice cream. 

Great addition to the Atwood area and fun place to stop for an afternoon break."}
{"text":"One of our friend had recommended Chocolaterian Cafe and it  had one of the best hot chocolate which is much much needed in Wisconsin Winter. How did i forget to write a review for one of my favorite dessert place. Hot chocolate and dessert here looked really amazing. 

Another thing i tried was Classy \"Ugly Cookie\" yes the name sounds crazy but after eating it i went crazy too it was so rich in flavor with awesome filling inside the cookie was simply heaven. I loved Ugly Cookie a lot and i would say any one visiting Chocolaterian Cafe must have at least one Ugly cookie in their plate. The service was really very good, the girls at the counter were very sweet and the pricing is not expensive at all. This place has no specific parking so you would need to park it on the street. A must visit place !!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here before in my last few years in Madison. And then, I was enlightened that it only opened in the past year! woohoo. Such a delight. I have to say, Madison really doesn't have many dessert shops for after dinner. 

So tada, here's an awesome one to fill in the gap!!! hurray :)

You walk in to be greeted by awesome friendly staff. They are so nice and helpful but yet don't overwhelm you while you're in awe and salivating over the endless choices. Go ahead, ask them anything. And so nice of them to give you some space after explaining the basics. 

It's really spacious, so you don't get overcrowded. very nice place to chill out with friends. Or maybe even for some games! 

I haven't had anything disappointing here. all were fantastic! You have to try the hot chocolate - it's more like pure chocolate gold. fudge. mmmmm. and it's more bitter chocolate, so don't worry about it being too sweet. Still, it's really rich, so it's good to share with someone. Ugly cookie was awesome. I also really liked the macaroons. PB&J macaroons!!! Loves. Fruit tarts - mm mm mmmmm. so fresh and light and lalalalala, makes me so happy!

This is a happy place. I thought Ella's deli was all we had (which doesn't have much tasty bits, and only has awesome things to play with) but YAY Chocolaterian is here to save the dayyyyy."}
{"text":"This place is great. They serve coffee, sandwiches, and salad, plus deserts. I think their branding is a little off and fear it may dissuade customers. For the longest time, I thought it was a chocolate shop because of the \"chocolaterian\" name, and I avoided it because I'm trying to cut down drastically on sweets!!"}
{"text":"Everything is great!  The chocolate mouse and the Parisian hot chocolate are the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"UGLY COOKIES! 

This is by far one of my favorite dessert places in Madison. They serve a large assortment of sweets, espresso, and wine. Its a great place to grab some treats to go or sit for a while. No matter which I choose I always end up taking some home. They \"ugly cookies\" are amazing. Other favorites include the Monona bar and macaroons. I have really enjoyed everything I have tried. If you are in the area make sure you stop in for a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Received gift certificate and stopped in today to acquire some NYE 2015 treats. Although the store was not busy, literally no one else at the counter, the hostess was VERY impatient and seemed irritated we wanted to look at the selections . I mentioned we had a gift certificate and would be choosing a few items. She still seemed determined to get us out of the store and be done with us. After selecting a few items, she packed them in a box, informed us that \"these fit perfectly in the box\" and closed it. Then waited expectantly at the register. Fine! We are done! Still no one else at the counter but we were not feeling welcome and gave up. Sadly the things we did choose were mediocre, the turtle and raspberry tarte thing. Praline and lemon tarte were good. Customer service and ambiance are key to a specialty shop. I think I'll stick with Gail Ambrosia. They don't seem irritated with customers and a better chocolate. Won't even bother using the rest of our gift certificate. Maybe that's their strategy."}
{"text":"I wanted a hot chocolate so I asked the server what made the Parisian Hot Chocolate \"Parisian.\" He said it was hard to explain but that it would be different than any hot chocolate I'd ever had before. I ordered it and paid was shocked to be served a tiny little espresso cup.  I was not happy to have paid so much (close to $5 if I recall correctly). But I tasted it and it was like liquid chocolate syrup, very good and super rich. I enjoyed it but thought the server was a bit insincere by claiming he couldn't describe it.  I think he just knew I wouldn't order it if he described it accurately.  Worth having once, not sure if I'll ever order it again, though.  And I'll go someplace else if I'm looking for a traditional hot chocolate."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Madison, we stumbled upon the Chocolaterian Cafe and had a wonderful experience.  From start to finish, the service was outstanding and we were made to feel at home instantly.   

Our family split a few of their delicious treats, but one that stood out was the \"Ugly Cookie\" which was comprised of chocolate chips, cocoa nibs, pistachios and \"Christine's gourmet toffee.  To do it over again, I would have picked up a dozen to take home.  

The atmosphere at the Chocolaterian is very mellow and inviting, with comfy seating throughout.  There is also a window which you can peek into the \"behind the scenes\" workings of the chocolate shop and view the chocolate artists work their magic.  
I would also like to thank one of the folks there for bringing out samples for our two girls.  That made there day!  

I should note that I appreciated the window displays on both sides of the shop.   It was nice to have a variety of fresh herbs and fruit in the window.   A very nice touch!  

All in all, a wonderful experience.   Putting my money where my mouth is, I do like to support local businesses.   While I don't live in Madison, I would highly recommend this gem to anyone whether you live in this fun area or are just stopping through."}
{"text":"At 9pm on a Saturday, it was lovely to see this place filled with intergenerational diversity: young and older couples, groups of friends, and families with young children and their teens. 

The Chocolaterian Cafe is a cozy place with \"that sounds perfect\" dessert options like the lemon tart or flourless chocolate cake. It's good for an after-dinner stopover when the dessert menu at the restaurant you were at didn't cut it. Also, as one would hope and expect, they seem to have plenty of gift options for the chocolate lover in your life. 

We tried the Parisian hot chocolate after hearing a rave recommendation, and it really was like drinking a truffle - smooth, velvety, dark. While it tasted like good quality chocolate, it a tad too much for me, like drinking syrup. I finished half of the tiny cup in store and took the rest home in an adorable mini takeaway container and had it in my coffee the next morning. Yum! 

This is a unique find in Madison and I would recommend it, if just to try their treats. If the parking lot is full, there's another one across the street. Also, a heads up for card-carrying folks, there's a sign asking you to pay in cash if the bill's under $20."}
{"text":"Drove to Chocolaterian from Milwaukee, in the snow, at night JUST FOR THE PARISIAN HOT CHOCOLATE AND AN UGLY COOKIE!  100% sure I'll do it again.

Chocolaterian's hot chocolate is made with 80% chocolate and 20% milk. It will rock your world. And I guess beauty really is in the eye of the beholder because, to me, ugly cookies look just fine.  TRY THEM!"}
{"text":"I'm giving the Chocolaterian 3 stars today, not for their chocolate, but for their internet connection. Typically maddeningly slow, it was unusable last Tuesday.  The barista on duty had no explanation. I like to hang out at the Chocolaterian while waiting for my daughter to finish a music lesson in the neighborhood so I can sample some delicious treats while having some down time - but I'm going to have to reevaluate this going forward. Reliable Wifi is an absolute necessity in a coffee shop/cafe and to many people it's just as important as the food."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a dessert fix and was pleased to find a great treat. The flour less chocolate peppermint cookie is incredible. Mostly chocolate, but the right sized peppermint makes it taste like a chocolate dipped candy cane.  A dense slice of heaven"}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! Awesome food, awesome coffee and even more awesome desserts! 
Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The space is big, cozy and wonderful. I love popping by here after a photo shoot and getting a non-vegan chocolate tart and a glass of vino. The staff is helpful and friendly. I'd love to see more vegan deserts, but all the things are sooo good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place, it was a finishing touch to a pizza contest.  We had a tasty coffee and a brownie to go."}
{"text":"My oldest daughter held a bridal shower for my youngest daughter here on Saturday. The space was wonderful. The platters of gooey-delightful-deliciousness were out of this world. Leanne and Kimberly were extremely accommodating.  I think her guests were a little unsure of this place for a shower venue beforehand,  but all walked away pleased and amazed. The treats I had had personally were the lemon tart and the ugly cookie. I would recommend both. Lots and lots of both!   I am anxious to go back. We could not have had a better experience."}
{"text":"This is such a lovely cafe.  They have AMAZING baked goods and excellent coffee and tea choices.  Plenty of seating room as well."}
{"text":"Warning: this review is part of my continuing search for a good coffee shop in which to write, wifi, and think.  The coffee, cookies and sweets are super-yummy.  But it is dark.  It is dank.  Why they ever picked that color for a room with not much light from outdoors is beyond me.  As the Isthmus wrote in their review: \"While the build-out is attractive, fluorescent lighting casts a ghoulish dead glow over both faces and food.\"  Pretty much."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite coffee shop in Madison. To the east of the capitol is this gem and adorable neighborhood. I met one of my girlfriends here for a catch up session and had found it through searching on yelp, so thanks yelpers!

Street parking was super easy to find and there was even a parking lot right next to the Cafe that was designated for patrons. We walked in and not only was the smell of fresh coffee and spices in the air, but there was also the lovely sounds of very cute man singing in the back, guitar in hand. To the right was the bakery display case and goodness was it hard to resist everything, so I settled upon two things. I got a Chai Latte, lime square, and the ugly cookie. We sat towards the music and settled in. I took an immediate bite into my lime square and BOOM. fantastic flavors of lime, cream, citrus, and goodness all shot into my mouth. I didn't even get a chance to share it with my friend because it was so delicious. 

My Chai latte was brought to the table and it was delish. What really made it stand out was how great they had made the foam to top it off. it wasn't any of this small millimeter of foam, but actually thick puffy and cloudy foam that you could eat with a spoon. The ugly cookie on the side was the perfect accompaniment. I would recommend if you like nuts, which i do, so i loved it.  Overall this place was a gem. From the music to the furniture to the smells all mixing together, I will definitely be back!

Happy coffee dating!"}
{"text":"We left a very loud restaurant after having dinner and wanted a little quieter atmosphere and dessert with coffee.    We found it here! 
Everything chocolate is very yummy here so glad we tried it! We will come back to try the fondu!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great hot chocolate to warm yourself up, this is the place. The hot chocolate is rich and sweet but not overly so. Just enough to make you want to have a shortbread cookie or something to enjoy with it. They have a nice selection of chocolates and other desserts for when that is your craving. We've gotten some of these chocolates as presents and people have always enjoyed the treats.

I also like that there are tables that let you look through the window into their chocolate/dessert making process. Overall, this is a pretty relaxing place to get a few hours of work in. They do serve coffee here but I was not terribly impressed with their brewed coffee."}
{"text":"This is not a place where I will be a frequent visitor. It's a bit out of the way, and well, who can afford (in terms of body, not money) to eat amazing chocolate that often. I am definitely glad that this place exists, and will come by again when I am willing to re-indulge on that amazing Parisian Hot Chocolate. It's extremely \"decadent\" as the barista warned, as was the chocolate cake we got. 

The hot chocolate was by far the best I've had in the area - the others I can think of are Kilwins and Pig in a Fur Coat; both decent but both have nothing on this one."}
{"text":"We only stopped in for chocolate goodies, so my review does not include food. The chocolates were very good, and decent value. But Ga** ****osius and DB ****sion both have superior chocolates in Madison, though they don't serve food. Parking at Chocolaterian was difficult though."}
{"text":"I wish that I could snap my fingers and instantly replace every Starbucks in Madison with a Chocolaterian Cafe. Oh, that would be heaven. Ugly Cookies for everyone!

Everything that I've consumed at Chocolaterian has been fantastic. The coffee drinks, quiche, baked goods, chocolatey concoctions - it's all just fantastically delicious. The Ugly Cookie is the star, though. Best. Cookie. Ever.

This most recent visit, I had a chicken panini and some tomato bisque, and both were exactly what I wanted. Delicious. I've tried several of their soups on different visits, and they are usually excellent.

It's a nice cozy place over on Atwood. The perfect place to sit and read or do some work...or relax. And if you sit near the back, you can watch them make stuff in the kitchen. 

I have not visited the Chocolaterian that's located in the downtown library, but intend on doing so soon. Like, right now."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about the Chocolaterian! The treats and coffee are decadent. But what I was most impressed with was their service. I held a bridal shower in the cafe on a Saturday afternoon, a very busy time for them. The owners and waitstaff could not have been more accommodating. 

The entire set up (tables, chairs, wine glasses,dessert plates) was very classy. The cafe was a beautiful venue for my event, and the staff was wonderful to work with. 

Ps. Their Ugly Cookie has ruined me from other cookies."}
{"text":"Love this cafe!  Everything I've had there is great!  Today's galette (mushroom, potato & onion) was especially tasty. Very much what I wanted on a lovely day...

But what made today a really memorable visit, was hearing the proprietresses working with a translator to help a valued employee for whom English is a second language. This shows such compassion and valuing their employees... I was really touched. Not only does the attention to detail go into their lovely food and baked goods, but into tenderly caring for those with whom they work. That makes me love Chocolaterian that much more!  We all should definitely be supporting a local business like this one!"}
{"text":"The Chocolaterian is the real deal, there are desserts you can only imagine. The chocolate is dark and luscious.  My favorite desserts are the smore's, bucky bait and the fresh fruity macarons.   Coffee is always served promptly and politely.  The space is warm and inviting making me feel like I am Harry Potter at the Three Broomsticks  There is a peek through window you can look through to watch workers make their luscious desserts.   I hear the Parisian hot chocolate is the best, I'll be back soon to try it!  I am looking forward to that!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place for coffee/dessert. This place was definitely a lot bigger inside than it looked. If you have a sweet tooth, this is the place to go! There were so many choices of desserts to choose from. 

We ended up going with the chocolate mint cookie sandwich that had the mint chocolate filling in the middle of the cookie and the fruit tart with the mango filling in the inside and omg YUMMM! I'm not the biggest fan of fruit tarts but this one was an exception. The mango was what did it for me and was sooooo GOOD! Excellent choice with the mango to put in the fruit tarts! 

Something as simple as a chocolate covered pretzel was just awesome. The chocolate they use has just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"Went in for a chocolate fix.   Ended up with $60 worth of yumminess. I bought two tins of the toffee, a lemon tart, a peanut butter chocolate caramel treat, and a bag of chocolate roasted whole bean coffee.  Gave one of the tins and the tart to my son....they didn't last the night so, apparently they must have been good. I am trying not to break into the other tin as it is a gift for someone at home...wish me luck . This is worth a stop for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Best coffee I've ever had. And the desserts were wonderful! The people that work there are very friendly. We don't live here but if we come threw we will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I frequent the Atwood neighborhood, and finally tried this place out a couple of weeks ago. I had been wanting to try it for so long! It was well worth the wait, and I think I'm going to become a regular. 

The staff is so friendly and engaging. It's so wonderful to walk into a cafe or restaurant and have the staff make eye contact with a smile, let alone have a full on conversation with you. In my experience it is so rare to have a 100% pleasant experience. I've been there multiple times at this point and each time I'm greeted with a new friendly face. 

The Ugly Cookie is to die for. It's my new go-to when I need something ultra sweet. The mixture of all the different flavors really bring me back to being a little kid when my mom would make toffee for Christmas. I have yet to explore the rest of the menu but I know I won't be let down."}
{"text":"Stellar. Great environment - casual & quiet. Even the kids at the table behind me were well-behaved. The baristas were smiley and charming, the decor was on point, and the eats oh man.

Their European style hot chocolate is to die for. But beware, its size is deceiving and you may want to start by splitting one with a friend! I last had chocolate like this in Spain, and while I was seriously craving some churros to dunk, their sweets more than scratched that itch. I recommend the shortbread since you'll definitely need something dunkable, and it's a perfect vehicle for the chocolate. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the other sweet we got, but it was delicious!

When I go back (soon!) I'll have to try an Ugly Cookie or the Badger Bait... but this time I'm not sharing my hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Love to come here to cap the evening with a plate of chocolate and a smooth Malbec. Perfect date night spot. Cozy booths and tables. Delicious chocolate. What more could a girl want?"}
{"text":"So disappointed at the staff!!!  We stopped in at 9:46pm on Friday night( shop closes at 9:30) but there was still customers inside!  We made a special drive just to satisfy our macaroon cravings to not being satisfy at all .  Staff said, we are done, closed sorry.  How hard is it to grab some macaroons from the display case and put it in the bag and ring us out and make the sale!?  Seriously!!"}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. The Parisian hot chocolate is to die for. We also had the ugly cookie, the badger bait, and the chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"Which of the many times shall I write about? Doesn't matter, that's the point! The Chocolaterian is walking distance from my house so I find myself headed there when a) I have a sweet tooth, b) I'm cold and need a shot of french hot chocolate or c) need to get out of the house to study. This place provides the sweets, chocolate and space for all three. Love the WiFi, comfy couches, interesting decorations and art. This is my local cafe - and I love it."}
{"text":"I live for the chocolate tarts! Excellent coffee and very laid-back atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"One of the best cafes in Madison. Good desserts, quiche, coffee, and sandwiches. 

Also happens to be a large cafe with lots of places to sit. Recommended and welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My first trip to Chocolaterian Cafe came a week ago after a very disappointing visit to a nearby restaurant for dinner. While the desserts there has *sounded* good, the dinner wasn't, so my companion and I chose to walk to Chocolaterian. The day had been drizzly and overcast, so I was looking forward to a cozy setting and a warm beverage. Chocolaterian delivered on both counts. There was plenty of space, and the tables weren't crowded together. There were several big windows on two of the restaurant's walls, which let in a nice amount of natural light. The baking cases, tables, and floors were all well-cleaned, and the surroundings did a good job of dampening any noise. The bathroom was clean and well-stocked. The woman behind the counter gave us some recommendations, and also pointed out the half-priced dessert case in case we wanted to keep our visit frugal. The lower prices were a plus; some items do seem overpriced (though given the butter prices lately, it's understandable). We chose a caramel tart and a chocolate-raspberry tart to share, and I ordered a piping hot cup of mint tea.

The caramel tart was delicious, although the crust was a bit tough and slightly thick where the sides met the bottom. The caramel was gooey without being a mess, and the cashews on top provided a salty richness that I always welcome when eating caramel. My companion, not usually a fan of caramel, stole more bites than I thought he would. His chocolate-raspberry tart was still moist and delicious, despite it being half-priced. The raspberry flavor was very well-incorporated, and added a nice hint of acidity to even out the richness of the chocolate. It also didn't taste artificial or too much like raspberry preserves, which was a welcome change from what usually happens when I order something with raspberry flavor. The tea was fantastic as well, hot and flavorful. It needed no added sugar and was very welcome given the weather outside. I look forward to returning, and trying some of their new savory items!"}
{"text":"The Parisian hot chocolate!! Liquid, thick, fudgey, served in a mug and possibly the best thing ever created for taste buds. It doesn't stop with the best hot chocolate ever created, there's more! It is a chocolate lover's dream come true, and it's quaint, classy, housing more than just chocolate but who cares about that! 

This is the cafe you go to after dinner and after the show, where you go when you're not quite ready to call it a night, where you host friends from out of town for dessert - where you stop in for your fix of the fudgey:

Flourless chocolate cake, dense and decadent
The shortbread cookies dipped in chocolate
Chocolate almond horns
Brownies
Chocolate tart
Thick and chewy chocolate chip cookies

And yes they serve lemon tarts and macaroons, soups, paninis, quiche, caffeine and even wine. 

I love this dessert cafe, it focuses on the chocolate side of treats, and does it well. We needed a place like Chocolaterian in Madison. Having only opened in October 2012, I think they have quickly found their place in the community."}
{"text":"It has quality chocolate, so there's four stars. They also have a few entrees but really it's a dessert spot. There's nothing wrong with that either. IMO check out other restaurants around Willy for dinner then stop here for a great finishing touch."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick bite to eat, hang out, or have an informal meeting.  Their Ugly Cookies are phenomenal!  I had a quick bite to eat there today:  the Italian Panini was fantastic, the Carrot Ginger soup was not-pretty bland and watery.  

The Parisian Hot Chocolate is worth a try, if you need a chocolate fix.  The servers are hit or miss, but if you just want treat like a cookie, quiche, or panini, it's a great place to stop."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the cafe and I was pleasantly surprised. It was open, airy and comfortable. We came in late (around 8:30). I ordered the mousse (small) and a chocolate chip cookie. I went simple because doing simple well can be difficult to do. 

The cookie was good. It was tasty without being too chocolatey. Now the mousse on the other hand was PHENOMENAL!  I mean light, airy and rich in flavor. You could actually see the air bubbles in the mousses it was so fluffy. 

I ordered coffee as well. It was delicious. And now I understand that they were closing at nine, but the manager pulled the coffee at 8:45.  I wish I could have gotten a freshen up or a to-go cup for my coffee since it is bottomless.

Otherwise, Hunter (the GM) was cordial, informative and friendly.  This is a GREAT date place or a place to get a little treat with friends."}
{"text":"I couldn't help but give into my gluttonous indulgences, but I think that's kinda the point here, lol. At Chocolaterian Cafe, 'tis ALWAYS the season to treat yourself. The atmosphere absolutely seethes with decadence! Lose yourself in the heavenly smells and sights like I did, and I'm positive you won't be disappointed! 

A special thank you to the guy who warned me that they make all their chocolates with heavy cream - so clutch! Good thing I had my lactaid pills with me :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! 

The service is great. Super accommodating. 

I came in just before close and was craving some Parisian hot chocolate, unfortunately for me they were out (except the little bit left in the bottom of the container they store it in). The front employee was simply amazing hooking me up with the last little bit he could get out of the pump on the house. 
It's the little things that just make your day! Thanks Hunter---a wonderful Chocolaterian employee!

My favorite is the Ugly cookie. It's full of caramel and pistachios, soft and chewy. Yum. Nothing more to say about this. Yum says it all.

Badger bait is another great choice (the peanut butter one)! It's like a 1/2 brownie fudgy goodness with whipped peanut butter on top of it all wrapped in chocolate tastiness. 

The mouse is fantastic too. It takes me back to a week I spent in Paris eating chocolate mouse for like dessert every night. Again, YUM!

I enjoy they have a parking lot so that everyone who does not live in the Atwood area can also come visit the Chocolaterian Café and get their chocolate fix. 

Lots of great comfy seating options! Couches, chairs, pillows. 
A great spot to finish up date night at or just to have a little taste of heaven."}
{"text":"This is totally a dessert lover's stop-in- [at least]- three-times-a-week kinda place. Good options (although I don't think they change it up that often), easy seating for a chill experience, and even a band on Friday evenings! The ugly cookie is definitely the star here, with melt-in-your-mouth toffee and crunchy pistachios, so get one to eat and at least 3 to go :) Weirdly, the ice cold lemon water was one of my favorite parts of the experience. It goes well with chocolate thingies! See you soon, Chocolatarian."}
{"text":"Free and fast wi-fi.  Friendly staff.  Delicious house made menu items.  Atmosphere is cozy and perfect for getting some work done or chatting with friends.  I only gave 4 stars because the temperature inside was a bit too chilly but I'm from Texas so, maybe i'm just not used to it.  Still, a fireplace would kick this place up a knotch on my list."}
{"text":"Classy meets down home goodness for a happy marriage at the Chocolatarian. This is true for the good food, the good-hearted staff, and the good feelings you get when the oxytocin busts out because...you know, everything I just said.

A big group of us settled in here before a show at the Barrymore down the street. As we stood in line to order at the counter next to the dessert case, I got a sugar rush just oggling the array of choices to top off my main dish. I don't think the chocolate mousse could feel my lust as I passed by, but I'm pretty sure the smores and the lemon tart were on to me! 

For starters our group went with the grilled chicken curry salad, the Cuban panini, duck fat fries, an asparagus-spinach-swiss quiche, a savory galette, and a carmelized onion and goat cheese tart. The chicken salad was moist, and a nice balance of salty and sweet curry. I didn't try the Cuban but it was popular... Several folks at our table scarfed them down. Duck fat home fries are super tasty and a little rich-plan to split an order with friends. The quiche, omg, the quiche...The goat cheese tart tasted more sweet than savory-a nice surprise. We had fun at our table swapping tastes of \"a little of this for a little of that\", because everything was good. Also, most if not all dishes came with a side salad of mixed greens lightly dressed with a spicy, just-a-hint-of-tang vinaigrette. This salad is da bomb.

Service was courteous and quick. For a night before a show, they were pretty busy, but kept it friendly and kept it moving. You order at the counter and they give you a number to take to your table. The dishes kept streaming out of the kitchen and we all got fat and happy before our show. 

They're smart with portion sizes here...the food here is light enough to save room for dessert, or not. But of course, it IS the Chocolatarian, so then we all got fat and happy AGAIN when we ordered up desserts. Favorites were the chocolate mousse, ugly cookie, and Expresso with a side of candied orange rind and a line square. Mousse is delectable chocolaty moussiness; creamy and smooth and dotted with mini malted chocolates. Ugly cookie is so amazing you don't care what it looks like; I'd get one for here and a few to-go.

Would I return again? Absolutely. And I'd bring my friends, my honey, mother, father, sisters, and brothers. Because this place knows how to treat you like family."}
{"text":"For me, going to The Chocolaterian Café is a treat on pretty much every level - it peaks all of my senses. It's like being transported to a different time and place. I love it! I love the décor, the open area where you can watch the chocolaty magic happen, the wonderful customer service, the music, the cavernous booths, the array of delicious choices - I love it all!!! I'll break it down a bit so I can give you some useful, yummy specifics.

My first visit involved the Parisian hot chocolate and it's like nothing I've ever experienced. I find it difficult to describe, but I can promise you that it's worth it. It comes in this slender, white mug full of melty goodness that's reminiscent of chocolate ganache, but just a bit darker. A little goes a long way and the spoon........um, you guys, it's cutest spoon on the planet - totally adding to the charm factor.

My second visit involved tea and that was lovely and flavorful - very tea-like. But my third visit, OMG! I had the chocolate mousse and it was incredible - perfect, in fact! It's light as air and not overly sweet with these little crisp chocolate balls sprinkled on top. And at the bottom.........a dark, rich layer of ganache to finish it off. Perfection! I will be having it again. You can be sure of that.

I still want to try their chocolate chip cookie, their version of a giant Oreo and the quiche, but there's time. I'll get back to you on those. Oh AND they carry locally made Christine's caramels & toffee! Major bonus!!! Just sayin'.
Thank you, Chocolaterian!!!!"}
{"text":"Scouring through google for our next sweet spot landed us here despite the bone chilling cold (Chocolate can you make you do strange things!!) The place is a cute mishmash of a cafe and a bakery and thankfully one of the few good ones that stays open late! (Are you listening other bakeries!?)

We ogled at all but settled at their Chocolate Tart and Passion Fruit Tart. The Chocolate tart had a nice balance of dense semi \"dark\" chocolate custard paired with a lighter creamier chocolate buttercream frosting. You might love it a lot or not so much based on how you handle a mildly dark/bitter chocolate taste.

The better of the two by a good stretch was the fruit tart. Yes in this case, fruit did beat chocolate!! The passion fruit custard was light, perfectly sweet and tarty. The shortbread crust held very well and the \"fresh\" oranges on top were perfect companions to the overall dish. A very well made tart indeed.

The prices here are a bit on the upper end, $7 each tart, but the portioning was generous and taste elegant which makes this place a must for sweet lovers!"}
{"text":"If I could only choose one cookie to enjoy for the rest of my life, it would be the Ugly Cookie from Chocolaterian Cafe. Chocolate pieces + pistachios + TOFFEE + other very important ingredients = pure bliss. I dream about the Ugly Cookie, and it's perfect balance of flavors. This alone is reason to visit Chocolaterian. 

This past weekend; however, they added another level of excellence by introducing Cadence Cold Brew coffee on Nitro tap. They offer growler fills and standard size pours. The sample I enjoyed was exactly what a nitro tap should be: creamy and bursting with flavor. I will definitely return for Cadence Cold Brew, among other offerings!"}
{"text":"Hands down best chocolate mousse I've ever had in my life. Also the Koign Amann is the best pastry of all time and they do it RIGHT!"}
{"text":"Delicious dessert and cold brew! Great service, with a knowledgeable person behind the counter."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit location in Madison for any chocolate lover! The atmosphere is relaxing & friendly. We tried the Parisian Hot Chocolate, which is a must try, and a raspberry tart. We took home an ugly cookie. All of which were amazing & I would get again. The non dessert items looked tasty as well. I want to go back for lunch to try it out (and to get more hot chocolate)."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this gem in Atwood. I loved the passion fruit tart and the salted caramel truffle. Holy smokes. I was in chocolate heaven.

I honestly had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try. There are so many choices and everything looked amazing. There is even an opportunity to do fondue. 

My friends all picked different things and they liked everything. I am definitely coming back again and will be a regular. Service was excellent! Please tip! 

Self serve for water and make sure you clear your own table. :)"}
{"text":"By some weird turn of events that makes no sense considering my love of chocolate, baked goods, and pretty much all things sweet, I've been in Chocolaterian on a couple of occasions but had never sampled any of their fine, chocolatey goods. I don't get it either.

I finally changed that on a Saturday evening following an early-ish dinner at Tex Tubb's. While walking past I saw that Chocolaterian was still open so I dragged my boyfriend inside. After much hemming and hawing, I decided to try the Ugly Cookie on recommendation of practically everyone and the Badger Bait. 

The Ugly Cookie was fantastic. Based on the ingredients and its thin, crispy nature I wasn't completely sold but the rave reviews convinced me to give it a chance. Comprising chocolate chips, cocoa nibs, oats, pistachios, and toffee, it has a lot of things I like individually but wasn't sure if I'd like together. Turns out, I do. Try it. Just do it. The majority is definitely right on this one.

The Badger Bait was disappointing. It's listed as a brownie topped with chocolate buttercream and ganache. The brownie was crunchy, which is not what I was expecting. If I had had to guess, I would have thought it was biscotti. I also would have thought the topping was chocolate whipped cream - it was very light for a buttercream. While it isn't what I think of as buttercream, it was delicious and probably the best part. The ganache coating didn't really add much to the overall flavor but did make it look nice. For the size (two to three bites) I didn't think the price ($2.50) aligned with the product either. I have paid ridiculous amounts of money for pretty bakery items before, so it's not just a reaction of \"gee whiz, that's a lot for what you get! I could get a two brownies at the grocery store for that!\"

With that said, the prices are on the higher end at Chocolaterian. If you, like me, have an appreciation for the finer sweets in life, it's probably not a surprise or a problem for you. If you're just looking satiate your sweet tooth, there might be some sticker shock.

I'm definitely going to have to work from here one afternoon and enjoy some of the Parisian sipping chocolate - that sounds right up my alley."}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to try this place out? It better not take me years to get back! This place is so cute. Little nooks to sit in with pillows, chocolate drinks and tarts. You can't go wrong. We got the fondue which was a great idea. Tho I suggest also grabbing a spoon! We lost many a raspberry to the delicious pot. The fondue comes with marsh mellows, pound cake, pretzels, strawberries, bananas, and raspberries. All were perfect! 
I need to go back to try s raspberry chocolate tart. They look so perfect in the case but fondue won out. 
Any chocolate lover will enjoy a trip to this little cafe."}
{"text":"The Parisian Hot Chocolate is like drinking hot molten ganache with a variety of chocolate ingredients.  Outstanding drink.  Makes me want to write RSVP at Bon Appetit for the recipe.  You think it's not very much to drink, but its richness means that when you're finished with the cup, you are very satiated.  Had it once just after opening time, and it wasn't very hot yet.  I like it better when it's hot.

Not a big fan of the lime meltaways -- I don't think they can decide if they're a candy or a lemon-bar-type thing.

But anything chocolate?  I doubt you can go wrong."}
{"text":"We got the Monona Bar and Lemon Tart with some drop coffee -- delicious! Great way to start or end a date night!"}
{"text":"PROS: Cute date spot, large selection of desserts
CONS: Heavy desserts, slightly pricey

We tried a selection of treats, including a cream puff, chocolate mousse, and fruit tart. The quality of the desserts is higher than average, but they are also sweeter, larger, and denser than expected for fine pastry. The first couple of bites were heavenly, but became a bit nauseating toward the end. If you have a low sugar tolerance, try to split one dessert between 2 people, rather than getting multiple desserts per person, as we greedily and unwisely chose to do."}
{"text":"I don't really have much of a sweet tooth, but I come here once a month for my book club, which you should totally join because it's awesome (Salad Days Book Club, check out a book club book at Hawthorne or Pinney Library!) It's fun watching the pastry chefs crank out batches of goodies behind that giant glass window that looks into the kitchen, and it's also fun ogling the fancy desserts in the case by the register. I've heard the hot chocolate is to die for, but have not yet verified. The mint tea though, I can vouch for. It is not like your other ordinary mint teas. This mint tea takes it to the next level. Too bad they close early, otherwise I would study here all the time."}
{"text":"Parisian hot chocolate. The best in town!
I'll be back for it. 
Very nice place and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee/dessert joint in the area! Staff is always friendly and the ugly cookies are the best thing in the world."}
{"text":"Nice place and seating areas. I tried the dipping melted chocolate and was great! The Parisian hot chocolate was really good as well. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My oh my! I love Chocolaterian. I went for a chocolate and wine pairing last night with a friend. Star Liquor did the pairing and he did a wonderful job. 

My office is close by so I have tried a wide sampling of their products. My two favorite are the Badger Bait and the Quiche. 

Chocolaterian has a wonderful low key atmosphere however you can taste their passion for everything they create. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. 

Oh and try their Parisien Hot Chocolate, I promise you will be compelled to go back the next day for another one."}
{"text":"Overall, I'm not impressed with the selections. I was just expecting more options, from what I have heard from other people. Don't get me wrong, it was good. A friend and I shared the chocolate torte. Chocolate shortbread and ganache?! Yeah, you can't really go wrong. My friend got the bottomless tea, and the presentation was adorable...you get a whole little fat teapot all to yourself! I ended up leaving with a few Badger Baits (Bites? I can't remember) to take to some employees (#bestbossever) and they really enjoyed them. This would definitely be a fun place to go for a date night...something small and sweet with wine; if he is as asshole, hey, you still got chocolate."}
{"text":"I can't get over how nice the staff is here!! Also one time sassy cow was partnering with them to give out free sundaes, so that was a happy day. 

I've only tried a few things but everything has been very good. Definitely recommend getting the chocolate mousse to split with a friend. It's AWESOME, but too decadent to have by yourself (others may disagree). Ask for a sample of the Parisian hot chocolate before you order something else, also very decadent but lovely for a taste! They also have a nice selection of sandwiches and other cafe items.

I went on a Friday and they had live music playing which made the whole thing even lovelier!"}
{"text":"Traveling to Madison from Chicago, we had finished our meal at another restaurant and were not tempted by their offerings.

Fortunately, we found Chocolaterian for some tasty treats.  

I had the Ugly Cookie--perfect crunch, sweetness and bits of chocolate.

My partner began by storing up for the trip back and home, ordering the flourless chocolate cake (quite dense and good on the first bite) and a few chocolate coconut mint candies.  

My partner took her first nibble of the mint candy and started in on reallocating.  

The cake was relegated to a later and the candy was a now.  I cannot report on how these candies tasted--I was not allowed a taste despite asking.  As I worried about such concepts as intervention and improper hoarding, we headed back for home, pleased, having found a very delightful café.  
  
p.s.  I'm 5 starring it although the latte is not at the same level as everything else we tried."}
{"text":"I had the manona, flourless choc  cookie,  ugly cookie, and a pecan praline.  ...ok...not all at once, but over the course of an evening and next day.  All delicious.  If I live in the area, I would definitely be back to this place to try out everything else. Certainly doesn't hurt that you can get wine and beer there as well!"}
{"text":"Everything you could dream chocolate and then some ....tasty samples....too delicious coffee, a super cute and comfy book nook with pillows you can just disappear into...I could go on and on; Just go...you won't be disappointed. 
Macaroons in six colors,"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite place for desserts. They have plenty of pastries, always have tons of macaron flavors and delicious coffee drinks!"}
{"text":"Watcha doing tomorrow? 
Go get a cookie. 
Or a truffle. 
Or a tart. 
Or fondue. 
Or a slice of a yule log. 
Or a cheese plate.
Or pretty much anything these guys are dishing up. 
Bomb. 
Dot. 
Com."}
{"text":"What's the intention when visiting a place called Chocolaterian?  To get something made with chocolate.....duh.  In my case, this review is based solely on my lunch experience.  I'll let others chime in on the sweet goodies.  For any quiche fan, this is the place!  I don't know what they do, but the egg mixture is prepared with perfection.......it's not chewy tasting like most others, but rather melt in your mouth good!  As well, the food isn't over-seasoned and flavored - good for somebody like me who's slightly hypertensive. The portion size will be enough that you won't have room for dessert.  The \"mini\" quiche ran for $7 for my one with bacon.  They also offer other options as well.  Another great addition to Madison's awesome east side eating options!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot to take fellow chocoholics visiting from out of town.

I've been here 5-6 times now, and I've tried quite a few of their menu items. My favorites are the ugly cookie, the spicy chocolate cookie, the Parisian hot chocolate (dark, 6oz), and the peanut butter badger bait. I didn't really care for the chocolate mousse (too sweet) or the chocolate soda (too heavy and sort of a strange combination).

The savory items are also pretty tasty. I've shared the quiche, galette, and one of their paninis with friends, and they were all pretty good. The food is a bit heavy, but it's yummy and they use seasonal produce.

I highly recommend coming here for the hot chocolate if nothing else!"}
{"text":"Still love their chocolate creations, but I just paid almost 4 bux for a Red Eye?? Shiiiittt... I can get one for half that a block away."}
{"text":"Visits have been consistently underwhelming, while baked goods are consistently delicious.

Plusses: great location on Atwood, cozy interior, big window looking into kitchen so you can watch them work while you eat, ugly cookies.

Minuses: Service is inconsistent and food items leave something to be desired. Went by yesterday and got a delicious cup of chicken & dumpling soup served with a side of cold, overly-salted-to-the-point-of-being-inedible bread.  This is par for the course on every visit I've made, there's always something standing in the way of their greatness."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and I'm never disappointed. I had to write up a shout-out for the amazing fruit cup I had today. Blackberry, raspberry, and almond tiny little pie. It was such a delightful little treat. It was filling and satisfying, but I wouldn't say no to ... 5 more? ;)

Great atmosphere. Nice staff. Yay!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Friday night for desserts. We got an assortment of chocolate tarts and pastries that were generally very creative. The food was good (some of the options even very good), although the service left something to be desired. The server was almost rude as he reminded us that they closed in 12 minutes and that we'd have to take our food to go. He then told us that they would kick us out exactly at 9:30. I understand that they need to close up, but I can't think of any other establishment (food or even retail) that would actually ask a paying customer to leave at closing time. 

Would likely go back again as long as it's nowhere near closing time."}
{"text":"I love baking - but when it comes to making something as complex as a macaroon... Well, I don't have THAT much patience. The Chocolaterian is where I get my fix for macaroons. They have a variety of flavors to choose from - my favorites are the fruity ones. They also have such a variety of different sweets - there's something fit to whatever you're craving that day. Chocolates, tarts, truffles - the list just goes on. But the cherry on top is that there's a decent selection of wine to choose from too. 
Wine and dessert - that's pretty sweet."}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm in Madison, but today will be my last. Blank, unsmiling, too cool to care staff never heard of \"drinking chocolate,\" even though they have it as \"French hot chocolate\" (might want to educate your staff, \"chocolatiers,\" as it is referred to as drinking chocolate in most other parts of the world), and never said thank you, either for my purchase or the $1 I dropped in the tip jar.
In case you haven't noticed you've got competition pretty close by. I'll give them my business from now on. Great products, crap service."}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance and neighborhood café feeling that this place has-everyone appears very happy, friendly and in good spirits....chocolate will do that to you!  However, my husband and I went here on Friday because I've been craving their chocolate caramel tart for about 2 weeks now.  The tart really left something to be desired....the chocolate/caramel was delicious and creamy but the tart shell itself was bland and lacked any flavor.  The tart had cashews and some crushed up toffee on top that took away from the taste....the toffee just got so stuck in my teeth that I couldn't enjoy the tart.  I will be back but I will have to try something else because the chocolate caramel tart just lacked the decadent wow that I was hoping for!!"}
{"text":"The cute name attracted me to this place, so after dinner at Tex Tubbs, we walked across the street to check them out.  They had several vegan options in their case, each item labeled accordingly. Being that it was my first time, I asked one of the workers if there were any other vegan sweets aside from the ones labeled. She had the WORST attitude EVER. She made me so angry that I almost walked out. However, I decided to try the vegan chocolate covered pretzel sticks. (They were very good!) The young lady who was working the register was very nice and friendly. I asked if Ms. Attitude was a manager, to which she replied, no. I should've gotten her name so I could make sure that her behavior was addressed, but I left it alone. If I ever go back and Ms. Nasty Attitude is there, I'll be sure to get her name. hmph"}
{"text":"My favourite place to hangout in Madison..... LOVE to sit here and sip a cup of coffee while I work on my laptop....feels good to see people reading, working and  having a good conversation over lunch. The best part is you get to see those busy hands working in the kitchen making some mouth watering bakery stuff.... My personal favourite here is the Quiche (loved all the quiches that I tasted here) and the flourless chocolate cake with coffee."}
{"text":"Quality of chocolate is superb. This is a nice, relaxed cafe with a good variety of bakery items (most with chocolate) plus drinks like lattes or hot chocolate. We had a party of four and ordered a piece of flourless chocolate cake ($7), a peanut badger bait ($2.5), a chocolate mint square ($1), a like square ($1, no chocolate), and a sea salt caramel bite ($1). We love the intense flavors of the $1 bites and powerful chocolate flavor of everything with chocolate. All the items were very sweet. The flourless chocolate cake was rather monotonous and could have benefited from another flavor in addition to chocolate - vanilla, raspberry, or maybe even just flakes of chocolate. Overall, everything is really tasty, and it's hard to get better chocolate."}
{"text":"I have got to visit again! Lovely, spacious, cozy decor! Treats to die for (or drool over) behind glass cases. I chose a Parisian hot chocolate, which was deliciously rich, dark, chocolatey and smooth. Perfect to sip on, on a cold blustery afternoon when you need a little sugary pick me-up! I bought a couple items to take home, one being the Badger Bait with peanut butter. It was a delectable smaller size length of brownie topped with not too sweet peanut butter buttercream, and covered in a yummy chocolate ganache, topped with a peanut. Amazing! I must go back for lunch, because the warm soup and quiche smells coming from the kitchen were heavenly."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's the only coffee shop near my house with wi-fi that stays open late, and it's really good. So, usually, it's a total win-win experience. The only reason I docked it a couple of stars is due to the bummer service today. I come here often to work, and I ALWAYS pay with cash. Today, I had to give the last of my cash to my husband and son, who were going somewhere that was cash only. When I went to pay for the second item I'd bought today, I was scolded for paying with a card, by someone who appeared to be an owner, and told that they like to accept cash only for anything under $20 - but that she was making an exception this time. I apologized and said that I always pay with cash but that I was without this one time. She didn't acknowledge my apology. I always try to remain conscious of the fees local businesses have to pay by allowing for debit card payments, but sometimes I find myself without. This left a super bad taste in my mouth about a place that was formerly my saving grace. But I'll be back, I'm sure. Always with cash, of course, since I certainly can't afford to spend $20 on myself every time I work."}
{"text":"Not five star because the house coffee could have been more fresh, but it is house coffee. Vanilla latte and ugly cookie was great! Friendly service with bakery-side viewing and live piano this evening. Great stop after dinner!"}
{"text":"Love me some chocolate. 

Love me some Chocolaterian. 

Basicallyyy, this is a great space to study or just imbibe on liquid chocolate and feast on cake and cookies. Yes please.

Everything here looks so scrumptious that my chocolate decision-making capabilities are always shot. A flourless chocolate cookie or a slice of flourless chocolate cake. Ayyy how do you pick!!!! you can't. 

When it comes down to it, your only option is to tell the worker behind the counter that you have a problem and need outside intervention. They will choose for you. And it will be delicious."}
{"text":"A serenade to the Ugly Cookie:
 You are so beautiful
to me...
Can't you see?
You're everything I hope for,
you're everything I need."}
{"text":"Such a cute, cozy place to unwind and enjoy something sweet (great place for dessert!)! Great couches in the back, with magazines and board games. Badger bait is soo good. They have port and dessert wines too!!! Would definitely go back- perfect way to spend a cold wintery day!! The quiches looked amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for treats after dinner tonight with a group of friends. Just looking at the lovely items in the counter is a treat in and of itself, but you'll definitely want to pick something and savor every bite. We were a party of five, eager for a sweet after  a fine supper up the way.
I was so enchanted I forgot to take pics of the items I personally tasted, but the two I posted are from our visit. Definitely going back for one of those cashew caramel tarts. So pretty.
I became infatuated with their chocolate raspberry tart, and devoured one of those. It involves a thin, buttery shortbread tart shell given a thick glazing of concentrated raspberry sauce. Then there is a magical chocolate ganache-cum-mousse that gave that part of my brain that needs chocolate a strong, lingering, and not entirely platonic hug. There are other layers of chocolate whip increasing in lightness and a single fresh raspberry atop the mound.
You need to try pretty much anything. Their signature ugly cookie is enormous and is hemorrhaging caramel, chocolate chips, nuts, and all kinds of cookie add-in goodness. Get one to go and hide it from everyone else.
There is also a vegan menu, and continuing with cookies, they have the deepest, darkest chocolate and chile cookie I have ever. It's vegan.  Crunchy outside, chewy in, deep chocolate bliss rounded off with the heat of dried chiles. I can't decide if it's a mix or not, but a wild guess is something like cayenne or guajillo.
The shop is large, relaxed, and well-maintained. They serve light food as well. I've demanded that we go here any time we're in close proximity to it."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. It is beautiful inside and I wanted to try one of everything! I restrained myself and only tried 3 things; a molasses cookie, an ugly cookie and a lime meltaway. They were all stellar. Molasses cookies are my favorite cookies, so I have to try them when I see them. These did not disappoint. The Ugly Cookie is really a close second. Love the toffee and pistachios combination. The lime meltaway was a tiny square of yumminess that does melt in your mouth. Prices are good and the gentleman that waited on me could not have been more pleasant. I guess I will be making the drive to Atwood Ave. a little more often."}
{"text":"Like chocolate?  Like rich, creamy, perfectly crafted chocolate?  This is the place to go!  My team and I were in Madison on business and were looking for something sweet. We landed here just before closing on a cold, windy night and found chocolate nirvana. There were several of us and we must've had one of everything. It was chocolate nirvana!  It's a shame we had to head home. 

If you are in Madison, give them a visit to satisfy your sweet tooth, you'll be glad you did. (Get the Parisian drinking chocolate!!!!!)"}
{"text":"There is nothing to argue against this place. It has a great euro and cozy feel. It has wonderful baked goods, but it also serves some meals. I would say that it is a great place to go to study, but I always get a cocoa-high from the flourless chocolate cake. They also display local artists; I'd be a regular if I lived closer."}
{"text":"If you find yourself caught up for several months with nonstop concerts, work parties, and crunk nights on the WEST side of the capitol...... a surprise outing on a weekday night for coffee and chocolate may be just the thing you need. And if you're addicts like us... go for a cup of coffee paired with a coffee macaroon.

Be sure to stop by the front on your way out, to admire your date admiring the beautiful hand painted map of Madison."}
