{"text":"Consistently excellent meals. The staff really know what they're doing as well. The pita is in-house made, and very addictive! The dolmathes are something else, and the calamari is said to be the best in Calgary. My favourite dish is the \"Moskari or Arni Giouvetsi\" (get the lamb one!) For desert, the baklava is perfect (not too sweet)."}
{"text":"I'm staying at this hotel I bought breakfast to go from them this morning came back to ask for a plate to reheat my food and they said they couldn't. Way to treat your guest here"}
{"text":"I chose Pegasus based on the positive reviews but what a disappointment! The portions were tiny compared to what we're used to from Greek restaurants. Low marks for quantity and mediocre in terms of quality. Service was fine but on the slow side. The popularity of this place is inexplicable!"}
{"text":"Although the suites here are quite impressive in terms of size, there is one thing that seems strange to me: the upstairs bedroom in our suite has no door, and neither does its bathroom.  This stands in contrast with the downstairs bedroom, which has its own door, lots of space, and a door to its bathroom, with a shower and jacuzzi integrated into the main bedroom.  Although the fixtures appear to date back to the 1990s, they're still fine except for the aforementioned lack of doors for either the upstairs bedroom or upstairs bathroom.  This problem extends to the upstairs toilet, which has no door to separate it from either the rest of the bathroom or the rest of the suite.  Imagine if someone poops up there while someone else is eating downstairs! Until they get some doors, I will not be able to recommend this place despite its coziness and overall space. In addition, the restaurant could use more creative menu items."}
{"text":"Stayed here for 2 nights in August. Road-tripped to Vegas to see Dropkick Murphys play at The Joint at HRH. Wanted to stay at HRH, was WAY too expensive, and began to google nearby hotels so I could walk (stumble, whatever) back to my hotel room and not have to pay for a taxi or the monorail. I found this little hotel, recently re-modeled, with cheap rooms through Expedia or Travelocity. The ratings varied from fair to good, so I figured \"why not?\" since I'm tired of Travelodge and it was, literally, across the street from HRH. Let's break it down... Plus... +Good service +Offered food and cheap bucket-beer and pizza combos. Never ordered anything, but reviews said it was worth the buy +Mini \"Rehab\" pool party during the afternoon at big pool. Live DJ, bar, etc. Bouncers very friendly to hotel guests. Again, didn't go (I don't like drinking when there's kids around), but seemed nifty. +Several pools on property +BIG room, basic cable, 2 A/C units that worked wonderful, living room, minifridge, microwave--all included with any room booked +Bed was actually fairly comfy +Short 5 minute walk to the best little liquor store on Harmon Blvd +(For my purposes) HRH adjascent +Walking distance to several fast-food joints  Minus... -Auxillary pools could have been cleaner. Leaf debris, ew. -Auxillary pools music could have been playing a little louder -Pool chairs were seriously old. Fix it -Close to airport. You can hear the planes...I managed to tune it out, so not that bad, really. -Recent remodeled rooms still needed some touch-ups -Parking was a little crappy at times -East Vegas, 5-min car ride from strip; definitely not walking distance -Far from Vegas nightlife (unless you wanted to be ripped off by HRH clubs)  We had a pretty great stay. I'm a really picky traveller, and this trip meant a lot to me. I'd totally go back here. Their minifridge kicked the ass off the one I had at the LHC Travelodge for Tube Float. On a parting note, there was a flash flood and a huge electrical storm on the last night of our stay. We took our kitchen chairs and alcohol outside and watched from the stairwell as lightning struck the strip. Instead of disciplining us, they said: \"Rock on!\" and allowed us to enjoy the humid night.  Oh, and if you're silly...they have huge frogs on the property. Fun to chase."}
{"text":"I have never written a negative review, but we were treated so poorly here.  First we paid for a room with 2 Queen beds, but at check in they told us they were full and only had the same room but with one queen and a pull out sofa.  For no reduced price they gave us what we found out was a much inferior room and there was no pull out couch.  After 1-1/2 hours of calls from us,  they finally found a room with 2 beds at close to 9 pm.  We had to pack all our things by ourselves and move with no compensation whatsoever.  The new room was a one bedroom, which is what our room should have been to begin with, but wasn't!  So first they downgraded our room with no discount.  Then they made us move rooms 2 buildings over, again with no compensation when there was a King Suite just down the hall with no one there. At least now my two sons and I all have a bed to sleep in."}
{"text":"This place keeps winning reader's choice awards in local publications because of their great, authentic Greek food and fantastic service. The first time I ate here, I ordered the pork chops, cooked to perfection with secret Greek seasonings. It took me a while to determine what exactly it was that made them taste so good. After learning the recipe from another Greek place in town, I've been making my own at home. But I still go there because they have something else in the food that nobody can replicate. All their souvlaki is delicious and everyone I've been there with loves Pegasus' own pita bread and hummous. The place is always busy and has an authentic feel on weekend evenings, complete with a belly-dancer moving from table to table. The Greek beer is good, too."}
{"text":"I dream of the Saganaki cheese at Pegasus.  After being fried, the cheese is flamb√©ed at the table and served in the pan.  If you visit I highly recommend trying it with plenty of lemon. I usually accompany it with a selection of appetizers or follow it with lamb souvlakia.  I visited the old location on once or twice and I was optimistic when Pegasus moved closer to my home. The building in Altadore has a bit of a sorted past and restaurants operating in this location did not hold my attention until Pegasus came along.  Now I regularly visit this family business.  I've given it five stars but I must say that the two types of house red wine are not my favourites.  They seem to be offered at most Greek restaurants but they're not as full or as dry as I would like. I've not yet tried the other red wines offered at Pegasus."}
{"text":"Just to clarify this review is on Alexis Resort and NOT the restaurant..  My wife and I ended up spending a night there, not by choice United booked us there, from Monday to Tuesday, since our flight was canceled.   First of all this place should be called Motel and not Hotel.  All of the doors open outside.  Upon entering our room we have notice a strong and not pleasant smell.  Well the place is pet friendly so that could explain the smell.  Next we have decided to go for a walk.  The area surrounding the motel is not the safest area, a lot of shady characters.    Then we decided to have few drinks with people that were in the same situation.  After few drinks we notice a couple at the other table taking lines of cocaine.  Yes I'm not kidding, and that's when we called it a night. Got back to our room, only to find bugs crawling all over the bathroom countertop, and kitchen floor.  Thank god I didn't have a black light with me.  Who knows what I would find. Counters in the lobby and bar area are dirty and sticky. To sum it up: place stinks, it's infested with insects, and not the greatest area after dark."}
{"text":"Our experience was a mixed bag. Appies and pastry deserts were very good however the creme caramel desert desert was awful and the main courses  bland. Coffee tasted burnt and they also ran out off coffee cream (but a convenience store was next door). Service was non existent and we often had to walk up to the bar for service and as i wasn't drinking I waited one hour before my water glass was refilled.  Pegasus needs to pick up their socks."}
{"text":"Hands-down, this is the best greek restaurant I have ever been too. The food is sooooo good, the service is fantastic and the atmosphere is great. Our food came out within a timely manner, and was absolutely delicious. Their pita bread is made in house and is extremely unique. The calamari is big and perfectly cooked. The saganaki is to die for. I can't wait to go back again. Their entrees are a little pricy, just because they aren't huge, but the tapas and appies are really reasonable so if you get one of those and then an entree, you're all set.   I can't wait to go back again! Honestly, no complaints :)"}
{"text":"Group of eight of us came for appetizers and drinks while visiting for a competition. We waited 15min for the apps and just about a hour for our drinks! The food was barely warm when it came out; the chips and salsa was straight from the can and bag. Almost nothing we ordered was fresh. Wouldn't recommend to a friend. It is considered a \"lounge\". Atmosphere need work as well."}
{"text":"Ol Peggie Sues is opened again in Altadore. The new location seems a bit strange if you compare it to the old location on 14 st, Its in one of those neighborhood strip malls where you'd usually find a convinience store that rents VHS copies of steven segal movies.  I arrived at 10pm after the kitchen closed and the owner still welcomed us in and opened the kitchen which is a great gesture. The place was still packed. I ordered 3 appetizers and an entree. Lamb shoulder was my main and it was a tasty lil fixin. I feel rushed right now with my review but would completely suggest this to anybody looking for some good greek food.  5 Drunken Anthony Quinn's out of 5"}
{"text":"I grew up coming to this restaurant.  Takis, the owner, is one of the kindest and most hospitable people I've ever met.  Our family would come in for dinner and he would always greet us by name, hug us and come sit with us and catch up. The restaurant was always full, and he would still always make a point of doing this.  Amazing man.   The ambiance - truly Greek. I love it.  I have vivid memories of coming here and seeing belly dancers while we ate, watching people sip their flaming ouzo, and parties with people dancing and singing.  So. much. fun.   As for the food..this restaurant single handedly set my standard for lamb shoulder.  This is the first place I ever tried lamb shoulder and I fell in love.  The meat falls off the bone, is full of flavour and moist. Served with a hot mustard and greek potatoes...SO. GOOD.   Every time I come back to Alberta and visit my dad this is where I request that we go."}
{"text":"Not so good tonight, moussaka had large half cooked vegetables, leg of lamb was barely warm, server good to start then got distracted by resetting tables despite nobody waiting . Full house but this new location squeezes everybody together you cant move!  Sorry wouldn't go back for food or ambiance:("}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Greek food so when we moved to Calgary I immediately wanted to check out Greek restaurants to establish a go-to. I am not sure that Pegasus is the one but it might be worth another visit.  Our party of 4 started out with an appetizer platter consisting of tyropita, spanakopita, calamari, feta, hummus, tzatziki and pita. Everything was excellent except the calamari which was underdone and the pita which was fried and therefore greasy.  I was the only person to not order a lamb dish and went for the chicken souvlaki. The accompanying Greek salad was outstanding but my souvlaki and lemon-roasted potatoes appeared fried like the pita we had earlier and was slightly greasy as well. As a rule I am not a huge fan of fried foods so this was a major turn-off.   My dining partners loved their lamb so I guess the key for future visits is to avoid the souvlaki. Despite the restaurant being full,  the service was quite good and the food came out of the kitchen hot and in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Treated horrible, hotel staff very inconsiderate And doesn't work well with the guest here, i was forced to stay out of my room for hours, even though we had the money to get into our rooms, basically leaving my service animals, left in the room unintended for hours!!!"}
{"text":"Why oh why is your food never hot?  I stopped going a couple years ago for that reason. Went back Saturday to give them another shot....food lukewarm. Fool me once."}
{"text":"Out nd about and craving something tasty and thought of Pegasus.  Haven't had Greek in a while and was really looking forward to some savory garlicky goodness.  The location is perfect for those in South Calgary as a great neighbourhood eatery. It's in a small strip mall with a liquor store, coffee shop, beauty salon and gym.  They have a nice outdoor patio area and they have it sheltered from the parking lot which is nice as it's right on the front of mall area.  The menu itself is small but gives the right amount of variety and hit all the expected Greek dishes.  We opted for the straight forward chicken souvlaki and beef souvlaki with a side of pita and tatziki.  The souvlaki comes with your choice of two sides.  I chose greek salad and rice while Derek chose greek fries and rice.  The beef was nice, very tender, juicy, good flavour and the sides complimented the meat.  The chicken could have been better but it could also just be me.  The chicken was likely thighs so a bit of dark meat which I'm not a huge fan of but also some skin and fat which didn't work for met at all.  The chicken was also kind of greasy.  I assume the meat was marinated but but this was just greasy.  The rice and salad were good with a nice amount of feta in the salad and a tangy dressing.  The tatziki is one of the best I've had, the right amount of tang, garlic and the consistency was creamy.  The pita was fried so it was light but also a bit greasy, would have prefered it to just be fresh pita or baked.  This was a take out experience and I can't say the paper container added anything to the taste but I did like that it was probably biodegradeable.  Will eat there again and will eat in next time.  I think the ambiance will add to the good but I won't be chosing chicken next time."}
{"text":"Ah, Greek hospitality. Takis (the owner) greets you as though he's welcoming you into his home. To start, we ordered the saganaki cheese, fried in a skillet and flambeed as it makes its way to the table, and spanakopita. For our main dish we shared the Pikkillia platter, which included an assortment of moussaka, dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), prawns, salmon, keftethes (meatballs), and brizoles (pork cutlets), served with Greek salad and tzatziki. Everything tasted so good!"}
{"text":"I stayed there for 3 nights, not planned. I had reservations at Riviera but was not allowed early check in so ended up checking in at Alexis, with my boyfriends family. (Different rooms)   I must say it was an absolute delight staying there. Once checking in, me and my boyfriend were not attended right away but it was fine. Even though it was 4 in the morning, they weren't rude , just a bit slow.  Once we arrived to our room it was great! Literally looks like a one room apartment. Everything was clean, everything in the hotel worked. It was just great. I would definitely and am going to stay here again for my next visit."}
{"text":"I've only been to a couple of Greek restaurants (does Opa! count?) so I wouldn't really know the good ones from the bad ones.  What I do know is that I had a nice meal and a good time at Pegasus.  We went for my sister's birthday, who is notorious for picking culturally diverse restaurants on her special day, and I was pretty skeptical because I thought I wouldn't know what to order.  Luckily, my Dad was smart enough to order a bunch of appetizers for us all to try and helped me figure out what I would like best.  I forget what the dish was called, but goodness gracious was it ever delicious!  Everything was!  I wasn't really a huge fan of the grape leaf wraps - a little to bitter for me - but everything else was fantastic!  My favourite part about this restaurant was how authentically Greek it was... well, to me anyways!  The decorations all screamed Greek and so did the band that was playing the background music.  They even came over and played my sister a little personal birthday song.  The highlight of the night was how red she got when they wouldn't leave.  I don't know what Greek food is normally priced at, but this place didn't seem outrageous.  I wasn't leaning towards drinking water and eating bread, so it couldn't have been that bad.  You get a decent amount of food with each dish, so you don't feel ripped off.  If I have a craving for Greek, I'll probably go back to Pegasus since I already now it's a great time with good food and nice people!"}
{"text":"Hand down its the best resturant iv ever tried in calgary, i literally ate for 3 hours continiously, great food,  staff and service .. and u can feel the family bussiness vibe in the place."}
{"text":"I honestly liked the quality of food and a soft spoken, polite service.  I did not like the amount of time needed to get the food on our table.  Portion size was very decent, and and chef's work was impressive. A little bit not exactly the way I like it, but that's just my taste, no biggie. Honestly good food.  The place is tiny, though, so if you are going to check it out in a big company - book ahead or you'd be in trouble!  Compared to the total Greek awesomeness like Calypso Tavern, Pegasus is definitely a step behind - yet it is a nice place, absolutely worth visiting.  Sort of like a \"plan B\" to me - but in Toronto this would have been a solid \"plan A\"."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a huge company event.  The Alexis Park Resort was hosting meetings pre-event.  So, we didn't  really stay at the hotel over night. Just the conference rooms, and ended up eating at the Pegasus bar and grill, located at the resort.   When we sat down, I went into \"Yelp\" to check in. and was very disappointed  with seeing a 2.5 stars.  BUT, because we were pressed for time, we ignored it, and ended up eating there.   Well, well, well.... to my surprise, delicious food! VERY tasty, full of flavor, juicy and omg, so yummy.   They did not have a lot of choices on their menu, (mind you, this is a \"bar\" and grill) but, the two items out of 10 (or maybe even less) was still excellent.  Highly recommend the burger, and chicken taco.  The service was also great.    If you look through the rest of the negative review for this location, you will see that they are referring to the actual resort, complaining about their room, about the check-in, and service.   Unfortunately, because this place \"Pegasus bar & Grill\" is located inside of Alexis Park Resort, they are getting all their bad reviews.  They truly do not deserve such a low score on Yelp."}
