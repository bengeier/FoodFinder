{"text":"The decor is really pretty and modern. The food is just average like any ofther ayce. The beef needs more sauce, a little too bland. The wasabi wasn't good and had to keep asking for more. Manager was nice and always got the things we asked for rigjt away and everything was overall good."}
{"text":"Went in because of the sashimi collection for my boyfriend's birthday. Was told right off from the beginning that it was cash only and after two hours to give them back the table. Good thing we had cash.

The set up is nice but the tables aren't that clean. Felt sticky and I could see residue. They have a wide sashimi collection and the first place I've seen red tuna offered at an ayce. I loved their beef tatami. 

The menu after sashimi was limited. I'm surprised they didn't have cold soba or soft drinks on the menu. All hot foods were cooked Chinese restaurant style with that thick clear coating on the vegetables that I didn't care for.

They were prompt taking away our finished dishes so we had room. The food came out pretty slow after telling us we only had 2 hours to eat. First item came out after 30 minutes and that was the miso soup! Not everything we ordered came either. I asked a waiter about that and she told me if things don't come after awhile that it's probably lost and we should reorder, then gave me another sheet. I remember our second round of sashimi came finally after our dessert and the cheque so we had two plates of sashimi on the table.

Very disorganized. Took ten percent off the bill for cash payment and 12% service charge. I don't think the restaurant will last that long..."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day!!! Not sure when the grand opening was, but its new ayce in Scarborough area. They have an one page with two side menu. Free sodas! On this specific day, there was 'scallop in shell' where they give 2x per customer. We mainly had sashimi...The list from what i recalled were: Salmon, Red Tuna (Yes, its true!), Surf Clam, Octopus, Scallop, Ebi Shrimp, Tamago, Red Snapper, Beef Tataki etc.,

We ordered a lot of ebi shrimp (like 400+ for 5 ppl) =P
We got grilled shrimp that you have to peel. This tasted fine.
We got this egg seafood custard. Pretty alright.
We got beef tataki. Nice taste.
Sweet Potato Tempura. Average.
Spider Roll (4pc per order). Alright
Winter Roll (8 pcs per order). Consist of eel and shrimp tempura wrapped with crispy stuff. (Okay).
Fried Oysters (Good). Each is ordered as one...
Baked Flounder (Good). Watch out for bones though.

Then we went on to desserts...Quite a good amount of selection as well...

Pro: Server do come often to take your order when required.
- If you pay cash, you get 10% Off!
- Group of 5 or more = Auto-Gratuity of 12%!
- There's some food that were good or better.
- Good space.
- Server's were accommodating and friendly to check our food when orders were missed and not give attitude about it, which can happen often in Asian restaurant.

Con: Washroom is small for the capacity they're holding.
- Food ordered is hit-n-miss to get them. Our example was if we ordered more than 8 selected items, we would only get 50% of them!
- Scallop sashimi didn't taste that nice. Not that sweet like at 'Sushi Legend'.
- Had to consistently follow up with servers about our previous order worrying that they would bring out all our previous orders relating to too much food we potentially can't finish, then we MAY get charged! (Which i'm sure doesn't happen too often)

Overall, this place can be alright and has potential, while staff and restaurant require more brush-up of orders being brought out consistently and this place can be busy quite oftened.

Price on weekend I believe $27 pp before tax n tip!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend you to go to this restaurant for the following reasons:

1. The food comes very slow. You should expect very long time sitting with no food in front of you.

2. The staffs r probably not trained. They are not familiar with table locations, and keeps taking food to the wrong table. 

3. MOST Importantly: THERE WAS A BROKEN GLASS IN OUR MANGO YOGURT. WE ALMOST EAT IT. SO BE CAREFUL IF YOU GO TO THIS PLACE WITH YOUR CHILDREN. 

4. Food is average level. Soy sauce is a little too sweet. Considering the price (12%tips included in bill) and quality of service, it's not worth it. You can find many Japanese restaurants with same price but better service."}
{"text":"Came for the red tuna sashimi. I would say there's a wider selection when it comes to sashimi than other AYCE sushi restaurants. Also the desert are amazing and I'll definitely recommend to try them especially the mango pudding/yogurt. 

The service is average, and just be careful if you're paying with cash - we had an unpleasant experience where the cashier claims that she returned the appropriate amount of money, but in fact she didn't. Luckily the waiters were very professional and saw that we paid the right amount of money. Problem solved. I would probably revisit if it wasn't for their cashier..LOL"}
{"text":"Credit/debit machine not set up, cash only. Opening special, if paying with cash you get a 10% discount. 12% tip is included in the bill. Reasonable pricing. 

Located inside the Splendid China Tower on the bottom floor so parking is convenient. Standard food for AYCE sushi. Very nice decor and clean menu (with spelling errors) because it's new.

The wasabi tasted like green dyed horseradish."}
{"text":"DON'T GO..... 

If I could give no star, I would give. Terribe terrible service, or I should say customer service does not exsist in the restaurant. For food, there is pretty much nothing special for ppl to eat. PLUS toooooo much rice on all sushi rolls. I would not recommend anyone to go there. Don't waste your money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the interior design of this restaurant. It is very new and in a centralized location. However, it is a very typical all you can eat sushi place, more typical than typical. If you want to get full on some rolls and desserts, it could be a place for you. I personally have a higher expectation for sashimi freshness and taste for even the warm food.
My suggestion for this restaurant is to slim down on choices and get better at those choices."}
{"text":"Please do not waste your money here. 80% of ordered items never been delivered. Staffs are not professional, food presentation sucks and taste mediocre. Didn't honour the coupon offered online. Only accept cash with excuse of machines are not ready.......Will never come here again!"}
{"text":"Going to be brutally honest, this is probably one of the WORST AYCE sushi places I've ever eaten - so much that I felt compelled to write my first Yelp review post.

Came in on a Saturday night. Pretty busy.

CONS:

1. Service extremely sloww, MORE THAN HALF of our food did not come. Weirdly enough, all the cooked food came out first before the sashimi/sushi. Usually at other ayce places, the raw stuff comes out first...

2. Told the waiter that many of our food didn't come and he replied it was due to the busy night, which is acceptable. But we looked at the chefs and they were just busy talking to each other. 

3. Many of the sashimi did not even look fresh nor tasted fresh.

4. No soft drinks on menu.


ANY PROS?? Um... at least the wait staff cleared the table quickly. And the manager/host was nice. That's it.

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Came here for weekend dinner. I liked the seating as it was mostly booths so more privacy than other AYCE places like Matsuda and Ten-ichi.  

They have a good sized menu with variety. The sashimi tasted really fresh and the chicken teriyaki was cooked really well. The food was good overall except the lamb kebobs which tasted rubbery. 

Service was alright, even though theyre only there to put dishes down and clear them away since you write down the order yourself on a piece of paper. 10% off discount with cash payment. 

Overall this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"bad handler thumb in soup sauce plate put on top of the food poor chief make ugly dishes not worth and harm your health eating there 31$ no worth at all."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an all you can eat near your home, this would be the 'convenient' option. However, if you have an extra 5 minutes or so, I suggest for you to go elsewhere, and anywhere else, besides this place.

This place opened up not too long ago so we decided to give it a try (from a friend's suggestion). First time we came here, around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday, the manager told us the place is fully booked and full for the night so we were forced to leave. We decided to reserve a table the second time (for 2 people only). We were seated immediately and the manager at the time was really nice - bonus service points there. However, he offered us to sit at a 4 person booth, but to the constraint that we were only able to sit on one side because AC water was leaking on the other side... so that was the downside to having more room for food on the table. We thought that was a bit sketchy... but sat down anyway since we had more room on the table.

During the second round of our order, we noticed nothing has arrived after nearly 30 minutes. We had to ask the manager and he realized that there was an issue with the printing machine, and that nothing was going into the kitchen?? Unacceptable... the fact that none of the staff noticed, or cared to tell the customers.

The food does come a bit slow, even on a weekday. And oh, if you are Asian, the waiters will 'auto-assume' that you will understand 'mandarin' - something I do not appreciate. The food presentation could also be a bit better, considering you are at a restaurant.

Definitely not a place I would recommend, nor is the price worth it here. However, if you do want to give this place a try in which you might have better luck than I had, REMEMBER to make a booking. Otherwise, Yamamoto would be a better option across the street."}
{"text":"Ok so far I've been here three times.  Twice on a Sunday, and once on a Tuesday.  My experience here on sundays have been great, the sashimi was fresh.  The Tuesday here does not seem as fresh as Sunday.

I'm going to suggest if you're going to come here, do it on a sunday, because there's a difference in quality of food.  Not sure if it's just different sushi chefs, but on Tuesday I ordered the squid sushi, and they kept on bringing me this diced octopus sushi, after the second order I said this isn't the squid sushi, and then they came back telling me they were out.

Overall I wouldn't say its the servers fault, the servers try to help as much as they can, they're always running around, if anything I think this place is understaffed which leads to the bad service.  

This place has potential to do well, but they do need to get a lot of things sorted so it's managed properly"}
