{"text":"Leur pâte à pizza bio à base de kamut est interessante, le service est rapide, souriant et chaleureux. Je n'ai jamais utilisé la livraison car il me suffit de traverser la rue pour aller chercher mes pizzas ou mon poulet boucanier. Il font aussi un couscous mais je ne l'ai jamais essayé. La cuisine est visible et très propre.   Il leur arrive d'oublier des items dans les boites: les couverts en plastique ou la sauce manquaient parfois."}
{"text":"The establishment participate in the Foodora.ca delivery service. I ordered from them Valentine's evening. We were actually looking for sushi however the only sushi offering was all vegan & vegetarian. We wanted some animal protein.   Au Tarot menu on Foodora.ca was a bit confusing so we had to make a call into Au Tarot. The first person we reached, gave a number to call as he didn't have the answer to a simple question of the menu. The other number we called, the question seemed to stump him also. Finally we spoke with someone who was able to answer the simple question on their menu's pricing layout.   Once we finally placed our order (note: if you have a coupon, their is a section to enter it after you create your account & enter in your credit card information) we were keep up to date via text message:  1st text: your order has been received and is up for preparation.   2nd text: your order is being made  3rd text: [driver's name] is picking up your order  4th text: your order is on the way  5th text: your order has arrived  This entire process was about 28 minutes after the submit button was pressed.   As for the food...  We both ordered a Tajine w/ couscous. For protein she ordered the veal and I the chicken. The portion was large enough for us to share the protein and still have some for left over. So for $22/Tajine, we did get plenty off food. I really enjoyed the veal. The meat was very juicy and the raisins added to the couscous made for a nicely added sweetness.   Other than the \"not so friendly\" user experience of the Foodora.ca website/menus; the dining in experience was great!"}
{"text":"Service de commande et livraison hors-pair !  Ces gens sont sérieux pour ce qui est du couscous à Montréal. C'est toujours bon, les portions sont généreuses et le la prix raisonnables. Le couscous royal est délicieux. Est-ce que je l'ai dis ? Le service est vraimeNt très bon. Cet endroit est en voie de devenir une institution à Montréal. Je recommande sans hésiter."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed by an Oriental. This one did. Big time. The delivery was half complete and the Tajine portion was ludicrous. Such a shame to call it \"Tajine\". This restaurant is definitely not up to what the Chef promises. To be avoided at any price. NEVER AGAIN !"}
{"text":"Food to go only !! Just 2 tables to wait.. Good enough coucous , gentle service , raisonable price; seems clean."}
