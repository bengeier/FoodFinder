{"text":"Très bon, en effet je crois que le bbq est la spécialité! J'ai pris de porc et du poulet."}
{"text":"Great BBQ pork. Great BBQ duck. I asked for mine to be on rice. It comes with bok choy (yayyy!!) and ginger and green onion sauce. So good!   The servers are friendly too. I was in and out I. Less than half an hour since they're extremely fast.   And since I don't speak Cantonese the service was minimum but still loved it!   And very inexpensive also. $9 with tax + tip for a satisfying dinner"}
{"text":"Succulent chicken and pork. Amazing broth in the soup. The price point cannot be beat for the quality. Humble decor. I went there today as I was searching for another resto. Decided to eat here. I am glad I stumbled upon this gem."}
{"text":"For lunch, I had fried noodles with chicken and a coconut milkshake. So delicious! They really give you a lot of food for the price. :)"}
{"text":"Quand on dit un restaurant est bon, on juge pas seulement sur leur cuisine, il y a aussi une importance accordée à la qualité de service. Les serveurs ici sont plutôt sympathiques. Par contre, la vieille femme porte les lunettes aux cheveux courts à la caisse, elle est pas du tout accueillante, ni très polie.                                            Avec le prix, on attendait pas d'avoir de service impeccable ici, mais au moins, une minimum de politesse, s'il vous plaît madame !                                                                      C'est vraiment dommage que son service gâche la qualité de ce restaurant. Je préfère payer un peu plus chère pour avoir une service agréable, au moins correct que voir sa gueule."}
{"text":"They close at 7:00pm, I got there at 6:30 and they were very happy to sit me. I ordered BBQ pork and duck on rice. Within 3 minutes he was serving me and apologized for the wait. Heck my seat cushion wasn't even warm. They brought hot green tea while I waited. It was super delicious. Everything was hot and cooked just right. It was a plateful of food. I was done and out of there by 6:50 and he was still sitting customers with a warm smile. Dinner with tax. $8.05.  I will go back again. Go for the food, not the ambience. Place is clean, just not much to look at."}
{"text":"After being introduced to this little place, my boyfriend and I are smitten. We're always looking for excuses to go to Chinatown so we can stop by and have their really tasty \"dong-lai-cha\" (cold milk tea) or \"dong-ling-cha\" (cold lemon iced tea). Unfortunately, they close really early at night (7pm), so it's only really good for lunch or mid-afternoon snack. Everybody's friendly and the food is reasonably priced. It's definitely worth it for the amount of food you get. You will never leave with a stomach empty!"}
{"text":"Went with bbq duck on rice. Good food and good price."}
{"text":"I keep coming back. Great food, great deals, the wait staff works very hard... a Chinese hole in the wall gem!"}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant full points since the food is tasty, simple but comforting, comes in a generous portion and is not expensive - what you want when you`re very hungry. I usually like the noodle soups (BBQ duck or Wonton), but recently discovered the BBQ duck and chicken rice which I really liked. Service is also rapid and the waiter is very amiable and polite. If you go at non-peak hours, they will usually refill your tea as often as needed. I`ll definitely be going back to this place, but maybe next time to try their breakfast or late lunch specials now that they have printed new menus with translations."}
{"text":"I ordered smoky pork and chicken rice. tasted fabulous! the location is not obvious from outside but many customers are coming around. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Dobe and Andy is the furthest you get from a typical chinatown touristy haunt. This means it's already scored a point.  The setting is that of a dingy diner and the place is quite certainly a no-frills joint. But do not let the Chinese-only specials menu and the green tea in plastic cups deter you.  I second the pork and duck combo, as well as the Shanghai fried noodles and the soy sauce chicken with rice.  I found our server struggling a little with translating the specials menu (breakfast specials, $3.75, lunch specials in the $5 area). At the same time the smiles and enthusiasm completely compensated for the slight language barrier.   The food, price and setting alone would earn it three stars (not a place you'd bring a date), but the service is so great I give it the four. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The only vegetarian lunch option (Buddha Vegetarian Rice or Fried Noodles) was very good. A huge amount of food and good flavor for a vegetarian dish. Slightly more expensive than the menu price though. Overall a great lunch and the price is still great. I was surprised there was a vegetarian option at all."}
{"text":"Finding our usual soup place (Deer Garden) closed for vacation, my wife and I sought out a similarly inexpensive alternative and were thrilled to stumble upon Dobe & Andy.  We decided to try the Won Ton Soup w/Duck, and also a plate of Soy Sauce Chicken w/Rice and were quite pleased with both.  The Won Ton's were particularly impressive, each containing a ball of pork and an entire small shrimp.  They also serve a variation that includes a Chinese vegetable (the server did not know the its name) with the pork and shrimp, but we decided to save trying that for another day.  We topped everything off with a tasty Bubble Black Tea!"}
{"text":"Arrived here early in the morning, unfortunately before any of the BBQ meat was available. We had to ask the waiter to point out what was available at that time, which he was able to.  They serve you with cups of hot tea to go along with your meal which is a very traditional Chinese thing to do, and I don't see this done often enough.  *Stir fried beef egg noodles: This is like \"pad see ew\" at Thai restaurants. Wide rice noodles stir fried with beef slices and vegetables. Very large portion, greasy, savory, and satisfying. Easy to eat even for people not familiar with Chinese food. *Breakfast special (congee with fried noodles): For $5.75 you get a big bowl of steaming hot congee with a plate of fried noodles (without meat). We chose the ground pork with preserved egg for our congee. The congee is very lightly flavored and I feel the rice was not broken down enough for this style, but it was a good dish nonetheless. The fried noodles are okay, no meat, taste exactly the way they look.  Overall this place is \"good\" and it does come across as a tad basic based on my experience during breakfast, but I may be biased because I didn't get to try the BBQ meat that everyone on Yelp raves about. Short of that observation, as an Asian-Canadian who grew up in Toronto, this place absolutely cannot compete with what we have down there.  Also - who charges tax and then takes cash-only? I hate that this restaurant has this policy."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ pork and noodle soup and a milk tea. Was a very nice dish. If I was a local, this would be in my weekly/monthly rotation. The folks running the place are really friendly."}
{"text":"The Worst Service and the dirtiest restaurant - Restaurant Dobe & Andy ????????  My sister went there for 2 order of drinks just to kill time. It costs $3.8 tax included. She paid $5 with coins ($2 + $2 + $1) as she does not have a $5 bill. The cashier gave back 20 cents only as change and told my sister - I DO NOT NEED TO GIVE YOU MORE AS YOU ONLY GAVE ME $4. The cashier miscounted that my sister only gave $4 for the drinks. Of course, my sister argued that it was $5 instead of $4, but the cashier did not listen.  In Canada, normally we pay 15% tips. Of course, it is not mandatory. If you get bad service, you do not have to pay the extra 15%. No matter what, even the customer did not pay enough tips; she, the cashier, should always give the change back.  The food is ok, but it is very dirty. Do not expect any service inside. The restaurant only looks for money and have no ethnic code. Very cheap and immoral place."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. Fast, not fancy. Yummy. Good portion.  Loud! Lots of locals.  Cheap."}
{"text":"We found Dobe and Andy after our first restaurant choice was closed.  With a few recommendations from our very nice waitress we were pleasantly surprised with how delicious everything was. Even my picky 10 & 8 year old boys said they loved their meals. The roasted duck on both rice and noodles was a big hit. The spring rolls were yummy as were the dumplings.  Very authentic and extremely reasonably priced. Only catch is it is cash only which we didn't discover until time to pay and had to run to a very close cash machine. We enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, EXCELLENT value, and super quick! Had the lunchtime Sze Chun dumplings, while some other the other folks at the table had noodles and soup. Tasted everything and it was all delicious!"}
{"text":"Beau bon pas cher.  I've had the 3 meat dish (duck, chicken, roast pork on rice), rice and beef, rice and eggplant and wonton with noodles.  Order this with a Hong Kong milk tea and you will have a filling meal under 15$ tax tip in."}
{"text":"You know you've hit the \"real thing\" when you enter the building that houses Dobe and Andy!!  An office building serves as the backdrop for this incredible culinary experience.  I'm all about glistening well cooked pigs, ducks and chickens hanging in the windows....the almost candied apple appearance of the succulent skin of these animals makes my mouth water just thinking about it!  I promised one of my co-workers lunch while in Montreal on business last week and had him choose the spot....and let me tell you I was NOT disappointed.  The place was not overly crowded but abuzz with lots of conversations that I could not make out, because any of the Oriental languages are not my norm.  Obviously a hot spot because if the locals eat there, and you could tell there were plenty of regulars, it has to be good.  Dan recommended his favorite dish of rice, steamed baby bok choy topped with the most generous slices of a combination of pork and duck.  Warm tea, not sweet, was served in brightly colored tupperware style cups...you know the ones, right?  Chopsicks and a ceramic soup spoon so you can scoop as fast as you like were served on the side.  No need for seasonings....it was juuuuust right!  At a hair over $5 per person, we rolled out of there fully satisfied and ready for a nap.  If you find yourself in Montreal...by all means head to Chinatown specifically to Dobe and Andy's and enjoy!"}
{"text":"A real gem of a place: the decor is non-existent, the service can be spotty, but order BBQ duck and BBQ  pork over rice and nothing else will matter. The price can't be beat ($6.75 for almost anything on the lunch menu) and the portions are more than generous."}
{"text":"Classic HK cafe, great prices and pretty consistent quality.  Gets hectic and busy during lunch, but they also serve breakfast and have afternoon specials. When it's busy you can ask the waiter if you should order from their butcher section ie: bbq pork, duck, chicken on rice or noodles or should you order from the kitchen for your fried noodles or fried rice noodle soup etc."}
{"text":"Now Chinatown tends to be one of those hit or miss kind of places. Some restaurants are spot on, some are just plain terrible. This place however, I find offers some of the best bbq duck etc.  It is located underneath Kam Fung and right across a butchery. It doesn't look like much, but you really cannot go wrong with their bbq duck/chicken/pork etc. It's super fast the service and man is it cheap there. We ordered a plate of fries, bbq duck porridge, and soy sauce chicken & bbq duck on rice. All of that? 14 buckaroos baby. I mean it was the cheapest lunch I ever had....in a long time.  I do believe this place is open for breakfast too, like at 8AM or something. But anyways, I really recommend eating here if you had to choose from all the restaurants in Chinatown. It's simple, cheap, and fast."}
{"text":"Simple Hong Kong style cafétéria with a good choice of noodles, baked rice, and other Cantonese delight. Had the breakfast, 4.75$, hk style macaroni and ham, toast and an egg. There are a few other gems in the mall... Will be back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the relatively high average Yelp rating here, because if this is among the best Chinese food that Montréal has to offer, then, sadly, that doesn't say much about Chinese food in Montréal.   Like a true Cantonese diner, there's a large variety of offerings here, whether rice dishes, fried noodle dishes, or noodle bowls. Everything is very inexpensive, but that having been said, you get what you pay for, which might be a lot in terms of quantity, but not much in terms of quality. Indeed, I was here traveling with my Cantonese parents and they didn't have much nice things to say about the whole experience either.   A cheap, inexpensive meal - and that's about all there is to say about it."}
{"text":"C'est mon resto fast food prefere au quartier chinois.le prix est vraiment po cher..et le gout est bon!!le service est rapide aussi!ma plate prefere est le bbq pork noodles...je mange au moins une fois par semain ici...mais la seule chose que je dois dire...le propiete dois renover un peu son resto..."}
{"text":"I enjoy dropping in to Dobe & Andy for a quick and cheap bite to eat. I absolutely adore their duck soup and will keep coming back for that exact meal. They're located in the same complex that Maison Kam Fung   is located in. If your hungry and short on cash you can always count on Dobe & Andy to fill you up."}
{"text":"A typical Hong Kong \"Tea Restaurant\", they have a very diverse menu and make most of their dishes very well.  My personal favourite is their rice noodle stir fried with beef and soya sauce (#G on the lunch menu If I recall correctly), any of the fried vermicelli dishes, Fried rice with fermented crab sauce and beef, Salted fish and chicken fried rice and the Roasted pork and duck on rice, albeit I always order it with pork belly, which is an extra. They put garlic and chive cooked in oil on top of it, which makes it particularly succulent.   They probably have the best Milk Tea in the city, made with real tea leaves, and their cold Lemon Tea ain't half bad either. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated restaurants and definitely a highlight of Chinatown! This place brings you straight back to Hong Kong. Its a typical Cha Can Ting, serving typical cantonese food: roast meat, authentic wonton noodles, etc and it is dirt cheap!! You can get a selection of two roast meat with some boiled vegetables and rice for roughly $7.   Make sure you ask for their marinated green onion (it usually comes with the roast meat dishes), its the best!  Try to stay away from items on the menu that do not sound authentic (e.g. Singapore noodles, curry, etc)."}
{"text":"You see that bad boy, red, crispy duck hanging outside Chinatown staring you down. You walk nonchalantly past it like you usually do. THEN YOU STOP. You notice Dobe and Andy's to your right not really sure what to make of it. The duck calls to you. Can you dig it?   Well you can at Dobe and Andys for $6 with a full complementary meal of veggies and rice. A simple, yet delicious meal that reminds me of Home-cooking. Indulge in the simple things in life."}
{"text":"I read a review a d decided to order....everything is horrible... Beef with rice...no beef only fat and some kind of cabbage... Soup no taste at all.... Singapore noodles salty....spring rolls just awful... Not sure what people liked at that place... Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"Montréal overall has a lack of really good Chinese food compared to Toronto, Vancouver, and even where I'm from back in Michigan (shocker, right?). Anyway, I was really surprised to find really authentic Cantonese \"tea room\"-style food in such a space like this. Whenever I come here, I either get the ???? (stir-fried noodles with beef in a black bean sauce) and ????? (Guilin stir-fried spicy rice noodles). The ???? is arguably the most authentic I've had outside of China, but being a spice lover, I tend to gravitate towards the Guilin rice noodles, which they can also make into a noodle soup (????) if you prefer them that way!  Previously, I've also had their roast meat (they have duck, chicken, and pork to choose from) over rice, and while it was good, I've had better in Guangzhou (roast goose over rice is still something I find myself craving almost a year and a half later). They also serve a good milk tea, and if you get the lunch special, it comes with a drink so consider getting that with your food!"}
{"text":"Man, it's good food I ordered the first thing listed on the menu. Very satisfied with the amount of food and taste. Price worthy. After all the overcharging garbage food from other restaurants, I'd definitely come back for this restaurant when I'm back in Montreal.  Go if you're hungry"}
{"text":"I've had Cantonese BBQ in Hong Kong and this place is definitely on par. We got the duck and pork noodle soups and it was so delicious. The restaurant is located in a office/shopping mall which made it a little difficult to find but it was really worth it. A must try in Montreal Chinatown."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but more importantly it is so cheap!! Perfect for broke students like me :) I ordered the chicken Cantonese chow mein and it was really good, I wish it had some more vegetables and was spicier but for 8 bucks and the portion size I can't complain. They have a variety of sauces on the table so it is possible to make your food spicier as I did. My friend ordered the BBQ pork and she said it was delicious. Overall a great place for cheap eats but don't expect any sort of ambiance, that's not the purpose of this establishment."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Hong Kong style cafe restaurant in Montreal.  For 6.75$ plus 50 cent for a cold drink you get vast amount of menu options from their lunch special. They also serve Chinese BBQ meat by the pound. The restaurant is always busy at lunch time but service is fast.  I would recommend anyone to try this hidden gem in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Great place and very low pricing for HK style roast pork .... the roast pork is crispy n juicy . Skin is crispy and yummy . Not too salty and just nice seasoning."}
{"text":"Came here to try the duck and pork, I just wasn't sure whether to try it on noodles or rice, went with the rice. It was a good choice as the duck was really good as well as porc, rice came with onion which I think had been prepared with a salty sauce, other than that it was good overall, can't go wrong with that price: lunch for $7.75 tax included.  They served us complimentary hot tea. Menu also had lunch specials for $6."}
{"text":"One of the best midi/lunch specials I've seen so far. $6.25 + tax will get you a choice of two meats (you can see the deliciousness in the display across the hall, roast duck and pork especially), some baby bok choy and rice. I only managed to eat half of it; it was a mountain of food. They have a lot of choices besides that (noodles, soups, veggies on rice, etc.). May come in early to try the congee at breakfast sometime.   The service was really great, all smiles and very efficient. Places like this (in random office buildings, basic on the inside) are pretty common all around Asia, and they're the best places to eat. This place is no exception... Go now!"}
{"text":"My go-to breakfast spot in Chinatown. If I'm not having dim sum, I'm probably here at Dobe and Andy. The milk tea is the best Hong Kong style milk tea I've had here in Montreal. It's simple, rich, and memorable. You can choose to have it hot or cold, but I always prefer the cold one. The breakfast and lunch menus here are the epitome of student living, and one of the reasons why it is so popular among students. For under $10 you can get an incredibly delicious and filling meal. In fact, most of their breakfast menus are around $5!"}
{"text":"Ce n'est sûrement pas le plus bel endroit du quartier chinois, ni la meilleure soupe (le bouillon est plutôt fade), mais leur viande vaut vraiment le détour!  Et leurs prix aussi!  Les viandes proviennent du petit stand d'en face, dans le même centre commercial.  Vous aurez probablement envie d'en ramener chez vous...  (Surtout que ce n'est pas cher, on parle de 20$ pour un canard laqué entier, si ma mémoire est bonne)! Le porc était tendre et juteux, le canard était aussi excellent.  Les assaisonnements de la viande étaient bien balancés.  Mes seules réserves concernent la soupe et les nouilles, très ordinaires.  Optez plutôt pour des grillades sur du riz!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant regularly for several years. Only a very average Chinese Bistro but I always love the free Hong Kong style milk tea come with the meal. Recently I found the quality of the food dropped. Have to admit that the price is low but the quality of the food is poor. The tableware is dirty sometime. I also experienced twice they charged me higher price since they have two sets of menu. One for special time period, and one for the other time period. I also found other people complaining about the wrong price charged. Be sure to double check the bill.  I always have fish congee here because the congee took me a very long time to cook at home. My husband often has BBQ rice, but he is very reluctant to eat here. It is OK to try this place when you are looking for a filling meal and low price but don't hold a high expectation. I am just very unhappy today they charged me higher price again."}
{"text":"A truly authentic hole in the wall. Just through the doors of Place Quartier, lies an unassuming Hong Kong cafe that serves up Cha Chang Tang style foods just like I remember it in Hong Kong.   I always get the BBQ pork and soya sauce chicken rice. They cut their meats fresh from the butcher shop right across their restaurant. The sauce is always incredible. Chicken - tender. All at around $7-8! Great value.  Highly recommend to get milk tea (remember to add sugar!) With any special for just 50 cents!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a little bit run down but it's not too bad. There's not much decor going on. It kinda looks likes a food court. Also, the place is a little hard to spot cause it's inside a building and there's not too many signs that make it stand out.  FOOD: Classic Chinese comfort food. That means that it's nothing fancy, it's not the highest quality but it's quick and yummy. Although I did find the dishes inconsistent. It was either a bit too salty or too bland but overall, it was good! I'd come back here again if ever I'm in a rush to get a quick meal.  PRICE: Super inexpensive. I'd say most of the menu is under 10$, no matter what time of day it is. Although you are getting what you pay for so  I would say that quality is not the best but it's a nice spot for a quick cheap meal.  SERVICE: The service was quick and the waiter did what he had to do. For Chinatown, the staff was decent!"}
{"text":"The advantage here is the price , very low price and the food is good enough, fast service, free tea."}
