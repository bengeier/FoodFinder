{"text":"Poor: very pricey for very mediocre food. Renovations are beautiful and when you walk in its so nice you expect good food. Service was very slow and the screwed up everything from beginning to end. Forgot our starter, brought it out with the mains. We asked for salads instead of fries as a side and got both and where charged extra for the salads. Charged for juice to add to our beer. Black olives used not Kalamata olives for Greek salad. Janes chicken strips and frozen fries. Nothing fresh and made in house rather tasteless food. Asked to split the bill and that was screwed up. Went with two small kids and you would think they would serve us faster or even the kid first. Nope. The whole experience was a disaster. I had really high hopes for a nice new place to eat. I will never got back to costly for blah food."}
{"text":"The servers are gracious and patient.  The food is great and the ambiance quiet and casual.  I will definitely return in future."}
{"text":"This place just needs time, they're currently doing damage control as the previous owner was brutal.

I've been there a few times now and it's clear that the restaurant is giving it a great effort. 
They have Daily Specials and their menu is changing each week.  
The Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The Mill is back.  Great food, great service, beautiful patio, and reasonable prices.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Came in at lunchtime to an empty restaurant.  

What blew me away were the sweet potato fries.  Crispy.  

The burger was ok.  We met the owner and I saw the chef - nice people.  I would love to come back during a busy evening to re-evaluate.  I also missed out on trying their strawberry pie."}
