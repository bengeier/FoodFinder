{"text":"A farmers market, in an airport terminal? Wha?
No, that's the name of the place. It's not an actual farmer's market. But the place does offer some pretty healthy food and snack options.
I came here to get another bottled water, as I had just eaten a hearty sandwich, and needed water for the plane ride home. I walked by this place on  my way to the gate, and I bought my water from here.
The staff here was very friendly. They offered some of their food options, but I politely declined as I was stuffed from the lunch I had 15 minutes prior. I bought my water, which was comparably priced to those in other stores, and moved on."}
{"text":"Staff is rude AF. I've grabbed a few things here different times as I'm always connecting flights in Charlotte. Every time, I get attitude. Sorry you hate your job. I hate flying all day and eating crap prepackaged airport food, but I'm not being a dick. Food sucks and is overpriced. The only reason for going here is when you're starving and there is no time to grab anything else between flights."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. Paid $30 for a sandwich, salad and a cup of fruit, only of which the fruit was edible. Sandwich was tasteless and mostly doughy bread, the Caesar salad had rubbery chicken and damp croutons with limp lettuce. Unfortunately we didn't find out until 30000 ft in the air."}
{"text":"Farmers Market is not a cafe, it's a store, there is nowhere to sit, you grab your snack and go to wherever you need to be.

They sell pre-packaged salads and sandwiches, like hot tuna, made from albacore tuna salad, pickles, tomato, romaine, spicy sriracha aioli, on rye. Also your typical snacks and chips of the Kettle variety, as well as baked PopChips, nuts, pre-packaged popcorn.

To wash it all in, there are health cautious drinks like Naked brand fruit and vegetable juices, Tropicana, Horizon organic milk, coconut water, and sodas like Coke, Dr Pepper, Sprite, Honest and Snapple teas, Gatorade, Monster energy drinks, and FUJI bottled water that I happen to like.

Also saw some fresh fruits of a shelf variety like apples and pears. Overall, I'd say these are way better and healthier options than your regular airport snack stand. An individual carton of organic milk will go a long way in terms of making wise choices while traveling."}
