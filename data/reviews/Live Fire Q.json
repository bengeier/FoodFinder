{"text":"This place is the bomb.  Two of the basic 'meh' things you always see at barbecues, beans and slaw, are actually superstars here.  The slaw, with its vinegarette, is unbelievably good, and the beans reminded me more of the smokey, meaty,  southern black eyed peas than the usual baked beans fare you would get with BBQ.  The tri-tip was cooked perfectly, served plain the way I like it.  I was *pleasantly* surprised.  Thanks, Live Fire Q!!"}
{"text":"Just found this place.  A little tucked away, but totally worth finding.  Bbq is off the hook.  Best Michelada in town.   Wife had smoked chicken taquitos(order envy).  Great place to grab a bite before going to the Galaxy theatre.  If you're looking for that new place, this should be on your list."}
{"text":"It's mediocre Tex Mex, don't expect barbecue. Much too expensive for what it is.  Service is mixed. Food was done quickly, but we got our a appetizer and entrees before our drinks. When the bartender did bring our drinks out, she let us know she had \"more drinks to make,\" as if we were wasting her time, and went back to her guys sitting at the bar.  As a bartender, I get that you need your tips, but every guest matters. My girlfriend got a splash of hot sauce in her eye and as she squirmed in pain, I rushed to the manager for a napkin and, at a relaxed pace, he started back to the kitchen to wash his hand and brushed me off by letting me know he'd bring them to us. Man, it's a NAPKIN. Then about a minute and a half later he came strolling out with the napkin, suddenly remembered that I told him she had HOT SAUCE in her eye, and asked if we needed water. Luckily we had ice water already so we didn't have to wait for that, too. We never were asked if we needed anything else, a check, a to go box nothing.   We WERE REFUNDED without any issue and the Investor (that I believed was the aforementioned manager) was without a business card but nice after my mother (who btw chose this place for her BIRTHDAY) let him know we were dissatisfied.  I won't come back, unfortunately. The service may have been different if the manager was actually here but it's not easy being the boss. He was apparently on a catering job."}
{"text":"Of course my opinion on their food is entirely subjective, but I still think it's absolutely delicious.  Everything is done in a simple way that lets you appreciate the actual taste of the meats they serve.  It's like an ale carte Brazilian steakhouse with only three options of meat and even less sides.  Still, the meats they serve are decadent.  I always find myself coming back to this place, regardless of how many times they screw up my order.  If I'd advise anything it would be to check everything you ordered; chances are something was done wrong.  It's still worth it though.  My only other complaint is that they really need to expand on their menu.  If you look through the pictures here, you'll see things like Prime Rib and Green Chili/Cheddar mashed potatoes, or a side that seems to be a New Mexican version of Succotash... but these are all things they only serve on what seem to be secret days that occur once in a blue moon.  It would be great if I could get my order correct once in a while, and have a large variety of meats and sides to choose from daily."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying the owners food for years!  This new restaurant is half Carlitos and half Live Fire Q all in one.  You can order from both menus at the same time.  Absolutely amazing!  Red Chile margarita is my favorite from the cocktail menu.  I can't pick a favorite  from the food menu because everything is amazing!  Ftom chicken, sausage and tritip to burritos, Navajo tacos and chile rellenos...it's all amazing!   And they serve breakfast all day. You will go back again again!"}
{"text":"Adjoined with Carlitos Burritos Live Fire Q offers some stellar bbq eats. You are able to order off both menus giving a nice vareity of mexican and bbq dishes to choose from. I tried their triple combination plate coming with tri tip, sausage, and chicken also included is a side of slaw, beans and garlic buttered toast. Personal recommendation on the chicken as it was perfectly cooked and moist. Tri tip came in second which came out nice and tender. Sausage was at the bottom of the list as it was a little dry but the rest of the meal more than made up for it.  Overall very satisfied with my experience here and would recommend checking the place out if you have not already."}
{"text":"What kind of barbecue joint doesn't have any barbecue sauce?! This one.  Menu is limited but I guess the meats are good- the tri tip at least was relatively thick cut, pink in the center, and nicely seasoned in the Santa Maria style. It's good, splurge for the half-pound. However, the sandwich consists entirely of meat and dry bread. You can pay to add green chiles and/or cheese (in keeping with the NM theme of the Carlitos menu), but there is no sauce available at all, not even by request.  Cashier was super apologetic about this and mumbled something about it being the chef's choice? If this is done for the sake of authenticity, then a Santa Maria style salsa should be an option instead. As served, the sandwich itself tastes incomplete- good, but plain.   Sides of (ranch style?) beans and a vinegar-based coleslaw were otherwise fresh and amply portioned."}
{"text":"I had the combo plate. Meat was tender and smokey, sausage was snappy and juicy! I loved the slaw, no mayo, but a light vinegar dressing. Perfect! And THOSE BEANS! Can't wait to go back :)  They put a LOT of cheese on their food, so I usually ask for light cheese or none at all.  Service is fast, and servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Walked in and promptly walked out, the lady at the register had her fingers in her nose. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place has always impressed me, from the employees all the way to the quality of the food. The side of beans are much tastier now and I am always impressed with the tri-tip. The bread that comes with the tri-tip could be improved, but overall, always a pleasure. My husband and I regularly come here for great food."}
{"text":"My husband happened to find this little gem last week when we were in green valley, I won't lie I was apprehensive at first.   Let me just warn you, the servings are HUGE and the food is amazing!   I personally always order brisket when given the chance. I didn't care for the cut of brisket it was a little to big, the flavor was amazing though.  The nachos were so good!! Carlito,   Guess this is why it was different than what  I expected    Still amazing like I said"}
{"text":"Bringing two concepts together can be difficult.  But I love the fact that they allowed me to use the smoked tri-tip as the meat for my burrito.  I had a smoked tri-tip burrito with mexican rice, beans, guaq, pico, cheese and red sauce all inside.  Its was perfect! 4.5 stars on the food. Services is walk up style unless you order a drink with alcohol, then they will deliver it.  I wish I didn't have to keep getting up to ask for a napkin.  They should put some on the tables."}
{"text":"I'm from Santa Maria and this is pretty good. I don't think they use red oak but the flavor was still very good. Beans and salsa were great! I will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Somewhere between Santa Maria, California and Albuquerque, New Mexico is Las Vegas, Nevada. It makes perfect sense, then, to find a New Mexican inspired joint paired up with a Santa Maria BBQ joint in Las Vegas Valley.  I grew up in Southern California and attended a church that held an annual Santa Maria BBQ cookout complete with the slow live fire cooked tri-tip. I miss those days so when I found out there was a place here in town specializing in Santa Maria style Q, I knew I had to check it out. Not even a monsoonal type thunderstorm was going to stop me. I fought through the wind and sideways rain just to get my tri-tip on.  When I arrived at Live Fire Q, I saw the flashing sign and a door to the left and in I went. I looked at the menu briefly before settling on the Trio Plate. This came with a spicy Italian sausage, a chicken breast and, of course, the tri-trip. On the side was some garlic toast, beans and cole slaw. I was expecting to eat it there but it was brought to my wrapped and ready as a to-go order. Apparently I ordered from the take-out side. A little tip for you, if you plan to dine in, head to the side entrance on the right and order there.  I eneded up taking my food home which was fine but not expected. I started with the sausage. I'm not always a fan of Italian sausage but this was really good. I loved the spice. I then went in for the chicken. I wasn't too sure about it. It looked pink to me. I don't believe it was under cooked. I think the pink was from the cooking method. It was hot and pulled apart well. But I am paranoid so I saved the chicken for later when I could cook it again for my own piece of mind. The tri-tip was up next and it was perfect. It was moist and tender. Cooked medium and flavored only with a rub of salt and pepper. The beef was allowed to shine through on its own without masking it in sauce. It brought back memories of home. The beans were good with a bit of ground beef and a hint of spice. The slaw was a little different. Purple cabbage, green cabbage and cilantro. CILANTRO! It made the cabbage taste like salsa without the tomatoes. It was very crisp and refreshing. A little bit surprising too.  I got a ton of food from Live Fire Q the other night. Enough for two meals really. As much as I received and as much as I enjoyed the tri-tip, I cannot give above 3 stars at this time. With a confusing entrance and hidden dine-in cashier, questionable (for me) chicken, only four slices of tri-tip, and the fact that it took 20 minutes to receive my order, 3 - 3.5 stars is it today. I will say I plan to come back for a tri-tip sandwich. Lets allow the star of the show shine through."}
{"text":"If you love Carlito's and you love BBQ then you will love Live Fire Q. Of course I've had previews of how good this would be from the Saturday night specials at the old Carlito's location.  Tonight I was finally able to try items from the Live Fire Q menu. I had the Prime Rib with cheddar green chile mashed potatoes, calabacitas, a sausage stuffed mushroom, and red chile grilled shrimp. Yes, read that again and drool. It was even more amazing than it sounds. The prime rib was probably the best I've ever had. I loved the smokiness cooked into the prime rib. The sides were all delicious and I loved the spicy sausage in the mushroom. The red chile on the grilled shrimp was the perfect flavor.   My husband had a Tri-Tip Sandwich which was smothered in melted cheddar and green chiles on a delicious baguette type of bread. I stole a lot more than one bite of this. All of the flavors worked so well together. I really liked the slaw on the side that had a nice cilantro and vinaigrette flavor. The baked beans were not very tender or well flavored, but I didn't even care because everything else was amazing.  The bar menu is now both extensive and unique. I had a red sangria that was a nice sweet sangria. The menu also features mules made with green chile vodka and margaritas made with chiles. Yum! I love that they don't shy away from their chile passion with any of the menu items.  Live Fire Q is describing themselves as Santa Monica style BBQ. I wasn't sure what that was going to mean. To me it seems like a new version of BBQ with some green chile influence. This isn't going to be anything like Texas BBQ or anything similar to that. This is a whole new style.  Great food and unique style!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for dinner. Place was pretty empty as we ordered but was almost to capacity 10 mins later. I ordered the Trifecta plate and everything was really good. My GF ordered a burrito bowl and liked it as well. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Customers we're complaining around me... I thought they may be divas... Oops I was wrong!!! The food I ordered ha a good taste however the waiter was not able to distinguish between a ground beef product from a pulled pork product... Ordered Ground beef got pork... The answer was Oops I put it in wrong.... I can give you one of our signature premix margaritas to make it right.... Hummm not even s top shelf???? OUCH!!!!"}
{"text":"We were trying to find a Mexican restaurant in Henderson & stumbled on this place thru Yelp. We  really enjoyed it.  It's one of those places where you order at the counter & they bring your food. It was much better in that the restaurant area was very inviting, they have a bar (good margaritas) & the food was excellent. Wish they had one by mountains edge!"}
{"text":"Santa Maria, California is credited with a regional delicacy known as the Tri-Tip roast.     Its characterized by  a dry rubbed hunk of sirloin that is basted with a mustard glaze over a very hot fire resulting in its signature \"crust\" on the outside that holds tender, medium rare meat within.   Its traditionally served with Pequinto beans and  garlic bread.  Live Fire Q offers up this delicacy (or say they claim) so I decided to give it a whirl.      On the plus side, the service was friendly and the side items were fantastic.   The headliner of the show, however, was the tri-tip ....and it came up a little short.    It appeared to be slow roasted almost like a prime rib.   There was no crust on the outside which is really where the flavor comes from.    It wasn't bad - but it wasn't the real deal.     I was hoping for more authenticity.  Having said that it was a decent tasting meal at a fair price with friendly people and that counts for something."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my husband. We showed up a half an hour before closing, and the staff was very friendly. I had the enchiladas and a sopapilla, he had the tri tip salad. Both meals were delicious! My husband almost always orders a salad if we eat out during the week with oil and vinaigrette or no dressing which is usually not too exciting, the tri tip was quality and a nice change up for him. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The menu is a blend of BBQ and Tex Mex, but is not great at either. The entrance is not clear, you order in a line without a menu (until you get to the front) and the entire experience is a little awkward. The BBQ was just okay, but it's not a traditional plate if that's what you're looking for (comes with Italian sausage and garlic bread).  On an upside, they have a very fancy drink dispenser."}
