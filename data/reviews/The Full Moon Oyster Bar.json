{"text":"Very good! Excellent seafood extremely fresh. Not everything fried like most seafood places in the south .   Oysters were shucked right in front of you.    Odd setup, but very quaint. No separate tables  its just all bar top, winding bar tops.   Excellent local place to get excellent seafood.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great fresh oysters, wait staff was great. Oysters shucked right in Front of you and they have great selection of oysters, the staff are familiar with the difference in the oysters. It's nice to have a place like this around Concord. There are no tables, all bar top seating."}
{"text":"I love the salmon salad!  The food is good and we've had a good experience with the staff."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service.. I will definitely be going back. They have solid drink specials and the food was wonderful.. Try the Lobster nachos as an appetizer they are well worth it."}
{"text":"The food, the decor, the staff... hands down the best around! Go up there and grab some specialty oysters (jarrett bay are my fav!), crab legs, or one of their many culinary masterpieces (seafood mornay and the shrimp boil are so delicious!)! The drinks are also very very reasonably priced! I'm  Lovin' the moon and I know you all will too!"}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly service from the whole staff and manager.  Great drinks, frosty mugs.  Love the oysters which are great quality.  I completed the Quarter Moon challenge and got a free tie dye shirt, my friends couldn't.   The crawfish and alligator cheesecake is fantastic.  Thanks to Full Moon for accommodating our large group. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have immensely enjoyed my meals at Full Moon in several locations. Food is delish and plentiful. However, my husband and I came down with a nasty case of food poisoning which more than likely occurred from the raw oysters. Just words of warning.  You don't ever want to wind up in the ER with food poisoning caused from seafood. A night of hell."}
{"text":"The chargrilled oysters are amazing. And the bacon wrapped scallops were yummy. And when my son ordered the kids cheeseburger I expected the typical hockey puck burger but it was not overcooked and even had real cheese - not processed. He ate every bite.   Service was great - the way they have things set up the wait staff is always right there.   The only negative is that if you have more than 3 people you can't really talk to each other because all the seating like a bar and the sound level is pretty high.   I'll be back again next week."}
{"text":"I loved the decor, but the food was just okay. I was so bummed for I was looking forward to a great seafood place in the area. The oysters were good,but the other items I had were bland. The staff were excellent. My fingers are crossed that they will get better."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great!!! People here are friendly and punctual!! The oysters were big and bomb!!!!! The crab cakes was real and a big size, definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here 5-7  times, but tonight will probably be the last. The food is good (for the area) but the hostess was ABSOLUTELY rude to us. We were waiting for 2 more to join us (that were from out of town). They got lost and we kept saying \"they got lost but are on the way\". She was absolutely RUDE  saying \"we can't save seats\" and \"I have  regulars waiting\"....ummmm ok! I totally understand about a wait and not holding seats but even after I explained they were lost and only a few minutes away she insisted that \"her regulars\" take priority\". Well I hope \"her regulars\" are worth losing loyal customers and our \"word of mouth\" in this community.  The way she acted impacted the mood of the rest of the evening  (we were so excited about spending with our family).The place, overall, is overpriced for the quality  and area but we have no problem paying the extra for a good restaurant.  The GM, Dennis(?), said don't worry about her... but if he truly is the GM then he should have handled her AND the situation and not allowed her to treat customers without respect and understanding!!  FYI PEOPLE GET LOST (especially when they aren't familiar with the town) , TRAFFIC CANT BE CONTROLLED, and THE UNFORSEEN SOMETIMES  IMPACTS A PLAN....BUT HOW YOU (and your employees) HANDLE A SITUATION CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN WHETHER THEY RETURN OR NOT!!"}
{"text":"I really like the super friendly staff and that they have outdoor seating now. I've tried different things here, and most recently the crab legs today. Unfortunately I ordered them To Go so I didn't realize there was not a bit of Old Bay seasoning on them until I got home. The legs were literally scrawny; the whole pound of them. I was so disappointed after paying $25 for these. I'm better off going back to Outback and Red Lobster for crab legs. I ate what was there and still very hungry - that doesn't happen at other crab leg establishments. Expensive lesson learned."}
{"text":"Great concept and great service! The servers shuck the oysters in front of you.- man they work hard. Good music too"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! They may be a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. The shrimp and grits is amazing and I definitely recommend the crab bread. Best crab legs I have had in a long time as well. Honestly you can't go wrong. The only disappointment for me was I didn't save room for dessert.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Oh and ask for Lindsay, she is THE BEST WAITRESS we have EVER HAD. Can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! Would not let me leave comment under 3 stars or I would of gave a 1 star! Went Tuesday night to all you can eat crab legs & paid $36 per person & it was the smallest crab legs I've ever seen in my life!!! Not enough crab meat to even work for, didn't even matter if it was all u can eat, still eft hungry after 3 different orders & I only weigh 120lbs. I use to go to the Full Moon in Southern Pine NC every Tuesday night & was great but even the service was bad in Concord! Our bill was a little over a $100 & they automatically added $15 gratuity which I had a problem with because the service SUCKED! I Don't have a problem with tipping & normally tip 20% but service was horrible along with the crab legs! If you like crab legs definitely stay away from here!!!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at this establishment. We like the quality of food/value. The two person wait staff last night was rude and mentioned 15 times(as each customer walked in) that they were closing at 8pm, after we arrived at 6:50 to grab some oysters. By the time we were finished eating and paying around 8, many more customers had arrived and when we left at 8:30 they were still apparently serving. The female shucker was complaining  to a customer about having to be at work, even though their intention was to close early. The atmosphere was frustrating while trying to eat and pay attention to the staff wanting to close the restaurant."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a new place in Cabarrus County and to Full Moon Oyster Bar. Now I can truly say, I have never been to an oyster bar and was not sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find a friendly, welcoming restaurant offering a wide variety of seafood entrees along with some beef and chicken specialties.  Dora here. Cozy up to the bar and prepare to know your neighbors. For being a new place in town, this oyster bar filled up fast! If you don't like eating on bar stools, this probably wouldn't be your cup of tea. But we enjoyed the change of pace, and the friendly servers tag team, so your drink never runs out and the food came out fast.   While waiting for our meal, they offered complimentary steamed seasoned potatoes and cole slaw. The potatoes were great, cut into rectangle chunks with skin on, seasoned perfectly with great flavor. The slaw was creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.  For my lunch, I chose the Alaskan Snow Crab, 1-1/3 pounds of steamd snow crab seasoned in Old Bay spice. The crabs were steamed to perfection, tender, very fresh and came with four huge clusters, plenty for a lunch meal. Dora here. To all our male readers. Just in case you were wondering...this much Old Bay changes your facial hair color. lol.  Dora here. Usually I sit across from hubby when he eats crabs. I joke that I'm the one who needs a bibb, not him. Kinda nice sitting next to him this time.  Still Dora. Ernie admitted that, although these crabs were lip-smacking tender and incredibly fresh, the portion doesn't quite compare to Hannah Flanagan's's all-you-can-eat crabs on Sunday evenings. But for those times he's craving crabs and we can't spare the four-hour round trip and the three hours to eat...  Dora again. Check out the Crab Cake sandwich! Ginormous, isn't it? Trust me, there wasn't a crumb left from this sandwich on my plate. Smooth and not too seafoody, which was great because I'm not a huge seafood fan and this was one of a handful of menu items that called out to me. I only took a bite of the creamy potato salad because I scooped up all of that complimentary slaw. Oops.   Still Dora. This place reminds me of Cheers, a local hangout where everybody knows your name. Even though I'm not a seafood fan, hubby is, so we'll be back. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere!!  Definitely a new favorite of mine!!  Btw it is an oyster BAR, you sit at a bar, which is great with me but some folks won't understand."}
{"text":"Finally I have stumbled upon another hidden gem. This place was absolutely amazing! The service was great, and the oysters were no joke! We ordered them seared and we ordered them raw. Either way you can't go wrong. The staff was very knowledge about the menu...not so much about the hot sauces, but I was probably just asking to many questions because everything tasted so good. Keep in mind the majority of seating is bar seating, but that didn't bother us.  They have an alligator cheesecake that is a definite must try for an appetizer. I can honestly say my girlfriend and I have already planned a trip to head back up there to eat dinner, even though its an hour and a half drive. If your from this area and you haven't discovered this place I'm here to tell you, your missing out. Definitely swing by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here after a 4 hour ride from Atlanta! The place was packed and 90% of the seating is bar seating!!   The inside is very decorative. I felt like I was on the coast and the menu is mostly seafood.  The service was great! I ordered the local IPA which was equally great!   The food wasn't very good... They offer complimentary coleslaw and potatoes before your entree. The coleslaw was meh.. but these potatoes were a cross between mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes and French fries. They literally had traits of each! I wasn't impressed.  I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops with pineapple salsa ($13) app as meal with a side house salad ($4) The salad was pretty good! It had candied pecans which was a nice plus!  Now these scallops were awful! The bacon was under cooked and the scallops tasted fishy and like sand.. I sent them back after one bite. If I was sitting at a private table I probably would've spit it out. I tried one of my moms oysters, which was their take on an oysters Rockefeller. Same thing.. fishy and gritty.   I don't think I would go back, but if you live in this area this is one of the only seafood options."}
{"text":"Beer specials today with 3.00 craft beers, lunch deals run till 3 pm.  Salmon is tender, flaky and perfectly seasoned with rice pilaf and asparagus.  They should come with hushpuppies.  The half and half poboy is delicious, but the oysters are never extra hot.... why is that, maybe it is just me.   The mac and cheese side is amazingly creamy and then topped with extra cheese.   Great service, your basically sitting at a full restaurant surrond bar with 80 rock music playing."}
{"text":"Loved it!  We watched and waited for this restaurant to open and we were not disappointed!  We tried the gumbo, crab bisque, Shrimp Po-boy, coleslaw, potato salad, and wonderful steamed potatoes that came with meal.  Everything we tried was served fresh, hot, and tasted excellent.   We'll be back soon.  Only downside is because it's a bar, most seats are high top, not the first choice for many of us older short people."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was incredible! I'm incredibly picky about seafood especially growing up in Miami and the Florida Keys and fishing all the time. Everything was amazing. Watch your portions. We filled up quickly!! Try the house made potatoes and slaw too before your meal. Delicious."}
{"text":"I went here for a nice dinner with some of my family.  We ended up having an appetizer meal.  We had the nachos and quesadilla, it was so good.  I highly recommend this place.  They had alot of great looking things on the menu.  I will go back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The food is always good and service is great. Dennis and his staff are on point! Tuesday's are all you can eat crab n"}
{"text":"Fresh tasty food. Good service and good folks. A little loud. Seating is a bit limited and conversation is tough when sitting side by side around the giant square bar."}
{"text":"First time here. The food and drinks were great! We will be back for sure especially since our shucker was great!"}
{"text":"We had my brother's birthday dinner here tonight and everything from the food to the service was great.  We had steamed oysters, steamed shrimp, and the blue cheese oysters (yum).  I also had a spicy Bloody Mary which was on special for $4.00 (delicious).  Our servers were great!  I loved the atmosphere and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Listen...don't think twice about this place. Just go! I had the crawfish and alligator cheesecake (yes, I know it sounds weird but its savory NOT sweet and sssooo delicious) and the moon rockers (5 HUGE oysters with spinach and cheese, kinda like oysters Rockefeller) and both items were Outstanding!!! They even give you complementary sides of potatoes and cole slaw with all oysters and appetizers.  I basically ordered two small appetizers and had waaaay more than I could eat. I can't wait to go back and try a few other items on the menu. Last but not least, bad customer service is a serious deal breaker for me..And I was a little concerned about the dining experience because of the previous reviews from other yelpers. Fortunately Lindsay and Kenzie were my servers and they were absolutely awesome! Super nice, knowledgeable, attentive but not overbearing. I'll be back and bring a few friends along next time!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here twice. Once for oyster Monday and once for crab Tuesday. Both times were great. Oysters were nice and fat. They shuck them right in front of you. Chargrilled oysters came out beautiful and yummy. Service is a little slow but with how busy they were and the amount of staff it was understandable. Crab legs took a while to come out at first and they were cold and rubbery for the first set. But after that each set came out nice and hot. They soon started coming out faster then we could keep up. We managed with my pro crab leg cracking skills. Although it was a bit rocky at first we made up and were happy with the food at the end. Great great great!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we'll definitely be back. We tried the raw oysters, crab cake, calamari and crab dip. Everything was really good. The oysters are shucked right in front of you.   I was surprised at how busy they were for a Monday. For only being open for five days so far they ran pretty smooth.    I love the set-up of the restaurant...it's all bar seating with a nautical theme.  It's a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"We went for the full moon special with the king crabs legs. It was delicious! The potatoes were excellent. I don't like raw oysters and our waiter recommended to have them half steamed and they were great."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is over the top. Before going, I read the reviews here and was still surprised to see how casual it was.  Bar seating entirely (unless you want to dine outside) but it works and the staff knows HOW to make it work. Groups seated on a corner so everyone can chat.  Couples seated in the middle of the bar.  The most surprising thing to me was how many people wait on you!  You're never looking for a refill on your drink.  We started with scallops wrapped in bacon and they were delicious!   My husband got \"The Full Moon\". OMG!  So much food!!  It really could be dinner for two or take leftovers home. A dozen oysters, clams, shrimp, mussels and crab legs. (I think that's all )  I got the filet mignon. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare. So tender and flavorful.  This was the first of many visits."}
{"text":"This place is consistent. I've been here several times and I'm never disappointed. This last time we ordered the snow crab legs and buffalo shrimp. Both were equally wonderful. This place is one of our go-to places if we are not in the mood to take a chance that night, and are guaranteed great food."}
{"text":"Everyone should be aware that the majority of the seating is around the bar.  They have four tables outside.    The shrimp boil had no flavor.    The shrimp and grits were ok.  The service was great!  The best part of the meal were the side of potatoes.   Maybe if I got the raw oysters I would have a different rating however the seating arrangement and the quality of the food we got would not make me go back and try the oysters."}
{"text":"Best place for fresh seafood in our area. The staff is very nice to customers they know the menu very well and will help you try new dishes. Go early it's busy at normal times but they do great job getting u in."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. From the delicious food to the great service ! I only eat baked oysters and the chargrilled ones i had here were SO GOOD. The manager there actually served me as i was alone and he is probably the reason the place is doing so good. He was super nice and pleasant and even when i made a mistake on my order he fixed it for me without a problem even though i felt bad.  I would say they need a new coleslaw recipe but other than that it's a must try in the area."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but your crab cakes sucked.. they were all bread crumb!! Also the two steaks my parents ordered were cooked totally different (one well and one medium rare) but they both ordered their steaks \"medium\"!"}
{"text":"Seafood. Check. Seafood in landlocked North Carolina? Bonus!  If you have an urge for seafood this is the place. I honestly never liked oysters until we had them at full moon. Add in clams, shrimp, crab and side dishes that make you think you are by the coast? Yum"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely wonderful.    And so is the staff!    Some of the best service we have ever had.   They said there is no turnover which indicates the company values its employees which is a rarity these days.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time. Fantastic! Wish I would have gone sooner. The environment is great. The food is the best you'll get in this area. The only bad thing about it was the wait, about 45 minutes around 7:30 on Friday night. The wait was worth it, so this place still gets five stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"My Dad has been here several times and talked me into joining him this evening. I happen to live about a mile away from Full Moon and have debated giving it a try several times but I've unwittingly put it off until now; boy have I been missing something truly special!  You walk in the door and are immersed in a unique and impressive nautical themed bar. The bar is the highlight, mainly because it is the only seating in the house! A true-one-of-a-kind setup, the bar branches out amongst the whole restaurant and has customer seating on the outside, with bar prep and foodservice/ staff area on the inside. It also has a direct beeline to the kitchen, keeping the goods running smoothly and preventing a patron from running into the staff with steaming oysters in their hands. It looks incredibly efficient!  The food was phenomenal. Me and dad had the seared tuna appetizer with perfectly toasted sesame seeds on top and the Moon Oysters (a play on Oysters Rockefeller) and the topping on these gems was savory, creamy, with a great texture.  For my entree I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. Let me repeat that I live a mile away from this place, I say it again because this was the best shrimp and grits I've ever had, and the place is literally in my back yard!! The grits were perfectly cooked and seasoned, truly noteworthy for an often under-appreciated ingredient. The sausage, shrimp, and tomato worked in tandem with the grits like a world class symphony; savory, spicy, rich, creamy, cheesy, my words fail precisely how elegant this dish was put together! For what it's worth, my dad got the \"Jamaican me crazy\" dish, which I'm assuming is a Rice dish with beef and shrimp, I was too lost in my own entree to give it more than a quick snapshot!  I wanted to also commend the wait-staff for the incredible job they did tonight. You see, sometimes in foodservice business you have to deal with some no-so-great patrons. When we arrived, there was a (seemly impaired) man sitting next to us at the bar with his wife. He was arguing with one of the servers about the size of his oyster entree and was getting pretty angry. Over the course of his stay, I witnessed 3 individual people ask him if he was okay with his order and the first even told him that if he was still hungry that he would get him extra oysters at no charge. At no point did anyone give him even the most-subtle of attitude, they all handled it far better than this man deserved. Normally I wouldn't pass judgement, however the man proceeded to demand the check, paid cash, shorted the restaurant any form of a tip AND shorted the total of his bill, walked out the door and drove off.  I believe its a true show of a restaurant's professionalism and a genuine show that they care about their customers when you get to witness them deal with a less-than ideal situation. You guys don't deserve that, but know that you handled it flawlessly. For whatever loss you incurred from the drunk gentleman, you earned a repeat customer. I just wished I had come sooner! Thanks to Crystal and everyone who made our dinner a full-package experience!"}
{"text":"If you like no frills AWESOME SEAFOOD, this is your place! We had the raw oysters and bacon wrapped shrimp to start and went nuts after that. The Shuckers, or the guys behind the bar, were very friendly, attentive, and fun. There was live music that was quite good as well. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Only been open for about a month and still going through start up mode.problems. Had two gentlemen who tried to serve us which is great unless they don't communicate with each other.  Nice Oyster Bar but the bulk of the seating being bar seating. We chose the bar seating because my wife who is addicted to football wanted a view of the the TV.  It's a good menu with a variety of items in case you don't like seafood like my wife..  I ordered a 1/2 peck of oysters on the half shell, raw of course as my entree with an oyster Po Boy as my entree. Came with a hot potato salad and Cole Slaw. The oysters were big Gulf Oysters, very pump and meaty and while not as salty as some, were very good.  The Oyster Po Boy on the other hand was very bland and did not have any contrast, texture etc to the dish.  The hot potato Salad was excellent and while I don't normally like Cole Slaw because it's made hours before and is a mess by the time you get to it, was actually very good. Very crispy and the way I would make Cole Slaw.  My wife had the turkey burger which they call the Gobbler along with a side of Mac and Cheese. The Mac and Cheese was excellent while the Goobler was very dry. I had a bite of the Gobbler and agree it was very not up to expectations.  Give it time and it will improve but on today's excursion. only counts as an average."}
{"text":"Grate food, drinks and service! Oh me the oysters we're huge!!! I also found a pearl which was awesome!"}
{"text":"Just go. You'll like it. There is a food challenge to win a tshirt--Saltine cracker with a raw oyster, horseradish, Dave's insanity sauce, black pepper. I forgot what it's called and only the brave, trained and insane should try it. Personally I loved it!  The grilled oysters were fantastic too, and probably a better choice for most oyster lovers.  #NCDavidAustin #OysterBar #ShuckEmIfYouGotEm#FullMoon"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere! Amazing food and staff! Feels like you're at the beach when you step in! Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here with the fiancé on an impromptu dinner date. Great food, got the quarter bucket oysters and one and a half pound of head on shrimp (roughly $40 altogether but I think the shrimp was on special). Even better service, though. It's an open concept, two (four? According to my fiancé) horseshoe bars make up the whole place. So if you don't like sitting next to strangers, come when it's slow or not at all. What makes this place the most is the service. Crystal and Beau (Bo?) teamed up to help us out and they were fantastic. They lost our ticket in the kitchen and Crystal and Beau more than made up for it. I would've back for the food regardless, but I'll definitely be back because of the service."}
{"text":"Great food, I had the nachos. My husband enjoyed the shrimp cocktail and some of my nachos. They have a friendly staff. The place was clean with fresh looking decor."}
{"text":"As other Yelpers have pointed out, pretty much bar seating only. There are a few tables inside and they have tables outside. This really is a place to gather around the bar with friends and enjoy beers and seafood. I started with the Blue Cheese Oysters which had great flavor and I could have easily eaten more than 1 plate. Then I had the Low Country Shrimp Boil where the shrimp which was good but I wish it has a bit more spice to it. It was tasty but I like my boils with a little bit more heat. The oysters I saw that other patrons ordered were of good size and they seemed to enjoy them. The dishes I saw all looked amazing, too. The staff is really friendly and fun to talk regardless how busy they get. Definitely worth stopping in and giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Food was fresh and tasty. Large oysters!  Worth the drive from any where in the greater Charlotte area or even Rock Hill.  The combo for two had perfect proportions.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow! We were in town visiting for a night and glad we came across this place! Our boy Connor was awesome! The oysters were fresh and on delicious. Actually, everything he recommend was delicious! Crab dip, steamed clams and king crab legs!!! I'm definitely coming back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Paid our first visit there last week. Very pleasantly surprised...excellent service (Our server/bartender was Courtney), and good, fresh seafood nicely presented. You MUST try the Roasted Oysters. It's a tiny tad pricey, but well worth the trip. We are already planning a return visit-with friends. (PS: Good beer list, too:-)"}
{"text":"This is the second time my wife and I have had to leave this restaurant. The shame is that their food is very good, but when you are seated at the bar neither my wife or me could move our elbows, and we're not plus sized. If you are going to spend $75-$100 for dinner for two you would expect enough room to enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"First time here was spring or summer of last year ('17) & loved it all, I earned the shooter challenge shirt, crab cheesecake appetizer was different but memorable, great sides, & we LOVED the sizes & freshness of the oysters so of course we feasted on a ton! Our really nice & mature (age as well as manners) servers were marvelous who informed us All You Can Eat Crab Leg Tuesday Special were something in the $32-$38 range, they were very accurate that day but admittedly my memory just fails to recall exactly. I do remember you could upgrade to $50 for Dungeness & King crab but we only like Snow crab. I was happy to treat my family to a very overdue special occasion with this offer yesterday.  Here's the difference, I learned that it is now $50 each & you will be served a bowl of round about answers if you kindly ask why, which still isn't clear. My fault for not asking prior right before but assuming things stay the same is obviously not accurate & this wasn't entirely my plan. So anyway you should get shrimp and corn with your basket but my son's father didn't have shrimp so he asked for it later. 2nd round we agreed that they can bring us 2 big baskets for the 6 of us to share, of course that meant less servings than initial basket but more will come so that's fine. Personally some of the meat was dried out and some not easy to break like crab legs should be when cooked well but I was ok bc the corn gave me a little bit of variety to overlook that. The shrimp was not great to me but everyone else liked it, the corn was crunchy and sweet not the best but I appreciate the option so by 3rd round we agreed to kindly ask for more. It eventually comes out, shrimp had to come out later which annoyed my son's father a bit bc he had to ask for the shrimp again. Corn was missing so our guy goes back and checks & a good bit later says something along the lines of \"we should go back there & cook it ourselves.\" I'm pretty sure only I heard it while everyone else was happily eating but I was next to my 1 yr old son & didnt want to respond with anger. Plus we never got them.  I had a family member come last year when it was the $30 something too. The issue with her is she & her significant other (who has also worked in a seafood restaraunt) had to wait a long time to be seated when they came first than the people that actually got sat & gave no explanation. You're going to make a interracial couple feel very uneasy & mistreated when the restaraunt is structured off of a first come first serve bases.   My son's father brought my traveling veteran brother out here for a treat after I raved about the oysters, only for him to have been disappointed that they were so small. So there's inconsistency issues here, sure possible chance for maybe out of season but they cost the same so maybe the business can make some sort of incentive for that? We live in Charlotte, it's not that convenient to drive all the way out here to find that out.  Summary: $50 a pop (the highest I've been to) but please don't ask for corn, they don't want to give you anymore than the 1 in your first basket. You'd think that request is small & simple but apparently it's not. Your Tuesday special will come with a side of slick & cup of rude as shuck whether you ask for it or not. They're that generous bc all these younger workers bopping around there act like that, except for one who looked the youngest and was the sweetest; then the other was bipolar polite, which was just odd & the rest just had resting you know... I'm not sure what happened to the first ladies we had but we miss them so much. Thanks Lamont for the free forgotten drink, that was nice but I didn't deserve that kind of disrespect. I use to love telling everyone about this place & be really excited for myself when I could make it back, but I'm one displeased mother shucker after this baffling experience."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner of crab legs and oysters. The crab nachos were amazing. Want to go back for the all you can eat crab legs and shrimp on Tuesdays. We sat outside and enjoyed the evening. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good food and a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty good oyster bar. Good selection, fast service, and awesome punk/rock music. My only criticism is that when my friends did the Quarter Moon challenge and won free tie-dye shirts, the servers didn't notice or say anything and even had to be reminded at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"This review is for those who think they can do an AYCE Snow Crab meal.   It is $50, but lately they have been running a special for three pounds for $38.   While in theory, you will think you can eat three, four, five pounds of crab, that is actually a lot of crab.   The three pound plate is huge, which I am a big guy, I know I can eat a lot, but with each pound I put down, I go slower and slower until I tap out.  We went with the AYCE Snow and Dungenous Crab.   My wife and I to some extent shared, we didn't want to take advantage of the spot, but having said that, we had never had Dungenous Crab.   It just changes it up a little.   Both crabs have subtle tastes.     Both were excellent, and as far as I could tell, they were NOT frozen.  The meals are served with large and tasty peel and eat shrimp, potatoes and coleslaw.   The shrimp are spiced with Old Bay, which comes off as you peel them.  LoL.    Ample dipping butter is supplied.    This is our third time eating there and have yet to have a let down meal.  The seating is different, bar style, but it is fun to chat with your neighbor.   The service is always on par.   Overall a great place for a date night.   Bonus, they serve local kraft beer on tap and have nightly drink specials."}
{"text":"We have been to both the Clemmons & Concord locations. Concord is a little bigger and has outdoor seating. As far as food and drinks both are incredible! The oysters and clams are truly fresh, you think they just came out of the ocean. Their shrimp and grits is packed with flavor and spice from the sausage. They have rotating fish dishes that are made to order and always fresh. I love their potatoes to start off and then their hearty and meaty New England Clam Chowder! I could eat here everyday! Full bar available also!"}
{"text":"We had mid afternoon meal hear after reading the reviews on Yelp. They did not disappoint!  For appetizers we had the Ahi Tuna bites and stuffed mushrooms, for main course we had charbroiled oysters and dozen half raw oysters. They shucked the oysters right in front of us. The setting was exactly like it sounds. Great Service, Great food and will definitely be back when we come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Kinda sorta good. Went for oysters; wasn't impressed with the Chargrilled (house) oysters.  The garlic scallops have a good flavor. The potatoes are phenomenal. Coleslaw - a bit iffy.   So glad we stayed for the homemade dessert. Butter Rum and Banana Pudding...oh my goodness!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service and food were great. I had the King and Snow Crab Nachos which was good. My husband had the Jamaican-Me-Crazy, which I tasted and I think I'll get that next time cause that was delicious. My nephew had the buffalo shrimp, a bit spicy which I like. I think that would've been a good appetizer. Drinks were so good! They have well drinks for $4 on Fridays. I suggest you try this place. I'll definitely be back. Sorry forgot to take pics too hungry"}
{"text":"Been 5 times now, enjoy the food, enjoy the atmosphere but it smells EXTREMELY like seafood. I understand 100% that it is a seafood restaurant, but I go to seafood restaurants all the time and I have never walked in and felt like it smacks you in the face and like I'm going to smell like it when I leave. Other than that I love it!! Recommend everyone to try it out!"}
{"text":"Great place in Concord for seafood, to start we enjoyed the Monday oyster special 85¢ local oysters raw or steamed, $1.50 if you want them charbroiled. We each ordered the three different styles to help decide which one we liked best and then ordered more. They were fantastic.  To change it up a bit we order the boiled shrimp with Old Bay seasoning yummy.   Another special on Mondays is Bud Light or Yuengling pitchers for $7, there were 4 of us so we had 3 pitchers."}
{"text":"the Moon Rocks were the best I've ever had! mom had the Low County Boil, I sampled it and it was as good as anything I've had in New Orleans!  our servers, Denis, Lamont and Bre were phenomenal! also... we will definitely be back!!! (it was my first time, mom's second... if mom likes it, it's REALLY GOOD!) can't wait to try everything on the menu! just love the bar seating and atmosphere! #teamFred"}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood resturant hands down.  I had the chargrilled oysters. The staff was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. The atomoshere was great. Its bar style eating. I will definitely be frequenting this place"}
{"text":"***updated review : Walked in tonight and the place was crowded as expected. It was just me and my man, so we weren't expecting the wait to be as long as it was.. but that was the most minor issue of the evening. It's been about 8 months since we've been here, but things have changed and not really for the better. The friendly waitstaff that were here, are here no longer. Instead we're greeted by a very bored and agitated hostess who couldn't tell us when or how long it might be before we could get seated. When we finally got our seats about 45 minutes later,the girl who was  \" taking care of us\" barely spoke to us. When she did it was apparent that service was merely an afterthought as this was the most inattentive and inhospitable waitress I've ever been privileged to deal with. Service was slow..really slow. Our bottle of wine came with 2 dirty glasses which I had to point out otherwise we would have been putting our lips on other people's dirty mouth smudges. We ordered a dozen raw oysters which were shucked at a good pace.. At this time 4 people had come and sit down in our bar section. We noticed that they had been givin their appetizers and we're already scarfing it down by the time we were done with our oysters. Fine.. However...when we used to come here, the potatoes and coleslaw would  come out first before anything else. Our waitress had forgotten this part apparently. Again.. Fine.. Even though a little irritating since I remember how this place used to operate. Then the main course came in and they gave my plate to the woman sitting about 4 Seats away to my left and gave my date his plate. We looked perplexed at the waitress who had just givin my plate to other girl but she didn't notice. After one of the waitresses who was obviously wasn't ours ( because she disappeared for quite a long time) realized this, they took the plate from that girl and gave her the plate she actually ordered after she had taken several bites from it. At this point, one other boy who was also helping out this particular section saw the mistake and apologized his ass off... Even though the fault was not his at all. He offered to have the fish cooked again for me this time but at this point i wasn't even interested in eating anything more from here. We refused the fish and decided to close out the ticket instead. the most disappointing part was the lack of recognition of the screw up and/or filthy glassware by any member of management or even our own waitress who didn't seem to give two shiiiiiiiitz about it. At this point I'm not sure if a return visit would even be worth it. I just downgraded my 5 star rating of this establishment to 3 stars and that's only becuase the wine stayed cold for the duration of our meal, and the one boy who offered to bring out a new plate.     ***original review: What a gem among this small community that is without a doubt, overlooked. Awesome food. Attentive service...this place is going on our regular Monday rotation.  Full moon is tucked away at the corner of a shopping center ( look for publix). When you walk in it your greeting by a hostess who can seat you pretty much wherever you wish, though most of the room is set up in a circular type bar. There is one table toward the back with a lower table which can accommodate wheelchairs, walkers, or kids.  Noise level is fairly mild between 5 and 8, after that the sound seems to kick up a few notches from louder and louder conversations as the volume of patrons goes up.  It's a mixed crowd in here... From the old fogies to the young whipper snappers  and anyone& everyone In between. Complimentary diced potatoes and fresh coleslaw is complimentary with any order. Wahoo! And  Oysters are shucked in front of you, if you sit at the ends of the table. Obviously pretty neat since this is generally done behind the magic curtain.  So if you're not interested in watching a football game playing on one of the 4 flat-screens above the bar, you can watch your waitress open your little fine delicacies with masterful nimble fingers and a steel rod.  I highly recommend the fried catfish. This dish is so expertly prepared, the shell on the fish is perfectly crunchy and fish is flaky and flavorful. Seasoned steamed asparagus and rice topped with a creamy Chipotle cream sauce  compliments the meal perfectly. I could help myself to four more servings of this, it's that good. If you have a hankering for Sea bass, this is the place you want to come.  We've only been here twice but have had outstanding service both times. Everyone is quick to pitch in and help out but Brie is so far our favorite waitress. I can believe that not alot of people know about Full Moon oyster Bar yet, but I'm sure with the quality this place keeps producing, it won't be long before it's another establishment that's also becomes other people's favorite Monday  hangout."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and had agreed to go with my friends after I saw that they had a veggie burger. I overlooked that it was on the lunch menu but still asked if I could order it. Unfortunately they wouldn't make the exception. They offered a pasta without seafood on it but I just wasn't feeling it. We ended up leaving and finding somewhere else to go. I'm sure the seafood is good if you like seafood, but it was a little frustrating that they couldn't put a veggie patty on the grill. Definitely won't be coming back just because it's not a place I can eat."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 4 times. Overall I really like the concept and its adorable. The menu has a nice selection of standards and differentiated items. The prices are on point for seafood but a little high for some items like scallops. A few of the items like the dip and shrimp and grits border on being too rich to enjoy the full portion and the shrimp were not seared or sauteed just poached so not as well executed as it could be - but it does taste good. Small selection of Virginia oysters (and thankfully no warm water ones!)  that are deliciously grilled. They provide an overly generous portion of a hot potato gratin before the food arrives that doesnt quite make sense and is a bit too rich as well...not sure why ...seems awkward. The cakes are really super yummy and service has been good."}
{"text":"The best seafood in the Concord area large and awesome snow crab. All seafood was fresh and well sized. The slaw was a creamy kind not vinegar."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and grits. Presentation is nice. Generous portion of shrimp with chunks of andouille sausage over grit cakes smothered in a sauce.  Shrimp overcooked and rubbery, grits have no texture and are mushy, sauce lacks flavor, the andouille sausage has a bite as it should.  The Hubby got a Half Moon platter. He reports all was steamed well.  It is bad when I push mine away and start eating off his platter.  Next time...if there is a next time...I will stick with the steamed items and not order a dish from the kitchen.  The staff was very nice and attentive.  They did take the shrimp and grits off the bill as it was hardly touched."}
{"text":"Gave this place 1 more try from the last time and it has gotten worse. Staff is very rude and food was terrible. Voiced the complaint and manager had a careless attitude about it. Will never return."}
{"text":"We arrived late afternoon... 4:30 or so. It took a few minutes to get a menu and the attention of a server. We started with beers and the Snow Crab Nachos. Great for an after noon snack. We finished the nachos and waited patiently to order the rest of our meal. Again, it took some time to get our server attention. We followed with the Seafood Combination plate and we opted for steamed shrimp and raw oysters. We've done this before so we were excited. While the food was great and arrived promptly, I do have to say the service was awful. Our server was disengaged and never asked if we were okay or needed anything. He shucked our oysters in silence and didn't describe where they came from and never made eye contact. We had to ask for melted butter and horseradish from another server, who cleared our empty glasses. It appeared to be the shift change, obvious to any guest surrounding the bar. We overheard him tell another server he had to get out of there. We continued eating and eventually, asked for the check half way through the meal because we could tell he wanted to leave and that made us uncomfortable.  We could see him staring at how much food we still had to eat and how full our drinks were from across the room.  I have been a server in many establishments, from corporate to privately owned, I understand your shift is coming to an end and wanting to leave but the quality of service should still be in tact! I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but I can't look past the many things that made our meal less than desirable! As he returned my credit card to end our meal, he didn't bother to ask how our meal was, say 'We'll see you next time,' or even 'Thank you.' I left feeling very displeased because we have been here multiple times and have always had great service. This ruined my appetite for this establishment."}
{"text":"Un-be-frickin amazing!  WOW. Oysters on point and variety available. Clams tender and delicious. What a platter of shrimp and grits!  And (drumroll please) a crawfish alligator cheesecake made entirely in house. You're welcome!  Saw a mile high pile of snow and king crab nachos - unbelievable. Try it all!  Don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"A total favorite of mine.  Oysters are on special Mondays, Crab legs $Thursday 36....3pds."}
{"text":"We got the full moon entree and shared between the two of us. Crab legs, clams, oysters, mussels, shrimp, and scallops! Oysters were shucked for us. All tasted very good. Came with potatoes which were delicious. Bloody Mary's made correctly!"}
{"text":"Absolutely would recommend Full Moon.   I adore steamed oysters. These folk will do them light, medium or well.  1/2 price on Mondays!"}
{"text":"I found my place.  I have been looking for an oyster spot and I kept getting close but missing.  This is the place I have been looking for.  I would focus on the oysters.  I got mine raw but they have great options such as a new Orleans style lightly grilled with garlic butter, parmesan, and bread crumbs.  Run don't walk to this place if in Concord."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on Friday and ordered the fish special. 2 pieces of delicious cod and fries for $9. The fries are okay but they are battered which is not my favorite. The fish was the star as it was freshly flash fried and flaky. This place was surprisingly busy. I like the classic rock too. However, there are no booths, just all bar seating. I don't care for that setup but the food made up for the seating."}
{"text":"So much yum. Came here for Sunday lunch date on Opening Day for the $4 Bloody Mary special plus baseball.  Started with the bacon-wrapped scallops which were A.MAZ.ING.  I had the oyster poboy which was worth every carb. DH had the Jamaican-Me-Crazy and gave thumbs up to the spice level and tenderness.  All seating is bar seating so it is great for a small group as long as you keep to your personal space.  We'll be regulars."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Fresh seafood and atmosphere! Great place to meet with friends. The staff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"OMG! Love this place. Awesome oysters. Take some money with you because you will eat oysters till you drop. Have a margarita too :)"}
{"text":"Can not believe a good oyster bar this far inland. My first visit will certainly not be my last. Steamed shrimp and oysters were some of the best I have ever had. The waiter was top notch, very helpful, informative and attentive. They shuck your oysters which was nice. Cant wait to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight for the first time.  The food was amazing.  Having lived in Florida, I have eatten my share of oysters and crab legs.  These were the best I have had.  If I was reviewing the food alone, I would give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the service was horrible.  I had to ask for my side dishes twice from two different people.  The waitress took my drink order and never came back with it.  This is ironic as this restaurant's seating surrounds the bar.  The lady who shucks the oysters was amazing and I wish she was my server.  I would like to come back but the wait staff needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to visit here for lunch yesterday.  It was a beautiful day so we decided to sit on the patio. We both loved the blue outdoor furniture and music coming from the outside bar. We share grilled oysters and let me tell you, they were awesome!! I will be getting them again! I also ordered the grilled tuna sandwich. It was so tasty. I didn't know the potatoes and cole slaw came as a starter. My favorite was the coleslaw. I ate it all up and my friend loved the potatoes. She ordered the salmon salad. We had a wonderful time talking on the patio and I guess we lost track of time because the waiter came out and apologized for the time it took to bring our food and said our drinks were being comped because of the time. We didn't even notice it had been a while. All the food was great! It may be my new \"go to\" spot!"}
{"text":"This is the only place around Charlotte where I was able to find \"fresh\" oysters, except for Bentley's on 27. I can afford Bentley's once a year, but I can afford Full Moon weekly! They have the best, freshest & greatest selection of oysters around (Gulf-LA, NC, VA, CT). The staff are friendly, but sometimes they get a deluge of customers and are swamped. We've eaten here about 6 times in the past 3 months."}
{"text":"Great oyster spot! Huge gulf oysters.  Cold beer with quaint local feel.  Waitstaff were nice enough- but attentive to some patrons more than others. Would be great place but need to balance treatment of new and old customers."}
{"text":"Good food and good drinks. My only wish is for it to be bigger. The seating is tricky so come early."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! Great atmosphere! The food is wonderful!!!! Fresh oysters shucked right in front of you. We had the best time and it's always a treat to have a really good fresh seafood bar in your city! Concord needed a Full Moon Oyster Bar! Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"in aggreeence with another reviewer.   the hostess is off the chain    she literally told me I could not seat myself.   had me stand up  then tell me I could sit back down in the same seat.    there was no line and several bar seats available.   total lack of common sense.            the food is great    but the servers don't know who's taking care of who   and things/people  go overlooked.   really hope the owner reads these reviews and adjust the kinks.      this is a really cool place.   wish there were more outside shaded seating"}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious seafood that isn't deep fried this is your go-to spot. We always order the full moon and an appetizer. The last time I went in the cooks went nuts with the Old Bay (or some spices not 100% sure) and it was overkill. We will be back though because now we know to say no Old Bay or very light. The alligator cheesecake is ridiculously good. The calamari is superb. The wait staff is friendly and the wait times aren't absurd even with a full house. Local treasure! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been here several times and have never had a bad experience (except the time they closed early unexpectedly). This is not your typical restaurant. So, there is bar seating only, the chairs go all the way around with bar, which is cool, because you may end up talking to people you don't know and having a great conversation! It's like everyone is dining together.   The menu is awesome, so any delicious items to choose from. My favorite is the garlic shrimp for sure. They also have fabulous drinks and terrific daily specials. The dinners come with potatoes and cole slaw, my advice is skip both and have a $5 side salad--AMAZING! A lot of people love the potatoes, but I wasn't a fan.   The staff is always helpful and friendly. They shuck the oysters for you, which I love. You can order them cooked however you desire and can order as many as you want, no rules! So if I want two oysters, I get two oysters.  Highly recommended restaurant!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Like previous yelpers mentioned, the majority of the seating is bar seating which can be awkward, especially if your bringing small children.  Food: Nothing to be too excited about. I ordered the Jamaican jerk steak/shrimp dish which was actually pretty good. Had the perfect amount of spice while maintaining a good flavor. I think I had the best dish as my wife had crab cakes which were unseasoned and bland. Wife diagnosed them as being a little heavy on the bread crumbs.    Service: Sloooooooowwww! As others mentioned, the bartender/waiter setup is a mess. Each waiter is confused on who's doing what, causing loooonnnng delays. We waited for about 45 min to receive our food which is pretty outrageous considering there weren't that many people there.  The main thing I didn't like was that they pretty much tell you what sides you'll have with your entree. Potatoes & cole slaw. What if I want a side salad instead? Would I be charged extra? I didn't ask in fear of the waiter disappearing and not seeing her/him, or whoever for the next 20 minutes, delaying my order even more.  Overall, not a terrible place but with two small children, the seating and the slow service made for a long night in which the quality of the food did not offset the inconveniences. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Had a dozen Chargrilled Oysters and clam chowder soup. They serve coleslaw and steamed seasoned potatoes  with that also. They have a great selection of beers and mixed drinks. The place is decorated very well. The staff is great and quick to serve, very friendly. We will make this a regular place to eat for sure"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday for the first time. Took hubby, and two daughters. One ordered blackened Salmon, one ordered the shrimp boil and hubby and I had a peck of oysters lightly steamed. Everyone left happy and full. Amazing staff, oysters were perfect...even ordered more to share with daughters. Loved this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always great customer service and great food!! Bartenders are very attentive and anticipates your need. Love the bar step up."}
{"text":"Oysters were good, but pricy for Oyster Bar and this time of year. This Shrimp and Grits needs work and the Low Country boil go ahead and take the heads off the shrimp it detracts from the enjoyment and doesn't add anything to the dish. Over all I thought the service was great, oyster's enjoyable, beer cold, the rest of the food needs some work. Some others commented bland but it's really just sort of nondescript.  Would go again for oysters."}
{"text":"Would love to give them five stars because the food is that good. Unfortunately the service isn't as good as the food. They use a multiple server approach and both times we have been here the waiters are having to check to see if someone else brought something. Having one person forget you is bad, having three people ignore you is worse."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  King crab legs were really good. The shrimp wasn't because it was so greasy. But, the fresh fish of the day looked yummy. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is good, we tried several items off the menu and they were great . The service on the other hand has a lot to be desired . Very inattentive drinks empty for 10-15 min at a time even though the server is taking an order right beside you. I even sat the glasses on the edge of the bar and still nothing . Go for the food , not the service because it's not a priority ."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I did not have the oysters since I have an allergy. We had snow crabs and they were wonderful. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food."}
{"text":"The place was nicely decorated, but lacked regular seating. All seats are bar seats, which means you are coming with a party you are sitting at a bar. Not a big fan of that, and the seats were not very comfortable.  I ordered the char broiled oysters and the husband got the shrimp and grits. Im going to be honest with this review.  The Char-oysters felt that they were rushed to be cooked. Not as tender as you should have for an oyster that was char-broiled, I have gone to several restaurants all around the country and I felt that these were overcooked. They also had a weird fluid (lighter) taste to them. ($20)  Husband got the shrimp and grits and honestly there is nothing really special about them and for 18 bucks, felt like a rip off. He got maybe 8 normal sized shrimp and grit cakes under the sauce.  The drinks were fantastic, but overall food wise (Since we didn't indulge on the all you can eat crab legs or the more expensive meals) seems not worth the deal. Some folks seamed to really enjoy it, but first time and last time for us.   Suggestions:  Have tables and not bar seats for everyone. not everyone could be accommodated for these type of seats. There was a small area with chairs but already was taken by a family and two kids. (should have been reserved for handicapped) since those were the only 3 seats (not in a bar)  in the place.   For the smaller dishes, offer other things as sides. Maybe I missed them but are not easily seen on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, atmosphere.  Really a cool vibe with excellent servers and every option u can think of for oysters.  Would love to have some outdoor seating, which apparently is maybe coming this spring//summer"}
{"text":"Honey Hole if you love oysters and fresh seafood! Chris is the bomb server!  I'm from out of town, great joint- respect Concord!"}
{"text":"First time ... and Wow... ahhhhhmazing!    The Oysters were so fresh and so incredibly yummy!  Followed by the bacon wrapped scallops.. so good!  For entrees, my boyfriend loved the  Sea bass and I loved my steamed shrimp.  Friendly service but a wee bit on the slow side.. I think our server had too many tables or his section was too big.   Just a minor thing to us, as we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!   It's a true oyster bar with only high top seating around an actual bar-no private tables. You can chat with your neighbors and meet new people while enjoying the best, freshest oysters around.   We usually add the crab nachos to our dinner.  The servers work in a team style manner so you are never left without what you need.  Oysters are shucked right in front of you.  This is definitely one of our last minute go to places!"}
