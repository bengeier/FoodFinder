{"text":"Bad, avoid this restaurant! Awful and rude service. Mauvais, évitez ce restaurant! Un service horrible et brutal. This is truly the worst restaurant I have ever visited. My recommendation is that you spend your money somewhere else. There are tones of good restaurants all around Montreal, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Da Vinci serves great food - designed with style and served with professional flair.   The prosciutto with parmesan (and 25 year old olive oil) was so good that I had to just had to pause and savor the flavor.  I had linguini with shrimp, lobster, clams and scallops.  All cooked to perfection.  The atmosphere is excellent.  The people were friendly and unobtrusive.  I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation."}
{"text":"Holy wow! Ok... I had spent a good week wining and dining in Montreal and our concierge recommended this place for a great Italian meal. Though I found that most of their dishes were not truly authentic (being Italian and all), I was still impressed by their presentation and how fresh the food tasted. Their tomato and mozzarella salad was to die for! It tasted as if the tomato was picked right off the vine and their buffalo mozzarella nearly melted in my mouth, bursting with fresh flavor. I had their stuffed shrimp with crab on top of risotto for my main course. The risotto was a tad bit undercooked but the shrimp was exquisite in flavor which completely made up for that minor detail.  The waitstaff was superb. Allowing us to enjoy every course of the meal and keeping our wine glasses filled (you will be quite intimidated by their wine list... bottles ranging from $45- $1000), they were attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was elegant and romantic (bring your date here!!!). We went on a Friday night and were surprised that the restaurant wasn't packed at all. But in my opinion, I would rather come when there's less people to fight for a table.   Overall, my experience here was great and I would most definitely eat here the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"One of the most amazing dining experiences I've ever had! The atmosphere, the food, and service were exceptional. Our waiter, Levi, was incredibly attentive and met every single need/want for the evening. He spent time getting to know what we liked and did not like and made recommendations for us based on what he learned. It wasn't just Levi who was personable and professional. The entire staff was working together like a well oiled machine and helped make the experience wonderful! So thank you everyone at Da Vinci...you made a dinner into a highlight for our trip. If you could not tell, I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but overpriced. For similar type of food and crowd, I would go to Bis(located on de la Montagne) or Beatrice for the younger crowd. The restaurant caters for an older crowd, but is nice for special events when you don't want an overcrowded restaurant.  I was disappointed with my creme brûlée, the caramel crust was not thick enough and I've had better.  Good place, good food but would not particularly go back.  (if you are a foodie, this is not the place for you)"}
{"text":"We had an amazing time.  The food was great and our server, Lavi, made the entire experience enjoyable.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our group of 6 was really looking forward to a seemingly wonderful dinner here based on others reviews of the food.   The problem is we waited for 20 minutes for someone to even let us know what the status was with our 9pm reservation.   Everyone that was waiting ahead of us was seated and we were still kept waiting as the staff zoomed past with no acknowledgement that we were all still there.   We decided to leave and try our luck elsewhere and were fully satisfied with our next restaurant choice.   Frustrating that our reservation was not honored but maybe i'll try to give it a shot again soon wth a smaller party."}
{"text":"After not having lived in Montreal for over a decade, we went to celebrate our wedding anniversary at Da Vinci's last Saturday night. The food was OUTSTANDING, the lambs chops were cooked to perfection and the surf and turf was amazing. Thanks Vince and the rest of the staff for making this a memorable evening for us. We will be back Rene and Norma"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food are both worth having. For people visiting Montreal like I was, this place gives you a good feel for relaxed, flavorful, and classy Montreal Dining experience under the same roof."}
{"text":"If you're looking to woo someone on romantic date, this is the spot.   Everything here is perfection, from the service to the food to the decor (well, from my two visits).    On our latest visit, our coats were taken up arrival, and when seated, we were served a small plate a cured meats, cheese, and bruschetta. I had the table d'hôte, and ordered the buffalo mozzarella, tomato and prosciutto salad. The prosciutto was nicely crisped and set atop the tomatoes and cheese.. yum!  I also had the risotto with shrimp and crab - it was creamy and flavourful (my boyfriend had the steak and lobster tail). Everything was delicious! For dessert, we had the cannoli/creme brule duo - I loved the combination of creamy creme brule and crisp cannoli!   The only downside is being automatically served bottled water that you didn't ask for, and being charged $9 a bottle. Other than that, highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's a very old classical, romantic restaurant. However....  1) as soon as we sat down, waiting for a few people to arrive.. we didn't have a waiter coming to our table and asking us if we wanted to start off by a drink.:. I mean water could be nice.. after 30 mins he came and we asked for water .. he poured each one of us , a quarter of water in each cup. I mean come on it's TAP WATER! 2) the service was really slow. And it wasn't even packed. It took us another hour to order our dishes.  3) I ordered the gnocchi, which was very good ( also why I put a 3 stars and not a one.. the food there was excellent, all of us enjoyed it- I'm getting too distracted) however my food was cold. I didn't wanna be over tight, so didn't say anything until I heard another friend say the same thing. Told the waiter and gave me a huge bitchy face.. he didn't seem very pleasant with my comment. He's like the plate is warm though, but that doesn't mean the food is...  4) my highlight of the night is someone got engaged. It was so cute!!!  Overall food is actually good but service is horrible."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I love the Brownstone building, two levels of dining. Staff is amazingly friendly, and very helpful. Dined here one night it was so crowded, they seated us upstairs in a closed section so we could relax and eat. A real family feel to this place, the entrees are superb (they even give you free chef tastings) and the tiramisu is the best I had ever tasted. Check out the self cleaning toilet seats in the bathroom. This place is a real treat!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Went for dinner and the ambiance was romantic. Our dinner started off with amuse bouche and bread. We ordered the calamari and pastas. All very delicious, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service.  I think that you need to be a table that really keeps ordering bottle of wine after wine. We were completely ignored for 25 minutes after our main course. At that point we flag the waiter. They did apologized, but it was too late. They probably dont look at yelp, so my comment wont get to them."}
{"text":"Des plats italien classique et excellent ! Un endroit parfait pour satisfaire une envie de pate! Nous avons essayé aussi en entré le carpacio de boeuf et la buratta ( fromage cremeux servis avec des tomates ! ) est c'etait excellent ! Le restaurant est magnifique et le service est extraordinaire !   Par contre, c'est un peux dispendieux, 180$ avec le pourboire pour 2 entrés , 2 repas, un dessert et deux verres de vin ! C'est donc un endroit à aller pour de grande occasion, de plus les portions sont tres genereuse :)  Nous sommes allé un mardi et c'etait très bruyant, je ne sais pas si c'est toujours comme cela !"}
{"text":"The food was good, but a bit overpriced. Our waiter seemed really nice at first but eventually got excessively theatrical (almost like he had a script), that got a little weird/annoying. Besides that we had a great evening."}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Great service, great food, friendly staff... Would recommend this for sure. Waiter gives great advice on apps/main/wine combinations."}
{"text":"Every time it is a pleasure for the senses. Fresh and home made gnocchis (ricotta); burrata, mozarella di Bufala - so fresh, moist and soft; my boyfriend had the lamb and beef carpaccio - tender, cooked to perfection, and carpaccio was just melting in his mouth w the perfect amount of parmesan... Good thing is that you can ask for half portions of pastas. Service : excellent. The waiters make you feel important."}
{"text":"Excellent.  First thing I noticed was how incredibly beautiful the interior was. I was really tempted to take pictures of it... my uncle advised against it.  It's been awhile since my visit, so I'm not sure how much I remember. My entree was a mushroom risotto - it was very nice. I don't remember what my appetizer was, but I remember really liking it.  Sorry, my review isn't very helpful because it's been so long! But I remember, at the very least, that it was exceptional, and I look forward to visiting again (and writing a decent review) the next time I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I had such a great time in this restaurant.  the service is beyond amazing (best I've ever had) & the food is very good, the lamb-chops are super tasty and so are the scallops with mango and fennel.   We left giving a BIG tip & smiling from ear to ear.  It goes without saying we will be back.  One minus is that you get charged for water ($8.50), so I won't be getting that next time."}
{"text":"Seeing that I'm not a fan of Italian food [I know, crazy]--this place was A+.  The place was empty and the atmosphere was a little bleak but the waiter was attentive and the food was excellent. I ordered an 'off-menu' item: risotto with porcinis and truffles: perfect, perfect. My lovely date had something similar to pasta carbonara, except it wasn't as cream heavy. The wine list was bank...most wines were well over $60-70. Overall, a good meal and I'd probably come back if I was in Montreal--and needing an Italian fix."}
{"text":"Best Italian I have ever had and the service was the best ever. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing evening. The service and food here is above expectations. Had a delicious mixed platter for an appetizer with business colleagues. It had calamari, prosciutto, buratta, and a small lamb chop per person.  My main was a linguine pescatore which is a signature dish at this restaurant.  A little pricey but well worth and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Service is amazing! Food was all really good. With the help of a few champagne bottles, it was a memorable night out for us. The staff was accommodating, the chef even came out in the end to chat and made us a special dessert. We loved the atmosphere, it was classy and romantic. Make sure to come with a big wallet though ;)   Located in the heart of downtown Montreal, it was walking distance from our hotel Le Crystal which was perfect!"}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Montreal, all the food was awesome, really surprised me. Definitely go back again with my mom"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPOINTED! I looked up the menu online. I called a few days ahead to make sure that it's the regular menu for Formula One weekend, they said yes but a couple of dollars more per plate. It wasn't! It was half of the regular menu, most of what we don't eat (we're a group of 6!) and only the most expensive plates! Very, very disappointing!the food was ok, absolutely NOT worth the price, really! And there was no ambiance, no music, no life for a Grand Prix weekend"}
{"text":"Ordered the gnocchi and it was the perfect portion. If you have a car, make sure to find parking on your own as the valet service kinda seemed like a rip-off. There was a bread and sausage plate served to us which tasted fresh. It is a bit on the pricey side however I feel that the service, ambiance, and good quality makes up for it. Definitely a must try if you're in the mood for Italian in Montreal!"}
{"text":"We walked in without reservations and were seated very promptly. The waitstaff was exemplary, the atmosphere was dead on for romance. Service was timed perfectly, our mixed drinks were substantial and done very well. When our dinner arrived it was perfect and we had a personal visit from the owner who was very attentive to our opinions. We will definitely be coming back time and time again!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 11 people for the Grand Prix and we had a wonderful time.  It was an excellent choice for a large group with prefix; they really catered to our needs.  Although it's an Italian spot, their 24 oz steak was insane. I don't think there were any scraps at the end of the night and I got big high fives from my buddies on an excellent choice.  Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"Heard about Da Vinci's many, many times and finally got one of my girlfriends to go with me. We had pretty good expectations going in, and were ready for a fancy night with delicious food.  The service was great, and the room was romantic and fancy. The food was delicious, as expected. We got carried away on wine, but it was worth it! All in all, it was a great experience but if you're looking for a fun night out with your 20 year old friends- this is not the place to be. The scene is very high class, and it's definetllly filled with an older crowd."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE. The best Lychee Martini in town  food was delicious! A1 service! Will be coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"White table cloth traditional service.  Quiet sophisticated atmosphere appropriate for meeting the parents of your sons girlfriend.  Beautiful decor feels like old home.   Food is of high quality sufficient but not over sized portions.   Had a large multi course meal and did not feel stuffed.  Veal shank on risotto was excellent.  Mushroom tagaltelli with pancetta was memorable."}
{"text":"Amazing meal, atmosphere, and service. Veal chop is amazing. Fabulous wine selection. Wish we had time for dessert!"}
{"text":"Mon avis n'est pas à propos du resto, mais plutôt à propos du lougne au sous-sol qui n'est utilisé que pour des événements privés. C'est un espace qui donne l'impression de pouvoir accommoder 60 personnes confortablement et jusqu'à 80 personnes un peu tassé, idéal pour une soirée cocktail et même pour danser un peu. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de places assises, mais je ne crois pas que c'est le genre de lounge pour passer une soirée en tête à tête. À partir de cette salle, on y voit aussi le cellier et plusieurs de nos amis ont passé de bonnes longues minutes à baver en regardant certains des bouteilles qui s'y trouvaient. Le DJ de la soirée était super bon et l'ambiance R&B et électro était parfaite pour la fête de mon amie.  Le prix des drinks était pas mal élevé, 12$ pour un gin tonic avec de Beefeater, c'est un peu trop je trouve. Mais vu que c'était une soirée privée, il faut s'y attendre!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for rather plain food. Way overpriced for what you get. The food is good, but its the same quality you can get elsewhere for a much more reasonable price. And the servers are retarded or had traumatic brain injuries. (TBI)"}
{"text":"My experience at davincis was absolutely spectacular. As soon as we sat down our waiter Lavi was about as pleasant as you could possibly be. He knows the menu in and out and had absolutely flawless food/ wine recommendations. The food was phenomenal yes, but it was the service that really made me want to come back; which I will certainly do in the nearby future. If you want a dinner where not only the service and atmosphere but food is spectacular then I strongly suggest coming to davincis!"}
