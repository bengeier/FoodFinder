{"text":"Very slow and poor service.  Friend almost missed her flight because the food took over 25 minutes. Waitress still wanted to charge for the food that we never did get. Also tried to overcharge for our 2 drinks.  Left next to no tip. Will never return.  Also had a horrid experience at the crowfoot location a couple years back. Very poor service there as well.    Get it together Montana's :/"}
{"text":"Rip off, low value for your money, spent $32.19 for a \"large\" portion of back ribs that did not come as full, an end portion was evidently cut off so the rib would fit on the not very large plate. Rib count was about 9. Asked the manager what is the difference between large and regular and his response was that the regular portion would be half of the large.  In Ontario, we get two large pieces of ribs for this price/order at Montana's."}
{"text":"Montana's at the airport is quick and the food is great. The service has always been prompt, which is important if you need to catch a flight. The first time in, I had a decent plain breakfast served hot and fresh and quick. The second time in, the service was the same and the food just as good. I'm a big fan of their roast chicken dinners and delicious vegetables and mashed potatoes. They never disappoint me....."}
{"text":"First off I have to say the prices seem a LITTLE BIT inflated compared to other Montana's I've been to, but that is to be expected in the airport.  A bottled soda runs you 2.95 at the shops here as opposed to the usual 2.45-2.60.  The layout of the place is typical, log-cabin rustic, sort of rough Americana.  I ordered the Jambalaya and had a slight issue with the meal, Josh the manager was at my table within minutes and handled it amazingly. I have to hand it to him, this is by far the best service I've ever had in YYC.  I will continue to return here due to his actions and the professionalism showed by this establishment.  One of the better places to eat in YYC!!!"}
{"text":"For a quick lunch in a barnyard atmosphere country franchise located In the pre security departure left section of theCalgary International Airport; Montana's won't fail with a menu of ribs, salad, chicken and various flatbreads and entrees that has something for everyone.  The menu is quite ordinary and the plates were Not memorable enough to warrant a Photo.  Ribs, pot roast soup and jambalaya rice bowls were good and 3 star worthy  Service was exceptionally friendly and courteous from the greeting by the hostess to our extremely attentive waitress.  We were seated in a wooden booth overlooking the passage ways of Yyc in a barnyard environment with a Country music soundtrack serving as background noise; very appropriate!  The simple and double sided dessert menu was the star of the show; especially the Nutella Waffle with caramel dipping sauce on the side  which was available in a 1/2 portion for a sensible indulgence, hmm hmm #FoodPorn"}
{"text":"A little slow to get seated but our server more than made up for it. Good food and very attentive service.  The lettuce wraps were a good gluten free option."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill prior to my flight so I decided to go to montana's  It looks like the typical Montana's location.  It wasn't too busy so I got a prime seat where I could see the retail area of the airport.  I ordered the baby back rib and wing combo.  Surprisingly for an airport location it was only priced about $2 to $3 more than our local Montana's location.  I was happy with the food.  One of the wings tasted a little dry, but no complaints.  The kitchen even honoured my request of no butter on my grilled veggies!  Since it was quiet, I had great service from my waitress.  All in all it was a great visit to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Only restaurant outside of the gate at the Calgary airport.   I had the chicken tenders. All batter. No chicken. Sad face.   But what do you want? Airport food...  They do have a food court upstairs. But they have endless pop refills, which can be good or bad depending on your waistline....."}
{"text":"A solid 3 for consistency   Since they dropped the hot beef sandwich I am less inclined but Kapow shrimp are nice, a little spicy but tasty   Service is good esp in the lounge at the bar if you are in a hurry"}
{"text":"It's a Montanans but o find ones outside the airport way frocking better, same as Kelsey's it's always dry and seems old!"}
{"text":"After spending 2+ weeks in Northern Alberta and Calgary, I was more than ready to go home and reconnect with my amazing Wife. One practical upshot is that I arrived at YYC about 3 hours before my flight was to depart. And since you can't go through customs any earlier than 2 hours, there was time to kill. However, with luggage all I wanted to do was sit and perhaps enjoy an adult beverage.   Montana's was the most obvious choice and there was plenty of room for my bags. Service was prompt and friendly, my Rickards Red was cold and satisfying, and the overpriced munchies were OK. I'm glad I stopped as the choices on the other side of customs are more limited."}
{"text":"The Poutine appetizer was good. That's where the  good part ends. The fish and chips were nasty and the steak was over cooked. Unfortunately our experience only got worse when a kitchen hand took a fancy to my daughter and kept pulling down his pants to show her his naked bottom. I reported it to the hostess, who reported it to the waiter who then called a manager who told me he would investigate. He return and told me the man was autistic and just watching TV. I told him we appreciated the man might be autistic but that I had also seen the man's bottom in all its glory so the manager went and hid in the back until we left. He did nothing about the guy who continued to spy on my daughter, we paid the full bill and left. An apology would have been nice;  making sure that we remained unmolested for the remainder of our meal would have been nice but that was obviously beyond the capacity of the existing management. Avoid this restaurant at all costs they don't deserve any business."}
{"text":"I had a salad with grilled salmon. The salmon filet was tiny, the salad lacked ingredients, and the avocado was really hard & yet to ripen. On top of that, the meal took 30 min to arrive yet the restaurant was almost empty.   There are much better and even cheaper places to eat at this airport."}
{"text":"Ok food at typical airport prices. Service was also ok. Truly nothing special but a small step up from airport fast food."}
{"text":"As I walked into this airport restaurant trailing my suitcase, the hostess (who also turned out to be my waitress) asked how long until my flight, and responded to my answer by assuring me \"plenty of time,\" but in fact I actually missed my flight by about ten minutes due to eating here plus the long holiday lines at US Customs, so I'm not too happy about this dining experience.  Waitress suited action to words by being comfortably leisurely about the speed of service, nothing that would have been out of place in a restaurant that wasn't in an airport, but this one is.  I came here because I was hoping to have one more Alberta steak before leaving the province, but this was the least good one I had.  It was rather dry and slightly overcooked, and the toppings, which were a huge hunk of fried onion rings and jalapenos dumped on top, were ridiculous and hard to eat with the steak.  The waitress warned me it was a huge meal, and when I queried this, because the menu said the steak was only 6 oz., she said it was because of the two sides.  Well, no, they were ordinary-sized side dishes, and actually pretty good.  The corn was OK and tastier than the corn I had in much better places.  Nevertheless, this meal wasn't worth the price I paid for it, which turned out to be sitting around for five hours in the gate area waiting for the next flight after the one I missed.  I only give it two stars because the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for one last steak before I departed Alberta.  I ordered an 8 ounce top sirloin medium rare.   Considering this is an airport location, I was quite shocked by how long I had to wait for my food (25 mins?) It was probably a good thing that my flight was delayed.   The steak arrived perfectly cooked and quite tasty. Served with battered onions, some fries, baked beans and cornbread. The cornbread was awfully sweet, tasted like cake, so I didn't eat eat. Everything else was good."}
{"text":"There aren't many options in this airport but I'd recommend settling for fast food or vending machine snacks over the horrible tasting food this place serves.  The server wasn't concerned with time or refills, the food took over 35 minutes to prepare but tasted like it was expired and needed to be buried with toxic waste.  Nachos were $21.00 and the customer who ordered them was complaining, so I ordered a seafood dish. This place shouldn't be allowed to smear the state's name!"}
{"text":"Had the 10 oz steak. It was a karma dinner -- I suffered almost as much as the cow that died to provide it. The fine Alberta beef was way over cooked -- sliced first and THEN grilled -- and liverish with no char flavour at all. The baked potato was clearly a reheat and so leathery on the outside that my steak knife could barely cut it. And the seasonal vegetables were just steamed frozen broccoli and cauliflower florets. A disappointing way to exit Calgary."}
{"text":"Hit and Miss!!   I honestly debated between 2 and 3 stars.....  Service was pretty quick and painless. Server was friendly and attentive enough. However it would have been nice if they gave me a menu to start with for drinks though (I was on the restaurant side of Montana). I had to ask for the menu. Apparently, they're changing the drink menu price..... So I guess they're in the midst of printing new drink menus?  My fruit market lemonade with blueberries, strawberries and grapes was relatively refreshing  .... Despite not having blackberries.....which was specifically mentioned in the menu. It was still good though. I'd probably half sweet it next time though. I probably would have been okay with the exchange of blackberries with grapes IF the price of my nonalcoholic drink didn't go from $3.50 to $5.50. Don't think I'll order this ever again.  I also ordered an apple pecan harvest salad.... Which was probably the saving grace for the Montana's in YYC. 4 stars for the salad itself! The salad was fresh. Apple was crisp. I liked the sweet crunchy pecans. The red pepper also gave the salad a nice fresh crunch to it. And I liked the cheese and cranberries. I honestly enjoyed every component of it.  However.... I wouldn't order the side of baked potatoes again though..... The menu structure given to me was misleading. I thought I just had to add $1.15 to get the baked potato.... But apparently it doesn't apply to the salad..... The menu layout suggested otherwise. Anyways .... It doesn't seem to be seasoned with any salt/butter. And it lacked cheese and bacon bits. It sort of reminds me of a sad leftover baked potato."}
