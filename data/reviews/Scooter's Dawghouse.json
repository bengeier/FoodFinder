{"text":"I'm so happy winter hours were started, but these hot dogs are entirely worth the long waits in the summertime too. And Scott's amazing customer service always makes up for it!  My favorites are the Chicago and Hawaiian dogs with chili cheese fries. Scooter's is also very generous with the amount of fries they give you, so there's usually plenty for sharing, even with a small order!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.   Great hotdogs & the marshmallow milk shake is a must."}
{"text":"This place has very good service and their milkshakes are the bomb! If you are looking for a place to go with your family, then choose Scooter's."}
{"text":"Scooter and his dawghouse are legendary in this area. Scooter is extremely friendly and remembers our order every time we come, and even knows our family members names and their orders when they visit from out of town. The food is excellent and even the junior fry is enough for an entire family. They have a huge variety of hot dog types and sizes and I love their quarter pound dawg. My wife always orders the Hawaiian dawg and raves about it. Prices are very reasonable for what you get as well. The restaurant has such a fun atmosphere inside and we know we can always come here for good food and a great time."}
{"text":"Love this place, have been coming here for 8 years but since the new owners took over, somehow the service has changed. Waited 30 minutes for our order last week. We were told they only had 4 fryers going. Will think twice about going in next time if we have to wait that long. I get that it's a fast food place, etc but they need to plan their staff accordingly."}
{"text":"Best dogs around and a damn good burger too. Warning when order the fries a small one will feed at least 3 people. Get them while you can because they are closed from Holloween till St. Pats"}
{"text":"Scooter's has the best hotdogs, not to mention a TOWER of french fries.  Our summer wouldn't be complete if we didn't stop there at least once a month!  You have to try it for yourself.  They have other great stuff too, but we seem to always go for the DAWGS!"}
{"text":"Scooters is the best! Amazing hot dogs, fries, milk shakes, and ice cream. Personal favorites are the hawaiian dog and cookies & cream. The owner is super friendly and welcoming. Great service."}
{"text":"I've been to Scooters about 3 times. They have a fair selection of dogs, burgers, etc. on the menu. The dogs are excellent! If you are hungry, go for the french fries, they give you HUGE portions of fries! I think the place is owned by an elderly gentleman, and his restaurant hours may be seasonal. At any case, the food is reasonable, good, with good portions served. My kind of place!!"}
{"text":"A really cool, fun place! Awesome variety of dogs! Great place for families to go before hitting Headlands Beach! Prices are very fair! Plenty of options and great ice cream!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 different kind of hot dogs and they were all fantastic. The hot dog was perfectly cooked and the bun was the right size. The toppings were placed very well to be able to pick it up and eat without it all falling off. Very delicious and busy with all the locals. Will definitely be back again when I am in town."}
{"text":"First time visiting and was floored at the welcome i received when i walked in. Tried the nacho dawg with coney fries. Dog was perfectly portioned with a great ratio of toppings to hot dog. Fries are fresh cut and were amazing. I would definately reccommend to friends."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great hot dogs and tons of great hand cut fries. Not expensive either awesome ice cream after a day at the beach. Must stop."}
{"text":"I'm really glad that I live within a mile of Scooter's.  The staff is friendly and the food is great!  The menu consists of all different types of hot dogs (phenomenal here) as well as some other options.  The portion of fries received is ridiculous - a \"small\" will feed a small family!  Their ice cream is also great and the prices of all of this are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My friends and I were wrapping up a day at the beach when one of them suggested Hot Dogs and Ice Cream.  On a beautiful summer day... we all thought it was a great idea!  He knew about this place and we all stopped by.  My first impression from the outside was that it looked like an ice cream parlor.  Families and couples in line to order from a window... people sitting on picnic benches eating ice cream... kids running around... the works  My second impression was that the ordering line did not make sense.  From the door, the line went into the middle of the crowded room, turned 270 degrees, followed a counter, then turned 90 degrees to the register, and then the waiting area was at the other corner of the room.  None of this is marked at all... and it seemed unnecessarily complicated for no reason.  The room is divided up by these bar height counters?  I did not understand why because you couldn't really eat at them, they were just in the way.  Anyway, one of the humorous moments from the day was when my friend was denied the \"family\" size fries... which he had assumed was the best size for our group of five.  He was corrected to a \"medium\" fries... which turned out to be more than enough for the group :-P  The hot dogs were great and VERY big... #Murica all the way!  My three star rating was simply due to the ordering process being frustratingly inefficient and unclear for no-reason.  Even when the line shortened up and one of my friends went back in for a ice-cream Sunday, he gave up because it was taking too long."}
{"text":"Best customer service ever! The owner is always there to greet you and make sure that you have a great experience! The food is incredible and the atmosphere is even better! My family LOVES this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Scooter's several times.  The hot dogs are great!  The fry portions are enormous.  The space is quite small inside, but the food is worth putting up with the crowd.  My in-laws got burgers last time we were there and said they were bad, but you should be getting hot dogs anyway so don't worry about it."}
{"text":"WOW.  This place has great food.  We had a couple of dawgs that were THE BEST.  My wife had a bleu burger and she said it was the best burger she has ever had.  A small order of fries is enough to feed \"four\" people.  This was my first time eating at Scooter's Dawghouse, and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Such a cool place! We really enjoyed our fpod and the family-friendly atmosphere. My family and I are from Alabama and have never been to a place like this. I can't wait to go back up to Cleveland and eat here again!"}
{"text":"Hot dog heaven. They have literally any kind of hot dog you could want. I got a coney with onions and mustard and bro got a Chicago dog without jalape√±os ( he can't handle the heat lol). We shared fried pickles and peppers. They use Tony Packos original pickles and peppers, so they do have a bit of a kick. They were AMAZING. There wasn't much of a wait when we first got there, but about five minutes later the line was out the door. They move through it pretty quickly though. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I am indeed a fan and would have actually gave it 5 stars if I liked the \"chili sauce\" or whatever was on the dog (sweet, syrupy kinda like french dressing). Otherwise this place is just a fun place to go if you are in the mood for some basic American comfort food and light-heartedness in the form of food. The kids loved it."}
{"text":"Some people have a place, sometimes a restaurant, that just epitomizes a certain time and place for them. It may be some McDonalds you used to hang out at, or the restaurant where you proposed to someone, whatever.  For me, Scooter's is one of those restaurants. Crazy huge selection of dawgs and other foodstuffs, footlongs that are closer to meterlongs, excellent hard ice cream (with a new flavor just about every month), and easily some of the best, and most fries I've ever eaten. Going there with four people? get a single.  Even with the occasional long-ish wait (no worse than a semi-busy Five Guys) theres a nice mural all along the little shack (literal shack) showing a cute little boardwalk, and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF DAWG. Service is always excellent, and even when you're going there with 3 other friends on an empty stomach (aka 3 dawgs a piece) its pretty much impossible for them to get your order wrong. There may be a couple good hot dog restaurants IN Cleveland, but the best one is just a half hour out of your way, and worth it ten times over."}
{"text":"When we're in the area we love stopping at Scooter's.  The french fries are a must, but a small is HUGE(enough for 3 solid eaters) so order appropriately.  We're not big hotdog people but there's plenty of other stuff on the menu.  It's all cooked to order so expect a little wait and if it's nice weather and a weekend expect a line out the door but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! So many choices, my favorite is the home wrecker Chicago. It is so good I have to force myself to try one of the many others. Also a great place to learn hot dog etiquette. Ali's a new definition of the word \"small\" when it comes to French fries."}
{"text":"The fries are the best and come in huge portions. The Chicago dog is my favorite and so good that I can't make myself try other items on the menu. It is a fun place to stop on the way home from the beach or to bring out-of-town guests for something that is not \"just another chain restaurant\"."}
{"text":"We had to come by this place twice.  The first time the lunch line was way too long but the second time was just right.  I'm glad we came back.  Portion of fries were ridiculously large.  My burger was great and my co-workers hot dog looked tasty.  This place has the coolest mural I've ever seen in a restaurant.  The mural pretty much captures what America used to be like in it's glory days.  You have to see this place to believe it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The triple meat burger is literally the best burger I've ever had. I had misread the description and didn't realize it had corned beef, of which I am in no way a fan. I think it's salty and the flavor overpowers everything on the plate.   Ooohhh boy, that's not the case for the Triple Meat Burger. There's also a horseradish sauce that's not overly horseradish-y.   I'm annoyed that it took me so long to try something other the a hotdog.   Perfect meal: -Triple Meat Burger -Coney cheese fries  -Frozen lemonade"}
{"text":"We love this place! Scott & his crew are the best! Be warned this place is only open from March to Labor Day so go as much as you can in those short 6 months!   We went today for \"opening day\" and while we waited about 40 minutes outside in line it was WORTH IT...even in 35 degree temps.  Yes you read that right - totally worth it!   We get the shorts so we can try more flavors but bunches of people around us we're getting home wreckers. Today was a Nacho short, XXtreme short, cheddar bacon short & a scooter short...we also ordered two strawberry chocolate shakes and a small fry...all for $19 and some change!   Everything by these folks is delish - like the jalape√±o  popper dawg, Cardinal dawg, corn dog nuggets with ranch, the triple meat burger (yes burger at a dawg house), or the pumpkin ice cream...please just order, enjoy the scents while waiting & then SMASH some killer crispy all meat dawgs while sitting in their dining area or outside on a picnic table!  Remember we only have a few blissful months a year of this...well and of sunshine..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Very kitchy feel and good, cheap food. Definitely not the best food ever, there are better actual hot dogs like Koegel's out there after all. The actual combinations are seemingly endless and interesting. When I went, I stuck with more traditional options (The Lucky Dawg - ketchup, mustard, relish and onions) and tried the Kraut Dawg (kraut and brown mustard). I gotta say, whatever kraut it is that they use is pretty awesome.  My friend and I split a Jr fry which was more than enough for us. She got a long kraut dawg which was enormous! We each also got a chocolate malt and it was delicious.  This place is definitely worth checking out. The staff seemed pretty nice - the owner taking orders was super friendly. Also, the amount of food you get for your money is a really good value."}
{"text":"Yum!! I mean, it's hot dogs and fries and stuff,  so nothing fancy. I ran over here after the morning at headlands beach. I got the Hawaiian dog (no mayo because I hate it) and fried pickles and peppers. So good!! Everything is fast and delicious. The fries are huge so plan accordingly - a small will feed me and husband with leftovers. On the weekends, expect a line, but weekdays is pretty quick!"}
{"text":"A huge mound of fries -  Bacon, nacho cheese, footlongs -  More food than you can eat -   Scooter is a wheelchair bound vet that serves up the best weiners, fries, burgers and get a shake because there is nothing better!"}
{"text":"Great service and an excellent selection of summer delights! From about 20 unique hot dog combinations (think Chicago dog, Hawaiian dog) to burgers and fries and then on to ice cream they have all you could want for a tasty summer meal. I had a craving for a non fast food burger and after searching my handy Yelp app, was directed to Scooters. I opted for the basic cheeseburger with all the accoutrements and fresh cut fries and it hit the spot like no other. I wanted to try one of their hot dogs but I wasn't feeling all that glutinous that day. The only thing I wish I would have done differently is order dessert! Talk about legitimate ice cream heaven, hard scoop, soft serve, Flurries, shakes, malts, sundaes and all the topping in between!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place.   My favorite is the jumping jack flash burger.   The fries are fantastic and huge.  I wish it was open all year round."}
{"text":"Well... they are closed for the season but they will open back up (I think) on St. Patrick's Day.  Be sure to make a point to visit!  They have lots of different kinds of hot dogs, hamburgers and french fries.  Everything we've tried is delicious!  And the fries!  Oh the fries!  Huge portions!  And by huge --- I mean huge!  The restaurant itself is pretty small but there are plenty of picnic tables outside to sit and enjoy your food.  There is also lots of ice cream choices on the menu but I've never tried them because I'm always too stuffed with french fries!"}
{"text":"This is one my most favorite places to eat in Mentor.  They have a huge selection of different burgers and hot dogs you can get, with all different kinds of toppings.  If you order fries, watch out!  They give you soooo much!  The smallest size is too much for two people!  Also, their ice cream is amazing after a long day or before a long day at the beach.  It is definitely affordable.  I have been there many times and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great hot dog and fries!!!"}
{"text":"Fun, good, reasonable prices. Joe at the counter was so friendly and helpful. The burger was one of the best I've ever had. Can't wait to stop by again"}
{"text":"For years I've heard about Scooters but never made it there. My family couldn't believe I had never been. So this trip home, I made it a point to visit the famous Scooter's Dawghouse.   The fries are the biggest fries I've ever seen. The best value ever. Literally piling over the paper basket. We originally ordered a small, but the nice girl at the counter educated us on exactly how big they are. So after that, we ordered a Junior size which was more than enough for my boyfriend and I. We love french fries, it's our weakness. You know when you order fries from a normal establishment, and it never seems to be enough? Well, don't worry, that is not the case here.  A wonderful local establishment with a hometown feel. A huge menu that is kind of overwhelming. The kind of place you see on Triple D's or some special on Food Network.  Next time I visit, I will try the ice cream."}
{"text":"Super cute summer-y post-beach hang out spot in Mentor. I haven't had a hot dog but the ice cream is great with plenty of places inside, outside, and under the trees to chill. But typically be prepared for a huge line which has always been out the door. Also the fries are insane you'll get more than you bargained for and it's practically a food challenge to finish."}
{"text":"Good Burgers and great hot dogs. I haven't tried any of their desert stuff but it looks good. I like to order ahead because they can sometimes get a huge crowd when sport teams show up after games. Do not underestimate the size of their fries."}
{"text":"I'm standing in this establishment now waiting over 30 minutes for my order. This place is run extremely inefficiently for the amount of traffic coming through. I've heard the good here is wonderful, but for this amount of wait time nothing is that good at a fast food dive."}
{"text":"Some people complain about the line but they don't realize their is a line for a reason. This place is a lake county must go you will never leave feeling hungry the home wrecker with coney sauce and a Junior fry is plenty. This place always gives you more then you pay for. The place is family owned and clean I just can't say enough good about this place"}
{"text":"Go go go to Scooter's for tasty hotdogs and fries. Take the kids on the way to the beach or for a footlong chili dog. Don't forget the ice cream too. Only opened seasonally but worth the winter wait."}
{"text":"Scooters is a great place to go in the summer to get a great hotdog an awesome french fries. It's a great family owned and operated business and I go there with my family as often as we can."}
{"text":"Anybody who doesn't like this place is not to be trusted. What could be better than a tasty dog and ice cream all in the same establishment. Turn loose your inner child and eat there. Al fresco dining at the picnic tables ( weather permitting ), doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"AMAZING, always just got hot dogs, fries & ice cream but oh my gosh their burger was the best burger i ever had. there isn't anything on the menu that's not good. EVERYTHING IS GOOD"}
{"text":"The ultimate post-beach snack! A must if you have spent the day soaking up the sun at mentor headlands. Serving sizes are huge and great price. I've supported this local business for 10+ years. Wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"Scooters is by far the best place to take your family for ice cream, hot dogs, and of course the monstrous order of French fries they can feed the worlds biggest family with one order. The staff is amazing and always very friendly.  They add a little special touch to the junior kids cones with the candy faces( my daughter loves that they do that and always asks other ice cream places to do it but they seem to be the only one that still does this ) we continue to go back as this is one of our favorite places.   I didn't mention the most famous part of scooters is there variety of hot dogs that make them so popular. I don't like hot dogs but the list is incredible for hot dog loves. They do have sandwiches and chicken and much more too."}
{"text":"Scooters to us is tasty food plain and simple. With that being said Scooters has some things they could work on. First thing is the price of their food. For what it is it's over priced. Second EVERY time we go it's always a huge wait for food even with a called in order(Not much they can do with how small the place is) We usually get foot long hot dogs I enjoy the extreme dog and the Hawaiian dog is strongly tasty who would think pineapple and mayo with mozzarella cheese would go together? We grabbed some food from the this past sunday 6/26. We called in our order it was a foot long Chicago dog and I got a large coney fry with extra coney sauce. Omg the best this there is their coney chili and I'm not a fan of chili TBH. So we got the hot dog the fry and a large choc. milk shake it was like 16 $ Maybe that's not a lot to most but we don't make a whole lot so when you go out and things are pricey sometimes you can get a little upset. Any ways a lot of people must not mind the prices place is always packed. I decided on a 3 star for the long wait whether it's called in or you are waiting in a line out side for 30 min waiting to place your order then wait another 20 just for some hot dogs. There is nice amount of parking around the building and I do like the picnic tables  with umbrellas out side. Big menu with some crazy and fun toppings. I really Enjoy scott  and am not trying to bash this place as I said before we do like this place but we tend to only go a few times each summer."}
{"text":"Even under new management, the little restaurant has proven that being in the dawg house is not a bad thing. My only negative is that they are too popular, all summer there will be a like out the door but believe me, the second you see a 20lb sack of potatoes piled onto a tray you'll realize it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"The selection of hotdogs are esqusite. They have amazing toppings I never would have thought of.  The fries bring back memories of the fair but are big. The only downfall is not enough seating and slow service. But otherwise it is a summer staple"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and the fries are amazing! I guarantee you won't leave hungry. Can wait to go back."}
{"text":"Super good! They should be open more then just summer. The place is super small and crammed. It's always super busy"}
{"text":"My grandma would always take me here as a kid such great memories full of love and icecream"}
{"text":"This place is a Mentor classic! Yes, it's hotdogs and milkshakes, but it is so much fun.  It makes you feel like a kid again.  There are some fairly healthy options so grownups don't have too feel too badly about regular visits.  Plus everyone is super friendly. Check out their Facebook page to see what I mean.  Definitely a fun place to take the whole family."}
{"text":"The place meets the hype!  It's been over ten years since moving away from Mentor, but I try to make it back here a few times a year. When I lived here, I'd come here for lunch or dinner three or four times a month during their open season.  The food is always delicious! It is definitely worth the wait to stand in line to place your order and wait for it to cook.  They've got three different sizes of hot dogs that you can get made up in a variety of ways. The french fries are always fresh cut and generous in their portions.  Milk shakes, sundaes, and other ice cream treats along with some other appetizers and snacks round out the menu. I highly recommend the fresh squeezed lemonade."}
{"text":"Love the variety of items! It's fun trying different hot dogs! Also, the fry sizes are huge! A Jr fry is enough for two to three people!!!"}
{"text":"Great dogs decent ice cream and shakes! Get a nacho dog, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Some good - some bad. Service varies. When they're busy during the summer (students are working), I feel like it's a more unfriendly environment. It's also really cramped. Last time I went, there was an older gentleman taking the orders and he provided some good, old-fashioned customer service (that the place had been lacking). Food: hot dogs are gross to me. For being a \"hot dog place,\" that's not a good thing. It's probably just personal preference, but I prefer a normal-sized hot dog (oh, come on, grow up). For real, though - don't care for the jumbo dog. The bun was not toasted at all, so it just got soggy and fell apart. How hard can it be to make a solid hotdog? Milk shakes are good and the ice cream I've seen people order just looks amazing! Again, for being a hot dog and burger place, you'd think the burgers would be good. Nope. Frozen burgers - if it wasn't seasoned so well (I ordered the spicy burger...forget name), I'd have stopped after one bite. It honestly made me gag a little and I did not finish it. Lastly, tots are pretty great and they give you huge portions, as I'm sure you've read in every one else's review. This is one of the few restaurants close to Mentor Headlands - it's too bad it isn't a little better. Always busy though. Someone likes it, I guess."}
{"text":"Always got to stop by here when hitting the beach. Great place to take your kids. It's one of those things that they will remember when they grow up. Beach, ice cream, specialty hot dogs and lots of fries!"}
{"text":"Love the Dog House - seating is tight but food is excellent - fries are super large helpings for a family!!!"}
{"text":"Love Scooter's!  Great summer treat and the people are always wonderful!"}
{"text":"I like going to Scooter's. It's a summertime fun spot. Everything is made to order and there's typically a lot of people ordering, making your wait even longer, so don't expect your food to come out fast. If you're one of those impatient people whose time is more valuable than others, visit when the lines are shorter. It's a laid back kind of place. Sorry, but don't come if you don't have time.   This is a counter order stand. On busy hot days, there will be two places to order, an outside window for ice cream only and the inside counter for food and ice cream. This helps speed things up for those wanting only ice cream. Inside you will find a couple tables and a wall of seats to relax while waiting for food. There are several picnic tables around the small parking lot to eat or you can do take out. These are the only options. It's not a restaurant.   The ordering line moves pretty quick and the staff are usually pretty friendly and happy to help you. They have some great things going on and some things that could be better.   The ice cream is always good and priced very reasonably. There's a huge selection of flavors. The burgers are ok. The toppings are fresh. The buns have too much bread. I don't like the dense kaiser roll they use and would prefer a soft bun. It over powers the single patty burgers. The meat is average quality, not bad, but could use some seasonings and is sometimes over cooked. My son says the hot dogs are always good. I'll have to try one at some point. The combinations of toppings are broad, lots of options. The fries come in very generous portions. I am a huge fan of fries and I wish these were better because they easily could be! They kinda ruin a good thing here. They fresh cut their own potatoes. For the size cut they use, they way over cook the potato. This makes me want to cry. It doesn't even taste like a fry as much as a chip. Then, they don't put any seasoning on them out of the fryer. By the time I get them, the salt doesn't stick as the potatoes are overly crispy. It's hard to believe they mess up something so simple and with all those boxes of fresh potatoes in the side hall, they're sitting on a gold mine if they could learn to make a good fry!  Today we ordered a burger, a double burger, a footlong dog, small fries (huge portion) and two large shakes for $25. Anyhow, definitely it's worth a summer visit if you're close by."}
{"text":"So far THE BEST dogs we've found in Ohio!    You may have to wait to get your order in but the wait is worth it.  The dogs are tasty, the shakes are wonderful and the fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Had to come here before I went back to Vegas and before they close for the end of summer.  We had a slaw dawg and grilled cheese sandwich with 2 milkshakes.  One peanut butter and one marshmallow!  The line was so long but super speedy and quick!  If ur in Cleveland take a short drive outta the city and swing by and check out this mom and pop shop! PLZ GET THE FRIES!  I suggest you drive ur food down the street to the lake to the fairport beach!"}
{"text":"Always a delicious treat on a hot day! About 5 minutes away from Mentor Headlands Beach. Scooter's has tons of different topped \"dawgs\" along with burgers, humongous piles of French fries, onion rings, shakes, ice cream, & more! Today I decided to order the \"Coney Dawg\" - hotdog with Coney sauce (tastes like manwich sauce) , \"Jack Dawg\" - hotdog with ketchup, mustard, and relish & a small fry. When you order you get the option for a regular size dog (short dawg), a footlong dog (long dawg), and an extra long dog (homeworker). The hotdogs come piled with the toppings your choice has. Beware that a small fry is enough to feed two hungry adults! They are so delicious they taste like fair fries. Also try their classic shakes perfect for right after a walk on the beach. Just like most of their portions a large is more like an extra large. Highly recommend this treasure of a place right off of Lake Erie you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A great Summer time place to eat. Their fries are crazy good!"}
{"text":"A spring-time favorite for many years. Friendly staff, patrons and menu options. Don't pass it by!"}
{"text":"It's good old America at its best. Stop here for epic proportions of fries pairing with very good hotdogs, burgers and the usual players. Nearby Headland State Park nearby is one of the coolest places to chill near the lake in Summer months and Scooter's right over there."}
{"text":"I went to college in Painesville and have to admit this place was at the top of my list for grub spots. The ice cream is delicious. Love the dawgs and fries. The orders of fries are plentiful. Literally I dream of this place! The lemonade is also really good! Parking can be a drag...."}
{"text":"Pretty cute little place!  They fry their hot dogs..I dig that..  Wish they had some healthier choices for kids.  I hate feeding my little girl unhealthy food.  Its good as a summer treat though!  The place can get super packed in the summer..parking can be hairy sometimes..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. It's a great little place. The hotdogs are very good and the selection is outstanding. Be prepared to wait a little for your food because of the line of people."}
{"text":"The menu is outstanding! Take a chance on this local fave! Milkshakes,  Ice cream, and fries galore!"}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter Grouchy?  Scooter is incredible and remembers to the letter what everyone orders.  Come in once and you are friends for life!  The food is awesome especially the Hawaiian Hog Dog.  Yum.  Having serious withdraw here in December.  Scooters rocks."}
{"text":"You want fries? You got fries! You want a hotdog as thick and long as your arm? You got it, bubba! You want a shake? Good Luck, I've never made it past the first 2 items altough they look fantastic.   The crew is awesome and it is well worth the wait. Can't say enough good things about this place. You'll see me and the Miata club back there again this summer."}
{"text":"After seeing all the great reviews I couldn't wait to try this place out. It was a little out of my way, but I figured the results would be well worth it.       Well, this review will probably put me in the doghouse with the regulars. I just wasn't impressed. The storefront looks okay, the parking lot is busy, and entering the dining area reveals a compact space, but that's okay as I soon realize that the do a ton of 'to go' traffic. The service is friendly, the staff seems really nice and accomodating.      It's the food where the issue starts and ends. The dogs just don't blow me away. They have a nice selection of toppings, a nice mix of flavors to appeal to nearly any palate that walks into the place. I just found the dogs themselves to be a whole lot of 'meh'.      Same with the burger I tried, the 'triple meat'. The burger was a touch overcooked and just didn't pop. I don't know if I was just expecting more because of the excellent reviews or what. I would eat here again, but I wiuldn't drive 20 minutes out of my way."}
{"text":"First time I went to Scooters & had the *Home Wrecker* with coney sauce and boy I tell you it was one of the best hot dog I've ever ate, the fries are awesome huge portions, the coney sauce was great, keep up the great job... Had to go back & get my fill at Scooters [6*22*17] never disappointed on their food, enough fries to feed an Army..."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO GO! Everything and anything you get here is delicious and amazing!!!!! Guarantee once you go you will be back. And when they close for the winter..you'll cry!"}
{"text":"one word to describe scooters: magical. for years i've heard people rant and rave about this place but never really made the effort to go until last week and i am very regretful that it took me so long!  a girlfriend of mine and her 2 year old came up here last wednesday for lunch around 12. this was absolutely not the best time but her schedule didn't allow for flexibility so we made the most out of an extremely crowded situation. the line was already out the door so i told my friend to take her daughter to one of the picnic tables outside while i waited in line to give the order. the staff here handles crowds very well and i have to say some of the patrons here were indescribably rude. the group of people behind me couldn't have been screaming louder about nothing. the biggest loudmouth of all was a 35 year old woman absolutely shrieking about every and anything her coworkers would listen to her about. this woman made me want to rip my ears off. luckily the line moved relatively fast. i had a jack dog (ketchup, mustard, relish) and a chili dog. my friend wanted a naked dog, which has nothing on it. i find this to be quite sacrilegious but whatever floats your boat. they have a small menu for kids too which is great, and the girl taking my order told me the kids fry could easily feed 3 people so we instead of getting one for ourselves, we decided to do that. 3 hot dogs, a kids meal and 3 drinks was around 17 bucks. can't beat that.   after you order you wait in the back area for an employee to call your name and give you your food.  my name was called and i brought my tray over to their toppings station which has chopped onions, relish, ketchup and mustard as well as other goodies if you'd prefer to dress your dog yourself. the 35 year old ignoramus i had mentioned earlier comes back into the kitchen now. as i'm trying to fill some ketchup containers for my tray, she is leaving over me, over and over, trying to get ketchup. she hasn't even gotten her food yet considering she was behind me. never once apologizing and just downright acting like a hillbilly. if this place wasn't packed with children and families i think i would've ripped her a new ass hole. it's a shame people like her ruin places like this for the rest of us because she can't sit down and shut up like an adult for 30 minutes in public.   at the end of the day, though, these hot dogs are insanely delicious! the chili dog was interesting as the chili had corn in it which i was weary of. it ended up being fantastic. i personally find them much better and much more creative than happy dog. and the aforementioned employee was not lying about the size of the children's fry! we could barely even make a dent in it! i can't wait to take more of my friends here, and next time at an off hour. definitely a summer staple!"}
{"text":"If you love wieners this is the place to go! Their hot dogs are fantastic with tons of toppings to chose from. Burgers are good too but I usually stick with the hot dogs. The fries are to die for but warning don't get a large unless you plan on feeding a family of 15. Still haven't tried the ice cream cause I never have the room for it but I'm sure it's just as delicious as everything else. The Dawghouse is cute and retro inside and reminds me of something I'd see on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Perfect spot to stop at before or after going to the beach. Only open during the summer months but gives you a reason to look forward to March."}
{"text":"I should have gotten a hot dog given the name but opted for a burger and O-rings followed by a sundae( calorie splurge!).   The burger didn't SAY it was handmade,  wishful thinking on my part. They were the usual pre-formed patties that have pretty much made me not order a burger for the past 5 years.  ( Will people  never understand you NEED those grilled little almost burnt nubbins on the edge of a hand formed burger for it to qualify as a great burger?????? I don't care how many toppings they offer, if the meat isn't freshly hand formed and great, neither is the burger.). Not inedible, but I am still looking for a great burger. O-rings were OK as well, better than the burger.  Sundae OK, just not the \"best I had\" even locally.( Malley's fudge is better, East Coast's ice cream is better) Husband had the same as me and felt the same as me although he is less picky about burgers in general.   Thinking this is one of those places you like to go to because it's locally owned and you are nearby or maybe part of the \"day at the beach\" routine  more than due to the food, which is fine, it's \"OK \"just not \"fantastic\" as some reviews seem to feel.     I will probably go back sometime and try the dog just to make sure I'm not missing something ;)."}
{"text":"Sooo I had this amazing hotdog yesterday, quite possibly the best one I've ever had. I had the short super dog, cheese sauce, chili, and sauerkraut. Yum! Cheese sauce was on point, I'm often unsure of chili but it was delicious and sauerkraut with these toppings? I was cautious, but j was pleasantly surprised. The toppings were piled on and of course they were falling off as I was shoving this hotdog in my face, good thing we got it to go! Also the bun was one of the softest buns I've had. Now the fries, yes it's true a small will feed a small army but my husband and I love fries. They were crispy but i was hoping for something a little more, maybe with salt or a seasoning as soon as they came out of the frier? Also some were too crispy for me (I'll admit I love mooshy fries, I'm strange I know.) but still they were good.   Scooters is fabulous and we can't wait to go back! Everyone was spot on about what I've been hearing for the past 3-4 months. (Newer to the area and were trying to eat like the locals.) Also I should have listened when I was told to avoid Them during opening week, but the line out the door was worth it for that super dawg!"}
{"text":"Ate the home wrecker hotdog with chili, mustard, and onions. It is definitely the biggest hot dog I have ever seen, but it doesn't come close to being the best one I've ever eaten. The accompanying junior fries, while double the size of an extra large at McDonald's, are also not very good. The staff, however, is very friendly, in addition to be fast and courteous. To summarize, if you want to see a giant hot dog or what a whole bag of french fries looks like on your tray, stop in. If you are looking for a friendly place, you could give this place a shot. However, if you are looking for good food, keep on driving."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best dogs I've ever had.  Our entire family anxiously awaits their spring opening every year. Too bad they close during the winter.  You really need to try this summer favorite.  The fresh cut frie portions are absolutely huge!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic road side hot dog and fries place. Great location, just a mile away from one of the nicest beach sunsets. Try to coordinate both for a perfect evening with the kids."}
{"text":"I love Scooters. The staff is friendly. The food is so good, and I love the ice cream too. Not only are the hot dogs great, the other stuff on the menu is just as phenomenal. It's a fun little place to grab a hot dog, and some ice cream."}
{"text":"There are places to grab a quick lunch, and then there's Scooters.  Scott and Diane greet everyone like family.  I don't know many places I can dine and watch the interaction between the owners and so many guests so consistently.  He's asked : college students how their classes are going, kids how their sports are going, and other people how their families are doing (and not just a broad question, Scott remembers specific team names and family members.  French fries are cut and come out heaping on the tray.   A small feeds 4.   Hot dogs come in three sizes, short, foot long, and homewrecker.  There are topping suggestions or create your own dog."}
{"text":"I had an ice cream hot fudge sundae that was fabulous. Even though they were busy they didn't pay attention to filling the napkin dispensers or cleaning up spilled food from the floor and the garbage cans were over flowing. Very very busy place."}
{"text":"Generous portions and one of the best burgers I've ever had. Prices are just as wonderful for my wallet. My only complaint is the limited seating and parking space, but given the size of the place it's no surprise. Overall a great summertime destination!"}
{"text":"The Hawaiian dog is the best. And they have Superman ice cream! The bag of fries is fun, but make sure you bring a friend to share them with because even the small option is quite a lot. Sometimes there is a pretty long wait, but just don't go there in a rush and it will be worth it in the end. The staff is very friendly and it seems most of the customers understand how busy they typically are, so it's not like standing in line at the BMV or anything. It's a nice place to go for a summertime snack!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sandwich place in the area ! Of course they are known for their dogs but the three meat burger is to die for. The fries are awesome. Fresh cut and more than you can eat. A small order feeds two hungry people. The people that own and work here are the best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy summer treat. First time here, not sure why I've never been before! I had the slaw dog, which was topped with coney sauce, brown mustard and cole slaw. It was really good, loved the hot dog, very flavorful, good quality. Fresh cut fries were pretty good - serving sizes are huge. We got the small and had some left over between the two of us. Also tried the beer battered onion rings - very crispy, really good.   I definitely recommend -this is the perfect place to stop for a snack after day at the beach (Headlands is right down the street). They also sell burgers and chicken sandwiches and have a great selection of ice cream/sundaes/etc. as well."}
{"text":"They have the best hotdogs and fries !!!!!!!!!! OH and if you are a burger person they have a three meat that is awesome ! Don't forget that if there is not 4 or more in your party a small fry is more than enough!"}
{"text":"Oh, please, people, restrain yourselves. Scooter's hot dogs are weak. And the fries are a hideous gimmick -- the smallest size is enough for a family of four at least. Just want a normal order? Too bad, Scooter's doesn't care.  The guy behind the counter is kinda grouchy, and not in a fun, no-soup-for-you way.   They've got an outside window for orders, and they'll take your order for food as well as ice cream there -- but they don't tell you that if you want food, you'll still have to wait inside the cramped, noisy, not-completely-clean interior.   The Chicago dogs are not in any way, shape or form real Chicago dogs, but that pretty much goes without saying around here.  Gets an extra star because the ice cream concoctions are decent. I've gone here a few times, because I keep seeing all these rave reviews and thinking it must be better than I thought. Then I get disappointed all over again."}
{"text":"Wow!  Definitely NOT health food but oh so worth going off the wagon!!!  ;) It's been around 6 years that we've been coming to Scooter's for our annual \"Home Wrecker\" hot dog with medium order of their homemade fries (enough to feed a family of 8)!  Yes, I said a medium order!!!  The Home Wrecker hot dog makes the footlong look like 8 inches and it comes in as many styles as Jay Leno has cars!!  I had the Slaw Dawg with tasty slaw overflowing the boat my dog came in, and my hubby ordered the Coney Dawg with Chili!  Both were top dawg!!!  We'd frequent Scooters more often, but we do enjoy being able to fit into our bathing suits in order to go for a post-dawg swim at Headlands.  My mother used to tell me to wait an hour after eating before swimming!  Because the dogs are so big and the fries so abundant, you should probably wait until the next day!!!  Also, be forewarned, if you order anything labeled \"spicy\", believe it!  You don't want a post Scooter's revengeful visit by Montezuma!  Oh, and make sure you sample the ice cream--it's a dream!  Anybody who pays Cleveland a visit should add Scooter's to their itinerary!  It's more than a meal...it's a blast of an experience! And an hour later, especially if you had a Chili Dawg, you might enjoy the blast a second time!  ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've lived in Ohio all my life, and have never heard or been. I stumbled upon it just looking for somewhere to grab lunch quick. Let me start by saying the concept here is perfect! It's exactly what I picture when I walk into a hot dog shop! They have every combination of hot dog you could want. Plus I love that they offer different sizes and kinds of dogs. Their French fries are amazing and fresh and the size of the portions, are let me just say HUGE! This is a great place, staff is very friendly, nice and welcoming. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I spent a week in Mentor in 2011 and had the Fiesta Dog for three days straight.  I have since lived in Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and now California and I've never had a better dog. This is so far, the best hot dog I've ever had. Ever. The fact that the owner remembered my wife and I both times we came back is just icing on the cake. Keep up the good work!  Update: I live in Chicago now and nothing here tops these guys! Best in the world."}
{"text":"This place is great! We were in Euclid for business and a friend had told us about this place. We have been there twice and both times is was terrific. My husband loves the Hawaiian Dog. The fries are fresh cut and the portions are huge. A JR portion is enough for two people. The gentleman who owns this place is so nice. If you are in the area you should go!"}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of relaxed beach hot dog stand. I love it and every time I got the parking lot is full with a line out the door. They have a great selection of hot dogs, sandwiches/burgers, and if you go, you MUST get their fries (beware, the portions are huge). The owner is really nice and you feel like you're in on a local secret when you come."}
{"text":"For a small family owned hot dog place, this place has pulled out all the stops. As soon as you enter the place, the artwork grabs your attention. Whether it be the vintage license plates on the wall, or the hand painted town covering the walls, this place looks amazing on the inside. The employees are always super friendly, and go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your experience.  The Portions are HUGE too. A junior size order of french fries is plenty enough for one person. A small could feed an entire family. Unique toppings on their hot dogs, and a great ice cream selection. Only open in the summer months, so grab it while you can!"}
{"text":"We try to make at least 1 trip to Mentor Headlands every year, and Scooter's is always a must-visit when we do. I went for the first time in 2004 and the food has been consistently wonderful ever since.  Pretty much everything is perfect about this place--the hot dogs are delicious and there's a hot dog for just about every palate. I usually go for the Taco Dog, which is loaded with jalapenos, tortilla chips, taco sauce, and other toppings. The portions are enormous--my wife and I can barely finish a small fries! Desserts are delicious too--the Dirt and Worms sundae is amazing. They have a number of picnic tables outside, and eating their delicious food outside is a great way to end a pleasant day at the beach. The prices are very reasonable too--the most expensive footlong hot dog is under $5.00!  All in all, Scooter's is a great place to go. I just wish it were a bit closer to Cleveland so that I could go more often!"}
{"text":"Really great food the owners nice. If you get frys which you should because they are worth it, get a small because you will still have leftovers they pile them so high. I usually get a small and there is enough to feed 4 adults. The hotdogs are good plenty of topping options as well as specials the regular for us good and the foot long is decent but the homewrecker is a massive dog. It's one giant dog where do you find buns for these lol. They have good burgers too also chicken tenders for the kiddos and  icecream and Malts made to order nothing like taking this out to headlands beach for lunch. Which is right down the road. Come here and try it you won't be disappointed. There is limited indoor seating but tables outside if the wathers bad an insides filled up which is common it's best to get your order to go. It's usually always packed ifanything says how good it is that would be it never see this place quiet."}
{"text":"Best dogs in town!  The owner is so pleasant and helpful! The Chicago dog is spot on the the ones in chi town!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What an experience and great food and service!  Try it all, it is all great!  But remember, when ordering fries, see how much they give you!  The fresh cut fries are outstanding and they give you a heaping load of them!!"}
