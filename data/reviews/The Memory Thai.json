{"text":"After a hour and a half waiting on delivery, I called many times with no answer. I'm glad I didn't use a credit card."}
{"text":"Ordered online with Yelp 24 app. Food was cold, looks like it was reheated definitely not freshly made. Very disappointed, we just wanted to have some late night food delivered but apparently this can't be done in Vegas. At least not from this place! Just threw away $30 for no reason. Don't order from this place you will be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for dinner through GrubHub from here, and it showed up a few minutes earlier than scheduled, which was a pleasant surprise! Fresh, delicious, and hot on delivery, and they even threw in a free side of fried shrimp rolls. I will absolutely order from them again! Chicken pad Thai, orange chicken with rice, and fried shrimp rolls made up tonight's order. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Delicious hole in the wall place! I've ordered twice now & I loved it. Pad se ew, pad Thai, orange chicken & basil fried rice were all yummy. Not a looker from the outside but the food tastes authentic & I would definitely order again"}
{"text":"1 start because that's the lowest they allow you! this place is absolutely horrible!   i ordered shrimp pad thai and pot stickers and it was $27.... the guy said it was gonna be 45 min. well it took them 1:20 min to delivery the food when i live 10min from this place...  now the food was horrendous, the pot stickers were cold and hard. and the pad thai was one the worse thing i ever ate.. i ask for shrimp and they gave me chicken, and the pad thai it self was disgusting it taste it like dirty water, no flavor at all, we ended up throwing it away after wating 1:20hr!! never againg..."}
{"text":"I processed my order through GrubHub. One hour later, my order still had not arrived. I called the restaurant and no one answered. The mailbox was full so I opted to leave my call back number. 30 minites later I hear nothing, I call GrubHub customer service to submit an investigation on this. They called the reataurant multiple times over the course of one hour and there were no answers. Grubhub and I decided that after nearly 3 hours, I should just cancel the order. If this was based on the food and physical place, I wouldn't know what to say, but the customer service surely needs some improvement. I read other reviews on this place, apparently im not the only one who had problems with delivery. I may try the place one more time because I believe in second chances, but I will just dine in instead of delivery."}
{"text":"My order number was  1386917090 VIA grub hub from the memory Thai restaurant. The order took 1.5+ hours to get to us. Got here almost at 2am. We ordered egg rolls and fried rice and pad Thai. All of the items were bad in quality and taste. As if they were cooked poorly or it had been sitting out all day was very old looking and tasting. When I called customer service to reach out to them through GrubHub the restaurant refuse to re-frund and only offered 10% off. I asked for a full refund because we did not eat hardly any of our food. We spent $40 on only three items. The restaurant again refused to issue a refund for their old awful food. I will never order through this restaurant again. This was extremely unprofessional & disguising, unacceptable food quality."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the second time , Justin was very friendly and helpful . The fried rice and egg rolls were amazing . I will order Again"}
{"text":"I am surprised at the bad for the memory. I came here 2 weeks ago and am just getting to review it. I heard of them because they sent me a flyer of their lunch specials which is only $5.95, from 11am to 5pm. It includes an egg roll and drink if you stay to eat there however they were nice enough to give us both the egg roll when it was take-out, they didn't have to. Coming in there, it was empty, this lady immediately greeted us and we told her we would be taking out and she gave us a menu. Idk if they had the heater on but it was so cold inside, just as cold as outside. My bf and I both opted for the chicken pad sew lunch special. When giving the lady the order, she had a hard time understanding us and vice-versa. It was really hard to tell her I didn't want onions in my food but within 3 minutes she understood. This was the only bad part but her great service and food made up for it definitely.  The food came out in less than 10 minutes. The lady had labeled which one had onion and which one didn't, and she gave us egg rolls which we weren't expecting. The portions where a good size enough to fill me and my bf up for only $5.95! I didn't even finish it all of it, i almost did but I was so full. And OMG it was delicious! I was impressed and we both thought it tasted better than other pad sew and for the price I am so happy we discovered this place. It is about 10 minutes away from my house but it is so worth it, I would recommend it to anyone, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Lao / Laotian / Thai restaurant in Las Vegas . The dishes are always cooked fresh , down to the rice . The staff / owner of this place is very polite and kind.   Every time i order on grub hub , they always make it a point to read the instructions on when i ask to make the dishes as \" AUTHENTIC \" as possible down to the last detail . I notice that whenever they exceed the hour mark of delivery it's because it's during rush hour when people order late night and for dinner . HOWEVER the food ALWAYS comes fresh. Never once have i had an order that tasted like i was sitting there for a day or two . This is my go to , most authentic and fresh food in Vegas. Reminds me of my parents / grandparents cooking from back home in San Diego .   If you order  make sure you try the Sai Our , and the Thai style chicken and papaya salad . Ask for it to be made authentic . Egg rolls are always fresh . And their Thai tea is PERFECT .    :)"}
{"text":"Food is not good at all. Ordered spring rolls and its saggy. Fried rice needs more flavor and ingredients   Giving 2 stars for effort.  Will not order here again"}
{"text":"Have ordered through Grub Hub twice here. First time was Excellent!. Yellow Curry was awesome. Lots of chicken and great spices. Price was a little high, but it was through Grub Hub so can't really complain. Second time ordered Red Curry. It wasn't anywhere near as good as the Yellow. Spicing was not right. (I'm a HUGE Curry fan,and being a former Flight Attendant have had it in almost every state in US as well as abroad, so I'm pretty good at telling what spices are used). However, the egg rolls were awful. I don't know what was in them, but didn't look, smell or taste edible. They were soggy and a total waste of money. Have had better Thai here in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is fairly hard to find. It is next to Rent A Wheel.  For the hour we were there, we were the only customers in the building. We were the dinner crowd I think. The ambiance inside has the feeling they do 99% take-out, although there is ample seating.  This place seems to be a comedy of errors. Tons of errors and typos on the menu.  Tried to order the Combo Fried Rice - was in the picture - and they said they never heard of such a thing and do not sell it.   We had the flyer and showed to them the \"All you can eat\". They never heard of that either.  Ordered the Tom Ka Gai. It had all the required ingredients. I would rate it a solid B.  Pineapple fried rice - I am not a yellow curry fan. With that being said we ate our fair share of it.  My wife liked the cucumber salad (after it was taken back to fix after the hair in it).  She also ordered the Thai broccoli. It did not say chinese broccoli, but not complaining.  The whole experience felt as though I had an Asian mother cooking for me. Maybe not a chef, but Mom was feeding me a decent meal. Was the food authentic Thai? I am guessing the owner is from Thailand. Was it tasty? Passable.   I would not say I hated the experience. It was quite funny how the restaurants' mannerisms are, and I think everyone should experience this. I would not actively seek going here again on purpose."}
{"text":"Ordered food late at night through grubhub. Waited two hours and nobody showed. Called them today and was told that they had called to confirm. I received NO phone call or voicemail and wasted two hours starving. Poor customer service when I spoke to them about it. If they supposedly called then why didn't they leave a message and say they weren't going to deliver? No excuse to waste a customers time, especially when they're willing to pay for all the extra delivery fees. And when they're starving!"}
{"text":"We have ordered food from my work two times now for our monthly office staff meetings and the food that The Memory Thai delivers us is simply delicious Thai food at its best plus the affordable menu selections. Mind you, this is delivered. Usually, when food is delivered it doesn't quite taste as good as when you dine-in but they make sure the food that they bring to you is hot, juicy, delicious and fresh. We got very excited when our boss said that he will have us order from this place.  They have a good lunch special menus that run everyday and every dish on this list is good. You could not go wrong with their selections.  I urge everyone of you, locals and visitors alike to try this amazing place out because they will not disappoint. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Hey I'm still waiting for my food y'all and you guys Anit answering your phone so I gotta write on Yelp to talk to you guys it's been two hours and the delivery time said 45-60 minutes wait.are you guys coming"}
{"text":"Ordered off of GrubHub and the delivery was 30 past the later estimate for delivery which was very frustrating because it was already an hour estimate from time of order which is a very long wait. I got the chicken drunken noodle and chicken tom yum soup. They are both pretty good, the noodles were just fairly oily, too much grease and both were a tad too salty too, which is always my fear in ordering any Asian dishes, especially Thai food. Not sure I would order from them again, but I did ask for a discount because the delivery was so late so I got 20% off the order."}
{"text":"Awesome service good food good prices. Funny location next to these purrfect auto service very small family owned Asian restaurant pad thai was to die for"}
{"text":"Today is New Years Eve 2017 and we ordered 4 lunch plates from Eat 24/7 from The Memory Thai delivery and by far the prices are way worth it for the amount of food you receive and very tasty. Our food was delivered on time by a friendly male driver .......And I recommend this place ........"}
{"text":"Food is bland I ordered spicy and was not spicy Thai tea was ok crab Rangoon no taste either wouldn't recommend delivery even if only Thai restaurant open better to wait for good restaurant to open"}
{"text":"Love this place! Spectacular customer service + delicious food!!! Can't beat that combination. We went for the Basial fried rice, the mixed veggies,  the thai fries rice, the fried shrimp,  the wontons, AND thai tea --- everything was perfect! Highly recommend and will be going back :)"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have ordered twice via postmates so we decided on it for date night we love the place, the service is amazing, and food amazing as well very hospitable"}
{"text":"Yeah, wish these reviews showed up on Seamless. Took two hours for food to finally arrive. It wasn't very good. Egg rolls were bland, curry was not spicy. But at least it was cold."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  We had combination fried rice, mixed vegetables and red curry with chicken.  Each dish was great and we have enough food left over for another meal tomorrow.   Our server was also the cook and the buser. No problem though it was a slow night and he took great care of us."}
{"text":"Ordered in for delivery. Food came half opened. Wonton Soup was the WORST. Very gummy. The Egg Rolls were soggy. Im afraid to try the Shrimp Fried Rice *YIKES* My 1st and last experience."}
{"text":"There open 24 hrs Love there food especially the Thai Rice and Tom Yum!They have lots of specials from lunch which includes the steam rice and good price."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here through Eat24 many times.  Could not tell from the menu that the tofu is all fried, but it is not greasy like most fried tofu.  These people are so friendly and they always accommodate all of my special requests with no hassle at all.  I haven't asked yet if I could get the tofu dishes w/raw tofu, but I am sure they would do so if asked.  The curry is absolutely delicious!!!  I am a big fan of curry and theirs is yummy.  I always order the large sizes because I am always craving more the next day.  I usually get the yellow or green but tried the Panang curry last time and it was really flavorful and delicious.  Veggie soup is flavorful and packed full of fresh veggies; so soothing and nutritious, I order this if I am not feeling well.  The rice is always fresh and the cucumber salad is perfect but could be a bigger serving.  I usually order around 8 or 9 at night and the food has always arrived within one hour.  I will definitely continue to order here."}
{"text":"Sadly I don't know how the food tastes because after it took 2 hours to arrive, I sent the driver away. Won't be getting a second chance."}
{"text":"Found this hole in wall Thai restaurant near my house. Ordered shrimp pad Thai. It's a big portion and jumbo size shrimp. Also had the sweet basil chicken wings. Very tasty and good!  Their Thai tea is really good too!!!!! Hard to find, since it's tucked in the corner next to a auto body shop."}
{"text":"Eh... Food was ok. I ordered orange chicken which didn't taste all that fresh. I also got pad see ew which didn't look how I expected it to. There were a bunch of veggies in it, it was a clear/white sauce not brown and there were no peanuts. There was also cilantro in it. The flavor was yummy, but definitely didn't taste like every other Ive had in the past.   I had egg rolls which were good, but did taste like premade frozen ones and the shrimp appetizer which was really good. They use fairly large shrimp.  All in all, it wasn't terrible....plus, it is 24 hr  delivery (I ordered at 1:30am) anywhere in Vegas and there's no delivery charge."}
{"text":"Got the Combo appetizer (egg rolls, shrimp rolls, wontons and rangoons)-perfect size for a few of us and fried golden brown.   Main dishes: Red Shrimp Curry (level 2 of heat out of 3) which was served with White rice and Shrimp & Chicken Pad Thai (also level 2 of heat) great spices creating the perfect flavors.  Definitely coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I liked the egg roll more! haha. But the Thai was good. It's good for take out. Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom yesterday and she was skeptical because she has become more and more picky as the years go by with food. One thing she does not like is when Thai food has sugar in it.She ordered the Pad Seew lunch special and unfortunately, the sauce already has sugar in it. When I tasted it, it wasn't too sweet in my opinion. My mom said it was okay. We also ordered Fried Tofu appetizer which were plump, crispy and delicious. I ordered the Pad Prik King with Tofu and i loved it. Love their eggrolls also. I don't eat meat and to be honest, I don't remember it having meat in there like a previous reviewer mentioned. I am actually looking forward to eating here again because I want to try the Tom Yum Fried Rice and some Northern Thailand dishes. YUM! I love when thai places have a variety and things that others do not have. I didn't even see if they have Som Tam Laos style because I normally need that. I don't understand why there were so many reviews saying how disgusting it is. Maybe they changed, maybe people don't know how to judge Thai food or maybe it was due to the delivery service. I won't get anything delivered seeing those reviews LOL. Service was great also. Overall, my mom also liked it and she especially liked the lunch special price. I loved how their lunch special was available until 5PM."}
{"text":"Alittle far from my place.But the tasta good.I like the thai fries rice. And finally i don't eat burger and pizza in evening. I get another choice. I'll try deliverly next time."}
{"text":"Tried it for lunch and the food was pretty bad. Ordered  yellow curry chicken lunch, medium spicy. It came way too spicy and even worse the spice came from red pepper flakes. I have eaten at a minimum of 50 Thai restaurants plus tons of home made food in the casino break room and have seen red pepper flakes maybe a handful of times in Thai food, and 3 of those times its been here in Vegas, not my favorite thing. They get a star because it was edible and didn't make me sick, plus the Thai Tea was good and so was the water, which I have found in Vegas isn't always the case."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Worst Thai food I've had in Vegas. Not only did it take forever to be delivered the food was bland, poorly prepared and cold. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT. I'm not sure how they're still in business. Grubhub should remove them from their distributor list, it is slandering their name. Completely grossed out."}
{"text":"I eat out 5 nights a week. And have for years. This was among the top 5 worst meals i have ever had. Absolutely nauseating food.   I cannot believe how disgusting this was. The crab rangoon was:   (a) not cooked properly, terribly undercooked (b) *literally* the greasiest food I have ever, no joke, EVER had in my entire life--I held up one of them and it drip drip dripped! (c) fried in oil that was absolutely grotesque tasting (d) filled with \"stuff\" beyond description---in a really bad way--like cottage cheese with fishy tasting slimy fake fish.    The fried wontons were also absurdly oily, and only a tiny tidbit of chicken filling inside, which was was dryer than a day in June, and more tasteless than a tramp stamp.  The Tom Kha Gai soup was that only in name. I don't know what it was in reality. Some kind of coconut sludge chock to the brim with -again- grotesquely fried tofu. What the heck?   I am feeling ill after having put any of this pig swill in my body. Needless to say, much of it went straight to trash.  Absolutely FOUL food and a $5 delivery fee to boot.   And feeling like an idiot for wasting $30 to have such crud delivered to me."}
{"text":"I ordered kung pao tofu, got kung pao chicken. I'm vegetarian so I couldn't eat my meal. Upon further inspection I found stickers left on several of the green pepper slices. will not be returning"}
{"text":"Had some food delivered, it was delicious,  red curry was perfect and the pad thai was great.  Better than some other thai restaurants,  this one is our new fav...."}
{"text":"Wow, really disappointed tonight. And I tipped the guy $5!!! Tom kha soup was totally BLAND. And I mean BLAND, I've never had a soup so tasteless. No lemon grass, NADA! The orange chicken dinner had no veggies or rice mixed in with it (which is really strange to me since most restaurants do.) The crab rangoon's were ok but don't expect the sweet & sour sauce, instead it comes with a tiny little cup (half & half size) of some other sauce (which isn't bad but it's not a generous portion & way too small to dip them in). Good prices on the Thai tea but I wish they'd make a dairy free version.   So there's my rant. Hate to leave a one star review but when I spend $40 for food I expect it to be better than this!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Flavorful! & they have 24hr delivery service to ANYWHERE in las vegas! Definitely going to be ordering here more often.  Only bad thing i could say is that the driver took a very long time to get here. I ordered at 10:30pm (& they close at 11pm so I was giving them the benefit of the doubt for being a lil late) and my food didn't get here until about midnight. I was scared they weren't coming but they did :)  I ordered the Shrimp Fried Rice and Chicken See-Ew. See-Ew is probably going to be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Well this is false advertising it is suppose to be 24/7 and open 24hrs a day. So this is not the case, I would of gave them a better rating but they were closed.  So we will see if I give them another chance."}
{"text":"Ordered drunken noodles with beef. A tad on the salty side. I would order again but request less salt and the portion size was great and there was a good amount of beef which was tasty. The shrimp fried rice was tasty and I enjoyed the basil. The tea was too sweet, I have to agree with another Yelper, however it was yummy nonetheless.  I'm surprised at the low reviews because I thought the food was solid. The fact that you can get food at 1:00am and get your Thai fix on is enough to garner an extra star."}
{"text":"The food was tolerable..friendly staff also. They delivered within 45 minutes as was told. Taste for pricing: I wasn't too pleased. For a 24 hour delivery I wouldn't expect too much more than what I did. One negative thing is that I specified wanting sweet and sour and teriyaki sauce and they forgot but that wasn't a deal breaker I just wasn't crazy for the taste. Paid about 40 dollars for two combo plates."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We ordered Chicken Pad See Ew and Drunken Noodles(Chicken), spicy level 6 both of them and our food was awful. We literally had zero flavor but the piles and piles of crushed red pepper flakes on the food. We had to cover it in soy sauce that luckily we had at the house. The food was very bland and no flavor, never again. Waited an Hour and a Half for old, bland and plain food covered in red pepper flakes."}
{"text":"Took an hour for delivery, as promised.  Food was good.  Price was good.  Ordering online through Eat24 was simple and easy.  And it was open on July 4th.  Others weren't."}
{"text":"It may be off the beaten path, but they are very friendly. Awesome food! Great prices! Wanton Noodle soup is so good! We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was handed a flier a week back at my other job. It stated \"all you can eat wings\" lunch $6.95 11 am - 3 pm and dinner $8.95 3pm - 9 pm dine in only. Both included steam rice, salad & soup. It also didn't state an expiration date!  We came from the I95 from the Stratosphere since we couldn't criss Las Vegas Blvd due to the marathon.  Passed it since we were expecting their lit up sign but luckily my partner has really good eye sight. Their signage was a 4 foot banner.   Place looked closed but the sign was flashing \"open\". Once we stepped in, the older Thai gentleman approached and greeted us. He also turned on a set of lights.  Not a very busy place. Now we know why!   My partner and I ordered two Thai teas with boba! Came back with no boba, gentleman did mention there wasn't any more boba when he served us the drink. Now I'm a firm believer,  if you have items on the menu, you need to have a steady supply in the establishment. It was in a tall glass, too bad it was too sweet!  I ordered a combination shrimp & chicken pad Thai,  no onions, since my partner is allergic. Flavor and portion size were just right for the price. It's creamier than most pad Thai I've ever had though.  Soyp or salad never made it to the table. Then the chicken wings came. I ordered a sweet chili sauce and my partner a spicy sweet basil. A heat level of seven. Chicken wings were dry. I had to double dip mine in the sauce just to swallow the meat jerky. My partners wings were flavoured perfectly but still on the dry side.  You get 7 wing sections tossed in the sauce (sweet chili, drunken chili, sweet basil) and a cup of rice. Thr flier I was given had garlic pepper as another sauce that I didn't see on the store menu. Ten minutes go by, sat for another 3, and finally the older gentleman came and handed our check!  What? So I asked if we can get another order, thinking it was all you can eat! Boy was I shocked when they said that flier expired. So I pretty much paid $9.95 for 7 wings and a cup of rice? It was $7.95 on the store menu but you add $2 more for tofu or chicken and $3 more for shrimp. Who does that? So if I'd pay $7.95, what would we have served, a cup of rice, the sauce on top of shredded cabbage? If I would have known I'd just went to hamburger hut! I do live in North Vegas so it wouldn't have been any inconvenience. I would have got 10 wings for $8.99 and half a to go container full of fries, soaked in sauce & juicy. Guess that's why I get for trying to support local businesses!  Never trust a restaurant with no customers!  If it weren't for the older Thai gentleman I'd gave this place 1 star!  Someone mentioned the shrimp in the pad Thai was a \"jumbo\" size, let's not fool anyone else, it's only a 31/40 peeled, deveined & tail on. \"Jumbo\" would be considered as the langostine size and it would have cost more than $15 for the dish, not $7.95! Just saying!      Next"}
{"text":"**DO NOT EAT HERE!!!** We found this place on seamless and I can say this was the worst Thai food we've ever had. We ordered take-out from here once before and after processing our order they closed and we still have not received a refund. We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and order again... Big mistake. We ordered 3 shrimp Pad Thai plates and couldn't get past 2 bites. The shrimp tasted like it was microwaved, the food was cold, the noodles were hard and they only gave us 2 soy sauce packets. We contacted the owner and he refused to gives us any type of refund or compensation. Our total was $56 according to the restaurant yet my bank statement says I was charged $68.   If you plan on eating Thai food I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere. Of course if you prefer terrible customer service, nasty food and being robbed by a business... This is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"Food literally had no flavor. The wonton soup, had no wontons because they were all in pieces by the time I got my soup. Not only that, they tasted really gross. I don't recommend eating here at all. I literally ended up spending $18.00 to just put the nasty food down the drain, such a fucking bummer."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry... worst I've had in Vegas. I want to try again for benefit of the doubt, but not necessarily looking forward to it :(("}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Ordered the pad Thai, drunken noodles and tom kha soup. Soup was thick and tasked like cream of mushroom. And the noodle dishes weren't bad but weren't great. The drunken noodles were very dry. Got free egg rolls with the order."}
{"text":"waited an hour and a half for a soup and wonton covered shrimp. so, you can imagine how soggy the wonton shrimp was by the time it got to my place, and all for 50$ because of the delivery fee.....nah. I will say that its cool they deliver so late (12a.m.) but the taste just wasn't there!"}
{"text":"this is a family owned business and I really feel they are doing great. they are open late & they are in a great location for me. definitely my late night go to spot. #PadThaiforaP"}
{"text":"Amazing home cooked thai food basically! Love the Drunken Noodle Chicken and Shrimp"}
{"text":"Yummy Food delivered on time fresh as always! Been my favorite place to order whenever i get the late night munchies and need delivery"}
{"text":"Made a late night decision to order Thai food... Not many delivering but I could've gone to a place with more stars and better reviews if I drove there but opted to give this place a shot...  The pricing was in line with other Thai places... The delivery was much quicker than the quoted time And when I left delivery instructions they followed them exactly... that doesn't always happen...  I ordered pad Thai and pad see ew.. One with shrimp and the other was combo... This is the first combo that had more than two pieces of shrimp and this is the biggest shrimp I had ever seen in a Thai dish..  This is the best pad Thai I have ever tasted... And it used to be my go to until I moved to pad see ew... because the pad Thai was so good I might be moving back when I order from here...  Also ordered was chicken Tom Yum noodle soup and although it sometimes comes in the white looking coloring because of the coconut... This came and we originally thought it might've been a mistake when you tasted it taste exactly as you expected to... A lot of ingredients and very good...   One order was at an eight of 10 spiciness and it delivered as I expected... The five out of 10 was in line as well... If you like spicy you're going to get it with this place... If you don't they make it to order... Highly recommend giving this place a chance!..."}
{"text":"This is the first visit and the staff is very attentive and friendly.  The appetizer soup and the egg roll are delicious and I had the seafood soup.   Very tasty.   I will come back to try something else"}
{"text":"Quick & tasty, what more can u ask for from Thai delivery. Very polite & extremely yummy"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Very spicy, fresh and authentic. I had the Pad Thai Sen Jan and Panang Curry with Tofu, both were delicious. Great takeout place and delivers 24/7."}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE. I would give them zero stars if i could!!!!!! They said our food would be ready in 40 minutes and then we waited an additional 45 MINUTES FOR OUR FOOD. I called and asked how much longer until we got our food and when they told me 5 minutes we waited another 20 minutes for them to get here!!!! So when the driver finally arrived he told is there was \"traffic\". So even though our food was still hot when he arrived..... he is stating he waited in 40 minute traffic???? Yeah right. Honestly???? Worst experience ever. The food is mediocre at best. OH ALSO, don't order through Grubhub!!! They deliver it themselves and only order through Grubhub so they can charge you the delivery fee!!!! This place SUCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Paid for extra noodles and got very little. It was 70% chucks of tofu . Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow!  This is some of the best Thai food I've ever had!!  So impressed!  The panang curry and vegetable fried rice was amazing!  Super fresh! Crab Rangoon full of crab cheese! Even the presentation was impressive for delivery!  Great Job!!!"}
{"text":"The curry is always yummy, my veggies are always fresh and good too. they deliver later than most places so its worth the wait times off of grub hub. Have ordered from here many times."}
{"text":"After having to wait an additional 20 min longer then what I was told. With anticipation I brought dinner home for the family...here's the review; The beef Salad=not good at all! Yellow curry=very tasty but extremely runny. Green Curry=not bad just lacked in protein content. Penang Curry= sauce/seasoning was delicious but how are there frozen chicken pieces? I'm not talking about room temperature due to the drive home..I'm talking frozen chicken! The veggie egg rolls were the crowd favorite along with the Thai soup. Overall I'd say 2/5 stars. If you are in a what the heck let's try this place out mood like my family and I were last night then this is your place. But if you are looking for traditional Thai prepared and cooked with out shortcuts then try an alternative"}
{"text":"I give them no stars I ordered delivery  Orange chicken- that didn't have chicken even inside of it just a tiny piece it was like eating just the batter. Chicken pad Thai- no taste at all noodles dry the chicken taste old that was dry also just gross Combination fried rice- I don't know if I've ever had bad fried rice Panda Express is wayyy better than this place the rice was hard and chicken was dry the shrimp taste old just gross and we spent $45 plus a good tip so so so disappointed I wouldn't reconnect this place to no one!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has anything less than 5 star reviews. The food is delicious and they always deliver on time. One of the best chicken Satay in Vegas. The curry is amazing!"}
{"text":"The Memory Thai is amazing. They've become my go-to for late night delivery whether I'm at work or home.   Always delivered within the time limit provided.  Their food is always good. Healthy proportions, more than enough for leftovers or feeding more than yourself and another.   Noodle dish's are very good. Not oily at all. The crab Rangoon is superior. Very full little pouches full of tasty goodness. Excellent veggie to meat to noodle ratio.   Their Thai tea, for delivery is spot on. Two sizes 20oz and a 32oz. Holy Cow Batman! My daughter and I split the 32. More than enough.   I can't fathom the reason for bad reviews. 10 out of 10 they've been amazing.  Do if you haven't already give them a try!"}
{"text":"At lunch time there was no body in the place ... Thank gosh ... the staff was very kind ... Ordered $ 7.00 Yellow Curry (spice leve of 5) with chicken ... Was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!!   Another great restaurant find in the neighborhood!  HIGHLY recommend this establishment.  Very inexpensive for quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"I've ordered food before and it was good. The last delivery was late and the food tasted like freezer burn. I asked eat24 for a refund and told them I didn't eat the food and they could replace it or refund it and they only refunded 50 percent. Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"I order from here about once a week, my go to for Thai food. I love the green curry, but have also tried the red and panang.   The Tom Yum and Tom Kha are great soups.   The Fried Shrimp Combo is delicious and comes with a good amount of tempura shrimp and broccoli, fried rice, an egg roll and a soda. (although the soda was forgotten in my last order)  I'm also a fan of the Thai Basil Fried Rice or even just the Thai Fried Rice. Delicious flavors.  I would not recommend the orange chicken, just stick to the soups, curries and rices!   Sometimes they throw in extra egg rolls or a soda so that's always a nice little surprise. Delivery is decent. My food is always ready or just about ready when I pick up."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this restaurant before with no problems and the food was delicious. But recently, I've attempted to order from here 3 or 4 times now, and each time I've ordered, my order was cancelled due to there being NO DELIVERY DRIVER. If the restaurant doesn't have a delivery driver at certain hours, the restaurant SHOULDN'T be up on the site for customers to order and have to go through this each and every time we try to order."}
{"text":"Ummmm. Yeah. Delivery dude showed up and tried to give me chicken pad Thai and 3 cans of Pepsi for the $25+ I spent. Awwwwe, hell naww. I told him NO. In a horrible, barely-existent English question, he asked if I ordered the Tofu Pad Thai and the appetizer sampler? I said yes. He said he had mixed up my order with the stop before mine. So he gave my food to someone else. He doesn't check the bag when dropping it off?  So 25+ bucks for something I didn't order?"}
{"text":"After waiting 2-1/2 hours for our food to be delivered through grub hub... maybe I would have preferred it had never arrived at all.   The curry arrived with the vegetables in the container and the liquid in a bag. Aside from a slight plasticity taste, it was alright. Get back to me in the morning and I'll let you know if my stomach agrees.   The drunken noodles were completely sober and probably just cardboard sprinkled with pepper. I'm talking bone dry.   The tom kha had hair in it and a few other ingredients I wasn't expecting.   The vegetarian egg rolls had (chicken?) meat in them.   This might actually be the worst $50 I've ever spent. Ever."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here through grub hub. I put the tip in advance, so I don't know if that makes a difference. Worse food ever! NEVER again will I order from here. No taste!!!! Bland noodles, yuk. Not worth the $75"}
{"text":"Liars,  So it is Christmas Day (well not anymore...it's 30 mins past midnight), we ordered our food at around 10:20 PM. We called asking where our food was, they said they didn't receive our order (really though?) When I presented him with the order number he proceeded to tell me they didn't accept cash, even though it was an option on eat24. I get it, it's Christmas and you don't want to deliver to my neighbor at night; don't lie about your policies. Rest assured, I will be letting Eat24 know about your new payment policies. Don't promote bad buisness."}
{"text":"I have never tried Thai food before coming to this place gave me a whole new perspective the food is very healthy taste absolutely delicious I would definitely refer this restaurant to any of my friends or family I understand the full meaning of their name the memory because the food is so good it leaves a memory thank you guys keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tom Kha soup and an order of Crab Rangoon. The order was slightly late, only about 6-7 minutes, which I dont mind because I was pretty far away and STOKED that they even delivered that distance! But I have got to say, they have the BEST CRAB RANGOON I have EVER tasted in my life. It was like a crab rangoon stuffing in a beignet! It was flaky, tasty, cooked JUST RIGHT... and an order of six was cheap and each one is BIG! They've won my approval on the rangoon alone, and the Tom Kha was tasty as well!"}
{"text":"I got the lunch special and they conveniently forgot to give me a free egg roll and I didn't realize till I got home. It's not the fact that they forgot it's about the principal. If you advertise a free egg roll, don't forget the free egg roll. I'll update my review if there service improves."}
{"text":"I normally order from here late at night because it's the only place that's open and delivers . The food i decent,  i like all the tofu options but they are incredibly inconsistent with their hours.  Its suppose to be 24/7 , it in the name. But its not.  Ive been notified before that they were close and today i ordered from them , was sent a confirmation by eat24 saying the food would arrive in and hour and a half ( that's a while  , but ok ) 2 hours later i call them , no answer,  voicemail box is full. Im starving. Not ok."}
{"text":"I've ordered the orange chicken once before and it was nothing to write home about although they aren't stingy with their portions.. this time i chose the chicken thai garlic and it's pretty decent.. don't think I'd order it again but their thai tea is the reason for 3 stars.. must have.!!"}
{"text":"Based on what I saw, and tasted, this is an above average place for Thai food. Granted, not a gourmet meal. Went in and ordered my food for takeout. No experience with delivery.  Ordered the chicken pad thai, with a spice rating of 5, on a scale of 10. The flavor itself was somewhat sweet and not overly spicy. For most Thai food, middle of the spice range is more than adequate, but not in this case. There was a short burst of spiciness after was done, but went away quickly.  Will plan on coming back but ordering slightly spicier version. Recommend this place, at least for takeout. Took only five minutes or so and pleasant interior."}
{"text":"Some of the most nastiest food ever, and had the nerve to be late and get lost, Ill never order from here again, and I will tell my family and friends not to eat from here, I did tip the driver because she was sweet and apologized for getting lost but the food was still the most nastest ever"}
