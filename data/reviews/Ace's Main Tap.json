{"text":"stopped by and it about 530pm on a Friday.  nice bunch of folks here. has has the classic small town tavern feeling. ..no pretenses. ..just a nice place to gave a beer."}
{"text":"I mean, it's a local watering hole. It's nothing fancy. But that's the point. The burgers here are great. There is one cook in particular who ALWAYS cooks them perfectly. Luckily she is manning the grill the majority of the times I go there. We love the munchies (cheesy tater tots) and onion rings. Fried mushrooms. You know...it's just good and naughty food! 
Drinks are good and decently priced. I always get a glass of wine while I wait for my to-go order and I appreciate the filled-to-the-rim pour! 
Nice music on the juke box too. Pool table in the back for those who like to play.
To sum it up, It's the perfect neighborhood tavern with bar burgers that rival any Madison bar.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, and well priced. It's a low key bar with a comfortable atmosphere. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is a four star for what they provide well.  This is a great place for cheap bar food. Nothing fancy here, just a meal under $10. Not bad for kids if you leave early."}
{"text":"If you want a dive bar with good food, the come to Ace's!  Their burger had been voted one of the best in Dane Co, and I can vouch first hand that they have earned the title rightfully so.  We have come here a couple of times for lunch and have always left happy.

Now my main issue (and the only reason I rated 3 stars) is because there are some questionable food handling practices going on in the kitchen.  When you walk in there is a long bar to the right, and right behind it in full view is the flat top grill.  Now in my opinion this is great, as I can see exactly how my food is being prepared.  But it's also not so great when the cook grabs a raw meat patty with her bare hands, slaps it on the grill, and then proceeds to go about her business without ever washing her hands.  I watched her cook my entire meal (and probably other's) without ever washing her hands or putting on gloves.  Not appealing. 

All in all it's good food, but I'm not sure the risks of getting sick from unsanitary food handling practices are worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome Sconni bar.  Classic.  Great frozen pizza, cold beer and very friendly.  Play some dice when there."}
{"text":"Just a great bar with an outstanding burger. The munchies are incredible as well! They also host a pretty nice meat raffle that is always fun, I Believe its every other Sunday but I'm not 100% sure on that haha. But defiantly check this place out of you want a good burger and I highly recommend getting an order of munchies as well."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. The woman running the bar totally lied to us and forgot to make our food. We waited over a hour for chicken strips and a burger. The service was the worst ever. Never asked if we needed anything else and after waiting for 20 minutes for the bill we had to ask for it."}
