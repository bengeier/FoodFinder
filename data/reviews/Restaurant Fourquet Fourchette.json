{"text":"I usually go to the location in Chambly but this time we were meeting some friends and came to this location. I started with the onion soup (naturally French onion soup back home) and ordered the bavette au b?uf (wow, didn't think my phone would type that letter LOL). It was delicious and was served with potatoes and an onion glaze, check the picture. I downed it with red ale Maudite and I couldn't be happier. If you have the choice though, go to the one located in Chambly, the ambiance is better. Not coincidentally all the pictures in the menu are of that location."}
{"text":"We went here for the Mtl a table week.  The menu I had was onion soup, paté chinois, and chocolate mousse, for 19$ although the onion soup was 4$ extra.  The onion soup was amazing, good flavor, served hot and tasty. It was well salted, and the onions had tons of flavor.  The paté chinois, which apparently the 2010 Debeur prize for reinvention, is a revised version of the dish...  baaaaaah!!!! don't mess with a classic!!! the only good thing from this plate was the homemade ketchup. It was pulled meat with some purée and some diced potatoes on top, not mashed. It was weird and no I did not like it, just my taste.  The dessert was chocolate mousse, it was very intensely chocolate, rich and not too sweet, but it was too small.  All in all, I liked it overall, since it was so cheap and for 23$ it's an incredible value. But would I have liked it if I came here without the Mtl a table discount? I don't know.  The food is solid here, but overall it seems that something is off, I don't know."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant qui propose un choix de produits locaux de qualité: vin, bières (unibroues par exemple), fromages (c'est là que j'ai découvert le gré des champs), viandes etc Servis sur assiettes, planche de bois ou plateau avec explications sur la provenance et la qualité par le serveur.  Une carte complète qui saura vous séduire à coup sûr!"}
{"text":"I came here as part of the MTL à table week, and my whole group very much enjoyed our dinners.  My onion soup was delicious, and my chocolate mousse was not only beautifully presented but also heavenly-tasting. The duck with beans was fine, but I wouldn't order it again, particularly couched between the insanely rich soup and mousse. Next time I'll probably order salad as a starter!  My dinner-mates said their salad, cottage pie, sausages, crème brûlée and sugar pie were also very good, though we're not really sure what made the cottage pie the major award-winner among the bunch. I can confirm that the crème brûlée was delicious, having scored a small taste myself. The perfectly crusty bread, reasonably priced Maudite pitcher, service and décor also deserve a big thumbs-up."}
{"text":"I was at Palais de Congres last week and was disappointed to find that this place has closed. There is currently nothing else in its place."}
{"text":"I thought the food here tasted great and the service was quick, especially when the place was packed with conference attendees. There is plenty to choose from in the menu and I could see myself coming back a few more times to try other menu items. I had the cottage pie and it was a full meal without being too overwhelming or heavy. They accept American Express which is nice too. There's plenty of soup and salad at your disposal while you wait for your main dish.   Be warned that it does get very loud in there and seating can be a bit cramped depending where your table is. Otherwise, enjoy!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the quintessential fancy-pants nouveau-Parisian fare, this is it.   Although the bread was not fresh-baked there was a home-made cheese-flatbread that was good. The French onion soup defines the dish and the rest of the food I had was pretty tasty, too. Part of the menu is reasonable prix-fixed fare, too, which is kind of nice when you have an expense report to fill out.  Not only do they focus on French \"traditional\" cuisine, but they mix native-American foods and twists in as well. Caribou jerky, wild rabbit and deer, and salmon round out a very large menu. I had the chocolate-mousse cake for dessert and it was scrumptious.  Given that I have kids and that the wife and them may show up here in Montreal with me one of these days I took notice of the highchairs and kids menu. It is certainly pricey for kids, with $13 kids meals. In fact, there is venison on the kids menu here(!) I think mine will stick with the chicken fingers. Given that the place can get noisy; it has a high roof for aggregating sound, it may be a good choice for kids."}
{"text":"If a place opened like this in Boston, it would be overflowing with customers. I loved the pairing of beers with the food. Staff was great as well. Unibroue and the owner should be congratulated in fusing such an unbelievable establishment!"}
{"text":"When I rave about my time in Montreal, this is another one of the places that comes to mind. As a former beer judge, naturally I am a fan of Unibroue beer. It was tantalizing to be so close to the brewery in Chambly, but alas we did not have transportation. Luckily for us, Fourquet Fourchette, which celebrates the marriage of gastronomy and beer, has a restaurant in the city, which was fairly easy to find at the Palais des Congrès. The real treat at this restaurant turned out to be the menu itself, and having all of Unibroue's beers on tap was just icing on the cake. I've already mentioned that I am a fan of game meat. Well, the menu itself was full of game, which all sounded delicious (caribou pot pie, for example), I was having a hard enough time deciding what to get. Then our server came around and told us the daily specials, and that just made the decision even harder! The daily quiche was a quiche of game meats; the daily pasta was filled with duck meat and topped with bison jus; the daily seafood was some kind of local fish I can't remember; and the daily meat special was flank steak of horse. That's right, HORSE! I love Canada so much. Anyway, Vince got the horse and I got the duck pasta topped with bison. The horse was super flavorful, I was really glad I was able to try it. I loved my pasta because it was just crammed full of meat and topped with meat juice and more meat; no space wasted on silly things like cheese and sauce. For lunch, it was actually a super good deal, because everything came with a soup and salad bar, dessert and coffee. Of course we also each got a beer sampler, which came with Blanche de Chambly, Raftman, Chambly Noire, Maudite, La Fin du Monde, and Trois Pistoles. It was nice to be able to try the Raftman and Chambly Noire, since I haven't seen these in the US and they were lower in alcohol than the other Unibroue beers. Due to its location, it seems to attract mostly a business lunch crowd from the local office buildings, rather than tourists, though the servers are in traditional costume, evoking \"the lost era of New France and its native culture.\" Our server Serge was amazingly nice and friendly, and was very helpful in suggesting places in Montreal for us to visit. We really appreciated his excellent service as well as all of the delicious food and beer. I highly recommend this place. During the week they are mostly just open for lunch; their hours are Monday to Wednesday: 11:30 to 4:00 p.m., Thursday and Friday: 11:30 to 10 p.m., Saturday: 5:30 to 10 p.m., and closed Sunday. They also have a location in Chambly."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad at all. They had a lovely Fennel and Lettuce soup. That's right, a soup of Lettuce and Fennel. I was quite impressed. The problem, for which I docked them a star, was the service. They were slow, they seemed confused by our group and sadly, they got a couple of orders wrong. Not good.   BUT...  I would recommend this place if you're at the Palais for a convention. It's easy, the place is pretty big and the food is good. I'd avoid the Caribou Pot Pie, but other than that, I thought it was lovely."}
{"text":"Fourquet Fourchette is an nifty little resto inside the Palais des Congress (Convention Center) in Montreal. While the menu is largely \"new French\" and has some interesting twists on old classics, including cooking with Unibrou beer as a primary ingredient, the food gives off the vibe of homely, French comfort food - it feels more traditional than it is.  The same goes for the restaurant as a whole. It's located inside the uber-chic uber-green uber-moderne Convention Center, but the dining area is meant to look like a Quebec countryside cabin. There's literally bundles of wheat used as decoration. The tables are long, massive slabs of mostly unfinished wood which reinforce this concept.  The service was gracious and you can tell that the proprietors take pride in not only their restaurant, but in acting as the welcome, happy face to the many tourists and convention-goers who come visit from all over the world.  Lastly, and most importantly, this is best place to get the freshest, most perfect glass of Unibroue beers on tap (Maudite, La Fin Du Monde, et. al) outside of the actual brewery, which is in Chambly about 15 miles away. So, if you can't make it out there, go here for the beer! The Maudite I had here was about 30 times better than the Maudite I'm able to procure in San Francisco. Don't ask me why..."}
{"text":"As a craft beer fan, I've been to a number of brewers' food/beer outlets and am used to a smallish spot with good food and, of course, the beer.  I was therefore quite taken aback to find that the Montreal convention center is the location for Unibroue's restaraunt.  The place is giant in terms of square footage; during our visit, a large group of 40-50 elderly folks were being entertained by a musician at long communal tables in one of two very large rooms.  We were one of two couples not associated with this group.  Needless to say, the presence of this place in a convention center near a bunch of international hotels makes the atmosphere palpably corporate and touristic.  This is what happens when Sapporo buys your brewery, perhaps.  However, we were there for the beer accompanying food and were certainly not disappointed in this respect.  Unibroue's lineup is available on tap (about seven of their beers in this way) and all are available in bottle (340 and 750mL).  Tasting flights can also be ordered.  The beer speaks for itself.  High quality, belgian-inspired beer that is well-crafted.  Some items on the beer menu are in limited distribution in the States, so it was good to have access to them.  FF, like many restos in Montreal, offers a multi-course Table d'Hote option and a slightly more comprehensive regular menu; items overlap between the two.  We ordered from the Table d'Hote menu.  Duck leg confit for me;  venison pot pie for Bridget.  The presentation was excellent, the duck was very tasty (slightly firmer than my preference, but still juicy and could be pulled apart with the fork).  Pot pie was excellent; meat was tender and savory.    The service was friendly and responsive; despite being close to closing we were not rushed.  Happily, we left with a couple of bottles from one of Unibroue's limited batches.    Would we come here again?  Perhaps.  Given Fourquet Fourchette's location (not near anything else I like and absent a real neighborhood) and (perhaps uncomfortably large) size, and the fact that Unibroue beers are easily had at smaller establishments in Montreal like Bieres et Compagnie, it may not be necessary for a repeat experience."}
{"text":"Malgré le décor médiéval et un menu intéressant offrant beaucoup d'ingrédients québécois, j'ai été décue par la qualité de la cuisine.  J'ai commandé un pot-au feu de fruits de mer qui était en d'autres mots une soupe/crème avec des fruits de mer et des pommes de terre.  Elle était incroyablement salée et les fruits de mer était si petits et à peine détectables.  Le canard de mon amie ne goûtait pas grand chose et était extrêmement gras. La salade et le dessert étaient par contre goûteux. Tout le monde sur la table a grandement apprécié le panier de pain qui incluait la banique, un pain plat et mince un peu sucré et rempli de quinoa et d'autre grains.  Et le menu de bières québécoises est également intéressant."}
