{"text":"BEWARE!   NEVER EVER EVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!! They take two hours to bring the food, they smile and accept your (generous) tip and money, then they take off quick before you can even realize that they've only delivered half the order (mind you, the food is cold and the avocados have browned by the time you recieve the order). They also throw 3 separate orders into one delivery box. Then, when you call them to complain, in my case, send back the order (yes! It was that bad), they refuse to come back and LAUGH at you because they know they just robbed you and got away with it!! Their food isn't even eatable, and after reading some of the other reviews, I am happy that I chose to not eat it... ROACHES and DEAD BUGS?? YUCK!!!  To the manager: your employee who answered the phone on Feb. 28, 2016 at 7p.m. is beyond disrespectful to paying customers. He said his name is \"Alex,\" but I'm sure he was lying. For the benefit of your restaurant, I'd consider hiring a new employee. I have never been more disappointed in a restaurant employee's customer service.  By the way, I never write reviews, but this experience was beyond terrible, and I felt the absolute need to share it with you. I can understand a delay, I can understand an order mixup, but I cannot grasp for one second such DISRESPECT and DISREGARD for a dissatisfied paying customer. Deplorable."}
