{"text":"Had a great evening and definitely will be back.  Both my friend, a Eric and I had two make your own Manhattans each and the BEST WINGS I have ever had anywhere!  Check this place out and get the wings!"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. Service was HORRIBLE (we sat at the bar and both the bartender and manager ignored us not only when we walked in but when it was time to grab our check). Food was gross and drinks were mediocre. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. I've been several times including their first week and now their first Brunch service. Opening a new restaurant from an original concept is never easy, but this establishment and staff are handling it extremely well. Not everything is perfect, but they are working out their small kinks. As a someone from South (gratuitous picture of Hat included) I like that they are incorporating different cuisines from different areas.  I've tried lots of things on the menu. The Fried Chicken is awesome and it's hard not to get it all the time. Crab Hushpuppies and Fried Okra (and sauces) are both great.   Service is good, Bar program strong and cocktails are well executed (liked Bloody and Cold Brew at Brunch this past weekend)  This concept will only get better and I really hope that the community embraces them and gives them a shot, and that the team keeps tinkering with menu items.   Regarding Brunch: it was hard to decide what to have, because I figured the Chicken and Waffles, Biscuits and Gravy and Shrimp ad Grits would all be good and I've had some of components. Went with Pigs in Blanket and I'm thrilled I did. Gravy was incredible, Johnny Cake was really good and Pork Shoulder made it stand out. Highly suggested."}
{"text":"After living in Kansas City, I had not found KC quality BBQ in Phoenix until now.  Wow, we are in love with their food and will be back often.  The hot links, pork shoulder and brisket were each wonderful and huge portions with their sampler.  My two sides, BBQ beans and roasted Brussels Sprouts with bacon were wonderful.  My wife had the fried chicken sandwich with Tennessee hot sauce and it was outstanding. A battered chicken breast, overflowing the bun with seasoned battered fries.  Even the Burger my granddaughter ordered was wonderful, with house ground meat.  The cocktails were also tasty.  Upgrade your old fashion with Four Roses for only $2.  Great meal!"}
{"text":"The food was ok and managementwas disrespectful when screwing up my order. I thi k the managers name was jessica. She had a attitude and was very rude which ruined my time and visit. If it wasnt for her attitude i would have probabily had a good time..  Bar prices are extreamly way too high. Google needs to put 5 \"$\" symbols on this causeits waay to expenaivefor such little food. Toby keiths was a better resturant."}
{"text":"Just got done eating at this place. We had the fried chicken, wings, Brussel sprouts and biscuits. First, biscuit could be it's own meal as if this was my meal, would've totally enjoyed it. The chicken and wings were fantastic. The Brussels sprouts are a must have. Best I've ever had. Ridiculously good food. Service was really good. Food came out quickly. Singer also good. Prices were extremely reasonable. Great new place with great food n service."}
{"text":"Here on vacation and received a personal invite to their soft open.  Officially opens March 04, 2018.  Had a chance to preview their farmhouse salad, smoked brisket, risotto, and mac & cheese. All were very good and found them all to be true southern cooking. Their buttermilk biscuits also very tasty.  They have (3) different home made BBQ sauces and we found them all very good although our favorite was the Carolina mustard.   A very extensive beer & top shelf liquor selection is also available.   Staff very friendly and knowledgeable.     Highly recommend to stop in and try out this place. Can not attach a menu in that it is formally not available until March 04, 2018.  We wish them the best of luck !!"}
{"text":"We just ate here and I was so excited to write this review! The atmosphere is awesome! They have tv's in the bar to watch various games, but also had live music which was made for such a fun vibe! Our server Renae was wonderful and made all sorts of yummy suggestions. We had the pastor's plate as the appetizer- a little bit of everything and each part of the plate was amazing! We over ordered by far with it being our first time and we were excited to try EVERYTHING! The Brussel sprouts- OMG so incredible the way the chef prepared them! My husband got the fried chicken sandwich and loved it- the hot bbq sauce on it was great and a good portion of meat! The fries tasted great but a little bit too much breading would literally be the only even slightly negative thing we'd say paired with the fried part of the sandwich. I had the brisket plate- the brisket was phenomenal! All the sauces they give for you to try were winners, our favorite being the spicy sauce! I had Mac n cheese as the side- so cheesy and fun presentation in a mug! The biscuit was a total winner and so flaky and buttery. We embarrassingly enough sat and watched games for long enough to even order dessert. We had the apple pie- nothing short of amazing as well- it was like having a warm bear claw with delicious vanilla ice cream! As we left, one of the sweet bartenders Nicole introduced herself to us and told us about their plans for late night menus and things. The staff and service was top notch!! We like a dangerous 10 min away and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is way too salty, Jack in the Box's pork loin is better than theirs. Also food is way overpriced, literally go anywhere else for better food. I'm never going back and I would advise not coming to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here while on vacation in Scottsdale. The place was nearly empty because it was Easter.   We got great service while there. I enjoyed one of their Old Fashions and my wife had one of their strawberry beaches cocktail.   The BBQ was all good. I had a 3 meat sampler of pulled pork, sausage, and brisket. I enjoyed all of it but really liked the sausage.   We were able to sit outdoors on a really nice night. We would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Made reservations for friday evening with belief that this will ensure a table as does other places. My brother arrived 1st and called to say no reservation needed bcz the place has a lot of open tables and 6 people at bar side. Cool. so upon arriving, walked in found them sitting. Waitress was kind but scarce. Live guitarist singer, atmosphere was low key. After a bit of conversation there was that \" wheres the waitress?\" moment. I will say that everyone had had their drink orders already placed. When she eventually arrived things got off to ordering appetizers. We progressed into dinner orders.  Wings, Shrimp and Grits, Brisket and sides.  Cut to the chase.... wings were spiced yet pink inside. Brisket, flat in taste and bit dry. Shrimp and grits; let me say that I have had my share of  shrimp and grits. This was my prime objective for this visit, to find a place that rocks shrimp and grits. For consideration that this is new and off the ground running attempts to open doors in a culturally expansive community, lets just say improvement is required here to sell this as a part of their menu. If you are without taste buds you may find these okay. People that have grown with or traveled elsewhere you may find this on the bland side. Combining grits, shrimp and slices of sausage makes not shrimp and grits. Soul is required.  In my attempt to liken this place and just to see for myself, I took to go the untouched wings that my brother didn't want. I think he had 2 from actual order. Next day, noon-ish, I used my toaster oven and these wings for 8 mins. welp!! Brother was spot on, outside spicy as all get out and flavorless underneath. I tried! Back to Oregano's, Chili's and Native."}
{"text":"Fantastic barbeque!  Pulled pork sandwich is outstanding and best wings in town!  Good vibe - casual and has a nice patio too."}
{"text":"We went to the sneak peek event. We got to try a wide array of menu items. The restaurant itself is super cute. The Brussels sprouts were to die for!!! If you love B. Sprouts you need to try them. The baked chicken wings, deviled eggs, and brisket were also delicious. The only thing I don't recommend is the ribs - they were so tough you could barely cut through it with a fork and knife. I was worried this restaurant was going to be super unhealthy and all deep fried southern food, but I was pleasantly surprised. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I went there while I phoenix , really good food. I am on Keto and they made everything for me, really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"A swing and a miss.  They put themselves out as southern food, but really all.it is is barbecue and poor barbecue at that. The one exception is that the deviled eggs are pretty good. Not so food that they are worth the trip.  To make matters worse we had the most terrible service I have had since I can remember.    The only question here is how soon they will close."}
{"text":"Awesome new place for BBQ & beer & wine. 100% on point. Looking forward to going back. We loved the high top tables in the bar."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and their cocktails are amazing! You can custom make them to your liking and they definitely are not weak. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, try the fried chicken it's ridiculously good! The bar staff are amazing, they've made me a regular. If you're unsure on which bourbon, rye, or whiskey to try, the bar will set you straight for sure! If I could give 6 stars I would! You MUST try the wings dry with the sauces on the side, so good!!!"}
{"text":"We were totally happy with the brunch. I'm glad we gave this place a shot. $5 pitchers of mimosas- pick your flavor. All 4 in our party ordered the French toast with berry topping and liked it. They deserve your business."}
{"text":"Really can't recommend this place. The food was not good. No one at our table of five finished their meal. The beer was cold and the staff was friendly, so that saved this from being a one star rating."}
{"text":"Just a few things that could use some improvements. During business hours sweeping the whole patio while people are eating is a bit of a turn off as well as the loud juicer constantly running at the bar. Maybe do those things before you open. Ordered a mint julep and the cup was 3/4 full, rust on the rim of the metal cup, sent the drink back. And the cole slaw neither my husband or myself would eat because it was so bitter.  Now the good was the crab hush puppies.  Place is super large.  Waitress was the best."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Living in North Phoenix, I feel like we have to go into central Phoenix or scottsdale for a cool and hip restaurant! We went on the Sunday before Memorial Day and it was dead. I saw two other tables seated the whole time we were there. Couple ppl at the bar.  Anyway, we wanted a lower table for our party of six and felt like we were in Siberia. We were the last table closest to the bathroom. This is a beautiful place but it's huge. Felt very cut off.  Food-ordered the crab hush puppies. Good but need more crab. The remoulade was tasty-had a nice kick. I had the fried chicken sandwich. A little dry and I think their oil might be near its end. It didn't have that nice gold color fried chicken should have.  Pickles were delicious (and I don't normally like bread and butter pickles)  Mac and cheese-don't order. No flavor. Kraft mac is better.  I had sparkling wine so that was fine but the hubby and sister in law were not a fan of their mule and real housewife drink. Said the flavor was \"off\" and artificial.  Service-meh. Waitress was sweet but for how slow it was she could've stepped it up. One shouldn't run out of iced teas or waters. Our bill was almost 100 bucks. Not worth it. I don't see this place lasting very long which is sad because it's beautiful and they have some great ideas!"}
{"text":"This was our second time here. First time when right then they opened and it was not great- out of a lot and the fried chicken and fries were nothing but grease. Awful stomachache . We decided to give it another shot this evening. Service was good but again, not impressed. The shrimp poor boy was more bread then anything, 6 small shrimp sat inside the massive roll. The fish and chips were more chips then anything, there were two small pieces of fish and 2 hush puppies. I wish they would've done way less chips at more fish. We also got a side of the crispy Brussels sprouts , they were chard but they were soaked in so much that they weren't even crispy. Overall, I think this place has so much potential but I have not been impressed. It needs work, plain and simple."}
{"text":"We arrived around 6:30 PM on Friday (yesterday) there was a couple people at the long bar and maybe 6 to 8 tables sat. They (hostess) immediately told us it would be a 20 minute wait. We all looked at each other (party of 4) and said something to the hostess and she said they don't want to sit anymore tables because the kitchen was backed up. We said OK. A couple of us went to the restroom and on our way back we got paged so we that sat in about five minutes, not 20. Again there might have been 30 people in the restaurant that probably sat 100 people. The restaurant was extremely beautiful and very nicely laid out I understand it was Toby Keith's restaurant but went out of business and they eventually took over. Two of us ordered sandwiches (beef), one ordered the shrimp and grits and the other order a platter of shredded pork with grits on the side. Needless to say all four of us had to send our food back. Our meat with in our sandwiches were big chunks beef and lots of gristle/fat - the meat was barely warmed. The shrimp and  grits were not creamy and rich they were actually very under cooked and very grainy. Horrible!  Whatever sauce was mixed with the micro shrimp that they put in the shrimp and grits was also horrible. The meat platter had dry meat on it.  Lead us all to believe that all the meat came out of prepackaged bags and partially warmed or not!  Very sad and very disappointing!  The waitress was exceptional. They did end up taking our meals off of our bill....we were all surprised that a manager did not come over to talk to us. Chicken shit in my opinion. We did have some beer and wine which was fine as well as 2 appetizers. The hush puppies as well as the sample platter.  Both were pretty good! Thanks"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends 27MAR18.  First timers and was impressed by the ambiance.  Very clean and welcoming.  For appetizers, had the Picked Relish Tray and the Wings.  wings were tender, delicious and ordered a second helping.  The sauces were very tasty and kept me coming back for more.  For dinner we ordered a ton!  Hot Link, Fried Chicken and Ribs.  Sides galore, Greens, mashed Potatoes, Brussels Sprouts, Biscuit, Corn Bread, Cole Slaw and of course drinks.  Now the review......Wings, Fired Chicken, Greens, Sprouts, Biscuit all excellent.  Coleslaw dry and vinegary so if you like real southern slaw stay away.  Ribs horrible (very tough).  In fact, so tough we complained and asked they be taken off the bill.  Wait staff slow and it was empty there.  Our bad, we didn't check to see if they removed the ribs, they didn't!  All in all we would go back for certain items and steer clear of some.  Will be pricey, for both cocktails and food, so if price for some decent food isn't a concern, then try them out."}
{"text":"We literally just got home and I couldn't wait to write a review. Save your money and the calories. My husband is from the South and it was nothing like the South. I'm not from the South and it was just flat out not good!!! We ordered deviled eggs without the trout. $8.50 for 4 deviled eggs (literally 2 whole eggs)!!! They were ehh. Not impressed but not terrible, but definitely over priced given the portion. Next came fried okra which I was super excited about. Terrible. You get a tray of tempura with maybe a total of 3 okras chopped in there. Don't remember the price but again overpriced. Next was dinner. I ordered the ribs and my husband had the sampler for one. My ribs were either not fresh or just completely over cooked and charred. They were so dry!!! And the BBQ sauce they give you had absolutely no flavor. It was like watered down cafeteria sauce. My husband's sampler also wasn't the best and let's just say as I write this review he's in the restroom.  For sides we got coleslaw, mac n cheese, beer batterer fries and the biscuit. Coleslaw was way too vinegary. Couldn't eat it. Mac n cheese wasn't bad but needed some salt (and I'm not even a salt person). Biscuit was not fresh. Hard and dry. And the beer battered fries... you basically bite into nothing but greasy fried dough. No potato. Our dinner was $110 including tip and we left more than half of the food on the table. I know they just opened so hopefully they can improve but we have no intentions of going back."}
{"text":"High & Rye is a Southern Style American Restaurant located on High Street by Dessert Ridge Mall. When you walk in you pass a cheerful looking patio. The room starts out looking like a shotgun style. It starts off as long and narrow. You see a very long bar with lots of bottles of booze. I presume they got all kinds of rye and whiskies. On the other side of the bar are high top tables. Then we walked past a musician and sat in a very large open dining room with another bar or two.  We ordered and received our meals in a little over twenty minutes.  I tried the Smoked Trout Spinach Salad.This salad isn't getting any awards from anyone anywhere if they prepare it the way they did for me.  I thought my salad had a few problems. My plate contained a good sized pile of fresh spinach. However.......My smoked trout salad only contained TRACE amounts of smoked trout. I don't think I got even one ounce of trout. I had to \"FISH\" for trout. I got to taste a few morsels that I think were good but it was hard to tell since the salad contained such a small amount of trout. The other main problem with the salad was the apple. In a ($14.50) salad you expect some fresh crunchy apple. The apple in my salad was held in a solution and was limp and shaped like broken spaghetti. The first few pieces of limp wet spaghetti shaped apple I ate I didn't even recognize it as apple. As far as salads go this was a disappointing salad. I suggest to serve at least two ounces of smoked trout, shred or cut fresh apple and if you really want to make people happy a quick pickle to the the onion would be great!   Then we shared a small order of Jalapeño Corn Bread. I thought it looked good when they brought it out. Then I went to cut it so we could share it. It was SO DRY it just crumbled. I tasted it. The Jalapeño Corn Bread was also disappointing because it was so dry and needed more jalapeño. Either the recipe wasn't followed or they need a new recipe for corn bread. If they just add more jalapeño, egg and oil to the recipe the corn bread would be much better.  I must be honest and say the Shrimp & Grits faired better than the Smoked Trout Salad and the Jalapeño Corn Bread but wasn't perfect either. The Shrimp were prepared well and the plate contained a generous amount of shrimp. Grits were creamy but lumpy. The main problem here was the hand crafted hot link. The sausage was very dry and lacked heat. It wasn't like a hot link. The other problem was that this dish wasn't served hot and fresh. It came out of the kitchen just warm.  My review is only based on one visit. I found more misses than hits. At the time of this review this restaurant is newly opened and may or may not be still working things out.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Sat at the bar, Roman took very good care of us. The cocktails were delicious, as was the food. Pulled pork, ribs, baked beans and mac and cheese were wonderful, but my favorite thing was the collard greens. I haven't had any that good since I lived in Texas! In true southern style, sauces are served on the side for you to choose from. Great food, great service, will be back!"}
{"text":"There were 4 of us, everyone's food was great except 1 of us got brisket and it was extremely dry. The drink selection is great. Wine by the glass prices are a bit high. But we will def be back, good atmosphere & friendly staff. Will be back"}
{"text":"As I sit here enjoying opening day of a new eatery in the neighborhood I am reminded of what really matters....customer service and going the extra mile.  We ordered the Watermelon Salad and it's arrival happened after the entree.  For myself this was totally acceptable once it was explained they were without watermelon and had sent someone to buy!!  It would have been easier to just say we are out of the dish, but the perseverance to meet the customers expectation was the driver.  The dry rub smoked grilled wings were delicious as was the brisket.  I loved the build your own drink concept.  Overall a wonderful dining experience. Our server Zak was prompt with service."}
{"text":"Tried the pepper biscuits and was impressed. Will try the Jalapeno corn bread next time. The brisket was one of the most tender briskets I have eaten. I like spicy and the Tennessee BBQ sauce was spot on. Collard greens also just right. Service was great with lots of recommendations."}
{"text":"Fabulous surprise! Great vibe and the food-off the charts. Southern food in the desert. Blue crab hush puppies were to die for. It'll be hard-but save room for dessert-open face apple pie all made in house. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent southern fare. We liked the grits and shrimp. The Risotto had good flavor too. Overall a nice neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Love the food, atmosphere, and the staff was super friendly. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We had a lovely time here! Ended our date night with drinks and apps and absolutely loved that there is such a great place on high street to hang out and enjoy great conversation. We loved the blue crab hush puppies, jalapeño corn bread. The old fashion as ordered on the menu was great. Would def recommend this restaurant and we are looking forward to coming back. The live music on Saturday night was great!"}
{"text":"Had the best experience here! The food was absolutely delicious and the wait staff was very friendly. We went on a night with live music and she was so great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night before a comedy show.  We had drinks and a fried chicken sandwich (to split, for a snack).  We sat at the bar.   Our server/bartender was pleasant and friendly.  We had Moscow mules to drink and they were good.   A large place that was not super busy for a Saturday evening around 6:30.  We enjoyed the fried chicken sandwich...but I thought it was a bit on the dry side...lacking either tomatoes or pickles something..we did enjoy the chips that were served with the sandwich...they were very good!  Lots of parking nearby.  Clean bathrooms:)"}
{"text":"Location: High Street, Desert Ridge (5 Stars)  Food: Southern Shrimp and Grits are way to buttery and full of cooked onion.  Wings were fatty.  Hush puppy's were good. (3 Stars)  Service: Mixed here. The young lady behind the bar was great.  The guy behind the bar reminded my wife of Jersey Shores. (she earned 5, the dude earned 2)  We probably won't be back unless with a large group."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Drinks were cool...could have used more unique drink options or a full list of alcohol options (bourbon, whiskey list). However we really liked what we ordered. Loved the \"make your own\" menu for manhattans, martinis, or old fashions.  Great idea!!  Menu was amazing. Upscale southern. Had the crab hushpuppies (delish), and the shrimp & grits (tasty, perfect consistency).  Wouldn't have changed anything.  Ryan was our server and was super friendly, made suggestions, checked on us every few minutes, and gave us the history of the place. Live music on Fri & Sat nights.  Atmosphere, ambience, decor were all top notch. Nailed it with their theme.  Loved our experience....will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I visited High & Rye for the first time today.  The food was great.  I also received first class service from Robert Gregg, General Manager, Robert, Bar Manager and Rachel, Bartender.   I highly recommend visiting High & Rye."}
{"text":"Big place with an interesting seating arrangement.  They are a bourbon bar that allows you to choose from a selection of bourbons and rye for your Manhattan or Old Fashioned.  They have a fairly good selection of beers on taps as well.    Got there at a few minutes to 3 which is when happy hour starts.  Asked the server if we should wait to order and she said no problem she would start happy hour for us right then.  Turns out they didn't and charged us extra for the drinks.  I ordered a Manhattan and while the server was walking the long way from the bar to the table, she spilled a bunch of the drink on her hand.  I said no problem but she said \"let me get you a new one\".  She walked all the way back and the bartender said serve it to him anyway it's full enough.    The food is southern style with bar type fare.  Tried a few apps but didn't stay long after the spilled Manhattan was served."}
{"text":"I just ordered the Brussels sprouts, brisket, and Chicken. It was great. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is strictly for drinking, in order to enjoy the food you must be intoxicated, friendly staff though, but the food sucks"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and attentive staff, especially to our three young children. Fried chicken, watermelon salad, Texas hotlinks are of particular note."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars. Fuck the rude staff and the shitty food. The food is too salty. I talked to an employee and the don't pay well and didn't give him his last pay check. I would never work for this restaurant or eat there. The manager sucks and is horrible to his staff. I would NEVER recommend this play to ANYONE. WONT SUPPORT A RESTAURANT THAT DOESN'T TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEE'S WELL."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  Tried it out on a whim and were more than pleasantly surprised.  The smokey meats were spectacular and the side dishes were splendid!  No boring side dishes here!  I highly recommend the Mac N Cheese and the Burnt End Baked Beans for sides.  We also enjoyed the Deviled Eggs.  Everyone at the table ordered something different and all of it was fabulous!  Best whiskey and beer selection I've seen in a while too.  Service was the best we have had, with a very knowledgeable and entertaining waiter named Cesar.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As regulars on High Street we were excited to see a new business open up. We stopped in the weekend they opened so hoping to chalk our experience up to bad timing. We had one appetizer, the blue crab hush puppies. Basically a giant ball of cornbread with maybe if your lucky a piece of crab in the middle. This coming from someone who loves hush puppies!  We dipped them in each of the barbecue sauces and I agree with another reviewer, tasteless and watery.  We also ordered a cocktail from the menu. I had a martini and it was great. My husband ordered a traditional Old Fashioned. The bar tender did not know how to make it and she had to keep looking at the recipe. He received his drink a good 5 minutes after I received mine. Another bartender actually came up and asked if he wanted anything!    My last comment would be the atmosphere.   We sat up at the very long bar. It was super bright and felt more like a breakfast counter than a bar. The cash registers are all on the bar and feel very much in the way when you are trying to choose a seat. Who wants to share your counter space or look at a cash register. It just didn't have a good vibe. The space is too big. I wish the owners luck and hope things turn around and they are not cursed with the failure of the other businesses before them."}
{"text":"Went to check out this cool food gem after Yelp notified me (thanks Yelp). I've been twice now because those Nashville got wings are amazing! Cornbread is also delicious (don't mind that it says jalapeño cornbread) because you can barely taste it. Drinks are good and strong (bartenders there have a strong pouring hand). Ambience is cool too. Only con are annoying gnats or fruit flies that hover over your food (even if you're seated indoors). It's close to my house so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow for an almost empty restaurant. Drinks were left to go empty & when asked for another beer, the waitress never brought it. The food wasn't that good. Pulled pork was very dry. Chicken wings were so so. The one good thing was the fried chicken sandwich my husband ordered. As long as you left off the bread & butter pickles & the chow chow which was another sweet vegetable mixture that wasn't very good. With the higher prices, slow service, & mediocre food unlikely we will try it again."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! I would give it 6 stars if I could! Awesome food and friendly staff- our bartender Rachel was awesome, and served us up some kick ass pitchers of mimosas that got the party started!! Definitely will be making High and Rye my new go to brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Truthfully, this is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.... we went with a large group on a Saturday, the place was mostly empty with the exception of the bar top. The extensive cocktail list - a positive - had a few delicious sounding drinks but ordering the same drink twice resulted in two absolutely different tasting drinks. Sending the second back resulted in a third totally different taste. Unfortunately another at our table had a similar experience. The food was just horrible. We ordered the brisket which was dry and flavorless and made it a meal with the brussel sprouts - the cost of which was almost $20. The best part of the meal was a side, the pickles. They do have some good sauces which is another positive. The brussel sprouts were oversauced and while being sold as crispy were instead soggy. The service certainly didn't help anything. Our girl was poorly equipped to handle a group of 12 and while very pleasant, seemed frazzle and unsure with each step. The manager - I assume - stopped at the table once and asked if we needed anything, we did not and with that she was gone. Another at our table mentioned the fries were good but no one will be in any rush to return. Really just shockingly bad all around."}
{"text":"Excellent ribs, brisket, and pork shoulder.  Many sides to choose from. Very delicious. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Well, the review in the local paper got us here.  The restaurant is large with a nice patio area.  We sat on the benches behind the bar.  Unless you are 7 feet tall,  you need a foot rest.  Easy to add.  We ordered fried chicken, corned bread, grits and greens.  We had visions of the buttermilk brined chicken being flavorful and juicy- NOT!  After the crust, there was no flavor. We both added a lot of salt.  The greens were interesting.  I never figured out what the spice was but they had flavor.  BUT, how tough is a collard green that you cannot cut it with a knife and fork?  Anyone from the south knows a cardinal culinary sin is to serve grits or cornbread cold!  We had both, sent them back, waited 5-7 minutes for \"hot\", and they were not.  We gave up, had the server box up the grits and threw them away on the way back to the car. This place is in a great location, and could be a gem. I hope the owner is not using this as an investment. If this place is your passion, you need to be on the floor."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and bar, friendly staff but $6.50-$7 for a 12 oz beer is ridiculous. We planned on staying for a few drinks but ended up having one and going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Talk about an unexpected hidden gem. This space has been given new life and has kicked out its previous Cowboy Saloon and Toby Keith's roots and emerged as this bright, inviting space with clean line and plenty of smiles.   We had four in our party and decided our best course of action was to go family style. This is how it all went down. Fried Chicken, crispy but lacking moisture and flavor. The black pepper biscuits were surprisingly hard and again lacking a deeper dimension of flavor. Crispy Brussels slight crunch and great level of acidity. The brisket( fork tender), Jalapeño cornbread, great level of moisture and season but lacking any trace of heat. The burnt end baked beans, seemed to have too much vinegar and the sauce cried out to be reduced further. Crusted French fries were I feel completely the star of the show, reminiscent of this gas station hot box potato wedges, but this was the grown up version. Garlic roasted mashed potatoes, amazing flavor, fluffy, no additional seasoning needed. The star of the night by far was the Peach Cobbler. The peaches perfect amount of sugar and spice and an amazing crispy biscuit crust.   Overall, we were pleasantly surprised and look forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"Excellent biscuits, very good bbq at a fair price. Service was good, would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The crab hush puppies were like WHOA.  Sauce was on point too. I had the fried chicken sandwich which was very flavorful, really good bun, and the beer battered french fries with ranch. the ranch dressing was out of this world. heavy on the dill and chives just how I like it.  my husband had the sampler plate with 3 meats and he loved it.  they give you lots of sauces to choose from at the table like nashville hot sauce, a hot mustard sauce, etc. service was great, prices are reasonable, good ambiance.  we will be back fo sho."}
{"text":"The one star is for the nice bartender that took my to-go order! Very friendly and engaging while waiting for our 80$ worth of food. Unfortunately once we were home we realized the food was not as pleasant. None of the food was very good but the watermelon salad and fried Okra were by far most disappointing! I did call back to let them know I was underwhelmed with the amount of watermelon salad for $14 and the manager literally could have cared less and told me watermelon was very expensive right now... Upsetting because we live in desert ridge and are always looking for new places to try. Not even close to being worth it"}
{"text":"They try to be creative and sometimes it works, but overall the food is average. The outstanding beerbattered fries and good crab hush puppies were offset by the overcooked fried chicken and the cilantro in the Brussels sprouts. The service was pleasant and the ambiance too. But I wouldn't hurry back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant. Usually I love the appetizers and feel Meh about the dinner but this time I felt the exact opposite. We started with the crab hush puppies and fried okra- both were good but not great. My daughter got the large order of fried chicken with the intention of bringing some home but alas all was eaten. My husband and I shared the sampler (says it's for one - there's no way one person can eat all that food!) and it was delicious. All of our food & sides were amazing. We also had apple pie at the end which was to die for (like a flakey almond danish with apples and ice cream). We have already texts our friends telling them how wonderful this restaurant is. We are big fans of BBQ and fried chicken and there isn't a restaurant on this side of town that can compete."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Okay, we went back. And, I'm glad we did! High & Rye has too much promise and a well crafted menu. It deserved another chance. This time 4-stars, well earned.   We ate at the bar again, with our superstar bartender Shannon (got the name right this time). She remembered us and greeted us warmly. Started out with great drinks; Lock Stock & Barrel rye for me, The Real Housewife cocktail for the wife.  for both and the service!  We started with the Blue Crab Hushpuppies. Very good. Crispy outside, fluffy inside and full of flavor. Thumbs up .   We opted for the Meat Sampler. Shredded smoked pork shoulder, smoked beef brisket and a Texas hot link. All prepared nicely. The stand-out was the brisket. I'm a hard judge on brisket and this was really good. The pork unfortunately was luke-warm then turned cold and the hot link wasn't that hot but flavorful. For sides we had the Carolina Gold Hoppin John () Southern Collard Greens () and Red Skin Garlic Mashed Potatoes (). Overall, the meal was good and will make us go back.   We'd hoped for a good experience, because we really wanted a reason to continue to eat here. We got it. The service and attention were spot on and, Shannon the bartender made our visit just that much better. She gets  hands down!  After this 2nd experience, I am changing my opinion to one of \"Recommend\". Go try High & Rye!"}
{"text":"I am so excited for all of the new places opening in Desert Ridge. High & Rye has a southern style farmhouse decor vibe going on. We ordered the dry rubbed wings, and it came with some amazing blue cheese dip. The wings were crispy on the outside and the meat wasn't dry. Then, I ordered the Nashville fried chicken sandwich because this girl loves her Nashville cayenne sauce. Everything about this sandwich was perfect. The serving of chicken was massive. The sauce was tangy and peppery just how it should be. I didn't love the pickles on the side, but I didn't go there for the pickles. Also, the grandma's coleslaw is actually how grandma makes it in my family. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Greasy, very mediocre food and the most inattentive service I've had in a long time. Place was empty on a Friday night. That should have been our first clue. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Desert Ridge area. There's no other place in AZ with such good Southern food."}
{"text":"My love for fried chicken led me here. They took over a large space - too large to feel comfy- but the patio is more intimate so we sat there.  Our server approached us right away and we ordered drinks. It wasn't that busy so service was pretty quick. We started with the deviled eggs. Despite the poor presentation they had a delicious taste. Their fried chicken prices are not too bad. We shared 8 pieces for $18 and had lots to bring home. The batter is lighter than most places, which was impressive and the taste was divine. We also ordered beans, Brussels sprouts and collard greens for the sides- all were flavorful. I hope this place hangs on- High Street can be a tough location, but with these prices and good food it has a chance."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be called High and Dry! I can't see them staying open much longer. Beautiful large restaurant with terrible food! All four in our party sent our entrees back. Some food was cold, meat was grisly/fat, shrimp and grits just were horrible. Grits were not smooth and the sauce was overpowering with spice and not edible!!! Our waitress was great. A manager should have come to the table and never did. Needless to say we won't be back."}
