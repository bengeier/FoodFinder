{"text":"Food is good and always enjoyable, but the custard is the key, with lots of favors and options.  Environment is great with more room than before and nice area outside for eating in nice weather.  Only issue is the service is a bit slow, but I can understand with the fresh made food and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"I had high hopes because I was a fan of the previous establishment in their location.  Cap Creamery didn't upset.  The quality of the food they serve is good and the cleanliness and service were also good.  For being a little burger joint / custard shop I think that they do a great job."}
{"text":"Salted Caramel Shake! Here they are good food too. Staff friendly. Won a free quart of custard though their Facebook. Picked Tutti Frutti. If you love Blue Moon then you will love this too."}
