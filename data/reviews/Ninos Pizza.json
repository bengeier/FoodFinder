{"text":"Great service and delicious food.  Delivery was appreciated.  The pizza is very good- they even have artichokes as a topping.  The entrees are also wonderful like the manicotti, Turkey devonshires and salmon croquettes.  Great to have a delivery option with entrees in addition to pizza.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this pizza for lunch and it's pretty good. I'm a pizza fanatic so it's hard to get a 5 out of 5 for me but this pizza has a pretty good taste and ingredient ratio. It's slightly greasy so if your not into that this may not be for you. There is a lot of crust too which particularly doesn't bother me. I could have however used a little more sauce but to each their own. I'd give this place a try for sure. It's a little on the higher end but it was quality pizza."}
{"text":"I just ordered the meatball Hoagie, it was honestly the best one I have had in my 44 years of life! The meatballs are truly homemade and the sauce was amazing with chunks of garlic all throughout the sauce. I just might have to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza, love the sauce, very cheesy and generous fresh toppings!! We will definitely be frequenting Nino's!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Monroeville and am so happy to discovery Nino's. So far we've tried white pizza, regular pizza, meatball hoagie, and fish sandwich. And cannoli (which is the best I've had since i used to eat at my Italian friends' houses with grandmothers who made their own). Everything has been outstanding, and we are pizza snobs (Mineo's and Aiello's really ruins you for all the crappy pizza that's out there). Make sure to order the cannoli, it really is outstanding."}
{"text":"Excited for another opportunity to eat this delicious pizza. We had a wonderful pie with mushroom and bacon. It was scrumptious! The shop is nice with a few places to sit and eat. Love the murals - will give the kids something to look at if you're waiting for your dinner. You're gonna need more pizza stools!  Looking forward to the summer when we can sit outside to enjoy a wonderful salmon salad with amazing homemade citrus dressing.  This pizza place brings great honor to the owners grandfather. He's proudly looking down on what a great accomplishment that you achieved. Kudos on a meal well made!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza we've had in the area. If you like Sicilian style I highly recommend it!"}
