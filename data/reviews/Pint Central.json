{"text":"Four stars all the way for food, service and beer selection. Enjoyed the chicken poppers (grilled chicken with mozzarella wrapped in bacon) and 2 orders of empanadas - beef & chicken. Discovered my new favorite winter seasonal on tap - Red Brick Divine Bovine. A milk stout with chai spices. Yes yes y'all. Look forward to trying more libations, as well as the avocado egg rolls"}
{"text":"Really an excellent place for a few drinks and an unusually diverse bar fair.  I enjoyed it very much.  Excellent experience !"}
{"text":"Second time here and have not been disappointed food wise. Have tried the avacado egg rolls, chicken wings, provaleta, chicken poppers, and herb fries. Never had a problem w the service either. They have a good selection of local beer and craft beer in general. The beers could be a little less pricey but that's the only thing I can think if right now."}
{"text":"This is a fun and delicious place to eat. I had the mahi mahi small plate, and the avocado fries. Wait staff was friendly and quick. Overall a good choice for a good lunch."}
{"text":"Wondrous atmosphere to get a quick bite to eat- especially when the weather is nice in the evening."}
{"text":"I love the mushroom sandwich and all their fries are amazing! Great beer selection, yummy Bloody Marys and cool atmosphere! Great for vegans and vegetarians and carnivores alike!"}
{"text":"Pint Central is a great new pub on central. As the name suggests they do have quite a good selection of beer, but not as extensive as World of Beer or Taco Mac. They also feature a great selection of wine and liquor. They make some dang tasty mixed drinks. Their Manhattans are among the best in Charlotte.

The food is very high quality for a pub. A decent menu no matter your dietary preference. Spicy eggplant dip might seem odd at first, but it is some really tasty stuff. Even though it may come off as a pub, it can also be a great place for dinner with friends/family.

There is plenty of seating, both at the bar, inside booth and tables, and outside. They have a front and a back patio. Both are nice. In the front you can see Central Ave. and the cars and people go back. The back patio is fenced in, so you get some more privacy there.

Last I'll mention that the staff and management are very nice people and you can tell they care about their work. I definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, nice wait staff and awesome bottle/draft selection. Will definitely be back again. The food smells amazing although I have not tried it...yet"}
{"text":"This place is not good AT ALL!!!  The seating is not comfortable. If you want a chair with a back you have to sit at the bar. Took our food over an hour. The waitress said there was a mix up in the kitchen! The place isn't that big anyway! Not many people there so what was the problem?!?!?  Food had no seasoning. Asked for mayonnaise. Never got it. Potatoes overcooked. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"The Avocado Salad is spectacular.

The bacon-wrapped chicken thingies are good but you only get four tiny little morsels for 9 bucks?

Out of a billion to choose from, there are only IPAs or fruity specialty beers.  There is no real variety.  They are on the pricey side too.

The bartenders are douchey."}
{"text":"Come to the bar for amazing service with Mary, Henry & Josh. Great apps, an excellent beer selection & very cool (potent) masterful cocktails."}
{"text":"Great draft list, good specials, kind people. The ambience is comfortable. I feel as if I could drink all day here. Adorned with local art  and local drafts, Pint Central easily represents the \"home-grown\" aesthetic. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"I love living in the central area of town! We have some great places to chose from no doubt. However, they all tend to be the same'ole type of bar food or if its a step up its way more expensive ... So this place has it ALL- atmosphere, great drink selection, great service, AMAZING food and super reasonably priced! You can try a couple of tapas get a couple of drinks and an entree and not break the bank... this place will be a neighborhood favorite for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe and great beers on tap.  There is a large selection of tapas to choose from and the cauliflower bites are a must!"}
{"text":"Cool place with decent beer prices and cool people! I didn't order any food but it smelled good."}
{"text":"Great spot!  We sat on the back patio, and even though some dbag was smoking a cigar (seriously, that should be illegal) we had a great meal and a great time.  The small plates were fantastic - avocado fries being a highlight for us.  Some bits were better than others, but everything was tasty.  Excellent addition to Plaza Midwood and hopefully can pick up some of the slack as Soul has been inconsistent lately."}
{"text":"Pros: location, beer selection and crowd
Cons: bar service, beer selection

Pint is located on the edge of plaza midwood and Elizabeth, across from the Thirsty Beaver on Central Ave and Lamar. The location is stellar for bar hopping and walking around the neighborhood. 
They have a decent beer list, draft and bottle, but at a place that calls itself Pint, you should have at least 20 beers on tap. Pint comes in around 10. Granted, most of those beers are good selections (la fin du monde!) but in Plaza Midwood you have to offer more. Being the bar with the fewest selections on draft isn't a prize you want to claim. 
The bar itself is comfortable and accommodating, but it needs to be because the bartenders are neither of those things. Service is painfully slow, even on quieter nights. The bartenders here don't seem to understand multi-tasking and none of them have a quick draw. I sat toward the end of the bar on my last visit and was passed by many times before anyone made eye contact or asked me if I wanted a drink. Yes, I wanted a drink. That's why I was glaring at you with money in my hand as you washed glasses and straightened up behind the bar. I have visited pint about 5 times now and have never once had great service at the bar. 
Pint does also offer tables with service, but the menu is filled with fried tapas, and not a single plated meal. 
The interior is drab with random bar signs posted is no particular fashion. The walls and ceiling make you feel like you're sitting in your buddies garage. This could definitely be warmed up with some color to match this colorful neighborhood. 
Overall, pint gets 3 stars but 2 of those are for the location and price."}
{"text":"2 STARS


1 star for the beer selection. All though unorganized and overprice had a decent selection
1 star for the pretty tasty sandwich and great sweet potato fries. 

The service was horrible. Me and my friend sat at the bar 2/26 and we literally almost walked out in the first 5 mins because our server was such a bummer. Dead eyes. No sorta awareness of social cues. Blank face. 
I asked for ketchup and he just starred at me. He wasn't mad, happy or anything. No emotion. Yes I got the ketchup but I mean come on. We did not feel welcomed at all. 

Highly doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Great food and beer selection! Enjoy the selection of vegetarian options including the Avocado fries and the Beet/Goat cheese sandwich. Love the back patio when it's warm, too!"}
{"text":"Standard bar food. Nothing extraordinary. I had the mushroom burger and a local NoDa brew. The burger was VERY filling. It could probably be shared by a couple of people. The World Cup games were on so it made for a sporty atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is great! Friendly staff, great beer selection, and amazing food. Carlos and Mario the owners are really cool guys and take care of their customers. They do it right at Pint Central!"}
{"text":"Great small plates of food and awesome beer selection.  Mario the owner is really into having a wide selection of bottles and taps available.  Pet friendly and 2 sections for outside seating.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Lol. Out of oranges at 9:26pm? Who does the inventory? Smells horrible and service is silly."}
{"text":"Great beer selection... Rotating tap list from great breweries. The food is excellent. The choripan was just the right size and seasoned just right"}
{"text":"I have been here several times before and love the food and place however my last experience has left me disappointed. Not only were people smoking almost inside the restaurant but i ordered  food that never came as well. I hope I will one day want to return here but sadly the service and stench of cigarettes smell I probably won't."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to try a new place.  From the beginning the service was poor (See further: waiting at the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign for 5+ minutes).  My major gripes were these: I had a food allergy, and ordered something specifically marketed as being allergen free, was brought the wrong food and therefore something with allergens in it, and was charged for things that were offered to me seemingly at no cost.  I got tacos (Note: Tofu taco is NOT gluten free; I reached out to restaurant to see if the beef taco was because I got sick after eating there and suspect it isn't, but they did not ever contact me back) because the waitress told me it was what they were known for.  Not worth it.  2 stars because my margarita was cheap ($5 special on Mondays) and tasty, although again, not life altering."}
{"text":"When I went to Pint Central I went for the food not the drinks... that might be why I was less than impressed. At the expense of sounding terribly old and cranky, my first impression was the place was too loud. I ordered the Choripan and the lamb lollipops but neither left me breathless or even semi satisfied. I think there are enough things on the menu that deserve a second look so I think there will be a follow up coming soon :)"}
{"text":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen, unfortunately.

I use to go to Pint Central a lot....  multiple times a week - sometimes for lunch (by myself or with a friend) and for dinner with my wife.  The service used to be excellent, as was the food - both the sammichs and the small plates.

A year or more ago the food was fantastic - all of it, and the service was friendly.  I can remember ordering a caesar at lunch and adding shrimp - the bartender would ask if I wanted the shrimp blackened or not....  when the salad came out, it was once of the best caesars I've ever had - with six big, beautiful shrimp on top.

When I was there a month ago, that same caesar came out and it was a different story - it wasn't fresh, the shrimp were TINY, and to be honest, I've had better salads at Hooters....   and Hooters is not exactly known for their salads.  :)

I don't know what happened....  but this place went from being awesome to basically sucking.  I hope they figure it out and can return it to its former glory."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. Great bartenders, shoutout to Tyler and Chris. And as far as bar food goes, this place is excels. The breakfast burger is great. The wings are juicy, crispy and saucy. Thumbs up across the board."}
{"text":"Solid place - $1 PBRs, big draft menu, cornhole outside, nice atmosphere. The avocado fries and Brussels sprouts were both good. Bartenders were cool even when we spilled a drink and mostly ordered PBRs."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places.  We just went last night, around 6pm.  It wasn't crowded at all so we were able to sit on the back patio.  Great service and lots of beers on tap.  Breakfast burger is AMAZING.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Was not incredibly impressed with this place. But there were a couple of highlights including the beef tidbits (very well-cooked and seasoned) and the mini burgers which was surprising. I think what drove the mini burgers home was whatever onion-type sauce they are topped with.

Otherwise, based on the other items we ordered (don't get the wings), to me it simply seemed this place was trying a little too hard to be \"trendy\" and \"hip\" both with their menu and atmosphere. The beer selection wasn't terrible at all but for a place with \"pint\" in the name, I was expecting a bit more.

Atmosphere-wise, I think I was again turned off by the place trying way too hard to be trendy and modern. For some reason it just didn't fit what I was expecting.

I'm not sure I'll try this place again since I feel we got most of what was good on the menu with limited satisfaction. Certainly the mini burgers might be worth a trip however. We'll see."}
{"text":"Maybe this was an off day but it was arguably one of the worse places I've gone to. I will agree that we had 11 people in our party, but the place was completely empty when we got there. Even when we left, there were only 3 other tables of 4 people or less. 

It all starts with the drinks taking about 10 mins to come out after we ordered. Then our plates started coming out(25 mins later) very staggered. My friend's and mine's sides came out 15 minutes before everyone else's meal. Once our food came out, it seemed the chef had overlooked a second order of wings so one person had to wait an extra 10mins. I understand that food lateness is not the server's fault, however; she never went out of her way to ensure us that the food was coming or that they were running behind. She would only let us know when we would get tired of waiting and would go ask at the bar. 

The seasonal veggies were awesome, but the Cauliflower Bites were pretty atrocious. It seemed they were sitting in oil for too long, or the oil wasn't hot enough because some parts were so saturated with oil(yes, I know they were battered and fried) that I felt that I was applying a layer of chapstick. They would be better suited to just fry seasoned cauliflower pieces and toss them in a sauce like Fern and Bean does. 

I do give credit where credit is due. My gross cauliflower was taken off the bill as well as fixing a price error on another person's check."}
{"text":"Beer was ok, but the food was terrible. Salmon was extremely salty, the waitress was polite enough to remove from the bill. But pointed out that's how it is prepared so even if you get the next one it will be bad. The other appetizer were also not great."}
{"text":"The Choripan...fuck yes to this! Delicious. Service was great, even though establishment was packed. I will definitely come back. Kitchen runs until midnight and taps run until 2am."}
{"text":"Came in for the trivia night, but I got the fries and avocado fries as well. The garlic parm fries were delicious with the dill ranch with it. And unfortunately the avocado fries had wax paper with it so we sent those back. But even with the wax paper it was really good food for what you got. But shout out to our server Miranda she was fantastic."}
{"text":"Just ok, nice outside seating area. The set-up is good, the place is clean and seems to be a nice meeting place for locals. I didn't eat I was only drinking so I cannot comment on the food but the drinks are pricey. Be prepared to pay more due to the location and not expect any drink specials. $3.75 domestic bottles, $5.25 craft beer pints."}
{"text":"This is a very cool spot.  I'm not a big beer drinker so I opted for cocktails and was amazed by how great they were!  The food is not your typical bar food-it's delicious.  Love the argentine dishes.  I've been here 3 times and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I have had drinks here any times and have had at least 3 meals.  The place is laid out pretty cool - local art on walls, outside area for drinks and it always has a mixed of customer from college kids, business people to the hipsters. 
They have a nice selection of beer and I have always had top notch service.
The food - there are a few items on the menu the were non-memorable but the steak sandwich win roasted veggies was really good.  It's a good spot for casual drinks and good food.  I will continue to explore menu and get a cold brew here."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!

We came here expecting mediocre bar food, but it was late and we were hungry...they were open!! :) 

EVERYTHING we ate was delicious!  We got the avocado fries app.  They were great, but the sauce that came with them was spicy and soooo good, we had to save it to use on the herb fries.  

I got the portabello burger.  It was so yummy!  What a delicious combination!  I got it with sweet potato fries; they were sprinkled with sugar and came with a sweet dip.  John got the steak sandwich with the herb fries.  He loved his sandwich and liked his fries alright.  He was really loving that sauce that came with the avocado fries, so they gladly brought him some more.

Everything about this place was great and totally unexpected!  The ONLY thing negative to me, was it was just a tad too dark in there.  I know it was almost 9, but just a bit more light would have been great.  I have really good vision and it was a little hard to read things.  That was a very small thing though and didn't at all hurt our overall experience.

We will definitely be going here for our late night meals!!


UPDATE: 

We went back for more and had a fairly crummy experience.  The food was still great, but the atmosphere was lacking!  I'm hoping it was just a bad night.  A girl was in there screaming...blood-curdling-someone-is-trying-to-kill-me screams every few minutes at the bar.  How is this acceptable?  I mentioned it to my server, who seemed annoyed by it as well, but she was happy to make the excuse that it was her 21st.  I would have NEVER behaved like that somewhere public...much less at 8:45pm!!!!  Seriously?  I was appalled that they hadn't handled the situation better.  If I was the manager, I would have politely thanked her for coming to my establishment, but asked her to please not ruin the experience for our other guests and refrain from screaming.  If she did it again, I would ask her to leave.  Also, they probably should have cut her off if she couldn't keep it together!  Needless to say I was quite agitated.  We ate quickly and left as fast as possible. :-/"}
{"text":"Good food, not busy on a Sunday night. The staff was great and brought my old dog water and love. If you're looking for a pet friendly hang out with tasty food then this is the place."}
{"text":"Consistently great small plates and beer! I've been a few times and tried the lamb lollipop small plate, the turkey sandwich, both were savory and tasty. They have a good beer selection and nice staff."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here on a Wednesday night to check this place out.  Indoors is pretty big and the place was clean.  They have a back patio section which my favorite section of this place.  It's a smaller setting, there's amazing art work on the walls and dim hanging lights.  This is an awesome spot to chill in the fall when the weather is nice out.  The only gripe I have about this place is the customer service.  It was not that packed being a Wednesday but one of the bartenders (i'm assuming that he was a bartender because he was behind the bar) was talking to his friends the entire time.  I was hoping this guy was going to see that the I had not been attended to for quite some time by the original bartender that served me and would ask if I needed another beer or would check on me but it never happened.  I was going to try another beer but since it took so long to get served I just cashed out."}
{"text":"My first review was based only on Pint Central being closed during opening hours etc..I went back today and was really hoping to change what had been my lowest rated Yelp review...
Sadly, not today..We appeared to be the first customers at around 11:15(11:00 open) Right off the bat the waitress tells us that they \"are running a little behind setting up\"..No problem..we are 2 today, we order 1 app and 2 burgers..The app, Avocado fries comes out timely, slightly over fried(coating) but  tasty..So far so good..Again, we are the only party in the place.. at this point, the guy behind the bar rips a HUGE burp..Hey, cover your mouth!! LOL Waitress brings out burgers, immediately apologizes for the delay, stating,\"It's are new cooks first day\"!! I felt it wasn't that long so ensured her all was good..She then gave us 2 practically empty(literally)ketchup bottles stating, \"it's all I can find\"..So i dive into my fries, room temperature at best, small broken pieces of what should have been curly fries...My burger's (breakfast burger)egg cooked so well done , no runny yolk, burger way overcooked..Now if only I had a decent amount of ketchup to remedy this..My son's burger, (Korean burger) was alleged to come with \"Pork Belly\"..I don't know where they get their \"Pork Belly\" but the meat atop his burger was clearly a very thick slice of bacon!! Not bad albeit, but to advertise \"Pork Belly\" and give someone bacon??? And his side, a BLT salad listed \"topped with Avocado\"..What was indeed on the salad was a dollop of Ice Cold guacamole..Now to be clear, we did not say anything to the waitress at first(Hey, it was the \"new\" chef's first day) because we are were on a schedule, had a Groupon and despite the discrepancies with the burgers, they tasted fine(Korean better then the Breakfast) When the waitress came to take the Groupon(not asking if we wanted anything else etc) she asked how things were..I was hoping to just escape at that point but told her the fries were certainly underwhelming, not the right temperature and nothing but broken pieces ..She did ask if we would like a new batch but I declined, then she went on to say that it was the new cooks first day on his own and he was \"overwhelmed\" and he wasn't left with anything set up....1 app, 2 burgers? Not a single other customer in sight? What is going to happen at the height of their service today? She also stated the fries were made spiral in house and that them breaking into little pieces when they were fried was the norm..Hmmm..I then asked, is that really all the ketchup you have in the entire restaurant? \" She replied, \"I'm sorry , I can't find the key for the shed\" Enough said...But in the end, I did indeed leave her a tip for approx 16 % of the full bill before Groupon..My tip to Pint Central, Get your act together!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy had the beet sandwich w/ parm fries. They had good veggie and even vegan options which you never find at a beer joint! Will try the beers next time."}
{"text":"Although the service was good and I enjoyed the food, the bartender left a lot to be desired.
  I ordered a French 75- which he apparently did not know how to make or apparently want to make because i explained to the server it was only gin, simple syrup, lemon juice or sour mix and prosecco or champagne. Ingredients every bar has or should have. First of all the fact he couldnt be bothered to even Googe it was annoying and then I was told that the bar did not have the ingredients for the drink.
   Clearly this bartender just didnt want to make this very simple drink. I am a wine bar manager and when we get a drink order we are not familiar with, we look it up and make it if at all possible.
     This was a very negative experience and your bartender needs to be taught about cuatomer service.

{"text":"The breakfast burger is a dream come true. We only sat outside but loved the atmosphere. Came on a Sunday afternoon when it wasn't busy. Servers were excellent! Definitely looking forward to coming back. (Bonus:  outdoor area is pup-friendly)!"}
{"text":"This place is just fun to go drink at.  Soul is, admittedly, a better tapas place down the street.  But, they have solid food at Pint Central, too.

If you want a winning night - Food at Soul, drinks at Pint Central.

You're welcome."}
{"text":"Good food, great booze, and a chill vibe.  4 stars all the way, but I'll go ahead and bump them up to 5 for having Ballast Point's Sculpin on tap.

I'd assume more of a Flying Saucer or even a Salud with a name like Pint Central, but its more of a tapas bar with some good beers on tap.  

The food is great, lots of little bites of all sorts and sizes.  I've nibbled on all kinds of dishes, but the avocado fires seem to be the standout to me.  I can attest to other reviewers liking the avocado eggrolls and the brussel sprouts, too. I'm honestly not a fan of the Chimichurri Beef Tips, but after living with some Argentinians for a while, I'm pretty picky.  I need to hit up some sandwiches for lunch some time, all sound great and under $10.  As per the food though, I do like most of it and its not too pricey for the area, but there are at least 2-3 other places within stumbling distance that have pretty good tapas as well.  I don't know if there is enough room for everyone in Plaza Midwood.  I wish them all luck.

They don't have the largest tap selection in town by any means, but plenty of great options.  I always love my Sculpin, even though its no where close to local.  I love the fact that they have Higher Ground, Bird Song's Jalapeno pale, and NoDa's Hop Drop and Roll.  I've only had a couple, but great cocktails as well.  I'll hopefully report back on that real soon.

Oh yeah, I didn't really go over the layout, but you can get that from other reviews.  An FYI though, there is a chill area out back!

This isn't my first choice as per going out and grabbing some beers, as I can find cheaper booze close by.  It is a great place to get some good eats without a pretentious vibe."}
{"text":"When I go to a place called taps and the bartender suggests PBR something isn't right. The atmosphere is a little odd as well. The bartender was good and friendly as can be but the beer list was pretty garbage tbh. 

There were a couple of good beers. Quantity does not = Quality. The appetizers were really tasty though. 5-10 years ago their beer list would have been considered really good but at this stage in the beer game, if your name is Pint, you need to deliver with good beers. Went to go see the outside and was alerted that there was a private party going on. (Which happened to be the waitresses friends) Maybe a work event? Either way it wasn't a good experience. I'd be happy to consult with the beverage manger but it seems they are looking to push cheap locals and PBR. Doesn't really seem right with the name and all."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible. It took five minutes for anyone to notice we were waiting by the hostess stand. They aren't even busy. After we were seated, we waited another five for someone to acknowledge us. All the food arrived cold. The avocado fries somehow were overcooked and cold. The provoleta came out as one giant cold block. You are supposed to be able to dip crostinis into it. The bread pudding was nine dollars for a block that was ice cold in the middle. The caramel on top was pretty delicious though - I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Strolled on over after a few beers at the thirsty beaver across the street for a few cold ones. I love the beer menu and they have many fine selection of beers to chose from. My wife loves the not your fathers root beer. We didn't eat this time but the food did look delicious so next time for sure!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but if I lived in Charlotte, this would be on regular rotation. I had a solid burger - the breakfast burger - which some pretty delicious kale on the side, which is basically my perfect meal. And on a hot summer day, their Beet the Mule drink is The Best - delicious and refreshing. The only thing that could entice me to drink kombucha is booze, apparently."}
{"text":"I went to pint central a couple months ago. I ordered tacos and a sex on the beach. The bartender used tito's in my drink and charged me $12 FOR A SEX ON THE BEACH. The tacos were okay, the service was horrible. She barely paid any attention to us. I had to ask for everything. I'm a server. I know when a server is trying, and she was not. We won't go back"}
{"text":"Avocado rolls were hollow, tacos had no taste and Brussel sprouts needed salt. Service was super slow. Walk next store for better food and service."}
{"text":"Good addition to the neighborhood.  I like that I can walk here, get slammed off $4 Jameson and $2 PBR, then continue my journey to wherever the night takes me.  They have plenty of TV's for game watching and a very clean, refreshing atmosphere that seems even more so when you glance across the street at the Thirsty Beaver.  There's also a garage door they can open up towards the back that gives the end of the bar a great view of the Uptown skyline.

As far as the food goes, I'd give it a 3.5.  I've eaten here twice and mostly shared small plates.  It doesn't touch the quality of a few other restaurants in the hood, but I also didn't see a dish on the menu over $15.  My favorites were probably the mozzarella bites (not your traditional cheese sticks), avocado egg rolls, fried avocado, and chicken poppers (ask for ranch or blue cheese, blew my mind it wasn't served with a sauce).  As you can tell, we didn't get too far past the apps, but for the flavor and price point it was a good value.  The entrees were reasonably priced and looked good too.  Giving the entrees a try would provide a better gauge on the food as a whole, but I think this place is a solid 4."}
{"text":"The best Bread Pudding in town!! Loved the Chimichurri Beef tips appitizer. Hunter was the bartender and made us great specialty drinks because we could not decide what we wanted. Great service!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for beer. The actual building and patios are great, the beer selection is great, but there is one thing that really annoys me and cost them 2 stars from a would be perfect experience. More than half the drafts come in 11 oz glasses instead of pint glasses. I really despise sifter glasses unless I'm ordering a 7%+ beer or a special edition/rare beer. Could've been 5 stars, but that one hangup really bothered me. Pint central? More like 11oz central."}
{"text":"This is a bar trying to be more. The small plates were heavy and riffs on burgers and fries. The beer selection is what you would find at Harris Teeters and is marked up. Go to Gallery 22 if you want an amazing selection of beer, better prices, and a true tapas restaurant upstairs."}
{"text":"Lots of fun. Good crowd. 

The kale was delicious. Wasn't too impressed with the pork belly. Enjoyed the steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Really like this place! The food is delicious and has a different twist than what you would expect from somewhere called \"pint central\". I don't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine. The service is fine but not amazing or anything."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night bite. Got seated right away and ordered tacos and curly fries and a watermelon mule which was a special and really good. The food came out fast and was good. They were a little short handed but it wasn't that bad and the atmosphere was cool."}
{"text":"Very impressed from start to finish!! We live in the neighborhood & always like to support new businesses. Been anticipating this opening for a while now & it was worth the wait. Fast service, fabulous food, great hostess & server, gigantic draft & bottle beer menu, featuring several NC & even Charlotte brews...fabulous wine selection...w/ half price glass & bottle night on Monday. We even got to meet one of the owner/manager's at the end as we left & he thanked us for coming. I noticed 2 managers circulating while we were there, checking in w/ the front often. 

Went on a Friday @ 7, so obviously expected a wait since it was new & a wknd. Place was packed & hostess was super nice....went to the bar to wait & grab a drink. Didn't even have time to order before a table was ready for us, which was unexpected! Ordered several tapas: avocado fries, BBQ wings, avocado egg rolls & the pork belly. All excellent!! The pork belly is to die for. Husband got several different draughts (they were out of several, but there were plenty others to pick from), I got a few Malbec's. Server Anastasia was great & very fast...very attentive in a good way! We were shocked with how busy it was that our food came out so fast. 

Only complaint would have to be the noise level. Very loud in there & hard to hear anything, unless you're practically yelling. They actually had jazz playing , but it was barely heard. It was really crowded, but I guess that's a good sign for a new place! Several TV's with sports on. They have a big  patio out back w/ tables. I plan on being out there once the weather gets nice. 

Overall....5 stars! Love it & happy to have them in the 'hood now!!"}
{"text":"They have really really great food and a wide selection of beer and liquor. We always love going here."}
{"text":"Great service, good beer selection, and surprisingly good food for a bar.

I had the beef tenderloin tips. They were cooked to perfection and accompanied with chimichurri. Not to mention that it is right around the corner. The owners are of Argentinian descent and their selections on the menu put that on display. (empanadas, chimichurri, etc)"}
{"text":"Great food with craft beers. I've been to Pint Central twice and their food has never failed me. Amazing and well done put together that not only taste good but is beautiful! They have a variety of vegan and vegetarian food to offer as well. Their back patio gives you a nice relaxing vibe especially on a Sunday. They also offer a dog friendly environment on their patio. Make sure to bring your fur friend every Saturday for 10% off! Their service was quick and friendly. Our waiter was patient, provided a suitable service while letting us enjoy our evening without being the annoying waiter that ask us every min if we're doing okay. I recommend this place to friends and family if you're looking for some good food and a nice time."}
{"text":"We went to Pint Central for lunch Monday, 1/19. We had appetizers of Avocado Fries, Brussel Sprouts (that my mom who doesn't like Brussel Sprouts LOVED), and Provoleta (don't ask- just trust me on this one... you'll want to bathe in it by the second bite!), and Lamb Lollipops (that my sister who doesn't like lamb loved). Entrees were Mushroom Burger with rosemary potatoes, Beet Panini with sweet potato fries, and Chicken Sliders (goat cheese involved... mmmm). Dessert was bread pudding and coffee... Can you tell the food was good by the amount we ate!?!? Not a crumb left on any plate! Check out their menu: http://pint-central.com/

The environment was AWESOME!!!!  Great for ANYONE, ANY AGE, and ANY OCCASSION... family, date, friends, night out on the town.  

You will NOT regret going!!!!  It will most definitely be a fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"I just started working nearby, so I have been here a few times recently.  I have had the portobello burger, the beet burger and the Korean burger. My favorite is the beet burger, beet, arugula, goat cheese, crispy bun, PERFECT. Prices are good, service has always been excellent. Highly recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great beer and great food. A lot of friendly faces, and they're staying culturally relevant without even trying. What more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"Nothing worse then being given menus and the bartender just walks away with barely a hello as they were to busy with each other than taking an order. 

Waited ten minutes with no one ever gazing in my direction. I like casual but the hostess looked bored and put out. The bartenders seemed more interested in drinking the traps and chatting with each other than making any money. 

No real desire to go back and be bored myself waiting on a beer."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and by luck! We were headed to another midwood staple and decided to check out Pint! I'm so glad we did because I fell in love with the atmosphere and pleasant service. It was the owners birthday the night we went and it was kind of nice to have him come over and ask how everything was.  He stayed and talked for about 20 minutes and even made recommendations for next time we visit. The highlights: we ordered several tapas and I'm glad we did because we got a variety of flavors ranging from fried avocados, chimichurri, calamari, pesto brussel sprouts, empanadas, and the eggplant dip! Everything was great and I was impressed on fast the food arrived. By the time our drinks hit the table the food was up! 5 stars in my book. 
I can't forgot to mention the local beer selection both on tap n bottle. Plus it's pet friendly on the patio.  Great atmosphere and sure to be another midwood favorite!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the beer, but three stars for food and service. I'd come back here to drink, but not for the food. My wife and I stopped by around 2 P.M. on a Friday and the place was basically dead. We had the entire back deck to ourselves which was great for our dog. Beer selection was great, both cans and draft. It took a while for the server to get our food order. We ordered the brussel sprouts as an appetizer, and they seemed to be steamed instead of char-grilled with some parmesan. Not good. I had the Choripan sandwich which had good flavor but was super greasy. Yuca fries were ok. The wife had the breakfast burger which was decent. The hash brown (think McDonalds hash brown) didn't add much to the burger, and the egg on it was overcooked. Parmesan fries were ok. Pint Central essentially combines great ambiance and beer selection with mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"Had you guessed this is just another bar, guess again!  Pint Central also has outstanding food, among the very best in Charlotte.  Been here five times, and my most challenging task is choosing dinner from many great selections.  Brussel sprouts and garlic shrimp are incredible; cauliflower and park sliders also excellent.  Or choripan and a salad!   Everything is great, so don't skip the food!

My original yelp tip underestimated beer selections at Pint Central.  Not only were there 35 draft selections tonight, but twice that many in bottles and cans also.

Carlos always comes around and says \"Hello.\". Friendly touch.  Servers always remember me, are always welcoming, and very easy to talk with.

I suggest dumping the chain restaurants and giving your business to Pint Central instead."}
{"text":"Pint Central always delivers with great beer and a great menu of small plates and quirky entrees. On my most recent trip I had the breakfast burger, brussel sprouts, and avocado fries.  Avocado fries are a nice guilty pleasure (for those who don't now, they are battered and fried slices of avocado. 

The restaurant is kinda small and usually packed and parking is often difficult so you may need to park down by Metro 808 but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I gave Pint Central a try for the first time last week. I met a friend there for happy hour and was able to find a table with plenty of elbow room with no problem. I ordered a delicious appetizer, the Avocado Eggrolls, that were absolutely fab & was so full from them that I didn't need to order an entree. 

With a name like \"Pint Central\" I was expecting a pretty extensive local beer selection; I was sad that their list of local brews was pretty limited and hope they consider expanding the list in the not-too-distant future. 

Service was great, our server was really friendly and very attentive. My only complaint, aside from the limited local selections is the noise... the place was not crowded when I was in there, but because of the small size and the concrete floors, it was so loud I could barely have a conversation wth my friend. I'm not an acoustics expert, but there have to be some relatively inexpensive measures they can take to muffle the noise a bit so that people can comfortably carry on a conversation. 

All in all, great place... they're still pretty new, so I hope they get the few kinks  worked out. I will definitely be back and am excited to try more of their phenomenal food!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. The beer selection is robust. I ordered a meatball sub on this trip and it was good but the French fries were not fresh- you could tell they had been sitting there for a while."}
{"text":"This place really is  something 5 days ago we where there an after many attempts to to contact this place about the 4 year old boy who was bitten by a german shepard dog in their patio area  not one person from this place has contacted anyone from this family"}
{"text":"I dig this place!  We had dinner somewhere else then decided to check-out Pint Central for after dinner beers and dessert.  The churro dessert was delicious and not too filling (In other words, it didn't make me feel bad about myself).  The bartender was friendly and knowledgable.  We can't wait to go back for dinner and trivia!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  At night this place can have a dj and a little dance area with people hanging out. During the day it is more of a lunch spot.  Decent food and their beer selection is great and always rotating.  Though service can be very spotty here.  At night when it is busy it is usually on point.  During the day though it has been a different story.  On a couple occasions during the day our lunch has taken a ridiculously long time.  Both times there was barely anyone in there.  The last time our lunch took 2 hours.  2 beers, an app, and a burger took 2 hours.  30 minutes of drinking and eating and the rest just waiting.  Because of this I am unsure how I feel about this place"}
{"text":"I struggled between 3 and 4 stars here.  I LOVE the back patio and outside bar.  The owner, Carlos, was doing an AWESOME job building relationships with his customers.  He and his brother are from Argentina and opened the restaurant with his family just a week ago.  The menu is ambitious and has interesting flavors. The beer list is varied and local.  Our server, Antoinetta, was eager and friendly.

However, they were out of several beers.  Antoinetta could not describe some of the menu items well.  The food was uneven - the Choripan sandwich was amazing, but the pork belly was disappointing. 

I am confident that they will figure out their ordering, the servers will become better trained, and they will figure out how to make the menu better when they see what sells.

In the meantime, friendly service and a sweet vibe are enough to give this spot another chance.  Definitely check out the back patio."}
{"text":"Not your everyday bar food. Chicken Florentine was good but the turkey sandwich was really good. Loved the sweet potato fries with their homemade honey mustard. Kale & brussels sprouts are fabulous! Ryan, waistress, she is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place to try a bunch of small plates with a friend. They offer many beers on tap, lots of local beers are included. They did seem to be out of a lot of the beers when I visited."}
{"text":"Awesome service by Danielle and Mary! Someone complained about no oranges on here but didn't tell anyone who worked here...so because they truly care, within 10 minutes of the post they cut up oranges and gave some to every single table in the restaurant... awesome!"}
{"text":"What bar food should taste like. No frozen mozzarella sticks here. Try something you wouldn't normally order on their menu and you will be impressed with the fresh twist Pint Central adds.

I had an $8 Sour Silly in a bottle ($8) super tasty but a bit much for a beer in a bottle. Draft's were between $4.50 and $7.

There are two outdoor outdoor areas and plenty of casual seating on the inside. There is a sharp contract between the atmosphere and the food served.

Brussels Sprouts have been raved about on Yelp and the pesto is unexpected - it is also a larger portion for the tapas section of the menu.

Also would recommend the pork belly, chimicurri steak and the mozzarella bites.

The portions and food quality were good for the price point. Overall takeaway: I would eat there again for high quality bar fare. Highly recommend dinner here then heading across the street to FuManChu cupcakes for dessert after. Stellar combo."}
{"text":"A new favorite on Central Avenue!  Lamb lollipops were exquisite.  Avocado egg rolls come with the best sauce, I practically licked the little bowl.  Eggplant dip, cheese bites, and the pork belly are tapas to try. I loved the kimchi that came with the pork belly.  Chicken sliders have a delicious jam and cheese that makes them stand apart from other sliders.  The avocado fries are perfectly done, get these and try to keep them to yourself.  Plan to get at least 3 tapas to try for each person.  The patio outside is really chill."}
{"text":"Food is OUTSTANDING. Service is OUTSTANDING! Way to go! Great selection of sandwhiches, plates, sides, and tapas. Not to mention fanstastic variety of tap, rotating tap, and bottle selections of beer. The food is so on point it is not even funny. Great side patio. The only downfall is they allow folks to smoke on the patio where you can dine and drink."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the neighborhood and made it a point to check out every food spot within walking distance of my place. I'm so glad that I checked out Pint Central. Great good,  amazing service and welcoming atmosphere. This will definitely be one of my new go tos!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times I've just never had good service here which kills it for me. Sign up front says wait to be seated but every time I've come it takes forever for a host to come up front. I will say the hosts looked like they had their hands full though as they were running around filling water and running food and drinks all night. After be sat it takes AT LEAST 10 minutes to be greeted by a server and once you order you're lucky to see them again until you manage to flag them down to get the bill. Place has horrible acoustics as well, pretty much can't hear anyone talking unless their right next to you screaming in your ear. 

Would recommend this place as a bar but not as a restaurant. The food is pretty decent and the beer list is huge and has some of everything on it. It'd be a great place to grab a couple beers and a snack and sit on the nice patio for a chill night but I wouldn't recommend as a dinner place."}
{"text":"Great food! Get the Lamb Lollipops they're awesome. The low score is all about service. Every time we sit at the bar we wait and wait for service. Plus the beer list is very middle of the road for a place called Pint Central."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out Pint Central for a while but when I actually went, I was sadly disappointed. Me and my fiancé walked in at 1pm on Sunday with 4 people at the bar and no one else. The bar tender told us to sit anywhere, we opted for the bar, and then waited for service. It took him a few minutes to come over but he brought waters and menus. After that, he disappeared. We waited for at least 5 minutes and he was no where to be found. We ultimately decided to leave and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was truly disappointed with Pint Central. The name inaccurately describes the selection they have of draft beers. When I visited, there were few beers available, several were tapped out. The atmosphere was not at all what I expected. For being a beer place, i expected garagey/sporty or just very relaxed atmosphere. If was more of an awkward club like feeling with blue lights. Staff were not the most friendly. I don't intend on returning. I'll make the haul to Duckworth's instead."}
{"text":"I do not have a single complaint. I came here because I read go things on yelp and they stood up to hype. Plenty of beer on tap and in the bottle if thats your thing. I had the steak sandwich and herb fries- good overall. My wife had the mahi-mahi- amazing flavor! Especially for a pub like establishment. Sister in law had the chicken Cesar salad- she \"says\"good. The waitress was super nice. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I initially just thought Pint Central was another sports bar with sports bar food. Turns out they are a little bit of everything. Great drink selection and specials, a variety of things on the TVs (including the original \"Vacation\"), and AWESOME food. 

I was in a group of about 15 people, so we made a reservation and were seated immediately when we arrived. We placed drinks orders and they came out fairly quickly considering the group size. Same story for the food. 

I got the pork sandwich with parmesan fries AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN! The sandwich was one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've had not from a barbecue place and there was a great portion of the parm fries as well. 

A couple of people threw a  wrench at the waitress by using Groupons, but she handled it like a champ. Great overall experience and I will definitely recommend them for drinks or food."}
{"text":"The food came a bit short of Four Stars. 
I rounded down to 3 because of all the beer induced 5 star reviews already posted and I think this place deserved a foodie's review. 

We had lunch outside in the patio on the first day of spring, the weather was perfect, service was very good, I even ordered a draft : the stage was all set for a pleasant time, which it was. 

We ordered 4 small plates, they came out in the right amount of time, neither too quick nor too long a wait. Unfortunately everything was brought at once -as is always the case in Charlotte. No biggie.

 Korey's Eggplant dip ($6) was good, we enjoyed it - then again I always order the eggplant dips at the Greek, Lebanese, Turk etc, there are a zillion recipes. The dip is served with grilled bread smothered with melted butter. IMO it would be better if the melted butter was served on the side. 
3.5 stars for the dip 

Provoleta ($6) grilled provolone served in a cast iron skillet and (very lightly sprinkled) with herbs. I love that dish and served correctly like this was there's no way to ruin it. I've had it this many times before, sometimes seasoned more boldly but that's not a must. The grilled bread which came with it was again smothered with melted butter, not necessary for melted cheese. 
4 stars  

Choripan ($7) I ordered it because we were told the chorizo is made in house. The (very mild) spicy chorizo sandwich kicked butt, it got my taste buds dancing. It comes with a mound of skinny freshly cut fries. They were out of sweet potato fries and substituted with garlic parmesan. Tasty! For only $7 bucks it makes for a great lunch by itself, the caveat being don't order the garlic-parm it if you have a date, not even if that date will be 8 hrs later for dinner!   Grumblings aside:
4 stars

Argentine empanadas ($7 for 3 small ones)  prepared by the owner's mom - an Argie and Uruguayan tradition - now that was a tough dish to rate, here is why.  We ordered one of each : ground beef (spicy with olives), chicken and a veggie. Each of the stuffing was delicious. Now I've eaten all sorts of great empanadas(mushrooms, onions, all kinds) but when it comes to the basic 3 meat, chicken or veg, it doesn't get better than these stuffings - could have been a contender. 

Unfortunately these small empanadas were half empty (more, gimme more!) and worse : overcooked and dripping with oil from the fryer. I did mention to the junior owner that at the very least they should pat them dry (like bacon) before they served them - not sure if that registered, the waitress got it though.  There's another issue too, Argies both bake empanadas (our favorite) or deep fry them. IMO the flaky dough used here would have been better suited for baking. When the short order cook gets his act together these could be a winner but for now ....
2.5 stars.

Pint Central is a comfortable hangout with an interesting menu and moderate prices, I'd definitely like to return and try more items from their menu"}
{"text":"I love this place! I Just went again this past weekend and I probably tried almost every appetizer in the menu. The caprese stack not only looks amazing but it's simply delish, mozzarella bites, yummy. My personal favorite was the pork Belly, OMG to die for. I'm getting it next time and I'm not sharing. The service is friendly and fast. The owner 'Mario' walks around making sure you are enjoying everything and I always appreciate a good suggestion from him. I will definitely be back; I'm already craving tapas from Pint central."}
{"text":"Great selection of IPA beers and craft beers in general. Very nice staff and bar management. Highly recommend  when near central ave . Awesome stop for a beer."}
{"text":"So- I love their food. Especially their chimichurri (WAY BETTER THAN SOUL GASTRO). I come here at least once a month. Their $1 PBR is always a quick motivation to come here. HOWEVER- i came here today with a group of people around 6pm on a Sunday. The very sweet waitress informed us she forgot to turn off the sign. We asked why they were closing so early. She informed us no one showed up for their shift and not even management was picking up. This left her alone in the bar with 12 people. We were quick to order and it helped out since we all wanted draft beer. She was nervous, but a great server despite her being the only one here. It's awful a good place like Pint Central will close early on a Sunday simply because their employees and employER will not show up. Please get it together for the love of chimichurri."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Charlotte.  It has an energetic atmosphere and you can't beat an outdoor patio with live music. They have a good beer selection and the small plates are very well composed. I've always had great service and some really great encounters with the staff. Plaza Midwood stay's winning. I'll raise my pint to Pint!"}
{"text":"There is a $1 PBR on Sunday's its definitely worth a check out. The avocado egg rolls were amazing as suggested by the bartender. Very laid back bar with a welcoming environment. The turkey burger came out with the plate full of fries. A must try"}
{"text":"Came here for trivia night (Tuesdays at 8 PM). We arrived about 10-15 minutes before 8, and there were still a couple tables available and we were able to sit ourselves. There seemed to be two bartenders and two servers. The server, a male whom I do not know his name, was friendly and gave us great suggestions based on our questions. The trivia questions was fairly decent, and made us think a little, but the last trivia... oh my gosh, it was the hardest think EVER. We did not answer one correctly (fully). 
Overall, we did order the parm fries - and they were AMAZING! They were a bit crisp, but yet chewy. And we got the chipotle aioli - a  MUST!
I will definitely be back, and hopefully the questions aren't AS hard."}
{"text":"Went to Pint Central on their second night open. At that point, they were serving only apps and salads but had a full bar. The menu has a great selection and as a vegetarian, I appreciated the fact that they have vegetarian/vegan indicated on the menu next to items and the bartender explained what accomodations could be made on other items.

I had the egg rolls - can't recall the name of them but they're southwestern style and came with black beans, corn, cilantro drizzle (could be removed for vegan option). They were delicious! I also ordered the eggplant dip which had some kick to it (I like this) and came with grilled bread slices for dipping. 

My boyfriend had the shrimp/sausage skewers. He said they were fantastic. 

Their selection of beers is crazy, local and hard to find. My favorite beer - Unibroue La Fin Du Monde was on tap, which I appreciated as it is pretty hard to find outside of bottles. Bartenders were attentive and I can tell the place will become a favorite even more as the weather warms up. Great outside patio that is currently being explanded around to the front."}
{"text":"What an interesting find - a super casual bar/patio with \"upscale\" food! The fella and I visited on a Wednesday night and got spots right in front, which made me think it was gonna be a good night.

We sat inside but the garage doors were up, so it still felt like we were outside (especially with the number of flies and gnats circling our glasses - ugh). The patio looked pretty inviting, too. The concrete floors inside and super loud music/acoustics made a little nervous, but they eventually turned down the music.

Our waitress was awesome. We changed a drink order at the last minute, and she wasn't rattled; we asked for recommendations, and she steered us in the right direction.

We tried some of the tapas and got - in order of most delicious to least - the chicken sliders, brussels sprouts (yes, they're #2!), lamb lollipops, and chicken poppers. The poppers and lollipops were good but a little overcooked. The chicken sliders and sprouts were so good, I could've licked the bowl.

I'm not a huge beer person, but I was excited to see a couple of ciders on tap and sours in a bottle, and the fella who looooves beer, was really impressed to see the La Fin Du Monde on tap."}
{"text":"Good service, and nice beer selection, food was... ehhhhh.... not great - mostly because of execution; bacon on the poppers wasn't crispy and chicken was overcooked, calamari was bland and not crispy, pork belly actually seemed more like thick cut bacon and was somewhere was in between slow cooked and fried. All and all we weren't impressed by any of the dishes we sampled."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite small plate restaurants in Charlotte. All of their food was excellent having unique flavors, my favorite was the Brussel sprouts. In addition to the food they have an extensive craft beer selection and focus on North Carolina beers. All of this is wrapped up with a relaxing  sports bar type atmosphere. Pint Central has become one of my favorite restaurant destinations in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We had a great first time here last night. In fact, we stayed for five hours. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The beer list is long and nicely priced. We had the empanadas and battered cauliflower. Both were reasonably priced and very tasty. I caught a whiff of someone's garlic fries and that alone would make me return. They smelled incredible. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"After a very long day at work myself and my coworkers used Yelp to pick a good place to eat.  Pint Central was the choice based off the reviews we read and the opportunity to take advantage of the check in deal, where you get a free appetizer with the purchase of a entree.  Once we arrived at the establishment we were quickly seated and made mention to our server that we had the check in voucher to redeem.  She looked puzzled and had no clue what we were talking about.  

Our server then took our orders. We made mention to her again about the check in voucher. Our drinks came and we still hadn't heard what the managers answer was.  As our meals were being brought out that's when we were informed that the manager would only honor 1 appetizer, which was disappointing.  So we ordered the garlic shrimp and asked if they could speed the order up so we could eat it with our entrees.   

I have to say that the meals were nothing much to write home about, sub par at best.  Four of us ordered the churrasco and one ordered the meatball sandwich.  Maybe we miss read the menu but they brought out a over cooked, paper thin sliced prime rib instead of a fat juicy piece of Churrasco.  None of the steaks were cooked to order and the parm fries were basically tasteless.  The meatball sub was basically bread with 2 meatballs cut in half, with cheese draped over it to make a sandwich.  Oh yeah I didn't forget about the appetizer it's just that it still hadn't gotten to the table yet as we finished our meals.  

In the End the Garlic Shrimp appetizer was finally brought out to our table as we were paying our bill.  Overall the slow service, poorly cooked steak and management not honoring the voucher for all left us very frustrated and disappointed.  The Garlic shrimp was basically frozen shrimp baked in a Alfredo sauce which tasted very fishy and no garlic taste.  Oh and while using the bathroom the bartender used the stall and returned to the bar without washing his hands. Not Cool."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere- great selection.  One of my go to spots to grab dinner/drinks with friends.  They always have a huge beer selection and a nice side patio if it good weather.  The menu has a variety of options for everyone/all dietary needs.  I usually grab a few tapas but if you are looking for a sandwich I recommend the Mushroom.  It is a portabella grilled with balsamic and a GENEROUS portion of mozzarella cheese (parm fries are a must as the side- loaded with garlic and delicious!).  I usually go the tapas route and grab a few sides/small plates.  Hard to go wrong but the Pesto Brussels sprouts are always a must order!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day for a brunch date with my guy and was really and truly surprised at how much I liked it! We simply wanted to sit on a patio somewhere and try something new and I remembered from driving by so much that they did have outdoor seating in the front so we figured why not! Well little did I know that they actually have an extended patron around the right side of the building that opens up to an area with outdoor bar access and a number of picnic tables. It was such a relaxing atmosphere with the murals on the walls and hanging plants and a back gate access to walk your dogs through. The food was great too we both got the tacos that had a more authentic taste to them especially for bar food with seasoned chicken cilantro and onions and salsa on the side that tasted homemade and the tortillas were pretty good too! They have some great drink specials and I honestly can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like Pint Central. Have been here several times. I find the food to be very good. Their menus is a bit eclectic but I haven't had anything bad. I am in love with tapas and I think they have some very different tapas offerings. The beer here is good too. The only downside is its small inside and the parking sucks. But I do really like this place."}
{"text":"Breakfast burger? Don't debate it, just get it. The hashbrown on the burger is a great touch. It's a delicious meal. You won't be disappointed. I hear the tapas are good as well, but I didn't have more than the shrimp. Come here, eat here"}
{"text":"This place is super generic for being in Plaza Midwood which has tons of unique bars and restaurants. We didn't eat, but the menu had some interesting items. I'm not sure what they want to be though because the menu was all over the place. 

The service both at the table, and bar were really slow. I waited quite a while for a vodka soda, which was super weak. I almost wasn't sure there was any vodka in it. My husband ordered a Jim Beam and diet coke, but the diet coke was flat. I'm not sure this is a place we'll revisit."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in this place. The service was so bad.. our waitress only checked on us every 20 minutes or so and the place is SMALL. Not sure how she managed to avoid us for such long intervals. Anyway, my girlfriend ordered a beer, and when it arrived it tasted extremely sour. Passed it around for all 4 of us to try it and everyone said the same thing. Bad beer. So when we voiced that she would like another, they ended up charging us for both. Never heard of a restaurant that charges you for something you do not consume and are disatisfied with.. especially a beer! Do not recommend this place under any circumstances.. even when all the good bars are too packed to get into. Better off staying at home."}
{"text":"The staff here are super nice, but not particularly good at their job. They seem to enjoy hanging with each other, which makes for a friendly environment, but not great service. The spirits displayed would make you think that there would be great cocktails, but zero cocktails on drink menu. Okay, so it's a PINT place... I read the draft menu, ordered a draft. Not in right now. Okay, I looked up to the chalkboard and selected a different draft. Also, not available now. Finally, I selected from taps visible to me- success (?) I had a cellar temperature beer. How can you be a beer place and NOT have cold beer???

Brussel sprouts were amazing. Garlic fries strong. Skip the steak sandwich- mostly bread with three steak-UM's."}
{"text":"Came in on Friday after work. Good beer selections. Bartenders were attentive and knowledgeable. Had pineapple beer and a few others. Nice front patio and back/side patio. Great place for dogs. Had apps here before and they were great."}
{"text":"Great dinner!  We were here last night for the first time and it was great.  Located right across the street on Central from the Thirst Beaver - parking is a little tight.  We had to parka few blocks down.  

The dining area is medium size - there is a long bar, high tops and low seating around the sides.  We sat at a high top and ordered fantastic local beer.  

I also had the pork belly - WOW.  It was tender and well seasoned.  I love small plates because it is always the right amount of food.  We also had the calamari and the brussel sprouts.  The sprouts were done in a pesto sauce which I haven't had together before.  VERY GOOD and a large serving so you actually don't mind sharing this one.  The calamari was light and very large pieces which is different.  Everything was very good and service was great.  

Love this new local spot!!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome and the avocado fries are my favorite appetizer in all of Charlotte. I love their chill atmosphere and this is my go-to spot when I can't decide where to eat."}
{"text":"Good spot for meet ups. I dig the upscale bar food. Hunter, the bartender, is super rad."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would but yelp does give me the option. The service was horrible. Didn't honor yelp free app coupon."}
{"text":"Great menu for vegetarians and meat eaters! The staff is awesome; made amazing recommendations for new beers. Monday is $1 taco night!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and drinks. Favorite are the Chimichurri Beef tips. Bring back the Fig Beer on tap."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and had a ton of food that I really wanted to try but I got the avocado egg rolls and churrasco.  The avocado egg rolls was really good they had corn, black beans, and avocado with a great dipping sauce. The churrasco was definitely a gamble on my part since I hadn't had anything like it before.  It was a thinly-slick steak with some great sauce on top and I got herb fries as my side.  The fries were okay but the ranch dipping sauce was perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  I like any addition to the tap room scene for Charlotte and it looks like this place has their finger on the pulse of good beer which is ultimately important.  Add to this the great food items and proper portions and you've got a solid combination.

Service was really great and enthusiastic.  The space is somewhat raw with concrete exposed, etc. but it's accented with some very unique wood tables and the bar is also aesthetically pleasing.

Couple drawbacks is the parking is a bit difficult and you'll likely have to park around the corner on the street.  Also, the acoustics of the place are tough.  With enough people in there you'll find yourself having to talk rather loudly to communicate."}
{"text":"For drinks, great. But the food is very mediocre. Totally fine if you want a snack while drinking, but wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a meal."}
{"text":"This is a cool place too hang out.  They have a large beer  selection.  Good food choices.  The avocado eggrolls seems to be very popular. Salads are made fresh. My waiter so super cool with his man bun.  Very easy on the eyes lol.  I will definitely come back and try new things and bring a friend. This place is clean and alot of really cool art work on the walls."}
{"text":"Menu - excellent, interesting, creative, not boring. No crappy fried anything. I dream of the chicken sliders (fancy mini chicken sandwiches of goodness).

Beer - great selections

It would be more Plaza Midwood hipster-y if there weren't the huge TVs with sports on all of the time. Maybe they can mute the TVs once in a while?

The only down sides are:
-the water for some reason tastes yucky
-it's REALLY REALLY loud inside. like, really.
-the stools at the high top tables are really uncomfortable after a while, even after a few beers. Opt for the lower tables with normal chairs."}
{"text":"Let me just say...wings and Brussels sprouts baby!  I have also had the lamb lollipops and avocado fries. I have arguments with myself on what to order!"}
{"text":"I hope this place goes out of business soon! Amazing food. Great location. My dog could could provide better service. Please sell this spot to someone that cares!"}
{"text":"I am quite impressed with Pint Central. I watched their construction progress when I walked by on Central and I thought it looked smallish and like just another bar. After their opening, my beer-aficionado daughter came back with an enthusiastic endorsement. Her FAVORITE beer was on tap (Sculpin IPA.) So of course, I had to check it out with her the next night.

Inside, Pint Central is actually bigger than it appears from the street and as a great plus, they have an enclosed patio so you can enjoy your beverage outside.
What sets Pint apart is their food. We enjoyed two tapas plates - the Brussels sprouts were great and the avocado egg rolls were very good as well. NOT your normal bar food for sure.

Welcome to the neighborhood, Pint Central, you are a great addition to the other restaurants and bars along Central."}
{"text":"The food is very good, they have a great selection of beers on tap and bottled, as well as a fully-stocked bar. It gets packed pretty regularly, but it's a good place to catch a game or get a group together. 

I recently had wings which were very good, the mini empanadas (chicken was better than beef), and the beef sliders. The service was great and they even put on all 3 football games that my small group of 4 asked for : Panthers, Browns, Giants (All 3 games were on at 1pm). We greatly appreciated the gesture and it kept up from having to leave and bounce around to different bars! Thanks again!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy he sandwiches here.  Centrally located and interesting semi-urban atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decent food, about what you would expect for a bar/pub style cuisine. Avocado fries are a must, they're one of the best things on the menu! Great atmosphere. It's very hard to compete with all of the phenomenal restaurants in the hood, but I would definitely recommend Pint Central over Whiskey Warehouse and Moo & Brew etc, especially as far as the food is concerned."}
{"text":"Steak tacos are on point! They definitely don't skip on the steak! Avocado egg rolls on point. Bartenders were awesome. Samples of drafts! Love they have Kombucha. Will be coming back for Monday night $1 tacos!"}
{"text":"Went here Sunday morning. 1130, 30 minutes past the time this place is supposed to open.  No one there. No movement inside. But there were beers on the outside tables...someone apparently forgot to clean up from the night before. After reading several reviews, seems this is an ongoing problem. Doubt we'll go back. Too many other really great places around."}
{"text":"Has anyone else discovered Pint Central's side patio? Best kept secret in Charlotte, I swear! Plus, I hear they give you 10% off on Saturdays if you bring your pup. Maybe urban legend. Maybe true. We'll have to test it out one weekend soon! 

We sat at the bar in the side patio (so, you're outside it facing inside with direct access to the bar tender for all your craft beer needs) and enjoyed a few pints and bites. 

Their beer selection was great. We were there during Sugar Creek's tap take over, so there were multiple selections from them. But, they also had other good selections from the likes of Lost Coast, Birdsong, Legion, Du Claw, etc. etc. 

We stuck with tapas for food and had the brussels sprouts, yucca fries, and beef with chimichurri. Everything was pretty tasty but slightly overpriced. The yucca fries in particular were $7. That's $1 per piece of yucca. Ouch!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Such a great staff, owner, and atmosphere. Casey recommended the breakfast burger which was fantastic and she kept our table happy. This is one of the best venue in plaza midwood area!!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent addition to PM. The beer selection is incredible. $2 GOOD bloody Mary's and $2 mimosas (yelpers- we all know a cheap drink sometimes means a weak drink- not here!) You can bring dogs to the outdoor area. You can watch tv outside (a solution to the problem of losing incredible weather to watch basketball). 

The food is good- but not amazing. I'm optimistic that it will only get better. Give it time, yelp grasshoppers! We liked the wings. Avocado fries are good- but could use a little more flavoring. Lots of dishes that you can easily share. 
 
The owner is always extremely friendly. He appears very involved and dedicated. we saw him bussing tables and working his tail off- which says a lot about his character. Our waitress, Bonnie, was on point the entire time and makes you feel like a regular- even if it is your first time.

I think it will only get better and I am thrilled to see something happening in that spot."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and it's got two great patios.

Lots of tvs and they are good about putting on a game your looking for.  They've got Sunday Ticket.

The bartender was nice but it's a large bar and she was the only one working it.  We had to flag her down a couple of times.

The food is ok.  Gastropub sort of stuff.  The Cheese bites were ok but strangely wet inside so when you cut or bit into them they would squirt all over the place.  They had red peppers which I'm not a fan of but not overwhelming.

The french fries were good.  Thin curls with plenty of garlic and parmesan...very tasty.  It said they cane with garlic aioli but ours came with ketchup which was fine.

A decent selection of craft & bottled beers.  The Unibroue was very good.  

I think I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious food (even for a vegetarian like me) great environment, great selection of beers, friendly staff. What's not to like?!? It's the perfect place to spend an evening in Plaza Midwood! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was a loyal customer to Pint Central but I can honestly say after tonight, I'm never going back there. Long story short: we ordered online through THEIR website. We showed up when the food was ready and after we received confirmation of payment and the food being placed. We waited about 15 minutes for them to find my order but They didn't have anything. We had to reorder everything again and wait a good 45 minutes to get it. The short, tan waitress with a buzzcut dealing with our order was in a terrible mood and didn't help at all. We then received a receipt to pay yet I already payed on THEIR website. It was absolutely insane. I was asked to pay double due to them not knowing how to work their website and waiting for about an hour and a half after ordering online. It was completely disorganized and the service to help solve the problem was useless. It was a waste of time and now I'm eating dinner at 8:45 PM in my home, which is insane. I'm never going back there. I'd rather give my $$ to other local businesses who treat their customers better."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and drinks are great. Definitely try the sliders, Brussels sprouts, and caprese stack. Service could use some work and has been slacking lately (we miss hunter). It seems to take a long time to get anyone's attention at the bar lately"}
{"text":"Nice selection of beers and a really lovely use of the outdoor space at Pint Central. It was great seeing the owner out and about and I can definitely see this as a place I will go to grab a drink after work, or to meet up with friends on weekends in the summer. I didn't realize they served food-but it all looked pretty tasty to me, so I will update when I return. 

A couple of suggestions... It would be great if they had a few cider or fruit beer options for those that enjoy that. Also, parking is REALLY tight so plan on walking or parking on the street."}
{"text":"Third trip; consistent experience. Nice beer selection, good food, and particularly interesting vegetarian options but terrible service. Wait staff is inattentive to the point that I'm just about ready to leave...."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon. I had no idea what to expect, other than reading fantastic reviews about the food. I met a friend on a Monday which happens to be Two Dolla Make Ya Holla Taco Night (that's my name, not theirs..) [Fine print: Groupon is good for any food except the food on special.]

We sat at the bar, since it was steamier than Hell's basement outside. Maybe next time we'll choose the huge patio area...

Took a hot minute to decide what our starting beverages would be.. I wasn't enamored by the beer choices plus I wasn't sure if I even wanted a pint. A dude came around and kept asking what we wanted sure, but he seemed a bit pushy about making me a drink. Turns out he was the owner, Mario. I mean - I am at the bar so I'm definitely not going to sit here without drinking, but no need to be pushy about whether or not I had decided. The place wasn't busy I'll take my time if I so please... He went down some talk about whiskey, which I won't bore you with...

Everything we decided to order off the tapas menu was fantastic! Bravo to whomever created these delicacies! Avocado Egg Rolls: Holy **blank**; Milenesas: Ahh Mahh Gahhd; 'fried cheese on a skillet with bread crisps thingy': Very Good.

Bar service lacked a bit, even though the bar area wasn't very busy. I know the patio was busy - but that shouldn't affect my service."}
{"text":"We had a trip to Uptown Charlotte, NC last night. Went to Pints Central. I was apprehensive about the food thinking it was BAR food, WAS I WRONG. When I seen the menu, I thought it was a very advantageous menus for a Beer Garden. Was I surprised, the food was excellent and the service was very friendly and we didn't want for anything. The food was very well done with the flavor profiles and a lot of thought went into the flavors and food pairings. This is not BAR FOOD and it's tastefully done. I would highly recommend trying this establishment. Also the other cool thing was local beer, and I mean local. Taps are changed nightly according to the staff. Great place to try, you will not be disappointed. Also side note, met Mr. Foo cupcake guy. What a cool guy with a very cool story. I will try his cupcakes next we are in the area."}
{"text":"Update! The service was great! Improvements have been made! Bar staff was very attentive during volume. The GM made a point to make sure this experience was better. I will be back pint central!"}
{"text":"With a name like Pint Central, you'd expect to see a place that is nothing but beer. Not true here. 

What makes this place stand out? The menu. Mario has done a great job. I could easily order $40 worth of food for myself. 

Creative tapas plates. I love the avocado egg rolls and the Brussels Sprouts. The Brussels are a good sized dish that is good for sharing. Mozzarella bite rangoons are also tasty. The basil, roasted pepper and balsamic glaze are a great combination. Typical prices for tapas style plates.

I want to try a lot more on this menu. There's a beet panini on there calling my name. It sounds delicious. The NoDa Jam Session Bread Pudding sounds like something I also need in my life. Bunch of TVs here. This would be a nice spot to watch a game. The patio is pretty cool. There's a roll up garage door so you can order without waking back inside. 

Hunter is great behind the bar. He's there almost every day. Seriously, when does this guy get a day off? He's such a hard worker. Super nice. 

Congrats to the crew here on a solid spot in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"Decent food and beer, but the service was pretty terrible on a Friday night.

I was originally pumped to find Pint Central - finally, a place with decent food where I can watch a sports event (in this case, the NCAA tournament)! The food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the baked provolone, and the mushroom flatbread is worth ordering as well. 

Unfortunately, the service and beer availability was severely lacking. Our poor waitress was literally running around trying to accommodate all of her tables, and she had continuous issues with the bar serving up her/our drinks in a timely fashion. Additionally, they were out of several beers listed on their menu that we tried ordering. I could have understood one or two being out, but there were at least four beers listed that had kicked.

The waitress was really sweet and did a wonderful job, and she even discounted some of the food/drinks that took a long time to come out. I would definitely come back for beer or food, but perhaps on a less busy night when they have an appropriate staff:customer ratio."}
{"text":"Food is very good for a craft bar spot. Great menu and selection of beers, cider, etc. Recommend the chicken sandwich and parm fries."}
{"text":"Went for brunch yesterday. Took some friends from out of town. The food here used to be interesting and good and it has gone seriously downhill. We went around 12:30 after there being a 45 minute wait a couple doors down at Moo&Brew.
There were only two seated tables in the restaurant and one person working both the bar and floor. I guess that is telling of how business is going, unfortunately. The server was kind but not very knowledgeable. They were also out of a few things.

I ordered a house salad with steak and it was so gross. The steak was chewy and thin and the salad looked was very watery and full of chopped red onions and big chunks of carrots. I was seriously beyond disappointed. The kids flat bread pizza was gross. You know if a kid won't eat bread with cheese on it, something is wrong.

Apparently the burgers were pretty good, but the Parmesan Fries were lackluster.
Doubt we will return"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect fit for those looking for a more laid back place in the Plaza Midwood area. I came here on a Monday night and there was a pretty good cross for it being a weekday.

The interior is decorated nicely and featured artwork from local artists for sale. It gave the place a nice vibe that I liked. The servers were friendly and were attentive. 

For beer I got a pale ale that was on draft. It was crisp and had a slight fruity flavor. For food I got the Korean burger with parm fries. The burger was juicy and had a nice spice thanks to the sauce. The burger was topped with pork belly which was a tasty addition. The fries were crispy and had just enough cheese. 

Overall this was a great place to grab a drink and dinner!"}
{"text":"Awesome bartenders that really know their stuff! I've only came here twice but those two times were a great experience. They mix up these concoctions and it's almost like its personalized for you. Just tell them what you like as a liquor base and they can pretty much take it from there. They have a nice outside area that has a foosball table and some picnic benches. They are also dog friendly, at least in the outside area from what I can see. I recommend this place to anyone looking for some quality adult beverages."}
{"text":"I sampled their food at Yelp's Freaky at the Factory event. Going off that, I look forward to visiting the restaurant.  The chicken-wrapped bacon was delicious, and the fried avocados are something I will certainly order."}
{"text":"Very good service! Our bartender was awesome and very attentive (forgot his name but sleeves on his arms!) Very laid back comfortable environment! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Pint Central! Great selection of beer and the food is so good! The patio is my favorite place to chill!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because I live down the street and the convenience is super ideal. I've been here twice now, so hoping third times the charm?

We went in today for a beer because their patio is adorable and great and it was a super great patio day. While the patio is great, table service on the patio was unfortunately non existent, so we went to the bar outside (also a great idea and convenient) but the bartenders didn't even check on the outside bar. So we then went inside to the bar, and it took three movements down the bar for someone to notice us. Finally, when they did notice us (yay!) it took several more minutes (it felt like eons but really, what doesn't when you're waiting to drink your beer in the sunshine) for them to bring the beers and run my card. I know they're new and have some kinks to work out, and it really pains me to complain about service, but it was disappointing (at least everyone was nice!).

We also were there for one of their soft openings, and while everyone was friendly then too, service was slow that night as well (which is understandable kinks and all and it was really busy). We tasted some of the food and it was ok, but nothing out of this world. The music was also super loud (god I feel like a grandmother for saying that) and the atmosphere I guess just wasn't for me.

The beer selection is good (but on par and similar to many other places in the area that I love...hello Kickstand!!!) and the patio is nice so I'll probably give them another chance, but might wait a few weeks for those kinks."}
{"text":"This place is not bad to grab a quick drink and some appetizers.  It gets really busy depending on the night, and I know they offer trivia sometimes.  They have good deals throughout the week.  10% off on Saturdays when you bring your dog-how cool is that?!  They have an indoor and outdoor space, which of course is great and gives us different options.  

The service is quick.  The apps a delish-try the eggrolls (yum) and the people are pretty darn friendly.  Overall, not exactly a date spot, but fun bar scene and plenty of room."}
{"text":"I was eager to check out pint central's food and bar scene, and my expectations were mostly met. Beer selection is on point - bartender recommended the weyerbacher imperial stout which was well balanced. I will add this one to my favorites. 

Parking situation is kind of a nightmare. I don't think pint central has more than ten spots to its name, which leaves everyone else to scramble to find street parking or park in the gravel lot across the street next to thirsty beaver. This necessitates a dash across busy central avenue after, which I was not a fan of. 

Food situation was ok. I was honestly expecting better based on what I had heard, but it was solid given most come here for a drink with food as an afterthought. Mozzarella bites were tasty but over breaded in my opinion. Red peppers were a nice touch though. I had the churrasco which turned out to be very thin slices (almost gyro style) pieces of meat accompanied by fries. The meat had plenty of flavor but I was underwhelmed by the portion size, and it seemed as though the same meat was used in the steak sandwich my friend ordered at a portion of the price. 

Overall I had a good time, but given parking and food, I won't be adding this one to my regular rotation."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try pint central for a long time and we finally made it in. We had a group of 8 and got a table in the back for food and drinks.  The beer list is very extensive and the menu is packed with goodies. The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful but we did had some issues getting the food out all at once. I had the shrimp tacos that weren't my favorite. 
With all that said, I wasn't going to give PC a five star review.... but! The reason I am is because of the owner. After seeing my post of the picture of the shrimp tacos and my comment, he came over to the table to talk to me personally and apologized for the tacos and the service.  For this, I will give PC 5 stars and return again! Businesses that are willing to learn and grow from mistakes are the best places to frequent!"}
{"text":"I really never write reviews, but this group deserves it.  I had a great experience there before, and then my wife and I went and had a wonderful meal together.  The food is really, really good and they have many healthy options. The drink menu helps as well, but it is really nice to have this group in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If I could give half stars, I would give this place 3.5 stars. The best part of the trip to me was the beer list. There were tons of draft options (and they are on special on Wednesday, so be sure to go then). I had Windy Hill Gala Peach and really liked it. I didn't love that the water came out at room temperature with no ice, but our waitress brought us some when we asked. 

I really liked the taste of the sliders, although I wish the patty had been bigger because the bun overpowered it. The taste of the garlic curly fries was good but the fries weren't really curly. They were more of a curved shoestring. All in all, the taste of the food was good but I wish it had been executed better."}
{"text":"Great tapas, great sandwiches, great beer, great art, what more do you want? Stop in on Thursday night for half of tapas. The Korean burger is great!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I ordered a couple of craft beers. I had Argentinian style beef empanadas and they were really good. They have eggs and raisins which it's a nice touch (not the egg, but it's not overbearing) I pair it with cilantro-avocado aioli (they charge extra) because it doesn't come with a dipping sauce. For the main entree I had the Churrasco with fries as my side, they were really good too. They put Parmesan cheese on them. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium well. Can't expect it to be perfect because it's not a steak house but it was flavorful. The bartender was nice. They didn't have a lot of people when I was there but they got a few orders to go. Overall this place is a good place to check out."}
{"text":"The food and the beers offered (on tap and in bottles/cans) are AMAZING. I almost cannot come without getting the avocado fries. The cauliflower bites, jalapeño chicken poppers, mini burgers, and garlic Parmesan fries are just a few awesome tapas. The turkey sandwich and breakfast burger are delicious. And the entrees are even better! $1 tacos on Mondays I think are still a thing and I could eat a million they're so good. Love it!"}
{"text":"The drink selection here can't be beat. They have something for everyone and can make good recommendations. The food is also delicious. We got the cauliflower bites, chicken sliders, beef sliders, avocado egg rolls, chicken poppers, and Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious. The avocado egg rolls and beef sliders were my favorites. While the cauliflower bites were good, the bigger pieces did not get cooked all the way and still had uncooked batter in them. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had to update my review on this place because wow how things have changed in the year that I was gone! Trivia night ok awesome should have a good crowd. We decided to stop in for a few beers not the trivia as I was in the office late.

Bartenders could not be more apathetic in this place. After standing politely at the bar (which was full with trivia players, but not customers asking for drinks) for over five minutes, I had to waive down a bartender. I'm not standing here for fun, I'm standing here waiting to be acknowledged. Asked for a beer list to which the bartender obliged, but had to go find one (another two minutes of waiting) then instead of letting me quickly read over it he disappeared again. The whole process of ordering a beer when no one else was waiting was literally a 10 minute ordeal. Then to make matters worse, prices have gone up here so I paid $7 for a beer I could get for $4.50 next door at Moo and Brew. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't mind paying a bit more for the same beer if the ambiance and service matched the up charge, but it didn't. The bartender was unenthused handling me the beer and when I said 'thank you' didn't even bother to respond.

But wait...there is more. Went out to the patio for a more quiet atmosphere the waitress stops by after a few shots of tequila to ask if we wanted anything else. I asked if she could bring another beer list and she responds that she is going to change a few of the kegs quickly and will be right back. Ok....two thoughts on this: 1.) bring me a list now, so I can look over it while you are changing the kegs 2.) this was an opportunity for you to sell me a beer already on tap while you changed kegs and lines and then sell me a second one based on saying its a freshly tapped keg. Needless to say the girl never came back with a beer list or my friends tequila shot. 

Also, note to management your staff lost the tab and instead of trying to clear the air they walked around asking each other frantically what we had to drink. Why not just approach us, fess up to the mistake (they happen, no big deal), and ask us what we had. Instead they put together a bill that was completely inaccurate. 

I heard through the grapevine that this place has new ownership (may or may not be true), but my advice would be to have a staff training ASAP. There are way too many bars in Charlotte with staff who at least act like they want to be there and value you as a customer for me to frequent an establishment where clearly I was not valued as a customer or a human being for that matter."}
{"text":"I want to love this place with all my heart BUT!!!! they will not let me if they are not out of one thing it's another no food this week last week no liquor the people are great but they can only do so much with what they have and it's basically nothing and on a Saturday night no less"}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews of Yelp, but I felt I needed to for Pint Central. The interior is warm and inviting with many, but not an overbearing, number of televisions. The staff was friendly and quick to get our beer order from the great selection of craft beers on tap. The menu seemed to have some great selections at a good price, but this is where the praise ends.

I ordered the Choripan, an Argentinian sausage sandwich with chimichurri sauce. On the side, sweet potato fries. My fiance had a grilled turkey sandwich, and her brother, the breakfast burger. We also had a couple of apps.

Our food arrived quickly and hot, the sweet potato fries were delicious. My fiance really liked her turkey sandwich. Everything else we received was salted so incredibly heavily I almost couldn't finish eating it, and I'm not one to waste food. If they cut the salt back by about 40-60% and the seasoning on their garlic fries back just a touch, it would have been a much better experience. I can't say I'd go back, unless just for some beers, because the food was just far too salty and I'm not a picky eater."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick beer and eats on a weeknight. 

We are in town for a long business trip and our air b&b hosts suggested this for late night beer and light dinner.

Monday night was $1 tacos and $3 Latin beer.

The avocado egg-roll was good. We had veg, chicken and beef tacos. Great for quick eats! 

Lots of tv's for the game or whatever you can't tear yourself away from.

Parking is horrible. We had to park at the family dollar lot and walk (just a block).

Nice bar tenders."}
{"text":"Excited to try this new place in my neighborhood.  Entering Pint Central, we expected for it to be more crowded on a Friday night, but that was not the case.  Good for me, because I don't like crowds.  The interior was open and decorated in a minimalist style.  We told the hostess, \"2\" when she asked us how many.  She responded, \"are you sure?\" which I found a bit odd.  I don't think that she  meant to say that.
We ordered the mozzarella bites, avocado fries, calamari and Brussels sprouts.  The first three were typical fried bar food, but those Brussels sprouts were something special.  They were chargrilled and tossed with pesto.  How brave of them to put Brussels sprouts on their menu.  And how delicious they were!  My next favorite were the mozzarella bites.  We could have used a few more of them.  The avocado fries needed more flavor, and the calamari was a bit on the rubbery side.
I would like to try more items from their menu, especially the beet panini.  And, I am definitely going back for more Brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"This place has a super chill vibe. With it's fairy lights and outside patio, it evokes sweet summer memories complemented by the excellent variety of drinks. The restrooms are surprisingly clean and well lit - not what I was expecting given the rest of the decor, but it proved to be a very pleasant discovery. As the night progresses, it teeters slightly off it's cool throwback vibe pedestal into a dark grungy alleyway abyss, but if you leave on time, it's all good."}
{"text":"I live nearby, but didn't try it out for a long time. Note it is my go to lunch spot. Good specials. ($7 sandwiches for lunch weekdays). Discount drafts on Wednesday. 
Great food and beer. 
I score on quality, price, and atmosphere.
Maybe a 4 everyday, and a five on Wednesdays"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Michael is a great bartender... The garlic park fries are out of this world! Never liked them before... Most of the crowd is laid back, a few get too pretentious... Full of themselves, but the staff is not that way... Look, go check it out."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for dinner on a Sunday night and once on a late Saturday night and both times were great! 

Bar atmosphere review: The indoor area has lots of seating and a long bar. The outdoor back patio area is also pretty neat- check that out if the weather is nice. They are also dog friendly. The dinner crowd were 20-somethings, trendy, slightly hipster and not too loud. The night scene is louder and gets more crowded but the wait time for drinks isn't too long in my experience

Food review: The chicken poppers were good, not spicy at all, slightly overpriced for 4 poppers. The breakfast burger is big, if you're not starving you could get an app, split the burger and that could be a decent meal for two girls. It didn't blow me away like other \"breakfast-style\" burgers I've had in the past, but it tasted good. The buffalo wings at the bar are SPICY! I enjoy spicy food, and usually don't even find buffalo wings that hot, but these are red-hot! If you're into that, you'll love these but if you just like a normal buffalo wing these may be too much unless you drown them in ranch/bleu cheese. Good wings though, lots of meat on the bone and not much fat."}
{"text":"$2 mimosas on Sundays!! Avocado fries and beet sandwich are delish, patio is perfect on a sunny day and there's even a little window so you can be at the bar and still be outside"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!!! Avocado egg rolls are my favorite!! I love the beer list and the drink specials. I like that they have outdoor seating so you can bring your dogs."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on one specific experience. I should preface that by saying that this is a place I come to for dinner at least once every month or two. 

I love lots of things about Pint Central but the experience we had tonight just plain sucked. The restaurant was not crowded (maybe 1/3 full, max) but service was extremely, extremely slow. No apologies or explanation when it took several minutes from when we sat down till we first saw our server (that's fine, it happens) and no apologies or explanation when it took 35+ minutes to get our food (basic sandwiches from the menu, nothing tricky whatsoever). We didn't see our server at all between ordering the food and then getting it 35+ minutes later. That part is not cool - I definitely would have liked to have our presence/status of the food/drink refills at least recognized. Once the meals finally came, the server asked if we'd like any sauces on the side and recommended a horseradish aioli among other things. We agreed to try that and a couple others. When the bill came, each sauce had a $.50 up charge. That is fine to charge for sauces - but not cool to not tell us up front! The whole experience was just super disappointing. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the food was mostly fine when it did come out. I will say that about half of the roasted potatoes were undercooked but by that point I was so hungry that I didn't really care. 

Will I go back? Maybe. I love supporting local places in the neighborhood, but Pint Central needs to up their game if they want to build/keep loyal customers."}
{"text":"Pint Central is a hidden gem in Charlotte. I went on Saturday night for a birthday dinner; we were with a pretty big group (around 15) and the group leader called ahead. Pint Central had a table set up for us when we arrived, which was really awesome! 

When you walk in, you're in a big open space with a long bar on the right. It's got a clean feel, not real divey like some of the other spots in Plaza. They also have an outdoor area in the back, but it was too cold to be out there.

Pint Central does have a lot of beers on tap, but not as many as you may think given the name. We came for a late dinner, so I ate some snack at home beforehand because I was so hungry. I ended up order a small plate - the caprese - as my meal. It was DELICIOUS. It was sliced avocado topped with tomatoes, basil, their homemade mozzarella, and a balsamic glaze (see photo). The burgers looked delicious. I tried my fiance's parmesan fries... OH MY GOSH. They were so good. 

The only reason I rate Pint Central 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took a really long time to get our checks. Now, I do recognize that were in a big group, there was a groupon, there were multiple separate checks and some couples paying together --- a lot going on. It just seemed a little too long, even given the circumstance. Other than that, our service was great throughout the dining experience.

ANYWAY, I will definitely be back to Pint Central and I highly recommend it to others. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely a fan of this little joint!  Several beers on tap in regular rotation.  Local and beyond.  The food is pretty on point for a place more known as a drinking spot.  Wings, yucca fries, beef sliders, chicken sliders, beef tips, and more.  They have an outdoor patio outback and some covered seating out front.  They offer half price small plate apps before 7pm on Thursdays, which is an incredible deal, and they have regular beer specials.  The servers are usually friendly, though at times a little slow.  Parking would be the only downside, as the lot offers, give or take, 15 spaces shared between 3 businesses.  You typically have to fight for parking on the adjacent street, but it's not too bad."}
{"text":"One of my go to places in plaza! Great vibes, food and trivia! (Come early on Tuesdays, trivia night gets pretty crowded)

The beer and avocado fries are on point!"}
{"text":"I got a taste of Argentina and it tastes as great as it looks. The Empanadas and the Chroipan are a must try. I preferred the beef over the chicken empanadas but can't go wrong either way. The pork belly is addictive with each light but flavorful bite!"}
{"text":"This is. Pretty awesome ace to go in plaza midwood. Don't get me started on the beer and drinks. Let's talk about how they make fresh mozzarella here daily. Yes. Along with everything thing else they make in house. This is a foodies dream. For apps the mini burgers are going to melt in your mouth. Seriously no need to chew this one, or all 3. I mean it has candied bacon jam on them them. The pork belly is also heavy served with kimichi. Also homemade. Avocado fries, I don't know how they get them to be just like potato fries but these things pack some flavor and crisp! You also don't feel so bad because it's avocado :) roasted Brussels sprouts are not bad either, and I am not a fan of Brussel sprouts. So anyone that can get me to eat them is a plus in my book. The best thing a foodie can do is go with a friend or more and just order the menu and all share. Because everything here is good."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place for some lunch and some drinks. Met the owner/chef while sitting at the bar with a friend, friendly guy from Argentina. We started off with some liquor drinks and I went for their 5$ Jameson special. For lunch my friend and I shared the mushroom goat chases bruschetta which was amazing and a must get if you like mushrooms. We split the steak sandwich and avocado egg rolls for the rest of our lunch and enjoyed those as well. A chill environment during the day time when we were there. Not sure about nights or game days though. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I am not one to leave a bad review because I work in the service industry, but when you go to a restaurant twice and have horrible service twice by the same girl. That's horrible. She brought out two of my friends check. And took forever on our food and drinks. Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We paid with a Groupon which was an awesome deal! Well worth it. They open at 11, we arrived at 11:45 and it was dead. We discovered the back outdoor enclosed patio. Overall the server was the best! She had such a fun personality and her suggestions were sincere. She made our visit fun and the food was Bomb! I mean we were very impressed with our service and are soo eager to return to try more of the menu. We have the house sausage sandwich and Korean burger. Freakinggg amazing unique flavors you won't find anything like it! And of course the beer was the last straw. This Groupon deal was the best one yet!"}
{"text":"The food here is OUT OF THIS WORLD! The chicken sliders are my favorite along with the BLT salad. I really wish they would sell the basil aioli dressing by the bottle. I would put it on EVERYTHING! The staff is always really friendly when I go there, I even held a Christmas party here! Love it"}
{"text":"Every couple of months I wonder why I don't go here more often, so I go. Then I'm SLOWLY reminded why I don't. The service is the worst! While I understand that on a holiday weekend things get crazy (Memorial Day weekend) we were 2 of 8 people in the entire place. While the one guy behind the bar proceeded to talk with 2 of the customers for 10 minutes he lost out on the 9th and 10th customers of the night. I had a few more minutes of patience in me. Finally ordered a couple of drinks, the crowd turned to 6. Finally ordered food the crowd turned to 2. Food was good (saving grace). All that being said if in a couple of months I wonder why I haven't been hopefully I read this and go somewhere else."}
