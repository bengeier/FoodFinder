{"text":"No complaints here, 5/5. For comparison if you've ever been to a jets pizza before they use the same method to prepare their crust so that it's all crispy, but the bread is not deep dish like jets. I prefer bogo's method here  I ordered the large serious pepperoni with sausage and it was splendid, after eating clean for a month I treated myself and would definitely order again! If I didn't have to start eating clean again ha maybe in a month or so; this is definitely  not something you should eat weekly"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Cleveland Heights! I love the unique topping combinations. Currently, \"The Bombay\" and \"The Chicago\" are my usuals. It's a bit on the pricier side but you get what you pay for: quality pizza, loaded with fun toppings."}
{"text":"Their pizza might be a little on the pricey side, but it's worth it!  This was among the best pizza I've ever had and I am a picky eater.  Whether you just want a traditional pepperoni (which, bonus, is pork free here) or a fancy world flavor, they are amazing.  

I was skeptical about paying $20 for two large pizzas, but the flavor was out of this world and like nothing else being offered around here.  All the toppings you could ever ask for, all the veggies were super fresh and so much cheese!!!

Seriously, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome topping combinations and options. We love this place! The pizza is SO good. I got pizza from this place for my son's birthday party last summer, and the guests absolutely raved about it. I am planning on doing that again for my kids' parties in the future. Five stars!"}
{"text":"A great place to pick pizza. Wide selection with tasty choices. My personal favorites are the milano and the tuscan. Go on wednesdays and you can get their deal of one large pizza for only five bucks."}
{"text":"This place has O.K pizza however it is operated by the most rude ignorant pig ive ever met in my life. I arrived to pick up my pizza and was told that it went home w another customer and that the customer was bringing it back so that it could be given to me. Not only is this DISGUSTING but its illegal as theres no way to know what the other person has done to the food. I pointed this info out to the mgr who had addressed the issue in front of his own customers and was subsequently kicked out bc a customer asked me what had happened and I told them the truth. The manager/owner...whatever he is is a total ass and has no clue how to properly handle customer issues and I would never want food from here again seeing as how it could've gone home w someone else before me."}
{"text":"I am hard critic but this is absolutely must try just had there Bombay excellent. I am from NY and for me pizza is big deal and they got it just right at this joint 1 thing prices are not what are listed here there 9 inch was $9 not 6.50 and so on. But not mad because it was really good"}
{"text":"Consumer beware. The rudest people I have ever dealt with. I will never order here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pizza spot in Cleveland Heights.  The pizza is terrific and they have so many choices that we can try something new each and every time (I never do though - I'm a creature of pizza habit).  I put the BOGO spice in everything, and I even like the miracle crust pizza - I don't know if it's healthy but it definitely tastes great."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza here for the first time recently and I think I may have now found a new favorite pizza place.  I wanted to try them since they opened and it was definitely worth it! It was so good!  They even have a nice comfortable couch to lounge on if you need to sit and wait for your order.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy my pizzas from BOGO. They keep their fresh ingredients fresh by offering great deals every Tues and Weds - cash and carry only these nights. Great crispy, thick and greasy crust quality that makes you hope the dog isn't waiting on it for a little charity. Wish they had a better location, it's at a congested intersection with a bad traffic and parking pattern and very little off street parking - on the west side of the bldg. This is takeout only, no dining room."}
{"text":"I love PizzaBOGO for their super customizable pizzas. You can ask for a menu and it will show all of the vegan options they have. A good number of the sauces and, of course, all of the vegetables are vegan. If they could get vegan cheese I would give them 5 stars but the sauces almost make up for it."}
{"text":"Lots of interesting pies there.  I'm kind of surprised its Buy One Get One Free for the quality.  I was expecting cardboard tasting pies.  Not true."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome here and very unique I have only been there once but I drove across town to get there and wasn't disappointed we had this Chicago style type pizza and it was very god"}
{"text":"This place is ok however the owner/mgr does not know how to operate a business. Hes very rude and adjusts the terms of coupons so that they cannot be used. Pizza is overpriced and the owner is a dirty slob. Just an overall bad experience and needs new mgmt ASAP. I wont be going back."}
{"text":"A pretty nice little pizza joint on the East Side.  This part of Cedar Road is a complete nightmare.  The parking sitation is not good and with Melt moving in has gotten even worse.  The pizza is creative and well thought out.  If you try Pizzabogo don't expect to get a standard pie.  They have alot of different types that help mix things up.  Tuesday and Wednesday 6 bucks for a large.  Can't beat it if you are in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"This is an update (2 stars before)... They have changed the quality of their pizza a few times... I'm talking all new recipe (crust, topping amount, etc.). But they did return to a better recipe. This pizza is back to being one of the best in the area. However, the delivery sucks, I've had to tell 2 different drivers that they didn't give me back the right amount of change... like they couldn't count (maybe why they're delivering pizza)... so they might try to rip you off and see if you don't notice. Also it's still sad that BOGO lost its concept of being BOGO (buy one get one)... but it's still good pizza, so it gets 4 stars for the food alone. Just make sure to pick it up or count your change before the driver slips away."}
{"text":"First time at this place and I was blown away instantly. We ordered the French quarter and Chicago stuffed pizzas. They were not only delicious, but surprisingly healthy. Didn't feel bloated afterwards at all. 

They also do a buy one get one free deal, so we ordered 4 specialty pizzas and it came out to be $36 total. What a deal. 

French quarters pizza had shrimp!! What an amazon pizza. Go and try it out for yourself and be amazed."}
{"text":"Probably the best tasting pizza I have had in my life. Quality ingredients and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Milano here is my THE favorite pizza. I love everything in it - balsamic glaze, roasted garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh spinach/arugula blend.

I have tried the Bombay one before. Did not like it too much (the curry flavor was too strong for me). I would love to see a Chicken Tikka pizza on their menu (I am sure it will taste fantabulous).

I wish they had dine-in, so that I can have the pizza fresh from the oven, instead of the slightly cooled down pizza at my home. I am sure if they open a new location with dine-in, it will do very well.

PS:
- The pizzas cost only $7 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (cash only)!
- The large size is not really the usual large size. It is more like a medium size in my opinion.
- They do have a parking lot for carry-outs. If you are going from Lee to South Taylor, it is the one that comes before the Pizza BOGO location, not the one after it. I was so confused the first time!"}
{"text":"Wow, Pizza Bogo has some of the finest pizza in Northeast Ohio!  In general, the pizzas all taste incredibly fresh, and the prices are amazing!  It's the type of pizza that tastes great while you're eating, but doesn't leave you feeling weighed down when you're finished.  Additionally, the menu is very friendly to those who restrict pork from their diets.  All of the pizzas we ordered were out of this world: Bangkok, Tuscan Fiorentina, Milano, Napa Valley, and Meat Works.  Both the original crust and the Miracle Crust were spectacular.  Even the Bread Stix with marinara and garlic sauce was awesome, but I'd rather eat pizza!"}
{"text":"We had a great pizza and wonderful breadsticks at pizzaBOGO tonight! My brother and I are visiting from Oregon and CT but we grew up on the west side of Cleveland. We were staying at a nearby hotel with our families and wanted to find  a good pizza place in the neighborhood. What a pleasant surprise to find this gem! Thank you to the manager for his gracious and warm reception and a treat of breadsticks while we waited! The pizza was perfect! The crust on the pan pizza was delicious!! Perfect sauce and cheeses too!"}
{"text":"This place is Baaadddd. The Manager is complete ahole. He twists around terms of coupons. Beware of Bogo spice really bad. Pizza is below average and service is non existent"}
{"text":"It's good enough, in Cleveland Heights your best bet is Marottas but they don't deliver- pizza bogo does. Not sure what's bogo about it- I paid for both pizzas, not a deal either at $25 for 2 pies. Not bad though, it gets the job done- delivery guy was cool and got here fast. Pizza bogo is worth it when it's worth it"}
{"text":"The crust and the sauce were perfect - crunchy on the outside, nice and pizza-ey on the inside. The salad was huge and I was able to adjust it to my specifications."}
{"text":"What can I tell you that you don't already know? Great pizza? You know that. Awesome Tue-Wed deal? Common knowledge. This is a great place, and my favorite one to try different/new things!"}
{"text":"Lets put it this way, I wish this place was still Georgios! what does that tell ya. Ive never been so angry after eating food, this pizza was so gross. The sauce taste like spaghettios sauce and they only have beef toppings and beef bacon was like beggin strips for my dog. I will never return to this place even if it was free for life!!!"}
{"text":"Well, PizzaBOGO is absolutely the most bold thing that has happened to Pizza since deep dish pizza. May be there are other things that have happened that I am not aware off, because I have not been to San Fransisco!! 

PizzaBOGO is locally owned pizza place in Cleveland or NE Ohio area. All of their meat is halal or kosher so that is a plus when you are ordering food for someone with religious restrictions. They have classic pizza and many different varieties. I have tried almost all of their sauces and they are delicious. They have some kind of offer everyday that makes this place desirable and economical for college students or people who feel like not cooking regularly. I have had many of my friends hooked on to this place after introduced only once. 

Their customer service and wait time is right on. I have never had to wait too long for a pizza ever. Food quality has been consistent at all locations in Cleveland. A must visit place if you are hungry for pizza."}
{"text":"Pizzabogo is fun for a bachelor but it is more fun when you are trying to be nice to your co-workers. BOGO deals are very helpful when ordering food for masses. How can you not like their selection of wonderful toppings and cheeses and sauces and delivery service to wherever you are. 

I recently ordered their specialty pizza and was so impressed by it that I had to write another review about it. This is the best bet for a delicious pizza in the neighborhood. 

Making pizza is an art and making delicious pizza based with international ingredients is the best display of this art I have seen. Marvelous pizza with pocket friendly prices."}
{"text":"OMG! Living in Lakewood we have no shortage of quality pizza choices.  I like a full bodied sauce, a little spicy kick with generous sausage or pepperoni.  Generous but not over the top.  You know it when you see it.  Add mushrooms and the perfect combination is pure heaven!

And I think I found Heaven!

If you get what I am saying and it clicks with you.....this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is for the Tuesday/Wednesday deal only. A little too pricey otherwise, but these pizzas are really freaking good. It gets kind of hectic, though, with that deal, so be prepared to wait a while for your pizza."}
{"text":"On the way home from a long day I asked my friend who lives in Cleveland Heights what pizza place he likes and without a pause he said Pizza BOGO.  He said the pizza was terrific and that they delivered. At home I asked my wife if she was up for pizza on a Saturday night when we wanted to stay in and watch movies and she was willing to try something new. I called BOGO and asked if they'd deliver to near Shaker Square. They got my zip code asked me to hold the line while they checked and then told me that my address was in the delivery area. I ordered a large Meat Works and a Bianco, both on traditional crust. He said delivery would be in 45 to 60 minutes and I set a timer to see how long it actually would take. The pizzas arrived in 30 minutes. 

The smell was tantalizing and the taste of each one was over the top. My wife declared that these were to two best pizzas in Cleveland and we weren't going anywhere else in the future. We warmed up some leftovers the next day in a toaster oven and they were just as good. Looking forward to trying their other options soon."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I have a cold pizza sitting  here. Veggie Works... Cold... Tough... I ate 2 slices and feel gross. I recommend carry-out only. And even then, I would check the pizza before you leave."}
{"text":"This place has become my new Wednesday night tradition. They have a deal for $7 large pizzas with any topping on Tues and Wed. You have to pay in cash though. These large pizzas are not LARGE-large-- they feed about 2 hungry people. I usually get the specials, and I've tried the Bomnay (my favorite), Thai, Mediterranian, French Quarter, Tuscan Florentina, probably some more that I've forgotten. Anyway, because they have a lot of different flavors, this place is super interesting and I never get bored of it. Some of the toppings are kinda different... like shrimp on pizza in the Thai and French Quarter, and hummus instead of pizza sauce in the Mediterranian. Somehow, they manage to make it work every time, no matter how weird it sounds."}
{"text":"iGo to BoGo!  
Crazy Deals... 3 Large Unlimited Toppings $23!

Crazy Selection... Every conceivable topping offered!

Crazy Pile On... Unlimited toppings w/o skimping!

Plus None of the Meats are pork. Either Turkey bacon/ham/pep/sausage, Chicken, Steak or Shrimp. 

Excellent quality at 5 locations we've tried, and ordered here 20+ times."}
{"text":"Handmade fresh pizza. You can really taste the difference! Price is comparable to most and it really beats out the competition for quality"}
{"text":"Pizza Bogo in Lakewood offers the best customer service hand down. Always extremely helpful and so knowledgeable about the product. The prices are really reasonable especially the twisty bread for $1! Wonderful and interesting options!"}
{"text":"Beware Pizza BOGO stopped buy 1 get 1. Worst value out there - paid $21.00 for 7 inches of pizza! Heartburn! Mgr was clueless."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!! I literally have no complaints. We ordered the Big Bang last night and to say that it was delicious and full of flavor is an understatement. The sauce had some sort of sweetness to it that really complemented the pepperoni and sausage and was not overpowering at all, just a hint. The crust (which i'm very picky about) was so fluffy. On top of that, the time between ordering and actually delivery was very minimal. It was our first time ordering after hearing so many good things about this place, and aside from the fact that they're the only place in the area (that I know of) that has porkless pepperoni/sausage etc, I WOULD DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN WITHOUT HESITATION. 

So basically what I'm saying is, don't believe the hype behind these other places. I've had some pretty horrible pizza since being in Cleveland but now that I've found bogo I won't be looking elsewhere. :)"}
{"text":"The only thing preventing me from giving Pizza BOGO 5 stars is the fact that on every day except Tuesday and Wednesday the pizza is overpriced.  Maybe I feel this way because I'm spoiled by the fact that on Tues & Weds I can pick up any Large (8 cut) pizza on the menu or a make-my-own with UNLIMITED toppings for only $6.95 (!!!), sometimes $5.00 with an extra coupon.   (The regular menu price is $20 for two larges.)  

To me, $20 for 16 slices of pizza is crazy-talk.  Especially when Little Caesars is sitting just about across the street offering $5 pepperoni pizzas for pick-up every day of the week.

However, there is no comparison in taste between Little Caesars and Pizza BOGO.  Pizza Bogo pizza is consistent, delicious and topping selection is vast - including options like (my favorite) artichoke hearts and pork-free pepperoni and sausage toppings you'd never realize were pork-free unless I told you.  Yum.   I like the option to upgrade the crust to their \"miracle crust\" which is made with extra healthy ingredients and whole grains - this crust is slightly more dense than a regular crust but it passed the test when my kids devoured a whole pizza and didn't complain one bit. 

So, to sum it up, we're Pizza BOGOers for life, as long as they keep offering the Tues-Wed deal, anyhow."}
{"text":"I've never ordered a pizza from here that I haven't been happy with. That's probably in part because I only order pizza on Tuesday nights when the pizza's are $6.95 if you pickup and pay cash (extra $1 to use a credit card). 

The pizzas have always been exactly what I ordered, and I appreciate that they always ask me to check my pizza while I'm at the counter to make sure that it's right. Normally I don't remember to do that until I get home and, really, at that point, I'm just going to eat it how it is. 

Any night other than Tuesday, and Pizza Bogo is a little too expensive for my budget. But if you're looking for gourmet pizza, this place delivers. (And has pickup!)"}
{"text":"Hands down one the best Pizza establishments in the Cleveland Heights area!!! 

Positives:

* Ton of pizza choices (gourmet or custom) and unlimited toppings included in the price when you make your own
* Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity you get
* Ingredients are top notch: from veggies to meat, everything feels and tastes fresh 
* I have tried only the regular crust and that is yum, it holds the toppings and still feels soft when you take a bite
* Friendly staff who give you suggestions (that are legit and not just so that you place your order)
* You can order online (yay when I don't want to speak to a human being)

Negatives:

* Delivery can take time during weekends so plan accordingly
* If you look at their website/Facebook, they have a lot of deals, however the Cleveland Heights location does not participate in a few of them (3 pizzas for $20)
* Pizza prices are for two pies and you can subtract $5 if you want one (they want you to order more). This is a little confusing on the website
* Their pizza sizes are smaller than the regular places you are used to (Pizza Hut, Dominos). A Large is actually a Medium, and an X Large is a Large so order a size up

I have done a take out once and delivery a bunch of times. Each and every time my pizza has been delectable to the point I are stuffed but want to eat another slice. I have tried the Bombay Pizza, French Quarter gourmet pizzas and the rest have been custom made. I have to say the chicken in the Bombay Pizza is an almost great tandoori chicken - it has the red color, slightly spicy, slightly tangy. The sauce adds to the flavor and the banana peppers are just about the right addition: everything works together. The French Quarter pizza tastes like something I have eaten in NOLA. The cajun seasoning along with the andouille sausage and pepper/onions tastes like a part of a jumbalaya. As for the custom pizzas, most of them have have been made with the spicy garlic sauce and a ton of veggies. The great thing is that even if you order all the items on the list, they know how much to put to make the pizza tasty rather than only edible. Kudos to the people assembling the stuff in the kitchen. The spicy garlic sauce is definitely one of my favorite sauces there, which is why I keep getting it. 

Overall, this is a high quality pizza place, that is open late (especially on weekends), delivers in the Cleveland Heights area and satisfies all your cravings with a simple slice of pizza. I have yet to try the Miracle crust and the Chicago style gourmet pizza. That is next on my list.... Definitely a 5 star place as in my opinion the positives far outweigh the negatives."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've yet to encounter in Cleveland! OMG this greasy delectable had the best thing ever - porkless meat. I'm talking porkless pepperoni, porkless, smoked ham, etc.! Automatic favorite because of religious observations. 
Pizza quality by itself was also above par. Crust was sturdy and the edge of it crispy. Cheese was plentiful. Toppings were plentiful. Just the right amount of sauce. Breading was the best - soft on the upper part and harder (but not dried or burnt) on the bottom.

We ordered the pepperoni and meatlovers in x-large for $26. Made in 20 min (automatic win!). Establishment is also nice. Parking available.

Can't go wrong with bogo! Their website is also super cool."}
{"text":"This isn't where you go when you want a plain pepperoni.  If you're in the mood for regular pizza, hit up your favorite chain.  But when you're in the mood for something different, check out the World specialty pizzas.  I think I have tried them all now and there wasn't a single one that wasn't good.  The Tuscan and the Milano are a couple of my personal favorites.  Almost invariably when I tell someone about it, I get a story about their favorite pizza place and why it's the best and why they only order from blah blah blah.  Then I make them try a BOGO pizza and they are instantly won over, and I get the \"damn, that's good!\" look that can only be properly delivered while your mouth is completely full of something delicious.  However, the World pizzas are a little pricy.  Your best bet is to get picked up on Tuesday or Wednesday to take advantage of the buy-one-get-one-half-off deal which nets you two World pizzas for $15."}
{"text":"\"Lost\" is perhaps the first word that comes to mind when I first stopped at pizzaBOGO. It's a tiny, out-of-place storefront made stranger looking at night. Inside, I wasn't sure whether I was in the lobby of a dentist's office or there to place an order for pizza. And surprise - it was the latter!

BOGO is a serious deal on pizza, especially when it's at 11pm. The menu options were mind-numbing after a day of studying, but somehow we converged on making our own vegetarian pizza and BBQ chicken. The employees were super peppy and kind despite what must have been the tail-end of their shift. They gave us all the time we needed while we were in crisis mode deciding on the pizzas, and tolerated our half-asleep lounging on the couches while we waited for the pizzas. Thank goodness we were the only customers there, because we LOUNGED like the sofas were the last beds in the world. I suppose if you really wanted to, you could \"eat-in\" on the couches, but I assure you it won't make that much of a difference. 

About 15-20 minutes later, we were walking briskly back to the car with two piping hot boxes in our hands. The smell alone filling the car was nearly enough for me to sneakily start eating the pizzas in the backseat, but they were still delicious at our destination 15 minutes away. Two pizzas were satisfying for three hungry students, and they didn't feel overly greasy with each additional slice. I wasn't expecting the pizza to be so fresh from a random take-out only place, but pizzaBOGO is definitely one of the better pizza places around. The prices are reasonable as well, and come winter I'm sure I'll be taking advantage of the delivery options."}
{"text":"Awesome wings.  Crazy-fast delivery.
Pizza is better than most around here."}
{"text":"Great deals in the middle of the week and weekend. Unique toppings. Order is usually ready pretty fast. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"Pizza Bogo is a great fresh pizza kitchen in the city! most of the ingredients are local and fresh cut daily.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. They accommodate allergies and can give you detailed information on their cooking practices and kitchen. Love this place! Tuesday and Wednesday are pizza discount day after 3p for as many toppings as you like, so go bananas! Unfortunately, bananas are not a topping option but banana peppers are so you're in luck! Enjoy to your hearts delight! The Cleveland Heights location is best! Lakewood will not give you the Tues&Wens deal and their attitudes are a tad less friendly. Go out of your to come to the Cleveland Heights location! #ItsWorthIt"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious pizza that's full of flavor.  We had the Bombay and Napa Valley pizzas.   Best pizza I've ever had!!  Try one of the gourmet specialty pizzas.  I can't wait to try them all.  

They offer $6.99 large pizzas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  But beware because if you go in to order, there's a lengthy wait time.  Best to call ahead."}
{"text":"Any pizza place that can get me to eat a vegan pizza and then proclaim that it's the best piece of pie I've had in months? It's gotta be good. I just wish one was closer to me.

It seriously had no cheese--and I effing love cheese.

Beyond that amazement, they have a multigrain crust with flax seed. You heard me, healthy flax seed crust that's on the thin side and a bit crunchy. Load that bad boy up with their delicious sauce and tons of veggies? You wouldn't believe how good it was.

Now I love the idea of vegetable 'zza but too often it's too soagy from the moisture. I don't know how Pizza Bogo does it, but their crust is still crunchy. Nom!

Some downsides? Location, no delivery and no sit down. It's only to-go. But it's so tasty I think I'll come up with some reasons to visit again."}
{"text":"Wow! The best pizza I've ever had and I'm from Chicago, home of the best pizzas in the world. It's strictly a take-out or delivery place and no place to sit other than a few chairs and sofas for people who don't call ahead. I would recommend that you go for your own creative ideas and the unlimited toppings that suits your fancy. Definitely will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Just meh. The Tue and Wed deal is surprising to find these days, but every pizza they have does not taste fresh and gives me and my gf horrendous gas... I'm guessing due to a ton of preservatives. I wouldn't recommend it unless you only eat bargain deals at restaurants."}
{"text":"AWESOME pizza. Seriously. This is the best delivery you can order in Cleveland - delicious, Neopolitan-esque crust with a wide variety of toppings and fresh-ass tomato sauce. Mohammed from the Cedar location delivered my pizza and he was super accommodating. This will be my new go-to pizza spot."}
{"text":"Decent pizza for the price. And I mean who doesn't like BOGO???? (I'll wait)
I love the pizza special on Tuesday. I believe all pizza is 7 bucks!"}
{"text":"Thank you for taking my order Pizza BoGo! Called Tasty's at 9:20pm on a Monday and they couldn't give me a breakdown or quick review of what was available. 

Found what I wanted at Tasty's, but calling back in 3 mins, no pickup. Then call goes to fax machine. So Happy you guys were nearby!

So i'm going for the Bombay Pizza + the Milano with sausage, Peperoni + bacon. $22.
Tku again & keep rocking the value!

You milwaukee connection :)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I highly recommend the BBQ Chicken pizza. I'm the first to admit, though, that their standard pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, etc.) aren't nearly as good as other places. BUT their specialty pizzas (Milano, BBQ Chicken, etc) are amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Creative and well thought out. I love the Tuesday and Wednesday special one large 8 piece pizza (enough to fill two) for $5.95 (they raised the prise recently). Just pay in cash and call a hour in advance. The only down side on the specials day is that it's hard to find parking and their \"parking lot\" is basically a deserted construction site. My favorite is the tuscan :)"}
{"text":"This is pretty much my favorite pizza place now. I just recently moved to Cleveland Heights and I am not sure that I will order pizza from anywhere else.

I have only ever ordered for delivery so I cannot comments on their location or seating."}
{"text":"Great pizza and even better prices. Every Tuesday, Wednesday& Thursday large pizza w unlimited toppings is $6.99"}
{"text":"Ordered a XL pizza. Pizza was good. It was better then a chain pizza place. Real ingredients goes a long way. But there wasn't anything too special about it. The thing I was bothered by was the size of the so called \"extra large\". It was about the size I would expect a large to be. For $17 dollars I just feel it was too small. So overall not bad food. Portions may be slim."}
{"text":"Took an hour and 20 minutes to get a cold disgusting pizza... They used to be so good..."}
{"text":"Ok, this place wins my vote for the BEST pizza in the Heights!  Nice selection of options or you can build your own.  Gluten free crust is available.  Delivery is usually very timely, and pickup is easy.  All toppings are very fresh, not processed tasting.  The Cajun pizza with andoullie sausage and shrimp is awesome!  Will keep on ordering from here!"}
{"text":"Pizza is alright, it's nothing special. I ordered a medium 8 slice sausage pizza. The sausage was put on sparingly along with the green pepper. I can't believe they charge $13 for that size. I would give it 3 stars but for the fact that I was visiting an apartment and the driver made it quite clear that they do not deliver to apartment doors and you have to meet them downstairs was a complete turnoff, yet I was still charged a delivery fee. Hence I didn't give him a tip. I highly doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Pizza Bogo.. WHAT?! How come I have never heard of this place?
If you've ever read my reviews on Pizza Orgasmica out in San Fran California, I'd say.. Pizza Bogo is an equivalent pizza store like that... except Cleveland version. 

I ordered a large size pizza with 1/2 tuscan fiorentina and 1/2 chicago stuffed (without the top crust since they couldn't make 1/2 no top crust and 1/2 top crust). Anyways, it was delicccccious! The splash of balsamic on the pizza made it so good! As a normal 2-pc pizza fills me up, I ate 3 pcs!!! :D. Their pizza is soooo good and so different than your normal domino's and pizza hut pizza. The crust is really good, the toppings are awesome, the choices are amazing and the level of creativity is high!

However, it didn't receive 5-stars for me because I did have two complaints:
(1) You are not allowed to order 1/2-1/2 pizza IF the two pizza didn't have the same sauce. With that said, if you wanted to try their \"world gourmet\" pizza, the only two you can get on 1 pizza is pretty much what I ordered- possibly there's another choice.

(2) The \"large\" pizza wasn't that large. I was easily able to eat 3 pieces when usually 2 fills me up. My boyfriend and I split a large and we left 2 slices for his lunch the next day (more like 2/3 of his lunch). 

Also, FYI, this shop is an pickup only place. No delivery and no sit down. And after we ordered, there was an hour of 'make time' before we could pick it up. Just saying as an FYI for people who are reading this review..not a complaint!"}
{"text":"5$ large unlimited toppings tue and wed! Tasty goodness! Check em out..."}
{"text":"Seriously? $13 for a medium Pizza Hut-style cheese pizza?! What do these guys think they're trying to pull? Yes, the pizza is edible, and yea, it will make you reek of greasy cheese...:but $13. Definitely not worth it. Take your money down the road to Marrota's if you want real gourmet pizza at a decent price."}
{"text":"Very good pie, coupons and unlimted topings make this a super good value. I get the miracle dough with a slew of toppings. I then freeze what I can not finish. It heats up in the oven really well. Almost as good as when purchased."}
{"text":"The price may start higher, but all extra toppings are free!!!!
The best place to get a whole wheat pizza done right and delious!"}
{"text":"I live in Westlake, OH and have plenty of pizza places to choose from but none better Pizza BOGO. I drive the 15 minutes to have a better pizza than any pizza near me. All fresh with fresh ingredients. The owner is a great guy and remembers me every time I go in."}
{"text":"We order from here all of the time and it seems that it's always different. 

We usually always get the same thing. (I know, we're boring) but, we usually go with 2 large pizzas. One is the deep dish and the other is the curry pizza.
Depending on who's working, it's a good pizza.

It's weird! We've gotten pizzas that weren't fully cooked, soggy crust and we've also gotten pizzas that were over cooked with burnt crust.
We'll probably continue to order, because pizzabogo is our go to delivery. 
However, the last few times haven't been good. 
I'm a sicker for deep dish pizza. When it's good it's good. When it's not, it's kind of a waste."}
{"text":"Umm - its ok for pizza. They do have good pricing and great deals. They also deliver which is a plus, since there are a few yummy pizza places near by that do not deliver. 

Some of the combos are interesting, but a little too CPK-ish for my liking. I usually end up in the \"build your own\" section. I was not wow-ed by the miracle crust either. 

All in all, if I am really too lazy to drive to the better place down the street, then this delivery is \"a-ok\"."}
{"text":"Those five stars sum it up! Who doesn't love this place? Great food, always in and out, with awesome service. Oh and the specials, gotta love those Tuesday Wednesday specials, especially when you're on a budget. Carryout only so go home and enjoy! tip"}
{"text":"This is one of the finest pizza places in Cleveland! I love the Bombay pizza. Its delicious and amazing. 
The Bogo deals are pretty good, especially the Tuesday and Wednesday nights. If you haven't tried it yet, you should definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"So I don't eat pork. I love this location - no pork in any of their meat, unlimited toppings, and the miracle crust... so good. This is our third time and the quality is always good. Note - Tuesdays and Wednesdays are cash only because of their $7 large any topping pizza."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have EVER had in my whole entire life! So expensive for a s*** pizza it's even worse than Pizza Hut! 
Never order from them!"}
{"text":"What's a better meal while watch the World Cup than a delicious pizza delivered to your door?!

Really enjoyed the pizza, delicious. I got a custom made small pizza, which was pretty good size and I couldn't finish it by myself. Delivery was quick. Only disappointment was the lack of beverage selections. No bottled water? Come on."}
{"text":"We were visiting w my daughters ice hockey team from DC. Had to fit dinner in at the hotel for  girls and parents. Asked front desk staff person where she would order pizza for HER family and she recommended BOGO - we are do happy she did! Fed all of us with catering special including 10 pizzas(ANY TOPPINGS!) , fresh greens salad, 6 liter bottles of soda and paper goods for about $7pp WITH delivery tip!
DELICIOUS pizza! Best many of us have had! And got call back from Bogo manager making sure all went well - EXCELLENT service excellent food - we will definitely order next time we come into Cleveland"}
{"text":"The special that I was previously so excited about is no longer special. Large pizza on Tuesday and Wednesday went from $5.00 a couple of years go, then up to $5.50, then $5.95, now up to $6.95. So the special is not so special now. I think my love affair with Pizza Bogo is over. It was great while it lasted. Sigh."}
{"text":"Pizza is always yummy.  I tend to gravitate towards plain pepperoni pizzas and I wasn't disappointed.  I also love their cheese sticks.  They are so great.  Also, you get a free pizza with every pizza you order.  Great DEAL!"}
{"text":"This pizza seriously reminds me of Pizza Hut.  I thought it while I was eating it, and then when I brought extras to work the next day, my coworkers were all \"who got Pizza Hut!?\"  It has that nostalgic taste, that buttery pan-crust, that takes you back to your childhood of ordering from chain pizza restaurants.  

I didn't pay for it, but apparently it's extremely cheap.  And thus - really popular!  We stopped in on a Tuesday night, and I believe it was $6 for unlimited toppings on a \"large pizza\" which is really a smallish medium pizza at any other place, but whatever.  They can call it what they like.  There was a LONG line of people waiting to pick up their order, so clearly Pizza Bogo has hit a niche with the public.

It was good - tasty, crispy crust, decent toppings, but it's not worth freaking out over.  \"Best Gourmet Pizza in America?\"  Furreal?  Says who?  I've had way better pizza, all over the country, but I will admit for the price and the convenience (and the nostalgic Pizza Hut esque taste), it's a good deal.  I'd say it's good for the days when you just want to get a couple of boxes of good pizza to eat during a game or something."}
{"text":"I love this place. We have never had a bad pizza here. Like it says 2 for 1. Ingredients always fresh and choices excellent , they are always running specials. We eat the at least 3 times a month.   I recommend getting on their text message alerts to get the weekly specials right to your phone."}
{"text":"The pricing is confusing to me. For my taste there was an overuse of 'balsamic glaze' but a nice selection of specialty pizzas. In the pizza category there is just too much competition for this place to be at the top of my list..."}
{"text":"I had to re-write my original, favorable PIZZA BOGO review, in order to reflect how I feel about this place now, in light of some new info.  We have been monthly BOGO customers for years (since they opened), stopping by the store to pick up our pizza on the way home from work.   We just tried online ordering for the first time, and were shocked to read that BOGO charges a $5.50 'delivery charge' (according to their website as of January 2015)!  Of course, this is on top of a driver's tip to begin with (driver's tip is fine, and expected)!  This is shameful, and a RIPOFF!  The drivers are already making tip money, so why gouge your customers with an exorbitant delivery fee?!  Other pizza chains charge, at most, maybe 2 dollars if they have a delivery charge at all.  You just lost us as customers!  Bunch of greedy idiots!"}
{"text":"AWESOME PIZZA! The Milano is SO O O O O O GOOD!  I get it with the creamy garlic sauce - SO GOOD! only $6.95 on Tuesday and Wednesday!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! They have LOTs of fancy flavors (curry chicken, etc.) they are endless! Best thing best, large pizza is only $7 on Wed night! say what!?

They also deliver - our school has in fact ordered pizza from them for many events and our students loved it!

A little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza!  I was surprised.  If you order on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, you can get really good deals.  The only catch is that you have to pick the pizzas up at their location.  We have a small baby, so delivery is my choice.  I paid a little more, but it was worth it.  

Their delivery lady was professionally dressed in a Bogo branded coat and was really nice and professional, not shady."}
{"text":"Ordered a large sausage and pepperoni pizza from these guys with a side of wings. I would place this pizza on the same level as Pizza Hut. It was basic pizza. Nothing spectacular about it. I may order from them again just to check the consistency of this place because it's obviously really popular but my first impression didn't leave a lasting one. 

The wings were not good to me. I ate one and couldn't bring myself to eat more. Hard to understand how you drop the ball on wings but *Shrugs*. Maybe I, unfortunately, received a bad batch. Doubt if I would order them again. 

They delivered our food and were timely so that was a plus. Overall, I may give this place another shot but not in the near future. I am on a mission to find Chicago-style pizza here in Cleveland if it's the last thing I do! No luck with Pizza BOGO however."}
{"text":"Pizza Bogo is legit! Their gourmet pizzas are delicious. I only go here for BOGO nights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, otherwise it might be kind of pricey. My favorite pies are the Hawaiian and the Florentina. I prefer the thin crust as well, but I've enjoyed everything I've had. The employees are always pleasant, and they are on top of their game."}
{"text":"The name turned me off from the jump. I decided to give the place a try anyhow. Bogo is just kind of silly as far as words and acronyms go. It is really hard for me to consider this food pizza because the toppings and combinations are pretty crazy. I tried the napa valley and tuscan. I was pleasantly surprised. My friend showed me that Pizza Orgasm in SF and I figured I will try this on the strength of that. For around $6 a pizza on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, you cannot go wrong. They encourage you to open the box and inspect the product before leaving. A stoner customer at the counter refused to do so and proclaimed that he was stoned and would eat anything they gave him. I am going to try a bunch of the food here."}
{"text":"I wouldn't believe it when my family would constantly rave about how good Pizza BOGO was. I still didn't believe it when I was house-sitting in North Olmsted and had a hankering for pizza. But, still...I ordered and let my doubts subside as a delivery guy brought two mouthwatering pizzas to the door.

What does Pizza BOGO have going for it? Pretty much everything you can ask for in a pizza joint. They provide options; so many options. They have everything from hummus, to feta cheese, to curry sauce. I stuck to the more traditional and ordered a BBQ pizza on thin crust and the Hawaiian on miracle crust. Both pies were packed with flavor, fresh ingredients, and the perfect crispiness of crust. Definitely splurge for the miracle crust; it has a perfect ratio of crunchiness and doughiness. A warning though to those who like their pizza greasy and authentic: this isn't it.

They have specific days where they offer deals, but I didn't think paying full price was expensive at all. $20 fed four people handsomely. I wish they had a BOGO out in my direction because it would be my go-to spot for delivery,"}
{"text":"It's hard to explain to someone how a $6 pizza might be one of the most original and tasty pizzas that they might ever have but it's true.  I wish I knew what to say to get others to just go and try it for themselves other than, \"go it's delicious\".

The Tuesday and Wednesday $6 pizza special alone makes it perfect for a mid-week pizza binge but know that you'll be facing a 60 - 90 min wait for you pick up, cash only order."}
{"text":"We hadn't ordered our favorite Miracle Crust pizza in a looong time, so because I have a sprained ankle and the Ohio State game was on, it seemed like a perfect night.  As usual, we went crazy on the toppings, since they are included, which kind of negates the healthiness of the miracle crust, but if it's free, the calories don't count, right?  

My boyfriend brought home our 30 lb pizza loaded with everything, including pepperoni, chicken sausage, asparagus, spinach, mushrooms, onions, feta cheese... and a side of garlic butter for good measure.  It was great and I think we will have leftovers for today's Saint's game."}
{"text":"Tried pizzaBOGO for the first time and loved it! Fresh ingredients and tasted really good. The prices is great for a pizza of this quality. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm the type of person that tries to order something new every time.  Pizza Bogo basically blows my mind.

I order quite a bit of catering so I've tried more pizza's than my waistline can bear...but let me tell you - they're all great.  I especially like the World Cuisines because they really are out of the box flavors.  I also appreciate that the manager Bethany is more than helpful and is always prompt with her deliveries.  I've never had a problem with timing or with orders and from the amount of times I've ordered from them, that's really impressive!  

Basically they're inexpensive pizzas with elaborate and inventive toppings.  For a franchise, it's top notch!  My only complaint is I wish it had sit-down seating because I don't live nearby and yet still want pizza Bogo!"}
{"text":"Decent and easy pizza. Service has been upgraded recently (slightly) but the overall quality of the pizza and wings hasn't really continued to impressed. 
Menus needs to expand to keep up with competitors in the areas"}
{"text":"Every time I make a return trip to my old stomping grounds on the east side, I always think, \"How am I going to work in a trip to Pizza Bogo?\" because it's simply the best pizza place in Cleveland, hands down.

The only reason this place hasn't been reviewed yet is because they do a great job of hiding themselves and being as discreet as possible. I have no idea why they insist on doing this, because this place could be one of Cleveland's most pizza place if they did a better job of advertising and promoting.

First of all, the prices are fantastic. On a regular day, it's \"buy one get one free, and a third pizza is half price\". On Tuesday\Wednesdays, it's $5.50 for whatever pizza you want. I think it's cash only on these nights too. Be prepared to wait an hour or so from when you call in because the demand is so heavy...but it's worth it, trust me. Just plan ahead. Life's not so busy that you can't plan ahead to ensure that you'll have mind-blowing pizza for dinner! (And if yours is, you probably need the culinary healing that Pizza BoGo can provide...)

The variety of pizzas they have is incredible. They have traditional pizzas with red sauce that are loaded with flavorful meats, pizzas with Indian topppings, pizzas with Asian-style toppings, and everything else in between. I've never had anything that I wouldn't get again. They don't scrimp on the toppings either! Our personal favorites are the Napa Valley, the Bangkok, and the stuffed-style pizza which is incredible. We haven't noticed any drop-off in quality on the discount days either.

There's no place at which you can eat in, so you'll have to practice delayed gratification (which is tough to do with food this good!) and wait to eat until you get to your destination. I sorta wish they had a place at which one could eat in, but if that means higher prices, I can definitely live without it. 

Pizza snobs may say that Cleveland isn't New York or Chicago and that pizza you'll get in Cleveland is nowhere near as good as pizza you'll get there. Well, unlike those two cities, you don't have to fight through traffic to get to Pizza BoGo or spend an arm and a leg to get a pie either! Besides, I've had Chicago-style pizza from Chicago, and honestly, Pizza BoGo gives it a serious run for its money. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza Bogo, although I only go on the $6.95 days because otherwise I would have to take out a loan to purchase a pizza. I am not a pork eater so the fact that all the meats are beef was a plus. I have never gotten a bad pie thus far. I even had it delivered once and it was still hot when I got it and the delivery person was the nicest!"}
{"text":"This isn't your ordinary local pizza chain! 
PizzaBOGO offers some really unique 'World Gourmet' specialty pizzas and also typical American style 'Local Favorites' specialty pizzas.  The toppings are fresh and the dough chewy and flavorful.  Toppings...so many toppings to pick from! And sauces!
Their Miracle Crust is so good! It's a long rectangular crust made from a lot of organic ingredients and it's cut into triangles...something different and healthier! (at least it sounds that way)  It costs a little more than the traditional or thin crust, which come in their normal round shape, but it's certainly worth it in my opinion!

 I don't really know too much of their history, but it looks like they're a NE Ohio pizza chain that started in Akron.  I tried it for the first time a few years back when my friend ordered us some pizzas from their Cleveland Heights store after a long day of helping him move into his new, run-down house.  I had never heard of them prior to this.  It was sofaking good! The Bombay pizza stood out to me.  Very unique and flavorful with some spice.  I don't remember what else he ordered though.  I was happy to see when they opened a store in North Olmsted about 2 years ago, since my girlfriend at the time lived close by.  

I saw on their Facebook page that they had a special for a large unlimited topping or speciatly pizza for $7.95, so I had to do it.  They typically have specials on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  Never pay full price!  Well, I ordered their Tuscan Fiorentina on Miracle Crust ($3 extra) tonight and the guy at the counter said it'd be ready in 15 minutes.  He was a nice guy. I think he was the owner.  I went back out to my car to listen to the Alan Cox Show while I waited.  My mouth was literally salivating as I sat in anticipation of this tasty morsel of dough. The pizza..was..amazing...loaded with fresh toppings and the balsamic glaze finishes it off nicely with a touch of sweetness and acidity.  It's a shame that I don't live closer, but my pizza was still warm when I got home and devoured most of it.  Actually if I lived closer, that could be bad because I'd probably gain 10 pounds a month from eating pizza every week..."}
