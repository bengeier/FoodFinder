{"text":"As a restaurant, there is only one thing you should really order at Murphy's and that is the Irish Nachos. Waffle fries covered in cheese, tomato, olives, jalape√±o, and sour cream. It's a heart attack waiting to happen so don't order it alone. But it is still delicious, especially with a beer or two (or five)."}
{"text":"This is my choice for a beer and greasy pub-grub.  This is the only place around that has 1554 on tap, so I may be partial.  The food isn't anything to fawn over but is good (and cheap) enough to wash down with a beer."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Decent beer selection.  Hasn't changed much (that I remember) from my college days 15 years ago."}
{"text":"Go there usually once every week or two for drinks with friends. Their drinks are priced reasonably and bartenders are pretty attentive. Food is generally not bad from what little I've had. Last night was a pretty bad experience though, food-wise. Ordered a cajun grilled chicken sandwich. Adding mushrooms was optional and extra so I added mushrooms. It took a while but they were moderately busy. I told the cashier at least twice please \"no onions or tomatoes.\" I received the sandwich, took a couple bites, and realized there were caramelized onions on it. I brought it to the counter and asked if I could have a new sandwich made without onions. They asked \"was it the grilled chicken?\" I replied, \"it's the cajun grilled chicken but if the regular grilled chicken is faster, that's fine too.\" They were apologetic and I munched on my fries while I waited. They called my number again when it was ready. This time there were no onions or tomatoes as requested....but it wasn't a grilled chicken or cajun chicken sandwich. It was a crispy breaded chicken sandwich. Pretty frustrating experience overall. Make sure you confirm order multiple times I guess =("}
{"text":"Murphy's Pub really is a great college bar.  It tends to have a rather diverse mix of people, isn't usually overly loud and a great value.  The drink specials are quite good and the choices on tap are plentiful.  Food is good for bar food, definitely get the Irish nachos sometime.  There really isn't anything Irish about them, but they are delicious."}
{"text":"Great bar for hanging out with colleagues. Just have to get over the employee with Ramen-like hair who kept on yelling jibberish for no apparent reason"}
{"text":"Extremely quiet and weird vibe. The food was very low quality and poorly prepared. The beer was a little flat and the bartenders were extremely slow. Pretty bad. Bunch of nerds too"}
{"text":"If you have to drink on campus and you're over 18, I guess you have to drink at Murphy's.  Bad, rude wait staff, ok bar food, and god awful teeny crowd after 7PM on pretty much any night.  I haven't been there since the addition, so I have no idea if that took care of some of the overcrowding problems.  I sincerely doubt it did anything about the disgusting sticky floors."}
{"text":"Murphy's was always my favorite bar in college, and when I returned recently it was just the same as I remember it. It's a divey atmosphere so they almost never have cover (only on Homecoming weekend and the like) and the vibe is very relaxed. Old school high top tables and wooden booths have been etched and written on until there's very little left of the original finish, but that's half the fun. They have great drink specials and amazing Irish nachos! I was feeling so nostalgic on my last visit here that I ended up coming two nights in a row. This is definitely the best bar on campus, hands down."}
{"text":"Thursday $2 any pint and they have two brothers (and dead guy) on tap? Yesssss. Also their fries are probably the best on Green St and their burgers ain't too shabby either. The only thing I can't understand is the ridiculously long line to get in after 9pm, especially after the second bar opened inside... ohwell, grad students go early :)"}
{"text":"Meh, for a college town, this is doable for drinks and bar food. Nothing special, but I'm wondering what the differences are in color for the bar tabs."}
{"text":"Can't really state how much I love this place. Hang out here a couple times a week, as it is where my group of friends have always gone here.   On weeknights the place is pretty clear--perfect for kicking a few back with some friends. You often see people bring in laptops to do work over a beer or two. It's generally quiet enough for that during the week.   On weekends it's certainly busier and louder, but not unpalatable. Music isn't absolutely blasted, you can still have a conversation with the person next to you. If you are here for food, try the Irish nachos. Absolutely brilliant."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love going to Murphy's and the Irish Nachos are awesome.  The only reason this review is 3 stars is the varying service I've received. Sometimes it's great and there aren't any problems. But if it's crowded things quickly go downhill from there.   For example, the last time I was there, I ordered Irish Nachos without bacon (because I'm vegetarian). The order (which is just fries with cheese and nacho toppings) took an hour. Once I got my order, it had bacon on it but I didn't send it back because I was so sick of waiting. Regardless to say, it definitely ruined the night to spend an hour hungry and waiting on food and then having to pick all of the bacon off."}
{"text":"When I was in college I never suggested Murphy's but always ended up there because friends worked there. Decent food, semi-cheap, good strong drinks (if you know the bartenders) and decent specials. After 12 there are definitely lines Thursday-Saturday nights, it's usually one in, one out. If you get a booth, it's a good place to chill out, play card games, indulge in some greasy-ness and hang with friends. The music is pretty loud for a laid back bar, so you will leave with a hoarse voice, but oh well. An added bonus is they have photo hunt."}
{"text":"Murphy's has always been my favorite bar on-campus and somewhere I have gone consistently as my first bar choice. It's a very chill bar but at the same time can be crazy fun with some great music and good company. The jukebox there is always a fun way to get the night going and they always have a huge selection of songs to choose from. Also, it's the place to be these days on Thursday nights, as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30-40 min wait times depending on the night. So my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm-9:30pm to avoid any lines, cause as soon as 10 o'clock rolls around, you'll be waiting a little bit to get in.  The specials are always nice, with the $7 killians on Thursday and $2 Pints for Bluemoon, how could you go wrong? Also, with the new area that opened up, the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter. Love the new space and the addition of the air-hockey table in the basement as well. In addition, the food is delicious! Best burgers and fries on campustown. The double-cheeseburger deal on Wednesdays (i think, might have to check on this) is amaziiinnnng.    Overall, this bar is chill and fun at the same time. It's not as chill as Legends (granted Legends may have more seating) but I don't think you'll get the same experience when comparing the bars."}
{"text":"Aw Murphys, this was the first place I went to when I turned 19 and could get into the bars!  Love this place, totally low-key bar where you just sit, have a few beers and talk with friends.  \"Older\" crowd here too (compared to like Kams or Clybourne - is that still there?)  They also have a juke box, I don't know how many times we loaded Madonna songs :)  On my 21st bday we stayed til close, and they said on the PA \"it's closing time, but we'll let the jukebox keep playing because it's not Madonna\"  Food is pretty good too, we'd go when the bacon cheeseburgers were on special - OMG so yummy and incredibly greasy.  They also have loaded waffle fries that are awesome."}
{"text":"The Murph!  Great atmosphere and so many memories.  Our favorite place to go for logo nights on Wednesdays and the bar we always come back to when we return to Champaign.  There's usually a mixed crowd, and the staff is friendly (unlike a lot of other bars on campus).  We are fans of the high tables by the windows - great for a group!  So maybe the fries are better at some of the other bars on campus, but I really have nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Ah, Murphys. The one place where townies, undergrads and graduate students actually mingle.  The decor is kind of dingy, but in a really endearing sort of way. All the seats have names and years carved into them, and the walls are covered in beer memorabilia. The food is pretty good for Campustown; I like the burgers and fries. They're appropriately greasy, and when on special you can't beat the price. The chicken fingers leave something to be desired but, hey, it's not perfect.  What you go to Murphys for is the beer. The draft list is surprisingly extensive, and while the selection of hard alcohol is weak (says the guy who's finished a whiskey passport at Seven Saints), the specials are fantastic (you can normally get a double of either Beam or Wild Turkey for $5 or less) and they have specialty pints for $2.50 on Thursdays. And it's not bad beer either. I normally get Fat Tire or Angry Orchard, but they even have some decent IPA's on tap (sayeth my beer snob friends).   Murphy's is often crowded, and for graduate students, there's a very real risk of running into students, but it's my favorite place in Campustown and a really good bar overall."}
{"text":"I love watching drunk freshman share the plate of Irish Nachos, absolutely hilarious.   Burgers are great, beers good enough for a campus bar. Exactly what you expect."}
{"text":"No one has a huge affinity to this place but this is where we end up most of the time.  Pros -Fairly good specials -Relatively low amount of bros -Greasy ass delicious food  Cons -Seating is terrible on the weekends after 8 -Dirty looking, but not necessarily dirty.  Overall decent place to go, gets boring quick though since its a sit down bar, but too crowded to sit down a lot of times, and then its incredibly loud and hard to hold sit down conversations.  Go there on a weeknight to get the optimal experience."}
{"text":"Great Service this morning and my Aunt left her wallet there and they kept it all safe, cash and all till we realized it was MIA and picked it up! Thanks Murphys!"}
{"text":"Out of the bars on campus, I'd have to say Murphy's is higher up on the list as they're a good place to stop by day or night.    During the day, you can come here and they have these kickass big, savory, juicy burgers (a different burger and fries special each day) that are really yummy and filling so if you haven't already, try making it out here at least once for lunch.  You go in and order at the bar, and then walk to the back where they prepare your order to pick it up.  There's usually no cover here at night (with the exception of special occasions such as Unofficial, Mom's/Dad's weekend, etc.) and have good, knowledgeable bartenders.  There's a wide selection of beers - over 25 I believe? - and they make a kickass Amaretto Sour (my fav next to Irish Car Bombs, btw, so you should buy me one if you see me out at the bars ever ^__~, they're like a Starburst in a glass!).  Like all the other bars, this place gets quite crowded on weekends and as everyone else here has commented on, the jukebox is loud and, at $1 a song, gets heavy use/abuse.  Some of the stuff that comes out of that thing... I don't know, man... =P  The specials here are also pretty sweet - yay for logo glass night.  Overall, it's just a great campus bar to frequent anytime."}
{"text":"Two ratings, from the perspective of a grad student: Week nights: Three stars. Good prices and decent (for a campus bar) food. Weekends: One star. Full of undergrads, stay away. I only come here for office happy hours during the week, since it is close."}
{"text":"One of the best bars in campustown.... until friday and saturday nights.  Most of the time its pretty relaxed and quiet. They have decent burgers and a fair selection of beers. Its close to anything on campus, so if you need a pint to commemorate the end of a project or test - its the place to go.  That said, they make their money on all the younger students going out partying on weekends.  I head to downtown champaign for the weekends."}
{"text":"Ah, Murphy's. Yes, it's dark. Yes, there's one shade of wood throughout 90% of the bar. Yes, everything is covered in graffiti and old beer. And yes, it makes for a fun atmosphere.   I'm looking at this pub through a tint of great memories, admittedly. I did, however, visit again this past February and can say that it remains the same. The beer specials are still great. The food is still ordered and picked up the same way. I can't say much about the food as I didn't ever have much, but Murphy's wasn't about the food to me. It was beer and long talks with friends and the occasional awkward run-in with my students. It was all good and nothing much has changed."}
{"text":"I have come here countless times over a 20-year span, from when it was a little campus bar to its current ever-expanding state.  Can't beat Wednesday night - Bacon Mega Cheeseburger special night.  Usually good fries, and the standard drinks.  A campus tradition, with all kinds of stuff carved into the booths.  You can't graduate from UI without having gone there at least once, preferably more."}
{"text":"Wow, it's still here!  My husband bartended here 20 years ago, and yes they had long lines  back then too.  Happy to see it's still around."}
{"text":"If you were to add up the amount of time I spent at Murphy's in college, it would probably be close to the total time I spent in class.  Even today, this haunt is still our campus favorite when down in CU for a football/basketball/hockey game.    Back in my day, they didn't have the new addition but having the additional space makes it much easier to get a table and some space to move around without affecting the divey-campus bar feel.  Wednesday is Logo Glass Night, and I have several boxes of the great glasses I accumulated over the years.  Their beers on tap is great, especially for a campus bar.  The food is pretty good pub grub, but I believe there is a \"game-day menu\" where only certain things are served, which is kind of a bummer if you want Irish nachos on game-day because it's not on the menu.  The jukebox is great (every fricking song by The Black Keys can be found on there) and there are loads of flat screens to catch whatever game is on.  If you get there early, you won't even have to pay a cover."}
{"text":"Murphy's is the dive bar that we all kind of grew up on. Sitting right in the middle of campustown, it's a hard place to miss, whether it's the big-on-wood exterior, the fantastically long lines to get in every Thurs/Fri/Sat night, or the plentiful logo mugs the average Illini will obtain, it's just the place to be.  Few places outside of college campuses will you find $1 pints, or $3 you-call-its, $4 pitchers. Much lower key than Legends, Murphy's has the unique feel of being open to anyone willing to take a step out of their dorm rooms  You can't call your bar-hop night a barcrawl if you don't stop here. The food is good, the drinks cheap, and the people are always merry in Murphy's. I will miss every night I've remembered, or forgotten here."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty. We sat at a table by the bar and the bartender said we have no servers so you have to order here. We looked at the menu and standard bar food nothing different than others. Being Saturday and plenty of college games on but just not happening here. Most likely a lively place later and could be decent to hang. Just did not work this time."}
{"text":"I go to Murphys often and I usually enjoy the nice atmosphere However, tonight I was truly disappointed since some of my friend got food and their chicken was LITERALLY raw; the chicken tenders were absolutely pink inside. It was not only really disgusting but also dangerous for them to not notice how well their meat is cooked. They did replace the order without any objections but I still thought it was unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is the best bar on Green Street. I know that's not saying much, but let me explain. The drinks are cheap and really strong. The music is ok, there's an internet jukebox in the corner - so it's generally a crapshoot. The staff is very accommodating and courteous. The patrons tend to be less pretentious than other green street bars and are just there to have a good time drinking.   There is no dress code, but anything more than a polo shirt would be over-dressed for guys."}
{"text":"With its scarred wood tables, friendly staff, blaring sports games, and dim lighting, Murphy's is a local institution.  It's also where history graduate students tend to congregate once a week, huzzah.  The beer/food specials are generally fantastic, and the grimy feel of the bar is palatable after a drink or two.  One caveat: they have the nastiest--nastiest bathroom.  It's hideous.  Ugh."}
{"text":"As my favorite place to drink in Champaign, Murphys has to get 5 stars.   The food at Murphys is solid. Not fantastic but solid and you gotta get the Irish Nachos to split with a few friends. The food can take a while to come out, especially if they're busy, so just be patient.   The best nights at Murphy's are Wednesdays and Thursdays. Wednesday is logo night so you can grab a pint and keep the glass for under $5 and refills are only $2.50 I think. Phenomenal deal. My cabinets are full of awesome logo glasses thanks to Murphy's.  Thursdays are phenomenal because it's $2 pints. Any pint for just $2. You'll never beat that. I hear they may have upped it to $2.50 but that's a good variety of decent quality pints for just $2.50. Go out with a $10 bill and you'll have an awesome night. That simple, that's all you need."}
{"text":"This guy is discriminatory against people in wheelchairs. When I asked for a drink and said \"excuse me\" he said \"your excused\" and walked away. Literally the definition of a terrible human. I would never wish negative energy upon anyone but this man is scum. Dirt. Should be fired. Hate this place bc of Jacob."}
{"text":"It's a pub when you're looking for a pub, not a bar. And that's a good thing. Murphy's keeps things simple, cheap and fun. This is always a good place to have a beer after a long day working, and just enjoy the casual feel."}
{"text":"I was tempted to give this bar more stars considering it is the default bar for extremely casual affairs. They have pretty good drink specials and occasionally have good giveaways like Octoberfest, Winterfest, and St. Patrick's Day mugs. The tables are all carved by patrons trying to leave their mark on Green Street. Irish nachos come in huge servings. It's all good, but not really outstanding. I also feel like this place goes through an identity crisis with its loud blaring music that can shift from club music to country music (electronic jukebox-style). Don't come here if you expect to watch a sports event of some sort, but if you're looking for a place to drink and only drink, Murphy's will do."}
{"text":"As far as campus bars go, this is as good as it gets. A great place to gather with a small group of friends and drink some beer."}
{"text":"Very good bar, and an institution at the U of I.  They've expanded so now there's more room to groove. Great-tasting burgers.  A bit on the small side, but if you get them as a special, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went there with some friends we ordered 10 burgers and 3 Irish nachos to go, the person working at the kitchen at the moment told us they do not do orders to go.   Terrible costumer service management don't really care at all."}
{"text":"Ohhhh the murphyburger, how I loved thee.  Best damn burger in town.  The mushroom cheeseburger was my favorite, and the fries - oh. so. good.  Extra pickles, please.  I went back to campus a few years ago and found they had expanded - it's a little disconcerting, but at least the food is still the same.  Go Murphy's!"}
{"text":"Great reputation on campus, but not the most comfortable bar. Good deals. A bit crowded. still a good memory of being where my first legal US drink was. Great owner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have a beer in Champaign.  Usually good drink specials and a good juke box.  Irish Nachos are a must if you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Best campus bar. Food can actually be quite good, especially the Kobe burger. The crispy, but greasy, fries have slowly grown on me. The beer selection is way better than any other bar on campus. They now have some Rogue ales, which are fantastic.   Bar is homely, but at least it doesn't have a disease festering feel like certain other campus bars. Becomes increasingly less acceptable during weekends to the point where it actually is unsanitary and you can't hear anyone talking over the noise. The Jukebox churns out more and more horrifying music as people become intoxicated.    If you go here stick with weekdays. On weekdays it's actually a pretty nice place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"This is usually where I'm at if I go out to the bars, it seems to have the least amount of crappy people (you know what I'm talking about if you've been to any big state \"party school\") and not too expensive drinks. Can get very very crowded and absolutely NOTHING Irish about it. Irish nachos seemed to be waffle fries with nachos topping on them, what the fuck like?  However, they were delicious. Their burgers made me real sick once but I got over it. If I'm going to a campus bar, Murphy's is my first choice. Plus they have lots of seating for us lazies."}
{"text":"Oh man, this is a classic college dive bar.  Arcade machines, Pool tables, Dirty bathrooms, Picnic style tables....and $2 beers.  I was here on business and decided to stop in for a drink.  I came in on a Thursday so perhaps it was a special day, but all their drafts (And they had a surprisingly good list for a college bar) were $2.  What a deal!  A few people in the group ordered food and said it wasn't bad.  I cannot vouch or review the food as I did not partake.  From seeing the burgers, they looked pretty decent actually.  The process of ordering food was interesting.  There are no servers.  You go up to the food window, put in your order and give a name.  They then call your name over a PA system to the whole bar.  The speakers from this PA system sound like they came from the 70s when all you hear is squelching noise.  We pretty much looked over at the food window to see if it was us anytime the garbled noise came over the speakers.  All in all this place is a dive.  If you want this type of thing, go for it!  If you want something a bit more upscale with servers and non-bar food, try somewhere else.  Personally, I'll be back for the cheap beers next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Its basically the \"How I met Your Mother Bar\" A place where you go to sit, talk, and have a beer. Good Irish Stout. Super-Hipster-Artsy. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the better bars on campus. Great food during the day, good drink specials. More casual than some of the other Green St. bars."}
{"text":"I worked here about three hundred years ago, and I thought it was the greatest bar ever at the time. However, it is not. However, it is still better than just about every other bar on campus, circa 2002. The burgers are phenemonal, as is the BBQ chicken."}
{"text":"Just had a pretty terrible experience....walked in as i have enjoyed a pint and some food there over the years. Bar tender ignores me as i walk in. My last time had a good steak sandwich...walked around the bar...no one in line...and take a seat. Bartender comes up and says what you want. I ask for beer specials knowing i like brown ales. Red ales. Coors and budweiser...he keeps pointing to the front ..trying to get me to stand up again. He refuses to say anything else or offer a food menu..then a group of 5 people come in and he ditches me asap...thebfirst guy asks what the specials are....if this was my business i would fire that employee or send him home for service like that.  Ill stick to blind pig and other real customer service experiences."}
{"text":"My favorite C-U bar.  Nice place - on campus, but without a heavy Illini feel.  I first started going because I was underage and they didn't card way back when, but kept going after I was legal because it's a good spot to eat and talk.  They cook excellent burgers and fries, and the teriyaki chicken sandwich is divine.  Many beers on tap and knowledgable bartenders."}
{"text":"Date of Original Review: 09/11/2014 *Based off of visits from August 2012 - May 2014  Murphy's Pub is an awesome place to be any day or night of the week. The food and drink selections are great and fairly priced. The pub has several billiards tables, a jukebox, and a small outdoor smoking area with several tables and chairs. One of the greatest things about Murphy's Pub, other than the lively, fun and friendly bartenders, is that it offers several fun weekly events such as free bingo and trivia for prizes."}
{"text":"Nice bar to grab food and a beer at. Service from bartenders is mediocre. Atmosphere is Irish-feeling but feels kinda meh"}
{"text":"This is the best bar on campus. If you're looking to have a conversation with friends and/or potential dates, Murphy's is for you.   The bartenders are friendly, the food is always made to order, and the pub is the  cleanest on campus."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Disgusting and not aesthetically pleasing. Lots of vandalized light wood. It smells like dick cheese in here mixed with vomit and under dried towels. I do not understand how this bar continues to exist.  Drinks: I'm 75% sure they use Sprite-type drink in their gin and tonic. They use gigantic glasses of mixer with a single standard shot. We also ordered shots separately and each shot was $2 for 0.5 fl oz. I was stunned. I have not really ventured to campus bars in my three-and-a-half years here because I consistently have bad experiences. 0.5 fl oz for a shot is the next level of low. Most campus bars at least pretend to not be totally lost and call 1 oz a shot... But 0.5 just leaves me speechless. Standard shot, you guys, is 1.5 fl oz. Nowhere else have I seen a recipe for mixed drink with an 8 to 1.5 mixer to liquor ratio. That's basically spiked Sprite. My point is, they have -1000 drink craftsmanship. Which is fine since apparently you're supposed to lower your standards on campus. But what really gets me is that they sell 0.5 oz dribbles of liquor and call it a shot...   Food: Food service is poor though the food is fairly good. We waited an unusually long time for two burgers. We began to think something was wrong so we peeked into the kitchen (after asking a server and having to wait more) and it looked like the cook was cooking away... And then he ate the food. I get it... If I were working all night I'd get hungry too. But it's kind of strange delaying orders for an absurdly long time so that the cook can prepare and eat food from scratch."}
{"text":"The manager, Jacob (I think that's his name), is very unprofessional & rude. We had a large group with several people in wheelchairs & went up to the bar to ask if they could open the side room for us because there wasn't enough room. Jacob assumed we were trying to cut everyone ordering drinks in line & wouldn't even be mature enough to look at us. He continued to ignore us & other workers even came up to us later & apologized on his behalf. If you hate your job that much, then quit."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with 11 friends - maybe the worst meal we've ever had. Food was cold. Almost broke a tooth on a French Fry. No table service. Place was dirty. Do you get the idea it was bad? Skip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist."}
{"text":"A bar I spend a lot of time at.  There is a great selection of beers, with 25 on draft plus a selection of bottles.  There are the normal ones, but then more interesting drafts such as Bells, Warsteiner, Spaten, Summit, etc.  The burgers are great, but the fries vary in quality-- when they're good, they're really good... but othertimes not so much.  There is soup and chili in the winter, and the Irish Nachos are a U of I staple.    Usually is busy Wednesday thru Saturday, with Thursday being the best specials ($2 Import drafts and bottles, $2 Bacardi Singles, $4 Jim/Svedka Doubles, $6.75 Killians & Honey Brown pitchers).  If you want a table on those nights, you need to get their early. Sometimes the jukebox leads to very questionable music."}
{"text":"This is a great place to just chill whether it with friends or if you just failed an exam and you need a drank lol. They have great drink deals and good food too. I recommend trying the Irish nachos. They have different specials everyday too."}
{"text":"I've been to UIUC several times but my most recent visit there was the first time my friends and I found ourselves at Murphy's. We wanted to do some bar hopping and ended up here after being at Brother's which was a nice change of scenery. It's a dark (but not dingy) Irish pub kind of place which is definitely something different than what I'm used to drinking at. Really nice if you're trying to get away from all the craziness of the typical college bars.   We sat at the bar for a bit before moving over to one of the high tops. Lots of space in this place, even on a Saturday night. Great atmosphere, and really appreciated the fact that my friends and I could have a conversation without having to scream over everyone. Bar tenders were super cool and friendly. Awesome service and good prices for whatever domestics were on tap.   I can't attest to the food since we came strictly to drink, but maybe the next time we're back we'll try something."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar on campus.  It is a solid pub where they serve cheap and delicious beer.  The food is decent, but not that great.  That said, the specials on Tuesday and Wednesday offer a pretty good value ($5 for 1/2 lb burger + fries).  What could really improve this place is better music.  The jukebox is too susceptible to people with bad music tastes.  Also, the tables can be kind of sticky, but thats par with the course."}
{"text":"Five stars is probably due to some heavy nostalgia sentiment for me. My friends went to Murphy's for each and every one of our 21st birthdays for that first drink. Always had a great time. Beyond that, they have delicious burgers and fries. And it's a more laid back alternative to Kam's or Red Lion. Murphy's will always be a memorable place for this Illinois alum."}
{"text":"I've never visited Murphy's during prime douche time, so its rating remains high.  I hope to never see it while extremely busy, because I'm 99% sure I'd hate it.  I first went here the day after moving into town.  I was undernourished and exhausted.  Plus, we had to buy lunch for our two moving helpers.  So, imagine my elation upon arriving and finding that I could get a bacon cheeseburger and fries for $5.  We bought four big ass lunches for $20.  And it was actually good!  So satisfying was my first encounter with Murphy's.  During the summer they have a great drink special every day.  You buy a mug filled with beer for $4 (or $6....damn, all that beer wiped my memory clean) and then get refills of Bells Oberon, Sam Adams and a few others for $2 all night.  Now that is a sexy drink special.    The ladies bathroom has graffiti on the ceiling that says something about being in love with LBJ.  Lyndon B. WAS a pretty man.... I guess.... :-/"}
{"text":"Murphy's is a solid bar! The burgers are good, they have plenty of beers on tap, and the Wednesday Logo Night deal ($5 for a beer and corresponding branded pint glass to keep, then $2-3 refills thereafter) is not to be missed! I have a whole cupboard full of cool glasses thanks to this place. It's also a great quiet bar to go to with your friends on the weekends if you're not in the mood for dancing."}
{"text":"good times from college, my favorite bar in the area. always go there when i'm down and always made sure to bring out of town people there when i came.   drinks will be the cheapest compared to everywhere else in the area. Food is pretty good but sometimes its hit and miss. i've had great irish nachos and i've had terrible irish nachos there.   SERVICE IS TERRIBLE they are incredibly rude.  1st example standing at the bar watching a football game holding my money out on the counter so bartender knows i want a drink. next thing i know the bartender is in my face \"waving your money around wont get you served faster\". What the hell, i was standing there holding it on the bar, i wasn't even looking at you i was watching tv.   2nd example crowded for unofficial so i'm sure they are stressed. close out my tab, paid with a credit card but was going to leave a cash tip. Still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at 50 dollar tab with no tip. \"hey buddy, thats really a jerk thing to do, thanks\" again, what the hell! can i reach in my wallet to give you the cash, needless to say i said yeah your right and left without tipping.   3rd example usually the irish nachos are covered in toppings, most recent time hardly any. go back up to counter, its sunday no one is there so its not like its busy. Can i get some more toppings please i didn't get very much. Guy looks at me like i just punched his mother. answers slowly \"yeah... i guess i can\". he was pissed. Dude calm down i just want more toppings, didn't say it was terrible, get over yourself.   thank god i love this place. except the servers. and not all are bad, just most."}
{"text":"Good times with friends and cheap beers, and that's pretty much it.  The food is not bad, but its just bar food, so u cant expect much. The Irish Nachos is good to order with two more people. The other appetizers are just ok (hmm, the spicy cheese bites are good, although small), but there's usually some food special everyday.  Because of the regular coming, you develop certain bonds with the place, even if the place is not great. If this bar was located anywhere outside Campus, I dont think I would ever go there.   However, the memories make the place and thats pretty much how Murphys survives."}
{"text":"Wow, I used to think that the Burger here was one of the best ever - not anymore.    I was in Champaign last week, on a Wednesday evening.  Murphy's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm.    I ordered a Mega Bacon Cheeseburger and fries.  Sat at the bar, and had to ask the bartender if he could please wipe off the bar in front of me because it was all messy - you would have thought I called him mother a dirty name.  Service here was terrible.  The burger?  Much smaller than I remember.  The fries, barely edible....they were like eating balsa wood that had been deep fried.    All in all, a terrible meal.  I won't be returning, not with all the other places in town now where you can get some good eats."}
{"text":"So that no one may be further misled, Murphy's can only be truly appreciated though the lens of a college student. The place caters to the average college-aged individual who is content to fraternize with his or her colleagues over inexpensive alcoholic beverages and greasy diner food. While classier than the average campus-town bar, Murphy's by no means rivals the sophistication of the surrounding bars of downtown Champaign and Urbana.   Classically, Murphy's tends to be more popular among the graduate and older undergraduate students, but that doesn't deter alumni and non-student patrons from frequenting. The beer selection outmatches any other bar on the University of Illinois campus and it is a bargain cost-wise compared to the non-campus bars. Food is typically served until 11 p.m. each night, with one of the most popular dishes being the \"Irish Nachos\" - essentially a whole plate of waffle fries decked with nacho toppings that you'll need a friend or two to finish. A host of burgers and other fried foods are also available with various specials throughout the week.    I have nothing but the fondest memories of Murphy's Pub. There's nothing ritzy about it, but if you're open to having (or reliving!) a fun yet relaxing college night, Murphy's is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Solid burger and fries for cheap. Good beer selection for campus town and reasonably priced. Overall, I like murphys. The loudspeaker announcements though are just really annoying."}
{"text":"Go Mega, it's worth it. When the fries are done right , they're some of the best in town - and FREE with any sandwich every Sunday.   The one fella has been there forever - I believe his name is Jim and he's an awful nice guy.  My only lament is the loss of truly beer battered chicken fingers sometime  around the time they expanded.  Now they're just the frozen in a bag variety and not particularly notable."}
{"text":"What a shit hole! Came here for a drink and a burger and I never made it that far. It was almost 4 in the afternoon and I sat at a pub table. My sleeve got stuck to the table. A voice came from behind the bar that said. If you want drinks or food, you have to order at the bar as there were no waitresses. I got up and grabbed a couple menu's. Looked it over and said. Let's go, I've seen enough. I will only pass thru college towns from now on!"}
{"text":"Old people on the college strip had a blast,,,we just gambled on machines,had good drinks and good service."}
{"text":"Well, it's an institution here at the U of I. You can get cheap brewskis and cheap burgers and neither are bad. It's usually crowded Thursdays so I try to keep away."}
{"text":"I LOVE Murphy's! It has a great campus bar feel. Its a perfect location for campus for in between classes. A beer for everyone here because their draft list is extensive. My bartender was helpful and super nice! Would definitely recommend anyone to come here for lunch, a game day, or any night of the week!"}
{"text":"Ok seriously, this place serves some of the best tasting Guiness on tap that I've had thus far! (And this coming from a beer lover who hits irish bars in Chicago). It's really fresh!   My college buddies and I returned to this old college hotspot to reminisce on old times. We used to come for Mug Night on Wednesdays so this place brings back great memories.It's been 8 years since I've been here, so I was really surprised when the food and beer was actually better than I remembered!    First of all, I already mentioned their beer on tap. it's quality and fresh! and low cost.   Secondly, their burgers still rock in an awesome way! I had their Turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers. Man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent. The turkey burger is well flavored and succulent.  We basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries.   Another good thing is that they also expanded this place - it used to be way too crowded but they added a whole other section to this place.   They have a nice layout with table sizes that comfortably accomodate anywhere from 4 to parties in the teens. I love their spacious bench seat tables.   If you're visiting U of I, definitely hit up this place! It's a cherished favorite."}
{"text":"**Review of food ONLY** I know many people frequent this place for drinking purposes but I am only reviewing for food.  Eh, this place was alright. I was excited to see that they had spicy cheese bites which thrilled me because growing up in Wisconsin consuming cheese curds while at the bar is a must. These were a rendition of the cheese curd but a very sub par one. The cheese inside was not hot enough so the cheese didn't squish out when eating them, it just kind of stuck to the breading. Next off, I had the burger. I ordered the mushroom burger which was the Tuesday special. When I got my burger it had no mushrooms on it and the cheese was barely melted. The topping such as the pickles, lettuce, tomato, and onion were fresh. The fries were mediocre at best. Coming in at 1:15 in the afternoon I didn't expect the place to have a big crowd but it was far too quite; No music was even playing."}
{"text":"Murphy's is a great bar to go to if you just want to chill.  I've been to a couple fun happy hours here (but how can a happy hour not be fun?) and I've had some of their deliciously fried, greasey appetizers, too.  There are plenty of booths and tables to sit and play some cards (drinking may or may not accompany said card games...)  Overall, it wouldn't be my first choice bar on the weekends, but maybe on a weekday.  The crowd is less \"Greek\", which doesn't really matter to me, but it's nice to point out."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place.  They've expanded since I went to school here, which is fantastic since the overall feel is less crowded.  The more people you can fit in the bar, the shorter the line outside!  I haven't had food here in years, but I know it's super cheap.  Drinks are cheap too, decent draft beer selection for a campus bar, and it's surprisingly not that hard to snag a table (there are a whole bunch of them).  I've had many an evening here, dancing in that space in front of the jukeboxes.  And you should know that this is not a place where a lot of people dance - it's mostly just people drinking, probably shaking their heads and laughing at my friends and I dancing around like idiots to Bon Jovi.  But you know, Murphy's just makes me feel comfortable enough to do that.  The jukebox blows on busy nights though - even if you pay extra for \"play next,\" like 10 other people already did that so you might not hear your songs at all.  And you'll probably have to sit through a lot of stupid crap that other people picked out before you get to any good music.  I guess it just depends on the crowd.  Either way, we always stop at Murphy's when we come back to Champaign and I know we always will!"}
{"text":"Tried to get food at 10:30pm.  Kitchen was closed. Sitting here at the bar for 5 minutes with an empty glass."}
{"text":"Very standard bar. Most times I've been here there has been no crowd whatsoever, and frankly seems kind of dead. Beer deals are decent and pub food is very standard. The bar is huge however, good to bring a big group."}
{"text":"Nothing really special. Its a college bar in a college town. The typical bar food, but fries come free with any sandwich on Sundays I think. I find it odd that your order from a window, and your number is called. I mean the place isn't exactly set up like Panera. Nevertheless, I was okay with my fish sandwich."}
{"text":"It's a good place if you're just looking for an Irish pub.  It has pretty good drink specials (with the exception of the weekend).. and it's bigger than most other bars on campus.  For the most part, I think it's clean except late on Friday or Saturday night.  I do like some of their food too.  Their MegaBurger and Irish Nachos are really delicious.  And Wednesday and Friday have specials for the megaburger.      The people aren't pretty/hot.. I think it's frequented more by the drinker type instead of the going out type."}
{"text":"used to go before we hit the club. Nice to have a large group and sit down and shout out conversations. I remembered thursday is like an unofficial international day. Heard they had good fries;"}
{"text":"Because I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, I consider myself part Irish. Nah, just kidding. But I have been to my share of Irish bars. I like Murphy's because it's low-key and they have good drink specials. I mean, on Thursdays you can pay 4.50 for a beer and get a glass. Then refills of said beer are only 2.50! Pretty sick. The next thing I've got to try here is the food. Also, they just opened a new part of the bar which looks really nice and opens up the space. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"nice selection of beer and they have Green Line on tap! the bartender who was there when we went was great at recommendations for all different tastes. cheap prices and a cool divey feel."}
{"text":"Cheap pub - good atmosphere and their foods are pretty decent. Employees are nice. If u want to talk with your friends, this is a great place to go to since the music isn't too loud"}
{"text":"Nobody was there, it was during the day, the bartender was incredibly rude, we asked a question about $1 burgers and she even more rudely told us to read the sign then after we ordered two burgers she charged us full price and said that the deal was only for 1/6th of a pound even though it didn't say that on the sign. I reserve the words to describe her. It's summer. Nobody's here. Don't be a B***"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place to hang out with friends on campus, but no more. We are all completely and utterly disgusted with the customer service that we received yesterday and none of us will be back until there is some sort of change.   I was sitting at a table with some friends yesterday evening and a bartender comes over and asks for everyone's IDs. Me and one other girl at the table were underage (both 20), however, neither of us were drinking. I just came for the Irish Nachos. First he starts harassing my friend and telling her that if he sees her drinking he will throw her out and call the cops and make sure that she is arrested. He continues around the table and it comes to me. I hand him my ID and he points at my friend's beer, he was sitting next to me, and asks if it was mine. I told him no, but he said he didn't believe me and told me to leave and never come back or he would have me arrested. To reiterate, neither me or my friend were drinking or doing anything wrong. Honestly, we knew that they had been cracking down on underage drinkers lately and it would be stupid to even try anything. I was just trying to enjoy a nice night with my friends before we all left for break.   I understand that it is his job to enforce the drinking laws, but I have never been spoken to in such a rude fashion in my life. We all hang out at Murphy's pretty regularly and it is honestly sad to see this establishment get ruined by such a horrible staff."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Murphy's since my late 20's, when my sister went to school at UICU. The hamburger was always excellent. I would love to travel to Campus from the Chicago burbs to eat one again."}
{"text":"We came in after our last day of exams the night before we all went home for winter break.  This was my first time in Murphy's and I've got to say it was pretty sweet for a campus bar.  It's like an Irish-style pub, lots of dark furniture and seating areas. The inside is pretty big, there's a few different rooms and even a downstairs that we didn't get a chance to check out.  We shot a few games of pool and were able to have decent conversation due to the music being at an actually reasonable volume.   They had several drink specials, I was able to get a Harp for $2.50 and McGillicudy shots were only $2 also. I'll have to come back when the Guinness is on special (if it ever is).  The only thing I wasn't too happy about was the service. It was quite slow. It seemed like they were a little understaffed. Our bartender was good once he got around to us, but perhaps the place was a little more crowded than usual?  Either way, a good time and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent drinks + chill atmosphere + Irish Nachos (oh God yes) + lack of sketchy people grinding on you = WIN."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I decided to take a spur of the moment trip to Urbana to meet our parent campus and get to know the university. It was a sunday and we wanted to catch the NFL games so, naturally, we went up to a bar. Murphy's was our 3rd choice (after the other 2 bars were either closed or not showing any games). The place was empty (not surprising coming from a college town where all they care about is Saturday Football) except for a couple of old guys talking to themselves.  They had a lot of TVs and only one game on, when we asked them to switch it they couldn't because they didn't own the football package -strike one-  Despite the place being deserted our server never took our order and we had to go up to the bar to have them take it. There is some controversy about this, as some bars will have you do that in the early evening but I've been to bars in the middle of nowhere at the same time where this wasn't the case. Either way, that was a bit annoying, so strike two.  Strike three came along when after ordering we had to pick up our own food at the kitchen. At that point we gave up on good expectations and simply sat down to watch the game.  The good news is their food is amazing. My friend and I are no fans of fries either but man they were awesome! And their bean burger was gigantic and extremely good according to my friend, while I had the steak sandwich and that was absolutely perfect.  In any case, chances are the place is legit on Saturday Game Day, but it's up to you if you want to try it out."}
{"text":"Some reviewers seem not to like ordering at the bar. Boo hoo it's not like a long walk. Classic campus bar."}
{"text":"4 stars for tradition, 2 stars for food quality and 1 for service. The female bartender that took our lunch order had ZERO personality. They make you pay up front for your food. Every time I said \"Thank-you\" to the bartender, she replied with \"No Problem\". I'm glad it wasn't a problem. I'd recommend drinking here at night, but not eating."}
{"text":"Solid pub.  Food is exactly what would you expect from this place.  Absolutely a classic for Champaign- Urbana and U of I students.  Some of the downsides include how dirty it can be, with a lot of sticky surfaces, their old school way of taking tabs that can be inconvenient, their unclear switch between being carded and not being carded, and their seating can be a bit uncomfortable.  But, for what it is?  Perfect."}
{"text":"One of the 2 best bars on campus (the other being Legend's). This place is always low key and not one of the crazy loud bars all the underclassmen go to. You can usually find a place to sit down and the tables have years of writing carved into them."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to stop in for some bar food on a Thursday night when they have their best bar specials but there's a big caveat. This place is on campus so it easily fills up with  large groups of drunken college kids during the week when school is in session. I've witnessed one of said kids puking in their cup as they attempted to take a drink. If it's a weekend, the youngins usually find plenty of parties to attend so that's less of a problem, unless its moms or dads weekend where it can fill up just as quickly. They don't even serve their regular menu on nights like this which can be frustrating if you forget about campus life from time to time. We stopped in last night during spring break for some $2.50 specialty pints and irish nachos and life was good."}
{"text":"Love this place and it will always have a special place in my heart forever being a graduate from UIUC. There still killing the Irish nachos."}
{"text":"Best local bar in town. Their food is yummy (look at Hooked often), they always have great beer prices, and they have great service! I love the environment and the laid back atmosphere that encompasses this bar. Murphy's made grad school manageable, and I couldn't thank them anymore for that."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of all the campus bars hands down.   Every Thursday night during the school year, a club I'm in takes over the basement (pool tables, darts and all) to hang out in. I can't even count all the great memories I've made there.   Unfortunately, on Friday and Saturday nights the lines build up pretty fast, so it's best to get in before it gets packed.  In terms of food/drink, great fries, great specials on drinks. ($2 Woodchuck Thursdays!)"}
{"text":"I still have dreams of Wednesday lunch.  Bacon Mega Cheeseburger and Fries for $4.  I would give my left arm for a Murphy Burger on some days."}
{"text":"Consistently our favorite C-U haunt since the 1970's!! Love it...great beer cheese soup and awesome burgers...great bar selection and bartenders!!"}
{"text":"a year later and I still loooove this place.  Got the turkey burger, yumm!  The fries has got to be the most deep fried small pieces of actual potato heaven I ever had and $3 pints of Guinness drafts."}
{"text":"They call this an Irish pub but there's nothing Irish about it in my opinion. Honestly people don't care about the atmosphere, do they? They just come for the booze. They serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends. They have a few specials too, so do check those out."}
{"text":"Great Irish Pub right in the heart of campus! This bar is almost always packed, especially if there is a good game on! The food is awesome too for bar food. They have a great chicken sandwich with french fries. Add a tastey Guiness to complete your meal!"}
{"text":"I always look for a nice pub when visiting different cities. I saw this while walking on campus and decided to check it out.... Staff not friendly or sociable... Maybe it's because Im from the south and use to hospitality ....but damn how about a smile and a conversation I WAS ONLY PERSON at the bar.. I even tried to get a convo going... I know my opinion isn't going to close the bar but as a former bartender who OWNs a company now .... Customer Service is what will make you $$$."}
{"text":"I've been on campus since 2006, and Murphy's has yet to let me down.  From drink specials ($2 Woodchucks on Thursdays? I'm in!) to great food (I'm looking at you, Irish Nachos) to the atmosphere, you can count me in as a fan. The expansion has made it much easier to walk around the bar on the weekend nights when everyone is cramming in. Finding seating is less of a rat race, but I'd still say to arrive earlyish if you don't want to be standing.  The bathrooms can get a little sketchy, but I pretty much expect that from a campus bar. The jukebox has some interesting selections, and the music is usually good overall. It's my current favorite place to go and hang out with friends while not spending loads of money at the same time."}
{"text":"Really Murphy's??? Why do you have such stars?  What I was served was a ridiculously gross, flavorless hockey puck. I ordered (this word would be in italics if we had that font option on yelp) a grilled cajun style pork tenderloin sandwich....though this was definitely not what I received...  I will never come back to this place of my own free will. Not only was the food abhorrent, the place was so dingy, dark, and grimy...not what I was looking for.  So, thanks, but no thanks Murphy's. Folks, I highly advise you to pass this place up."}
{"text":"This place just gets it. You want a preemptive or post hangover killer then the cheeseburger and fries are for you. Great beers great atmosphere. If you don't like this place then something is wrong with you. Iconic."}
{"text":"The best bar on campus. Hands down. Their food is always tempting (typical pub food) but I usually come for the the beer and friends. The location is great and the atmosphere is better than the other campus bars. My one complaint is that they lack the depth and sophistication of the selections at other bars downtown. I don't mind my Blue Moon but somedays I want something a little more interesting than the usual suspects.   If you are going to be around for awhile, learn about when the specials occur (Mug nights, half off bacon cheeseburgers, etc.). If you want to carry a casual meeting, this is a good location for lunch. The late afternoon and evening hours will be a little louder."}
{"text":"great drink specials and good food! usually crowded, but never too noisy. a great local place for those group gatherings to meet up, drink up, eat up, and get out for a night on the town!"}
{"text":"In terms of campus bars, this is definitely my favorite bar to go to, especially now that I've been out of college for a few years. Is it the best bar in Champaign-Urbana? No, probably not, but if you're in the area, this is your spot. It's super low key, super pubby feeling, and usually has a nice mix of hipsters, sports fanatics, and average joes. The beers on tap are always good and remain pretty simple. They always have specials too, which is nice. I miss this place!"}
{"text":"The minimal bare acceptable campus bar for graduate student inhabitation.  But only on weeknights.  When there are no sporting events.  And your car has run out of gas and can't get you out of campustown.  And you really need a drink because your advisor just called you to tell you you have to cancel your weekend plans to come over and shovel his sidewalk.    The leftover vomit is less tangible, the smoky haze less all-engulfing, and the number of 14 year olds skanks less overwhelming than anywhere else on campus (except firehaus, but apparently no one goes to firehaus despite the fact that it is clean, devoid of skanks, and conveniently located.)"}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere. That's what I remember. Maybe I was too buzzed. To remember."}
