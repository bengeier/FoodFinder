{"text":"I love this place!  It is located in a strip mall just west of 10 on dundas. It is a huge spot with lots of tvs and ample seating for all group sizes.   If you go here, you go for the wings. These things are gigantic and meaty! They come in 1lb and 2lb and are served with fries and veggies. I believe the cost is 11.95 and 14.95. I could be a touch on the high side so I'll update when I next visit.   The wings come in a variety of sauces from mild to insanity. Ive ran the gamut and \"hot\" suits me just fine.   They have other food here including a great and enormous plate of nachos but do yourself a favor and indulge in some wings, you'll be glad!  On weekends they have a band and have charged entrance fees before ($5) so get there before 9 if you want to avoid that. They also have karaoke some nights, which is usually good for cringe worthy entertainment."}
{"text":"So sad they are closed.  It was a bit of a dive and a local's place, but I never felt an outsider whenever I went there.  Friendly servers, the only real patio in the area, cheap Creemore and probably the best wings in the city (definitely for the price on wing night), and it was a place I'd always come back to if it had stayed around."}
{"text":"A friend turned me onto this place and although it can be hard to find (located in a strip mall, parking in read) it is turning into a regular spot to go for wings!  They have 8 flavours (mild - suicide, thai chili, honey garlic - all the favs).  You can buy by the wing or get a single meal ($9) or double ($18) which comes with  veggies and dip. The medium doesnt have much heat. The hot was \"Franks\" level hot. So if you like a good burn might want to try suicide.  We ordered fries on the side and they came in a giant basket - enough for the entire table to split or as a stand alone meal.  Great value.  The rest of the menu is typical sports bar fare - good variety and good prices.  Service is fast and friendly.  They have nightly entertainment and a ton of big screens for watching the Olympics or hockey."}
{"text":"Great bar. It's kind of tucked away, and if you aren't looking for it you'll drive right by it, but  you should keep your eyes peeled!  They have the standard pub fare and their prices are very reasonable. The wings are probably the draw for me here, but I've sampled a lot of their food and I've never been disappointed. I do love the nachos as well :)  They have events going on all the time, poker nights, UFC nights, karaoke and live bands. My band has played here a number of times and it's always a great night - no cover by the way. Free awesome live entertainment...where can you even find that anymore? This bar is huge with a great patio and feels like a friendly neighbourhood establishment. They have a couple pool tables as well. All in all, a cool hang."}
