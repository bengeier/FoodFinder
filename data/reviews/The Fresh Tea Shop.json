{"text":"I come here to study or hangout with friends. The drinks are delicious (my favourite is passion fruit and elephant Chai tea), it is a little expensive if you're willing to spend about $5 on a small drink."}
{"text":"Good place, limited choice, awesome staff, but not for those who are accustomed to traditional bubble tea places. (Too white for me and I go to Starbucks)"}
{"text":"I went here wanting to try something different and was amazed at the variety of beverages this place offers. It ranges from bubble tea, iced hot chocolate, baked goods, loose leaf teas, iced teas and more. The opportunities were endless! I had the tropical iced tea and it tasted great! They give you the option of adding extra toppings such as tapioca and fruit jellies which adds greatly to the drink. The prices are reasonable as well and there are many flavors to choose from for the iced teas. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful in choosing a drink as well. I would definitely come back again and try another flavor"}
{"text":"I have been there twice this week with my kids to enjoy a cup of bubble tea (with tapioca balls). Both times (on Monday and on Saturday) the answer was that unfortunately they ran out of tapioca. Last time and first visit I have paid for three cups of taro milk tea with tapioca about 21 dollars."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this tea shop and, unfortunately, it will be the last time I give this place my business! My first visit was very pleasant the service was a little slow but the girl who was working behind the counter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the company's products so I did not mind slow service. I brought my husband and 3 children here as we wanted to take the kids outs for some warm drinks and snacks. I had told my family what a nice spot this was and I like supporting local businesses instead of always supporting the big chains. When we arrived the place was not very busy the kids wanted hot chocolates with whipped cream and we were told they were out of whip cream and they were also out of milk. My husband ordered a cup of loose leaf  tea and the server gave him the wrong kind, the server apologized and gave him the correct tea. I ordered a small coffee and noticed as it was being wrung up it was put in as a cappuccino which was $3.50  I asked about this and the server said the cash register did not have a coffee button. I thought to myself $ 3.50 for a small coffee in a paper cup! After paying and waiting over 15 minutes for the other server to run to the store to get some milk we finally got our beverages. No apology for the wait whatsoever! I also ordered 4 cookies and when I went up to the counter to get them there was only 2 cookies on the plate the server accused me of only ordering 2 cookies and I would have to pay for the rest. Considering the wait and mistakes that were made the server could have at least offered to give us the 2 $1.50 cookies for all the screw ups as we had already spent $23.00 for 1 coffee, 1 tea, 3 hot chocolates and 2 cookies.  Common sense you would think!  All while this was going on the 2 servers were both fixated on the movie that was playing on the TV not seeming to care about the customers.  I am never one to complain about service as I too have worked in the service industry and usually I give the establishment the benefit of the doubt as I know what working with the public can be like but this place was ridiculous! I give this place another year and it will probably be another downtown Newmarket business that goes under!!! I won't return and I will spread the word!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a business meeting at The Fresh Tea Shop and I LOVED it! Beautiful pictures of local artists on the walls, fireplace, modern ambiance, friendly service, soft pleasant music... Now about tea. Big selection of hot teas! Loved my Japanese green. They also have a lot of cold tea drinks. The selection of pastry is not big but my friend had muffin and loved it. Highly recommend for tea lovers or anyone who needs a place to meet with friends."}
{"text":"Whitest bubble tea place ever.  Employees are nice but NOT recommended for experienced asian bubble tea drinkers."}
{"text":"Nice to run in and grab a drink, or to go upstairs and sit. Nice atmosphere.   I haven't tried a lot of the drink options as I've kind of fallen in love with the cranberry tea with juice pearls.  Looking forward to visiting in the summer heat for my fav drink and walking along Main Street."}
{"text":"This is like a very western style bubble tea joint. It features some normal favours such as taro, but most favours are not seen at Asian bubble tea places. They have exploding bobas which are fun to try at first but kinda make your drinks change favour towards the end. I still personally prefer Asian bubble tea, but this place is cool and fun to try out."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.... I always feel refreshed after having a nice cold beverage from here. Inside looks very neat and a nice place to just hangout."}
{"text":"Was there last night for the first time.  Great staff and very informative for a newby!!! Very friendly, welcoming and accommodating.  Love the Masala chai tea!!!!"}
{"text":"Find it pricey, 80% of the time when i visit they have run out of tapioca. Favorite is elephant chai vanilla, unique flavor but gambling on whether they have tapioca and paying about $7 for a large- its easy to pass on and go elsewhere. Customer service is ok."}
{"text":"3.5*   I came here on a whim while I was exploring historic downtown Newmarket. Wandering on Main Street, this was the last place I'd expect to see such a modern looking (bubble) tea shop! Being the boba-fiend that I am, I had to go in and try it.   First impressions - the restaurant was large and brightly lit. There was some cozy seating on the 2nd floor loft that looked pretty ideal for settling in and getting some work done. This didn't feel like the Taiwanese bubble tea shop that I came to expect, but rather a more Western version of a tea shop.   I ordered their classic milk tea without any topping (regular size was around $5 after tax). While this was a bit pricier than I expected (for reference, Chatime milk tea is $4.50 after tax) I thought that the tea flavour was pretty strong with the right amount of creaminess. I've definitely had milk tea that tasted worse for more money. Compared to other large bubble tea chains, this is comparable to Chatime, slightly better than Cocotea and definitely better than Boba Guys."}
{"text":"Spent the better part of Sunday morning at this location. A lot time and love has been put into this location to make it magical and very welcoming. Love the selection of teas and the service was excellent. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Found this nice gem when I was walking on NewMarket main street with a friend prior to our axe throwing yelp event around the area.  On a Thursday evening at around 6pm, Main Street NewMarket is VERY quiet, but because the event does not start until 7pm, we had to find a place to sit down for a bit and I am glad I found this place!  This place is pretty large, with lots of seating just up the stairs and very cozy decorations.  They serve a lot of variety of teas (cold and hot) and also regular coffee and specialty coffee such as latte.  To top it off, they also have pastries such as cakes and cookies if you want a bit too.  I ordered a Thai Green Tea Lemonade and my friend ordered the Blueberries Royal.  Both drinks were served in cold and both were delicious and refreshing for a hot summer day!  Between the two, I would prefer the lemonade more because it is not as fruity as the Blueberries Royal and if you know me, I'm old school and prefer regular teas!  This place also has chess (yes just like the elementary school days!) for their guests to enjoy and most importantly, WiFi that works with decent speed!  This is key because I was getting pretty weak receptions on main street Newmarket!  Next time I am around, I will for sure drop by and try other drinks."}
{"text":"It is a strange sight to see the transformation starting along Main Street- boarded up shops and the landscape being encroached upon by boarded up shops- the hangers on include a number of restos- and this little gem on the corner open a bit later than much on that stretch. Friendly servers who explain the process of how the tea is made, and showing the process is a bit of an added touch. The wide open space and the upper loft for the younglings to study is a throwback and a welcoming addition the the community.   While a bit on the pricing side for a steaming cup of Chai, not to mention this Elephant milky  thing for over $6,00, one can see that quite a bit of care is taken into its preparation.aube it's when we came, bit the dlswrets were a hit on the pricey side but looks like a tasty 2 biter for the cheesecake.   Really a nice option for the younger crowds and for a nice steamy cup on a cold day!?"}
{"text":"Watered down drinks to celebrate their first anniversary?  Seems that the \"half price\" deal today gets me half the flavour. Normally I need to add extra syrup for a solid flavour, but today extra syrup tasted exactly like normal syrup-very watery. Time to switch to Teavana for good. It's a shame...."}
{"text":"Ordered a maple moose chai milk tea with tapioca. It's an interesting blend of maple syrup, milk tea, and cinnamon. I found it to be an acquired taste, but it wasn't bad. I can see some people may love it and others may hate it. It's pretty sweet so I would probably lower the sugar content, if that's possible next time. The tapioca itself was sweet and chewy, which I liked! Reminds of Taiwanese tapioca.   There's seats for people to sit, study, and chat. There's a table with a chess board. A cute date place!   Would love to try their other teas should they open up a location in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is a go-to when coming down to Newmarket. The bubble tea here is amazing, they have a lot of flavours that you can mix as well as the toppings! Mango, passion fruit and tropical are super refreshing and yummy. Not to mention the staff are always sooo friendly here. There's a lot of room to sit and relax/study as well. Love love love :)"}
{"text":"I went for a walk with my son early evening and decided to stop by this shop. Wasn't sure what to order but I wanted something similar to a lemonade drink. The employee gave some recommendations and was pretty informative with the menu. Unfortunately I didn't really enjoy my drink. It was way too overpriced as well. I appreciate the customer service though. Maybe I'll give this place another try."}
{"text":"I came here after a nice meal up the street. I believe this is the only tea/coffee shop on Main Street Newmarket.   I ordered an Iced London Fog Latte with tapioca and it was pretty good, tea taste was strong and not too sweet, tapioca was nice and chewy. The staff there seem to be quite new and unfamiliar with what they were doing but they did not hesitate to fix our drinks.  We also ordered a few Americanos and they were Nespresso pods, but very fresh and fragrant.  There is plenty of seating inside the store with a wall (half full) of teas, they also sell a bunch of glassware/teaware.  My only complaint is that no sugar or milk/cream was put out and we had to ask for it; for a coffee/tea shop.. it should not come as a surprise that customers will be looking for these."}
{"text":"Opening Hiccups  I went here in August with two girlfriends. They ordered drinks only, while I ordered a sandwich and a tea. I imagine after some time this place will smooth out its creases and will operate nicely. The wait time for the sandwich was long, even though it was premade! Better time management skills by staff is essential but I would think this will correct itself and am willing to give it another go in a few months. As far as food and drink quality - it was pretty fair! I am not a bubble tea drinker but they have tons of different options if you too aren't a fan. When closing time was approaching, my friends and I felt unwelcomed and left. We still had 30 minutes before the doors locked but I guess with it being summer and all, the staff was anxious to get out.  I'm going to ride this one out and return in a few months. If you've been following any of my reviews, service alone will make or break an experience, regardless of taste. I think this business has potential and will try again soon.   EDIT: I've been here a few times since and have really enjoyed their drink and food options. The staff have improved a bit but not by much. I will continue to go as I really like the tea.  EDIT:  After a few more times of paying this shop a visit, it's really grown on me! I go out of my way to grab a matcha latte from here. Plus, this is how I learned of Sweet B's treats. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Looking for a place other then the usual coffee houses, then you should try The Fresh Tea House on Main St. Newmarket. I love bubble tea. While there's are not  the authentic Asian Bubble tea. It was very good.  I had the mango fresh tea with tapioca balls. Nice atmosphere to sit and chat with friends. I previously thought seating was limited but  was pleasantly surprised to see how much seating there was upstairs. Store is bright and has a nice energy flow. Would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"GREAT DRINKS FOR ANYTIME OF THE YEAR! The staff is really nice and there's so many options that it takes forever to choose. The menu can be a little confusing, but that's alright. All I ask for is bigger sizes!"}
{"text":"Great drinks either hot or cold. Fast Wi-Fi. Only thing I would suggest is putting a few more tables on the second level."}
{"text":"Went to the tea shop with my girlfriend and I wasn't planning on getting anything. The cashier kinda explained what I should get and recommended a mango tea ice tea with mango pearls. When I tried it I instantly smiled. I LOVED IT!!   Definitely would come here again right in the corner of Main Street and across ferry lake in Newmarket and across Cachet restaurant"}
{"text":"Can't get a regular cup of tea here...only overpriced \"tea drinks\". The menu is so confusing, cluttered and too much to read. Fail."}
{"text":"I've had better bubble tea. One thing that Newmarket/Aurora can't get right is bubble tea. I want to say that this is like the white-washed version of bubble tea. There's no cool flavours of bubble tea you would find at Pacific Mall."}
