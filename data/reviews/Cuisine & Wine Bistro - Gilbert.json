{"text":"Wife had her favorite dish (fish,shrimp, scallops and mussels } in a white cream sauce  and it more than lived up to her expectations . I had the Filet Mignon and it was cooked to perfection and it was so tender it melted in your palate .  We finished the meal with a delicious Creme brulee. 
Family run business and you feel like they invited you into their home with their hospitality.  
We will surely be eating more meals there . 
Everyone come on over on St Patty's day March 17 and have some Irish Stew and support this family run business in Gilbert .  Everyone is Irish on St. Patrick day so treat yourself to a delicious meal and we will see you there ."}
{"text":"I seem to giving out some five star reviews lately.  However, it is a pleasure to find restaurants that are that good.  The wine list is very good, moderately priced.  There is a very good sauvignon blanc from France for $5/glass, a great way to start the meal.  My wife had the french fries - excellent.  I had the skewer special of the day - shrimp and chorizo.  That was super and a large portion.  The main course was the quiche of the day - duck breast and bacon - wow!  Desert was also special - the chocolate souffle is incredibly rich and the creme brulee was excellent.  The best french food we have had here, very much like a french cafe in France.  Our total - with 4 glasses of wine, two appetizers, one main dish and two desserts was $80 before tip.  The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal with my family and cannot wait to go back! This French family owned restaurant has it all... Ambiance, service, and amazing food!!

{"text":"Fantastic! My fiance and I have been coming to this location since it was operated as MWC. We hadn't been here for a few months, but we noticed that the name had changed. We decided to come in for date night and COULD NOT be happier with the ownership change. The food is exquisite, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the friendly staff is made up of the French family who now owns the bistro. Excellent wine selection! They even serve cappacino/espresso, which pairs nicely with their delicious chocolate souffle :-) We are so happy to live nearby and will be back often!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's family owned and you will feel like family. Family owned means no turn over which means experience, consistency and fantastic service. I have found the menu to be unique and diverse. Their wine selection is also top notch and the wine list is a living document but with several consistent favorites. My favorites? Stella Artois, Federalist Chardonnay, Koffee Kölsch, any cheese board or bruschetta and the salmon salad (you have to have the salmon salad)."}
{"text":"Really nice place, great food, great wine list!  Loved the appetizers during happy hour, so tasty and very generous portions.  Can't wait to come back, you gotta try it, too."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food is fantastic, and the wine options go so well with them. The happy hour bruschetta was awesome. We loved the bratwurst one best.

You can tell that the chef really takes pride in his work. The food is delicious. The presentation is superb. I love that this is also a family-run business."}
{"text":"Mom and I found this place last year and have been fans ever since. I have enjoyed every meal I have had here. They offer a wide selection; I stop in for Wine and Bruschetta's or Meat and Cheese Boards, Salmon Salad or a full on meal with friends. Sit at a table, a sofa pit, the bar or outside. I have ever been dissapointed. I enjoy the atmosphere and they have nice (current but reasonable restaurant) live music on the weekends. Off the busy Gilbert paths it is easy to get to and park. Great food..good prices.  
Support locally owned Gilbert restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Awesome customer service and one of the best bruschetta I have had in a while. Great atmosphere and live music . Would come again."}
{"text":"Great wine bar with excellent service from an eclectic, international staff. They have live music at certain times and the atmosphere is great even when they don't. This is in the heart of Chandler, where places like this are few and far between.

Excellent wine and beer selection and amazing food. Their fried cheese croquettes are absolutely to die for and their meat and cheese board is solid.

Please visit again and again. We want this place to stick around :-)"}
{"text":"We are always looking for good restaurants near the East Valley so we invited friends to go with us.  We had reservations, but did not need them.  We arrived to find a chalkboard telling us to seat ourselves.  We found a table and then waited 10 or more minutes to be acknowledged and receive the menus.  And then there was an additional wait to receive the wine listing, and we were given that by the bartender not our waitress. We were never greeted.  Service continued to be very slow and the waitress was not well trained.    We asked if the salmon was farm raised or wild, and after checking, the waitress told us it was farm raised in Alaska.  We told her we knew that was not true as salmon farms are illegal in Alaska.  She then said it was farm raised from Canada.  The menu is unique and the food very good.  The four of us shared two servings of the bruchette appetizers.  One serving is large enough for two people to share.  These were quite unusual and excellent.  My husband and I each had the cod with vegetables and our friends both had the chicken.  We all enjoyed our entrees.  We did not receive napkins nor silverware until our appetizers were served.  And then they were simply stacked at the end of our table.  My knife was dirty (not water stained, but dirty), but no apology was given when I asked for a clean one.  We were never thanked despite ordering three courses and a bottle of wine.   If this restaurant is to survive, the wait staff will need to learn tableside service.  We definitely did not experience the hospitality that other reviewers told about."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  We ate here last night (4/15/16).  We have eaten here many times, so I'm not sure what happened.  Beef bourguignon meat was dry and not flavorful.  The Burgundy wine was just so-so and not what we expected.  We had to ask for water 3 times.  Our silverware wasn't replaced from the appetizers until we asked for it, AFTER our meals had arrived.  It just wasn't their normal high level of service & food.  Hope this was just an off night, as consistency is key for food and service in the restaurant biz."}
{"text":"Came here five months ago and had a very mediocre evening ...... I'm always willing to give a place a second chance, so I came here tonight and it is under new ownership ...French family ( two families I believe ) And WOW, a world of difference!!!... Fantastic service, amazing wine, delightful ambiance , fantastic menu.   Perfect date place!!... No doubt I shall return,  and soon...and often ."}
{"text":"Oh what a hidden gem this is!  My husband and I dined here on a Thursday night...looking for a relaxing and delicious dinner and wine.  And that's exactly what we got!  The staff were friendly and the food were amazing!  Not to mention they have a very good selection of wine!  Warning though...their food portions are big...which we definitely don't mind at all!  We ordered the escargot and fried brie salad - delicious!!! I ordered the grilled angus ribeye for entree - juicy and very flavorful! My husband ordered the filet mignon - I tried it and it was good and the gravy was very good! And for dessert, we ordered the belgian chocolate soufle' - yum! perfect way to end our meal!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great bistro, just everything in that place make me want to go back again and again.
Their food is delicious, the wine list extensive and the service on point. I could not ask for more."}
{"text":"Always a good place for some great french food and wine. Owners are great people and feel free to practice your French with them."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were new in town and were looking for a nice place to enjoy dinner around Gilbert. We found this place from Yelp, and the reviews were essentially spot on. We ordered the beignet de chorizo to start, the fried brie salad, and the pan crusted cod. The beignets were outstanding (a little on the spicy side). The cod was fantastic, but the cup of rice it was served with was a little bland. The salad was great as well, however, it was way too big for one person. Reading other reviews, this salad is a good size for two people - I definitely agree. We finished the meal with some creme brûlée. All in all, this is a fantastic place to have dinner or a date night. The music was awesome and we will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"date night\" or just after work \"glass of wine & appetizer\" place. I have been coming here since their opening in 2015. What a pleasure to see the same friendly servers one and half years down the road! I love that they recognize me & remember my tastes, I always feel really special. 
The different meat dishes are always cooked to perfection, as are the fish dishes, never over cooked. 
The kitchen staff always put a wonderful effort into their presentations, but still serve their food in such a timely manner. 
This is a great address and just like other Yelpers have said \"It is a hidden gem\". To eat in a quality equivalent upscale restaurant in Scottsdale costs so much more... 
I personally am delighted that you chose Gilbert to open your family run restaurant!"}
{"text":"Marvelous, fantastic French bistro, lovingly run by a French family: mom, dad, sisters and brother all care about the place and work hard to make everything great. Terrific wine list; Killian knows his wines but there's not a snobby bone in his body. This place is a treasure!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is amazing and portions are generous. Live music to top it off. Not too many restaurants with this quality in AZ, check it out."}
{"text":"Great food and live music! Try the terrine de chèvre aux poivron marines! Service was exceptional and the atmosphere very welcoming. Will be back."}
{"text":"The first time we went there was thanks to a message we got on social media about a new french restaurant... Of course we had to try. Well, very happy we did. Our first time there was 9 months ago, and we go there quite often for multiple reasons. First, the team, the family. Killian and his on point suggestions. He knows what he is doing. His passion is contagious. A delight. Mairead, the mom Maitre D', she cares about you, your well being. The whole team, Clementine, Laura, Arthur... and the live music. Fabrice's food is always on point, perfect; not once we were disappointed. Our favorite are the charcuterie and cheese board and the ribeye served on a wooden board. The food, atmosphere, service... they all make you feel good. They treat you as if you were in their home, you can't beat that. Keep on the good work, you are one of our favorite."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food.  Escargo for the first time and it was great!  Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned wine bistro with a very laid back atmosphere with live entertainment on Friday and Saturday evenings.
Authentic French cuisine from family recipe's and the food in excellent!
While the wine list is extensive I personally am not a wine drinker but everyone I take here loves the many options.
I can't wait for the cooler weather so we may bring our dogs and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday, we had dinner at this French Bistro.  While the service was great and very attentive, I don't consider this a French restaurant, having lived in France & Germany.  We had the Bruschettas (choice of 3) and escargots - they were both great.  So were the desserts - creme brulee & bread pudding.  But I didn't consider most of the entrees to be French - Ribeye & NY Strip steaks, filet mignon, so we didn't order them.  My wife enjoyed the duck filets, very tasty.  But with the limited menu entrees, I elected a nightly \"special\" of beef stew - really, a French dish? And most of the items come with French fries,  instead of a choice of vegetables.   But, by far, the biggest disappointment was the wine.  I selected the Dry Reisling, which I expected to be very good quality at $36.00/bottle.  When it was presented to me, I tasted tested it and found it to be OK, so I accepted the bottle.  Then I looked at the label and was very disappointed.  I know how to interpret German wine labeling.  This was a  2012 \"Qualitatswein\", which is at the low end of the labeling scale.  Reislings should be enjoyed withing a couple of years after bottling, not 6 years.  Plus the Villa Wolf vineyards web site states it is in Pfalz region of the Rhein River,  not the upper scale Rheingau wine district. This \"Qualitatswein\", per the Villa Wolf web site states the grapes are from \"contracted growers\", which means the grapes could be grown anywhere in Germany.  Yes the wind was drinkable, but I could buy it in a store for about $8.00 in AZ.  I did not expect an \"up\" charge of $28.00 at a restaurant.  Shame on me for not looking at the bottle first.  But it makes me wonder how over priced and lower value their other wines are."}
{"text":"We discovered Cuisine and Wine Bistro over the weekend.  The owners moved from France about 3 years ago and took over this restaurant in March.  Fabrice the owner and chef has been in the business since his late teens and has owned several establishments.  This is a family affair with his wife and children working there.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  They have a great selection of wines.  The service is what you expect in any restaurant in France: attentive, the courses arriving in a timely manner and our waiter Killian knowledgeable about the menu.
The offerings change often and they also have daily specials, a great way to keep one's interest piqued.  They have live music several nights a week.  This is definitely a must if you want a great meal in a bistro environment without having to trek all the way to Scottsdale.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. We tried late lunch around 3:00 pm...I know it is my fault for not reading, it is not a place to bring kids. They don't have a kids menu of course so they recommended meat balls and fries. The meat balls were super spicy for a child!
Our entrees were OK but nothing impressive... We won't go back."}
{"text":"Our waitress was not attentive and missing for the majority of our visit. Come to find out it was because she was giving her 20% gratuity because we were a party of 12. I definitely will not be back. Food was mediocre, at best.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Eclectic Wines. Delicious Food. Wonderful Ambiance. Friday's and Saturdays are ALWAYS packed so make sure you have a reservation!  It's a fabulous place to take a date."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night to listen to some jazz blown away by the music food and staff. All were amazing. The escargot was like Paris. So yummy and so much garlic lol.  bruchette was also very good  cannot say enough about the staff. They were amazing even though the place was packed.  Look forward to making this a place I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. This evening was fantastic. First visit and service was excellent. Brought parents and Uncle & Aunt. We devoured impeccable escargot; huge lite delicious Quiche Lorraine (special tonight) and decadent creme Brulee & chocolate soufflé.   Wonderful wonderful wonderful."}
{"text":"I just went here on the 15th and this place is seriously so amazing!!! Their food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is really nice too! Definitely give them a try and if you are looking for a good beer, they've got this coffee brew that literally tastes like heaven!! So good!!!!"}
{"text":"Whatever initial problems the staff of Cusine and Wine Bistro might have had when first opened, they have progressed past that, and we were impressed by our first time visit. Family run, personable staff, and great food and drink.

Compared to Postinos, you experience an atmosphere that isn't so overly loud that it is hard to carry on a conversation. The food and the restaurant has a French influence, but this is not just a French restaurant/bistro. We had three of their appetizers, so we had to skip the main course. Two of the current main courses, a ribeye dinner and grilled salmon salad looked wonderful.

Our bruschetta was one of the best I have ever had, with the bread very light and perfectly toasted to allow all the toppings to come through. Another appetizer, the goat cheese with toasted bread had a very generous serving of tasty goat cheese. The only thing not cooked to 100% of my liking was the meatballs and mint sauce. The mint sauce was wonderful, but the meatballs seemed a bit overcooked for my taste.

They frequently have live music, although we left before they started (we came in early during the happy hour pricing)

We will return."}
{"text":"Our absolute new favorite dining spot.  Family operated.  Outstanding food.  Fantastic wine list and even better service.  We come here at east once a week.  A true gem in Gilbert.  Love, love, love this place!  .....and they have live acoustic music on the weekend."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night, 4/15/2016, and it was wonderful. We eat here several times per month and always enjoy the atmosphere and the service. The bruschetta is so delishous and flavorful. It seems I always get the escargot and it never disappoints. For our entree, my wife and I had the Beef Bourguignon special. Oh, it was so good. The beef was cooked well and was very flavorful. The sauce was out of this world tasty, to the point that we were dipping the fries in it to get every last drop. No dessert this night for us but as usual it was another excellent dining experience for us."}
{"text":"Not as good as we hoped it would be. In fact the food was not something we would go back for. I ordered the pork tenderloin dish. The pork was a bit tough and dry but the worst part was the broken orange sauce it was covered in. Not a fan. My wife had a flank steak which we expected to be somewhat tough, it was and the sauce it was covered in was also not good. The on redeeming quality was the draft beer I had was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow, what a good find! My wife and I went there last night. I had the Filet de Poulet à la Moutarde à l'Ancienne. It was to die for!... My wife had the Hachi Parmentier which was also good. Our waitress was very friendly. Great experience overall--especially because French restaurants are usually overpriced and cliché (which is frustrating for a frenchman). Cuisine and Wine Bistro had an authentic feel and a relaxed atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely amazing. Relaxing music, friendly staff, whatever we want. I'm enjoying a delicious French sparkler with my appetizers which are enough for a meal and listening to a terrific live artist. As an international traveler I can confidently say this is authentic French as only the French can do. Attention to detail is perfect. Please come and keep them in business. On second thought, stay away. This is my treasure...don't ruin it."}
{"text":"Found them on Yelp. Great little find. Excellent French influence priced right. Looking for something different? Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cuisine and Wine Bistro in Gilbert is the best kept secret in the area.  The food is AMAZING and it is run by a family from France that leaves the many previous owners in the dust.  Don't be worried about the small menu choice...they change it every couple of weeks so you can look forward to new amazing menu to choose from.  The whole staff is devoted to you having a wonderful meal and great experience while you are there.  The bands they contract with are also GREAT! This is our new favorite neighborhood wine bar for sure!! I would give this 10 STARS if I could!!"}
{"text":"We came with high expectations and we're not disappointed! Bruschetta board was fantastic. The Brie bruschetta was amazing. The blend of flavors is perfection. I had the cod and my husband had the filet mignon for our main dish. Both were flavorful and portioned well. The dessert was the best. You have to get the chocolate soufflé. If I could eat that all the time without getting fat I would. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Had the
Special with a salad. Presentation is beautiful, owners are delightful and wine is top quality. Try the F French wine- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Casual, cozy, comfortable, variety, FUN and DELICIOUS! Maybe it was the wine, maybe it was the good vibes, but whatever magic it was, we will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Mixed experience on second trip to Cuisine and Wine Bistro. Had a salad and bruschetta while my wife had an order of escargot and quiche. Two glasses of wine and a bottle of water and it was over $100 including tip. A fairly expensive glass of red wine was served chilled... come on now, this is a French restaurant. The food was very good but we were shocked to see we were charged $10 for a bottle of water. Service was good but two regulars sitting next to us received very favorable pours of wine while ours were meticulously measured. No big deal, just made us feel like less important customers. Music being played did not match the cuisine...always hate that. Overall, very good food, expensive and the experience had a couple hiccups."}
{"text":"It's our second time here and both have been very good! We came with a group on Saturday, and were so impressed we came back today for happy hour to sample some more wines and appetizers.  No disappoints her for sure!  I had escargots that rivaled a French restaurant in Maui I went to last week! And it was a heck of a lot cheaper.  The waiter was very attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"This is one of the finest restaurants in Arizona, having moved from Europe many years ago, to be able to taste authentic French cuisine is amazing. The escargot and tartare are out of this world, exceptional flavoring and perfect blend of herbs and spices. The staff are amazing, a  really welcoming family, Killian one of the mangers made sure to recommend the perfect wine pairings to accompany our meal. The ambience is perfect for a romantic dinner or a lovely experience with friends. I have been back several times since I first tried it, and can honestly say you won't regret going here, the cost is exceptional considering the Michelin level of restaurant this should be. Can't wait to go back again and taste the lobster risotto. Definitely one of the best restaurants in the USA, a most go for everyone."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me there Saturday night for an early birthday dinner.  It was our first time and we had an excellent experience!  Linda was our server and she was amazing!  Very sweet and knowledgable, we were amazed when she told us she was new.  The way she was helping everyone and running all over the place but never kept us waiting, gave us the impression she was either a manager or owned the place!  The two gentlemen who were playing music made the experience even more enjoyable, it wasn't too loud and their sound was incredible!  And of course, the wine was good, but the food was TERRIFIC.  We both ordered the filets with a delicious mushroom sauce and came with some sort of baked garlic tomato (which was possibly my favorite thing!) and a nice twice baked potato.  The fact they had a dog friendly patio was the cherry on top (we met the cutest little puppy named Max who I believe is a regular there.)  We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"For a recent wedding anniversary, my wife found out about this Cuisine & Wine Bistro, which we had never previously heard of.  So we went there relatively early one evening so that way we could beat the crowd.  It maintains a fabulously casual atmosphere with a bar, tables, and couches for various kinds of lounging about and eating.  The staff have all been super as well as super-friendly, willing to make recommendations for newcomers to the restaurant.  We're not big wine drinkers, and they were even able to make recommendations to help create a better dining experiences for us novices.  As for the appetizers?  They specialize in bruschetta, and they even rotate their various choices in and out on a monthly basis so that you're always able to try new combinations.  The steaks we've had have been exceptional, and this has become one of the places in our regular restaurant rotation.  Lovely place."}
{"text":"What a horrific experience. I ordered pork and it came smothered in onions which was not mentioned on the menu. The chef literally came out of the kitchen and started demeaning me for being allergic to onions. They told me I the dish couldn't be remade. And that was it. They never offered me a menu. I literally sat across from my company while they are their dinner and I stared at an empty plate. The server Susie was very kind and very embarrassed. The kitchen chef was rude, talked about me as a guest rudely, and came out of the kitchen again just to shoot me a dirty look. Never felt so horrible as a guest. The Flank steak wasn't very tasty. I know because I tried to share it with my guest."}
{"text":"Delicious and great service! Nice to have French cuisine so close to home.  And loved the red blend 'Locations F' wine- it has become my new favorite!"}
{"text":"Anyone considering a dinner with perfect customer service and excellent food, go here! Friday nights are awesome; easy, live music is played at volumes which you can still have a conversation with those at your table.  My wife and I have gone multiple times and all the staff members are super nice, courteous, and are not in a hurry to push you out the door only to fill it with another patron. Food is awesome, wine is great, atmosphere is delightful. Again, go here! This place is amazing."}
{"text":"I highly recommend! Great food, wine, and atmosphere! Prices were fair and it was cozy and not too loud! Service was outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice, both times were absolutely fabulous. My latest visit was a Friday night. We were seated immediately. They had live music that entertained us the entire evening. This place is family run and they're always stopping by to make sure everything is good. Their service is an A+

The food: Both times I've been there the food has been amazing. It's my favorite restaurant for charcuterie, which is one of my favorite meals. The mixed board comes with 3 delicious cheese and 3 yummy meats. It's also accompanied by some nuts, raspberry preserves, toasted bread, little pickles and a light salad. It's devine. The bruschetta are all amazing, I've tried all of them now and you can't go wrong. The parma ham bruschetta is my favorite though. On this last trip we also ordered the roasted goat cheese salad. The warm goat cheese is served in bread, accompanied by bacon, lemon honey and a light salad mix. It was absolutely perfect and the honey completely made the meal. 

If you haven't been here you're missing out. Great little restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was truly just ok. I was definitely excited about trying it, and hoping for more! The service was nice, but the food was really nothing memorable. I had the salmon (entire bloodline and some flavorless skin left on) and my husband had the pork filet. I would be willing to try it again - maybe just for some drinks and music."}
{"text":"This place is good, however the changing menu is hit or miss. For instance, the first time my significant other and I dined here, we had a filet with a peppercorn sauce that was literally out of this world to die for and we immediately put this place down as one of our favorites and planned to come here often. The second time around we had a filet with a different sauce that was.........really disappointing coming back from the previous meal. Third time around we had a duck filet that was great. We are weary to come here only because we never know what's on the menu.

The food has a French inspiration to it. I don't know what some of the reviewers are on about here, beef in a wine sauce or stew is a cornerstone of French cuisine. Maybe not at the one off restaurant you were in next to the Eiffel Tower on your trip to Paris but if you actually go out in the country you'll see it quite often. The wine is good. My only suggestion is to change up the sides once in awhile?"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I have been to a few wine bistros around the valley and this one definately made an impression. Good wine list, Awesome service and FANTASTIC FOOD! The price is reasonable, they have a good happy hour selection... I so enjoyed the French accents of the staff. I highly recommend this establishment. I will definately be back."}
{"text":"I took my Mom out for a mother's day dinner there, second time we've been there and this place doesn't disappoint. Smoked salmon bruchettas for an appetizer, duck for entree, and berry chocolate dessert accompanied by a bottle of wine - delicious! Already looking for an excuse to go there for dinner again to try the rest of the menu.:) The prices are pretty good for a nice place like this but you still end up spending over $100 if you get all of the above. Worth it for a great meal and atmosphere though. So glad there is a classy place like this Bistro in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've been here at least 5 times already and they never cease to amaze.  The food is fantastic and there is plenty of it.  Wine selection is great and service is good and they are super friendly.  Good place to try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Went for a Friday happy hour and was pleasantly surprised! 

We shared a few bites from the blackboard menu of daily specials and the attractiveness, quality, and freshness of the dishes impressed us (on this particular day we had the escargots in butter & garlic, puff pastry with seafood, and the hand-cut fries). Several of the main dishes we saw served looked attractive and well prepared.

The wine selection is quite diverse with some unexpected varietals (and tastes), and the staff are more than willing to provide great suggestions for pairings.

Service was attentive and professional reflecting knowledge of the restaurant business and appropriate training.

We will certainly go back - this time for dinner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were here today.  We had the mixed charcuterie board (great) and finished our snack with the Creme Brûlée (even better).  Cannot wait to come back for one of their duck dinners.  Was definitely worth the 25 minute drive from AJ."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and it was perfect! The atmosphere was great! They had live music, friendly staff, and the food was amazing! We started with the chorizo app (so tasty) and some drinks (beer & wine only). I had the duck breast & was extremely pleased with my choice! My gf had the filet mignon, which was the best tasting steak I can remember eating! The whole experience was amazing. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"So glad to find this little treasure but it looks like everyone else has to as no tables were available for 2 on a hot summer night.     The owner was apologetics and offered to sit us at the bar which we did and immensely enjoyed our first trip to Cuisine & Wine Bistro.  The décor was lovely, the staff genuine despite being super busy and the prices reasonable for excellent quality and presentation.   The live music by local talent was an extra special touch and created a wonderful ambiance but not too loud where we could not still have a conversation.    I am so thankful to have this venue close to home and look forward to returning though with popularity growing would suggest reservations if you want to ensure a table."}
{"text":"Great service all around,  my wife and I had plans to go to a Scottsdale restaurant for our 32nd Anniversary and our plans got spoiled. So I remembered driving by the restaurant and thought it would be nice to try and after reading all the great reviews from Yelp we went.  I knew we were in the right place when we walked in the door.  We were greeted and seated right away and served our wine promptly.  Being from Northern California originally we are a bit on the snobby side when it comes to wine.  We weren't disappointed the wine selection was very extensive and well rounded.  
We ordered the Rib Eyes and they were cooked to perfection with a nice sized portion of salad and potatoes.  We probably should have shared one as the portion was pretty good size.  Our waitress was very attentive and recommend the chocolate soufflé wish I highly recommend, it was not too sweet and the presentation was nice."}
{"text":"This place is a gem and truly amazing. I had the filet, the chorizo appetizer and the chocolate soufflé. They had live music on a Saturday night. I could not ask for a better place to spend a special night."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!!  I went there for the first time this past Friday (4/15) with some friends.  From the second we walked in the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Since we had never been there before we had a few questions about the menu and our server was very knowledgeable and even offered us a few suggestions.  Can I just say you really need to try the bruschetta...it was soooo good!  We got several different kinds and they all tasted great and were cooked perfectly too!  I was very impressed with the wine selection and my friends loved the beer they had (I don't remember what kind it was).  I am looking forward to going back, I can tell this is going to be a place my friends and I visit a lot."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food, great atmosphere, service was spot on. Wine was very good.  I had a pork dish and my wife had salmon. Both were good and presented very nicely.  I also had a tomato and mozzarella dish that was very nice. The salads were plates in such a great way."}
{"text":"What a gem here in central Gilbert! I drive by this place on my way to work every day and didn't realize it had such good reviews until I discovered it here on Yelp. It is a small French restaurant with interesting food! Everything we tried was quite delicious, we will be back! The owners are very friendly and I recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. The entire restaurant is run by a French family from Paris. The quality of food is uncommon for the East Valley.  The French know how to eat."}
{"text":"Fabulous bistro. Took my hubby for his birthday. Escargot and bruschetta platter. Then wonderful steaks. A wine tasting going on as well. Too full for the chocolate soufflé. We are only visitors but will be back next year! Try this place. It won't disappoint. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Just opened a month ago. Adorable French bistro and wonderful French, Italian, New Zealand and some California wines! Great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place! The atmosphere is great, the staff is great and the food is to die for!
Oh the bread! It's the right amount of crunch and softness. The bruschetta and charcuterie board are my favorite. The cheese is oh so French and oh so creamy. This is just the place for relaxing with great wine and enjoyable conversation with just the right level of cool French music."}
{"text":"The food and service was very good. We both had the filet which was delicious with the peppercorn sauce and excellent potato. It did take about an hour to get our entree but we did order the escargot. My wife loved it but the pesto was a little too much for me. For desert we had the chocolate soufflé which was life changing. Overall, a very nice experience. Quicker service and this place is five stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight for the first time. It was a great experience! The front was a little off putting as you walk in to a seat yourself sign, but we were quickly greeted. Live music was low and pleasant, we could still talk.  The service was great, all family working this locally owned gem! The appetizers were awesome, we had several.  My husband had a great cod dish. It was light and flaky. I had the chorizo croquettes and they were light and crispy on the outside, and delicate and moist inside, with a hint of heat. Wish we had room for desert, but I am motivated to go back just for that and a glass of wine tomorrow!  We have found a great local hangout!"}
{"text":"This place is very gun, great music, awesome food and superb customer service. The ambience is very relaxing and comfortable for date night."}
{"text":"This place is amazing... Great food and great service. They have live music on the weekends thats actually pretty good and not so loud that you cant have a conversation. If you are looking for a new place with great prices and great food, check it out!"}
{"text":"Our Server was Clementine and she was amazing. Adorable French family runs the place and they serve authentic French cuisine, one of the best places I have been to in the valley. The wine list was unique and delightful, even my mother, a wine snob, agrees. We had an amazing appetizer, a chef special of chorizo shrimp and in a garlic aioli. For our main entree we shared roasted salmon in a bouche blanc sauce with julienned vegetables. Finally we finished with a perfectly executed creme brûlée. Will be returning for many more delicious meals!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! The food is excellent. Settle in with a bruschetta board, enjoy a fried Brie salad before steak frites, and top it off with soufflé. Every course was nothing short of phenomenal. Don't tell your friends though, this is my new go-to spot."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley!!
I am from France, so the Bistro reminds me so much of my country!
You have to try the escargot appetizer it was delicious. And their \"seafood au gratin\" was a blast. 
I asked and the chef is French with a lot of experience, 
Staff is super nice and they can always recommend a good wine.

Overall, it is a fantastic place for having dinner!"}
{"text":"Wow what a place! The service is great and friendly! The food is reasonably priced for the portions and the quality. Everything tastes great and nothing is over the top.

The beer and wine selection is great! Bistros often  offer fewer drink options than this place!

The escargot was amazing! And the molten chocolate soufflé is beyond delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Was looking for someplace new to try and I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place. The food was fantastic and very well presented. The ambiance was relaxing and easy on the eyes. I didn't want to go home."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed this place and will definitely be back. The escargot was absolutely the best I've ever had. The charcuterie was fantastic and gigantic - we actually couldn't eat it all. Our waitress Clementine was delightful - she's quite French with a marvelous French accent.  This place is tucked inside a corner shopping center in Gilbert and you could drive by here a hundred times and never know this place existed -- it's worth looking for."}
{"text":"Au top!!!
J'ai été mangé à Cuisine & Wine Bistro en juin, et le moins que je puisse dire, c'est qu'on retrouve un peu de France dans ce restaurant!
Nourriture maison très bonne, vin super et relativement abordables!
A bientôt! :)"}
{"text":"Wow this was some really good French food. Very authentic (besides larger American sized portions). I loved everything we had: hashi parmentier, terrine de chèvre, poulet/sauce moutarde. We will totally be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here before, you need to try it! Such great people, yummy food and good atmosphere.  These folks know how to make you feel welcomed and appreciated. The food is fantastic...seriously one of the most amazing cheese boards ever! Live music almost every night, but don't worry its not overwhelming,  it only enhances the vibe. So glad they've figured it out and we have a great wine bar in Gilbert once again."}
{"text":"Well maybe we had an unlucky experience, but my wife and I were just not impressed. After reading other reviews, we were very excited to try the Bistro. It's close to home, has a nice atmosphere with live music and friendly servers. All great, but unfortunately the food just missed the mark for us. 

The Ribeye with chipotle butter (authentic french cuisine?) was flavorless, fatty and looked large, but thin on the plate. The Filet de Porc, Sauce Bleu et Bacon sounded amazing, but lacked the rich complex flavor you would expect. My wife did not eat more than 1/3 of the ribeye and we commented to the server she did not like it and the server replied \"Oh, I'm very sorry, would you like a box?\" Not the response I was expecting.

Anyways we really wanted to like the Bistro, but it just wasn't the dining experience we had hoped for."}
{"text":"A nice cozy little restaurant with a wonderful ambiance. Came here for a birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised with the food and wine/ beer selection. We came during happy hour and started off with some appetizers . One of the specials was a shrimp and chorizo sausage skewers with peppers which we ordered. The flavor of the shrimp was good but I wasn't a fan of the chorizo sausage because it was very dry. Maybe it was over cooked? I should have went with my first choice the chorizo corquettes! ( next time I'll make sure to order that)
For our main dish I ordered the salmon with vegetables in a creamy sauce and my fiancé got the filet mignon with potatoes. The filet was cooked a nice medium rare and the flavor was good. My salmon was also cooked nicely and I enjoyed the creamy sauce that was mixed in with the vegetables. ( it made a good dipping sauce for the salmon as well )
Overall I enjoyed our food, our service was good and I enjoyed the live music they had. This restaurant is also dog friendly and if bring your dog, they will take a polaroid of your dog and put it on their \" Woof of Fame\"!  . My only complaint is the smell and how long it took our food  to come out. There was a weird smell from the moment we walked in and until we left and the smell made it unpleasant."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing!! We highly recommend the Caprese salad and the fried Swiss cheese for appetizers, which was so delicious!! Amber was our server and she was so wonderful! Highly recommend this place. There was live music while we all sat outside on the patio enjoying our drinks and food. We all will be back!!"}
{"text":"Good service.  Great food.  Pleasantly surprised by the appetizer and dinner.  Would go again without hesitation."}
{"text":"How do you say, I've died and gone to heaven in French...Cuisine and Wine Bistro...that's how!!! Everything we had was phenomenal, from Champagne to Porte, Chorizo Croquettes to Chocolate Soufflé, Fried Brie Salad to perfectly grilled Ribeye...every morsel melted in our mouth leaving our taste buds begging for more and stomachs crying for relief! The service was impeccable, we felt like the only table there. Live music Friday and Saturday was the icing on the cake! Seriously couldn't have had a better 40th birthday anywhere!"}
{"text":"The food was yummy and the wine was good, but the service we received was not. Our server was rude and not welcoming from the moment we sat down. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Late review posting. Went here for NYE. Been to CWB twice. First time was actually thier first night in business. As you can imagine, there was quite a few issues which is to be expected. 

2nd experience was an absolute delight. Wow! Family is from France, chef has 30 years of experience, soft live acoustic music, great wine selection, everything about this meal was amazing. Impeccable service on a busy night. I will be visiting this place at least 5-6 times a year, for sure."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Tried this place out on a Friday night. Great atmosphere with live music. The cheese plate we had was delicious. The staff was very friendly. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Perfect for intimate date setting. Quiet, soft music, small restaurant. 100% authentic French cuisine. Huge portions. Helpful and attentive waitress. Explained menu items. I could've split and entree and added a salad. Entrees typically $18-28.  Took my S/O for a celebratory dinner and he ordered the steak. Beautiful presentation, huge portions, delish tomato herb butter on top.  The S/O reported this is the best steaks he's ever had. Incredible experience from a small seemingly mom & pop shop."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter and son-in-law-to-be for a wonderful casual afternoon meal.  GREAT SERVICE and delicious food.  We ate outside on a wonderful day, and my kids enjoyed the craft beers and wine, and I treated myself to a desert - a lovely creme brule.  The happy hour prices were reasonable as well.  We enjoyed ambience, food, and service.  The only problem was a smell of gas INSIDE but I believe that was a temporary problem and eating outside was quite pleasant.

I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Every bite was delicious and the service was perfect. We had the escargot, pork, salmon, a potato dish special, and the soufflé. Everything was wonderful. And they had great taste in live music as well. So happy to such a great place nearby."}
{"text":"First time here and wow what a great find! My husband and I wanted a quiet laid back place to have a glass of wine and this place was perfect for that. The food was great, the wine was great, and really great service. Can't wait to have a date here again!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying they had an off night tonight.  I tried not having high expectation when I saw the perfect five star yelp rating, and I definitely was excited to try the menu.  

Located in an unassuming strip mall, our group of seven headed over here after our Escape the Room event in the same mall.  We were greeted and seated promptly. The interior was decorated warmly and the live music was a pleasant surprise. My group placed me in charge of ordering the wine, and I was none too pleased with the two wine samples so I opted not to order a few wine bottles for our table. Bummer.  There  was no hard liquor at all, and they were out of some of the beer we wanted.  Bummer again.  

I had to ask about the specials of the day, and we were only told about the appetizer specials, not the main course specials.  We ordered not knowing if there were main course specials.  We started with a bruchetta spread of Pesto, Eggplant, Artichoke, Brie, Bratwurst, and Parma Ham.  They were all fantastic, the french bread was perfectly toasted and not hard.  Definitely a must order.  Next was an order of the Beignets de Fromage, also really tasty, sweet and satisfying.  Two orders of the Hand cut fries  were enjoyed.  They were medium cut, not crisp nor oily, had a hint of truffle oil, and came with a dipping sauce.  Next we opted for the Fromage Board.  It would have been nice for them to point out the various cheeses when placed on the table.  Lots of fresh, warm perfectly toasted french bread accompanied the cheese board.  Lastly, the Fried Brie was delicious, came with a mixed green salad, and a nice berry chutney.  

Three of us waited for our onion Soup, and waited, and waited.  Every one around us was getting their soup except our table.  This soup was part of todays appetizer special.  Three others in our party also wanted to add the onion soup.  Also, the Gaspacho was never brought out to another person in our group.  Long story short we flagged our waiter, and after she briefly denied that we ordered the soup and gazpacho, she admitted to making an error with the computer program, and apologized profusely.  Regardless, the situation was her was awkward and very uncomfortable, at one point she kneeled down and only talked to one member of of group.  Why not address all of us?  After about ten minutes, the Gaspacho came out, but we were informed they had ran out of soup!  The owner came by, and, once again, was basically talking to one member of the party when five of the seven of us were not happy at this point.  She was sincere and we all understand mistakes happen, but own up to it, address the issue, offer us a solution and move on.  We were offered a dessert spread instead of actual food.  Uncomfortable at the server and owners discomfort, we said we would take the dessert.  By now we decided we would leave and not eat main meals.  The Chocolate  soufflé came out burnt, and the inside chocolate was not molten nor melted but a big gob of chocolate.  

In summary, we were not happy about the wine samples, the appetizers were great, we don't know about the main meals because we never got there, and the chocolate soufflé (meant to make amends) was burnt.  Based on the other reviews in yelp, this is clearly an anomaly yet still very disappointing."}
{"text":"I use Yelp reviews all the time, but this is the first detailed one I have felt compelled to write. I had a very disappointing experience at Cuisine and Wine Bistro this weekend. Even though we were not told in advance, and the receipt was folded over in a way that seemed designed to disguise it, large parties have an automatic gratuity added on. I am not opposed to this practice, and in fact, I understand it. However, I have a couple of issues with C&WB's technique. It's a 20% auto-gratuity (typically an amount reserved for customers who judge service to be excellent), and our service was barely mediocre, at best. We felt forgotten several times (it wasn't very busy) and everyone had an empty glass for longer than desired on at least one occasion. One person in our party actually got up to seek out our server. There were things that our server did well - for example, she gave us separate checks and she was generally nice when she was there, but bottom line ... service was not excellent by a long shot. 

If you are going to force people to tip 20%, I would hope that you would provide service that is at least good, if not great."}
{"text":"Everything about this eatery is absolutely wonderful! I decided to pop in with my little sister and she too was equally as impressed. It's a family run restaurant and you can truly feel and appreciate that everyone works together to give you the best dining experience. The service was fantastic! Our server gave us some recommendations on what to order and what some of the house faves are, and everything was delicious! We had the chorizo croquettes to start, along with some fries that were honestly the best fries I have ever had! Seriously, order them. We then had the grilled salmon which was cooked to perfection and finished off with the apple bread pudding! Can't wait to go back to try more delicious food accompanied by some beautiful wines."}
{"text":"Everything was so great! My sister picked this restaurant for her birthday dinner and it was above and beyond what I expected. They reserved an area for us next to the live music being played (which he was really talented!) and it was so cute with the couches and pillows! We ordered a meat and cheese board; excellent! The chorizo croquettes is something I have been telling friends to go try! I also ordered the chicken cordon bleu and fries and it was defiantly enough to share! We had such a great time and the owners and family are such great people to my sister we will not forget their kindness :)"}
{"text":"Found this surprise randomly looking for a wine bar.  Hate the name...what they have deserves more creativity.  The food was good.  Had the salmon bruschetta- delish, fresh and very tasty w:different toppings.  Great wine selection"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place, had seen the great reviews and pictures of the food. My daughter had a concert nearby so we decided to go here after. I walked in at 8:45 and asked for a table for three and was promptly told that the kitchen was closed (even though the hours posted said they were open til 10:00 PM.) I told her a table wouldn't be necessary then and she told me we could stay and drink. It was a rather odd exchange.  
So I guess what I'm saying is you might want to call ahead and make sure they are in the mood to serve food before you drive over there. On a bright note the pasta I made yesterday reheated well so my daughter's celebratory dinner of leftovers was nice (5 stars)..."}
{"text":"Love the food and the ambiance of this place! I'm definitely coming back around but for the live music!! 

I've been to France a few times and I think this food has been right on par with some of the better food experiences I've had in Paris. My favorite was the poached pear - so light and refreshing, absolutely PERFECT for this crazy Arizona heat! Add a glass of chilled white wine and you're good to go. The bruschetta were all pretty good - for me, the bratwurst bruschetta wasn't a huge standout, but the brie and the parma ham were très bien! And I can't say enough good things about the duck!! Just look at that beauty! The orange and Grand Marnier sauce complemented the duck very well without making it too sweet. I'd definitely recommend if you're not in the mood for something as heavy as a steak!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a wonderful evening here. My husband and I were looking for a new, romantic, chill place to try and this restaurant fully delivered.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful (with a delightful French accent), we took her recommendations and split the goat cheese salad and the filet mignon and they were both very satisfying.  The bread that came with the salad, combined with the warm goat cheese and lemon-honey sauce, was very delicious.  The steak was very tender & cooked perfectly, however I found the flavor to be slightly less bold than I'm used to in filet mignon.  It was still very edible though, and came with delicious fries and a warm, bread-crumb encrusted tomato.  My husband enjoyed their Chilean Pinot Noir, I decided to pass on the wine  (mostly out of budget consideration, not for lack of selection).  We also very much enjoyed the live music which was a female vocalist with a beautiful voice who seemed to mostly be doing covers but was very talented (& it was not too loud or distracting but fit the atmosphere perfectly).  This has definitely made one of our new favorites!"}
{"text":"So sad this has changed owners. The food is mediocre and the service spotty. What once was an amazing wine bar is now staffed by inept staff. Our waiter couldn't pronounce Bordeaux!! And the red wine is not at temperature. I love the patio and atmosphere but everything else is a miss."}
{"text":"Such a nice place, great food, great service, will definitely come back! 
(Try the chocolate soufflé)"}
{"text":"Escargot is a must! The cheese board is a got to have, the wine is always on point. I have personally enjoyed the duck, salmon, a few different steaks, many different specials... always enjoyed every bite and always want to come back. Perfect for date night and also my go to spot for happy hour! Everyone there is fantastic and I feel so lucky to be able to enjoy coming here regularly!"}
{"text":"Love this place. This is the hidden gem in Gilbert. Good wine, excellent cheese tray, and the best creme broulee ever had.  Sometimes we even eat the entree"}
{"text":"Molly and I have been a few times (this location and the one in South Chandler) and it's always solid. Great wine, great food and great service. Just be aware that they aren't open on Sundays and Mondays, which we've found out the hard way when we've shown up for dinner and found it closed!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I found this place. The food and service were perfect. One my first visits I stayed longer than I intended because I was enjoying the live music. I went three times and saw familiar faces, when you notice regulars that tells you it is a good place to be!"}
{"text":"Our book club meets here once a month and we love it. The food is delicious, especially the chorizo croquettes, goat cheese salad, and bruschetta boards.  Wonderful place to go for a casual meetup or a fancy night out. The live music is great too. I would definitely recommend trying this place out. I have not eaten any of the entrees, but they always look and smell delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place, Elegant environment? great service! The food was awesome! I did ask about the chef, he comes from France! Omg! Can u imagine real French chef! For the wine and drinks, you have many of choice price and taste was so good! Have to try this place and then you will come back!"}
{"text":"Have been there for dinner twice, it is family owned, family run French restaurant, the service is fantastic and the food it's unbelievable good, you would never think that little place on the corner would hold so much goodness!"}
{"text":"A wonderful experience. A throwback to what dining should be. Outstanding service, owner touching the tables and interactive, small kitchen with attention to detail to producing outstanding cuisine. Really loved it and cannot wait to go back again and again!  

Very authentic French cuisine and delicious and delicate. We loved it!!!"}
{"text":"A local favorite, ideal for a casual drink, date night, or group outing! 

The food is fabulous whether you are craving nibbles or a fine meal. 

I have found the semi-private room and the patio ideal to host my business mixers and a monthly wine group.

As a family owned restaurant, environment is warm & friendly. 

We love stopping in on a Friday night for live music!"}
{"text":"Still in love with that place!!
Its nice to come to a place and sincerely trust the chef and his team. I'm talking about the specials, always something new and fresh to try out.
Order few things on the menu and the black board, went on the patio had some wine. Spend few hours (they have misters) dog friendly.
Was amazing"}
{"text":"The Cuisine and Wine Bistro is everything a dining experience should be. My wife and I make it a point to treat ourselves to authentic French cuisine here at least once a week. The food is, simply put, unparalleled. To start, the escargot is a must try. It's rich, buttery, and smells as good as it tastes. We also love the chorizo croquettes, if you're looking for something with a southwestern kick. 

For a main dish, the ribeye is perfection. Chef Fabrice expertly cooks and seasons the meat, topping it with homemade chipotle butter that progressively melts over the simmering steak (the flavor of the butter changes with the seasons, it seems). The size of the ribeye is certainly generous, as my wife and I often share it. If you're looking for something on the lighter side, the quiche lorraine is equally delicious. And if you've saved room for dessert, get the chocolate souffle. It's decadent, and perfect with a scoop of ice cream.

What keeps us coming back is not only the food, but the service. This family owned restaurant makes you feel like family. We always have the pleasure of having Laura as our server. She caters to our every whim (no easy feat), and remembers what we like. If you're looking for world class French cuisine in a comfortable environment, look no further."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect:  the ambiance, the food's quality, the service, the wine and the friendly staff.  I will definitely will be a regular customer!  It is my 3rd visit now and I am enjoying it each time."}
{"text":"Fabulous! What a hidden gem! The service and food were outstanding. I highly recommend the chorizo croquettes and crème brûlée...nom!  My boyfriend and I went for date night and they completely exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is beyond amazing... Which is why I'm giving 4 stars. I feel like the food quality has slipped since they first opened though. The last two times I've been in the food (specifically entrees) has been nothing great at all. If the cook staff is anything like the extremely warm and friendly kid that is always working at the bar, I'm sure they will get things figured out. Until then, this is definitely a great place for wine and croquettes! But I will skip the full meal for now."}
{"text":"We were wanting to find a soufflé to try and ended up finding this place on Yelp just a half mile from our house! Looks like a wannabe restaurant from the outside so even though we'd seen it 1000 times, we never thought about coming here. Decided to give it a shot. The inside was WAY nicer than I would have expected. Very nice ambiance. We tried the Belgian chocolate soufflé and the creme brûlée. Soufflé was amazing! Just what I expected. The creme brûlée seemed a little burnt but still tasted great. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Whoa. AMAZING! Great happy hour. We had the bruschetta, mint meatballs and the chorizo croquettes. Finished up with the chocolate soufflé. Everything was made with LOVE. And it was topped off with impeccable service. I am so glad we tried this place!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! The wine list is excellent and the food is cooked to perfection. We have been here several times and will return for more. The atmosphere is very relaxed but classy. Just wonderful!"}
{"text":"Drove directly here from Sky Harbor after reading the awesome Yelp reviews.  Wifey and I met my brother and his esposa here for dinner and wine.  Stupid us, we went through the gate into the back door.  Duh?  Poor signage or stupid clients?  Probably the latter.  Haha.  Hostess was gracious.  Server was somewhere between neutral and friendly: just the basic bring-the-food type gal.  Very little chit chat and apparently no knowledge of wine.  The food was served quickly, was nicely presented, fresh and flavorful.  Everything was delicious and we all snarved our meals like wolverines.  The only letdown was the wine list.  It mentioned only the wine variety and price with no mention of the winery, vineyard, or year.  So, there's really no way to know what you're getting.  That's just frankly weird.  

Food 4 stars
Service 3 stars
Wine 3.5 stars
Wine menu 1 star"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Super friendly staff, great food. My first time having escargot and it was fantastic.
Super clean restaurant  too. 
One of the best dining experiences I have had ever."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Enjoyed their succulent escargot. Told the waitress that I tried to find low carb food on the menu. She recommended the filet mignon. She came back to the table just to mention that there are some bread crumbs on the baked tomato that comes with the dinner - how thoughtful!  My daughter enjoyed a quiche and the wonderful Creme brûlée. I had 2 teaspoons of the desert and hated my diet lol. It was very difficult to stop eating more. Enough said!  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Wow... When I read the other reviews I thought maybe all of the other reviews were being kind but nope. This place is truly amazing.  Let's start with the service it was phenomenal.  She was attentive, had good recommendations on wine and refilled water all night. I love when you don't have to ask for a refill on water. 
The food... sigh I'm going to dream of the beignets de fromage... light, fluffy and not greasy.  Perfect cheesy bite.  We also had the chorizo croquettes warm, slightly spicy and had a great sauce over them.  

The three of us shared a meat/cheese platter which was also excellent. The chef chooses the cheese for the board and selects complimentary meats.  YUMMY.... prices were average to a bit high but for the quality well worth it.  

Finished with the chocolate soufflé.... if you like chocolate (and who doesn't) ice cream and strawberries this dessert is for you.... this place is a repeat and I mean a weekly repeat. we all LOVED it... ambiance was good not too loud, and just enough business to make it fun."}
{"text":"so i recall when this place used to be down under wines a few years back. this is a pretty good place to relax after a long day at work or to bring a date for a nice romantic dinner and dessert, with great choices in french wine and champagne."}
{"text":"Best homemade and consistent restaurant in the valley. A hidden gem to say the least. Pictured is fresh hand cut fries with homemade tarter and homemade curry ketchup"}
{"text":"I typed in wine bar into the Yelp search and this place was the number one result. With 5 stars and 96 reviews I knew we had to try it. 

I am so glad we did. It was absolutely delicious. From the shrimp and chorizo appetizer, to the soft live music, not to mention the friendly server, this place was great. We had the filet and salmon as entrees and they were both to die for!

We will absolutely be back to introduce our friends!"}
{"text":"I've ordered creme brulee here before loved the girl who gave it to me to go. Ordered it again today and the lady was absolutely rude!! They made my fiance put the creme brulee in a to go box himself. I love the creme brulee but that service was just ridiculous. There is no need to be that rude. She was rude over the phone to me and to my fiancee in person. Than she had the audacity to give him a bad look when we didn't tip her. That's just not okay."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! what a hidden gem. It's honestly my new favorite restaurant in Gilbert, I almost don't want to write this review because then the secret will be out! My husband and I came on a recent Saturday evening and were surprised that they still do happy hour on Saturdays. We were able to enjoy discounted wine and $6 apps. yay! The food was delicious... we enjoyed the bruschetta board here much more than another Gilbert restuarant's bruschetta board (you know who im talking about...) 

They also had a two-man band playing some light classic rock hits. They were awesome! It wasn't too loud, and my husband and I could still carry on a conversation without having to yell over the band.

Service was excellent. Our server was there when we needed him and not over-bearing. Very friendly and prompt. 

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. LOVE IT! can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday celebration.. the food was good but couple of things that I do have to say negative about this restaurant is 1) the service was a little slow when we first got here 2) where we sat it just smelled like dirty rags.. I don't know if it was bc we sat close to the restroom but other then that this place wasn't bad.. they had live music which was nice and the ribeye we ordered was cooked perfectly.."}
{"text":"I think we ordered one of each appetizer plus the steak. It was super delicious and we left extremely happy and full.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"LOVE this new place! The escargot appetizer was succulent and rich, the meatballs were light and tasty with the mint yogurt sauce. For the entrees, too often salmon in the valley is plain, this was complex, with a wonderful sauce and sautéed onions and peppers. The quiche Lorraine had a wonderful, flakey crust and rich flavor, complemented by a mixed green salad with light balsamic dressing. The Belgian chocolate soufflé was heaven on earth. All complemented with excellent wines. A BIG upgrade over the former MWC, this is a MUST stop for wine and foodies in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I'm hoping they just had an off-night - the menu is very promising and it's a nice ambiance inside but it wasn't anything stellar on our visit.

The escargot was phenomenal. The chocolate souffle was decadent. The entrees fell pretty flat (especially given the price tag). Chicken cordon bleu was fairly dry inside & really needed some seasoning. The duck also needed some seasoning besides just peppercorn sauce. It was strange to just get a mound of french fries or a potato as your only side options.

The waitress was absolutely high. as. a. kite. I mean, I guess it's possible she wasn't... but it would shock me if she hadn't smoked a blunt before work.  I saw another table snickering as she walked away, so we must not have been the only ones to think so. 

It was amusing at first but then it got a bit annoying. She was overall quite slow with the service. She had to ask twice what wine I ordered, forgot my partner's wine entirely (though she did comp it), took my food to box it and never brought it back, and then upon trying to do the check asked a third time what wines we had both gotten. 

We might give it a shot again, hopefully it's better."}
{"text":"My band savoir-faire blues-rock performed last night here and once again it was an excellent experience. We dined last night here and I had the salmon again because it was so terrific the first time. As a performer they have treated me with the utmost respect and I would perform there anytime and it will remain one of our favorite eating places in the valley, or the world for that matter, as I have eaten on every continent."}
{"text":"A nice and beautiful place owned by a French family. 
Beers on tap, very nice wine list and an incredible menu! 
We shared three amazing bruschetta, very well done, outstanding bread; then the chorizo croquettes, a delightful piece of Spain; then their daily special, a duck quiche, homemade crust I can tell, very authentic and I can tell since I'm French too!
Highly recommended, staff is awesome and friendly, decoration is fabulous!
See you next time!"}
{"text":"Live music and warm decor make this a comfy wine restaurant and hang out.  Steak was fair fried Brie salad good."}
{"text":"Made reservations on Friday so my wife and I could go on Saturday at 5pm.  They asked if I wanted to sit close or far from live music that would start at 6pm.  Also asked if I wanted a high or low table.

We got escargot as an app.  They put a ton of garlic. I got salmon and wife got sword fish.  The plates were pretty and food was tasty.  Just not large portions.

For desert, we got this pastry with ice cream thing.  I was very good.  

Overall, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"The five stars I give here make me weep for the five stars I've given other places. My husband and I went here for a date night - we actually dressed up!  Well. Arizona summer dresses up. Anyway. Delish Pinot noir recommended by our server, Susie. Then the bruschetta - Brie, sausage and apple, and pesto - it was a progression from mild and smooth to strong and robust. Then the salad de chèvre. Beyond beyond. The chèvre on toast. The freshest of greens. A dressing that is perfect!  And bacon!  Then the quiche Lorraine. A special today. Never ever had quiche like this. And to top it off - the most decadent and perfect chocolate soufflé.  Perfect music. Perfect ambiance. Then! Live music. Acoustic guitar. By the time the co-owner and wife of the chef stopped to urge us to relax and enjoy the music - whilst telling us some of their family history (she's Irish he's French. 28 years together. Children and their spouses working there) we wanted to hug her and cry!  We were so grateful for this unexpected oasis. This haven. No pretentious foodies. No hipsters. No children (we love ours too - not on date night). We will be back. Often. Thank you to these Irish-French people for giving us this gift. 

Update:  we've come back twice since and both times have been disappointing. I love the jazz they usually have playing but live music in a small space means I can't hear my hubby and our chance to have a date night is why we are here. The other issue is the AC. I was sweating. It's hot outside. That's why I'm sitting inside. The AC needs to work. I don't care how many windows you have. I'll have to think carefully before returning. I wanted to be as enchanted as we were on our first visit. It hasn't been repeated."}
{"text":"The wine was great! We tried 4 different reds- the bottom 2 Cabs on the menu, H3 and the F. All were very good. Bruchetta: the ham and chicken are good. Salmon salad was delicious- the feta cheese contrasts well with the sweet strawberry. The salmon was tender & juicy. Yum! They had live music: Josh West, a father & son duo. They were perfect for the venue. Talented, smooth & we could still hear conversation at our table. We'll be back! Live music every Friday & Saturday."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the fried brie salad, and it was delicious.. maybe a tad over dressed. Our cheese plate was ok.. nothing spectacular.. deli style gouda, a wedge of brie, some goat, and a couple others. 

Our server was great, and so was the wine!

My beef was with the meat I ordered.. get it?! beef! 

My duck was waaaayyy well done, though I ordered rare... then I feel like the chef knew it was toast, and drowned it in sauce. No Bueno. My wife woman says her filet was good though.

The duck got comped... Live music set a fresh mood inside. Lil thang playing acoustic guitar and singing mostly 90s stuff. Cranberries, and stuff like that. Coffee on the patio after dinner was dope as a mug. 

I said I probably would not re visit, but wifey says she wants to go back soon. I will just steer clear of the duck next time."}
{"text":"Was here last evening and had a very enjoyable time.  The music entertainment was well suited for the venue, our server was knowlegable, attentive, friendly.  We enjoyed the mixed board (plenty for 2) and a wonderful bottle of Gamay Bougolais."}
{"text":"I've driven by Cuisine & Wine Bistro on several occasions over the last three years and am so mad that it took me this long to walk in and discover the magic and beauty that is within this hidden gem!

My husband and I decided to give this place a try and fell in love the minute we walked in. It is intimate, inviting and romantic with a french inspired menu and many different wine options. The whole menu looks delicious so we had to consul with our waitress and she was so sweet. She checked on us frequently, provided recommendation and made sure that we enjoyed our food. 

We ordered the escargot, bone marrow special and duck entree. I personally am not the biggest fan of bone marrow or escargot, but my husband couldn't stop raving about both dishes. That being said, the duck entree has to be one of the best dinner entrees I've had in the East Valley and in a long time, period! I'm so happy that this place is right down the street because I will be visiting frequently!

They also have live music so be sure to check that out. I know I will!"}
{"text":"Omg!! The bruschetta and croquettes?! Amazeballs!! The wine selection is huge and Killian knows his s***. My new wine bar for sure!!"}
{"text":"Truly a gem.  The food is delicious, the live music on Friday nights added a wonderful ambiance.  We had the ribeye platter, the chorizo croquettes and they were both scrumptious and the ribeye is a very large portion.  The fromage (cheese) and Charcuterie (meat) boards had a varied selection and the presentation was impeccable.  We said it was our first time, a very nice lady explained she was the owner, because of her accent I asked where she was from and she explained her family is from France.  Her family owns the restaurant and that her son is the Chef and some of the waitresses were her daughters.  She was very nice and was super apologetic about the service taking longer than expected.  So here's my opinion of this....this is NOT a fast food restaurant.  It is a charming one of a kind bistro, to stop by, enjoy amazing made from scratch food while having a glass of wine and listening to live music.  I'd take this over fast food any time!  It was very good!"}
{"text":"Very very good. It's got a nice relaxed vibe and the food is amazing. Super delicious."}
{"text":"Wow!  We met at this place for a dinner night out with fiends and it was exceptional.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgable (she came complete with a French accent!).  We had an assortment of bruchetta for an appetizer, then I had swordfish and my wife had the fillet.  Both were exceptional!  So good we stuck around for desert, which we normally don't do.  Strawberry tart and creme brule were the final compliment to a great meal.  Live music in the background provided a nice ambiance without interfering with the conversation.  Loved it and will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and each time has been great! This past Friday, my girlfriends and I sat on the patio and enjoying the beautiful March weather in AZ. Our waiter Jesse was awesome! He was intentive, informed about the different wines, very nice and funny! He added to our fun night! This is hidden gem! Oh and their bruchetta is so delish!"}
{"text":"This place has reviews that are unbelievable... We went to the bistro and our meal was so delicious it was shocking!! The waitress even made sure that she knew how long we were wanting to stay there so if we wanted a long meal she was happy to give it to us! The blue cheese pesto bruschetta was so delicious! We will definitely be back.. Too bad they aren't open for brunch!"}
{"text":"10 stars! This bistro is beyond wonderful. Every single bite of every thing we ordered was superb. I lived in France for 14 years and this place is even better than any restaurant I can remember in Europe. My husband's steak was perfection, the salmon bruschetta was absolutely delicious, and my evening special, a kind of shepherd's pie, was so mouth watering-ly delicious I kept eating long after I really could hardly take another bite. Oh, and the crème brûlée was a special treat- better than any other crème brûlée I have ever tasted. In fact, the food was so delicious we really didn't have a dinner conversation! Pretty much everything we talked about concerned how amazing our food was. I'm in town for three days, and I can't wait for my next two dinners at this place. I seriously do not want to go anywhere else. The only thing that could make this place better would be if they opened up a clone restaurant in Orange County, California, where I live! Truly, this is a MUST TRY bistro!"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance is fantastic. So nice to walk into a Gilbert restaurant with no wait. This is a family run restaurant that features French food. The chef is French has has cooked and had restaurants for many year and his expertise shows. Had the Escargot special that was amazing, hint of garlicky with pesto and tomatoes. Just melted in your mouth. The Fromage Board with a chef selection of cheeses was ample and had excellent cheeses. This place is a 10!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice already and my experience has always been delightful. I am new to French cuisine and I admire the authenticity, considering the owners are from France. The staff is very friendly and willing to explain and/or recommend their dishes and wines. 

The mango chutney with the fried cheese croquettes appetizer is an absolute stunner and so are their desserts (souffle and creme brulee). I always find their main course portions huge, which is good because I have leftovers for my next meal. Always a good thing when I can enjoy my meal twice. 

They have live music at times, which is a nice touch. Overall, this is a beautiful restaurant with good food - ideal for a date night, or just catching up with friends over food and wine.

I am definitely coming back to try to escargot some day!!"}
