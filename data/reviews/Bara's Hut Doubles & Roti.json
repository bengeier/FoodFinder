{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years. I have introduced friends from all backgrounds to Baras doubles and have seen girls knees buckle when they took the first bite of doubles. It may not be the swankiest ambiance but their food will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Love the doubles, roti, goat, and aloo pie so much. I love their pholourie that comes with tamarind sauce. The sauce is made perfectly. I usually get takeout and the service is very fast, maybe 3-5 minutes wait, sometimes less. The people there are friendly. After years, I haven't been disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"The people are friendly. The rotis are big fat and juicy. It's hard to eat a whole one but you'll do it because it's so delicious. The doubles are delicious and you'll find other Trinidad stuff like current rolls and delicious curry mango. I have also had the awesome eggplant choka. Love the food here."}
{"text":"I had the double and the double w/ chicken. My only issue was that the food falls apart WAY too easily and is really hard to eat because of the thin crepe-like outside. Other than that it was DELICIOUS and full of all kinds of flavor! The woman working was also super friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best doubles in mississauga in my humble opinion.   They even have goat doubles for $3.50 which is also amazing.  Great tasting pepper sauce which isn't too over the top spicy for me at least.    Always fresh when ordered which is important for doubles.  Comes out crispy, hot and greasy.  Never a long wait either.  Lots of parking most of the time."}
