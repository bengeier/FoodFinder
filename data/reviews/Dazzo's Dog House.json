{"text":"Over 30 years ago I stopped at Dazzo's. When I got there it was closed. Two men( the Dazzo's brothers, Ron and Frank) were working inside, one of them came to the door and said \"sorry we're closed, come back tomorrow, that's when we officially open\". So my wife, my Mom and I came back the next day and we have been going to Dazzo's since. We've literally have seen the Dazzo's family grow up; their kids and now there grand kids. I love hot dogs and crazy about their beefs and and sausage sandwich, ( you know sweet and hot peppers and real, real, real wet). Even though we moved a bit farther from their location we still make it a point to stop in and grab a bite to eat. Without question there is no other place like Dazzo's in the Valley. As always best wishes the Dazzo family and lets do another 30 more years."}
{"text":"If you want a dog and are in the area, this is a pretty good call. Having said that, it is probably not worth a special trip. You can find a better hot dog or brat at a ballpark or in the supermarket."}
{"text":"Place was crowded at first.  Near a high school I hear, so must get a lot of school lunch crowd.  We ordered a little after 1pm and service was fast.  Parking is very limited.  No Alcohol or restrooms.  Place was a little warm (was 107 outside). No free refills on drinks and no restrooms.  Brother ordered a \"Chubby Dog\" which was not that chubby, but tasted good.  Fries were good.  I ordered Italian beef.  Seemed a little overpriced at $5.50.  Was more like a $3.50 - $4.00 sandwich.  But, it did taste good.  All things considered, I rate it a little above average for your fast food places.  Menu did seem to have good burger prices, but I went there for the Italian beef so didn't try one of their burgers.  One of the customers there told me to try Portillo/s, off Shea near 90th street.  She said it was the best Chicago in the valley.  Will give it a try some time soon.

Overall... If you are in the neighborhood, you might enjoy.  Just bring only cash and hit a restroom before you get here."}
{"text":"Hit the drive thru on Thursday with the daughter on our way to run some errands, since the dining area was closed do to the car driving thru the building. 

As we are from Chicago, I have to say that the dog was almost perfect. The bun was steamed the right way and the dog was cooked perfectly, the only problem is the relish that is used here. It is just too sweet and it throws off the taste of the sandwich. But as far as the south side version of a Chicago Dog goes, it is pretty good. 

Next time I go there, I will have to try the beef."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! Chicago dog was good... And for around 3 bucks, with fries!
Gotta go back to try the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"I totally agree with what Ryan C. said. I am not a huge hot dog person either, and Dazzo's is one of the only places I get excited about getting a hot dog from. I can't speak for any of their other menu items, as every time I go there I just have to have the regular hot dog with everything. I got introduced to them from my husband, who has been going there since he was a kid. 

The last time I went (yesterday) there was a young man working at the counter. He was friendly and professional. There were seven of us and our entire order was hot and fresh, and correct. The fries were so good! One of us got a hamburger (the rest of us hot dogs) and he said that was excellent too.

I don't get out to the Old Glendale area often, but when I do I always want to go to Dazzo's!"}
{"text":"Been going to Dazzo's from the very beginning they opened up. In the later 1970's. Can't remember exactly.  I've worked for some big hot dog places in Chicago in the 1960's. Some of those places in Chicago don't even compare. Dazzo's is family owned. Dazzo's has the best French fries, Italian Beef, ices, Hot Dogs in the west Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for a long time and am so glad I stopped by! The food was amazing, the brat was super and the fries were so fresh! We will definitely be back, probably very soon! The staff could not have been more helpful with their suggestions. It is cash only and there is no bathroom inside so keep that in mind if you eat there. They can bag up the food to go or they do have a drive thru"}
{"text":"Best place ever!!!! I have been coming here for years.  Great prices and FANTASTIC food.  But it is more than the food, the staff are something else. They are friendly and nice people, one of the many joys to a family owned business is they know you, remember you, and make you feel awesome for supporting their business. My last meal would be Dazzo's! Not one bad item on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing dogs and perfectly greasy fries. Would only be better if there was a dining room."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to get a Chicago dog in Phoenix. Great food, even better staff. Cash only though so bring your money!"}
{"text":"Been going here for around 20 years they have the best Chicago dogs and fries ever and italian ices and the staff is always kind."}
{"text":"Best Dogs in Glendale and maybe even all of Phoenix.
I come here as often as I can... CASH ONLY though so make sure to bring cash or be ready to use the ATM machine inside."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this joint.  I have been visiting this place for years and have never experienced anything except a hot, correct, and flavorful order.  All of the dogs have the price of fries included which keeps the price of the meals reasonable.  No matter what my budget I will not leave hungry.  Their counter service is fast.  The service is friendly.  I am a big fan of the Italian Beef Sandwich.  I have been known to go in just to get an Italian Ice when I am in the mood for a cold treat.  There is an on site ATM to offset their cash only atmosphere.

Lack of a place for me to wash my hands is the only thing keeping this place from getting a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Chicago themed place, Bears, Cubs, etc... Their dogs and Italian beef are are very good. The fries are especially great. Especially when you get a chubby chilli dog to go and they wrap everything together. When you get home you have chilli fries..... :D. The Lemon Italian Ice is the way to go in the summer, cold, crisp, and refreshing with pieces of lemon."}
{"text":"The best hot dogs this side of Chicago ...trust me ive tried them all and this place does it right ... even wraps the fries up with the dog the right way !  This place is real deal ...italian beef ...brats ...polish sausage .... Cash only and no restrooms just like it would be in Chi town !!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying there. They recommended the popular Italian Beef sub. I got it with sweet peppers and onions. It was one one of the best sandwich I've had in a long time. What made the sandwich good is the beef juice they pour over the sub. It made the bread soggy and that's the best part ! The employees are very friendly, courteous, and thoughtful. They came to check on me to make sure I'm happy w my meal. I'm definitely going back there again soon. Bring cash only. The prices are reasonable. Hot dogs group includes fries while subs group doesn't."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming here for over a decade. I don't think anything has changed except for some new memorabilia over the years. I can honestly say that I've had atleast one of everything on the menu. My regular is hot beer, fries, pizza puff, and a cola. I couldn't suggest any one thing though because everything was good. Cash only. But it's worth the stop at an atm."}
{"text":"By no means am I a hot dog person, or at the very least I am extremely picky when it comes to them.  Dazzo's is easily one of the few places I can think of where I am actually excited to get a hot dog.  I don't believe I have had a bad regular hot dog there, I get them everything (mustard, onions, relish, and sport peppers).  The fire dogs are hit and miss at times, and the fries and tamales can be as well.  The Italian beef is also quite enjoyable and one of the other items I enjoy on a regular basis.  I must have gotten one of the older employees the last few times I went, as I had not experienced the poor food quality discussed by some of the other users.

The location itself is in an old area and the place itself is very old, but it is not really that sketchy in my book.  There are far worse places I can think of going in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Greats dogs, their other food is good but I always get 2 dogs, nice fries too!

I have been going there since 1979-1980?

Bring cash, no cards

Buy the relish & sport peppers to bring home for partys"}
{"text":"Best Chicago dogs in town ! And the Italian beef is real good , these place has been here for along time and has some history to it , also only reason for 4 stars is there cash only which sucks"}
{"text":"Ok, so there is no place in the valley I would go for a hot dog OTHER than Dazzo's.  They've been making the best dogs in town for decades.  

That said, their pricing is a bit higher than it should be, they STILL won't take credit/debit cards (by far my biggest complaint), and the best way to enjoy the food is through the drive through, because your car will be more comfortable than the sitting areas they provide.

Nevertheless, I give them 4 starts because the food is about as good as a dog can get!"}
{"text":"Chicago style??!! Ummmm NOOOO lol I was so dissapoonted ordered the cheesy beef got my beef with cheese sauce on it and the beef had no flavor and the staff was so rude. The place is decorated cute with all chicago team stuff which was cool reminded me of home but no I'll pass"}
{"text":"Dropped by Dazzo's before a hockey game the other night.  I heard good things and had read about that car that crashed into the wall forcing the dining area to close for some time.  After a long wait I was finally here and I was not disappointed.

Initially, I had gone in for a hot dog but ended up ordering the Italian Beef sandwich.  I spent 10 years in Chicagoland and the Italian beef sandwich has been one of the things I miss most aside from friends.  The owners son, working the counter, told me flat out they had a great beef sandwich.  That was enough for me.  

As my order was in the works I chatted with the owners son and another guy working.  We talked hockey, hot dogs and about the car wreck that destroyed the wall.  Great, friendly people.

When my food was ready I sat down and dug in.  The beef sandwich was great an on par with those I had in Chicago.  It was made just right, the juice was tasty and the beef and bread were great.  The hot peppers made a great touch (you can also go for sweet peppers or none at all).  Dazzo's makes good fries too.

Dazzo's is a fantastic mom and pop restaurant.  The food is great and the workers are friendly.  You can't go wrong.  Dazzo's is a must.  Put Dazzo's on your \"to do\" list if you have not been here before.  I will back.  No doubt."}
{"text":"Cash only.  Food incredibly greasy the whole bottom of the brown bag they gave me was soaked with grease."}
{"text":"Bring cash and don't expect a bathroom or a place to wash your hands. I work in some dirty environments and needed to #1 when I showed here for lunch, was surprised to find NONE of the above mentioned, apparently luxuries, when I ordered lunch. Decent food but no where to wash your hands or pee if ya gotta go. Where does the staff go, and wash their hands? No clue!!!"}
{"text":"I moved back to Az from Chicago in August and I've been craving a beef something fierce! I was too excited when I found this place! This Italian beef was delish, fries were on point. They've gained a new customer for sure."}
{"text":"How has no one else reviewed this place? Wow.

Well I have only been once or twice so I am not the dazzo's expert, but I remember it being pretty awesome. 

Kosher dogs and hamburgers. Fries. Chili. All the goodies on top you can imagine. Seriously amazingly tasty. Located in the ghetto, really tiny parking lot, but worth it. 

Someone else who is more knowledgable should come review Dazzo's!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go,  Cash only,  no restrooms,  but amazing chili cheese dogs. Went with hubby every once in awhile.  Price not bad about 12 to 13 for both of us.  Fries are good especially when u dip it into the extra chilli cheese that falls. My hubby got chubby dog and he loved it."}
{"text":"Italian Beef was good as were the fries. The highlight was the homemade Italian Ices. Good place for lunch and prices were not bad. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian Ice in AZ. The Polish dogs are really good too.  My mom brought my siblings and I here when we were small & I can bring my kiddo here to enjoy now."}
{"text":"tastey italian beef combo has replaced firedogs when i go, but never disappointed with any feasting i have done here. worth the trip, not open on sunday."}
{"text":"We went to the drive in movie theater in Glendale and were driving around looking for somewhere to eat. This place came up on yelp app and had some good ratings so we decided to try it out. I must say the chubby fire dogs were delicious that we ordered. I LOVED the taste of the relish! We also got a pizza puff I think it was called...I apologize if I have the name of that wrong...but it was pretty decent. ..little on the greasy side and seemed to have a lot of breading compared to filling...I liked the dog better....while we were waiting we tried a little sample of the Italian beef sandwich I believe it was and OMG that was the winner right there! AMAZING!!! I will definitely be back someday and will be ordering that versus the chubby fire dog again. I've never had a real \"new york\" hot dog as everyone raves about so I feel I really cant compare it...but this dog was pretty darn tasty :)"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and always pleased with everything.  The fact that this place has been in business for as many years as it has speaks volumes that they are doing it right."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Dazzo's so long that the people waiting on me were not even born when I first ate there, I now drive all the way from Prescott for a hot dog and their great fries, its the best. And as far as that new hot dog joint in Scottsdale from Chicago, it is like getting a hot dog at a Walmart or a gas station. Dazzo's has great family employees. It is only 102 miles from my house, I drop in all the time.

{"text":"One of the best places in the Glendale/Phoenix area for delicious hot dogs and fantastic French fries! The only downside to this place is no restrooms and cash only. However, the food makes up for this minor inconvenience. 
The \"spicy dog\" is especially noteworthy..."}
{"text":"Classic neighborhood dogs. The original fast food.  More options than a hot dog stand, but not many."}
{"text":"This place is great, I always get the jumbo dog and I love how they come with fries. Oh did I mention the fries are awesome here. 

Make sure you order the dog with everything plus peppers. 

Also cash only."}
{"text":"This was the last stop on our Chicago Dog marathon with my Dad. We went to four different places and this was the furthest away from our house. It's literally on the other side of the tracks.

Ordered  a Chubby Fire Dog and a Chubby Chile Dog with Cheese and Onions. My Dad went with a basic Chicago Dog and a side of Onion Rings. All the Dogs come with their fresh hand cut french fries and they have most of the condiments that you see in your typical Chi-town hot dog joint.

The service here is friendly and the food was pretty good. I seemed to like mine more than my Dad's selection. He said his was a bit soggy and did not live up to his standards. I was just plain hungry and gobbled mine up in a heartbeat. Burp!

This is a no thrill restaurant with a good selection of what you would see in the Windy City. There is plenty of cool things hanging on the wall and a neat history behind what they have been doin here for many decades. The parking lot is also painted with several of the Chicago team's logos and made it fun when parking the car. 

Looking forward to trying out an Italian Beef next time and maybe even giving the condiments a better look over. I could of sworn that they had pepper juice in one of the squirt bottles. JUICE ME BABY!

{"text":"Awesome if you're not into eating healthy. Split a cheeseburger and chili dog with a friend. Portions weren't outrageous, price was great but fries were soggy."}
{"text":"I tried 3 different dogs and fire dog was my favorite. Love the fresh cut fries. Pineapple shaved ice was also very delicious."}
{"text":"Cool treat! I decided to treat my daughter to something cool: Pineapple Italian Ice. Dazzo's homemade Italian Ice comes in a variety of sizes: small (8 oz, $1.95), medium ($2.20). We got the medium. They have a large and jumbo size. I am sorry that I didn't remember the sizes. Their Italian Ice is sweet and tangy. In this hot desert, it is great to have access to delicious and chilled desserts."}
{"text":"This is just crap!!! White things will eat just any s h i t!!

La Pasadita has way better hotdogs, no comparison here!!!

Cash only piece of s h i t place!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty average at best.  I'm a HUGE fan of Italian beef and this is probably the worst I've had.  It wasn't spoiled, or rotten or anything to be disgusted about but it just wasn't good.  The fries were great, the Chicago dogs were average, no better than gas station food.  For the price, drive to Portillo's, you WON'T regret it."}
{"text":"The absolute best Chicago italian beef sandwich outside of Chicago bar none - i have been all over the valley trying to find anything that comes close to the real thing and Dazzo's is the only place that gets it right!"}
{"text":"Just okay. I think there are better spots in Phoenix to get a Chicago style hot dog."}
{"text":"I would give it a -1000..... why you ask ... well they where super busy and rude to some black customers next was some straight up \"WOODS\" white people and they were nice and also gave them the food first .... 

Well I guess I know why they always have attitude with me .... because I'm Mexican .... 

Well this is my last time here .... yup for real I done with this place ...."}
{"text":"This place is a definite \"A-OK\" for hot dogs and fries. Friendly people at the counter, and the '50s Chicago theme is a nice nostalgic touch.  I'd come here again for getting my hot dog fix if I find myself in the Glendale area, but it doesn't have enough draw to make me drive there from my area in central Phoenix.."}
{"text":"This is a local place that may parents were told about. They have been around for awhile. Walking in they have pretty cool decor. Lots of pictures and the walls are mostly covered with them. Inside it's pretty small. There are six tables to sit at with about three more outside. The menu is old school with plastic letters and words. Prices are not too bad and they have a good selection of items.

The parking area is really small but you can park on the side street (not the Main Street).

One of the biggest things is that they only take cash. If you don't have cash they do have an ATM for you to pull out cash but you will be hit with a transaction fee.

Come and try this place out! Their food is really good! The hot dogs come with fries. I want to come back sometime to try out more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best chili dogs out there! I have been coming here a couple decades now! They will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at Dazzo's. I could close my eyes and imagine that I was back in Chicago. The Italian beef and Sausage is top notch. So are the Polish sausages and Hot Dogs."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I really can't complain about anything. Dazzos was everything I expected to be and more. I ordered a chilli cheese dog with fries and a pizza puff(curiousity). The chilli cheese dog was awesome, great chilli! The homemade fries where fresh and hot. The pizza puff which I ordered out of curiosity just to see what it was like wasn't bad at all... more of a homemade pizza pocket. I would definitely recommend if you like good food and a low key place."}
{"text":"Won't recommend going here again, sloppy food and not well maintained.  If ur from a different race like African American ,Hispanic, Chinese, u won't get great service. Js...  their rude and shitty customer service..."}
{"text":"I had high expectation from this place based off of all the positive review on here. The fries were good, I like how they left the skin on like at in-n-out. The dogs were nothing special, couldn't really tell the difference between a dog here and a custom made one from QT down the street. I may come back a time or two to try the other stuff. I'm not giving up on this place, not just yet!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of this place.  Cash only.  He hotdogs are Vienna hotdogs.  Nothing special.  I ordered a hot beer dog and it was dry, the bun soggy.  The fries were also soggy and the staff is unfriendly.  You can go to the grocery store and buy Vienna hotdogs and make them at home much better."}
{"text":"Great dogs and great fries.
This is a very good place for Chicago Style Hot Dogs with fresh home made French Fries.
Everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Hotdog shop ever! Great food expecially the Chubby Firedog, add Giardinare a for a real treat. The people are awesome and so friendly. So make sure and tip them.."}
{"text":"Very good hot dogs. Not you usual QT OR CIRCLE K type fyi. I like their chili dog and fire dog. I just wished you could get the hot dog with out fries st times and maybe be less expensive. Overall great hot dogs. Have yet to try other menu items"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a hot dog joint just like you would find in any neighborhood in Chicago. Nothing fancy, family owned and run, proud Chicago heritage, and good, authentic Chicago food. The hot dogs are my favorite in the whole valley; the Italian beef is well done as is the Italian sausage and Polish. When I walk in here, I feel like I'm back home. They have the pizza puffs, remember those? And the Chicago tamale too!
And the other Chicago thing....Cash only. Gotta love it. You gotta go!"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely wonderful service! Really delicious food! The Italian ice is really good too! Family friendly, my autistic daughter even loved it and she's very particular! I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of the great things about living in the southwest, is how all the food traditions have followed us here. 

Want a Philly Cheesesteak? Forgetaboutit!  New Yawk deli? We've got dat too!  A Chicago dog? Abs-so-freakin-lootely! LOL  How about that Aaron Rogers and George Wendt commercial?  Grill Class, I love it!  

It seems Chicago style, Vienna Beef places are all over greater Phoenix. What you don't see too often, are these family owned places. In Chicago you have Mom and Pop places all over. Each one trying to create their own piece of heaven for their loyal customers. 

Well I believe Dazzo's is one of those places too. You come in, you are greeted by one of the Dazzo family members. Warmly! None of that phony baloney stuff. Just, \"thanks for coming in!  First time here?  Where are you from?\"  They also have family pictures all over the wall, going back to when they first opened. Nice! 

And if UR interested, they also have a nice collection Chicago team Sun Times clippings, mostly of the Bulls and Cubs stuff. 

Okay, this is all great Georgie, but what makes it so special?  Well, the food!  Grilled Jumbo Dogs, Red Hots, Fire Dogs, Brats, Italian Beef -- they have them all and they're cooked fresh, just for you. Delicious!

Another plus are their French fries. They're exquisite and topped with a nice mixture of seasoning salt. I'm not a big fries guy, but I might come back for some more of them. 

But when I do come back, I'll bring more Cash because they don't accept Plastic. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here with my boyfriend a couple of times... I love the Chicago Dogs... So yummy and my favorite.... If anyone wants a yummy Chicago Dog go here..."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in the city. The brats, Polish, and chili dogs are all great choices. The fries are good; not too salty. The staff is always friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Happened to be driving by & this caught my attention. My chili cheese dog craving was needing to be filled.  We each ordered their beef chili cheese dog which came with fries & also an order of onion rings. Hot dog was barely warm, chili was very flavorful but I just really don't enjoy almost cold hot dogs.  I used the leftover chili/cheese to dip my fries in which was pretty good! Not planning on rushing back here, we just weren't \"wowed\""}
{"text":"One of the local mom and pop shops I like to eat at when I'm under $6, often getting the Polish Dog Combo, which is a Chicago style Polish Dog with Fries. Bring Cash because they don't take debit. I like bring a packet of Cream Cheese to add to my Polish Dog, and a packet of ketchup for my fries. Inside has a lot of interesting local sports memorabilia to look at if you are in to that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Cash only place.  Lucky for us, we had cash!  My 2 little girls were in the mood for hot dogs, so we checked it out.  My 3 year old got a hot dog, and my 6 year old got the jumbo dog.  She seemed pleased with herself that she was getting the jumbo dog.  I decided to go with the Italian beef with spicy peppers.

Each item was to come with fries, but there was no differentiating between the fries servings, it was like they did 3 scoops of fries on top of the dogs and sandwich.  The Italian beef leaked all over the bag and almost broke the bag.  I asked for 2 smaller bags and divided the food between the 3 of us.  I burned my hands on the fries, they were that fresh.  There was about a handful of fries (big handful) for each sandwich.  They were salty, and very tasty, I wish there were more.

My kids loved the hot dogs.  My 6 year old was bummed the jumbo wasn't bigger.  The Italian beef was flavorful and tasty.  The man working the window gave my girls lollipops.  It was a little spendy when compared to Weinerschnitzel and Costco, but I like going to mom and pop places more than chains."}
{"text":"Omg... The best chili cheese dog I've ever had. The bae took me here because it's one of his favorite places and it's definitely became mine too. I highly recommend the Italian ice (we got the horchata and lemon) and they're both very good!!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I recently discovered this joint and we've been back several times since. DELICIOUS doesnt aptly describe it! The italian ice has a creamier texture to it which I havent been able to find in years and the italian beef is just crazy good. Havent had a bad thing off the menu yet."}
{"text":"Dazzo's is not located in the ghetto !  Its located at 63rd Ave & Glendale right across the street from Glendale High School you know the school that has been there for nearly a 100 years ?

Dazzo's alone has been there nearly if not more than 30 years so folks that should give you an idea of the area where this place is located.  Its an older part of Glendale and nothing less and its completely safe.

Nonetheless, this place has the best food in town when it comes to hot dogs, hamburgers and anything else you crave Chicago style.  My favorite meal is the polish sausage with cheese, ketchup and onion served with fries for less than four bucks !  

Over the years I have tried their hot dogs, chili dogs, burritos, hamburgers except for the Italian Sausage / Beef but I will eventually do so one day.

The Italian Ice is the best and the soda's are always fresh.  You get one refill of your soda for like 50 cents.  Only cash is accepted.  Its a very small successful family restaurant so you can see why they would only accept cash.  They clearly post outside before you enter that they only accept cash as well.

If your in the area for business, work, family, friends or driving through the part of Glendale for a ballgame Dazzo's is a must.

They are open Mon-Sat 1030AM to 8PM and closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"This place was awesome,  great customer service. They gave us a sample of the beef sandwich and I'm almost disappointed that I didn't order one. The chilli dogs and fries and onion rings were great too.  We will definitely be repeat customers there."}
{"text":"Just ate here for first time with my wife - loved it! Chili dog for her and a Chubby dog for me, plus we split a pizza puff. All delicious, especially the fries that came with the hot dogs. We then got takeout for another family member. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best and most authentic Chicago Italian Beef on a Vienna roll with gravy in all of the Phoenix area!
I did a Yelp search, read the reviews and drove to the restaurant.  They have been in Glendale for 30 years."}

The gentleman who took my phone call offered to put all their veggie toppings on a bun for me. While I appreciate the offer it was not what I was in search of. I hope you get some Veg friendly options soon, Dazzo's!"}
{"text":"Best Italian Beef in Phoenix.  They will dip your sandwich in the meat broth, just like in Chi-town.  The Italian Beef combo with the sausage.... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  Historic Glendale.  Go there.  Eat.  Be happy."}
{"text":"Short Story

Small, not fancy, cash only, no restroom or hand cleaning station. Chicago Style Dogs and Food.  Tasty Italian Beef Sandwiches and hand cut Fries. Low Prices BIG Portions. FAST!

Longer Story

Dazzo's Dog House appears to be a much loved place of Glendale for Chicago Style Vienna Beef Dogs and other foods. They've been around for decades and I witnessed customers sharing stories about Dazzo's here. The Tiny casual restaurant also is decorated with an assortment of memorabilia and fun antiques including an autographed Alice Cooper Guitar. We placed our order and sat ourselves near the flashing traffic light. Within a minute or two our order was called. 

I tried the Italian Beef with Giardiniera. The beef was very tender and very developed with flavor. The bread was a sponge that was soaked with all that beefy goodness and the spicy vegetable topping just made the sandwich pop in my mouth in all the right places. The sandwich is very large and comes with a foil liner so you can bring some home for a snack later if you want.

My husband ordered far more food than he could eat but wanted to try The Fire Dog and the combo sandwich. He liked the dog and the combo sandwich but the dog and sausage come deep-fried slightly more well done than he likes so he would stick with Italian Beef next time. Fries come with all the hotdogs and they are made fresh hand cut in house. The fries were tasty and good.

They make Home Made Italian Water ice! I don't know of anyplace else on the westside offers that! The Water Ice is a Creamy kind of style I'm not familiar with perhaps it's a Chicago Style? Honestly I didn't care for the water ice but that's just me and I'm not holding that against them.

Currently a grade \"A\" Maricopa Sign is posted by ordering station.

I'm not really into a ton of toppings on my hot dogs (I mean, just give me the wiener without all the bells and whistles), and they still serve the best hot dog with ketchup only in the Valley. 

Since the fries only compliment the dog, I'm not going to go too hard on them. They really aren't the main event, and they are still decent. 

Make sure you bring cash or Dazzo's will refuse you the frank."}
{"text":"Moved to Phoenix a few months ago and finally tried this place. Hot dog was ok but I want to go back and try some other items. The French fries however were absolutely awesome! The place is small and cash only so be prepared and schedule so you can find a seat or be prepared to get it to go. No public bathrooms so go before you go. Lots of old school sports memorabilia, mainly Chicago related but it's still cool."}
{"text":"Came here today with the Ol' dad after a couple days of spring training games. I fell in love with Chicago last year, & what's more Chicago than a hot wet Italian beef sandwich loaded with sweet & hot peppers?! Love at first bite, the place is a small family owned, cash only business. It's old school and I love it. Nothing fancy, just good ol' Chicago eats! I didn't experience rude customer service, actually quite the opposite. I will be back in a couple of weeks to share this gem with my husband. We love our Italian Beef, and this place does it right. Oh, and their chili cheese fries were amazing also."}
{"text":"Always hits the spot!  Their french fries and Italian ice.. yum!"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER** I am not a big fan of hot dogs but I had a craving while out with a friend and I inhaled my meal.  Had we not gone through the drive through I could have gone back for seconds.  I ordered a Chicago dog and for about five minutes was in hot dog heaven.  The downside of Dazzo's is that they are cash only but if you are in the mood to nom nom nom down on some delicious cylindrical meats, consider making the trip to Dazzo's."}
{"text":"4 hot dogs and some cheese fries costed nearly 18 bucks. CASH ONLY. The dogs themselves were not the large \"beef\" dogs that you could get at a baseball game, rather small and skinny. Moral of the story, for 18 bucks, I can buy \"6\" packages of Oscar Meyer Beef Franks and have 48 hot dogs."}
{"text":"These hot dogs were gooood and I don't particularly care for hot dogs.  I had a chubby: mustard, grilled onions, peppers and fries. Damn it was good. I couldn't finish it though.  We split some onion rings and they were too greasy.  The dipping sauce for the onion rings was rare like all-the-condiments-in-the-fridge-mixed-together kind of rare. 

Don't get a chubby in the car.  Don't take your chubby home. Get a chubby there and eat it there."}
{"text":"Stopped by Dazzo's today for a quick bite on my way through Glendale.  I didn't have time to stop in so I did drive thru.  Dazzo's is a little greasy spoons that serves some great hot dogs, burgers and sandwiches.  They are locally owned and have been around a while, with plenty of local fans.

On my first trip to Dazzo's I got their Brat with sauerkraut and mustard with a side of fries.  The Brat was good and so were the fries, so I was looking forward to today's drive through experience especially after reading Andrew G's review.

Today I got their Big Dog with fries and a drink.  The service was not the same on this trip as what I experienced before.  The guy that took my order seemed OK and was very quick.  In fact I think he was a little too quick.  My Big Dog and fires were wrapped up in a very small brown bag.  I took Andrew's advise and \"let it rest\" for about ten min while I drove to my destination.  While unwrapping my hot dog and fry package I noticed everything was all smooshed together.  This made for a great smell-o-roma, but it was not very pleasing to eat.  Nothing worse than a smooshed hot dog bun with all the delicious toppings falling off the dog.  

My recommendation when visiting Dazzo's ~ don't be rushed, stop by and enjoy a tasty hot dog at their place and don't go through the drive thru.  No one should have ever to eat a smooshed hot dog!"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent, nothing I have tried is bad. I love eating here! The Italian Beef is amazing, the Chicago Dog's rock and the fries are amazing! Don't wait eat here today!"}
{"text":"I've never heard of french fries being cooked in a lard before I would've never known had I not read a review on the wall being vegan I ordered fries thinking I was safe I admit I probably should've asked how they were prepared but I did not."}
{"text":"Dazzo's Dog House is a great family owned joint. Small, dingy, and been around for years. I have eaten here several times as it isn't far from my office. They are known best for there Italian beef but I have grown fond of there burger and fries. The burger is charred on a grill that must have decades of seasoning in it from years of use. The fries are fresh cut and tender. I love the HOT Brat. Makes my nose run. 

They also have home made shaved Italian ice. The lemon is not to tart or to sweet and you can actually see part of the lemon zest in it. I have also had the strawberry and it too was tasty. 

Over all the prices are also something I come back for. Hamburger $1.50, Dog with fries $3.50, Italian ice $1.25. I can get 1 burger, fries, large wild cherry Pepsi, and Italian ice for like 5 bucks. 

The Italian beef is good but it isn't really my thing. I'll stick with the burgers and dogs."}
{"text":"As a native of Chicago I can tell you I know Chicago food, and I am embarrassed to have to even admit I ate lunch here. This place is a joke! I have never, ever, ever had a Chicago dog without a pickle spear or a tomato wedge, they didn't ever have celery salt on them!!  After questioning the elderly lady who took our order as to why our Chicago dogs with everything had no pickle or tomato and informing her (I didn't really have to, I could tell by her accent she is from Chicagoland) that they should, she tells me.....are you ready for this???? She tells me it depends on what part of Chicago your from!!!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS? Come on lady, if your going to represent Chi town.....DO IT RIGHT!

A Chicago-style hot dog, Chicago Dog, or Chicago Red Hot is an Vienna all-beef frankfurter on a poppy seed bun, originating from the city of Chicago, Illinois. The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, bright green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices or wedges, pickled sport peppers and a dash of celery salt.

\"Chicago Style\""}
{"text":"Found myself without lunch one day a couple of weeks ago and decided to send my help out to this place.  I had the Italian beef sandwich and fries.  Total came to $7.51 with tax.  Other than telling you the sandwich was decent but not great and the fries were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle there is not much more I know."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, great desserts! The staff was very friendly and seem very genuine. Not a thing I don't like about this place. I will definitely plan on coming back again to explore more of their menu items."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an inexpensive meal and love yourself some hot dogs, this is the place to be. Just don't expect some fancy restaurant. There are just a handful of boothes and they only accept cash. All the dogs come with homemade fries and they are delicious. Make sure to get the chubby dog with kraut, with chili, chicago style -- any way you want it- you will enjoy it.  Also, save room for some Italian ice afterwards. Yumm..."}
{"text":"this place is gross!!! I don't know how they stay in business. The hot dogs were nothing special, i can buy hot dogs from the grocery store and they taste better! The fries were okay, a bit greasy. They only take cash and i don't carry cash so my brother had to pay for us. Out of the 4 of us that went none of us liked the food. never going here again!!"}
{"text":"I feel like I complain a lot about the foods that I don't like... but I'm doing it again. I don't like hot dogs. My sister, though, convinced me one day to be adventurous and get a hot dog from Dazzo's. I will admit, it wasn't bad. If I had an idea of a great hotdog, that would be it, but as I said before, I'm not a hotdog fan. The fries were fantastic, but greasy, which is fine because I'm already blowing a weeks worth of calories by thinking about eating here."}
{"text":"My biggest turn-off was the CASH ONLY posted everywhere. I mean come on, everyone else started to accept debit/credit cards in the 1990's, even McDonalds joined in years ago. Get with the program. I hardly carry cash, as debit/credit cards are much easier to track my spending.

The food was OK, I had the Fire Dog with Chilli. The Fire Dog is a \"spicy\" dog, which is deep fried.  The serving of chilli was skimpy and appeared to lack meat. The sodas are fairly priced compared to other places, and the place was very clean inside."}
{"text":"This place is easily becoming one of my favorite places to eat. Fast service, good prices, pleasant employees and delicious food. I'm a chilly dogs girl but they have 9 hotdog/sausage choices. Hamburgers, chili, corn dogs and more. I recommend highly for just a regular night out."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Chicago, so I know real Chicago food. That said, I was excited to tried a bit of this and that at Dazzo's. I ate a dog, a pizza puff a tamale and a cheese burger to try to get a taste of home. Soon after sampling almost everything Dazzo's had to offer, I immediately regretted 
It. 

The tamale was microwaved and would have been better steamed. The burger tasted like $1 burger from Burger King with liquid Velveeta cheese. The \"Chicago\" dog was below average, and looked and tasted nothing like a true Chicago dog. The pizza puff was okay but a bit greasy inside. No public restroom is crazy since I drove quite a distance to find true Chicago eats!  Cash only and add $2.75 for the ATM fee Thank God Portillo's is in AZ 10x better! Maybe I should've tried the beef!"}
{"text":"Had a dog and it was LEGIT. The chili was very very good as well as the dog and bun. I didn't have the beef Sammie but I will come back for that and then I bet I will go to five stars."}
{"text":"If you have been to almost any hot dog joint in Chicago, you have been here. This is a good thing!! From the decor to the menu to the food, everything was great. 

I live in So California. I was in Peoria, AZ on business. Went two nights in a row. Hot dogs the first night. Served with fries, in a basket. The fries were not my favorite but they were OK. Also ordered a pizza puff... I love pizza puffs and this one was cooked perfectly. 

The next night I ordered a beef and sausage combo with no peppers (gasp!!) I have to say that this was some of the best Italian sausage I have ever tasted. Great flavor with some nice spice. 


If you go, take heed, cash only. They do have an ATM but I am sure the charges are high. I had read the reviews so I brought cash. 

They charge for refills on their soft drinks, odd in this say and age but it brought me back to my days as a youngin, hitting hot dog joints in Chicago."}
{"text":"Good Chicago hot dogs . I gave it only 4 stars because they only take cash, so that's an inconvenience ."}
{"text":"I have been going to Dazzo's a few times a year for the past several years now, and I have loved almost everything! My experience is limited to just a few item menus, but I have confidence that everything else is equally delicious.

- The regular hot dogs and brautwurst are sooooo good! They come with a generous helping of yum fries. My only complaint here is that the fries are really greasy and, in my opinion, should be served in a separate bag then the main food item. Oftentimes, they throw the fries in over the main item, making the whole eating experience a slightly messy affair. Better to take this food home before eating!
- My absolute favorite menu item at Dazzo's is the chocolate Italian ice. It really is an amazing treat. I tried the banana ice once but was NOT a fan. The strawberry ice is also decent, but nothing beats the chocolate. The only problem is that they run out of the chocolate ice frequently. I guess that's a testament to how often it is ordered. ;)
- The staff is very friendly! It is family owned and operated, so the atmosphere is comfortable.
- The drive-thru is awkward. Once you get your food, the drive-thru leads straight onto the street, so you'll likely be holding up the line if you need to make a left turn. Has only been a waiting issue once or twice though.

This is a great place, and I'm hoping it weathers the current economic nonsense to provide great food for years to come."}
{"text":"3-12-18 This place is seriously a gem! The beef sandwich was outstanding! The owner came to greet us and ask how the food was. It's a small family owned business who originated from Chicago, and came here in the 70's. We are from California and come to AZ once a year and this is definitely a stop every time! Thanks guys keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The search for a great chili dog in Phoenix sadly continues. I had such high hopes for Dazzo's. They have a drive thru too. 

I was advised they make a really good dog. I went yesterday thinking this would be perfect not to far from the house. Cash in hand I head out since they only take cash. I ordered a chili dog with mustard and onions $3.49 WTF? and a large fry $1.85. I thought if it's a great dog then the price is justified. 

The dog was good not great but good. It would have been better had it been hot the dog was ice cold, the bun was warmer. The Chili was tasty but luke warm. The fries were smoking hot, and tons of them. They wrapped them with the dog and put them in a bag then piled them in the bag the dog and fries were already in. I liked the fries, some should have cooked a little longer but they were good. 

Sorry forgot to take a pic of this messy goodness. The dog is all beef served in a poppy seed bun which is very soft and fresh. The chili is unlike what I am used to. Back home when it's on a dog it has no beans. I know other parts of the country use a chili sauce with beans to each his own. I prefer without beans but these tasted good. So whatever, just thought you should know what you are getting yourself into at Dazzo's. 
The fries are larger than McDonald's and they have the skin on, I quite like that. The dog was very messy had to use a knife and fork. 

All and all I gave them an A-ok, the taste was there the temperature was not. I think they have the prices wrong. 1.85 should have been the dog and 3.49 for all those fries. It evened itself out in the end. Also I think the fries would be good with vinegar.

To Megan - Clearly you have never been to the Ghetto, please remain seated in your ivory tower and enjoy the view. While Dazzo is not in the trendy area of Glendale it is not the ghetto either. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If there were more stars to give, this place would get them!! I've been going here since I was a little kid, not too long after we moved here from IL. The fries are amazing, the hot dogs are amazing, the italian beef is amazing.. Honestly I haven't had anything here  that I haven't liked. It's way better than Luke's and I even drive all the way to Dazzo's even though I live only a mile or so from Luke's."}
{"text":"Great place for a Chi-town style Italian beef! I've lived in the Valley for almost 20 years and didn't know it existed. My wife and I just made our first visit, we'll surely be back. The food was really good and the staff was friendly. Be prepared to pay cash, but they have an ATM onsite."}
{"text":"Best Chicago style hot dog and fries in the valley and super yummy Italian ices. I have loved them since I was little. Dazzo's rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here tonight for dinner with the boy. We both got the quarter pound cheeseburger with a small fry. For dessert, he had a strawberry italian ice and I had the lemon.

The fries were delicious, the burger was very tasty, and the italian ice was SO freakin' yummy. I'm glad I made the drive over and I'm sure I'll be going again.

It's really really important to note that they are a CASH ONLY joint - no credit or debit cards, people!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for hot dogs only. The dogs themselves are pretty good and I am fond of the chili chubby dog. However, everything else is sad. Disappointing. Service is rude. They always seem to  hate their job. The fries are the worst. Extremely disappointing. They are soggy every single time I have been here. Additionally, they are either overcooked or undercooked. It might be an oil temperature thing, but I think it's as a result of human laziness. The prices are good and so are the portions, but still very disappointing for the service and fries. ALSO! Their hamburgers and such are gross. I don't like them. There was just heaps of melted cheese slapped onto a soggy hamburger bun. I'll still come here for the hot dogs though."}
{"text":"This was the best little nook ever! As being a first timer, the first impression was amazing. It's not pricy. We ordered a lot of food for only nineteen dollars. To top it off, the customer service was so sweet. Dazzo's is a family owned business, so you know they care about their customers. I will definitely be back, and am bringing a crowd to share the goodness of their yummy Italian Ice!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have lived from the Northside to the Southside of Chicago and have been all over the valley they are the best! We just wish they were open on a Sundays!"}
{"text":"Some good Chicago eats on the west side of Phoenix.  Loved the pizza puff and the hot dog and Italian beef were decent. Fries were ok.  Love the logos painted outside in the parking lot-they even have the Chicago rush represented-nice!"}
{"text":"Dazzo's is & will always be my favorite place to go! I have been coming here with my family & friends since 1998! Being from Chicago myself, its always nice to eat at a place that makes you feel like you're back home! Very much kid friendly & that's awesome! I strongly recommend this  place! Their Polishes are awesome & they also have other options! Unfortunately I moved to another state however every time I come to  Phoenix, my first place is Dazzo's!"}
{"text":"Cash only really disappoints me but I figured I should try Dazzo's the one time I had cash since I live down the street. I ordered a Chicago dog. To my surprise, it came with French fries(super cheap). At first it was a pleasant surprise until I realized how greasy the fries were. I personally don't like the skin-on goopy style of fries but could've dealt with those factors if they weren't so greasy. Anyway.. the dog was OK. I don't like how the bun tasted like it just came out of a bag. The dog itself was lukewarm, more cold than hot. Nothing really knocked my socks off but I will give it to the staff. I was greeted with a smile and everyone was very friendly. I'll return to Dazzo's at some point but it's not the first place on my list."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite local treasures.
Get ready for greasy but hot and fresh fries wrapped up with your hot dog or sausage. 
I personally love the hot beer sausage with no relish. 
Trust me about this hole in the wall that accepts CASH ONLY.
You won't regret it!
The area is questionable and unfortunately I'm deducting a star for the customer service. But if u want good Chicago style dogs this is the place!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best hot dog place in the west valley!!  Fast, fresh and taqsty!1 Everything the hot dogger in you wouls love.  Hop right on over right now and try one.  It's great!!  

From the outside it looks a little run down and cheap, but on the inside all you find is friendly people and a great hot dog or sausage.  All the toppings you want are also available.    Great p[lace for a quick lunch or evening snack!!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Chicago Style Food  then you have to try Dazzo's.  They are the closest thing that I have found here in AZ that taste and looks like home besides Portillos  but that is a franchise and not close to me. The only knock is they only accept cash but I won't minus a star for that."}
{"text":"Meet Ron the owner and recommended I try their Italian beef sandwich which I got with hot and sweet peppers. This was the best Italian sandwich I've ever had it beats Portillo's. I also had fries and Italian ice which were delicious I'll be back and I also noticed you can order it by the pound. I will be back to treat my family! Thank you."}
{"text":"Some of the best dogs around.  Been eating them since 1980 when I went to Glendale High.

 Tonight I was disturbed to see on the news that a car had run through the side of the building.  Hope everyone is OK, and it doesn't hinder buisness too much because Glendale wouldn't be Glendale without Dazzo's"}
{"text":"People:

This is a hamburger, hotdog, sausage and beef sammich place.  This is not a steak house.  Please act accourdingly.   Also, they ONLY ACCEPT CASH.  Please note this so you don't kink my drive thru expereice (again)

The food here is very good, though I've only ever had the beef sammy and the sausage sammich.  Try the combo, you get beef and sausage together!  TWO DIFFERENT MEATS, ONE SAMMY. So delish. 

The owners/employees don't even ask me what I want when I go , they just have my sammy ready at the window; I pay (cash of course) , bid them a \"good day \" , drive to an undisclosed location so I can unhinge my jaw and then proceed to hoark down that wonderful mound of thinly sliced beef stuffed between two fresh slabs of  meat-juice soaked italian bread .  I think I have wood."}
{"text":"Honestly I've never had a better hot dog in my entire life. And this place is a classic old school 

destination.  Do NOT miss out on a visit here. You will surely regret it. The folks that own it are the folks making the food... for generations. Treat yourself!!"}
{"text":"We didn't go in for our food instead we went through the drive through. We ordered some hot dogs and chili fries and oh man were we stuffed. The food was great. We'll have to go again to give it another star."}
{"text":"DOGS THAT PUT THE REST TO SHAME!

I'm out in Glendale, AZ visiting fam. They took me to a dog house and said it was awesome. Being a New Yorker, I was skeptical at best. How can any dog compare to our dirty water hotdogs?

Let me say, the Chicago boys know how to make a dog. And... their fries with chili and cheese sauce was great as well. Can't go wrong with these guys! Best of luck guys and it was a pleasure meeting you! Hands down I'll give ya the dog award but we New Yorkers still own pizza!"}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here and I'll be honest, I was a bit disappointed. Here's what I ordered....

Char Broiled Double Cheese Burger: was a bit unimpressive and bland. The meat tasted like it came from Wal-Mart's frozen food section. Rated at 2/5 stars.

Hot Dog: Didn't think it was a Chicago style dog, which I've enjoyed in the past at different locations. But, this one was very sad looking. I saw the dog and was thinking of the little old lady from the Wendy's commercials \"Where's the beef\"! Rated 1/5 stars

Home Made Fries: They had this odd taste/seasoning to them and I couldn't think of what it was. They were okay at best. Rated 2/5 stars.

Onion Rings: Granted they were frozen at one point, but they tasted great. Nice and crispy. Rated 4/5 stars.

Overall, I'd still give this place another try. They did have some other items I wanted to try before recommending this place or not."}
{"text":"As close as your gonna get to home!!! Old school feel also!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a real, authentic Chicago dog. The fries are excellent too and don't forget to add cheese! No way is any of this good for you but it's soooooo awesome! Family owned business and they are all fantastic and quick with your orders. Love looking at all the Chicago memorabilia every time I go."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Went here for lunch with the fam on a friend's recommendation and did not leave disappointed!  The beef ia everything you want in a Chicago style beef!  Super fresh and moist, not dry at all! The fries were amazing as well! You can really taste the freshness of them and my 4 year old just gobbled them up! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food for low price. Try the Italian Beef sandwich and you gotta have the fries. When I first wanted to try it my boyfriend said it was going to be awful but once we went inside and tried their food he change his mind and said I am coming here more often. This place is just what Arizona needed an east coast taste. Arizona needs more of the east coast food over here."}
{"text":"I've been wanting a chili cheese dog lately and I've known this place to exist and have been told they were good.  So I went to check it out. I ended up getting a polish dog (Chicago style) I'm used to grilled onions on my polish and to satisfy my wants i got chili cheese fries. The fries were amazing.  I even ordered some to go.  Nice little Chicago style hot dog dive with decent prices."}
{"text":"This place is a Glendale legend! Whenever I am in town it is a must to swing by and get a dog with sport peppers and a lemon ice."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Burger King serves up a better hot dog than this dump. And it smells like Donald Trump's toupee sweat inside. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and a real taste of Chicago. Here you can get the real green relish and great Italian beef at realistic prices.  The place reminds me of the small hot dog shops in Chicago in the 1950's. 

The hotdogs are Vienna and the Polish Sausages are of the highest quality. Service is limited, place your order and pick it up at the counter. 

Drive thru service is very efficient and the only problem is making a left turn onto Glendale."}
{"text":"Nice little hot dog/burger place in Glendale that has been here for a while.  I got just a regular chubby dog which was good, but next time I will be more adventurous and try one with onions, peppers, etc.  Fries are tasty too.  Prices are very good, but remember it's CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"We want to thank  all of our customers for there reviews, your comments will help us here at dazzos improve to be the best. Thank you all for your support."}
{"text":"This place has really good hot dogs and Italian shaved ice. I also love their French fries. My dad drives all the way to Glendale every weekend just to have a hot dog. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place bring a piece of Chicago to Phoenix, I go here and feel at home staff is awesome food is great 100% recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent gardineir. Pretty good brat and Italian beef."}
{"text":"If you want a really good beef, or combo, this is the place to go, I grew up in Chicago and this is by far the best in the valley. They use french bread, not a crummy hogue roll, or some other substitute. I get sweet peppers on mine, and there awesome too.
There fries are fresh cut, and very tasty, not soggy and greasy.
I have also gotten a Vienna hot dog, it comes with fries, but they need to put tomatoes and pickle spear on dog,otherwise, it's yummy.....
They only take cash, no cc, so bring some cash.
They are reasonably priced, so you can get a good meal for around $10.
I have not tried anything else, I just go here for the beefs....and occasionally a hot dog."}
{"text":"Yum! Second time in! I really like this divey, cute little place. Greta service again and the food is good. When you need some comfort \"Trump\", eeuuuurummmmmmm, I mean \"junk\" food."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times over the years. It is a place I will eat at if I am in the mood for a hotdog and in the area. I would not drive across town. 
Decorated with sports memorabilia. Mostly the Bears. Maybe only the Bears. 
They serve a hot dog much like everyone else. Come on. If you use the same hotdog to start with how much different will it taste over everyone else's. Well it does. What i like best is when you bite into their hotdog there is a little snap as your teeth cut through the dog. As long as they are around I will continue to eat there when I am close. The service is always good and friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best places for Italian Beef. I love Luke's and they have always been my favorite place for Italian Beef. They have competition with Dazzo's! Awesome fries too!"}
