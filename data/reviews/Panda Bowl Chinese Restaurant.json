{"text":"Big portions low cost and very friendly mom and pop restaurant. The place is also very clean definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for the price. Their noodles are pretty good. The lady was on the phone when I walked in but she still helped me and got me in and out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Fresh, cooked to order or order from steam table either way I love their food and prices. They don't do fried chicken . Which is really better for my health.  Dine in or take out u will not b disappointed."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Los Angeles I was looking for a place that serves good Asian food so I decided to take a chance and walked in. They are great, the food is delicious and the people are so nice. This is the only place I will go for good Asian good."}
{"text":"Ok not the best. Prices are good for the amount of food you get. The teriyaki chicken is not that good. The chow mein is too thick. The beef and vegetables is good. The place is clean and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Great price. Will return. 
I was really glad they accept cards. I dont like carrying cash so they accept visa. Wished there was more space to sit and eat."}
{"text":"I was here at 10:45 a.m. and it was Yummy and Fresh.  I had the black pepper chicken and beef mixed vegetables.  The staff was friendly (I got the feeling they were husband and wife) and gave me multiple samples to try, without my even asking."}
{"text":"My favorite place for cheap Chinese take out. 
Owner is super friendly. 
The peppered chicken is a must try!"}
{"text":"This isn't the place to go if you want super authentic Chinese food, but if you're looking for some orange chicken or beef and broccoli for a quick meal, this place has got you covered. You can order take out off the menu for fresh cooked meals, or order off the buffet setup for a quick and easy bite. Prices are really reasonable and the woman who's always there when we visit has been nothing but a sweetheart to us. My boyfriend and I can get four meals worth of food for less than $20, which is less than we spend at most fast food joints (like the burger king in the same parking lot) and there's more veggies! The food isn't going to win any Michelin stars but this is American-Chinese comfort food at a hard to beat price AND the location is really convenient if you live in the area. Even if it hadn't won me over with the convenience and low-cost, the employees have been so kind and pleasant that I'd still give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese!!!!! Amazing food and great prices! Still trying to go through the whole menu now!"}
{"text":"I'd been to this place a few times and just took my family to eat and we saw a roach coming from the buffet. My feelings were so hurt because we are hungry and the food is really good! So we left and I won't be back... it's disgusting and really turned me off from eating out but we are hungry!"}
{"text":"Impressed and pleasantly surprised by the friendly service great taste and cheap prices ... Worth your money"}
{"text":"If you want quick , cheap, and good Chinese food , come here , i love there food better then panda express."}
{"text":"Finally!! Affordable, quick, tasty Chinese food by my work. I work by Cashman Field and occasionally need my fix of Chinese takeout. Their setup is basically like Panda Express. You start at one end and pick whatever dishes you want from the food trays. As far as quality I'd say on par with Panda Express or China go go. I got a 2 dish combo with half n half of fried rice and chow mein for $6.77. A similar order at PandaX would have been $8-$9. They throw in an egg roll with the combo to boot. I used to go to MB China pretty regularly until they were on Dirty Dining. For the record I think this place is better than MB. I checked Panda Bowl's rating on the health district's site and they had an A rating from Jan. so off I went. By all means this isn't fancy Chinese but for the market they're competing in I give them 5 stars. I'll definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! The Asian family who runs this restaurant are all super friendly and I feel good supporting an independently owned business. The food is fresh. I like to order steamed vegetables and jumbo shrimp. General Tso chicken and black pepper chicken rocks!!! In nearly three years of going here it never gets old and the prices are great, too!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and the young woman went above and beyond to make sure the large order was done correctly and included some extras at no charge. Much better than Panda Express but similar in style and layout. Give it a shot"}
{"text":"The food taste really good Fave black pepper chicken delicious. The noodles are thick but taste great. The lady is very nice and gives me a free soda when I buy 2 plates to go. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I found a hair in my noodles one time we told the lady and she was apologetic and gave us Free plate when we visited the next time. Fast and cheap yet delicious full of flavor food."}
{"text":"This is me and my wife first time eating here.  She wanted Asian food and this place was in walking distance. I wasn't expecting what I got. Really clean small little place. The employees were really nice and worked quickly. The food was very fulfilling and tasty. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"- Accepts Credit Cards
- Good for small couples

-- Best off the Strip Chinese Food!

Orange Chicken and Teriyaki Chicken was delicious!

Fried Rice was Bland.

CHOW MEIN WAS DELICIOUS WITH NO FILLER!!! 

Wontons were amazing!

Highly recommended! Will come again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it looked good and they are so friendly. 

I don't like Chow Mein, so I can't rate that but others did like it.  

The General Tso's chicken was better than the Orange chicken that was mostly dark meat.  

The rice was decent neither good nor bad, just rice.  That goes for both white and fried. 

The sweet n sour sauce was good, I am pretty picky about it and theirs was good! 

Eggrolls were good, but I like them mushy and not crispy so everyone's opinion may be different on those. 

Great prices, great portions, great service.  2 free can cokes with our order. 

I would not eat there again, but my hubby would eat their Chow Mein again over and over."}
{"text":"It's really good food for a great price. It's a little hidden, but it's in the shopping center where cardenas is. I got Combo A: Two Entrees, One side, and an eggroll for $6.77 (thats including tax)"}
{"text":"Very nice lady that works here. It's a ma and pa restaurant that has good food for a great price. Definitely a regular..."}
{"text":"Wanted some Chinese food so got on Yelp to locate a place walking distance. According to the reviews 5 stars. Not what I expected. Food look like it had been sitting. I just ordered the rice bowl. I do not live in the area, but when I return, I will not visit this place."}
{"text":"Usually I do not care for Chinese food, got a to go order and the food was actually really good I got the bowl which you can go with rice or noodles and one side. Great amount of food. I had the rice whick was great I had the spicy chicken which was really good as well. I got am order of the shrimp which they made fresh and it was amazing def check it out... The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. Definatly will return for another dose!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Chow mien is as thicc as my girl lol. Definitely doing here every other day because WOAH it's soo good. If you like Chinese food and if you like Mexican wannabes this is your go-to!"}
{"text":"The food was great the service was outstanding wonderful people and clean restaurant locally owned and operated and a great family place"}
{"text":"Owners r super nice gave my husband free drink...on the other hand the beef broccoli was a bit over cooked and everyone at home got a stomachache after eating from this place... flavor was ok. I personally won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have a menu?! Im trying to see what I want, and see prices... But no menu."}
{"text":"We come here often because the food is yummy.  Large portions and the lady is always a pleasure. She makes sure you are satisfied with your order. This is our weekend location when we do fast food. I rather drive a few miles more than go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Good price and great portions. 
I paid $6.25 +tax=$6.77 for fried rice, orange chicken, mushroom chicken and an egg roll. The people that work here are not stingy \"agarrados\" with the food. Everything was fresh even at 8:30 pm. I'm going to eat here from now on. Compare for yourself, I'm so in favor for this little new mom & pop business. 

Last month I went to Panda Express and paid $3-- more and got so much less food."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to Pat's Chinese Food on MLK, you might have noticed that the vast majority of customers are African-American. This demographic has encouraged Pat to modify his recipe to better accommodate his customers. That's why he specializes in chicken wings and fried chicken dishes in general. Panda Bowl Chinese Restaurant is similar in that the owner has established his restaurant in a heavily Mexican-American district, right next door to a Cardenas and a Mexican post office. This has encouraged him to modify his recipes slightly to incorporate Mexican cuisine. That's why instead of Srirachi you get Tapatio. But, besides for that the food is excellent. This place is located next to the Family Court, and Child Haven. If you are an attorney, clerk, or mental health worker in the area who wants Chinese food during your lunch break, this is the best place to go. Also, no matter how many Asian people on yelp 1-star this place, it's gonna be around for a long time since it's heavily supported by the local Mexican community, and we all know that Mexicans don't use yelp.

A short review."}
