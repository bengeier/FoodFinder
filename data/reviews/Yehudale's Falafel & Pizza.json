{"text":"This is Toronto's #1 falafel place!   Yehudale's is COR Dairy.   Israeli style fast food. If it is busy, get ready to shout your order.   Besides their famous falafel, they also make great kosher poutine (pareve gravy), huge calzones and pizzas. Another favourite of mine, veggie burger, is not on the menu, so just ask for it. They make it in a pita and top it with toppings from the falafel bar."}
{"text":"Great food, and great people. Lots of memories coming here when I was in the area as a kid!   The pizza and bourekas are amazing! I highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I'm going to let you in on a little secret....kosher food generally speaking isn't that good.  Except for amazing bagels and yes...PIZZA.  The pizza here is great. Very tasty sauce, good cheese. Dough is light and fluffy yet crispy where it should be. The combinations of toppings they have here are great as well, combinations you wont find anywhere.  The real gem you need to try are the falafel balls. Order them as a side not in a pita.  They come out super crispy, bit size and you can taste the coriander and citrus peel in them. The only place in the city I find where the falafel balls have a real refined and depth of flavor.  The service isn't the best, a bit rude, but hey its a pizza joint."}
{"text":"I used to love Yehudale's. until it changed ownership. The new employees are very young, immature and rude.  I will not go back, and it's a shame, after 20 years of being a loyal customer. I've given this store enough chances. the guy working there  and whom seems to be in charge when the new owner is not there, treated me in a rude obnoxious manner. He told me the  2 pies for $24.99 special on mon-wed was no longer in effect because it just wasn't and refused to explain,. even though it was still advertised.  then  he denied he had this conversation with me with the owner when I complained. I was offered 2 free pizzas and fries as compensation, but I never bothered to redeem it because then I'd have to deal with the rude guy again when I pick up my food. and why should I, when I go to another kosher pizza store who won't treat customers in a terrible manner.  that guy also overcharged me 3 bucks and when i questioned it yelled at me. served me fries that were heated up twice, shoe string ones, greasy and tasted like crap.  My daughter also went here and got served a burned slice because they forgot about it in the oven, and undercooked half frozen fries. i won't be back. its  a shame, 20 years a customer. I am done with yehudales."}
{"text":"Ok so you live in Thornhill and or the Area and your looking for Kosher and maybe not.  This local takeout has been serving the area for over 10 Years and I have enjoyed most of the menu several times over.  As a family business its always a pleasure walking into Yehudale's and ordering the famous Tunisian Sandwiches.  The Burkas are one of my favorite in the area.  Always a great option when I am in the area."}
{"text":"The pizza is alright here. Nothing fantastic. Nothing terrible. If you aren't kosher or don't live in the area I wouldn't say it's pizza you have to have. My wife is Jewish, and I like trying things that remind her of her childhood so that's why we opted to get some slices from here.  I'm sure the falafel here is probably better. If I was you, I'd get the falafel instead of the pizza."}
{"text":"Best Tunisian sandwich in town. Bread is crispy and the sandwich isn't easy to finish considering how generous the portions are. All the salads are fresh and made in-house. The pizza is great too. Eat it hot. Very reasonably priced for a kosher place."}
