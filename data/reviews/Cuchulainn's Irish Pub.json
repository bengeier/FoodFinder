{"text":"An Irish pub in the heart of Streetsville and finally one that carries Murphy's stout. Had the chicken fingers, which were quite nice although the fries that came with it were not that great."}
{"text":"Our servers were dilligently handling our rowdy party of 12's constant drink and food orders promptly.
Solid selection of beer on tap including one of my favourite German Weisse beers, Hacker-Pschorr (and served in the correct glass). The patio is huge and wraps around the entire pub."}
{"text":"I go here for the crisps. I love the crisps and would recommend anyone to go there for them ! As for the rest of the menu it's really hit or miss... and sometimes the quality tastes low.  I find the chicken wings look large and exciting but they are fatty and not very good... but last time I ordered the Dublin dip and it was great ! I finished with the \"sweet shoppe\" which is a deep fried Mars bar with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and crushed smarties. This is another big hit or miss... even though it's probably made the same way every time sometimes the batter has this spicy savoury taste to it.... like they are using the same batter for another item or someone messed up with seasoning that batch somehow ."}
{"text":"They have hired a angry racist black bouncer Luke who regularly threatens customers. The owner seems to power trip over this and does nothing. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Based in the village of streetsville, this Irish pub, I must say is the finest of its kind, it's excellent ambience makes you feel as if you were in Ireland itself, the staff is excellent and the service is great. This is a definite must visit establishment."}
{"text":"Great service . We had some Irish Potato chips and they where great 10/10
We also had hot wing but they where good. 5/10.
Great place to have a beer in Streetville Mississauga."}
{"text":"The aesthetic appeal of this spot from the outside is something to be envied by other bars and establishments in Streetsville. Cuchulainn's has a great out door patio, open late even on early week summer nights.

Not to be picky but the inside I found to not match the exterior. Yes it was classically pub-like but I feel a face lift is in order as this place is starting to look a tiny bit
run down - however i believe its part of the appeal, and I liked it.

With 16 beers on tap I didn't honestly come here for the design or the patio (although I will reiterate that the patio is amazingly chill) I came for the brews. After hearing our bar maids run down of their on tap selection I decided on a pint of something new - a pint of Hoptical Illusion (yes that is the beers name). And the name did not disappoint, it was truly Hoppy indeed. In fact I would go as far as to say that it was the H-optimus Prime of hopped up beers in my hopper of beers I've tried..... HOP. It was an excellent brew and I surprisingly loved the tart complex taste (reminded me of an IPA I had while in San Francisco).

I didn't partake in their menu due to the late hour, but the brew has enticed me to return for another spell here and perhaps maybe nosh on a little something nice while I work my way through their selection."}
{"text":"Was there twice over the weekend, once for just drinks on the Saturday (slammed, busy bar, which is a bit hard to get service at but hey that's that point of a Saturday night right? Plus Karoke is fun if it's good, and funnier if it's bad!

Second time and really what this is rated on was for an event on a Sunday night, excellent service (no easy feat when splitting bills among people who walk around and don't stay still!) and the food was fantastic. Obviously this was more nibbles than a meal but everything was well presented, tasty and would want more another time. Great selection of apps to be tried here for sure!
The beer selection is great, and the music is fun and I'd love to try the patio!"}
{"text":"For me, \"Streetsville's only authentic Irish pub\" turned out to be a disappointment. Their \"Burn Your Head Off\" wing suicide sauce was anything but that, and frankly, they were some of the scrawniest, dry, most overcooked wings I may have ever had.  

However, the rest of their menu looks interesting and diverse enough that I still think it's worth another look. Not too many places offer lamb burgers, pulled beef sandwiches in Guiness BBQ sauce, or Newfoundland-style \"CDG\" chips.  The decor is relaxed, the patio overlooks trendy Streetsville, and the plate service was classy. Their late afternoon \"Poverty Pints\" events offer on-tap lagers at less than four bucks, and open mic nights happen at least once a week.  Plus, thank God, it's a family-run business and not yet another franchise chain. That scores big points in my world, lad.

I just won't order their wings again.  Ever."}
{"text":"Officially my new fav Irish pub ! Wings were delicious and their beef burger is actually pretty good for a pub  burger !  Really live entertainment on the weekends really a fun place to be  Cold beer what more could u ask for!!"}
{"text":"Great little find in Streetsville.   Great atmosphere, especially during a football (soccer) game."}
{"text":"This was my old drinking hole in university. I have been going here for over 10 years and still make sure that I make a yearly stop here. The staff have always been pleasant and helpful. The drinks do change from time to time but they always have great beer available. 

I highly recommend the G Best wrap. It is the the best thing on the menu. 

If you are going to check this place out, go on a Tuesday for jam night. The local talent in Mississauga (Streetsville) is amazing and worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is a great little Irish Pub. We went in for a drink after dinner. The place was busy round 9:30 but by the time the live band came on it was jammed. The band were local boys & they were pretty good. It's a small venue & the music was loud but still good nonetheless. One thing I like to make note of...white guys can't dance!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much just what you'd want from an Irish pub. Good drink selection, with a few house cocktails, and a good mix of pub food which seems unique and homemade. I had the guiness pull (sandwich with pulled beef in Guiness BBQ sauce) which was great, not only because it was basically a sandwich on garlic bread! I also had the sweet shop for dessert which was a deep fried mars bar with ice cream. I would probably go back just for that. It was worth every calorie.
The waitress said the menu on the back of the drink menu is their seasonal menu which changes all the time, so that's pretty cool and atypical of pub food.

Note: a somewhat run-down feel, but nothing major. I've been to many a pub with a similar feel."}
{"text":"Went to try it out after recommended by a friend. Loved the chips! Soooo tasty! The service was a little off, and they don't have that many beers on tap, but I will be back for the chips!"}
{"text":"Cheers!

Cuchulainn's Irish Pub does have a great patio. A decent 16 draft selections that includes Flying Monkey's/Steam Whistle from the local brewery and a selections of Irish scotch and whiskys.

The structure though is quite historical as it was built in 1832 as a wedding present for John Burnharts daughter, each of his children received a home but this is the only one that survived. It is one of the Historical Designated building in the Village of Streetsville.

If you are in the area and feel like having a pint or 2, Cuchulainn's definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The post below by Araina N.  is not of Cuchulainn's. The pictures she posted are not from Cuchluainn's and the server she described is definitely not from Cuchulainn's. She described the pub as multi-level, it is not. It is one level with washrooms downstairs, there are no bar top tables. Cuchulainn's does not serve cheese sticks. I am not sure where she was, but it was not at Cuchulainn's.

The food and the service are always good.  I do take my family there to eat, many people do it is a very family friendly place in the afternoons and early evening. 

If you're looking for fine dining cuisine, there are other places you can go, but if you want good food in a fun relaxed atmosphere, check them out. Their hamburgers are hand made fresh, not something frozen from Costco. And they make some of the best home made soups I have ever had. I have never walked out without having had a good time, good service, and good food."}
{"text":"This place is fine, nothing really to write home about, but not bad either. The waitresses and the bartenders here are always amazing - I get the best service from them! They're super nice, quick, and witty, and it definitely makes the experience better. The food is pretty good as well, though their menu is small so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you need a bunch of options. The inside of the pub has definitely seen better times, especially in the past year or two, and I find that the bathrooms sometimes smell a little... off. It's definitely a community based bar, so you'll find a lot of locals spend their time in here, as well as the British/Irish folk. All in all, good place to get a drink and some unhealthy grub!"}
