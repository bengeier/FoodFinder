{"text":"They have an amazing selection of delicious and affordable sweets, as well as hot drinks and a menu of sandwiches. I enjoyed a molasses cookie and tea while sitting in one of their yellow rocking chairs. Cute place and I hope it does well in Middleton!"}
{"text":"Chocolate heaven! I bought so much at once that I have only been able to take a bite of each, each one was delicious. The badger bait is soooo good. The chocolate cake was delicious! The tart I haven't tried enough to form an opinion. Plus I had a bite of everything else first so the flavors started co-mingling. The brownie is okay. It was my least favorite. It'll probably be amazing when i warm it up a little though!"}
{"text":"Personally would like to see a little more breakfast fare on the early morning weekday menu. Got the ham, swiss and asparagus crepe. It was ok, nothing really significant to set it apart.   I don't usually enjoy coleslaw of any kind, but the upbeat cashier described their Asian Slaw (you get a choice of side) in such detail that I took a chance -- and it stole the show. The light addition of wasabi and sprinkle of sesame give it that extra push of flavor and texture, without the cabbage being drowned in dressing. A perfect balance."}
{"text":"Double chocolate cake w ganache was excellent, good coffee and great service. Try the ugly cookie!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with any of the desserts. Favs? Almond rocher and the famous Ugly Cookies. The meal selection is small, but always fresh and tasty. New location has a better layout for working remotely. Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"The staff is nice. Think they needed a little more help up in front. One person making coffee drinks and waiting on people who want to bring treats home is a bit crazy. Thank goodness I am a patient person and had no where important to go. The woman who waited on me was kind though and had a positive attitude"}
{"text":"A new location with some growing pains.  Stopped for lunch. They had a small lunch menu.  I had a curry chicken salad. Very good mixed greens with a tasty dressing. The curry chicken was a mild very nice curry. Instead of being mixed with the salad it was served in a separate bowl. This was a nice touch. My espresso arrived near the end of the meal. A nice strong espresso.  There is a very nice display of chocolate treats. The ones we had very very good. Not nearly as sweet as most American chocolate items. More like European chocolates.  You order at the counter and they deliver to your table.    Since they do not have decaf coffee, we probably will not return."}
{"text":"Chocolaterian Middleton...Atwood Ave's suburban sister. Way too close to my house. This is going to be trouble. Stopped by to check it out today, and was happy to see such a large savory cafe menu! Curry cauliflower cashew gallette for her, Cuban panini for him. Both served with lightly dressed greens, and both were FANTASTIC! We aren't coffee drinkers, so can't comment on that, but were very interested to see taps for cold Nitro Coffee. What? We stuck with iced tea and lemonade, but will definitely be trying the Parisian hot chocolate on our next visit. Decor is beautiful, and re-purposed old doors make up the back of the booths, which is a cool touch. Shelves of mugs and t-shirts and chocolates, which I did not have time to get a close look at as I was way too distracted by glass cases of YUM. After 10 minutes of contemplation, we finally made our decisions. The hubs got a lime square - adorable, only a dollar, super creamy and delicious. Somehow both sweet and tart. Perfect way to lighlty top off lunch. It didn't occur to me to get anything that didn't have chocolate in it, so I chose something with a trifecta. Badger Bait = brownie base, chocolate buttercream, covered in chocolate ganache. I don't know how I will ever be able to try anything else here...well, I guess I could, as long as I get one of these as well, as a side dish. Greatness. They have beer and wine too - perfect spot for a girl's night out, which I will be scheduling. STAT."}
{"text":"What a great staff.  Just threw a surprise B-Day party for my girlfriend at the new Westside Chocolaterian. Alex and Leanne really went out of there way to make all the arrangements and help me pick out a great menu. While they are best known for everything chocolate, their savory menu is not to be ignored. The quiche is phenomenal... the Cuban Panini is as good as you're going to get North of Florida.   Onto the desserts. The Chocolate Fondue is freaking fantastic.  The lime squares and lemon tart aren't to be missed. The brownies are luscious. Of course you're going to want to try the famous Ugly Cookies... but the Molasses Cookies are good too. On other visits we've indulged in the sipping chocolate. The candied orange peels pair nicely with the sipping chocolate by the way. The Badger Bait - well go try it out for yourself. I've got my eye on a few other things in the pastry case as well.   But the experience was really remarkable because the staff went out of their way to make sure it was a memorable party. I wouldn't hesitate to host another party there or use Chocolaterian for other catered events."}
{"text":"Love that's there is a location in Middleton, especially since the other one burned down. We have been here multiple times for brunch and it has quickly become our favorite place to go on the weekends. They are fast, efficient and the food is great. I love their Ham, Swiss and Asparagus crepe. Among their sweets to not miss: Kouign-amann is to die for, the Ugly cookie is a great mixture of tastes, and pistachio macaroon."}
{"text":"Excellent! We were there on St. Patrick's evening and enjoyed live music. The roasted vegetable quiche was tasty and the accompanying salad was perfect.....fresh greens, with a light vinaigrette. My mom enjoyed the pear and brie flatbread ( she enjoyed it so much that this was her second time back in a week). Although all the desserts looked great, we tried the Tiramisu which I give a thumbs up to as well! Although they appeared to be short staffed, the staff was friendly and super efficient. So happy to have a place like the Chocolaterian in Middleton.....I love to support local and have a feeling I will be back often!"}
{"text":"West side location has the bigger menu for lunches, with daily specials of a quiche, crepe and soup, along with a small menu of about ten or twelve variations and paninis. Both have large display cases of small desserts, particularly specialty chocolates, cookies, and bars.  We stopped by the week a review came out in the newspaper, and the staff were dealing admirably with the crowd, including giving everyone a free macaroon. I had the crepe with bacon, potato and cheese and it was delicious. Comes with either a side salad or kettle chips, which was appreciated, although maybe bread would have been nicer than chips.   This location has lovely windows and a wide-open feel, while Atwood feels more like a coffee shop where one lingers in nooks for a while. Neither has too much in the way of parking. I like the table with two rocking chairs! We took home a raspberry chocolate tart, which was amazing, something like a raspberry truffle with a crust. Also tried the tiramisu, which definitely had a rum kick, lighter on the ladyfinger layer, making more like a delicious mousse.  2/06/17: Back to the West side. Disappointed to have no daily crepe special, and to discover that the crepes and galettes were re-heated. The paninis were made fresh. Anyone who cooks knows there's a solid difference between fresh and reheated, particularly with foods that rely on flour shells. Took a star off for this. I'm positive they were cooking fresh during my first review (which is why they had a long wait). Still, it was four-star service and a five-star bakery case."}
{"text":"We went in with little expectations and we were blown away by the cleanliness, service and food! I love my chicken salad! Very fresh and tasty! My husband loved his truffle scramble egg with brioche bread and kids quickly inhaled Nutella crepe and a side order of pancakes! Would suggest to add more vegetarian options. Will certainly go back!"}
