{"text":"Nice coffee shop very close to campus. Their patio is open! And it's at the back of the coffee shop away from the busy regent street yay. As many earlier reviews can attest to, the atmosphere and location are great and their waffles wonderful. 

In addition to those, I especially love their drinks. I am not a big coffee/tea drinker usually, but I love their drinks because they are not overly sweet. Their mocha and vanilla iced chai are my favorite. They use ghirardelli chocolates in their mocha *yums*. The hot version comes with marshmallows, it sounds really awesome. I usually order iced drinks but if I feel like having a hot drink that will definitely be at the top of my list. 

It's a great place to chill out or to do work, enjoy or escape from the weather outside =)"}
{"text":"This place might be famous for its waffles, but it also has great coffee - in a town with its fair share of independent coffee shops, this is one of the better ones I've visited. The staff has always been warm and friendly, too. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the Regent area!"}
{"text":"I usually have meetings here with my graduate advisor.  Even though the place looks small, it actually provides a great atmosphere for conversation (not too loud, yet not too quiet).  The lattes are great, but (visually) seem really big.  

I went here recently with my husband to enjoy the waffles.  With drinks and a waffle a piece the bill came out to $26 and change.  Worth it, but you can get a much heartier meal for the same price elsewhere (like Daisy's on Atwood).  My husband had the multigrain cranberry and walnut, while I opted for the red and white.  His stayed crunchy while mine became soggy over time because of the whipped cream and strawberries.  All and all a good (and quick) Sunday brunch, but I think next time we will just split one waffle.  It's a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Mainly giving three stars because their espresso is either horribly hit-or-miss (to be generous), or almost Starbucks-caliber undrinkable. Fantastic place to study, meet a friend, and get a waffle. Totally worth checking out. Just, get a latte or any other beverage so you don't have to taste the espresso. Or try the espresso and prove me wrong, because I want to love this place."}
{"text":"Most staff are friendly or neutral, though the chubby tallish straight-haired dirty-blond waitress is rude and near psychotic in manner. Extreme hostility with no provocation can be very off-putting. Otherwise, you'll enjoy great coffee, food, and vibe! Without Her Rudeness, I'd have given five."}
{"text":"With its extremely friendly staff and great waffles, Indie Coffee is like a big warm hug, with coffee...and waffles. I just moved to Madison, and it's my new favorite place to go when I'm having a sub-par day. Get a waffle and a latte, grab a copy of the onion, and sit and ignore the rest of the world for a while. Tables seem to be sometimes wobbly and chairs aren't the most comfortable. If I lived closer I'd be there every day!"}
{"text":"They have a great breakfast menu and lunch menu that is served all day! I love the Door County Granola which consists of great big chunks of granola in creamy vanilla yogurt accompanied with Door county dried cheeries..mmm! Quietly located on Regent Street. Great atmosphere to eat, drink coffee and read the newspaper."}

{"text":"Fantastic!  The decor and layout was perfect for an nice warm espresso to start off the day in Madison.  The breakfast menu looked incredible but did not partake sadly.  The coffee was very tasty and I was intrigued by the upcoming events.  If I lived in Madison, that would be my coffee joint."}
{"text":"Indie gets and extra 1/2 star for super friendly staff at 6:30am in Dec - decent latte (with the usual addict's 4 shots) and excellent croissants. This is a simple and old-fashioned coffee bar and should be encouraged at all costs!"}
{"text":"A trendy and comfy atmosphere, free wifi, really friendly baristas, great coffee. One of my favorite places to study. I personally love their white chocolate mochas, iced tea, waffles, and regent street bagels. Tons of great stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"I love grabbing lunch here. Yummy sandwiches. Awesome chai. Reasonable price. Good vibe."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here on a regular basis for the past 3 years. The staff is always friendly and quick at making drinks & food. The oatmeal rhubarb bars are really good and they have homemade muffins baked daily. The muffin flavors change, which is nice since there's always a new one to try. I also enjoy the breakfast sandwiches. They allow you to make changes too. For example, I'll sub a bagel for a focaccia and add an egg to sandwiches that don't normally come with that. I have also called in orders in advance for when I'm running late for work and they're always ready on time. Their new power reuben, which has brussels sprouts and kale in it, is also very good.  I have yet to try the waffles since I'm usually just picking up coffee, a latte, and/or food. I'm excited to try the multigrain waffle. It's always nice when a place has whole grain options. 

Indie also has a nice atmosphere. There's a patio, a pitcher of water freely available, and they have beautiful tables and chairs. 

I highly recommend this locally owned place."}
{"text":"Love this place, location, coffee and food is superb, good customer service.Best gf bagel sandwiches. Wish they had gf biscotti though. I would say the only complaint I have is its too crowded. Very popular place. I love the coziness, but sometimes you feel suffocated. I have been a long term customer for a reason though...too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"Favorite campus coffee house. It's a warm friendly refuge on a cold day, with great tunes and good food. Indie Coffee has the best chai tea lattes in Madison, hands down."}
{"text":"Best chai I've ever had! A friend told me they make their own chai in house, and per the barista's recommendation I got the ginger chai latte (you can mix any of the flavors with the chai). I was a bit skeptical about the ginger, but...SO. GOOD. 

Friendly staff! The place is pretty small inside; if you're looking for a table on the weekend, might be tough to get one."}
{"text":"AMAZING SANDWICHES.  Yum!  Love their chicken with goat cheese on focaccia, and the turkey and spinach wrap.  The salami and red onion sandwich is intense and heavenly, too.  Great place!  Coffee's always good, too, but the sandwiches are what really draw me."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food drinks and atmosphere at  Indie coffee and the fact that  they are open early but not as busy as Panera. It's a nice quiet place to relax or get some work done, but DON'T park in the Jensen Auto lot. If you do, and find your car parked in, jyst call the police. The owner will trap you in your car and rant at you. You can park on the street out front after 8am or on a residential side street  but avoid parking in Jensen Auto even though it is not clearly forbidden."}
{"text":"Awesome waffles, definitely a Madisonian place (the sizes come in Wingra, Monona, Mendota). Coffee and atmosphere are great!

Keep your eyes open for the occasional indie shows, which feel like heaven in a cramped and cute indie space.

Oh, and there is 15min parking just a little ways away if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Fantastic and unique! The atmosphere is spot-on for relaxation and a great place to kick back by yourself or with friends. Whether you want an awesome lunch or a delicious breakfast (you cant go wrong with any of their specialty waffles or sandwiches), there's something of excellent quality that's reasonably priced for anyone who stops in. I work just down the street and stop by for waffles about three days a week so my only wish (and suggestion!) is that they had a frequent customers card! I may spend too much for my budget at Indie but the temptation is too much to ignore most days :) For killer food and great service it's worth checking out Indie Coffee."}
{"text":"Super sugary lattes but otherwise a quaint and peaceful place to study, hang out and enjoy the weather in the backyard. Its the perfect size caf√© and isn't too congested with people. The baristas were so sweet!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great drinks, and a wonderful place to hang out or study. A perfect cozy niche"}
{"text":"Indie is the best local coffee shop in the central Madison area.  I have been going there for more than 10 years, as I work close to the place.  I have tried several other coffee spots close to work, but I always go back to Indie. 
Great Coffee, but I also drink tea and a large selection of loose teas brewed in house.  I love that they do not have tea bags that you can get at a grocery store as their tea selection!  Try the Honey Licorice 1 of my favorites! 
Good food too.  The waffles are some of the best I have ever had.  For lunch try the Big Salad it is named for the Seinfeld reference. It is really yummy!
The staff and owner are wonderful, with great customer service."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times now, but I don't know why I keep going back. The coffee is fine and everything, but the interior leaves something to be desired. The tables are wobbly - I felt like my coffee was going to spill the whole time and settled on keeping my arms in my lap. I went in the winter time, and it was cold enough to be uncomfortable. I'm all for \"indie\" style local places, just not ones that skip the basics."}
{"text":"I love Indie!! Collectivo is awesome, but it's getting a little commercial. Their shaded patio in the back is a nice regent street retreat. I haven't had a lot of luck with their wifi in the past, but it's more of a book-and-chill instead of a study spot. 

The staff has always been friendly and welcoming. Today I ordered a wingra-sized (small) iced latte. It was too milky for my taste, but nonetheless refreshing. My mom is a really picky tea drinker, and this place is literally the only tea she'll drink in Madison other than Ancora. She claims that their iced black current tea is the best tea in Madison. 

Next on my list at this place are the waffles!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for breakfast and coffee in town. I had a cranberry and walnut waffle and it was quite good. It starts getting pretty busy at 8:30 and tables are somewhat difficult to come by."}
{"text":"Indie is awesome. Their iced coffee blow my mind and is really affordable, and every time I go I'm eyeing the sandwiches which look great. (Sadly, I haven't been able to try them yet.) And the back patio is a little slice of heaven!"}
{"text":"Now this is the sort of place I crave.  Perfect coffee shop atmosphere - smallish, cozy, warm lighting, not too loud but not too quiet, all in all great energy. 

While the place is small, the entry way has an alcove built around it so waves of cold air don't rush into the place every time someone comes/goes. Great touch.  This feature also creates cozy little window nooks on either side of the door which add to the charm.  Thick butcherblock tables of various sizes fill the place and tabletop lamps add to the ambiance.  

Staff was friendly, even bringing drinks out to the tables instead of yelling the orders and hoping you heard them to come fetch it.  Plenty of reasonably priced food choices were available, ranging from waffles in the $4-6 range to sandwiches and soups. Plenty of vegetarian or gluten free options too!  

In the past, we've always hit up Barrique's on Park St. but this is definitely taking over first place as my go-to neighborhood coffee shop. I like the warm, cozy atmosphere and the service also seems better here.  Plenty of parking was available on Regent St. every time I've been here.  I can't wait to check out the outdoor patio in the summer!

Note: they do seem to shorten their hours over student breaks so you may want to double-check what's listed is accurate if you're going during winter break, etc."}
{"text":"First time stopping in here - the place has a great charm to it.  Staff were friendly and the coffee was tasty.  I didn't get any this time, but they serve waffles!  Next time..."}
{"text":"A cute independent coffee place by campus. Nice, cozy, wonderful drinks and beautiful wooden tables. LOVE IT.

It's also wonderful for waffles (breakfast or afternoon snack, all day available), and lunch sandwiches like GREEN EGGS AND HAM (sounds weird but it's just pesto with eggs and ham. DELICIOUS). 

Also, drinks are AMAZINGGGGGG. Spiced Chai, hot, is my go to treat (The best in Madison since Dobra Tea sadly closed down..). Hot Cider in winter is so comforting and just right for the weather, no fake cider aftertaste, EEW. 

If you like smoothies? There's amazing variety. also, can make it boozy too. There's also beer available! And live music events (never been to one, but seems amazingggg). 

Come by for a treat during the day between classes, or come slog your way through your assignments!"}
{"text":"Perfect coffee shop.  The fact that they make sandwiches and waffles just sweetens the deal.  Do them a favor and pay with cash!

You have a mix of people sittin' on laptops and people meeting for conversation.  Everyone is just there to relax and have a good time.  They pull a mean shot."}
{"text":"What a great little find! I went here after knowing about it for a few months but never making it a point to check it out. There's very limited seating, which wasn't a problem when I went (Sunday night at about 6:30), but I could see it getting full quickly in the morning or afternoon. My waffle was delicious--fluffy on the inside and ever-so-slightly crispy on the outside--and my decaf Americano was, too. I hope to come back soon and often!"}
{"text":"Hands down the Best waffles! I've tried every waffle in the city (or so it seems) they are not all created equal, many others have been dry and crunchy or fought and flavorless... the waffles at indie are incredible. They are the right consistency of light and airy while still having a nice crisp golden outside, they are perfect t every time no matter who's working which is a feat to behold! I usually just get the buttermilk with powdered sugar and syrup but they have lots of options and even have a waffle Wednesday special, where you get a dollar off your drink when you order a waffle Also! Not sure why I haven't updated my review until now. Eat a waffle at indie you deserve it!"}
{"text":"Cute place, good coffee, wish we would have tried some of the eats because they looked and smelled awesome. Just an excuse to come back."}
{"text":"Indie is one of my favorite coffee spots in Madison. The coffee drinks are superb and all sourced well, which is important to me.
Go ahead and have anything on the menu! It's all made to order and tasty. The real treat is their waffle menu. While it's not elaborate, it's delicious! You receive e a dollar off on Waffle Wednesday when purchasing a beverage too.
The space is super tight but I don't really mind, and there is a nice, cozy back porch open when the weather is warm. The events are fun too.

My only critiques would be the salads leave a lot to be desired. They are basic and just not what I would want to pay $6+ to eat.

Pro tip: Their to-go hot beverage cups leak from the lid. This is unavoidable, so watch for spills on your hand and sleeves and grab a napkin."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places on campus. It has a great charm and great coffee. The carrot cake is something great to have and their mochas are P-R-E-T-T-Y satisfying. I love the little backyard patio for studying. It's definitely a cute little place to stop & get some work done. A final word of advice GET THE WAFFLES."}
{"text":"By far the BEST waffles I have ever tasted in my life! The staff was also great with helping us visiting from Chicago to make great drink choices! Definitely will come back and visit Indie Coffee again! This coffee shop absolutely blew me away!!! (: A real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This is a very cozy spot to enjoy a sandwich and coffee. I highly recommend the fig, honey, and goat cheese sandwich. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had!

I've heard great things about their waffles, but haven't had the pleasure yet.

The atmosphere is quintessential coffee shop. Comfy chairs and a wonderful shady spot out back. Service was excellent, the employees are very nice even when busy. 

I had the Kyoto cherry rose green tea and a mocha. Both were delicious, easily the most chocolatey mocha I've had.

Did I mention the prices and portions are great? Can't lose.

I'll be back for many more lunches!"}
{"text":"Great independent coffee shop. I've had the breakfast bagel and the waffles. The waffles are DELICIOUS!  The food is available all day. Cozy environment. I go here about once a week. I also love they finish their lattes with a nice leaf design."}
{"text":"Stopped over for breakfast with friends and found my new fav place for waffles! 

Had their cha-cha-chain with ginger and cardamom. Very nice drink after walking in the cold.  

But the best part is their waffles! I had their classic waffle. It has been years since I found a place that can cook light and \"airy\" waffles. I don't know how else to describe it. You just have to try them and you will understand what I mean. I mean, I can eat 2 or 3 at s time. 

Space is small inside so expect to make new friends so you can share a table. When the weather warms up, I heard there are outdoor seatings. 

Staff are very nice and patrons are just as nice. Definitely going to be a repeat."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Indie Coffee! I don't live in the Madison area, but visit the city regulary and Indie coffee is always a must! If anyone appreciates a good classic cup of jo, this is the place to go! 

I ordered a red and white waffle and it was  so delicious, and pretty cheap compared to other places. The dark roast house blend coffee was perfect, just how I like it with a lot of great natural flavor. The place itself is so cute, with dim lighting and warm colors- very inviting. 

The only small complaint I have is that I wish there was a little more seating, because the place is always so busy... but again I can see why, everyone must love it! I love coffee, and Indie coffee has never let me down. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've only had the beverages here, but the service has been friendly, and the drinks are excellent. I eat vegan, so a few more choices with pastries, etc. would be great - but the almond milk lattes, the cardamom chai and the \"Golden Milk\" turmeric tea I had on special were all RIGHT on time. Ambience is awesome. Will try the food some time next!"}
{"text":"One of the cutest coffee shops in Madison! It's a relativity small space that's always close to full every time I stop in. Be wary of that if you plan to cozy up with a hot beverage on a weeknight or weekend-- students tend to pack the place up. Their coffee is pretty good, but I'm sold on their chai lattes. The ginger chai latte is a cup of serendipity."}
{"text":"Visited for my first time two weeks ago. A GREAT cup of coffee. I tried their house dark roast and it was terrific! Their waffles are a must! I really enjoyed the multi-grain waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, they're big enough to share. The woman that took my order was super friendly and when she found out it was my first visit she was willing to give suggestions on what to try and loved answered my questions. They carry a rhubarb oatmeal bar that is served at the farmers market in the summer, I'm glad I found where to get them year round! I plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Indie Coffee is a Madison favorite. It's a perfectly comfy environment for a study session or a chill place to relax. Their drink specials are always changing and are so full of flavor. My favorites in the fall are the Wisconsin Hot Cider and Pumpkin Pie Latte (they always get me in the autumn mood). Their belgian waffles are a guilty pleasure I can always rely on the treat myself after finals. The staff is friendly and always good for a conversation. Not to mention the food and drink always look aesthetically pleasing &
 Instagram worthy. Always an Indie Coffee loyalist."}
{"text":"The food was good. It was a little hyped up for me so I was expecting a little bit more but nevertheless it was still satisfactory. you can get a sandwich or waffle for about $5-$8 which is very reasonable. Overall, my experience was positive, but nothing extraordinary. I would definitely suggest if you're looking for something different to try."}
{"text":"Indie Coffee is one of the best Coffee shops I've been to. The first time I went there was a live artist playing, and he was amazing making the atmosphere all that much better. The Barista was fabulous, very perky and uplifting spirit. The chai latte was simply amazing, so foamy and delicious. I've gone back several times since, and have never been let down. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and a great place to get some work done. There is outside seating, perks for summertime in Madison. Adequate seating is inside. Indie is a great place to be."}
{"text":"I was shocked to find that I had not yet reviewed Indie Coffee on Yelp. How did that happen? How have I stopped here so many times for snacks and drinks on lazy mornings and never sung it's praises? 

Here goes: 
*Indie Coffee is wonderful! The staff are always friendly and the energy in this small cafe is always delightfully humming. 
*The food is delicious and filling. I've never had something I didn't like from the menu.
*The lattes are beautiful, and tasty."}
{"text":"As a work-from-home type, I spend a lot of time in coffee houses getting out of my house. Indie is my absolutely favorite. Their coffee is great, they have some tasty drink specials (the salted carmael latte is very tasty!), and waffles. Oh, the waffles.
 
Indie is small and not a great place to bring kids (sadly) unless they're of the older variety--there are some games but not a whole lot of space, and there's a lot of folks getting work done. Really, that's the only drawback--and for people who don't want to be around kids, well, that's not a drawback at all..."}
{"text":"Nice cute coffee shop!

I enjoyed the cranberry walnut waffle as well as a well made cup of hot chocolate. I went probably about nine on a Monday morning and was surprised at how busy it was. The tables were all pretty much occupied with individuals studying, eating or chatting. Granted it was a small space but it seemed to be very popular that morning. Service was efficient and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Friendly and inviting service and makes an amazing latte. Prices say come back often and plenty of fresh baked goodies"}
{"text":"Indie has a great, funky atmosphere, with a nice little patio out back in the shade of a big tree.  The coffee is very good (in my opinion, it's the only place off the Square that really has good espresso).  Their granitas are very refreshing in summer, and the grilled sandwiches and waffles are tasty.  Their pastries and desserts aren't as exciting, but that's OK.  I don't get there as much as I used to when I both lived and worked in the area, but it's still the only place with good espresso that is open evenings and Sundays, so I still make the trip sometimes."}
{"text":"Love love love Indie Coffee! It's not near where I live and that makes me soooooo sad. My first visit was last Saturday-my bf was running CrazyLegs and we figured this would be a good place to meet up afterwards so he wouldn't have to walk home. I'm so happy this little place popped up on my search for coffee near Camp Randall! The space is small but accommodating with plenty of seating (and a patio out back for when it gets nicer!). The staff was super friendly and I agree with other reviewers-I just love the fact they will bring your coffee out to you-no standing around waiting for them to call our your name. In fact, they didn't even ask my name or give a table number-just made my drink and found me at my table. Love it!

On to the drinks...I ordered a red-eye chai (fun fact-they call it a red-eye instead of a dirty chai-adding a shot of espresso). Now I'm not a huge chai fan but felt like trying something different. And my sis was with me and she loves all things chai so it was probably her inspiration :) They have about six or seven different chai flavors to choose from which I've never seen before. I went with the chocolate chai and it about knocked my socks off. My sis had the vanilla chai and was just as impressed, stating it was one of the best chai's she's ever had. I was sad I ordered the small. And I've been dreaming of that drink daily since having it. My work occasionally brings me near Camp Randall and you can bet I will be stopping by Indie for my morning cuppa."}
{"text":"Had a latte, and a almond croissant there - staff was very friendly. Very cute little coffee shop, nice environment no matter for sitting to enjoy a breakfast like myself, or working on a laptop or chat with friends. It's a little gem around this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Solid Madison coffee shop. Great sitting area in the back with plenty of trees, A++ coffee, good service and decor. Very conveniently located. Overpriced food options, limited number of seats."}
{"text":"I do my best not to just hand out 5 star reviews, but Indie Coffee is earning it with every visit I make. I used to sling coffee at Marigold Kitchen, and I've been to most of the cafes/coffeeshops around Madison - Victor Allen's, Steep & Brew, Etes-Vous Prets, Mother Fools, Ground Zero Coffee, Fair Trade, Michaelangelo's, Sunroom Cafe, and the Washington Hotel Coffee Room, to name a few  - and an extraordinary few even come close to the quality and prices of Indie, especially when it comes to food and service.

I'm a fan of the teas there, especially the clementine clove and the pomegranate rosehip, and my boyfriend is a devotee of both their hot and iced mochas, as well as the creamy, flavor-packed chai. While I normally roll my eyes at those who deviate from the small/medium/large size names (Starbucks, I'm looking at you), the Wingra/Monona/Mendota names are sweetly local enough that I find it endearing. I also appreciate that they let you buy entire pots of tea, which can be meted out at a leisurely pace without losing their heat.

The sandwiches and soups are something to behold. The Regent bagel sandwich is elevated by a flavorful zing of goat cheese, the Greenbush bagel sandwich is hearty and rich, and the chicken focaccia is an excellent combination of textures and flavors on mouth-wateringly fresh bread. I'm not that much of a vegetarian, but those who are have an extensive list of options. The soup of the day rotates, but I've had the pleasure of trying the chicken & sausage gumbo, which felt like a reawakening on a frigid day. The cup and bowl sizes are smaller than your average Wisconsin cup and bowl sizes, though, so you may want a little something extra if you're looking for an entire meal. The bread that accompanies the soup is warm, crispy with a chewy center, and delicious on its own or dunked in the soup.

The walls are painted warm colors, which are very comforting during cold winter months, and in the summer, there's a lovely back patio on which you can sit - secluded from the hustle and noise of Regent Street, but open enough for fresh air with plenty of shade on hotter days. The wireless is reliable, although loading videos can take quite a while. The only thing I'm not wildly enthusiastic about is the seating - the chairs aren't the most comfortable thing, though I do like the benches along some walls and the easy chairs toward the front are great for curling up on with one of the available newspapers. It can get crowded in the late afternoon, but fellow patrons are Midwestern-level nice, and often will shift and share tables with strangers in order to make sure you have a place to sit.

And I have to single out Indie for some of the best service I've had in Madison. Every single time I've been in, the person at the counter seems genuinely happy to be there, which is a rare find in this town. Hair is well-secured by baseball caps and ponytail holders. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu, and they're practically never out of anything. Every time I've asked for a recommendation or help with choosing between multiple options, the barista has provided excellent advice, with reasons why they prefer something. And the night that Snowpocalypse 2011 began, after I'd left Indie, the barista (a slight guy with glasses in his twenties - Indie owner(s), if you are reading this, give the man a raise!) noticed I'd accidentally left my laptop charger there, and hauled ass outside into the freezing, snowy cold, to make sure I got my charger back before the city shut down. Incidentally, Indie Coffee was open the next day, even when the University itself had shut down."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, ham and havarti on pumpernickel bread, pumpkin spice latte, and a corner seat facing the front of the cafe. I've heard so much about the waffles here, I'm already plotting my return. Atmosphere is eclectic, intellectually charged, and comfortable. This place is small, every seat was full when I was there and I just happened to luck out and catch a spot right when I got there. By the time my food was served there were people standing with their coffees and talking, completely uninterrupted by the lack of seats. 

Indie serves excellent coffee. I'll be certain to add them to my playlist."}
{"text":"Was in a bit of a hurry and they took longer than expected. The food was fresh and tasted great, though."}
{"text":"Good smoothies, nice staff, a decent atmosphere, and decent food make Indie Coffee a good destination in the Regent area.

In terms of smoothies, they're good because they're actually smooth and all have a good bit of tang to them that I enjoy. In terms of atmosphere, it's pretty mellow, but has some hints of a music theme going. When you enter, you see some covers to popular albums, although those cuts don't at all say \"INDIE\" to you. One fun thing I liked is that their drink sizes are in 3 sizes: Wingra, Monona, and Mendota. It's little things like that that give it a good local zest. In terms of food, I can't say anything about their waffles, but that's just because i'm not a waffle guy and haven't had them. But i've had several of their sandwiches. The honey/fig/goat cheese is good if you have a bit of a sweet tooth. The pesto egg focaccia, grilled cheese bagel, and veggie cheese focaccia are all also good choices. They're all pretty reasonably priced too, at just $5-7. I would recommend against the mediterranean wrap however. That one is just incredibly soggy and messy, and the hummus they use in it is a bit disappointing.

And one final note: They have an outdoor area in the back when weather permits, and it's usually nice. However, the last time I ate outside there, there were bees hanging about, and they were REALLY attracted to the honey/fig/goat cheese sandwich I ordered. Pretty unpleasant, but i'm sure this isn't a frequent occurrence there."}
{"text":"I tried Indie Coffee for the first time today. I ordered their Ghirardelli Mocha and their Red and White Waffle. The mocha is the best mocha I've ever had and the homemade whipped cream on top is perfectly light and fluffy. The Red and White Waffle has strawberries with their house-made whipped cream! I got a side of their Ghirardelli Chocolate Sauce to pour over my waffle and it was great. The balance of the soft buttermilk waffle with the tart strawberries and the rich chocolate was an awesome decision. I will most definitely come back here again to try other items on the menu. I would highly recommend Indie Coffee for locals who have not been here and for new people in town. It's a great place to have in Madison. There is WiFi too if you're looking for a place to do work on a laptop. The downside to this place is that it seems packed all the time but you can always ask to share a seat with a stranger."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good service. We went on Saturday morning around 9 and it was not very busy. Decent coffee, but I ordered a chai latte and for something akin to cappuccino."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, nice staff. Usually too crowded for me. I have never had the food as a result. I like a comfortable place to sit down and not feel rushed. If you like crowded places, check it out."}
{"text":"Dropped in here to study for a couple hours. Good internet. Bike posts out front. Didn't try any food (waffles) but the strawberry ones looked delicious, at least. I would definitely come back to this place to try the waffles. I got a small iced latte which was pretty standard. Soy and almond milk available for those looking for alternatives. Note that there isn't too much seating, and this place gets fairly full during the day. The two seater tables are better for a quick bite and less for studying (a bit small esp for more than one person). Cute place, good for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Spending an afternoon in Madison with my mom, I wanted to find a perfect cafe that was off the beaten path and that served hella good espresso. 

My mom loved her latte but my cappuccino fell a little short; the steamed milk consistency and ratio was off which resulted in a 6 oz latte pretending to be a cappuccino. It drives me a little nutty when I go to a cafe expecting top-notch baristas and I get someone who hasn't mastered a traditional cappuccino.  

But, everything else about this little shop was fantastic -¬†the atmosphere, cozy window seats, and nice selection of baked goods and fresh lunch items. I'll definitely go back though and hopefully I'll get a better barista next time."}
{"text":"-Great coffee
-Great creative lattes (they always have fun seasonal ones)
-Waffles are obviously amazing
-Other food is very good too (love the fig goat cheese sandwhich)
-love the ambiance
-staff is friendly
-in the warmer months they have a very nice outdoor seating area out back that is like a little secret garden"}
{"text":"Yay Indie! I love the cute tables by the window. Indie is great both in the summer and winter. In the winter, you can go and hunker down with your latte. In the summer, you can sit on their back patio (so cute) and sip an iced chi. They also have live bands on some nights.

The baristas are nice and down to earth. They also work really hard because it's usually one person during the afternoons and evenings who has to serve both coffee and food. The food is not cheap. I've bought a few small bakery items made locally, but not much else.

A major downside is that the hours aren't great for students who need to study late. I lived near the coffee shop for two years and my roommate and I would say \"let's go study at Indie,\" and then would realize it would close soon after we got there."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, Indie is the best place to get coffee in Madison. It has great ambience, fantastic coffee, a varied and delicious menu (including, my favorite, waffles all day), and friendly staff. Their wifi is fast and free, and there's a fun patio out back to enjoy the warmer days. On the shelves, you can grab a board game like Scrabble or Mastermind. Every once in awhile, they even have live music typically of the (obviously enough) coffeehouse genre. Jason Mraz even played a show at Indie when he was in town for a slightly larger show at the Kohl Center!"}
{"text":"This place is seeeewww cute! I love the decor inside. They have quite a few food options for breakfast and lunch with a wide variety of ingredients. The drinks are well thought-out and super refreshing! My iced caramel chai latte had delightful caramel whipped foam on the top. My friend liked her iced salted caramel latte but said it wasn't cold enough at first. The service was kinda slow but they only had 2 baristas. We sat outside on a perfect day and it was v relaxing! Will be back to read/study this semester."}
{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy. After a week of cheap, bitter coffee in the communal lounge, this place is a sanctuary. The last few times I've been here I've gotten the caramel mocha, peppermint latte, and the cardamom latte. All were quite tasty and had a good amount of the special ingredient's flavor. 

I've had the waffles here, too, and they are pretty good, considering that it's a coffee shop. Nice and fluffy and sweet.

A random thing I really like about this place, though, is that they serve your drinks in real mugs if don't order to go. Something about drinking from a non-disposable cup just makes the drink that much more satisfying. Also the time I got the caramel mocha I got this cool leaf shape in my foam. Sweet!

Great drinks, tasty waffles, friendly staff, and relaxing atmosphere. What else could you ask for in a coffee shop?"}
{"text":"I had the iced green tea and the fig and goat cheese sandwich. Everything tasted amazing... The sandwich would have been life-altering if it wasn't the size of a postage stamp."}
{"text":"They do their espresso right (or close to it!).  The best in Madison that I'm aware of..."}
{"text":"I often pass by Indie on my way to my favorite coffee shop on the Square and after my last visit, I need to stop in more often.  Yes, parking can be a hassle to find (street parking only) but the vibe is strong and they make excellent drinks.  Seating can be tough during the busy times but in warmer weather, the back patio serves as a nice respite."}
{"text":"Love this place! I live fairly close and just started coming here. So far I've tried the salami focaccia, chicken focaccia, and pesto omelette focaccia. Salami focaccia so far is the best! Also had an iced white mocha which was alright. Prices are similar to Starbucks. Not a ton of seating, and not a lot of outlets but a really nice pretty quiet space to study if on the go. Staff is always super nice!"}
{"text":"small homey coffee shop.  the coffee is delicious, also the waffles are solid too.  i like this place."}
{"text":"I first ended up in Indie Coffee years ago while killing time before a show at The Annex - I don't remember much about my visit except that it was warm and cozy and great alternative to waiting in line in the cold. Fast forward to the other day when I made my return for a quick business meeting. 

The cafe is still cozy and inviting, maybe even more so when natural light is pouring in the windows. The baristas were kind and helpful, with quick service and bringing my drink to the table I was sitting at even though I had ordered it to go (I can be a slow sipper and figured I would need a to-go cup eventually). 

I ordered a hot chocolate and it was more milky than chocolaty, and not at all unpleasantly so. I was surprised to find myself enjoying it, as milk in and of itself tends to gross me out - I stopped drinking it in second or third grade, save the occasional glass of chocolate milk, and have moved toward non-dairy milks as an adult. Chocolate plays second fiddle, but makes for a nice, less sugar-bombed way to start your morning."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about and reading about the waffles at Indie... They are tasty. As was the Egg and Cheese Bagel Sandwich. I had mine on an everything bagel. Hard to screw up this sort of combination. The bagel  sandwich was run through the panini press - interesting. 

My try everything breakfast... waffle, bagel sandwich and a medium iced coffee was just over $12. A good quality value. So don't think of Indie for just coffee, they have solid food service as well."}
{"text":"Best Iced Coffee in Madison.  What else do you need to know during Summer?"}
{"text":"WAFFLES WAFFLES. I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF THE WAFFLES. Cranberry walnut multigrain = a choice you will never regret. Awesome atmosphere to hang and sip a pumpkin chai (sugar and spice and all things nice), do work, think about how Regent needs more top notch stomping grounds like this."}
{"text":"I love how cozy this place is. Great place to grab a quick coffee, but also a great place to do work in, meet up with a friend. The backyard patio is enjoyable in the warmer weather, and the waffles are great! Sandwiches are yummy and their chais are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I was only in Madison for a few hours before returning home and wanted to check out a local coffee house. I choose Indie because of the consistently good reviews and my experience surely lived up to those reviews! Very cute place, immediately greeted and helped as I walked in the door. Baristas were very friendly and I found a nice, small table to sit at. The decor is a perfect mix of old and new, combining historic and modern touches. I ordered a latte and the pesto omelet focaccia and both were absolutely delicious! I am usually a slow eater but couldn't help scarfing down my meal! Overall fantastic experience, I wish I lived closer so I could visit Indie Coffee more."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious coffee, and made swiftly. Their specialty recipes deliver as desired; the Mayan Spiced Mocha burns just nicely at the back of the throat, the Nutty Professor has a hazelnut warmth, the cardamom and Marzipan are delightful. Don't miss the waffles, either. They don't slouch, and Waffle Wednesday leads to friendly pricing.

The staff are also kind. They ensure organization, socialize with interest and respect, and work honestly.

As State Street loses its charm to corporations, Indie Coffee remains a delightful alternative just off campus."}
{"text":"Totally love this place. I feel very welcomed here and the people are sweet. I treat myself a coconut cream pie coffee which turns out to be so amazing! cauz usually i do not like very sweetie coffee like mocha, this one is just right for me in such a sunny day!"}
{"text":"I discovered their light, crispy multi-grain waffle.
I've been waffle hunting in Madison, and for me, the Indie's is the best one. It's not the over loaded with whip cream and syrup kind - it's definitely a lot more lighter (and maybe healthier?) but works damn well for my taste.

The only down side is their coffee, which is kinda sub-par. 
So remember, waffle and tea. With those, you'll be happy at this place."}
{"text":"I took some time to actually glance around the place today when I stopped in with my son for a quick cup of coffee to go before digging into the drudgery of preparing for a move.

Now I realize that 'Indie' Coffee refers to independent film, as there are film reels and cameras on the walls and counters. So yeah, neither here nor there but...anyway.

The sizes for their brewed coffee are named after the local Madison lakes, and I got the largest size, which I believe was the Monona. I thought it was very reasonable at $2.25. There was a house brew, an Ethiopian brew and a decaf ready to go, I chose the Ethiopian. It was their lightest roast and it was delicious, if a little less strongly brewed than I would prefer it. The temperature was pretty hot but not unreasonably so, and it tasted very freshly made.

My son had a large iced caramel latte and he didn't remark about it one way or the other, but had it gone in a flash. 

We've gone there before to work on our laptops and have discussions, and it's quiet and intimate enough for both. I kind of like their thick, butcher-block style tables and the little lamps on them, which makes it feel cozy and homey.

Last time we had food too, bagel sandwiches, and they were great. Mine had spinach and roasted red peppers, always a great combo.

The service is understated in style, but pleasant, timely and accurate. Parking is an issue, as for any Regent Street business. Nice vibe, and altogether cool place."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The vibes are great, and the waffles are actually fantastic."}
{"text":"Waffles! Do I need say more for a Saturday or Sunday morning?? Oh yeah, coffee! You NEED to pair a waffle and some coffee at Indie. This is a must in Madison. Bike on over and nosh on some deliciousness right now."}
{"text":"I do love this place! Delicious coffee and food and a nice ambiance! The AC is also nice on a hot summer day! My only complaint is that I found a dark hair inside my bagel stuck to the cream cheese when I opened up the bagel. Maybe the people making the food should wear hats? Otherwise I love the bagels!"}
{"text":"Cool little place. Bacon, egg, and cheese bagel toasted on a panini press was unreal. Cold brew is the best in town. If you are an iced coffee lover and looking for something new to try, try the iced caramel Milano!"}
{"text":"Good indie...d.

I've casually perused their waffle menu before and this time decided to take the plunge. Yum. That's pretty much all you need to know. Well, that and the fact that they'll bring together any ingredients they currently have on the menu to make something marvy for you. Different batters, different add-ins and different nuts sort of make the possibilities endless. But maybe don't mention that I told you this. ;)

I haven't found a great place to park, but a short trip down one of the residentials is worth the walk to waffle happiness. Oh and their iced coffee ain't so bad either!"}
{"text":"Stellar spot - worth the hype! The latte was on point, balanced, foamed well, good pour. The golden milk latte was perfect and the fig spread sandwich was stunning. Would return here any day. Also the place itself is quite charming for a college coffee shop."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee places in town, especially for the delectable iced coffee and good service. The ambiance is great, with good music, too. There's a back patio that's intimate, quiet, and comfortable. The salads are honestly the best kept secret in town; those things are fantastic, even better than those bizarre specialty salad places on State St."}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee shop located on regent street! 

Perks: 
- great coffee
- amazing customer service
- good prices 
- great selection of food and pastries 

Drawbacks:
-Lack of parking spots
- not a lot of tables
- it can be kind of loud at times"}
{"text":"I've now gotten waffles AND bagels AND different drinks. I love them all. There's always lots of flavor packed in, and you get a good amount of food too! Reasonable prices and super friendly staff make this place an A+ in my book."}
{"text":"Cute little campus coffee shop that is known for their waffles. I got the pumpkin pie latte. It was average. The workers their are nice and eclectic."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Cute place. They were pretty busy, but the service was great! The guy taking our order pointed out when someone left so we could grab the table. I had the honey, fig and goat cheese sandwich and it was fabulous. My sister-in-law had ham and cheese on gluten-free bread. They have a good selection of vegetarian options, so I'm excited to head back to try something new. Biggest downside was the plating and presentation. Big plate for only a sandwich, but it was a delicious sandwich, so I can overlook that."}
{"text":"Sometimes this stretch of Regent street can feel pretty depressing....but there is light in the darkness!  Indie Coffee!  The baristas are friendly and you can feel comfortable either studying or hanging out.  The waffles are very reasonably priced, and made fresh to order.  The red and white waffle features a house made  You can also put an extra spring in your step by adding an alcoholic beverage to your order.

Look for the Little Library outside the door and pop in!"}
{"text":"Walk through the door and see a Yo La Tengo poster on the wall and hear SPOON blaring over the loud speakers... YEP you guessed it... I'm in love!  
Super happy I got the chance to play a show at Indie Coffee, but not only did I play I hung out there working all day to great music, great coffee, and had a Vegan Wrap that was delightful and large and in charge! 

The staff were all super sweet, and I got to meet the couple that owns the place.. J.J. and Merritt.  They were both super supportive and awesome!  

If you are going to be in Madison and need a place to work or just need a coffee head here, the food, the brews, and the people rule!  And the music over the speakers will keeping you rolling!"}
{"text":"It's conveniently located and the ambiance is kind of nice with their new remodel, but I would absolutely not return.

Pros:
free wifi
sturdy, nice, new tables
live music (quiet enough to think) if that's your thing

Cons:
Exorbitant prices (a soy chai latte that was mostly foam for over $5 and a tasteless, microwaved omelet for $7.5)
Rude staff - they told me rudely \"no carry-ins allowed\", so I was forced to pay crazy disgusting prices for their food since I was hungry and needed wifi
Loud kitchen - they're really loud in cooking and in making the coffee, so it was hard to get my school work done.

Go there at your own risk."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great relaxing place amidst the industry and speed of regent street. Minus one star for only having like three parking spots out front so not super accessible for non students but the majority of customers are Badger kids so it makes sense. I was particularly impressed that they have many types of milk including soy and almond."}
{"text":"The name says it all...

The rise and fall of the independent coffee shop is directly correlated with the rise of Starbucks, Caribou, Peets, et al.  But a few resourceful dreamers keep the independent coffee shop alive and Indie Coffee nails it.

They are housed in a great building that screams authenticity.  As you walk in, you see the concert posters of some great bands (I should have taken pics, I recall Yo La Tengo being one of them).  

The coffee is excellent.  Not sure if I would call them a \"third wave\" coffee shop but close.  Great breakfast options that go beyond a muffin or bagel.

Switch some of your Starbucks budget to the independents...you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop. I highly recommend having the fig, honey, and goat cheese sandwich if you're looking for delicious and healthy lunch. It makes a great study spot, too."}
{"text":"Wrong order! I ordered to go so got to see only after I went away. 
It just left me with a bad taste and don't feel like going again. Won't return."}
{"text":"I lived just a few blocks from Indie over the summer and it was my favorite spot to take care of my morning emails and read through the news. A great spot to warm up before your day or meet for delicious waffles with a friend! The staff is super friendly and have great suggestions for drinks."}
{"text":"Service here is always prompt and the workers are friendly.

the BEST chai latte and any coffee latte in madison!! They have alot of flavors for syrup, even unique ones like creme brulee.

its also a nice place to study usually quiet or even take a friend to catch up."}
