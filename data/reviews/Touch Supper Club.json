{"text":"I've only ever been to Touch for drinks, but decided to meet a couple of friends for dinner. From the moment we arrived, the experience and service were poor. Nobody greeted us when we walked to the host stand, but several employees glanced and kept about their business. After about 5 minutes of this, we just sat at the bar and hoped for the best. The bartender was so condescending and didn't seem to know where anything we asked for was. Three of the drink selections we made throughout the evening were unable to be found. The employees were often swearing and watching things on their phones behind the bar instead of tending to their patrons. The food was mediocre at best and two of the items we ordered food-wise were not ready to be made, therefore our ticket times were very long. Our bartender would walk past empty drinks several times and not bother to ask if we'd like a refill. And, last but not least, when we had finished our food and drinks we actually had to put our credit cards on the bar to signal wanting a check because of course the bartender just kept walking by. She actually tended to three new customers and cashed them out before even getting our checks from the time our entire meal was done. The only positive I can mention is the mashed potatoes were good. And, in theory, their drink selection is lengthy, but most of what we ordered wasn't in stock. I will not be returning to Touch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Touch, for brunch, at least once a month.  Needless to say, we love it!  The Bloody Mary Bar is loaded with awesome garnishes, mixers and an impressive amount of hot sauces.  The menu is filled with great options; among our favorites: Fruity Pebble pancakes, Chicken and Waffles, the Touch Bowl, and the Eggs Benedict.  The staff is also great; Kevin, the bartender, makes awesome drinks and delicious mimosas, and Jen always makes us feel so welcomed!  These things make Touch a great place to visit!"}
{"text":"I went here with a rather large group for a birthday party. We had the private back room wich was rather comfortable. It kinda reminded me of a dormitory from harry potter. Large wooden book shelves, and oversized curtains, and plush pillows. My dirty martini was well prepared. A good sign. The rest of the group chose from a large variety of craft beers, and wines. The menu was a good size with a variety of trendy choices. I got the signature Touch Pizza Coppa, tomatoe, mozzarella, basil. I added mushrooms as well. Although the quality of the ingredients were top of the line, the pizza was MUCH too salty. Aside from that common complaint among our party, great place, will be back again."}
{"text":"Ummmm. Came here on Saturday of Valentine's weekend.  I was with a group of friends and we wanted to order off the regular menu, which was offered in addition to the Valentine's menu.  Ended up that we had to change our order THREE times because they were OUT of everything.....at 8pm.  Very disappointing ---no idea how that happens.  Very bad planning, sub par food, all around frustrating experience."}
{"text":"I remember Touch when they first opened. It was always tons of fun. Food with chic bar-lounge upstairs, while the backroom had a couple of pool tables and felt totally casual. Downstairs was a dance floor and additional bar with DJ set up. I spent many a fun night at Touch.   I can't say what it's like these days. Ownership changed hands a couple years back, and now I live in San Diego. But I do remember the heydays with Mazi spinning downstairs. Good times!"}
{"text":"This bar prides itself on being the Dive Bar of Ohio City. Since when is that a good thing? The employees have no respect for their customers and only have an agenda for themselves. I am confused how they generate revenue because they seem to be only interested in entertaining other Touch employees. At the end of the night our uber did not even know where to pick us up because he was unfamiliar with the area. I expressed my concerns to a number of employees without them giving a shit. I would never go back and this is an abolishment to the well-established area"}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland for the OSU v. That State Up North - Frozen Diamond Faceoff hockey match. Since it was a Sunday, eating options were slightly limited in the area if you were trying to avoid chains. As I was being shown around parts of the city, we stumbled upon Touch. The people I was with gave rave reviews, so of course I had to try it.  It was their Sunday Brunch - and the place had a really cool vibe. Full bar, high tables, great decor. First off, I ordered the Bloody Mary Bar, which had all the essentials and quite a few additions. I was thoroughly impressed. And the price was just right.  For food, I had the Veggie Omelet which was chalked full of spinach, tomatoes, onions, peppers, cheese.....YUM! It was a hefty size too, as I couldn't finish it. And the 'tots that came with it were the perfect crunch and seasoning. The other folks had the french toast (which was wolfed down) and I'm told was AMAZING with the cream cheese. And the other had some blueberry pancakes, I believe.... which he really enjoyed, as well.  What was also really nice, was that we got fruit bowls for appetizers w/ the brunch. A nice touch!  The bathrooms were very neat. There are two, single bathrooms that have nifty \"Vacant\" style locks on the outside. Sticking true to the decor.  These type of places I find comfort in, and I can't wait to come back to try more of their selections!"}
{"text":"I've had consistently mixed experiences at Touch. Sometimes it's a solid Four Stars. Others, I walk away frustrated. Sometimes there is actually free sushi for happy hour. Other times, it's gone so fast you may get two pieces after waiting a while.   This last trip really bugged me. We did come in with a large group and no reservation. I will give them that. But if they didn't have the staff, the shouldn't have sat us. Our waiter was very nice, but largely absent. We waited for a long time just to get waters, then a long time to get drinks, then a very long time to even get to order food. Then my dish was the last to come out, Chicken and Waffles. It was completely raw in the middle. I returned it and then waited another half hour to get a new one. Of course, this one was well over cooked, just to make sure.   To their credit, they did apologize, and gave me a free beer. But  when we left, I realized that brunch had taken two and a half hours. Yikes!   It'll be a long while before I go back again."}
{"text":"Went there for Thursday taco night (we didn't know about the deals). My husband and I had four great tacos (very generous fillings) and each of us had one of our favorite Christmas beers. Server did a good job with recommending how many tacos to order and we had a really nice dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we keep going back to Touch when I keep giving it three stars. I think it's the inconsistency that holds them back from the exalted four star range. It was the two of us again for brunch. Baloney sandwich for the old ball and chain and hash with poached egg for me. This time we asked for the sandwich to be grilled and it was. Very good. Lots of caramelized onions. Tots were fresh, and the oil tasted better. Hash was pan fried this time and VERY crisp. Clearly a different person was cooking. Good music again, friendly bartender."}
{"text":"I'm just going to come out and say it - I don't think I'll be eating here again anytime soon.  On a whim of a date night with the bf a while back, we decided to check out Touch for some grub and drinks and the experience was less than stellar.  Upon arrival, we were greeted and then left to stand around and wait for quite some time, only to then be told that there would be about a 15 minute wait for a table, but mind you the place was MAYBE half full.  So we took this opportunity to order drinks at the bar, which was about the only good service we experienced all night.  Once we were seated about 15-20 minutes after arrival, we plopped down at our cozy table in the back (I will say the decor was pretty great - very warm and comfy), only to wait some more.  When our server approached our table he was incredibly short with us and I think turned into an exchange of 5 words to us all night.  However, we were able to order pretty quickly, which then segued us into, yep - you guessed it, more waiting.  Our food took quite awhile to come out - I ordered a warm salad and their tomato basil bisque and the bf some steak, and to say the least we were not impressed.  Too much salt, his food luke warm - just not what I was expecting from Touch.  I'm willing to give it another go - maybe they were having an off night.  Or maybe I need to check out their bar/music scene instead (which I've heard some good things about).  I'm not totally ready to just write this place off and hoping that your experience trumps mine."}
{"text":"This is a review of their brunch. I have yet to eat here for dinner.   I've eaten at Touch twice for brunch. It's one of the top brunch restaurants in the city, and I've been to many. The first time I ordered Eggs Wellington (like Benedict, except with steak) and sampled the breakfast burrito. Both were delicious. The hollandaise was terrific, and everything was prepared just right. The burrito was both yummy and upscale. The second time I ordered chicken and waffles. The portion was very large. The waffle was as good as they come, and the tempura style chicken breast was juicy and crisp at the same time.  Service was fast and friendly. I had the same waitress both times, and she was great."}
{"text":"Sometimes you find people just totally mismatched for their jobs. The entire staff at Touch fits that description. Really really terrible experience. The night manager is the worst offender. Dude sits around watching the staff struggle as he sits on his phone. This place stinks. Food was ok, not over priced but generally very mediocre."}
{"text":"Stopped in for our second time for brunch.  Everyone really enjoyed their meals.  I had the Mexican Omelet and Bloody Mary Bar.  Other meals included pot roast hash and the chicken and waffle.  Everybody was sharing bites of their dishes, mainly so they could taste the other dishes.  The service was superior and friendly.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We've been to Touch many several times for dinner and it has always been great. I love Jeff's cooking. The mussels w/frites on top, the Korean sliders & the flatbread w/oven dried tomatoes were all delicious. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Touch whether it's midnight or noon. When I'm out in Ohio City I make it a point to come here. The drinks are reasonable, the bartenders and Staff are friendly and it's a funky, cool place to hang. Haven't had dinner here, but did some here for brunch. We loved our meals. On the menu for our Sunday brunch was the berry foster pancakes and the cornbread and gravy with 2 fried eggs on top. Both dishes were the real deal. The cornbread and gravy was the perfect creamy, spicy, and savory bite. A nice twist on the traditional biscuit and gravy we're used to. The pancakes were awesome. I love pancakes and find myself to be a pancake snob at times, but seriously they were fluffy, melt in your mouth touchalicious. I impressed myself and the waiter and couldn't help but finish one of the gigantic pancakes. Holy cow was I full but I couldn't resist!  Touch had a cool Bloody Mary bar on Sundays which I've never seen before, but it was neat. You can go up and add all sorts of fixings and hot sauces. Pretty cool. Overall, Touch does a bang up job with brunch. They have a funky cool vibe at night that keeps me coming back for more. It's a bit off the main strips of bars, which also makes it a little less crowded. I enjoy this place and will definitely continue to frequent this spot!"}
{"text":"Great food! Drink selection was exceptional, plus the look & ambiance is very modern & sleek. Id stop in again, even if it's soley for the lambic."}
{"text":"This is one place that you LITERALLY have to have heard about... it looks like an abandoned apartment from the street.  No sign.  No address.  Nothing.  I drove past it twice and had to ask someone where it was even with the aide of a smart phone.  Very young/artsy vibe once you get inside though.  I was here for Brunch, so I'm reviewing the Sunday morning brunch experience.  They have a Bloody Mary do-it-yourself bar which I thought was fun.  There was a bit of a wait for a table and the Bloody Mary bar was a fun way to pass the time :)  The menu had some interesting (AKA ironic hipster-y) items like \"Fruity Pebble Pancake\" and \"Champagne and Bacon.\"   I had eggs Benedict, two of my friends got potato pancakes, and one of my friends tried the Fruity Pebble Pancake.  Eggs Benedict were fine.  The potato pancakes were a little bland.  The Fruity Pebble Pancakes were actually the best tasting meal haha  The service was oddly dissatisfying.  One of my friends asked for salt and the waitress smugly said \"Oh no, they add salt on in the kitchen.  You don't need it.\"  When I heard that, my first thought was \"SERIOUSLY!?!  Your standard side dish is TATER TOTS... what kind of elite cuisine credibility are you trying to maintain?!\"  IN SUMMARY:  Overall experience was very good.  Would come back.  Food is fine and cheaper than you'd expect.  Service was below average (but it was very busy to be fair).  Atmosphere is very unique.  Difficult place to find."}
{"text":"So I went here last month for the first time on a Sunday for brunch, sat at the window table in front and had a good experience...food was good and even though the waitress was new she was pleasant. Fast forward to today...AWFUL experience! I was alone so I sat at the bar. The bartender (whose name I believe was Anthony) was so busy giving the only other guy at the bar drink samples that he completely ignored me. Eventually another guy saw me looking around for someone to acknowledge me and asked me if I wanted water and brought me a menu. Anthony kept doing everything else besides acknowledging me at the bar. It was so bad to the point that I asked the other guy if I was able to order food at the bar because I wasn't getting any service. Anyhow Anthony finally came over to take my order...I placed an order for  frenchtoast, I asked him could I sub the fruit for tots he said \"no, the fruit is complimentary\" ummm ok, well let me order tots, eggs and bacon. Then after he told me two eggs were $5 I saw a combo that came with eggs, bacon, tots, beer, and fruit...so I asked \"if I order the combo is it cheaper?\" At this point he got frustrated and said \"it's your meal\". Ugh. Anyhow, food came out, again Anthony nowhere to be found because he is giving another employee a head massage at the end of the bar (yuck, you're  handling food and making drinks...and no he didn't wash his hands). So the other guy was kind enough to bring me salt and pepper ketchup, and extra napkins. Anthony never brought the beer or side of fruit this meal came with and was pretty over it at this point so didn't even worry about it. Food was decent. Needless to say just not a good experience. He acted like I was inconveniencing him or getting on his nerves! So sorry for bothering you! Rest assured my patronage will not be a problem again!"}
{"text":"Remember the days where you listened the radio? When the dj played all the jams and you couldn't sleep or stop groovin'... Whoever he is, from Brooklyn has brought that back, and in Cleveland?! I'm so jealous they don't have this in Miami & Los Angeles.  Imagine going downstairs to a hidden gem  basement and there was a good vibes crowd whom didn't care what else was going on in the world nor how sweaty it was. I sure joined that house party. Tonight proved: Music is universal language, yo.  Why only the one night of the month?!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe great food and my bourbon came with a pancake and bacon. Love Ian he is the best!!!"}
{"text":"I came here under the suggestion that it was \"the best bloody Mary bar in Cleveland\". Unfortunately I will have to disagree. They must have changed something and lowered the number of options. While it isn't THE best, it was still quite tasty and did the trick on a Sunday morning. They are fairly generous with the liquor for being priced around $6 depending on which brand/quality you choose.  I got the chicken and waffles which came with Sriracha which was a nice touch. Also I would try the chorizo gravy; it was top notch. They were tasty. My dining partner got the chocolate chip pancakes and I tell you what they were HUGE and I mean HUGE.   Overall a pretty great brunch experience. We ordered two dishes and four Bloody Mary's total which brought our bill up to around $60, tip included.  I hear the taco night is worth trying as well as free sushi on Fridays? Interesting. I suppose time will tell.."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't review Touch yet. I love this place. I will pick one specific experience to highlight.   I made reservations for Touch Supper Club on a Friday night. We were cranky and tired from a long week of work when my table of 4 arrived. When I say we were cranky, I mean we were short-tempered, irritable, and completely irrational. I didn't even like us. One of my friends sent the waitress to the kitchen to ask the chef if he thought she should order lobster ravioli or a seafood fettuccini. This of course angered me as I actually have dietary restrictions and had a legit question. So within 10 minutes we hated each other and had managed to annoy the chef and waitress. To make matters worse someone thought it would be funny to constantly tease our server that we were going to dine and dash. This was of course funny to us, but horrifying to the waitress who looked at us as people just annoying enough to do that. But the good vibes of Friday melted our tension and by the time the food arrived we had apologized to the server and each other. By the time the apps (fries and mussels) rolled in, the table was a full-on party. The fries came with a mustardy aioli which, although legitimately delicious, we mostly ignored because it seemed like dunking the fries in anything besides the mussel's broth was like gilding the lily. My friend declared that if she had been enjoying the appetizers in the privacy of her own kitchen she would have been tempted to eat the broth in the bottom of the bowl with a spoon. She said it with that crazy look in her eye so we knew that we should move the bowl away from her before she lifted the bowl to her lips and slurped the broth like a kid with his Saturday morning cereal bowl. Just a couple weeks back we had tried the Belgian style fries with mussels at Bar Cento down the street. While the fries are excellent at Bar Cento, the fries/mussels combo at Touch blows away Bar Cento's.   Anyways, we ended up having a great time at Touch, thanks mostly to the good food and accommodating service. My most awkward moment of the night was when I requested the dj to play Tina Turner and he didn't seem to think it was funny. I think he may have actually thought I expected him to play Tina Turner (clearly, I was flirting with him AND had the common ailment of having Turner's \"The Best\" playing on repeat in my head). When he explained that he wasn't a fan of Tina Turner in a fake British accent, I retorted that was crazy in my best British accent. When I got a better whiff of the dj's accent and realized that he was in fact British, I sort of felt like I needed to continue the British accent in order to make it seem like I was also British, and not a socially awkward if not mean American. I don't think it worked though. I don't really mind because how can I worry about what someone thinks who openly decries his dislike of Tina Turner? Later in the evening I was retelling my Tina Turner/British accent faux pas to a potential suitor and he responded that he doesn't like Tina Turner because he \"doesn't think she has intelligent comments when she is judging on that show.\" It took me about 30 seconds before I realized he had Paula Abdul and Tina Turner confused. Really? The day that Hillary Swank wins another Oscar for her roll in the Cold Hearted Snake film portraying the failed love affair of Paula Abdul and Emilio Estevez is the day I will continue a conversation with someone who thinks Tina Turner and Paula Abdul are the same person. I don't think there could be anything more unattractive to me than a guy mistaking any one of Rock and Roll's greats with Paula Abdul. Then again, I would hate to hear what the British house dj thought of a Midwesterner requesting Tina Turner in a faux British accent.  (Touch is slightly hard to spot and I always tell people it is about a block west of W25th on Lorain right before you get to St.Ignatius)."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place on a monthly basis, over the course of the past 10 years. Having not gone in about a year, my girlfriend and I decided to go enjoy a nice bloody mary and some tasty food. However, the food was not as we remembered it. I ordered the chicken & waffles. The waffle was good, but the chicken was overcooked, and was almost black in color. They used dark meat, which I normally enjoy, but this chicken tasted off. There were even gristly bits and fat in it.   My girlfriend ordered the corned beef hash, which had no crispy potato pieces at all. It was mostly a big soggy pile of small potato bits and corned beef.  We also had to wait at the bar for almost 2 hours to get food. They said they were only doing reservations, but there at least 2 empty tables the entire time we were there, with few people at the bar. In that time frame, about 6 plates (including ours) came out of the kitchen. After our food came out, another patron at the bar received her plate, and she promptly returned it, as it was 'ice cold'. She didn't order anything else, as she'd waited over an hour for her plate as well.   I used to consider the brunch at Touch one of the best in Cleveland, but that was not the experience we had today. The servers were very nice, however, and kept our drinks full."}
{"text":"Excellent prep and presentation...the plating's as immaculate as the food! Some of my favorites on the beer/wine list:  Anchor Steam, Dogfish Head Raison D'etre (I took a break from it tonight...been a familiar friend of late), Stone Arrogant Bastard, Dogfish Head 90 minute Imperial IPA, Lucifer Belgian strong pale ale (be warned: this Mechelen ale struts 108% ABV), GLBC Edmund Fitzgerald porter and Old Speckled Hen pale ale.   As mentioned in the last review of 806 Martini/Wine Bar, I've been getting into Chilean malbecs lately. They carried the Terrazas I had at 806, so I went with a few of those, washing down my angus Korean Sliders with the customary Ketel One dirty w/stuffed bleu cheese olives.  I'm not one for sweetbreads, liver and the like. My idea of it all is you can dress anything up, but entrails are still entrails. Just sayin lol. Growing up I detested the gaminess of liver and onions, which adults in the family loved.   Somehow I couldn't help but ask the server about the Chicken \"Liver and Onions,\" strangely curious about the apple cider reduction, crispy fennel and shallots and slab bacon that accompanied. He said he wasn't one for the like either, but recommended the balance between all the components.   So I went for it. The meat was tender and surprisingly not overbearingly gamy, but toward the end I think my palate was reaching its threshold, so I forked the last few pieces onto the Korean sliders, which were nasty good: marinated angus beef with soy, ginger and scallion, pickled Asian vegetables, soy lime ginger aioli and pickled ginger.   Next time I want to try the \"Paper Fried\" chicken wings with pickled radish, house-made Kimchi and asian aioli."}
{"text":"Another great brunch at Touch.  Damn, I wish they offered more coffee drinks beyond standard coffee.  A latte or cappuccino would be nice.  Not even skim milk for coffee.  huge miss!  I think I mentioned this before but their house-made ketchup is awesome.  It has Sriacha in it...yummo.  I got the Eggs Benedict again as did one other person at the table and the other person got a special.  Low ere good.  Service was friendly and attentive, too.  It is nice to see Sunday brunch specials...not a lot of places have them.  Good-looking Bloody Mary bar, too!"}
{"text":"One of the best places we have found in the Cleveland area since moving here 7 months ago. We went to to the late night $5 special thing which runs from midnight to 2 am. This price is cheap, the food is delicious, and the portions are big. That will get you 5 stars every time. We ordered the gourmet mushroom pizza for $5, expecting it to be either tiny or some sort of microwave looking thing, but that couldn't be further away from what we got. It actually was a certified gourmet stone oven baked pizza. I didn't measure the pizza but I can say that I could barely finish one pizza and I am pretty fat, so for most people a pizza and another $5 item would be enough for two people for dinner. We ended up getting the Calamari, Korean Sliders, and a Mushroom Pizza for two people and had to stuff it in our stomachs (no doggy bags for late night deals). With a beer it come to under $20 before tip, which is a great number for getting our taste buds satisfied and our stomachs filled.  The only negative we had was the DJ that night. It was very loud, but I don't think they have music every night, so if you don't like loud music, call in advance to see when to come."}
{"text":"Yet another place where the food is OUTSTANDING but the service is horrific.  I was here for lunch with a large group of friends on a Sunday morning.  We did have a reservation so it wasn't as though they weren't aware we would be coming in.  We even spoke with the manager after our horrible experience who didn't even seem phased by our experience, let alone apologetic.  It's so sad to see this lack of caring when such expertise in the menu is present."}
{"text":"I got 5 on it has to be the freshest party in Cleveland. It's held on the last Saturday of every month. Unfortunately, it's gotten so big, that it's too crowded to 1. order a drink 2. dance or grind (whichever you prefer) 3. stay cool and comfortable. I love coming here for the music. I mean you spend hours cutting up the rug, doing the running man, kid & play, cabbage patch, spitting out all the lyrics to your favorite songs you grew up with in the 90's. And that's really it. There is not really a place like it anywhere else in the 216.  On the flip side, Touch has a decent brunch menu on Sunday and their tacos on Thursday nights... really really underrated.  My dude John Lynch tells me the music on the first Saturdays of every month is worth checking out too."}
{"text":"Brunch is great, Bloody Mary bar, fruity pebble pancakes, mimosas ect. I also like Thursdays taco night and the pizzas. They also have great holiday dinners (NYE, Valentines Day)  But it is a very good idea to get a reservation especially for Brunch. Even if its not busy your table will be set first and waiting for you. Oh yeah the basement music rocks :)"}
{"text":"Best. Happy. Hour. In. Ohio. City.  The most discernible thing about this happy hour is that they give free sushi. Don't get too excited---\"free sushi\" must be TCP slang for \"free cream cheese and rice\". However, I am not one to kick a gift horse in the mouth...and free anything during happy hour is a soggy dream come true. This, by the way, is ONLY ON FRIDAYS.  If you don't like cream cheese and rice, don't be alarmed! There is a well though out happy hour menu that consists of all the necessary eats. Burgers, calamari, half mac, etc. All delicious, and all $5.  The beer isn't a huge deal and if you're going to the happy hour to drink, this might not be your scene. However---if you're there to eat with a fairly low key atmosphere, this is definitely the place for you. The noir is dimly lit and it makes for a cozy place on a cold Cleveland winter afternoon."}
{"text":"After having a lackluster experience at Touch During my first visit, I decided to give them a second try.  One again, I returned for happy hour on Friday.  This time, I made sure to get there at 5:00 to get a good spot at the bar.    In my opinion, Free Sushi Fridays is not worth the trip.  The first batch of sushi didn't actually come out of the kitchen until 6:30 even though happy hour begins at 5:00.  They replenished the sushi once again around 7:00.  Even though we were at the bar in prime seating, I think I was able to eat MAYBE 4 pieces of sushi.  And while it is pretty decent sushi, I don't think it's worth the wait.  To curb our hunger while waiting for the sushi, we ordered the Belgian Frites.  Like our last visit, they were far too greasy.  They almost reminded me of McDonald's fries, to be honest.  Once we realized that there would be a serious lack of sushi, we also ordered the \"Naked\" pizza.  I found it to be too bland and too greasy.  I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but I was sharing it with my boyfriend who will eat any type of pizza you give him, and he said it as nothing special...and definitely not worth the $9 price tag.  Overall, I find Touch Supper Club to be quite overrated and I likely will not return."}
{"text":"Went to Touch Supper Club for drinks and dinner with a friend on a Friday night. The decor is great. Prices are fair, you can certainly do worse in this neighborhood, and the food is very good. I got the steak with parmesan encrusted onion rings (photo to come) could not be happier. She got the lobster Mac & cheese. I sampled this and it was really good too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Reliably one of the best spots in Cle. Food is usually far above average and achieves elite status with other new restaurants in neighborhood that in my humble opinion are overrated. Owner is modest and has sense for entertainment that place hosts standout artists. Techno, older hiphop.Visited for Container perform and was floored big bros. They should try lounging basement more with techno from Berlin. Berghain style Panorama bar with Basic Channel. demon worshiper concierge doesn't work here any longer. Comedy nights are usually very funny. They"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give brunch a try at Touch, brunch being one of my favorite meals. The server gave me strange looks when I walked in, probably due to my unparalleled beauty, either that or my fabulous hat.  The menu was not too crazily varied, if you like eggs, you're in luck.  Although egg whites were available, they were not on the menu.  I went w/ a simple veggie omelet & asked for no cheese or shrooms and rye toast. I'm picky, yeah, but I'm sweet about it. Did I mention that my cuteness lets me get away with more too?  I was sad to see the omelet came w/ cheese and wheat toast.  I felt bad, but had to send it back. Also, I had to request refills every time I needed one.  The server was kind, but just plumb weird.   The food was so-so, the music was good, the service was not great, but I loved the space. I might go back; probably just for drinks.  Touch has potential. Needs some finesse."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! We went here for brunch on a Sunday and it was a great experience. This is definitely a spot I would take someone to if you're showing them the city of Cleveland and that we have a lot to offer in terms of food.  They accommodated our large party well and we were seated instantly. Which is a major selling point when Sunday is just about every restaurants biggest day for brunch.  They brought out waters immediately. They have 10 different flavors of mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar along with an awesome Peach Lambic beer that is very refreshing to choose from.  They have chicken and waffles along with so many other choices with different twists on traditional breakfast food. Most of the entrees are served with fresh fruit. All of the entrees are a pretty good portion too. You can't go wrong with whatever you order  Our service was great as well.  Make sure you check out the pictures!"}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks. Rude staff. First thing that came out of the bartenders mouth was \"this is my first night here\"--as if to apologize for the impending horrible service. I felt bad for her because she was sweet but obviously nervous (and under the harsh scrutiny of her horrible boss).  The manager/otherbartender was just about the rudest, most pretentious person I'd ever met in a food service setting. He spoke to regulars/friends nicely but treated me like I wasn't worthy enough to step foot in his establishment. Didn't smile. Actually, I think I saw him roll his eyes at me. He just seemed to ooze loathing...  One of the hosts for Wednesday open mic stood right in front of me majority of the night so I had to crane my head to see the performers--but his hand gestures were still constantly in my line of sight. Shelby (the entertainment hostess) was the only saving grace tonight: sweet, courteous, professional, and talented.  I don't think I'll be back. Don't exactly like feeling unwelcome and out of place when all I'm trying to do is wind down with some beer and local artists."}
{"text":"For me, the small bonus gestures consistently offered at Touch set it apart. On my first visit, it was an small scoop of a pallet-cleansing sorbet. And, last night, it was a round of shots from the owner. While nominal in cost for the restaurant, the hospitable gestures mean so much to me.  Touch is a perfect choice for thoughtful and well-executed dishes priced well (entrees are in the $9-$16 range, apps between $4-$9.) I can vouch for the Duck Spring Roll appetizer, Warm Mushroom Salad, Hanger Steak, and Burger. All were winners!  The service and atmosphere are relaxed and unpretentious. As the dinner hour passes, Touch transforms into a hip bar scene generally with a dj spinning."}
{"text":"Oh Touch. How I want so much to LOVE you. I like you, I really do. But you must do something about this identity crisis of yours.   First of all, the atmosphere.  You have white linen table cloths and tealight candles in a charming old building with exposed brick. Then you pull out your chair to sit down and it looks like it was left in a room with a starving, leather eating Rottweiler. Are you trying to be classy or shabby chic?  Either way, chairs with the stuffing exposed isn't chic, it's just shabby. And to be clear,  I am not nitpicking a single chair.  There are multiple.   But then I order my food and it's simply delectable. Very yummy, lovingly prepared and even presented in a gourmet fancy schmancy way. As it should...prices are on the moderately high end here. And that's where my conflict comes in...either go all-out divey and reduce the price point, or tidy up the overtly rough edges and go with the classy theme. Either way, I'm cool. Just don't change the food. It's why you keep me coming back.  Happy hour here is where I am happiest to look past my frustrations. They have different food specials that are pretty good and fairly priced. Taco Thursday (not Tuesday!) is probably my favorite,  with a fun and tasty selection. Brunch is also wonderful here (chorizo gravy on corn bread!) but it's also a very busy time. People come for the brunch and stay for a Sunday Funday of build your own bloody marys.   Everytime I'm at Touch I find myself imagining what they could do to fix the weirdness without them having to spend a lot of dough. First suggestion is to not have a hostess except maybe during peak hours. At brunch it makes sense. But walking into an empty restaurant with a hostess that asks if you have a reservation always makes me chuckle. Especially when I say no and she says \"Ok. We can still get you in.\" Really?  Can you? I don't know. Can you squeeze the two of us in here with that one other customer at the bar?  I also talk a big game here. The truth of the matter is I will go back. As I said, I really, really like it. So maybe they don't need to change anything. I don't have to LOVE them. We can be friends with benefits.  Just because Touch isn't the marrying kind, doesn't mean we can't hook up once in awhile, does it?"}
{"text":"I see a lot in the reviews about brunch so I wanted to add a vote for dinner. Great menu overall - good for vegetarians and pescatarians. I had the special, which was a lamb bolognese with very delicate pasta and a meaty, flavorful sauce. Great salads that you can add for only $4. The chop chop was my pick and it was much more interesting than most salads. Nice atmosphere and great service. Also a great drinks menu -- the namesake drink is great for bourbon fans. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Touch it as many times as you like!  You won't go blind...  THE UP-SIDE:  I've been going to Touch, off and on, for years.  I've always liked the place, but it never really stood out, until now.  I'm happy to say that a special holiday four course mea they offeredl was a complete success.  At just $60 per couple, this meal was a tasty steal.  Here's the menu for the evening:   Soup: - Cream of leek soup with potato and parsnip  Salad: - Watercress salad toasted Lake Erie creamery goat cheese, pancetta rosemary vinaigrette (with paired champagne)  Choice of: - Lobster mascarpone ravioli with roasted tomato corn truffle (with paired white wine)  - Rack of lamb with 5 onion risotto, red pepper gastrique, grilled fennel (with paired red wine)  Dessert: - Chocolate molten cake, raspberry gele', white chocolate salted almond ice cream (with paired champagne, different from the first)   Trust me when I tell you, all of the food rocked.  The food tasted fresh, light, and in some case, had a multi-layered taste experience.  The paired drinks were perfectly selected and the service was prompt, friendly, and responsive.    In addition, the clientele at Touch seemed down-to-Earth.  That one is a little difficult to explain, but as I looked around the restaurant, I got the feeling that it was full of \"regular\" folks that would be easy to talk with.    THE DOWN-SIDE:  The ambient temp of the restaurant was a little warm; not too bad, but a little AC might have been good.    THE SUM-IT-UP:  I cannot tell you how nice it was to have a wonderful eating experience, in a hip little establishment, and not feel like my wallet was the prime-objective of the owner."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for dinner and once to drink. Don't ask why I separate the two, but that's how I roll.   Dinner was excellent. Plate presentation was outstanding. Food was devine and walked away a happy foodie.   Drinks are good, they have a pretty good selection. But what made this go from a 4 to a 5 star was the DJ. 80's and 90's music, spinning records and the crowd went wild!!!! I was so impressed that I am going back and bringing friends. They just don't know yet."}
{"text":"Fair quality of service , great food would defiantly go back for more. The location is slightly off the beaten path of west 25th which leads me to believe it has been sort of lost and overshadowed by the neighboring hot spots they have gone in over past 5 years , I always favor the underdog for some reason and prefer charm over places that look like every other 'cool' spot that is duplicated and typically overrated in almost every city that has a decent hipster/young professional population . The menu could use updated to pair better with the current season"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun along with the drinks and Bloody Mary bar. However, food took over 45 minutes to come out once ordered. One of the dishes had extremely undercooked egg over the top of the meal. For the price and wait I probably would not come back. Unique food choices just not fully executed."}
{"text":"brunch again! We usually sit at the bar and eat and drink and eat some more and drink again. The salmon lox are so delicious. The bloody mary bar  is a must. Oh, they had the creme brulee stout on tap too"}
{"text":"On my most recent visit to The Land, I found myself with a handful of girls that needed some brunch after a long night. One of them happened to have a magazine of place to brunch in the Cleveland area. After drooling on a few of the pages, I can across Touch Supper Club. I had heard of them before, but when I saw their signature dish, Fruity Pebbles Pancakes, I immediately made the decision to go there.  Akin to all the eatery's in Ohio City, Touch was a modern chic spot that boasted an amazing menu. From a DIY bloody mary bar, to bacon in champagne (yes, I know, weird) this place had it all.  Seeing as I didn't trust my bartending skills, I decided against the Bloody Mary bar, and daringly went with the bacon in champagne. It was surprisingly good, but make sure you eat the bacon before it gets soggy and ruins the champagne.  For food, obviously I opted for the Fruity Pebble Pancakes, but I also went with the Breakfast bowl of the day, The Southwestern. This concoction was composed of braised beef, 3 eggs, guacamole, smoked mozzarella, black beans, and tater tots. I mean, wow!  Both items were amazing, especially the pancakes, which also had butter infused with fruity pebbles.  Based on the reactions from myself and the 5 other girls, this place was a success. I highly recommend. 5 stars for the creative menu.  FYI, the brunch on the weekends goes til 5pm which makes it much more flexible than most places!"}
{"text":"I am barely aware that they serve drinks.  Was slightly less aware of the allegations that they serve food. I can't imagine wanting to eat here. The place is way too crowded, somewhat stuffy and not really reaching or trying to perfect the \"food\" vibe.  The reason I come here is for the \"Five On It\" nights, where the DJ spins classic 80's and 90's hip-hop down in the basement. If you are ever sore that you weren't an actor or in hip-hop in NY back in the 80's, and therefore didn't star or participate in the movie Krush Groove, this is an instant cure.  Cleveland is one of the most racist places I've been in the U.S. However, you'd never know while cutting floor with easily the most diverse club crowd in the city. Whether you're there to groove with the miss or just chill at the bar to De La Soul, Digable Planets or Tupac (r.i.p.) you'll be welcomed. The best dance party in Cleveland. Maybe the country.   The last Saturday of every month, it gets wicked dope on Lorain Ave."}
{"text":"I love Touch. It is a neighborhood gem that is often overlooked and forgotten about.   We went last Friday for happy hour, arriving around 7p. There were not too many folks in there, most were dining, a few at the bar. The sushi came out while we were there and it was delicious...bacon in sushi?!? Genius. I know people complain about the wait or lack of sushi, but people, IT IS FREE and worth it as an appetizer that costs you nothing.  Nothing compares to the service and food. Our server was wonderful. He was so nice and attentive. When we had questions about vegetarian options he offered to bring the chef out. We told him not necessary but about 10 minutes later the chef came out profusely apologizing for the delay and then talked to the table for about 10 minutes about various dishes and options. My friend, who is a pretty strict vegetarian, had the most questions and he elected to create her a meal instead of having her order off the menu. The chef came out a few more times checking on us and ensuring we liked what he created.  Our food was phenomenal. The Squash Ravioli was packed with flavor, the raviolis themselves were huge and it was savory. The Mushroom gnocchi was chockfull of various mushrooms, creating the perfect sauce to accompany the little gnocchis. The pizza was perfectly crusted and more than enough for 2 meals. And the individualized vegetarian meal? It started with pumpkin bisque that was heavenly. The main course was various small plates made up from veggie options on the menu; cheese and dried fruit, salad, Mediterranean gnocchi, all fantastic. To top it all off, with two Makers drinks, the free sushi, dinner and a tip my meal was still under $35. When asking about drink concoctions the bar delivered. When asked about substitutions and ingredients, the chef catered to us. We asked a lot of questions. We had a few requests. Never did we hear a no. Instead everyone was more than happy to make it a wonderful experience!  I recommend Touch for eating, drinking or dancing the night away. I have never been disappointed and I truly look for the faults in restaurants."}
{"text":"Brunch was so-so. It was more like a bar experience. Brunch options were really basic. We sat in the bar area. The library in the back may have been a better atmosphere. I guess I was looking for something a little more upscale and was disappointed."}
{"text":"Touch has a very concise yet diverse menu that I am still trying to experience all of.  Their short rib dinner and thai basil rice dinner is amazing, the Korean chicken wings are also top notch.  The ambiance and service make it even more of a great Ohio City dining experience.  Phenomenal date night idea."}
{"text":"Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, so there's 2 stars. However, my lox bagel was mushy. We went for brunch on Sunday and treated ourselves to the bloody mary bar (HUGE rip off!). Wasabi and soy infused vodka a plus, but not $8 for a bloody mary where the choices of tomato juice are v8 and cambells, and everything else is just a variety of hot sauces, the glasses are small and you get a ton of ice.  It took forever for our server to bring us our drinks, and remember we were going to end up making them anyways,  and we had to ask twice for our waters. Our table was 7 people so it's understandable, but we got there when all the other tables were getting their checks. The hostess was a better server than our actual server, which shouldn't happen.  So that's why there are only two stars."}
{"text":"I've always come  for the dance parties and never got to experience the food here. I wish i would have done this sooner because the food here is really good! Went here for Sunday brunch and had Eggs Wellington. The food was fresh and although they were busy, the food came out pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Great little bar. I came here for an event and it was a lot of fun. wonderful atmosphere inside. All of the staff was friendly. There is a ground floor and a basement. The basement was a little overly warm. They had a cheese/meat tray with pickled veggies for the event, it was delicious. Not a ton of parking but it's not far from the west side market parking."}
{"text":"This was the WORST $62 I've spent on a meal in Cleveland (and I've ordered a $35 margarita from Zocalo). We had a bad time here. I hate to hate, so let me just go ahead and lay out what happened: 1. Saturday night group of 5 looking to go out in Ohio City. See an opening here on Open Table, have been before awhile ago and think, sure lets try it. (Sound familiar?) 2. We are seated (in this awkward fish bowl experience of a front room).  3. 45 minutes in we have some of the drinks we ordered and finally order our appetizers and meals. Like another review, they were out of things and I had to change my order.  4. We wait wait wait wait and finally ask our server if she can check on our appetizers. When she returns it's clear she never put them in. So we get a rushed soggy calamari and cancel the flatbread order.  5. Moments later dinner arrives.. for SOME of the people at our table. She forgot to put in my dinner order! 6. I order a second drink and they bring me the wrong beer.  7. My steak has the wrong sides. When the veggies come out they were squash and zucchini not Brussels sprouts as we were told.  8. WAAAY later now everyone is done eating and it's time for the check.  They discounted 50% off my steak and that's all. We called the manager over and he said \"Come back again sometime and I'll take care of a drink.\" And proceeded to throw his server under the bus talking about her like a dysfunctional cattle on the farm. They ended up taking off the entire steak order but this was still the worst dinner we've had out in awhile. For real manager dude, take my advice and watch a few episodes of Bar Rescue. These people need a lesson in service from the top down."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp.  Last weekend was the Cleveland Brite Winter Festival.  We chose to go to Touch because they were supporting the festival, unlike some of the other venues in the neighborhood.  Sat at the Bar and the Bartender explained that with one voucher we would each get a free beer and 10% off dinner.  Great service, great food...but when the bill came we had a credit of $3.40.  When I asked the bartender he just shook his head and said that's the deal.  I flagged down the Manager, who came over and the first thing out of his mouth was, \"I understand you a \"Fu*&%#g As*&$^e\".  I tried to explain why I flagged him down, but he just kept screaming at me and telling me he wanted me out of his restaurant.  I'm a 56 year old professional who has never been asked to leave any type of establishment.  Needless to say, I would never recommend this place to anyone.  And it's too bad, because the food was great."}
{"text":"Nope, never again. Went here on a Friday night, just for a couple drinks. Ended up ordering food. Food was actually pretty yummy, BUT the service was one of the worst experiences of my life. Not only did the bar tender essentially throw my plate down on the table, but we were also unfortunate enough to have an incredibly rude and racist woman as our server. It was just.....bad."}
{"text":"I'll keep in touch with this place.  I've been there twice and their food/drinks/entertainment is good! Go there Wednesday and you'll be treated with good independent music!"}
{"text":"As a follow up, I did receive a call from the General Manager, Robert, who was very apologetic for the situation.  While he didn't provide much in the way of explanation as to why this occurred (other than saying that Sunday Brunch is their busiest service), he was very polite and offered to see that any future reservation would be overseen by him.  I am still a bit miffed from the initial interaction, but will more than likely give them another try.  I have been there many times for \"I Got 5 on it\", their 90's hip hop night and it is quite the blast.  I look forward to speaking with Robert personally next time I attend.  Hopefully the results will be better this time."}
{"text":"Waited forever to be seated which was ridiculous considering I saw three open tables. Waiter was clearly not interested in being at work. He got our drink ordered wrong, not just gave them to the wrong people, just wrong. Then was irritated because we didn't want the wrong drinks. Took over an hour to get our food from the time we ordered until delivery, then it was cold. My wife had ordered an additional side which was never brought and we didn't ask for again due to the poor service and attitude up to that point. However, the extra side did materialize on our check. I told the waiter we never got it, he argued with me, I got the manager who offered to give us a free desert. NOT take the side off the check we never got!  We declined and insisted on the removal of the side. After much grumbling the side was removed. We paid and left. When I  checked my credit card bill the charge at Touch was different than my receipt - even with tip. I did the math and realized I was charged for the side anyway. I disputed the charge with my company who gave me credit for the extra charge. I will NEVER go back this place and will tell everyone to NEVER go there."}
{"text":"I came away impressed by Touch Supper Club--high quality food in a cool environment.  I started with the Miso Soup which I really liked.  How much did I like it?  I've been a bit busy to write Yelp reviews the past two months, but here I am at 2:00am on Christmas Day making sure people hear about this soup.  Rather than your usual miso broth and tofu, Touch's version has dumplings (more like \"Chicken and\" rather than \"My wonton soup has\"), tofu, mushrooms, carrots, green onions, and Chinese sausage.  The sausage wasn't the most visually pleasing addition to the soup, but I thought pairing the saltiness of the miso with the Chinese sausage was a great combination.  Plus, there was a slight hint of spiciness that reminded me of Thai tom yum goong without nearly the same amount of heat.  It was one of the better soups I've had in a quite a while.  The Chirstmas Ale Short Ribs weren't quite as impressive, but very tender and still pretty good.  I wasn't sure what to make of the poached egg on top--it looked cool but didn't seem to add anything taste-wise.  The dish comes with two chef sides, but the only one I remember at the moment were the green beans, which were just okay (but at least you got your veggies in).  From my fellow diners, I heard good things about the Seafood Feast and the Delirium Mussels (having the appetizer as a main course).  All of the desserts were pretty big--more than enough to share with someone else.  The Bananas Foster was judged by the table to be the best dessert among a Cherries Foster and Flour-less Chocolate Cake.  I thought the bananas could have been a little sweeter, but it was pretty good overall.  Don't hold your breath for a tableside preparation.  Service was solid--our server seemed overly apologetic even when nothing had gone wrong, but I'd much rather have that then bad, inattentive service.  Touch was featuring a pretty impressive beer list (not sure whether this was a special feature for the holidays).  The wine menu is relatively reasonable--bottles starting around $20 and topping out at about $80 except for a few bottles you hear about in rap songs (a $250 Opus One and a $400 Cristal).  The restaurant decor gives off a cool vibe, which adds to the experience.  I like the location--close enough to West 25th for après-dinner drinks and frivolity."}
{"text":"After reading earlier reviews I was a little hesitant about going to Touch for dinner, there is nothing  I hate more than bad service...  But WOW I could not relate to any of those past reviews! The food at Touch Supper Club is out of this world!! My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday, which is their gourmet taco night, he got 3 different tacos and  I got the spicy peanut pizza. With having a severe fish allergy I am always worried about cross contamination and they keep  their standards high when making sure there were no problems. The staff was wonderful!  Service was beyond what I could have asked for and the food was out of this world!   I WILL be going back!"}
{"text":"There is a time and a place for everything.  This mantra holds true for most things, including Touch.  A word from the wise:  Go to Touch for. . .  1. Friday Happy Hour (aka Free Sushi and great drink specials until 8pm) 2. They're infamous \"I've Got Five On It\" where dj's spin old school hip hop to an energetic wall to wall crowd 3. Any random weeknight for a drink and a bite to eat. The bar is laid back and never crazy busy, the menu is creative yet cheap and happy hour runs from 4-8pm Tuesday thru Friday  Do not go to Touch for. . .  Sunday Brunch. You may be tempted by their Bloody Mary Bar and lured back time to time.  But, remember, the service is beyond horrible on Sunday afternoons.  Be prepared to wait and wait and. . .wait. The Brunch menu is hit or miss - not worth the time and frustration.  Perhaps give a try. . .  Taco Thursdays - $3 tacos or 2 for $5 (chicken, beef, and seafood).  I have yet to experience, but have heard good things and will stop by on a Thursday soon.  Will follow-up with a review when I do so."}
{"text":"When we made our reservation, we spoke with Chef Jeff Fisher who introduced himself and and told us to ask for him when we arrived.  After asking for special dietary needs, he promised to create something great for us.    Our high expectations turned sour when we arrived and were seated in the bar area instead of the dining room.   After nearly 20 minutes passed without a server, we asked the hostess for assistance.  We mentioned that we'd spoken to the chef who told us to mention it was our first visit.  She nodded and said, \"Yes, he's the chef,\" but she must not have said anything because we never saw him.     We ordered the Belgian Frites as an appetizer.  The fries were somewhat limp, but the the garlic aioli dipping sauce was divine.   We ordered the specials, halibut and rib eye,  which didn't have prices listed.       Over an hour later, our food arrived but we agreed it wasn't worth the wait.  The halibut was well cooked and topped with an acidic tomato sauce, but the fish was bland and needed seasoning.    The steak was large, generally flavorless and contained a lot of gristle and fat.  I've had better steaks at a $9.99 chain buffet.    Our waitress was busy and it was hard to grab her attention.  Towards the end of our meal, we declined more wine and asked instead for water. She nodded and brought more wine.     Several hours later, we received our bill and saw that our steak was $38 and the halibut $27.  Reasonable prices for an excellent meal with great service and ambiance, but not a barely average one with inattentive service in a bar with Andy Griffith playing on the TV."}
{"text":"I've gone to Touch for many years and have never had a complaint.  They recently re-opened after being closed for more than a year.  I couldn't wait to go and have dinner there.  Well, on Friday a friend and I went and I must say that the experience was subpar and the food was not good.  After being closed for a year, I would have thought that they would have had a new menu...but nope, it was the same.  No biggie though because I ordered my fave (grilled cheese with copa, soup and french fries) and the sandwich was burnt on one side, cold and with just enough cheese to make the two pieces of bread stick together.  Soup cold and the french fries weren't cooked all the way and were also cold.  I told the server and she quickly got sidetracked by someone yelling for her and walked away.    I'm hoping that things improve....and that maybe they just aren't up to their old standards because they just re-opened.  I'll go again....and hope for a better experience, but I'll wait at least a month."}
{"text":"This place really packs a punch! Rocking DJ's,  dance floor, lounge, restaurant, good food, late night food, great drinks, affordable, great diversity, and  excellent service.  Not sure who was spinning but it was one of the best DJ's I have experienced in the CLE!  This place really  has a good vibe. I ordered a dirty martini, it was perfect. filled to the rim. I asked for something girly with vodka for a friend. I sipped it and it was very good. I usually hate sweet drinks. The drinks were under 10$.  The was the perfect follow up to the Banff Film Fest!"}
{"text":"I signed up for a Yelp account specifically to write a review of Touch after my brunch experience today. The food was actually quite good. But the service might be the worst I've ever experienced. Ever! Granted, I was there with a large group (12) and I know it was Sunday brunch. But we also made reservations Wednesday. They knew we were coming. Yet we still had just one server, and he was either brand-new, completely stoned or didn't care. It took us about 3 hours to complete our brunch. We didn't even get our drinks until we'd been there an hour. How difficult is it to pour a cup of coffee? And we had to get up numerous times to 1. request water, 2. request sugar for our coffee, 3. to request salt and pepper, and 4. to request refills on water and coffee.   Worst of all, when I finally decided to approach a manager -- who also was the owner -- after we'd sat through about 2 hours of this debacle, he was dismissive. I began my conversation by conceding that we had a large party and it was a busy Sunday brunch, but perhaps he might have been better to assign two servers to our table, or at least one who was somewhat attentive. He told me that we were at fault because we added two more to our party's reservation yesterday. So that's what made the difference? I don't think so. At least three people in our party didn't get what they ordered (vegetarians were given meat on their breakfast sandwiches), and I never got the side of bacon I ordered -- even though it was on my bill. I was so fed up and eager to leave that I just paid for it.  They're lucky they got 2 stars from me -- that's only because the food was quite good. When we finally got it, that is.   I pretty sure that Touch just lost 12 frustrated customers."}
{"text":"I've only been to Touch at night for drinks, friend gathering and late night dinner food. All have been good experiences!  Sometimes the downstairs are open, like recently for my friend's birthday, and that's cool, there is a nice fish tank and dance area as well as a bar. Upstairs is the usual hangout. The bar is great, service is usually spot on and interested in you liking your drink.  Often there are DJs keepin the tunes rockin and a little spicy for a tasty night! On the artistic side, sometimes they even have great artwork showing. Always a plus for discussion and atmosphere.  The food is wonderful. My friend works in the food industry and she says the chef is really talented...well she's right. The food is yummy and you can eat there until what seems like almost closing (which is usual bar time.)   The scene is hip and trendy without all the attitude. Good times!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch, for reals. Bloody Mary bar, a good mix a savory and sweet breakfasty options, decent service. I've gone back several times for a Sunday nosh!  I get a wonky vibe from the place at non-brunch times, but maybe I'm being ignorant."}
{"text":"The service was good, apart from having to request refills repeatedly. But the food is so overpriced for what is offered - the most lackluster of which is the bacon champagne. While seemingly interesting and unique, it is a huge disappointment. One does nothing to complement the other.   The entrees we ordered were the fruity pebbles pancakes, chorizo and cornbread and steak, egg and cheese bagel.  The highlight were the fruity pebbles pancakes. They are served in a huge helping with a distinct and familiar fruity pebbles taste. Delicious.   The chorizo dish was overwhelmingly salty. But otherwise it paired well with the soft cornbread.  My biggest gripe is about the steak, egg and cheese bagel sandwich. It was served with crispy tots. (Thumbs up on that part.) but the steak itself was overdone, tough and hard to chew, which made it terrible for a sandwich. The \"special sauce\" tasted like a thousand island dressing.  The food was not worth the cost. This place was a huge disappointment but it might have just been what I ordered."}
{"text":"Just went to this place for the first time recently for brunch, I know where have I been, but I saw that they had a Bloody Mary bar so I decided to try it.  The food and Bloody Mary's were fantastic and the food was great.  I tried the eggs benedict and the fruity pebble pancakes and they were excellent. The fruity pebble pancakes were so good I had to force myself to stop eating them because they are massive. I surely will be going back."}
{"text":"This is a review for old school hip-hop night.  Takes place on the last Saturday of every month.  It's super fun!  I love the music! It can get super hot down there and it's a bummer there's a $10 cover (in Cleveland, really??) but if you go every now and then it's worth it for a good time."}
{"text":"I have been here twice recently for brunch. The first time I had the garbage omelette. It was delicious!. It was filled with everything under the sun including tater tots! I loved it! I had a make your own Bloody Mary to drink which was great.  Many choices of hot sauce and other fixings to really make the cocktail suit your tastes.   The next visit I had a really delicious huevos rancheros with chorizo gravy and a mango mimosa.   This is definitely a favorite brunch place!   Fast, delicious food and no wait!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't get more stars. Justin at touch always gives us MORE than exceptional service and is always in touch with our needs. See what i did there? And the brunch.....HOLY SH!T! However, I've only been there for brunch. Their fruity pebble pancakes are out of this world. I've been there the past 2 weeks for brunch and considering going again today! They have a HUGE bloody Mary bar and a list of mimosas that will make you want to try every single one of them, not without a dd of course. Also, if you're into bacon (who isn't!?) they have a drink called bacon and champagne. They literally put a hot piece of bacon in a glass of champagne. It's delicious! Please please please give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went today for Sunday brunch. Really enjoyed the fruity pebbles pancakes. My girl got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was okay (it was tempura not fried), but the waffle was EXCELLENT. She also enjoyed the pineapple and mango flavored mimosas. Roger was our server and he was great. Would recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"Place is kinda cheesy..no, really cheesy..  It reminds me of all the people who wana relive the Aqua, Grovee and Spy Bar days..  Let it go peoples.  Only good time, really is when Terry drops in to spin some old school stuff for me and the Toucher..  Order your drinks 2 at a time.  The kids they have down there have two speeds...slow...and I m too cool..."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. My husband and I sat at the bar. I said I would like the Bloody Mary bar. The bartender(at least that what he called himself) did like that I asked for well and made it know. I asked about some of the topping on the menu and was told everything was an extra charge if they had to go to the kitchen. Good was dropped off and never checked on or asked if we need or want we anything else. We sat for 20 minutes with empty plates and drinks while the staff bad mouthed another employee. Oh did I forget we were the only 2 at the bar and ok y 2 tables in the dining room. Not going back."}
{"text":"Always enjoy myself here. Whether I'm alone, or with a group of friends, it's always a new experience. The food has never disappointed and the drink menu has something for everyone. The attitude from the staff can be a little relaxed, but if you learn to relax yourself, you'll fit in just fine. If you're a nitpicker on a time crunch, this isn't the place for you. If you have time to enjoy yourself, you will."}
{"text":"I had been to Touch Supper Club a few times for dinner with friends and remembered it for the good food and fun vibe.  Recently I had been looking for a good brunch spot.  For some reason I have a hard time finding local brunch spots that offer eggs benedict so when I saw it on Touch's brunch menu, my decision had been made.  Touch did not disappoint.  The menu is filled with creative spins on traditional breakfast items like fruity pebble pancakes and bacon mimosas and their bloody mary bar is no joke!"}
{"text":"Went in this past Sunday for brunch and wasn't too impressed. The place is beautifully decorated and the atmosphere is nice. Our waiter was pleasant, but not attentive.  We ordered: Chicken & Waffles, the Mexican omelet and the Eggs Norwegian.  1. Chicken and waffles = pretty standard. They drizzle the syrup over both the chicken and waffles before bringing it out, so if you don't like that, ask for syrup on the side.  2. The Mexican omelet wasn't bad. A lot of chorizo, so if you like more meat than egg ratio, you'll enjoy it.  3. The Eggs Norwegian was disappointing. My \"poached\" egg was overdone and english muffin was barely toasted so it got soggy quick er than anticipated."}
{"text":"I'd like to write a real review of this place, but that's difficult to do - their hours are 11am-1am on Saturdays, yet at 12 they appeared to be completely closed down.  My friend and I had gone out of our way to go specifically to this place - later that night she called to find that they're not out of business but just weren't open at that time.  Kind of a crappy thing to do to your customers.  Stick to your hours, jerks."}
{"text":"\"Free Sushi Fridays?\"  Really?  Free?  On Friday we all headed to Touch Supper Club to try out this mythical free sushi.  We soon realized though, that one cannot subsist on free sushi alone.  I was wondering what the catch to having a free sushi night was, and this is it:  Sure the sushi is free, but it takes a long time to be made, and when it does get served it is on a platter that will give 7-10 people enough pieces to make it like an appetizer.  Considering how many people actually are at the bar on Fridays, that does not allow for a lot of people to eat sushi at any time.    The sushi itself, pretty good.  They have the California-type rolls with faux crab and avocado, some tuna rolls, as well as some nice flavorful sashimi.    For dinner itself, the meals I tried weren't too impressive.  The Korean burger, while tasty, is not Korean!  Said by my Korean friend herself.  The burger is marinated in a teriyaki-like sauce, with pickled veggies Japanese-style (daikon and carrot).  At the very least, I was hoping for a bulgogi type marinade, or kimchi instead of sweet pickled daikon and carrot.  I mean sure, just the fact that you are asking for a Korean burger is not crying out for authenticity, but really, no element in this burger was Korean at all.    I also had some of the grilled cheese sandwich, which was very filling, and came with some tomato bisque and fries.  All decent tasting, but I'm not sure I'd go here again for a $10 grilled cheese sandwich when I could probably get a better tasting grilled cheese sandwich for about the same price at Melt.  My main problem with the food is that it took a long time to actually get served to us.  We were starving and it took forever to just get our appetizers.  The server also did not count out the number of extra glasses and silverware settings we needed, so we had to ask for extra settings to get any water or silverware for those lacking it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate dinner here last night, after a few failed restaurant attempts we went to touch.   We walked in and there were a decent amount of people in the front 2 rooms and we got seated right away by the dj.   I ordered one of the seasonal drinks, and they were actually out of the alcohol, so the bartender made me a special martini and it was delicious. The drink my gf got (some name with sunny) was delicious as well.   I ended up getting the chicken paprikash and it was TO DIE FOR. GET THIS.   My gf got the butternut squash risotto. And it was so so good.   All in all it was a great first experience. Thursday night is usually taco night, and every time they went by they looked amazing. Definitely stop in here if you are looking for some great food and drink."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch at 11 am on a Sunday and really enjoyed ourselves! It was not busy at the time and it was super cozy where we sat. The breakfast burrito was delicious and I had fun making a Bloody Mary at the Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"Amy T. you review goddess you.  She did a great job with her review.  I LOVE the mussels and frites here, what about their special sauce??  Isn't that one fantastic number!  Still one of my favorite places for a fried egg burger.  Listen up girls, try their grilled cheese, OMFG.....huge and gooey, dip that in their tomato bisque, good God.  I've also tried the mac and cheese which is really rich and good.  I love the fact that this place looks like a POS restaurant but when you go in you feel like taking your foot out of your mouth.  Must try.  Best yet, there is nudie art on the walls, what a plus that is huh?  Check out their website, I believe they have been voted best happy hour on Fridays for free sushi.  Jeff Fisher is gone out to start another endeavor but left his recipes behind.  Get out and get you some!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Touch a couple of times now and we haven't been disappointed.  The restaurant is somewhat small, but it's not been overly crowded anytime we've been there.  The bar is great and the bartenders make up some wicked cocktails.   Bonus!!  The food here is quite tasty.  I highly recommend the Asian sliders for an appetizer.  The pickled ginger to top them with is fantastic and really \"punches up\" the flavor of the beef.  For dinner, I've had the hanger steak and lobster mac & cheese...delicious!!  My husband had the Christmas Ale short ribs which were very tender and not dry at all.  At our last visit, hubby had the salmon with spinach risotto and there was nothing left when he was done.   The only reason I gave Touch 4-stars instead of 5 was merely because the waiters/waitresses seem to be oblivious to proper restaurant etiquette.  After my husband and I finished our Tempura bacon salad, we left our forks on the plate.  A waiter came by to take the plate and told my husband and I to take our forks off of the plate.  Seriously, you couldn't just bring us two new forks????  Minor offense, but for the price you pay to eat there, I think it's worth noting."}
{"text":"this is an extraordinarily long overdue review. I have been to Touch on to two occasions, both of which were over 3-4 years ago. the first occasion was fine, a typical saturday night in ohio city, nothing to write home about. like everyone else has mentioned, for the horrific service, the price point is WAY too high. I want to say we paid $25 per shot of patron. anyways, the reason i'm even wasting my time further on this place is to inform everyone of what a horrible experience I had the second time I visited.   a group of friends and I went to Touch on hip hop night, so let your imagination determine the caliber of people that brought it. I read from other reviewers that they closed for a year so I don't know if they still have this but they used to and I can't remember what day it was on but that's besides the point. the hip hop music was exclusive to the lower level where dancing was happening. we went down here and had a good time for awhile... until there was a short hispanic man, 25-30 years old, who was groping girls, myself included, and trying to touch their crotches. after everyone telling him to get lost and him not taking no for an answer I finally told him to f*ck off and then turned around. assuming that he got the hint, I continued dancing with my friends until he PUNCHED ME IN THE HEAD. no exaggeration whatsoever, punched me so hard in the back of the head i was knocked unconscious and fell to the ground. when I woke up, my friends were standing around me while i was sobbing uncontrollably and the guy had ran upstairs and left. we all ran upstairs after him and to notify the police officer who was working the door. this is where it gets even worse. the police officer couldn't have cared less... in fact, he told me to sit down on a bench and \"shut up\". you would think he would suspect something was wrong when a man went flying out of the door and ran away, but no, he wasn't interested at all. meanwhile, a softball size knot is forming on the back of my head. I called my parents, who live all the way in willoughby hills, and they came immediately. at the point of their arrival, the place was closing. my mother and father got out of the car and knocked on the door to talk to the manager or whoever was left in charge that night only to be told to leave! I cannot make this up. they literally told my parents to go away and shut the door in their faces after they asked if there were any cameras in the basement in hopes that the incident would have been recorded. I have never been so disgusted by an establishment in my LIFE. id also like to mention the fact that the officer was black and treated me as I was some dumb white airheaded bimbo who made the entire story up for fun. perhaps if the races were reversed, the entire population of the city would be up and arms screaming racism and rallying in the streets.   we immediately went to the police station and they told us all we could do was file a police report against the officer, who the managers would not tell us the name of the officer working the door that night. defeated, we ended up going to the police station again the next day and they figured out who it was and we filed a report. as you can imagine, nothing came of it. my parents and I considered suing Touch, but decided it wasn't worth it and I moved to NYC two months later.   I would absolutely positively NEVER set foot in this place again. I can only hope and pray that they have new management for the sake of the rest of the general public but I can promise you that I will personally NEVER find out for myself. this place and the people involved that night are utterly and truly sickening and I cannot help but think about it every time I drive by and think what a POS this place is."}
{"text":"I wish I could choose 3.5 stars. I've gone twice to Touch Supper Club for brunch, both time the food is good but the service is lacking.   Sunday at noon, two friends and I get seated right away. No waters come. I get a coffee, friend 1 gets a beer and friend 2 decides to do the bloody mary buffet. The drinks come fine. Ordering went well, it was after our food come that was disappointing. Our waitress walked past twice to drop off menus at the hostess stand without coming to our table to check on us. She only gave us ketchup in tiny dishes and we all needed more. I needed more coffee. I finally got a water after I was done with my meal.   The food was good, I got the eggs vegetarian (caprese eggs benedict) with a side of tater tots. Love tater tots, huge fan! If someone suggest going to Touch Supper Club for brunch I would say 'yes' but I will not be the one suggesting it."}
{"text":"This place was nice for an early saturday dinner. I felt like we were probably a bit underdressed, not that this is a shirt and tie must kinda place, and had a baby with our party and they were still really nice and helpful.   We started off with the mussels, they were excellent. Only complaint really is that they didn't bring a spoon to get more broth but oh well I lived. I had the touch burger, it was really really good. If you have read any of my other reviews you might know I am a bit of a burger snob. It came out cooked perfectly medium rare! The taste of the beef was excellent.   The only knock I had was the service was slow, however having said that it appeared that they had a large party in the front and a large party in the back all at the same time so I guess Ill let it slide."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch today with some friends since I have never been.  We waited quite a while to be sat, which is understandable as there were seven of us.   The server seemed nice, but a bit flighty.  Everything took a ridiculous amount of time. Drinks, food, checks, literally everything.  At the end of the meal we had to have another server cash us out, as ours disappeared into another room with less people in it.    The food was great but not worth the horrible service.  We get it.  You're hung over and don't want to be working brunch, but that is no excuse to be that bad at your job.  Sorry Touch, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Make sure you Touch this Club! Wow was that lame. Touch Supper Club on the other hand, is not lame. The moment you walk in, at least when I walk in, the adrenaline just starts pumping the moment you walk in to the I Got 5 On It party (last Saturday of every month)! The gist of details (main one is a cover charge after 10 pm and I feel like I've been charged anywhere from $5 to $10, FYI) is pretty standard. You are greeted to chill 90s hip hop and R&B on the first floor. There's a full service bar and large tables across from it. It's narrow up there, but it's spacious compared to the real party downstairs! You'll eventually bounce between the two floors to get a breather, believe me! Basically the chill 90s music upstairs is turned to the all the top hits from 90s hip hop in the basement! There's a bar down there too, about half the size as upstairs. It really is a basement party set in the 90s. There are a few lounge areas down there, but everyone is up and dancing. If you're claustrophobic, you'll most likely not be a fan of the downstairs craziness. But if you love everything from Biggie to 2pac, from TLC to SWV, you'll have a blast!  I can really only vouch for the bar and dance experiences. I remember they used to have sushi deals (good sushi!) each Friday as a happy hour promotion, but I'm not sure if it's still running. If you're trying to pivot away from the standard 25th bars and need to switch it up, you really can't do much better than making your way over to Touch!"}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe how it all started. My par y ma group of 4 of us. We're sat in the little privAte dining room and a dirty table with no silverware. No I know. That's one of the first things to do when being sat. After we were sat we waited minutes to be offered beverages which were decent. All the meals say they come with fresh fruit which they ran out of. Which I also found it hard to believe considering they are located .3 of a mile away from the west side market where  here is endless fruit there. You do the math. Also I ordered a bagel which wasn't plain It was the everything bagel which I did not like so I was offered 2pc of wheat toast which I didn't eat and was still charged  $3 for it. Very disappointing we won't be back. We should have continued on Lorain to nicks diner !!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is absolutely outstanding. They have \"different\" food items that are still very very good. Brunch ends at 5pm on a Sunday. How bomb is that?   I have yet to come for Dinner... but I will be doing that soon!"}
{"text":"Touch has a lot to offer!! Great place for a happy hour, or to go dancing! Their food is consistently very good also. Great specials on food such as taco night, burger night, and free sushi night! Also some fun dance/music nights happening in the basement. One of my favorites is the \"I Got 5 On It\" -- a 90's hip hop dance night held monthly. The only draw back is it can get extremely crowded.... or is that an upside? :) Great DJ's too. I have had many good times on that dance floor.   They also offer brunch although it's been my experience that it's a bit slow so I stopped coming for that. Nice Bloody Mary bar though! They also have fabulous dinner ...and sometimes dining events. The atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable. I miss Rock Night on Thursday. Very friendly and attractive staff.   All in all an A+ establishment. I would recommend it highly to anyone who has never been.   Note: Coat check in the winter is a plus."}
{"text":"Touch is quickly becoming my favorite brunch spot in the area. My boyfriend and I have been searching for the perfect place to go routinely, and I think we found it! The service is always fast, friendly, and accommodating. I really enjoyed the Corned Beef Hash, My boyfriend said the Benedict was alright. The breakfast sandwich is okay, but nothing to write home about. It's really just a fun place, with a fun bloody mary bar and great staff."}
{"text":"great brunch! loved the fruit pepple pancakes and the mimosas!"}
{"text":"Touch was stretching for something out of its reach.    This isn't fine dining.  It's more like a nice mid-range place to eat.  It should have embraced that. I was a bit concerned when I noticed that the price for a \"aphrodisiac\" four course meal that included 3 glasses of wine was $30.  I was even more concerned when the wait staff consistently referred to Mon cher chou and I as \"you guys\" and the bus boy was completely befuddled by the whole silverware situation.  The food wasn't bad at all, really.  Some dishes were very good.  It was particularly onion-y for something touted as a romantic dinner.  We started with an onion-y blini as an amuse bouche, then on to an onion-y leek soup.  Both tasted like something your Irish mam would make you on a cold night.  Nice and homey.    The watercress/ pancetta salad was delish.  They should have found some younger watercress, but the dressing and the goat cheese were well executed and balanced to the peppery nature of the watercress.  The accompanying champagne was very sweet.  My lamb chops were perfectly medium rare and very juicy.  The rissoto-ish accompanyment tasted much like the soup-- just onion-y.  The standout was the red pepper sauce-- really vibrant, with a hint of mustard and not onion-y.  The accompanying wine was very soft and uncomplicated.  Mon cher chou's lobster ravioli was quite delicious.  The raviolis were packed with more lobster than marscapone and filler.  How refreshing!  Dessert-- ah molten lava cake.  Weirdly enough, it didn't taste like Sysco's ubiquitous offering.   Impressive-ish.  Unlike the center of the cake, though, the ice cream was rather liquid, as was the truffle, but both were tasty in their liquid state.  The accompanying rose champagne was well matched to the sweets.  So all in all, tasty.  Not as impressive as they were trying to be.  I would go back, but in jeans, rather than Escada."}
{"text":"upon the recommendation of my server, i ordered the fruity pebble pancakes that arrived at my table smothered in fruity pebble infused butter with a tater tot sidecar.  the two pancakes were about the size of my head [fairly large], rainbow speckled with cereal, and fluffy as can be.  honestly, i was hesitant to order this dish as i'm not even a huge fan of the cereal, but i am extremely happy with my decision to be an adventurous bruncher.  i also tried the vegetarian eggs benedict, which were flavorful and more exciting than expected.  traditionally, a vegetarian pass at this brunch staple falls short in taste due to a lack of spiciness or saltiness [typically provided by bacon / sausage / ham], but touch's semi-italian, caprese-esque take on this dish was great.  i really enjoyed the inclusion of mozzarella & tomato, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  i was not in the mood to drink [unusual], but the bloody mary bar appeared stocked with much variety for both the hot sauce and topping enthusiast alike.  my mom ordered a mango mimosa, and a peach mimosa- both delicious and a good size."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Touch for Taco Thursdays.  It wasn't super busy and we got a table by the bar in about 5 minutes.  The taco deal is 2/$5 for 1 for $3.50.  They also have specials on cocktails.  The service was attentive and the tacos were really good!    We each ordered 4, which was way too many! They are bigger than other places that have taco specials.  They, also, have all sorts of, um, interesting tacos - like mac n cheese -  but the chorizo was my favorite!  They seem to enjoy putting sour cream on everything, so be sure to ask if you aren't a fan!  Overall, I would definitely recommend checking Touch out for Taco Thursdays!  Or, ya know, don't... because then it will get super busy like all my other favorite taco days!"}
{"text":"As many have written before me, I Got 5 On It is the dance party celebrating 90's rap music on the last Saturday of every month. I could honestly do a way better job as far as the music selection goes. They played C-Murder on one occassion and that was great because my friend lost his mind. I want to open up a bar that only plays this type of music because once a month is not enough. And I would be playing: Master P-Bout It, Above the Law-Black Superman, Craig Mack-Flavor in Your Ear, Mystikal-The Man Right Chea, Do or Die-Playa Like Me and You, Too Short-Gettin It, Lil Troy-Wanna Be a Baller, Dove Shack-Summertime in the LBC, Wu-Tang-C.R.E.A.M, Ice Cube-Today Was a Good Day, Mobb Deep-Anything off Infamous or Hell on Earth, and anything from Doggystyle or Chronic. That would get the party \"wild for the night\"."}
{"text":"Brunch is fantastic! The Bloody Mary bar is a must! The chorizo omelet is very tasty. All of the brunch entrees come with crispy tater tots, which is fun!   Happy hour is also pretty amazing! The Asian inspired eats are always satisfying, especially the sliders! The mushroom salad is great too!   This is not, however, a sushi restaurant. Don't get me wrong, you can sushi here, but is you're craving good sushi, go elsewhere.  Overall - yum and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary Bar fans should check this place out. A lot of people were here for that which made service, if you wanted the bartender to make it for you, slow. The outside doesn't look super inviting but the inside is just the opposite. I didn't see the basement I've been hearing about being here just for brunch, but the inside is definitely nice - especially the back room where we got to sit. Very comfy: pillows making up the back of the benches, a wall of bookshelves... Good food - I got the Mexican Omelet. Friendly staff. The bartender even came around when he had a chance asking if drinks were okay."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding, I've never been disappointed each time I eat here. 2 big thumbs up for the chef. The staff is super nice and the place is my all-time favorite. I always look forward to bringing friends here to eat or listen to some cool music"}
{"text":"If i could i would give it two and a half stars. I've been here twice. The first time was pretty good, it was late on a Thursday night my gf and I went after going to the bar and were hungry. We got the naked pizza which was pretty good a little too much garlic but still good. As far as atmosphere it was dead and we sat at the bar with only a few people upstairs but there were many downstairs for an event. Our bartender was nice and provided great service.  After the first time I would have rated it either a 3.5 or a 4 out of five. The second time going there was just straight creepy, and not sure I will ever go back. It was their taco night which I was hyped for after having a few drinks at The Old Angle on west 25th. Strange music by the dj was playing, and just an overall creepy atmosphere including a mannequin with angel wings on the bar. This isn't a Victoria Secret fashion show on acid...After ordering a drink we left without even getting the tacos. Our server was okayish."}
{"text":"In the last Sat of the month this place holds an event called,\"I Got 5 on it.\" Its a hot, sticky, dark basement hosted by a DJ playing 90s rap, it is a 50/50 shot wether it will be fun as fuck or one of the worst nights ever.   Take that how you want to, I just call em' how I see em'. I have been here in legendary nights and I have attended this function and left thinking going down a razor-blade slide into a pool if alcohol might have been a better time.   The bars up and down stairs can get super busy and they seem to always have slow bartenders. Not a good combo. The music is good, 90s rap is unreplacable in my eyes.  In the words of Celph Titled - Miss Those Days. \"I give a mother F****** million dollars to go back.\" The 90s were the shit, I wouldn't have it any other way I love growing up in that time period. It was the only period people wore backwards clothes on purpose.    http://youtu.be/Tpxt9rJSGkk"}
{"text":"Friday, Friday, Friday!  My favorite thing about Touch is that on Friday's, they have free sushi!  The sushi is actually pretty good too!  Most have cream cheeses and sauces on top, so this isn't the place if you're expecting sushi chef quality, but Mmmm...they are good!    On top of the free sushi, are Touch's great HH priced drinks and apps.  It's a great place to stop in after work, and a great way to start off the evening."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience at touch. We had an issue with the food and service. We asked to speak to the manager and he got extremely defensive and offered nothing to help improve our poor experience. He actually started to yell at us. So I yelled back, settled what I owed him, and left.  I am sticking to my guns, and won't be back, I will spend my money Where the manager actually appreciates my dollar."}
{"text":"Third time to Touch. Service was great. Ordered the tempura green beans, and the wedge salad. Which the server had divided for two. Thanks. Now the entrees. Pork chops, done very well. Moist, good . But underneath??? A burnt mix of sweet potato and what?  The baby bokchoy was over cooked, very slimy. I love bok choy. I was hoping for some crunch. The hanger steak was cooked..to well. Though we asked for med. And the risotto was good. I love Touch, and  that's why I choose it for my friend's b-day dinner. All around good place. Just don't  burn stuff."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service.  I went here for the \"Make Your Own\" Bloody Mary Bar.  It was packed, which is unusual for a Cleveland establishment.  The hostess told us it would be 5-10 minutes for a table, which was fine with us, so we went to the bar to get our first Bloody Mary.  The bar is very small, yet it was staffed with 2 bartenders.  It was full with 8-10 people, and we waited nearly 10 minutes for the first acknowledgement from anybody.  The hungover bartender with \"bed head\" finally looked at us and simply said, \"Hello\".  We asked for 2 drinks and 5 minutes later he handed them to us.  At this time, the hostess informed us our table was ready.  We sat down and ordered brunch.  When I finished my first drink, I ordered another and 20 minutes later, it arrived.  My girlfriend ordered a second drink a little while later, and in about 25 minutes, it arrived.    I ordered a dish with pancakes, fried eggs, and bacon.  The eggs tasted like fish, the bacon sucked, but the pancakes were excellent.  I had to get up and find the waitress to obtain salt/pepper, and I had to get up a second time to hunt down my girlfriend's second drink.    The entire staff appeared hungover, and nobody was very friendly.  The Bloody Mar Bar was great, lots of stuff to choose from."}
{"text":"Minimal dance venues in Cleveland, so on my short list of places to be gettin' Jiggy wit it, Touch Supper Club tops my list.   Parking: choose between free local street parking or go across the street and park at the free lot (which is across from St. Ignatius)  Cover charge: Free before 10pm, after that $5 which is still very meager, coming from a person who was born and raised in LA.   Venue: Can get very full and very fast. I've seen lines around the corner in blistery winter weather (that should tell you how fun this place is). First floor is a bar, eating area and a separate DJ. Down in the basement is where the dance floor lies. This place was closed down for a little over a year, and thankfully they improved the ventilation down there, added a few couches to lounge and yes another bar area. Can get tiresome waiting for a drink when it gets crowded though   Music: DJ changes every week and there is a different DJ upstairs and downstairs. My favorite night is the last Saturday of every month called \"I got 5 on it\", DJ'd by Cleveland's own Terry Urban (now lives in NY and comes to CLE to spin). This night is 90s hip hop and guaranteed a fun night. I love how there is no drama/unnecessary fights or obnoxious patrons/dancers here. Total dance bliss for me every single time I've been there.   Food: I've never dined at this establishment, but hey that's something to do if you're trying to avoid paying cover. I have indulged in the Touch's food truck tacos which frequents W 25 street at night...an excellent night cap to replace the proteins and carbs after a night of doing the running man."}
