{"text":"There's a lot of heart here! This cafe is owned by a lovely couple that will do everything they can to make your stay- or take out- the best they can be.   I came here for a quick coffee meeting and we were immediately taken by the big all-day breakfast plate on offer. We completely forget our next activity was a full lunch and ordered three plates. So cheap, filling and good. Bacon, eggs, potato, toast. The perfect greasy breaky. Not fancy, but extremely well-priced and as you should expect. When you ask for hot sauce, they will come running with it! Anything to make your stay amazing.   Instead of going to Starbucks, please come here! Supporting local has never been so tasty and easy on the wallet. AND P.S. save yourself the trouble and don't walk around the building. Cafe Plus faces Dufferin in a large building. If you see Red Lobster, you've got too far North."}
{"text":"This cafe offers breakfast, lunch, snack and lotto. Nothing fancy, but it's quick. Some breakfast items include English muffin, bagel, croissant, and breakfast sandwiches. I dropped in for a $2 medium iced coffee.  They also have regular coffee, tea, espresso, americano, latte, cappuccino, hot chocolate and smoothies. The people working here were nice and friendly. There's ample parking spots in the lot and indoor and outdoor seating.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"What to say about this hidden sandwich shop in the red lobster building. It's pretty much that, serves sandwiches and wraps as well as some of the other necessities that could be found in a convenience store.  Unfortunately, the wrap I had was nothing more than a meh. The turkey was tasteless and the taste of the wrap had a strong pickle taste. Price point was reasonable and atmosphere was casual."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and cozy environment. Grabbed a hot Tea Latte(Spa Day) to keep me warm in this chilly day"}
