{"text":"Found this cafe on Yelp as I was traveling to Philly. Yummmmm is all I can say. I had the beef and portabella sandwich. It was delicious. It was served with onion rings and they were good too. My companions had the special, which was pulled pork sliders with candied bacon and chipolte sauce. They were served on pretzel buns. He really enjoyed them. They other friend had the fried cod sandwich and it was massive. The bread that the sandwiches was served on was fresh and perfectly grilled. My only complaint was that I almost fell face first into the restroom. There is a slight step up that is not marked and blends into the floor. A sign on the door that says step up would be helpful for out of towners. This is definitely a neighborhood place and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This is an update to my first review...as another post said they changed chefs and decreased their quality significantly.  The food has become bland, over priced, and the selection shrunk. We have crossed this off our local list...(sadly)"}
{"text":"Love the food. The ambience not so much.
Service slow but friendly,prices a tad high
No bread or salad with entree.Noise level

The night we were there was too loud for coonversation.  Also crab bisque was 
an epic fail and returned."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The service was great and the food was amazing! Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner when staying at the nearby holiday inn. Was recommended by the staff in the lobby. Recommendation turned out to be a good one, as the service was very gracious and friendly. Food was a little pricey, but worth it in my opinion. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this restaurant. It is not the largest or most modern place, but they consistently have great service and the food is delicious. I have had filet and Delmonico and both were prepared just right. We have a number of choices in the area, but we continue to go back to Fontanas."}
{"text":"I live right up the street from this place and I have to tell you, it's a happening place to be. It's a small building so if you're not into crowded spaces, I'd say avoid it for anytime but lunch, which wouldn't be as bad as dinner and bar time into the night.  I, on the other hand, don't really mind either way. Just be aware that if you don't have a reservation and they're full, there isn't really a waiting area besides standing outside or right up against the front door. 

My fiancé and I went here last weekend for dinner, he'd never been there before and I raved about my love of their Shirley temples. Though they had no tables (two reserved) the hostess friendly joked with us if we were planning to stay all night and smiled  We said we just wanted to eat, no bar and shenanigans. She said she's be back and left for a moment. She came back and stared at her table diagram for a few moments and said she could squeeze us in. She then seated us at a table for two and took off the reservation sign and wished us a good dinner. That was really nice of her, which was refreshing being people like that have become difficult to come by. 

The place is small so there's a lot of maneuvering around for the waitresses, but it doesn't really interfere with you. Though it was a bit noisy, we looked at our menus and chatted. The bar was full and had people standing behind the chairs being there weren't enough. It seems to be a lot of loyal locals. Anyways. Andrew ordered the Portabella as an appetizer ($8 or $9) and said it was delicious and totally worth the money. It didn't look half bad and I'm a very picky eater. For dinner he ordered the Plum Tomato and Basil Pasta ($14) and I ordered the 8-cut six inch extra cheese pizza (I mistook it for a six-cut) and a side of fries. The pizza was absolutely delicious, besides the thin and flimsy crust which made it difficult to eat without a fork and knife. Even with that I'd get it again indefinitely. Andrew's pasta was very good, but for the $14 we payed for it, we were unimpressed with the amount he got. 

Overall the staff is friendly and the food is pretty good, but a little overpriced depending on what you get. I'd recommend it to a friend and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Whether it's wing night or getting take out, the food never fails!! The service and employees are great as well!! Definitely need to try this place if you are ever in the area!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, service was great (cathy our server was just the sweetest)!!! Food came out in perfect time. Had the wedding soup and oe of their features a dorrito buff wrap both were amazing! Would reccommend!"}
{"text":"The Italian sub we very good however the bartenders were not friendly or attentive to our large group.  We will not go back based on how we were treated by the staff."}
{"text":"Irwin areas best restaurant and bar.  Family like atmosphere, friendly people, and entertainment...what else do you need?"}
{"text":"Real food, made from scratch. 

Friendly, helpful staff. 

A short walk from the Tesla Supercharger, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great place. Bartenders & wait staff are all friendly & welcoming. Always different craft beers on tap & always different dinner specials that are all terrific. Fri & Sat there is live entertainment & it is always a good time."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was definitely not expecting the high-quality food from a little bar like this. I've only been in to eat twice, but was very impressed both times.  You can tell that the staff is busy, but they are still very friendly and deliver quick service.  The only downside to this place is that it is so crowded.  We try to make dinner reservations if we are eating rather than just having a drink because there are very few tables available.  One time we figured we would try without having reservations, but when we opened up the door the place was absolutely packed and there was a line several people deep around the bar, so we left.  It does get a little loud in there as well, but it is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great little local place. Food is fantastic and the entire staff great. Good live entertainment on the weekends"}
{"text":"Good steak! Very nice service. Great place to have a meal with friends then belly up to the bar or get some beer to go."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner w/ the kids.  My daughter wanted the bacon blue cheese salad w/ salmon added. Would have been $15.00, but since she's 12 and would no way finish a full size salad, I said just share the pizza we were ordering. The waitress was really nice and said they can make a smaller size salad w/ salmon for $11.00, I said ok. This salad was pretty damn big still, and was excellent. She still couldn't finish it, so we shared. Pizza was excellent too, dough tasted really fresh!  We tried a bowl of the crab chowder, was good but way to salty.  Will definitely be back, staff was really nice. One of the best hidden restaurants around. 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Found this gem last night.  The food is very good at reasonable prices.  Don't let the looks of the outside or inside stop you from having a good dinner.
The band playing last night was also good but the crowded bar area did diminish a tad from a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"New Chef and menu we found what use to be one of our favorite places as poor to fair. The food was both overcooked and undercooked worse it was overpriced. Service was poor, no offer of dessert I returned my first entrée and the loud comments made by the owner from the bar were rude if he had something to say sure wish he would have done this to my face."}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem, you will not be disappointed. Menu is for everyone and service and food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I enjoy listening to live music.  I especially enjoy listening to live music during those cold,dreary winter nights when nothing else seems to be the cure.

I recently discovered that Fontana's not only serves up an array of decent food, and drinks, but they feature some fine musical talent on scheduled Friday nights. 
The combination of great sounds mixed with tasteful food, satisfying drinks, and a fun atmosphere certainly works for me when looking for a bonus evening with friends. 

  I grew up in the area, and remember dining here as far back as high school, so I often encounter friends I havent seen in awhile.  I really like the fact that you can carry on a decent conversation while enjoying  the musical guest.

The bar area gets exceptionally crowded and seating is limited  but there is an adjoining dining room that is within ear shot of the music.   

Lots of good options for food and fun.  The bartenders are a great addition to the evenings festivities.   Be sure to try their seasonal sangria to get the party started."}
{"text":"This a restaurant may not look like much on the outside, but their food makes up for it! My brother always buys their fish sandwich, and it tastes great and is huge! We love their wings, especially on wing nights! They have great deals and their wing options are great! The BBQ and seasoned wings are our favorite. Half off their restaurant is a bar area, and the other half is a dining area. Not much seating on either side though there is usually not a wait. The parking is never a problem with their giant parking lot. Also, the staff is always friendly with the customers! They offer great service with great food consistently!"}
{"text":"#1, excellent food.  Soup, hot and tasty. Fish sandwhich served hot, great portion. Great service, great menu.  I'm from San Francisco where restaurants have to be great to survive, but this place serves better food than most. Definitely coming back next time in town.  Oh yeah, great beer specials too."}
{"text":"Still enjoy coming here.  The prosciutto and goat cheese salad is still a favorite of mine, along with the wings, which are exceptional!   

Also, a new favorite is their pepperoni pizza.  Definitely one of the best in the area.  The bar remains a favorite as well with plentiful TVs and a diverse socio-economic crowd.  This place is one of the best options for dinner in Irwin/North Huntingdon."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. They have some great sandwiches and entrees. My husband loves when they have the red snapper. My favorite go-to is the crab cake sandwich with a side salad and balsamic dressing. Also have great fish sandwiches...perfect for Lent.

Pros: Food is delicious, never had a bad meal. Staff is friendly, never any issues. Great little place!

Cons: If you've never been to Fontana's or are not from the area, you may not be expecting the higher prices. Fontana's is a bar, yes. But the food is not typical bar food and is can get a little pricey. Also, there is a typical bar area on one side and more of a small dining room on the other. If you want to be sure to get a table at dinnertime, it's best to make a reservation."}
{"text":"so somebody from Yelp please explain to me why this review is not listed? i've been eating here off and on for about eleven years plus. Somehow i've never had the displeasure of meeting the owner until my last two visits. I think its time to retire buddy! The food over the years has gone up and down but has always been slightly overpriced . With the limited amount of options in the area we always gave it another chance for the sake of variety. That is officially over! Here is a tip from a guy that manages a multi million dollar business ... If somebody asks to pay you for something extra on their meal do it with a smile and charge them! I believe it is his son that usually runs the bar and has always been very nice so its a shame that somebody let this old hobbit out front to talk to customers!Read less"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with the food here. Very good food but the place is too small. Not enough seating for how popular they are.  But the main complaint comes from dinner tonight. We ordered the crab and spinach dip which came out and looked soupy. Had a weird smell and as soon as we tried it, had to spit it out immediately. The crab smelled rotten and they took it back. The manager or guy up front who sat us came out and said the chef tried it and thought it was fine and maybe we just weren't used to it, but our server came back and said they tried it in the back and something wasn't right with it. So.... maybe the manager or whoever the guy is up front should get better training on handling customers and their dislikes instead of trying to blame the bad crab on our tastes.  I don't like to give bad reviews but the way the manager blamed us for the bad crab is why I'm giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of Irwin's best kept secrets due to the outside appearance. I always make it a point to stop when I'm in the area. The calamari and Fontana's peppers are my favorite appetizers. The prosciutto goat cheese salad and any of their sandwiches are my favorite dinners. Great place to catch up with a friend over dinner or drinks at the bar. Karaoke Wednesdays are hit or miss but can be a blast. Local bands on the weekend can be fun as well! All in all great for a family, date, or night out with always changing microbrew beers on draft. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good food with fair prices. You can't go wrong. They have everything from burgers to fish sandwiches to steaks and pasta."}
