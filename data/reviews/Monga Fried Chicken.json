{"text":"really juicy fried chicken, but tasted a bit sweet which is not my type. wings are really nice, crispy outside. spicy ones are not spicy to me. 
good to have variety in Toronto, should try it if u like fried chicken"}
{"text":"Chicken is average. This is a chain restaurant from Taiwan. I've had this in Taiwan and it is much better than here in Toronto. Something is amiss!
The coleslaw is terrible. 
Sweet potato fries were limp and soggy.
Way too expensive for below average food."}
{"text":"This seems to be the second place after Hot Star Fried Chicken offering Taiwanese style fried chicken (basically a piece of deep fried chicken breast in a bag). Not worth the price of $10 per piece. The chicken is fried with a coating and while the inside meat was juicy, the coating was not crispy at all. For roughly the same price, go to Hot Star further south at Yonge and Gerrard if you prefer crunch on your fried chicken. We ordered a combo for $14 which comes with one piece of chicken, fries, and Asian coleslaw (whatever that is, they put some other sauce on it instead of the usual vinaigrette). None of it was memorable. 

There was a line-up and a wait because this place just opened. It will probably dwindle once word gets out that it's only \"meh\".

The seating atmosphere is better than Hot Star's fast-food joint feel. The decor is comprised of exposed light bulbs, dark metal accents, and polished wood for a warm industrial feel. It looks good for photos and low pressure \"fun\" dates wherein you don't really feel like splurging on a fancy sitdown meal but don't want to look too cheap. It will allow an eat-and-run situation if the date is taking a nosedive for the worst and you have to bail quickly because you order and pay before you sit down.

The other thing they do better than Hot Star is their drinks menu in the form of fresh juices with flavours such as Kiwi Yogurt, Fresh Watermelon, Coconut x Orange, and Milky Papaya. Beware that the Milky Papaya drink is made with heavy cream rather than milk.

Overall, this is better packaging, but lesser crunch compared to Hot Star."}
{"text":"Monga is another addition to the collection Taiwanese fried chicken places popping up on Yonge street.  They serve Taiwanese fried chicken (shocker!) and an assortment of baos. The chicken you can get as a single piece for $10 + tax or as a combo with a small helping of fries and coleslaw for $14 + tax. The decor was nice and clean and the food came out quick, though it's important to note the place empty when I ordered. 

I ordered a single piece with their Okinawa Seaweed seasoning, which was a very sweet and overpowering of any other flavours.  I recommend trying salt and pepper seasoning if the taste of seaweed isn't your to your liking. 

The chicken was very juicy and crispy, however the portion of actual meat you get with the cut they use is small.  A lot of the piece was cartilage and bone and for $10 I would have liked to walk a way with a lot less on my plate. 

Ordered: Single piece of chicken with Okinawa Seaweed seasoning
Price: $10 + tax
Final thought: The chicken is good but doesn't stand above the other options in the area. The price and amount of meat you get makes this place a hard sell for me to go back."}
{"text":"I went to visit this place at dinner time on a week day. It was not too busy. They specialized in large fried chickens. They have fried chicken combos for $12-$13. I ordered the spicy chicken and it was cooked fairly quickly. I did enjoy it. The chicken was juicy and rather large. It did taste like white meat but it had a bone at the end. This place is good, but i still like other fried chicken places better. 

I think it's a bit expensive for $10 for a chicken. They have 2 other flavours too. If I recall correctly they heave a seaweed flavour and an original. I probably will go back to try the seaweed one!"}
{"text":"I seem to be very addicted to Taiwanese-style fried chicken.  This one is dusted with seaweed was very crispy and savoury. Very filling and tasty! Definitely hit the spot"}
{"text":"Taiwanese fast food has made it to Toronto. The fried chicken is made to order but greasier than I expected but still worth a try. Breading is light and portions are generous for the price, (the resulting piece is as long as my face) and I'm happy with the sesame vinegar Asian slaw. The okinawa seaweed reminded me of the seasoned McDonald's \"shake shake\" fries in Hong Kong. If you didn't arrive starving I suppose you could eat a combo in two meals. Still have yet to try the wings...
I'm not sure how I feel about gnawing on one huge boneless fried chicken steak, seems like too much of one texture and I'm still more of a wing person. The spicy chicken was more in line with cajun and dry spice, but not memorable. Somehow I just think the portion doesn't make up for what could be variation in textures and flavour..."}
{"text":"I don't even like fried chicken but I like their fried chicken. I had the seaweed flavoured one. I think it's pretty unique... haven't seen that elsewhere. I find the seaweed makes the chicken taste less greasy too. 

The fries are surprisingly very very delicious. My friend and I decided that we'd be back here just for the fries one day.

Coleslaw not so good. Will not order next time."}
{"text":"Best dinning environment of Fried Chicken in Toronto, really love the decor here. We ordered the Seaweed and Spicy ones, fresh and juicy, tasted delicious! Staff was nice too, will definitely come back the next try."}
{"text":"The seaweed topping was interesting. It was ~$12 for a chicken cutlet (no sides). Half of the cutlet was all bones and way thinner than the other half of it. 

There are like 4 taiwan fried chicken places in this vicinity. I think there's 2 hot star locations, 1 new place that hasn't opened yet (I can't remember the name), and this place."}
{"text":"I really liked it! Went in for takeout and the place was packed - waited about 15 minutes for my food.

All I got was the hot chick - chicken could have been spicier but it had a nice flavour to it - was juicy and crispy. 

will be back!"}
{"text":"I really love Taiwanese fried chicken.  I also really love baos.  It's too bad I didn't fall in love with Monga. It's not horrible, but it's just not a destination restaurant.  I didn't expect chicken chunks in my bao, I hoped it would be one solid piece. The bao stuck to the paper which is always a turn off.  

I will give this place the benefit of the doubt and give 3 stars considering I only tried the bao and not the large fried chicken. The service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Place is decent but everything tastes the same.   Not a big fan of the coating. It fell off while I was eating. I prefer chicken with crispy skin."}
{"text":"This place is good for a late-night snack. I prefer Mongas' over Popeyes or KFC just because the spices are a lot tastier. 
The chicken steaks are pretty big, and although they make it out of white meat, (maybe chicken breast) it's actually juicy and not dry.
The fries are the best! They're the perfect amount of thickness and crispiness. Coleslaw is a little small, and the baogers are okay- just because the meat/vegetable/bun ratio isn't even and I end up having bites of just the bun pretty often. 
I wish this place offered some selections for sauces."}
{"text":"Bought a box of wings with fries and a side classic baoger. 

Is just a regular deep fried wings with fries. Nothing special at all. But the wings they made is like not good at all even for a regular deep fry wings. Can do better at home using Tfal deep fryer. 

The bao was ok but the water from the cucumber makes the bao become smushed and soft. The meat was also normal. 

Overall, I would give it another chance next time since is still new but will try different stuff from the menu."}
{"text":"Another taiwanese fried chicken place downtown, just a block away from Hot Star.
Prices and presentation are similar, but Monga offers some different types of items like Bao's.

Lines get long, and as a result, the wait-time for your order also gets long.
There were about 15 orders ahead of us and ended up waiting 25 minutes before our order was ready.

If you get it to go, they'll give you a cute box. Otherwise, you'll just get a plate. Or perhaps everyone gets a box, but I think it would make more sense for it to be strictly a take-out box.

Ordered the The King, which comes with salt and pepper.
The chicken is thick. The breading is thin and crispy. It can get a bit dry because of how thick it is. I feel that if they just smashed it a bit thinner it might be better in this case like how Hot Star does it? Hot Star's chicken is quite thin compared to this place. I feel like I'm getting more chicken here as a result, but that's only because each bite comes with more chicken.

Not bad. $10 gets you a piece of chicken from both places. However, fried chicken is fried chicken, and they're competing with korean fried chicken and places like popeyes or KFC (also, all along the same general area), which makes it difficult because you're probably getting more chicken from its competitors for what you're paying for."}
{"text":"I took advantage of the Ritual eats week and finally tried the signature chicken combo from here. The combo comes with Asian coleslaw and crispy fries.

The fried chicken was so good it reminded me of home (Taiwan), it was juicy and flavorful. The fries were unexpectedly good. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The Monga Nuggets had a dusting of spicy powder.  The Nuggets tasted okay to me; it wasn't too seasoned but the pieces were indeed big and boneless.

I was extremely impressed with the Classic Baoger!  The Braised Pork Belly Baoger had pickled cabbage, fresh cucumber, and topped with cilantro and crushed peanuts (although you can ask for it to be without the toppings).  I was impressed with this because although we ate this while it was already cold, the bao bun was still very soft and squishy -- which is very rare for baos.  Usually when baos are cold, they become tasteless and hard.  (It must be because they import the buns from Taiwan!)  The braised pork belly was very fatty and delicious.  I commend their Baoger for sure!

The Milky Papaya is a take on the classic Taiwanese milk papaya.  I thought that it was very good in terms of the quantity of papaya that was in the drink.  You could really taste the papaya with each sip.  It wasn't very sweet, however, which is a good thing for some and a lacking part for others.

The King Signature Fried Chicken had a dusting of black pepper and salt.  Since it was also topped with honey, I could taste the sweetness of it.  However, I could barely taste the black pepper or salt part of it.  In essence, it was a big thick-cut piece of fried chicken that was fairly bland.  It wasn't too crispy either as there wasn't too much batter on it.  When you got to the middle part of the chicken, it could be quite dry as well.  There was no juice or fattiness in it.

The Taiker Signature Fried Chicken that had Okinawa seaweed on it tasted the same in terms of its insides as The King.  There wasn't enough Okinawa seaweed dusted on it to taste much different in my opinion.

Since the portion of the chicken was so large, I definitely wasn't able to finish the cutlet in one sitting.  I brought the rest home in a cute little box to enjoy the next day."}
{"text":"Choose your own adventure! I ordered two orders of nuggets to bring home, spicy and regular. Brought them home and to our surprise all the nuggets were packaged in the same box. 

The nuggets should have been separated into each of its own container. 

That's why the two points.

Lack of common sense."}
{"text":"Love their fries! We had the King and the classic baoger. Both taste great! The inside looks nice and clean, and service was pretty fast."}
{"text":"Stumble across this place and was pleasantly surprised at how good the wings were. They cook them fresh and not sitting under a heat lamp. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Of the taiwanese fried chickens I've had, this was the better one in terms of seasoning."}
{"text":"It seems like there's been a plethora of Taiwanese fried chicken shops that have opened up within a few blocks of each other. Apart from the egregiously large chicken cutlets, they've also got baos and other fried snacks that serve as a great alternative to committing to eating a huge piece of fried chicken. 

I got the fried chicken bao, which had a tender piece of fried chicken topped with pickled radish and garnishes which complemented the chicken and soft bun really well. 

The restaurant has a good amount of seating but you could easily take it to go. Bring your friends so you can try more items!"}
{"text":"I tried the \"Hot Chick\" fried chicken and was pretty underwhelmed.  The actual chicken portion and cook was spot-on.  It's a nice, moist, hearty helping of white meat (def nothing comparable to KFC/Popeyes, if that's what you're seeking).  The decor/atmosphere is pretty great as well, as was the service.  But the seasoning (at least the \"Hot Chick\" one) was semi-offputting.  It's not spicy, but kind of a semi-sweet BBQ rub that is fairly overpowering and just not tasty.. at least not in my opinion.  Next time I will try the signature Seaweed rub.  2.5/5"}
{"text":"Spontaneously walked in while looking for a quick meal downtown last night. Was instantly drawn in by the aspect of trying Asian style fried chicken in an inviting, down to earth setting. I tried the signature King combo, and was quite satisfied. The portion of fried chicken was more than generous, and made the price point a bit more realistic. The coating on the chicken was crispy and had a decent flavour overall. The fries that accompanied the meal seemed to have a similar breading as the meat, so needless to say, they were also crispy and had a similar taste. But because I'm not incredibly picky when it comes to chicken and fries, I enjoyed myself overall and left with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try it, but felt disappointed. Luckily, the chicken wasn't dry at all. However, I found most of the food generally bland. In terms of taste, I prefer Hot Star Chicken, but in terms of service and atmosphere Monga is a lot better."}
{"text":"This was a post Game of Thrones episode meal.  

The three of us decided to get the trio combo which was 3 pieces of their fried chicken, fries, and coleslaw for ~$33.

We ordered 2 anaheim pepper and 1 seaweed flavour of the fried chicken.  I really enjoyed the anahiem pepper flavour.  It had a little bit of heat and worked well with the crunchy skin of the chicken.

The chicken was moist on the inside and you could cut it really easily with a knife and fork.

We had a good time chowing down whilst talking about what happened on the most recent episode of GoT.

I only wish that they provided a little more coleslaw (they provided one of the single serving containers) and more fries to accompany the meal.

Another addition to the burgeoning asian fried chicken scene in Toronto.  It's always great to have more competition for good eats in the city."}
{"text":"Really great place for fried chicken. Chicken is fresh and nicely seasoned. Thin and evenly layered on the fried batter. Doesn't have that slightly heavy oily aftertaste that some fried chicken have. Wings are half-priced on Wed with the purchase of a drink (~$14). Had the milky papaya and it was reasonably smooth and sweet with a coconuty undertone. Nice contrast to the fried chicken. Staff was friendly too and the place felt pretty chill.

Overall, just a really great place for some honest fried chicken!"}
{"text":"The chicken is juicy, crispy and delicious. I got the spicy one and it was a good balance of flavour and heat without burning your tastebuds off. From a value perspective it's a little pricey but it's something different and a higher quality bird than what you'd probably get at KFC.

The fries were outstanding. I don't even really like fries, but these were intensely crispy and super flavourful. 

My one major problem was the portion size of ketchup that game with the fries - I wish I took a picture, it was almost insulting. Like picture one of the little tiny packets of ketchup squeezed into a dip cup. The tiny dip cup was barely 1/4 full of ketchup. I burned through it in about 3 fries. They need to leave a bottle out on the tables for people to portion themselves. 

Also, they should include a drink with the combo.

Overall, decent chicken and fries experience marred ever-so-slightly by a long wait time, lack of ketchup and higher prices than I expected."}
{"text":"?????????????? ????15????????????????????????????????????Toronto?????????????????????!???lucky me? ?????????????? ????Toronto??????? ????????????? ??????"}
{"text":"They had a opening promotion where if you ordered their chicken or wings, you get a cup of watermelon juice worth $5.75. Decided to give it a try. Ordered the seaweed flavored chicken. Came in a nice box ... how chicken tasted bland. No flavor at all. Watermelon juice was okay. Decor good, but don't think I will be coming back here for their chicken."}
{"text":"This is some fine FINGER LICKING GOOD fried chicken.
I visited their booth at Night It Up and I'm absolutely thrilled by the fact they're going to open their restaurant soon near Yonge and Bloor.

Service: 5/5
They know well about their products and was very accommodating.

Taste/food quality: 5/5
Juicy and fresh fried chicken. I loved it's chick cut and that's different than all of the other Taiwanese fried chicken out there. The first bite was mind-blowing, so tender and flavorful. Original pepper salt, spicy, and seaweed flavors were the 3 flavors they offer. I personally loved their spicy flavor, and I always ask for extra spicy, absolutely savory. 

I'll bring my friends to their soft opening at the end of this July."}
{"text":"Not sure how the service was! My friend bought some fried chicken for me. However, she did tell me that when she got her order which were the chicken nuggets, they just gave her the small bag of chicken, for which she asked for a bigger bag and instead they gave her a box! It was a nice looking box, and maybe that's all they had so still not sure.

She asked for spicy nuggets which is a powder that they shake in, and then shake the bag to spread the spices. The spices weren't completely even because the first nugget on top was not spicy at all, but the ones on the bottom were a *bit* spicier. This isn't your breaded kind of chicken. 100% meat, skin, fat, and a bit of cartilage. I expected it to be crispier, but only parts of the skin were crispy. I personally enjoy a light batter for extra crunch on my popcorn chicken, but I was alright with the amount of meat I ate.

Also I thought this was a bit expensive, a little over $10 as I can get full meals elsewhere for that price and this was only considered a snack, but I understand they gotta pay that Yonge St rent. 

Not to say I didn't enjoy it, but overall, average chicken for downtown."}
{"text":"Monga fried chicken opened up shop near my office. Located at yonge street south of Charles, it's prime location. They serve fried chicken and bao.

They have a large dining area with lots of seats. The service was good. I got the king chicken combo - chicken with salt and pepper. The combo comes with fries and coleslaw. Really anticipated to try this place. However, I was very disappointed, the chicken was really dry probably because it was white meat? and there was not much flavour to it. For around $15 I was expecting more."}
{"text":"That was 1lb of chicken wings? Nooooo! Someone tell me I didn't just devour 1lb of chicken wings! Then once I accepted that I did, I convinced myself that somewhere in this world, there's probably such a thing as a \"1lb of chicken wings diet\" and I was participating in such a thing. OK, so it's not that much, but something about seeing the number \"1lb\" makes it seem less sensible than if they had just said 8-10 wings. I mean, if I gain 1lb at the end of the day, I know exactly where it came from. I'm not going to gain 10 wings...I hope.

But enough of the rambling. Here's the short of it: I really like the wings here. It's a little pricy. $12 for just the wings, $16 if you add the fries and cole slaw. The fries and cole slaw are OK, but the wings (Crispy Mexico) make it a winner for me. I actually find that I like it more than their \"signature\" fried chicken. The wings are juicy, crispy and tender...I could eat another lb to be honest.

They have fresh juice. I love watermelon juice, so that's the only one I can speak to (because that's the only one that I've tried). But it's very good, albeit it's $5.75. I think worth the price, though."}
{"text":"The good: new Chinese fried chicken place?

The bad: where should I start. Came in on a Saturday lunch hour, place wasn't busy. However, the time it took to order to the time of receiving the order took almost 30 minutes! Hate being picky with time, but....

The ugly: the combo order was just one piece of chicken, with some ordinary fries, and some even ordinary salad... for $15. Up to you if it's pricey or not, but imo it was overpriced for what you get (FYI, one piece of chicken without combo is $10). So price, preparation time of food isn't great, but how's the taste? It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, it tasted exactly what it looks like. 

On a positive note, it had great decor and a cool Asian flare to the restaurant. Staff was nice and not rude. Cheers :)"}
{"text":"Situated not far away from Hot Star, this place serves fried chicken and bao's.  Unfortunately, their fried chicken was just not as good as Hot Star's.  The crispy batter/skin was just lacking and really, that dictates the chicken's taste.  The bao's were just okay - their pork belly one was a bit of a rip off with a small amount of pork belly.  Their fried chicken one was more decent.  Overall, I would rather go to Hot Star!"}
{"text":"This is the first and only Taiwanese fried chicken place like this that I have tried, so I don't really have anything to compare it with.  The chicken itself was very large, moist, and crispy.  The flavor of the chicken was very unique, seasoned Asian spices.  Although it was prepared very well, I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this type of chicken."}
{"text":"Was not a fan. Didn't like the chicken at all. The portion size was pretty good but don't go here and expect normal, north american style fried chicken. It is a completely different batter and taste, i guess Taiwanese style. I knew it would be different but not that different, in any case, if you like Taiwanese style friend chicken then you'd probably like it but if not you definitely won't"}
{"text":"The chicken is very big and fresh. Probably one of the best chicken in downtown. It's good as expected but nothing special. The chicken itself is $10 plus tax. You can turn your meal into a combo, which they will add some fries and some coleslaw to your meal. But in my opinion It would be a lot better if they include a drink in a combo. Almost all the food they sell are deep fried, so not buying a drink is not a wise idea. You can buy drink separately but then you will have to pay the drink in full price. The combo itself is already expensive, so paying extra $ for a drink is going to add up even more. The service however is very nice and helpful.  Also the Decor is great and the place is not too busy and noisy. I do decide to bring my friends to check it out next time but unfortunately I won't go back there by myself. It's a good place don't get me wrong but for a $14 combo plus tax and also adding those expensive drinks is just way too much."}
{"text":"The food is maybe 3 stars at best, but its so terribly overpriced that i put it at 2. But its very clean and new and i appreciate that. I guess thats where the extra money goes to. Because it doesnt go to flavouring.

I ordered the seaweed fried chicken because TFC doesnt have it. I should have ordered hot chick. The seaweed flavour was too light. And their chicken was too thick. It was just lots of white chicken meat. 

At $17.39 for the combo with fries, it didnt even include a drink. 

2 stars out of 5.

Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:
[*] Disappointing. Just...no. 
[**] Not very good. Will not return. 
[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. 
[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. 
[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Pretty okay I guess. Chicken is a bit fry. I think I just prefer my chicken a little juicer.  Plus, this stuff isn't cheap so for that price, I'm kinda disappointed that half the chicken is really just bone."}
{"text":"There is a distinct difference of the deep fried chicken between hot star and monga. The one at hot star is pounded flat and had a crispier breading; whereas the one at monga is thicker so obviously it isn't as juicy as Hot Star. Also the breading wasn't crispy, but still good! 

I got the seaweed one and to be honest I thought the chicken wasn't bad, but once you get to the center, the chicken is quite dry due to a thicker cut so you will definitely need a dipping sauce. My friend ended up using his left-over Popeyes dipping sauce cuz the chicken was too dry for his liking lol. I also thought the chicken is quite flavorless... the seaweed on top was strangely sweet and overwhelmed the chicken. 

I also tried their baos, which are WAYYYY better than the deep fried chickens imo. I recommend getting their shrimp one."}
{"text":"super good! juicy, huge fried chicken! Taiker's seaweed flavor was a nice added touch"}
{"text":"Monga is conveniently located on Yonge north of Wellesley. Menu is mostly fried chicken or pork. I had a small but tasty bao chicken bun with cole slaw and a delicious watermelon juice. The deep fried chicken looked good too. Limited seating but it seemed like most orders were take out. Price is a bit high for the amount of food but I enjoyed what I had."}
{"text":"Good little Taiwanese fried chicken place at Yonge & Isabella. The fried chicken here is marinated in honey for 8 hours, and the chicken comes out very tender and juicy. I have been told this place is better than Hot Star, but I haven't personally tried HS so I can't comment.

I ordered the Okinawa seaweed fried chicken, and the first few bites are heavenly. The taste of the seasoning does get tiring afterwards, so I would recommend the original flavor with salt and pepper instead.

What I especially liked here though is the Baogers - steamed buns. Although there are better pork belly baos out there, this is the first place that I came across that has baos with fried chicken.

Overall, this place is A-OK."}
{"text":"I used to be addicted to this place but it wears off quickly. It's probably 50% more expensive then it needs to be (it's ridiculously expensive). The chicken is great but a lot of the time you get a piece that's 25% bone. There's not many varieties of flavour and the fries are pretty mediocre (it helps if you ask them to add some spice to them)."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bao burgers are great. Especially the fried chicken one. The fries are super crispy and seasoned perfectly. The interior is hip and clean!"}
{"text":"A friend and I got one chicken baoger each and we shared some chicken nuggets. The chicken nuggets were rather dry and not very flavourful. The chicken baogers were presented nicely, more flavourful than the nuggets, but the bun was bland. 
The service was inattentive but generally friendly."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Taiker signature fried chicken here. The seaweed added a great strong taste to the crispy shell and the meat was very very juicy. For $12 its comparable to the competition. The giant chicken is also bone-in. Also tried the fried chicken bao and it was also very crisp and juicy. Really enjoyed both items and I would return."}
{"text":"I had the fried chicken in \"Okinawa\" flavor where they added seaweed flakes on it. The time that I went was really busy so it took awhile for them to make. The chicken came piping hot, it was really good! They fry the chicken to order and so it's still crispy. Overall I really enjoyed it but for the price point, it's a bit high but is at a standard price for fried chicken places. Service was really good as well even though it was getting busy."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing lots of hype .. they have a cool selection of flavours but they don't taste super different. It's more like just the toppings are different. The chicken is okay, does not stand out. I would suggest some different sauces to accompany the chicken."}
{"text":"I came here on the soft opening day. Their chicken is very expensive - $15 for combo and $10 for just a piece of flat chicken (with bones). I ordered the seaweed flavoured chicken. To my surprise there was nothing special to the not-so-crispy chicken and coated with MSG. I prefer Hot Star when it comes to the right crispiness and flavour. Two stars for the nice decor."}
{"text":"Pricey and I've had better Taiwanese fried chicken. Ordered their chicken nuggets ($9-10) and the portions were tiny and more batter than chicken. A couple of pieces of chicken were undercooked so I had to throw it away."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place when it first opened but I don't work downtown so it's a mission to get there from Sauga lol. I came here on a Saturday afternoon with a few of my foodie friends to try this place out. I believe this place opens at 12pm on the weekends and we arrived around 1230pm. It wasn't busy - too early for fried chicken?  upon arrival you'd see the menu and it's pretty straight forward. If it's your first time, you should probably google their menu to prevent a line up clog since it's right by the door. 

What we ordered:
Nuggets spicy + black pepper $7
3 piece fried chicken combo $33: 
[2 king (original black pepper) & 1 taiker (seaweed seasoning)] + 1 plate of fries 
1 piece fried chicken combo $14 I think: spicy 
1 papaya smoothie $5
A few fresh watermelon juice $5 

Nuggets/popcorn chicken were good. Meat was juicy and tender. I liked the batter they used to fry it.. was crispy! There was about 7-8 pieces. 
King (original) steak is self explanatory. Lightly salted with a slight hint of black pepper taste. 
Spicy also self explanatory. Can taste more spice here but not that spicy it's unbearable. 
Taiker was good. Probably the best one out of the 3. Seaweed wasn't overwhelming and added a kick to the piece. 

In comparison, the chicken steaks are thicker than hot star. Chicken pieces are juicy and tender as well and they're huge. As big as yo face. 
The fries tasted good! Crispy like Costco fries and they're seasoned so there's more flavour to it. 
As for the drinks, papaya tasted really plain and healthy. I wouldn't get this again, we didn't enjoy this one. Watermelon is probably the best one because it's made fresh and it quenches your thirst from eating all the fried stuff. 

There are a few seats available. Hopefully it's not that busy.. If you're lucky! Can grab a booth seat near the light. 

Overall, this place is good but not THAT amazing. 4* because I liked the chicken nuggets and the watermelon juice. 3.5* for chicken steak."}
{"text":"Really slow service. Overpriced fried chicken that is not seasoned very well. Charges 50 cents for a cup of water. Bao is very flat with minimal fillings and a small piece of meat. Will not return."}
{"text":"It's more like a 3.5 stars for their giant chicken but I absolutely love their chicken nuggets! They're the perfect chicken to skin ratio that I love.

I feel like you have to like this type of chicken to really feel like you're getting your money's worth or else it's really lackluster. Because it is cooked well and not dry (at least the one I had), but I just personally find it tiresome after a few bites. I wish they would introduce some fun sauces to help elevate the flavours more. I had to ask for hot sauce cause I just got bored of the plain chicken taste.

But if you just like the taste of chicken, totally worth a try! Or if you don't, definitely get the nuggets."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Personally I found their fries way too SALTY, so salty that after finished half of the fries, my mouth felt dry and burning. As for the chicken, it was pretty JUICY and tender, so that's a plus. The shell was crispy but gets soggy pretty quickly so you may want to eat there instead of take out."}
{"text":"TLDR: it's a bit expensive, but you get more chicken than batter! 

I ordered the Monga Nuggets, which ended up being 5-6 pieces of huge chicken balls (size of 2 McDonalds chicken nuggets). It's a bit on the pricey side though $7.99, but you actually get a decent amount of chicken (compared to other chicken nugget places). However, because these nuggets were not covered in batter, the nuggets were not crunchy at all..."}
{"text":"Walked by this place many times since it's around work and have never been too interested in going in to try. The front of the store seems a little dark and mysterious but in a bad way. Coworker being Taiwan really wanted to go support the business so decided to go for lunch one day. Also, who can say no to a free meal courtesy of a loving coworker. A note of caution, the area right in front of the door is slanted and was quite slippery on a winter day. Almost fell before getting any fried chicken which would have been pretty unfortunate.

There were three flavours of fried chicken to choose from and they were made fresh to order. The fried chicken looked very appealing when it was served, got to admit was very tempted to take a huge bite but that would have been a burning mistake. The first bite was a bit disappointing, was expecting a strong seaweed flavour but got nothing. Thought maybe it was just too hot to taste or the edges just didn't get of the flavouring. But sadly, the flavour didn't get any stronger in the centre. The fried chicken was crispy but it was bland, wish it tasted more like seaweed.

Overall, will come back if the coworker decides to come back to try the bao. Personally enjoyed the fried chicken at the other stores more."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Tried this place with some friends the other night and left satisfied. I tried the Okinawa seaweed fried chicken and the Hot Chick fried chicken along with some Asian coleslaw. 

The chicken wasn't dry or too oily. I found that the Okinawa seaweed wasn't that flavorful and I couldn't taste the seaweed that much - there wasn't that much seaweed sprinkled on it. I also found that the batter kept coming off first with each of my bites. The Hot Chick was better - I enjoyed this one more but I thought it could've been more spicy. I was definitely expecting more flavour and more interesting choices in flavours from this place but despite this, I overall enjoyed the chicken and it satisfied my fried chicken cravings. The chicken is served in a paper sleeve and there are boxes if you order to-go. The coleslaw was standard - I don't know why it's called \"Asian\" coleslaw.. I personally didn't think it had any Asian flavours or spices.. It was also a little overpriced in my opinion. I'd come back."}
