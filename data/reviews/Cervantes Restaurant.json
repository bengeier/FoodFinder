{"text":"Went in on a Groupon, food was good but also greasy, but not enuff for me to go out of my way to eat there.  Went there at lunch, it was dead, but yet took forever to get our food."}
{"text":"I had my Wedding here last November 2015. I loved the venue, service and food. Cocktail hour was awesome too. The Guests loved it all. Chris and Grace made sure that everything was perfect. During preparations, they communicated and always offered help. They were just not my venue contacts but they treated us like family. You cant always say that about a venue but I can say this about Cervantes. Not to mention the price was a steal for all that we received. I have no complaints. Happy Bride/ Wife, Happy life. I was very impressed. The next time you plan your event, consider them because they deliver nothing but the best. Thanks Chris and Grace for making my Big day MEMORABLE AND SPECIAL."}
{"text":"The service here is awful! No silverware on the tables when we arrived. I had to ask the waitress 3 separate times for silverware. Even after she was holding the silverware in her hand looking confused AND I pointed at the 3 other people that needed silverware the lady just walked away. We were a party of 12, the restaurant knew ahead of time we were coming and customized a menu for our table with only 3 choices: 1)cheese enchiladas 2) chicken tacos 3) bean tostadas. Even then they couldn't get it right. We all ordered together and our food came out 2 at a time and over a span of 2 1/2 hours. Our food arrived cold, the cheese was hard, the chicken bland and beans were cold. The place was empty so they had no excuse. There were only 2 small tables there and they had already been served when they were taking our order. Needless to say this place was a great disappointment and not worth a second visit. If you're in the area you are better off going any other place for Mexican food than here. May I recommend, Filibertos? At least their food is cheap and usually hot!"}
{"text":"The service was really slow and the food was in really small portions. My wife and my son ordered a plate of nachos and a plate of nachos from 7 eleven has more cheese than theirs.The worst thing about the restaurant was the price. My wife told the lady that the nachos didn't have any cheese and she said that we had to pay for them because she had eaten a few chips! We are not picky about our food but, today we were really disappointed with the hole experience and will not recommended to anybody!"}
{"text":"This place sucks.  The amount of food on the plates is absolutely TINY and VERY expensive. Not to mention the actual quality of the food is mediocre at best. Got the enchilada combo plate and there was a thin layer of food that barely rose above the lip of the flat plate. It was like eating food in 2D since there was no depth of sustenance. I think my printer could print out a thicker layer of ink than the thickness of food on the plate. Honestly, Taco Bell destroys this place in quality and amount of food given. The food is very simple and could be made for a couple dollars at home. No value whatsoever.  Service was meh. Large party? Forget about it as they can't deal with it. I was continually bumped in my shoulder by the servers as they retrieved and placed dishes and glasses.  They have a live mariachi band on some nights which was pretty cool but they don't play at some stage in the middle of the restaurant, they walk around and play RIGHT by your table VERY loudly which is extremely annoying while trying to eat or even talk with your party.   Also, location? It's in a dive of a place with many rowdy bars nearby and just a single working light pole in a rather large parking lot. It's the kind of place you wonder if your car is going to get broken into."}
{"text":"This is Great Place' to hold a celebration dinner. They have Mariachi music on Friday's at 8pm, our celebration party was well entertained by the quality of Mariachi musicianship and that they sang every song request from our party guests. The food was very good along with the requested cocktails from the bar- no complaints here! Oh I forgot to mention the celebration dinner will also come with free event planning assistance, thanks Grace ' for the shock and Awe surprise birthday party planning ideas for my wife's 50th birthday it was a fun time thanks again-"}
{"text":"This place has the best food around. The people here are kind the service is quick and well the tacos are awesome especially the shredded beef ones. Oh the rice and beans are out if this world. I highly recommend. Oh and Friday nights are the best. There is free mariachis on Friday nights and the atmosphere is fun and more fun without the pressure of \"pick-up\" night at the other establishments. Oh, did I mention the food is great? And the people are fantastic, kudos to the cooks, the servers and the owner are all great--I highly recommend this place to anyone with a heart and a sense of fun."}
{"text":"The Mariachi band was great.....but the enchilada sauce was a disaster. The worst sauce we had ever tasted - bitter and bland. All the other dishes were edible, pretty decent. The service was slow due to the restaurant being under-staffed. We may have gone on a bad night.... It could be a nice Friday evening if you love mariachi music and don't order the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Cervantes has a free mariachi show on Friday nights from 8pm to closing (about 1am).  The Cervantes family has been a mariachi music tradition in the valley for decades.  Chris, his father, brother and niece are the core of the group with rotating pick-up musicians completing a compliment of, generally, five.  The food is good, reasonably priced and with a complete bar.  Available for private parties and even catering.  I love this place.  SW corner of Mill and Southern.  A wonderfully friendly staff and loyal customer base."}
{"text":"Not a great place. I do not mind old rundown places but you could smell the fresh urinal cake.  Went for lunch on a Wednesday and only two other people in there. Owner took order at register which was fine but he didn't seem to be into the whole thing,  older gentleman brought drinks and food.  I think he washed dishes too.  Tacos were greasy and food was so so at best. My boss ordered a carne asada chimi that was full of greasy, old, and fatty pork.  Just not a good experience.  I think they worry about the bar business at night.  The older gentleman was very kind and courteous though."}
{"text":"wow what a gem, went there today for lunch by my work. Chips and salsa where fresh and tasty!  The place was pretty empty (which I like, no screaming kids please!) but the staff was fast and nice and checked on me twice but were not hovering and asking a million questions.  I had the Carne Asada Burro and it was very tasty! The beans were delicious! And you could tell they were homade.  Overall it was very nice. If you are ever in the area try it out!"}
{"text":"Holy shit! Never have I been so pissed at a resteraunt. Service? Terrrrrrrible and non existent. Food? Is this the Oregon Trail set on meager? This place is the biggest ripoff since Milli Vanilli. You're forced into one check on a party over 5 people so they can screw you on their 18% gratituity... which they don't deserve because I mean... there is no service they should pay me money for being at this dump. Never have I been at a place so dead and still wait 25 minutes for a re fill and then get an attitude for having to go ask again for it. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this place like the plague. Also their Nachos? More like a side of chips with a pinch of cheese melted on them. Seriously you guys SUCK!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill in the past two years. When I went in in 2012, the food was acceptable, and there was table service for lunch.  This time, I ordered at the counter, the food was delivered to the table. I'm not good at cooking Mexican food but probably could have done better.  There's a funky smell in there, too. It didn't feel clean.  The man at the counter was nice, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Yuck! The chips were okay. Some of them were straight white. Im not sure if they're not cooked or what but they were chewy and not good. The salsa was alright too. Not bad. I ordered a beef tostada and a beef taco. I took one bite of the tostada and couldn't take another. So gross. The beans were nasty. Not the refried beans im used to. I could have bought a can of Rosarita and been better off. Also, Idk what it was but something on there was really mushy. Almost a fish consistency actually. I was grossed out. The taco was OKAY...but I had about two bites of that as well...I thought I was getting ground beef but it was shredded. I gave the plate back and they didn't charge me for it. I also tried the chicken in my boyfriends enchilada and that was disgusting as well. I wanted to spit it out but i just dealt with it. He didn't like anything on his plate but the chicken inside of the enchilada. Sauce was gross, etc. I'm not going to come back. Super friendly staff though!! Great service and if you like mariachi bands they're live every Friday night."}
{"text":"The place smells like a burning tire when you walk in. Service was ok, but the food wasn't very good. We were dissapointed with the entire experience. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Was disappointed had a party there for 100 ppls they served your choose of Green Chili or Chicken ,rice & beans. Not even 1 hour later they ran out of the chicken! And it turned out to be about 60 to about 70 ppls that came. The beans and rice were very bland. And they served very small portions.   The lady kept coming over and telling us it was to loud. First it was the music was to loud then it was that we were to loud! What a disappointment! They did have Mariachis that were really good and they even came to our side and sang Happy Birthday to the birthday girl and sang a few more songs. The overall I wouldn't do another party here.."}
{"text":"Came here for a party on a Friday. Everything seemed ok until the food was served I will not go into details but I can say they served tortillas raw. I felt like they came straight from Costco's freezer uncooked and all. The chips also nacho chips from Costco. Nothing against Costco because I love it but just saying. Then the music started playing and the kids started dancing the owner came in a told us the party was to loud. Keep in mind they only had a small speaker no DJ and maybe about 20 teens. This room was rented for that. We started to play a game of bingo and got told the person calling out the number was also to loud. At this point I'm floored and can't believe I'm witnessing this. Never have I ever experienced something like this. I could  understand if the party was out of control but this was not even close. I would not recommend this place nor will I ever go back. If I was the host I would contact my bank and ask for a full refund. Very very disappointed and feel sorry for the birthday girl and her family. Very unprofessional of the owner to complain the whole 4 hours."}
{"text":"Ive been eye balling this place for some time after seeing they offered a dining certificate on restaurant.com.. so the Mr and I wanting to eat on the cheap headed over there. Okay, to get into this place you have to turn into the plaza behind the restaurant on Southern.. if you park in the adjacent lot on Mill you might get towed so look out.   We did find the entrance and was greeted warmly by our server. Service here is great.. very attentive and willing to please. The food is decent enough, basic cheap Mexican fare.. taco's, burro's etc.. we shared a cheese crispy which was more like cheese limp but tasted great, like home made.. the chunky salsa they served had a nice bite and worked well with the 'limp'. Also had the red chile burro as an app.. no one can do red chile like La Canasta.. however the meat was plentiful and cooked very well.   The Mr had the Chicken enchilada's, very good, a nice creaminess to the sauce. I splurged and had a beef chimi.. was very good and not greasy at all.   So the food here is good but not one of those places where you feel the need to return to try more things. Please note they are only open for dinner on Friday nights otherwise this is a lunch place. Live Mariachis on Friday night as well!"}
{"text":"I'm not really one to complain but I have to say, this place was DISGUSTING!!!! I'm the least pickiest eater, I will eat anything and everything but I couldn't eat my entree which was enchiladas. The sauce was the worst thing I've ever eaten. This place makes Taco Bell look like a 5 star gourmet  restaurant. It's a nice comfy atmosphere and friendly staff the food is just horrible. The chips were even stale. A word of advice, if you want Mexican food this is not the place to get it"}
{"text":"After having been back multiple times the food isn't as good as it was initially; the rice doesn't seem fresh, the chips aren't good, the ground beef taco is alright but it is also simple. Other people in our party got other things which they didn't like. There are a lot of problems when ordering with a huge party and orders get mixed up. Service is slow and not everybody gets their food at the same time which leaves half our party eating and the other just waiting."}
{"text":"Decent choice for Mexican staples such as burritos, chimichangas, and enchiladas.  Service is fast, friendly, and attentive.  The salsa that came with the chips came in two varieties: mild and hot.  The mild wasn't chopped well enough, and there were whole stewed tomatoes in it, but it tasted OK.  I think the chef mistakenly thought that you had to add black pepper instead of whatever type of pepper they would normally use for the hot salsa, because it was littered with thick black bits of pepper, so much that when you smelled it, all you could smell was black pepper.    The food came out in very fast time.  I had the shrimp enchiladas, which were OK.  They weren't the best enchiladas I've had, but not the worst.  One shrimp still had some shell on it, and the shrimp itself was a little tough.  The green sauce was nice though, and it came with some big chunks of nice green chile.  The rice and beans that came with it were pretty good, very flavorful.  I tried some chicken chimichanga, which was a pretty big size.  The chicken was tender, and the tortilla it was wrapped in was nicely deep fried and came with a good amount of guacamole and sour cream.  We came here around 7 on a Friday night, and it wasn't busy at all.  They do have a mariachi band that comes in around 7:30-8 P.M. to perform, so there might have been more people coming in later!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere, family-owned. A Tempe gem."}
{"text":"Shame! This is Arizona, you can't get by with half-assed Mexican food. Lunch service was slow as hell and they got three orders wrong, no refills, food itself was lackluster. The only reason I gave them two stars is the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food.  Easy split checks.  Good for larger lunch groups."}
