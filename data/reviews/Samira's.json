{"text":"I can't say for sure but we have now waited 1 hour 40 minutes for 2 salads and a pizza ... but I doubt I will be returning.  For the prices you're charging,  hire more help."}
{"text":"Terrible! The staff was extremely rude! My friend and I went for some drinks and to enjoy the live music  We both ordered Martini's and were told they put extra in the shaker because their glasses were smaller than usual. I was about halfway through my martini  when another server came up to the table and said they were low on shakers and needed ours. I couldn't poor the rest in my glass since I only drank half and she continued to watch me poor asking me if I could hurry up and drink. I was so uncomfortable I told her to just take the shaker with half of my drink remaining in the shaker. Our server forgot our waters twice and never checked back on us. It was just an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Samira twice this summer, and loved it both times. The first time we went for our first anniversary dinner. We were seated with a great view of the river. I ordered the salmon, and my husband ordered the bone-in steak. Both had amazing flavor. Our server was attentive and friendly. The second time we went it was a last minute idea after work on a Friday. We both ordered the burger. It also had wonderful flavor. And again, our server was friendly and attentive. The great thing about the menu is it has something for everyone and every occassion, from delicious entrees, to burgers and pizza. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here. My Mother and split a veggie flat bread. Great for those of you looking for something light and healthy, not smothered in cheese. We split the scallops and they were wonderful! The service was also very good."}
{"text":"Tried Samira with my Diner's Club, and this was a middle of the road experience.   A Thursday night, although we had a reservation, the place was only 1/2 full.  Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable and professional.   I did notice that the other servers seemed to be less professional...walking through the dining room goofing off, and singing, etc. (it did distract from my table conversation).   The menu has a really nice variety or choices, and apparently the variety continues into the quality/taste of the dishes. Our group splilt the Arugula Flatbread app ($8) plenty of it and delicious!   The Mac and Cheese app (crowd favorite) and the homemade chips and dip.  While one from my group really enjoyed the chip dip, I did not, I was surprised by it being served cold and that sort of turned me off.   I had the crab bisque ($7), while flavor was good, texture was unusual, it was thick like a bisque but they had shredded crab meat, so tiny it looked like canned tunafish.  Not sure I'd order that again. Dinner we had the Chicken, moz, tomato pizza ($10),  burgers/fries and I had the ravioli ($18). Pizza was enjoyed, I thought it was just a bit mushy on the crust, the fries were fantastic, and both in my group enjoyed their burgers.  The Ravioli was Ohio City pasta and the flavor of it alone (no sauce) was delicious!   The sauce they paired it with had initially really interested me... a jalapeno broth- but thicker almost like a gravy.   I had each person taste it, not one of us enjoyed it.  I could not taste jalapeno, it was not at all spicy, but there was a unique/odd flavor and odor that killed the whole dish.   I scraped every ravioli  and left the sauce as well as the julienned veg that was swimming in it.   Dessert was nice, blueberry crisp cheesecake, peppermint brownie ice cream sandwich, and classic creme brulee.  While my creme brulee tasted very nice, it's texture was all wrong, runny and lumpy.  My bill for pop, soup, app, dinner and dessert was $43 (one person) Now the menu prices are what I have an issue with.  While Samira has a wonderful variety they also have range of prices that is out of line.   Pizza's and burgers $10-$15 pastas $18-22, then Chicken/ fish entrees $24-30, Steak in the $30's and one mixed grill dish for $44.  Competition is local favorite, Moe's and Piatta Novo in the Sheraton.  While I expect the higher prices for the hotel rest. I do not think Samira's prices are warranted.   The servers are in t-shirts, they don't clear plates/silverware, bring new silverware, not interrupt diners, have the polish service  to the caliber of $25-40 entree place.  My reccomendation, if you want to try it, skip the pricey entrees, pick your favorite apps/ burger and stick with that.   We will not likely visit again- for a while anyway."}
{"text":"This was pretty much the only place we found to eat on a Saturday night that wasn't a bar with a bunch of smokers outside.    Our server, Chris, was super friendly.   Delivered our drinks quickly.  Checked on us a few times but was not hovering.  Bar drinks are strong!  My vodka tonic was really strong and in a big glass; i.e. good value for your money!  The menu was nice, some things looked overpriced, but our total bill for two people was around $60 so not too bad.  I had the lobster ravioli.  It was delicious, and came with a decent amount of extra lobster meat in the sauce.  My only complaint was that the ravioli was a little dried out and on it's way to crunchy as pasta can do after it's cooked.  I guess they didn't want to drown it in sauce.  It was really good and the serving was the perfect size.  However, it looks exactly like lobster ravioli I've ordered in another restaurant in Iowa, so I wonder if it's probably frozen.  If in the area, I would eat here again.  The patio looked like a fun place to hang out and have drinks on a summer night."}
{"text":"Had a really nice dinner here.  The restaurant ambiance is great with a very nice building and location.  We ordered the Lobster Fritters for an appetizer.  They were delicious, with extra lobster meat on top.  I had the raspberry chocolate truffle martini, which was also very tasty and strong.  For our entrees, we ordered the seafood pasta and the duck salad.  The seafood pasta was fresh and full of scallops and veggies.  The duck salad was a little below what I was expecting, although it was tasty and fresh.  I had about five duck breast medallions and all of them had a fatty gristle piece that I couldn't chew.  Service was great and we had a nice time.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The decor is interesting, but seems as though they were hesitant to commit to the cool industrial appearance. My orgazmatini was delicious and my ravioli was just below my high expectations. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Beautiful interiors and views. I took my daughter there prior to a high-school function.    I ordered the Mac and cheese- it was bland and gross, to be honest.  My daughter ordered the salmon, which was delicous,  The portion was generous and well prepared.    I would love to host an intimate gathering here becuase of the views, environment, interiors, etc; however, I would want to have it catered by an outside company.    Maybe I am being too harsh & I imagine I will give it another try, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been to Samira twice in the last four days - once to give it a try & once to give it a second try after an iffy first experience.  There's nothing, like, WRONG with Samira. The menu is pretty extensive - lots of options - & the spicy onion rings are amaaaazing (they're even good cold!). The prices are decent - they range from $8 for sandiwches to $20+ for fancier entrees like lobster linguini & steak.   The first time I went, I ordered a thin-crust pizza with grilled chicken, sundried tomato pesto & smoked mozzarella. It was tasty but SO VERY GREASY. Like, I felt like I couldn't eat for another week after eating two slices of it. I took it home, but it was even greasier reheated. My second order was similar but in sandwich form - grilled chicken, sundried tomato pesto, fresh mozzarella & basil on crusty bread. It was less expensive, but equally greasy - I ended up having to eat it with a knife & fork instead of my hands, which was a bummer for a sandwich. That said, it was pretty good.  And did I mention the onion rings? Thin & crispy & just a liiiittle bit spicy, & they serve them in, like, a MOUNTAIN. Also greasy, but onion rings ought to be!  Overall, I'm not sure. I don't dislike Samira, but I don't love it, either. The atmosphere is nice, the place is well-decorated, & the server I had both times (same one) was very attentive & friendly. I'll probably be back, but maybe only when the Cashmere Cricket is closed..."}
{"text":"Good looking menu, but the service is ridiculous, the slowest, an hour and 45mins for lunch and all we ordered were sandwiches, mac n cheese,salad and soup.  Food was good, but who wants to sit for that long when you are hungry. Nobody is going to have a good experience or want to come back no matter how good the food is.  Definitely over priced lunch menu especially for the service and mediocre quality, compare to a Charleys without the franchise name. I eat out for lunch and dinner 5-6 times a week, i see a lot of restaurants, this shouldn't be one you target.  Sad thing is i work within a 2 minute walk from this place. Hopefully they read reviews and make adjustments to their pricing and service/management."}
{"text":"First off, I'm new to Yelp.  I joined so I could give great reviews to worthy restaurants, and I'm not making anything up in this review.  I grew up in Cuyahoga Falls, OH but am living on the West Coast.  I came back into town for the holidays, wanting to try what I thought was \"The River.\"  I found out it was rebranded into this restuarant and so I thought, why not give it a try.  I called in about 5:00pm on Dec. 29th, to take my folks in town and my GF to eat on me.  I talked to the consierge and was told that they couldn't seat me at 6:30, only at 6 or 7, giving me the impression that the restaurant was packed.  So when I arrived, to see half the restaurant empty, I was a bit confused.  I was seated in about 5 minutes at a booth for 4.         Once seated, 5 minutes later I had a waitress by the name of Arlene come and take our drinks.  Now mind you this is a highly stylized restaurant and has some spanish as well as modern American decoration and design, but really just a facial from \"The River.\"  So it was nice, but not very different.  However, being that the restaurant had a grand opening banner on it, I was interested in hearing about the restaurant.  But all I heard was, what would you like to drink?  Hmmmm....       The menu was very interesting, ranging from Trout, to Ravioli to Steaks to Bisque soup and Mexican Chocolate Creme Brulee.  It was a well put together menu, and had many things to come back and try.  Ranges for the food were from $5/6-25 or so.  Drinks were served promptly.  About 10 minutes later, we ordered our meals, and recieved bread about 5 minutes later.  Pretty good bread, with some olive oil and cushed pepper.         My step Dad went to use the restroom and afterwards came back laughing after witnessing a young couple storm out of the restaurant.  He remembered them saying that \"There'll be new owners in here soon,\" and was surprised at how steamed they were.         Everything was going well.  We had finished the bread and asked for more, but were told by one of the food preps/servers that they were out of bread.  The owner came by and reassured us about 10 minutes later that there was bread, just different type.  I probably raised an eyebrow to this, but certainly did right after when I saw three servers carrying an order out, followed by the master Chef who has plates HE was serving.  Now, mind you the owners decided to open two weeks before we visited.  I thought it was very rash to open any business before the New Year, but that's just me.  So I thought there were a few kinks to work out with any new business, but to have your master chef roll out the food was a bit odd. My experience as a server signaled to me this was a \"Help Wanted\", especially at such a high class place.         So we waited, and decided to try a bottle of wine after tasting a sample.  After about 10 more minutes, we had the bottle.  Mind you it's been about 30 minutes about before we see our two Bisque soups.  They come out hot, taste great!  The owner comes out and assures us that our food is almost ready, and Arlene comes out about 15 minutes after our soup and says it will be 5 minutes until she brings it out.  So in total, it take about 1.5 hours until we are served out entres.  My GF and I thought about walking out, but my folks didn't want to.           I ordered the Red Trout, GF ordered the Scallops, and we split the Ravioli.  My folks ordered the sirloin steak over pot roast, and the pizza - which has shrimp on a pita like bread among many more rustic, almost greek toppings.  One of my folks usually had a problem at many restaurants, but was pleasantly surprised and happy about his steak.  The pizza wasn't even hot, but she and the rest of the table still liked it.  BUT.... All three dishes we ordered were NOT hot, were tepidly warm, and we asked for the owner/manager.  Earlier, my GF had complained to the manager about the how were were given the impression that the place was packed on the phone, which was a lie.  She also mentioned that a place of this caliber shouldn't have a bread shortage.  He obliged and took our soups off \"Gratis\" of the bill.  We also had to argue with Arlene about how the food wasn't hot, even though she said it had just come off the grill.  Once the owner came at least 5 minutes later, he smuggly said that he had never been in a restaurant where 5 different complaints came from one table, and that he personally stood by the grill as the orders came off and made sure they went out pronto.  This was after Arlene told us it would be 5 minutes and it turned into 15.  We evern saw the owner walk from the opposite direction of the kitchen, so another lie.  We told him to take back the food and take our orders off, which he did.  Later, we saw the bill had the soups put back on, which he couldn't explain, even though I told him he did in spite of us complaining, to which he shrugged his shoulders.  We walked out so frustrated, never again.  PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!"}
