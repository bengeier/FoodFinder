{"text":"Joey's is me and my best friends favourite restaurant to come to for get togethers. 

Our favourites are the sushi cones as an app, lobster grilled cheese and lobster ravioli. Last week when we went though, we were really disappointed! They removed the lobster ravioli off the menu! The new pasta they had in its place, prawn florentine ravioli was not that great. Bring back the lobster ravioli!

Service at this location is always great - if you have to wait for dinner service, they bring out appetizers for you to snack on while you wait."}
{"text":"I think everyone has walked passed Joey before~ so I went here for lunch. Well, the environment is great, but the food is okay--not as good as I thought (already lost pics of the food and drinks we ordered)"}
{"text":"This place is so good I can't tell you. Me I just got my bill and there were hearts on it ;). The staff was fantastic. The food was phenomenal. The drinks delicious. My boyfriend as I came on here on a whim. We were heading somewhere else actually and when we got in here it's bee nothing but awesomeness from the start. I'm going to finish my sangria and head home for a good night sleep. Totally coming back for my bf's birthday. It's going to be wild."}
{"text":"Had the steak and sushi, and was not disappointed. Took a little bit to get our drinks, but overall enjoyed Joeys. Helpings aren't enormous, but the food did taste great."}
{"text":"Came in to the door, and didn't have to wait, the staff was very friendly and seating us promptly. I had the steak and it was delicious, very we'll Cooked. Didn't really care about the fries, I should is had something else. The bar area was impressive and made you feel like your at home. Anyways I will came back again."}
{"text":"Went with a couple of friends on a Sunday around noon. The restaurant was surprisingly quiet. 
We had really good & friendly service (although they changed our waitress 2 different times, apparently the other two were a bit hungover and got to leave early as it wasn't too busy). 

My friends ordered the dumplings as an appetizer, they were pretty good but nothing I would order again. 

We all had caesars (my favorite drink), I would have to say that it was one of the worst ceasars I have ever had, too watery. 

I had the Beach salad (quinoa, candied pecans, goat cheese, avocado, strawberries, chicken...), it was DELICIOUS! Very well served, I would definitely order that again."}
{"text":"This was our third time at Joey's and it was also the best experience out of all three, mainly bcos of our exceptionally friendly server (Kim). I'm not saying the two previous servers were bad but perhaps today was not as busy as usual so our server had more time to attend to our needs. 4 stars on the service. 

Onto the menu, so far I and my friend's favs are lobster and prawn ravioli (very deliciously creamy), Spanish paella (squeeze some lemon for even better taste), and chicken Alfredo. As for dessert, they use dark chocolate for the molten lava cake as well as some salt, which in my opinion made the dessert even better. I had also tried the grilled salmon as well as their steak in the previous visits, and in my opinion those weren't their best dishes. They weren't totally unpleasant but they could have done better.

With that said, we'll definitely return back to try more of their menus."}
{"text":"I like the service here very much, although a lot of the time its full.. food wise, their steak is quite nice, some appetizers (bar food such as sweet potato fries) are very tasty too. Their cocktail selection is fabulous, mojito is not the easiest thing to find in toronto. 

Their price is not the most attractive, but with the location, service, food, and the nice semi-outdoor bar lounge in the summer, i wont say its overpriced either. 

Recommend, and will come again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Easter Sunday because everything else was closed and food allergies take most restaurants off of my list. I had never been because I usually avoid chain restaurants but I knew that hey had a gluten free menu so we decided to give it a go. 

Their GF menu comes as a supplement to their regular menu, so you have to ask for it specifically. The gluten free menu is fairly limited in its selection but one major benefit is that they make sure that the food they are serving you is -actually- gluten free (I have celiac so it's actually a huge issue if it isn't). None of this \"we can't guarantee anything\" garbage. My waitress was also celiac so I knew she was taking it seriously and a manager came over to assure me that my everything was taken care of and my food would not make me die. 

I usually shy from so much attention at a restaurant, I really hate having to go through the whole explanation, or worse have to argue with the staff about what \"gluten free\" actually requires only to be disappointed. Everyone at Joey was incredibly kind and friendly and understanding. 

The atmosphere was a nice swap for my trajectory that evening which had been Chipotle and my boyfriend and I found ourselves on a lovely accidental date with atmospheric lighting and everything! 

I had the Seared Ahi Tuna salad which is one of my favourites and it was fantastic. I unusually disdain having to order salads but this was fantastic - bf had a burger which looked like the patty was homemade (read:made out of actual food). 

We agreed that we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food loved the salmon sushi and salmon bowl.  Fresh perfectly cooked. Great decor"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Toronto for a weekend, I saw great reviews on YELP and we decided to go our first night in town.  Well the reviews didn't lie this place was AWESOME! from the ambiance to the service to the food it had it all!.....we had an hour wait (which was well worth it) so we decided to go to the bar have some drinks and appetizers!  The bartender asked our name and where we were from and from there on addressed us by name every time and got our drinks without delay (all while the place was packed!) Highly recommend calamari as an appetizer was amazing!.....Once getting called to our table our waiter addressed us by name (shows the communication between bartenders and wait staff, that's amazing!)  My girlfriend and I enjoyed this place so much I went as far as finding the manager after our meal and commending her on her staff and food, which I have never done that before in my life!.......JOEY is a must if your in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after hearing so much buzz about it.  I'm giving this place 2 stars only for their decor and service.  This place is beautiful.  I sat on the covered patio on a beautiful sunny day in Toronto, so it was busy outside and allowed for a great vibe.  Joey's is pretty big and goes quite deep into the back so don't be fooled by the smaller-sized patio...this place holds a lot of people.

The dining room is roomy and you don't feel crammed.  However, its quite intimate and very, very nicely designed.

The menu?  Its ok.  Kinda pricey, especially for their 'lunch' items which are around $15-$20.  If you like to eat healthy, even when you eat out, I would recommend you check Joey's website.  They have a nutritional guide online.  

When you take a look at this guide, you will be shocked with the amount of calories, fat and sodium they have in their menu items.  Their 'Beach salad' which sounds quite healthy has over 600 calories, 45 grams of fat and 710mg of sodium!  The best selection I thought was the Steak Frites  and the side salad (cut out the fries).  You can ask them to go easy on the seasoning and cut the butter when preparing the steak.  

So basically, you end up paying a lot more for the food at Joey's, but its not of higher quality or nutritional value.

I think there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar fare menu but beautifully art decor new interior. Suited for the urban polished crowds flanking Eaton Center. 
Our hosts were a harem of gorgeous girls. The tuna salad and South LA chicken salad was reasonable but there's a good formula for success here. Will come back for reasonable good place to scope out eyecandy, decent food, cheap drinks (happy hr), and nice looking and central venue."}
{"text":"I've been to Joey Eaton Centre several times now and all I can say is that this place is totally awesome! I have always left this restaurant impressed by both the food and the service. The venue is very chic with high ceilings and walls covered in artwork with low lighting but not so low that you can't see. Their menus are very vast and everything on it is to rave about, I have yet to try a bad dish. Reccomend: lobster/cheese sandwhich & tuna burger. The food quality and quantity are superb with excess portion sizes compared to other chained restaurants. The service is very attentive, efficient... and... very appealing to the eyes. ;) Heh."}
{"text":"Like the rest of Canada, this place doesn't know how to prepare a mixed drink.  My Black Russian was the size of a drop of water.  What gives??  Two sips and its gone. Not my idea of a nice drink.  I ordered a small caesar starter salad.  Consisted of greens and two, exactly two croutons and about a brush stroke of dressing.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with 'stringy fries' (I think they were called?)  The manager comes out and says they made a mistake with it and it would be another five minutes. I said, no problem.  I also asked when I ordered for no tomatoes.  Well, it came with no tomatoes.  I brushed them off too, no biggie, but nothing here really impressed me, except the ladies."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a downtown location in Toronto to enjoy a great meal and drinks it would be Joey Eaton Centre. It's great for organizing large groups. When you get the bill it's broken down by individual orders. They also have charging stations for your smartphone/devices at the bar. Don't want to wait in line? They also have a Reservation App for the iphone so you don't have to wait in line or you can make advance reservations. My favourite part is that the staff there actually welcome you like family. The staff are approachable and friendly. Secret tips: They serve sake which is not on the menu. Order the baja tacos,mashed potatoe spring rolls and the steak and sushi roll dish too. My favourite is the ahi tuna burger. Special drink order, get the pickel back. It's a shot that you chase with pickle juice. Try them all."}
{"text":"If you squint, the front looks like a darker smaller version of the Crystal.  At least I think so in my head when the patio is open.  It does this high-tech Transformers thing where it kinda opens and closes which I think is pretty neat and made me want to go in and see what other cool toys took over the forever ago \"JJ Muggs\" space.

Inside its darkish, cool modern with lots of booth seating rather than standard tables an chairs.  Its not in the least claustrophobic (like Pickle Barrel down the street which is also very dark and has lots of booths everywhere) because its about neck height allowing you to see the entire space.  The bar area is large in gorgeous with equally pretty staffing.

The pricing of menu items are moderate to much, however of good quality if not very inspired.  The standout item had to be the creamy broccoli soup ($8) which was made in house and extremely tasty.  Everything else seemed a bit ordinary- not bad, just not outstanding.  Just a bit sad because there are so many great restaurants nearby with extraordinary food. 

The location is great, and the food tasty so its perfect if you are planning a work outing or something that requires you to find a space that is cool and entertain larger party numbers.  Also if its raining, but you still feel like sitting on a patio here's your choice.

However if you are looking for a standout meal to remember...maybe not your best choice."}
{"text":"5 stars for these 4 letters: J-O-E-Y. Okay, so that was lame, but I was seriously shocked to see that this place only has 3 -1/2 stars overall. Went to Joey's last night with a party of about 14 people (and we all know how miserable that can be) and I could not believe the incredible service we received. Two wonderful ladies served our table together and they were incredibly kind, organized, helpful, and attentive. And in addition to the excellent service, the food was on point, as well. I had the BBQ salmon on rice with vegetables and it was great. I also really envied the people who ordered the Mediterranean plate--that looked delicious! The \"Elderflower Collins\" was my drink of choice for the evening and I would highly recommend it. It's grapefruit flavor pretty much hides the taste of the alcohol altogether, so drink at your own risk! ;)"}
{"text":"Joey's website is very helpful when before going.(Locations,each Open hours,Menu,etc.)
TVs and Screens are set on every direction so I think don't worry miss watch at good game.  

Meals are Delicious.Seviers wear nice,looks cleanliness uniform and nice service.

Huge space where has second floor,too.Comfortable sofa chairs.
A wheelchair can walk.Separeted clean washrooms.One of bigger washroom is -2 basement floor but it take an elevator or stairs.

The restaurant phoned me for reserved confirmation on the day."}
{"text":"I ate at Joey's way before people here knew what Joey's is. 
As in at the original locations. 

It's okay. 

Fair menu. Okay bar. GOOD location.

Not great for takeout. 

I am glad big box kind of lounge/ restaurants are coming here though.

Safe to eat at a bit late. 

Sashimi Salad with double meat is the best. And that lava cake.

Very nice choice of apps. Used to have crab and artichoke dip --- don't think any location does now. And the menu seems smaller than it was.

It's not bad, not amazing either. Safe if you need to meet a few people for an hour.
Cost obviously depends on if you are drinkers. $11-30 vs $31-60."}
{"text":"We showed up on a Saturday early evening without a reservation and waited for a table to free up.  The suggested wait time was pretty accurate (and not too long). They offered some water, house wine and an app (pesto shrimp flatbread) for those of us that were waiting.  The flatbread was very good (we ordered it again for our meal). I had the rotisserie chicken (recommended by the waiter) and it was one of the best chickens I've had - very juicy and flavourful."}
{"text":"I come here a lot, but the best time to come is happy hour (3-6pm) on weekdays. A small selection of beers and cocktails are $4 and a few apps are only $3.50! I recommend the sliders - they really nail the fast food burger taste, down to the secret sauce, in a compact and appetizing form. Although they're small, they pack much more than $3.50-worth of flavour."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.
The service is so friendly and efficient! The staff is really exceptional.
The food is very good and the portion sizes are just right.
I find the prices better than other restaurants in the area.
I have dined alone, with a friend and with a group of friends. 
In every case the food and the service were very good.
I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great central spot to relax, eat some good food and watch some sport. 
I was solo so sat at the bar but the wait staff were very friendly and helped me order not too much food! 
I had the Korean fried Cauliflower which I loved - really tasty, cauliflower cooked just right, not too soft and a good portion for an appetizer dining alone.
I hung out for a while as was waiting for the Jays game to start and really enjoyed the Saturday afternoon atmosphere. It wasn't all that busy but there was a good buzz around, maybe due to the 2nd ALCS game starting in an hour!
Steak frites was my main which was tasty, steak was well cooked and the dish was exactly what I wanted. 
I like this place and I'll be back"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  It used to be better when it first opened.  Food portions, depending on the meal, appear to have changed over time.  The chicken fettucini alfredo pasta used to have a lot more to it, a really good size with a lot of fixings, delicious chicken and toppings.  Now it's about half the size, less fixings, and fairly rubbery chicken bits.  I used to always recommend this pasta but now it seems like it's a $20 app. Seems a lot of their food menu has downsized while keeping prices the same.

Still can't go wrong with the gyoza and lobster grilled cheese though!"}
{"text":"If you like young gorgeous servers giving poor service, this is the place.   Food was good and a bit pricey.   However, since I don't like to be mistreated and ignored by upbeat beautiful young people, I will never go back.  It started with the hostesses and carried over to the cheeky server, which indicated it is a probably an entity issue and not an individual issues."}
{"text":"Ah, Joey. You're like that hot ex-girlfriend I keep hoping has changed her ways, and maybe this time we can make it work. Nope.

I was persuaded to return this past Sunday (6 months later) by one of the friends who was with me last time. The location was convenient and it was the also first night in months he and his wife were going out with adult company since their baby arrived.

* Fries arrived cold (not even lukewarm). The server offered to \"take them back to be reheated if you like\". Duh. The kitchen shouldn't send fries that have clearly been sitting around for awhile, and if it happens you don't offer, you take them out immediately and say \"I'll get you some FRESH fries\".
* Tandoori chicken flatbread was far too sweet for a main course... so much sugary chutney it easily qualified as dessert.
* While clearing up, the server half-emptied a small bowl of soy sauce down the front of my buddy's wife's light-colored pants (ladies, I can feel you recoiling in horror). Apologies came from the server, and management brought a little glass of soda+detergent mix. He swore it \"gets out any stain\" (but unless they also brought some temporary pants to wear while she attempted to wash out soy sauce in the bathroom, it's a nice gesture but ineffective). Then he quickly made himself scarce.

What really surprised me was, at the end, there was no offer to cover dry cleaning, and no comp of any items on the bill. The manager could have come by to say something like \"We're really sorry you didn't have the best experience with us today. Was there anything else that you wanted to let us know about? How was the food/drinks this evening? Again, we apologize. The drinks you had earlier are on us, and we really hope you'll visit us again.\" 

Joey Eaton Center has a nice location and a great decor, but their kitchen processes and staff training are weak. If they can't serve consistently warm food and recover from mistakes gracefully, it makes one wonder what else is broken behind closed doors."}
{"text":"Service: Good, nice waiters. Wait for 2 people on a Friday was only about 15 minutes

Food: You gotta try the ahi tuna tacos. We ordered two rounds. The apple pie dessert is also freshly baked which may take a while but its totally worth it.

Ambience: Casual and lively with sports on various TVs. Not like real sports lively but more relaxed and entertaining to be dining at. 

Recommend: YES, great for large groups (make sure you make reservations) or even just small get together"}
{"text":"I love the food and drinks, atmosphere is great and the service is great! I recommend Thai chicken bites, mushroom soup, steak frites, lettuce wraps. The whole entire menu is fantastic."}
{"text":"A bar the size of a warehouse and a lineup to match, but leap over Joey's welcome mat and you'll get a great introduction to the city. 

There's a couple reasons to enjoy this joint: 

1) Size. It's big. 10,000 sq. ft. Bring your friends, hombres
2) Homegrown, babeh. In fact, Joey's is a Canadian product from the ground up, started in Calgary by BC native Jeff Fuller in 1992
3) Food. Classy and delicious, possibly even \"Canadian\". Executive chef Chris Miller's got some culinary buckshot eh? 

It was a friend's b-day. We came without a reservation for 10 - 12 people on a busy Saturday night at 9:00 pm, a staffer's nightmare. Hello lineup! But after only a 20 - 25 minute wait we were sliding into our seats.

ATMOSPHERE

Tourists, take note! Classy but not pretentious, roll yourself in this Hogtown chic: vaguely industrial but with fancy furniture. Dim mezzanine bar upstairs for some romance and creeping on people on the lower level, window seats for dining, high top tables for small groups, and big C-booths for larger group seating. 

FOOD

The template is classic Italian with global influences - Indian, Japanese, Chinese, etc. Par the course for 'classy' TO restaurants, and it certainly pays homage to the Italian impact on Canadian cuisine. (As I've said before, if a place serving \"Canadian\" cuisine included some Aboriginal influence - wouldn't that be neat-O? I can dream) 

Health nerds, good luck. Foodies, enjoy the take on your favourite dishes - sweet potato fries, spinach and artichoke dip, calamari, all at prices that won't break the bank. I ordered wine by the glass - a basic cab sauv that was decent but not exceptional and a sassy spicy Masi. Make this one your sip of choice, hands down! At $12 a glass, it ain't cheap, but the Masi is worth it.

SERVICE

Really standout performance by all hands on deck. Front door to table, our servers were pleasant, genuine and helpful. Our group size didn't make that easy. Shout out to our Markhamite server! We're everywhere.

LOCATION

Right at Yonge-Dundas square. Easy trip from the GO to the TTC to the restaurant. Yes, bust out those uncomfortable heels but don't forget the required Dundas-deke around the Batman mummer, the sidewalk preachers, and the plastic tub drummer.

OVERALL

Watch out for the line, but be sure to hit up Joey's for a Hogtown evening sure to impress touristas, your gals/bros, and your slightly-cleaner hipster friends. My friend's b-day was one to remember."}
{"text":"There's nothing I have ordered off the menu that I haven't LOVED. My absolutely favourite is the seared tuna salad..The dressing is to die for. The fried calamari was a surprise, cause it comes with all these extra fried tempura-esque veggies that are just as delicious as the calamari. Everytime i'm in Toronto/Calgary/Vancouver I visit this place and I'm never disappointed, the quality is the same across the country."}
{"text":"Given the options in the area... it's probably your best choice for a work event type lunch.  If you need to talk business and can write off your meal, this is the place. Everyone else, your millage will vary.  

That said, it's decent... sticking to the stand food items will be a bit of a let-down... they're good, but not out of this world good. So... take the time, go outside of your meal confort zone and try something new... that's where this place gets interesting.  Drinks are decent and the staff is awesome.  

The lunchtime crowd is pretty much all business so the place clears out by 1pm. After that it's much more casual and fun to hang out at.  If you're looking for an escape to have a drink at the bar... this is your place!"}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken. Was pretty good and decent size portion. Happy hour drinks were made extremely well. Good friendly staff for a busy night."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe that this place did not have a single main that was vegetarian."}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere of this restaurant-nice and cozy. The service was really attentive, but unfortunately, the food was extremely salty. The seasoning for the chicken slouvaki was drenched in sodium. For the price, I wish they would at least have fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Joey.

Food - I can give the chefs 4 stars for awesome food. They deserve it.
We had panang prawn curry (I liked it hot), pan roasted salmon (quite good salmon), and french dip (holy molly, the buns just melted in my mouth, roast beef just blew my mind. fries were just ordinary fries)

Service - I knew here servers are quite \"pretty\" but common she was quite rude by giving us the bill when we still enjoyed our soufflé. It had been around 30minutes. Worse thing came after. She interrupted our conversation and handed in the debit machine. Things got worse. I felt even offended when I had only $100 in cash, she asked me if i have small amount of cash with rolling eyes. She might be not wise enough to say nice to her customers. Would it be different if i were a male customer? I dunno. 

Atmosphere - is good for a date restaurant, or grabbing some drinks for special day. We felt the air was cold though.

Overall, I felt so sorry for the staff, back of the house. it would have been 4 stars if the servers acted \"professionally\" not just being \"pretty.\""}
{"text":"My friend doebach decided on this resteraunt to watch the leafs game. Delicous food and the prices werent to bad. The staff was also very perky, i would suggest it for anybody looking to enjoy an outing with guys."}
{"text":"I feel the need to write a little something after finally caving into the work-related hype surrounding Joey.  Yes, the deep-fried mashed potato spring rolls were good (it's a deep fried mashed potato spring roll...) but they weren't transcendent the way they are at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The mushroom soup was great, the Caesar salad less than average. My friend's fries tasted at least as good as the fries at McDonald's. That stands for something, right?

Now, my real beef. The desert. Everyone was blathering on and on and on about this chocolate lava cake. Ok, great. So it came, and it was under cooked. It tasted fine, but you could actually tell that this is some boxed pre-frozen thing that is shipped in and heated and slapped on a plate for ya.  Then someone takes a ketchup bottle full of raspberry crap and makes zig-zags on the plate. FANCY, RIGHT?? Pony the hell up. 

Bottom line is that a chain is a chain is a chain. This is a chain. Expect chain food. 

Also, the service was slow and weird--I get it, you're tall and pretty, but could you take my order/bring me my food? This is not to say that the hostesses were not welcoming, and friendly. They were--so give them the serving jobs!!!

Lastly, the washrooms were actually FILTHY. It was shocking and I wasn't impressed. Two stars--overall sort of a boring, weird experience."}
{"text":"I went to Joey's for an early worknight dinner (5:30pm, 6 people) and we were greeted with complimentary mini bellinis. Very nice!

Our server was friendly, although her conversation topics were a bit odd. The group was slow ordering, and she was quite patient with us even though the place was filling up.

I ordered the lobster grilled cheese sandwich with mushroom soup ($16). The sandwich was very tasty, albeit greasy. Best to eat while it's hot! The soup was also pretty good. Real mushrooms floated with a dollop of creme fraiche, not too salty.

It's a large open space with lots of suspended flat screens. The music is blasted and it's very noisy. There appears to be many suits who go there for after-work drinks and dinner.

All in all, Joey's is one of the better chain restaurants in the Yonge-Dundas area."}
{"text":"I decided to order something rich with my meal and upgraded the side order for French fries to Poutine when I ordered the Ahi club Tuna sandwich.  To my disappointment my poutine was served cold!  It looked like they poured cold cheese and gravy on top of my fries.  

The sandwich itself was okay.  I didn't send back the poutine because I was with a group and was not paying for my lunch. I expected something much better from them."}
{"text":"I had been to this location a few times before and received AWFUL service. Rude, absent-minded and generally unpleasant from everyone from the hostesses at the front, to the servers, to the bartenders. It was enough to keep me away for years. Having said this, during my last visit, the service was great across the board. I'm not sure if they've switched management, but it was like night and day. Also, the burgers that we ordered were yummy. Fresh and flavourful. Based on this most recent experience, I will be back."}
{"text":"Calamari and fish tacos are good. Butter chicken disappointing."}
{"text":"The experience at this restaurant was just awesome. Nothing to complain about. Polite and nice staff, amazing food, especially the steak and the mashed potatoes! Good desserts too, I recommend the molted chocolate lave cake. It's a really fancy restaurant, without being too expensive. Go here! You won't regret. I wished I saw it before my last day so I could eat here again."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! First off, I made a reservation for 1:30pm and we were seated right away, and the restaurant was about half full. We sat for over 15 minutes before anyone even took our drink order - and only after I pulled someone over to do so. 

After our drink order, someone finally came over to take the food order, and both dishes I have to say turned out ok taste-wise. However, my poor friend ended up getting food poisoning with her California burger. We again had to wait for the bill - and nobody checked on us throughout the meal to see if we were doing ok. They did apologize and provided us with a $15 gift card, but I don't think we will be back. My poor friend is now sick at home with food poisoning from the restaurant...I am very unimpressed, and will not be back."}
{"text":"I came here with the boyfriend while on vacation in Toronto. Our hotel was near the area and we wanted to find a nice restaurant with fairly reasonable prices that wasn't super touristy. We found Joey's on Yelp and decided to go for it even though we didn't have a reservation. We had to wait for maybe 20 minutes, but they'll take your cell phone number down and call when your table is ready. We decided just to wait in the waiting area, and a waitress came around with free samples of bellinis, wine, etc. Nice touch!

The interior of the restaurant is very trendy - reminded me of a lot of places in Chicago. They had nice big open windows in the front, but we weren't lucky enough to be seated near there.  The BF got the brie and cheddar lobster grilled cheese and loved it. I tried a bit and it was to die for! I got the butter chicken and loved it as well. I'm by no means an expert on Indian food, but I do love butter chicken and this hit the spot. The waitress helpfully told me that it was made with peppers and onions (because this is different than typical preparation) and I was able to get it without onions!

Paying the check was a breeze. Maybe this is typical in Canada but it is definitely not in the US - they bring the card reader out for you to swipe it at the table and you can input a tip right into the machine. So convenient, especially if you are in a hurry and don't want to wait for the typical back-and-forth that credit card payment requires. We definitely made the right choice in coming here!"}
{"text":"Went to Joey's yesterday for the first time.  Apparently this is a big deal.  So many people asked me whether it was my first time I started to get embarassed (not really).  Service was speedy verging on the ridiculous. Diet cokes were swept away to be refreshed mid-sip.  No less than 4 separate servers/staff came up to our table to ask how we were enjoying our meal, service, and, most importantly, \"Joey's\".  I heard the word \"Joey's\" repeated so many times I was tempted to tease the staff the next time they came to my table (and there were plenty of opportunities) what the name of the restaurant was again.  I started to wonder whether they had a merchandising department in the works a la Hard Rock.

As the other review points out the atmosphere is urban, post-work bar with waitresses in identical black dresses and heels, darkened lighting and a really exceptional al fresco front area.

The food, and it should be noted that it comes last in the review, was fine.  Nothing excessively good or bad about it.  Better quality and selection than some chains but still feels chainy - over mayonaissed, cheesed and baconed but within that scope fine.  I had the ahi tuna club  and it was cooked well but the mayonaisse and whatever else was on it overpowers the tuna - next time I would ask for the dressing on the side and it didn't come with a salad or fries.  I ordered a separate order of the yam fries and they were also fine.  In the end my verdict on the food is - fine.  Price - typical."}
{"text":"Great location for both lunch and dinner. Excellent service and very nice interior. This location is very busy all the time, so I would recommend making a reservation first. 

Just like other Joeys, my favourite dish is the 500 which is a quinoa salad, but loaded with ingredients. The couple times that I been there and ordered this dish, it was pretty consistent, except for one occurrence where it was a bit too salty. I like to come here for GT as well, as they aren't watered down like many other restaurants are.

The servers always checked on us to make sure everything was ok and always asked if we had any allergies and preferences with our dish. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday at 8pm on a date for drinks and it was surprisingly busy! 
We were put on a wait list and the hostest was very nice and chatted with us while we waited.
It was not a 15-20 minute wait like they said more like 5-10 minutes.

We were seated in a lovely booth at the window facing the street; great atmosphere, not too loud and great decor. 

Once seated we were greeted right away and our drink order was taken quickly.

We mainly had drinks, good beers on tap and ordered the rainbow roll which was very tasty and came quickly!

Overall for a place close to Yonge and Dundas I was expecting it to be stuffy and the staff to be snooty; it was the complete opposite. Even leaving the hostesses asked how everything was and said good bye. 

I was blown away with the friendliness and attention the staff gave. 

I'd go here again!"}
{"text":"I walked by Joey's many times and was intrigued by the classiness of what I knew to be a chain restaurant. Definitely a step up from Milestones!

The hostesses/waitresses too were in classy little numbers and while we waited to be seated, we were offered complimentary wine. Ultra class!

I regret to say though, the food left much to be desired and was bland to say the  least. Throughout the night, our waitress checked up on us in the oddest way - \"Do you have any complaints?\"; \"The food was okay, right?\". It definitely begged the question of how often complaints are sent her way.

I would've opted for 2.5 stars if not for the little shows of swank."}
{"text":"The first time i was here, i had a peppercorn steak. The best part of the steak was surprisingly the mash potato that is served with it. It is mash within a crispy spring roll topped with sour cream and bacon bits. It was amazing! 

The second time i was there, i had their chocolate soufflés. One word: WOW. 

The atmosphere is great. There's usually a long wait but they serve you small appetizers and drinks while you wait for a table!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere lovely, but service is terrible, food WAY below average. Toronto is a great city, with amazing restaurants, and to spend that much money and get let down, with poor customer service, is a huge disappointment. 

My daughter and I went into Joeys for lunch today. The day was perfect for dining outside, and we chose Joeys because we've never tried it. Yes, the restaurant was busy, but we had to wait 15 minutes to order, then another 20 to get our drinks served...then more time to get the food. The pulled rotisserie bbq chicken sandwich had bits of curry in it. The bun, soggy. Lettuce in the ceasar salad was limp, and the yam fries were tasty, but, for $9, there was less than a handful."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  We went on a Monday.  The waitresses are super friendly.  The ambiance is very upscale and unique. This chain from Vancouver made its way to TO just  about a month ago.  

We went pretty late at night around 11pm.  They were still serving food.  We sat by the open patio.  I swear we had 5 homeless guys walk by and one asking for food. 

The food is pretty good. The best thing on the menu i was told by the waitress Kat is the Tuna Ahi Burger.  The lightly seared tuna was topped with crispy deep fried onion rings, a pepper aoli, and some other sauces that I could not make it.  It is like a piece of heaven in your mouth.  The flavors exploding in your mouth as you try to figure out what ingredients were so astutely put together to create this food-gasmic experience.

We also ordered the chicken Flat bread which is also very tasty.

I would definitely venture back. For the friendly waitresses if not the food."}
{"text":"My favorite band Wilco was playing at Massey Hall on a Friday night, so I needed to find a place closeby to have a few snacks and beers pre-concert.  Here's my breakdown of Joey Eaton Centre:

Food (4/5): Pretty large menu including burgers, sandwhiches, pasta, steaks, etc. so there is something for everyone, however I did notice that a lot of the appetizers are asian-influenced (lettuce wraps, chili chicken, gyoza, etc.).  We shared the Sashimi Tuna Salad and the Tandoori Chicken Flatbread.  Both were great selections!  On a past visit, I had the Killer Ahi Tuna Tacos and they were indeed killer.  I would highly recommend either one of the items with tuna.

Drinks (4/5): For a chain, I was pretty impressed with beer selections.  Probably about 10 beers on tap but I noticed their bottled beer selection was good too - they had one of my favs Erdinger.  I had a seasonal Muskoka Harvest Ale.  Didn't pay much attention to wine list.

Ambiance (4/5): The room is very slick and has 2 floors.  Noise level is a tad high but bearable.  Good place to enjoy the game too, with a good amount of flat screen TVs without making it feel like a sports bar.  Crowd is quite mixed given the location, expect tourists, students, some after-work business types gawking at the service staff (Joey must have a strict hiring policy for staff that are easy on the eyes), and nearby condo-dwellers.  In the summer, the covered patio is very nice and looks onto busy Dundas street.

Service (4/5): The staff are very good at identifying when your drink is empty and the bartender provided us with her favorites upon request.  She had good taste since we enjoyed both her recommendations.  If you need a good workout after your meal, go to the washroom - it's a hike!  I called the same day for a reservation and was told that only 10% of seats can be reserved so we walked in around 530pm.  Joey was quite packed already, so we sat at the bar which we enjoy doing.  

Value (4/5): For a restaurant chain, I was quite impressed with the quality of the food.  Entrees range from $13-35.  We had 2 glasses of wine, 2 pints of beer, salad, flatbread and side of fries for $92 incl. tax and tip.  Felt a tad expensive but for quality food/drink and convenient location, I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain restaurant.  I'm sure all the hot waitresses don't hurt!"}
{"text":"Great location, amazing space with a good vibe and the food was very solid, but the lack luster service was enough to downgrade them from a 4 to a 3. 
Three business colleagues went to dinner. We shared a flatbread and yam fries as an appetizer. The fries were crisp and the Parmesan cheese and dipping sauce were nice compliments. The shrimp flatbread was really nice and the pesto and garlic did not overpower the shrimp. We individually had the paella, ravioli and steak frites. The steak was a perfectly cooked medium rare, but the fries were not as crisp as they should have been. The ravioli was a nice sized portion and very flavorful, as was the paella. 
The downside was that service was slow and not very attentive. Water glasses were often empty and cocktails/wine not offered when glasses were empty. It also took longer than expected after the appetizers for the main courses to arrive (they were busy, but not crazy). When interacting with the staff, they were friendly and knowledgeable, just not around as often as they should have been."}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the ambience. Service was amazing and food was great too. 
I have to say, this was the first time I got a seat after 4 attempts. Weeknights there is usually a 45min-1hour wait time. Today, I went for a late lunch on Saturday and finally got a place!
The ahi tuna tacos are delicious. My husband ordered the steak which comes with an interesting mashed potato spring roll side. He really enjoyed it. 
The best part of the meal was the molten chocolate shouffle served with raspberry and vanilla ice-cream!!! Soooo good! Please don't miss out on that.
Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Joey is your classic Canadian restaurant that serves a diverse range of dishes, from steaks, sandwiches to pasta. I come to Joey's quite often, and always leave with an average experience. Nothing too bad or special to say about it, other than it does its job to its standard and you can always go to it for the space and relaxed dining experience.

Recently, I visited Joey's again. We came on a weekday lunch and were seated right away. We ordered the NY steak and the mushroom pasta, and found both of them to be quite salty overall.

The mushroom pasta actually tasted like the server accidentally poured a batch of salt into the mix. I've tried other dishes here that were good/average, so I didn't let it ruin the experience anyway.

Overall, if you have a friend visiting from a foreign country and want to show them typical/average Canadian dishes in downtown Toronto, I recommend Joey's."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Looks very nice inside. Great food. Great service. Will definitely be my new go-to place for dates."}
{"text":"This review is only on the ALCOHOL (BEER) and not the food.

My friends and I have been going to Joeys recently and we noticed something about the beer. IT IS WATERED DOWN, YES....sad but true. There were four of us, one drinking Amsterdam and the rest of us were drinking Keith's since they have a Wednesday Keith's special.

There is no way in a span of 3 hours we can consume 11 pints each and walk out of there without staggering. We actually thought our alcohol tolerance had increased however at any other bar, usually 4 to 5 pints is good before we call it quits. Please be mindful when you order beer at Joeys, the same review holds true for the location at Shop at Don Mills and Yorkdale. BEER IS WATERED DOWN"}
{"text":"Regrettably, the service at this restaurant is so repeatedly terrible that I've finally come to write a poor review. The most recent occurrence happened today when I wanted simply to order takeout. I called and was put on hold for 20 minutes. When someone picked up, I tried to order pasta, al dente. The staff advised that she doesn't know what al dente means; I tried to explain what I was looking for, and she responded that she still doesn't know and, before I could respond, said she was going to ask someone and put me on hold yet again. After 15 minutes, I hung up and had to call in again. For a restaurant with subpar food, the service should at least be decent. Over time, I've only resorted to ordering from this restaurant as a last resort. I regret to say that I'll no longer order from here."}
{"text":"So, we've all heard the term \"Stepford Wives\"... well what about \"Stepford Servers\"?  Don't get me wrong, the service is great at Joey.  They offer you app samples and wine while you wait for your table.  They're also very attentive during the meal and they make sure to bid you farewell on your exit.  There's just something robotic about everything.  The fact that all their severs tend to be attractive females doesn't help.  When we left after our dinner, 3 servers/hostesses asked us the same follow up questions and said goodbye in the exact same words as the others.  Our server seemed to also just talk at us versus with us when she was seating us. Just a little weird.

That being said, their food is good, you almost forget that it's a chain restaurant.  The tuna taco app is delicious.  The tuna is plump with a great sear.  The slaw in the taco was quite refreshing as well.  A great sharing app, but not for more than 2 people.  I also got the lobster grilled cheese.  This is my friend's \"go to\" item, so I wanted to try it.  It was ok... not great, not horrible.  The lobster was a tad dry, and the bread was a bit greasy, but the cheese was nice and velvety.  Their fries are also delicious!  I was beyond full by the time I finished the sandwich, but kept finding myself shoving fries in my mouth.  Delicious.

I'll come back, but I'll get the tuna burger instead of the grilled cheese.  That's what I got onmy first visit, and it was hearty, fresh and tasty!  Something worth coming back for."}
{"text":"If I have to eat around the Eaton's Centre, this place is always a safe bet. 

There's always a line-up on the weekends but every time I've waited, they give out little testers of different alcoholic beverages which I think is a nice touch. 

I've always had great service and the food has arrive promptly. 

I mainly stick to the salads (The Beach is amazing but it is not on the Joey's menu at Eaton's right now since they are testing out a new salad but it's so good, the Shashimi Tuna is already great - the only thing is that the portion is quite small for the price). 

I had some kind of prime rib sandwich the first time I went but I don't see it on the menu anymore. It was really good and their fries were delicious as well. 

The Korean Fried Cauliflower is sooooo good - it tastes like sweet and sour pork but without cauliflower which actually works really well. 

Last time we went, I ordered the Molten Lava Cake for my friend since it was her birthday and it is SO DAMN GOOD. It takes 20 minutes to bake but the chocolatey-gooey center that comes out when you slice into it is so satisfying. 

I am not a fan of chain restaurants at all but this one has been consistently good in every way... except for the price. But that's to be expected when eating at a place like this!"}
{"text":"Enjoy this place.  The decor is nice, and the food is high quality.  It's not necessarily cheap but you won't be disappointed. One weird thing though.  Each time I visit I order a latte, and every time it's a challenge getting them to bring sugar and a spoon.  The latte is almost cold by the time the sugar comes.  Odd.  Usually this comes with the latte right away."}
{"text":"lobster ravioli - 5/5 I wish they had it on the menu all the time

butter chicken- 4/5

drinks and cocktails 5/5

I would come back again on special occasions! The serving sizes aren't very generous so be prepared to order more than just an entree if you want to leave full."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Joey Eaton Centre earlier this month and we absolutely loved it. The waitress was very kind and attentive. 

For drinks, I had a Bellini and he had a beer. The Bellini was very refreshing and my fiance loved it just as much as i did! We started off with sweet potato fries, which we thought were fantastic. It was sprinkled with a little bit of Parmesan cheese and came with a dip that tasted like butter with a little hint of lemon (I'm not 100% sure). For entrees I had the salmon and he had the half chicken. Both were very good and we ended up trading entrees halfway. The salmon came with crispy mashed potatoes which was basically a spring roll but with mashed potatoes for filling. The salmon was perfectly done and nicely seasoned especially with the sauce and the chicken was very tender. For dessert we had the apple pie which was amazing. It's not overly sweet. My fiance is not a big fan of sweets and he loved it. The pie was made fresh and it's not like your typically pie. It's an individual one and not a slice. It's served hot with a scoop of ice cream on top. 

Overall, it was a great experience. For all of that, I believe the bill was just over $100 and that included the tip. I understand why some people would find it expensive because of the smaller portions but I think it's the quality that matters. Plus, the size was perfect for us because we don't eat too much. We finished all our food. I think it is worth a try but don't go expecting huge portions."}
{"text":"6 of us came here for drinks.

I enjoyed this place because it was chic and the service was really good.  Our waitress as well as the hostesses were incredibly friendly and were able to point us towards some local watering holes.  

The 1 mile walk to the bathroom was interesting.  I also enjoyed the huge photograph in front of the urinals, want to know what it is?  Go and find out! muwahahahahahaha"}
{"text":"We were in Toronto from Chicago and Detroit for a long weekend two weeks ago. Another bartender recommended Joey's for some college football. We went there, and they had games on all of their TVs, which was great. We just sat at the bar for drinks and football, then along came the best bartender/server I have had in a while at any place. Her name was Tamara, and she was amazing!! She was very personable, and although the bar was pretty busy, still made time to make sure we were good. We were getting hungry, so she recommended the Sushi Rolls, they were out of this world!! We stayed there for a couple hours that Saturday because of the service. Sunday rolled in, and we wanted to watch some NFL, so we stopped back in there to catch some games. They turned on whatever game we asked for, if they had it. Tamara showed up later in the afternoon to start her shift, and was still on top of her game. Another guy was in town from Chicago, and asked here what she recommended for food, and when he got it, said it was the best thing he had eaten in a while. Great place, great atmosphere, and Tamara made the whole thing come together. Go to Joey's for good food, and good service!!!"}
{"text":"What is up with the waterfall picture in the men's washroom?!?! Who is the man? Why is he there? What does it mean? The photo takes up like half the wall in front of the urinals. I asked the manager and he said he didn't know. It's confusing."}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty, and would get a four star, but it's overpriced for what it was in my opinion. Plus, service was mediocre - pretty slow to get anything. We did go at lunch, so they were busy, perhaps they need more staff during the peak times. 

Also, on a separate visit, they don't really accommodate toddlers that well. Not the most family-friendly place."}
{"text":"Food 5/5
Services 5/5

Friend had a birthday gathering on a Friday night. With large parties, you will always run into the problem of parties being late. Not only did the waitress didn't mind, she actually helped us add additional tables and chairs when more people showed up. Not to mention the waitress was SMOKING. 

I ordered Moroccan chicken and it was AMAZING!

Definitely would go back again and again."}
{"text":"I've been here three times; each time was an enjoyable dining experience! The food is delicious, and presented beautifully. The servers are very nice and helpful. The atmosphere has a nice ambiance as well. The restaurant seem to be very busy each time I went, and unfortunately I had to wait about 45 minutes to 1 hour to be seated (however it was really worth the wait.) Otherwise, I really love Joey eaton centre and would come back anytime.
I really like their bleu cheese steak and their chocolate souffle is to die for!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice and the service was pretty good overall. Had the Baja tacos which were actually pretty good. Yam fries were excellent as well. Overall a great place for comfort food, much better than other chains such as milestones or moxy's, Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and ambient of this restaurant is really good for gathering but can get can rowdy. 

The food is at best mediocre IMO but might not matter much if you're only there to have a drink and socialize.

What I do like about this restaurant is that it is located in the heart of the city and it has a fantastic view if you're able to snatch a table out in the balcony. Plus the servers are really helpful with menu suggestions.

What I don't really like is that the restaurant can be a little pretentious so you have to dress up a bit to fit into the crowd.

I would recommend the burger and frites.  They're not the best but its probably the most appetizing on the menu.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Food is delicious,however small portioned and over priced.There are much more interesting sports bars you can go,which are cheaper and great food.Not to mention. the night i was at,the dj played like 4-5 r kelly songs.Unless you like r kelly,not your style for music"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it, and so did my boyfriend. I ordered the butter chicken with jasmine rice and raisins. My bf ordered a mushroom burger I believe. He said it was the best burger he's ever had and my bf is a meat head! So it must've been that good. My dish was amazing. It was my first time eating butter chicken and I absolutely loved it. Not to mention the raisins in my rice. It added a calming touch to sooth the spice from the butter chicken and garlic naan bread. This place is a must go! You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food- my favourites were the mini grilled cheese with salmon sandwiches and mini burgers (both meat and vegetarian were offered). We had the bottom area rented for a private function. It was festively decorated and the staff were extremely friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"To me, three things must come together to make a great restaurant: ambiance, great food, and great service. Joey at the Eaton Centre has all three.

The first thing that impressed me was the warm greeting I received when I arrived at 6pm, and asked for a table, without a reservation! They still treated me like a welcome guest, and even offered me a sample of their featured wine and plied me with some spicy chicken appetizers! One of the hostesses, Shardee, even struck up an engaging conversation on the restaurant and its clientele while I waited. The 25-minute wait shot by in no time. 

At the table, my guests and I were treated to really knowledgeable bartender (Gianna) followed by an equally well-informed server named Katarina. She could speak with authority on the ingredients of each dish that we enquired about; and remembered to accommodate the allergies peculiar to one of my guests.

The food was great, and just as described: the maple glazed salmon was especially good, drawing raves from the most critical one among us; my top sirloin was cooked exactly to order, and the two guys who raved over their seafood tacos had plenty of praise, attenuated by only one minor complaint: the soft tortillas could have been a little fresher.

Service was prompt, attentive and good-humoured: the main courses arrived in about 20 minutes. The background music, while upbeat and loud, was not overpowering. 

Everyone in Joey just seemed energized and having a great time. No wonder every table was filled on a Wednesday night!

Kudos to the designers, the chefs, and the servers who make this restaurant a star!"}
{"text":"had a great evening and nice early dinner. wife and i sat on the bar just around 6pm on weekday. place was very busy. service was great and very personalized.
we had the lettuce raps - very disappointing and not at all what we were thinking!!! (we love the ones at the cheese cake factory with lots of meat, dressing and veggies to make your own style)
the burger which was amazing! 
the tuna club was ok - nothing special
we also took a sushi roll we saw lots of people having and also we felt was just ok

drinks were great and the vibe was great as well. 

in retrospect, we should have done smaller meal and attend few other locations for a bar hopping  evening but place over all was great!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, especially for groups. Food portions are too small for the price (Eg I could easily eat 2 dishes of the fish tacos, and I'm not a huge eater), service is inconsistent and there is much better food in the area. Huge waits without a reservation. Overall, just not worth it."}
{"text":"I went back after receiving a gift card from Joey which was an unexpected and a very nice gesture. Again, food was really good. There is always taster at the waiting area ,which is great. And,the cutlery were spotless this time around!"}
{"text":"i usually don't like western food but for some reason, maybe it was the atmosphere or the big space here but i really enjoyed my time here. it's a good place to go for dinner, chill and work off those calories by going to the washroom. i swear, that's a trip in itself as you have to go down flights of stairs"}
{"text":"Sangría delicious!"}
{"text":"The thing about Joey's is: the food is good. Decent burgers, good entrees, typical fare you'd expect for a busy chain restaurant located near the touristy Eaton Centre. But my goodness, the other problem is that the service is almost always lacking. 

It's not to say the service isn't prompt and polite; it is, but good luck trying to get flatware if you're missing some. A friend and I sat on the 'patio' for burgers once and had trouble flagging down a server to bring us forks and knives for nearly fifteen minutes. One outright walked right past us, saying, \"I'll be there in a minute!\" only to never return. There's a strange feeling when you walk in that if you're not wearing a business suit or high heels, you should probably go eat elsewhere and this feeling persists as your time at Joey's goes on. On other occasion, there were a series of employees gossiping and arguing about some sort of issue on the floor near our tables. A side of drama with your salmon? Bound to find it at Joey's. 

It's a shame because the food, as I said, is decent, but I haven't been back since. A friend recently said she was going on a date and all I could do was laugh and say, \"Good luck.\""}
{"text":"Went there on last Friday night for a friend's birthday, ordered Panang Prawn Curry Bowl. It's made with coconut milk, peanuts etc and served with rice. Little bit spicy but very yummy. Comes in small portion size, but quite filling. They charged a friend of us twice but fixed it when he informed them. So, it's better you check the bill before payment. 18% tip was automatically added as we were a group of nine people. Overall service was good and I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were a party of 8 but were seated at a table suitable for 6. The music was set at least 100 decibels so conversation was next to impossible. I ordered a steak medium rare which came well done. I sent it back and waited until everyone else had finished their meals before I got a new steak. This time it was cooked properly but was very tough. One friend ordered a tuna salad that was supposed to have mango but there was none to be found. Another friend ordered roast chicken with gravy. He asked for more gravy and by the time it arrived, he had pretty well finished the chicken. Then they had the nerve to charge him $1 for the extra gravy. Fortunately, they took it off the bill when we complained and they had the good sense not to charge for the steak at all. I wouldn't have written the review except the Joey's website has no contact address."}
{"text":"This isn't going to be a usual review of food, but more of a comment on the business itself.  I was here for a late lunch with a friend who knows the food and beverage industry.  I ordered one of their salads, which was very good.  

Our waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  It was noticed that all the wait staff are women, and our waitress acknowleged that only women are hired for wait staff and men are only hired as bartenders.  Looking at the atmosphere, it looks like they are going for higher-end clientel.  They must be trying to attract men with money or sugar daddies.

Since this is 2011, there are plenty of women in business who are in management and C-level positions (i.e. CEO, COO, CFO).  It's not really appropriate place for business entertainment since it's really a highend hooters.  It's old school to think that it's okay entertain an important business client by taking them to the local stripbar.

Ironically when we were leaving, a pair of waitresses were getting out of a taxi, wearing little tight black dresses.  It looked like a scene of highend escorts arriving for work in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Good service. Average chain restaurant food. 

Came here for dinner with friends. I've been to this location and the other ones before but it's been a while. Decided to try the lobster grilled cheese ($20), it came with string fries. The string fries are not my fave, would be better if it's just regular fries. The lobster grilled cheese was kind of greasy. It's just 2 slices of bread grilled with lots of butter with a cheese and lobster mixture inside. Couldn't exactly taste the lobster pieces. 

I won't come here unless I have to..."}
{"text":"Excellent
My frist lunch in Canada

Try the \"balsa\", was delicius
The desserts are the best"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night for drinks. Drinks were good. Our waiter was not too knowledgeable on her wines but I guess her looks made up for it? haha Beers, wine, mixed drinks were as expected- good variety. The Molten Lava Chocolate Souffle with icecream and fresh rasberries (as someone has provided a picture for) was good. The restroom took quite a journey to get to but it was nice and comedic sayings were posted along the walls along the way. The Grammy's were on the big screen, as well as numerous other shows around the tvs at the bar.  We wished we could have heard the performances over the background music but the environment was still fun with hiphop music playing- both old school and current ."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, and solid food, however personally I found the place to be a little too loud for my liking on a friday night. 
We had the tuna tacos, the bbq salmon bowl, and katsu salad. The only thing that really threw me off was that the tuna tacos were not actually tacos, there were no taco shells whatsoever and the plate was actually just pieces of tuna sashimi surrounding a green salad. That was quite disappointing as nobody explained this to us and the name was obviously misleading, in fact we had also ordered the katsu salad because we were under the impression that the tuna tacos did not have any greens. However the flavors were all solid and I think this place does deserve a solid 4 stars despite my overconsumption of salad that night."}
{"text":"This place is all about location. Beautiful inside with terrific staff but skip the food. Presentation of the meal is excellent, quality and taste is average at best and price is above average. Stop by for drinks. Eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant in the downtown core. Make sure to treat yourself to the fish tacos and chilli chicken appetizers and you'll have a party in your mouth! 
For main, I stick to the beach salad - yum! 

The service here is top notch - from the hostess to management. Simply Superb!"}
{"text":"My review may not be completely relevant to the upstairs bar portion of the restaurant since I was here for an industry event and we were seated at the private dining area downstairs; as a result we had a reduced menu and no concept of prices... firstly, that was a very excellent place to host functions, easily seats 80 people, nice bar, fancy atmosphere. Food wise, however, I was less impressed - Moroccan soup was waaaay too salty. Should've guessed when the waiter told me it was very \"savoury\"! Sauce was much too heavy on the sashimi salad, although the concept of the dish was quite interesting."}
{"text":"I was very happy with everything.  They have legit buffalo style wings (as a side bar..it seems Toronto equates over sized over breaded wings as a good thing...they are authentic at Joey..not breaded..crispy and great flavor!) The burger was excellent. The staff were attentive and friendly. It seemed everyone was smiling and engaging.  It appears they are well trained and managed.  It's not fine dining but honest, good food supported by an attentive and engaging staff.  
Worth noting..the staff is model-esque...tall beautiful people. Im 6'7\" and felt like I was normal height. The other patrons were well dressed and trendy. I'll make this a regular haunt on my frequent travels to Toronto!"}
{"text":"** 4.5 stars **

I'm normally not one to write about \"big-box\" or chain restaurants. But I have to give Joey credit where it's due.

I was at this huge, slick establishment Tuesday night for food and drinks with friends ... and I had a better time here than I actually anticipated!

We intended to wait at the bar until we could get a table in the dining area, but we decided to stay, despite reservations we'd all bump elbows and spill drinks. Neither a food nor drink disaster was had.

I took a chance and tried the grilled lobster-and-brie sandwich with fries (which I was warned was rich but would be filling - REALLY? Do you KNOW who I am?), which I washed down with a couple glasses of white wine (Megalomaniac's riesling). Just right!

I'd say pricing of food is comparable to Milestones - maybe a touch higher.

And in addition to the company I kept, I have to tip my hat to our server Randall, who was outgoing, informative with our questions about the food, as well as great with the service and keeping us entertained and happy.

Despite the fact the place was super-busy, it wasn't too loud that I felt like shouting at my friends over the din. (Plus, I'd say our perch at one of the corners of the bar gave us a decent vantage point for looking around - especially for one of my friends, as it turned out.)

Overall, I'd say we struck it lucky and had a good experience. I'd go back, and hopefully my next visit has the same outcome."}
{"text":"Their Chocolate lava cake is the best in town! I can go there just for this dessert. Their tuna salad is a must-try as well."}
{"text":"This past Sunday afternoon, a group of my friends and myself went to Joey's at Yonge and Dundas location to celebrate my birthday that had already passed earlier in the week.  I heard about Joey's through my friend so I wanted to give this restaurant a try.

Once I got into the restaurant, I was quite impressed with the restaurant's decor and atmosphere. It made me feel comfortable right way. My group sat at a booth that accommodated 6 of us in total quite comfortably. 

We began to order our food. Two of us ordered the California Chicken Burger and two of my other friends ordered the Fish Tacos with Shrimps. One other friend ordered a dish of Steak Frites.

Food: The California Chicken Burger I had was not too bad. The spicy mayo made the burger really tasty and a bit spicy in the taste. The California Chicken Burger had bacon, chicken, lettuce, tomatoes inside. The burger bun was a bit hard to bite on but it's still very yummy. The fries were pretty good except it's a bit salty to my liking. 

Washroom: Restaurant's washroom is fairly clean and a good size. My only complaint with the the washroom is that it is two floors below the the ground floor and it's a bit of a walk. You should follow the signs to the washroom so you won't get lost. 

Service: Joey's service was extremely slow and definitely it is an area the restaurant needs to improve on. It took our waitress over half an hour to get our food out to us. We ordered desserts and it took more than 40 minutes to get Apple Pie and Chocolate Souffle.  My friends and I were quite irritated with the slow service. We made our views known to the manager and he's kind enough to waive off the desserts."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved our visit to Toronto a couple of weeks ago, and our meal here was a highlight! My pregnant wife ordered some excellent lemonade options from the non-alcoholic beverage menu while I enjoyed a nice glass of wine at our open air (covered) sidewalk table. Appetizers and entrees were great. I loved the ahi tuna salad (the dressing was perfect). And then came the desserts. My wife had a chocolate lava something-or-other, which she loved. I savored every bite of the made-to-order, single dish apple pie (I opted for maple ice cream over vanilla). Our server, Spencer, was exceptional. Knowledgeable, attentive, and accommodating. When we return to Toronto, we'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I usually don't dine in establishments like this for the crowds and noise make it difficult to relax in conversation and enjoy the food.  However, we tried Joey Eaton Centre after theater Saturday for it wasn't too crowded at that time.  We were graciously received and quickly taken to our seats.  Our server, Anastasi, always smiled when she spoke to us, engaged us in conversation, and provided great service, including having my partners phone charged.  We found the wine selection good and not overwhelming, and the food creative and delicious.  I will return."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with this place. Went here for my birthday, not expecting too much, and tired of Jack Astor's. I was pleasantly very surprised! The music and lights were just right, and the food that everyone had was great. Very good service- we had a reservation, and got in right away. We were seated at a huge booth with plenty of room, and our waitress was just the right amount of attentive. The menu had plenty to choose from on it, and good drink specials. I loved the bellini- made like a real bellini, not just a mound of sugar! I will be going back, and bringing friends."}
{"text":"This west coast transplant inspired us with their fresh food and beautiful presentation.  Our server warned us about spices and even cautioned us about fresh cilantro as if this might not be appealing seated as we were in a sea of tourists. Could she not tell that we were gourmands in disguise? 

Service was friendly but timing was slightly off with entrees not delivered at the same time. Our dinner selections were Sashimi Tuna Salad, Blackened Basa, Rotisserie Chicken, and Baja Fish Tacos.  Starters included a Sushi Cone and Calamari. We liked it all.  The food was incredibly fresh and combined with upscale modern décor, for a moment we thought we were in a much more expensive restaurant"}
{"text":"Ambiance and decor is very nice and trendy. Very big space. Pricier, upscale version of a sports bar, but I can see why it's a nice place to stop in after shopping at the Eaton Centre. After a day of hedonism and consumption, why not consume more?

We ordered the Lobster Grilled Cheese ($16) and Ahi Tuna Tacos ($12.50). Both were yummy and there's nothing to complain about, but they're nothing special and the portion sizes aren't huge.

Service might be hit and miss. We were seated quickly and our waiter was great, but I later asked another passing waitress for some vinegar for our fries, watched her head to the bar to chat with her friends for about ten minutes before coming back with it. Not an egregious crime, and granted the restaurant was sparsely populated, but still.

3.5 stars out of 5. Worth going once, and maybe one more time if a friend insists. No outstanding flaws, but nothing special."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE! I held my wedding rehearsal dinner in the private area in the lower lever of Joey Eaton Centre. Not only was the space beautiful - complete with the perfect in-house background music & TV screens that can project pictures, monograms etc. - they even had microphones on hand for when the groom-to-be & I wanted to make a speech, also Nicole Gunter was amazing to work with and went above and beyond to ensure we were happy & inspired by the menu. The customer service from the Joey team leading up to the event was informative, helpful and on totally top of the details. It was such an easy choice for us! They had sit down meal options, but we opted for a cocktail style mingle party with passed hors d'euvers, where we had a giant sushi board and ice cream stations among many other passed bites. Nicole recommend the perfect amount of bpp - bites per person to ensure our guests were full & with her help we had a good range of meat, veg & fish options to have our bases covered for all palettes! When the day came, we were so impressed with the staff who had excellent communication skills and provided amazing service. Everyone who came raved about the food and everyone was full! Joey even made a pregnancy-friendly plate for one of the attendees who needed to be careful. They are the BEST to work with - HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I wish I could have private events there all the time!"}
{"text":"Better than regular bar food with a creative twist that actually tasted good.  Lively atmosphere. Front windows retract to give a open patio feel. Wait times can be long."}
{"text":"Vanglorious!  The Korean fried cauliflower was one of the best treats I've had ever.  I placed a second order for carryout (breakfast tomorrow).  Also appreciated the separate gluten free and vegetarian menus.  Great atmosphere.  Wonderful wine racks with glass that allows you to view the open kitchen.  Exceptional customer service, and a huge dining area make it a great place for a romantic date, or hangout with friends.  The restaurant boasts private dining rooms and ultra modern, clean bathrooms with black slate in the stalls.  Hilarious - signage designates how many more meters a patron has to walk before hitting the chic bathroom.  I ate the 500 salad (it's OK, great veggies, but little flavor) and Korean fried cauliflower (what, I never knew cauliflower could taste so good!!). Hubby ate the 5 oz. frites - good steak (though a little tough when cooked well done), salad, fries, and flavored lemonade.  He liked it.  We'll be back before we leave Toronto, although dinner for two set us back $95.00. 6/28/15"}
{"text":"My apologies, I was looking for the Eaton Center and being a visitor I thought that Joeys Eaton Centre was it. Turns out it is a restaurant! I guess it is always good to stand corrected by ever vigilant locals keeping an eye out for stupid, ignorant tourist to their beautiful city."}
{"text":"I would not come here again with a large group. Everything went well until we started trying to order food. The reservation was for 6pm - we didn't get to eat until 8:30pm. In my opinion, that's enough justification for the rating I'm giving them. I had to personally walk up to the waiter to ask for service, since he apparently didn't deem it appropriate to check up on us during the long wait."}
{"text":"The salads are fantastic here. They're very large and filled with a wide variety of ingredients, creating a very flavourful plate. The prices are a bit steeper as it's a relatively upscale, trendy restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere inside is sophisticated. But the restaurant is very big, so it may vary according to where the table is located.  We were first seated next to the window. The tables next to the windows are very close to the streets, so if you don't want to be bothered by the noise or any kind of smell from outside, I advise you to sit inside. We couldn't deal with the smoking outside, so moved inside. 
The food was nice. I had rainbow rolls and tataki streak, and my friend had protein style burger. The portions were just right, and they were displayed nicely. However, the sauce of the steak was salty for my taste. I really liked the rolls.  
The servers were kind, but it was kind of disappointing when one server kept trying to take away our dishes even before we had remaining food. She seemed so busy, so we tried to understand, but after a few more attempts, we were slightly annoyed because there were no people waiting in the lobby, and many tables were empty, which means there's no need to be in hurry to take away our dishes."}
{"text":"Really fun place to eat at! The food is definitely not on the cheap side but you get what you pay for! The portions filled me up and the drinks were good. The waiters and waitresses were super friendly and they even give you little samplers and water to snack on while you wait for a table on the busier days. My friends and I had a really good time celebrating our birthdays here this past weekend (: our waitress heard that it was our birthday and even brought out samplers of their Bellini which was pretty nice of her! 

The paella was soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Joeys is alright.  It's everything you'd expect from an eatery at the mall except with hotter waitstaff.

I came here after work on a Friday.  
Yes, the waitstaff is smoking hot... but the patrons are not.
Because of the location, there is a mixed crowd of mall goers, students, and professionals. Even though the venue is gorgeous, the vibe was weird.

If I'm going out for after work drinks, I don't usually want to be seated around shoppers and kids...  Replace suits at the bar with dudes with baseball caps and reusable shopping bags.

I put my heels back into my bag and put on my flat walking shoes I use for the TTC.

However, I did enjoy my wine and the food is pretty decent.

The fish tacos were the best thing we ordered.  
Crispy, fresh, and light.  They were amazing!

We ordered wings and they were tiny.  Only one choice of sauce. 
Don't come here for wings.

The lobster brie grilled cheese seemed like a good idea.  The first bite is delicious.  After a while, you just feel a bit gross... And then there's a super salty aftertaste that makes you want to brush your teeth like 5 times.

The fries were magically good.  I wonder if they deep fry them in crack, because they were addictive.

Overall, it's not a bad spot, I can see why other people like it.
The service was great and the menu is huge!
However, for after work drinks, I'm still heading down to King street.
Joeys is just not a spot for me."}
{"text":"I don't find the charm in chain restaurants but sometimes you can't say no when everyone in the group loves it. 

I get super indecisive when ordering at chain restaurants because most of the items are not worth the $$. 

Obviously settled for variety of items.. ahi tuna taco was just sad (what was I expecting...), tuna cone (sigh) and slider (burnt cheese?) 

At least the patio was nice and the waiter was friendly."}
{"text":"I am new to Toronto so I just stumble to whatever sparkles.

My first impression about this place is that it is a high(er) end sports bar.  Compare to Jack Astor and Milestones, this place is definitely more classy, well designed and open.  Look at the waiters and waitresses, they look like they are handpicked from a model agency.

In terms of food, I would just say mediocre.  I had their 7oz CAB Sirlion and I would say skip it.  They also serve sushi which blew my mind.  Is this a new thing in NA?  Should I trust a sports bar for sushi?  Is Yamamoto back in the kitchen?  I highly recommend  their roasted chicken entree.  That dish is pure 100% money.  The dirty rice and roasted chicken mixes like Kanye and Kim.  I can eat that (chicken and rice) all day.  The draft beer selection is quite large as well and their bartenders are knowledgeable in that regards.  One thing I noticed is that they care about their customer's food allergy, which is a plus.

Large screens everywhere, pretty girls walking everywhere.  Can't say I don't like it.


The End."}
{"text":"Joey, Earls, Milestone's, Moxies - all nearly interchangeable by my count. What sets this place a part is the service and atmosphere. It lacks the \"place to rub elbows with other people who want to rub elbows with you\" feel feel that Earls has  - and that's a good thing, it has much better screens for watching Toronto's myriad of lackluster professional sports teams, and a genuinely pleasant staff. I was here for the first time with my fiance last week and it wasn't the food that sold it for me, though there are certainly no complaints, but the service and atmosphere. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place!
The atmosphere was so fun, loved the Ginger Curry soup and the Panang Prawn Curry Bowl!!!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I went last night and sat at the bar. I had burger and was good in my opinion but the bar service.............. 
I got my bill before I ask for it and that no no for me. 
For all sport bar fellows out their, this is not the place for you to drink and enjoy watching the game. 
By the way the people were super nice."}
{"text":"Besides the similar menus you see at Moxie's or Milestones, the one thing the makes this place stand out is the interiors. Very well decorated place with a chic atmosphere. The best thing, and I mean best thing is the calamari appetizers. I can't get enough of that and I mainly order those whenever I come. The apple pie is good also, but come here for the calamari."}
{"text":"3.5. I've been here a few times now. This time, we showed up for an early dinner at around 6:30. The place wasn't too busy and we (party of three) were seated right away. It was a particularly hot day, and against my better judgement, I ordered a double Caesar and a plate of Ahi Tuna Salad. Now, normally, these two items on their own would have been just fine, however, coupled with spending a day in the sun, I was in for a bit of salt overload.

The Caesar was fairly standard; rimmed top, a spicy bean, and maybe a lime (as I said, standard, not really worth remembering).

The presentation of the Ahi Tuna Salad was quite nice: a bed of greens, tossed in some sort of ginger based vinaigrette, was formed into a circle and placed off centered on the plate. The salad was topped with peanuts and small mango chunks, with a fanned out avocado on top. The tuna, which had an excellent sear, was sliced and bordered the salad-circle, on the perimeter closest to the middle of the plate. At first glance, the amount of salad didn't seem to be that large, however, after starting to pick away at the circle, it became obvious that there was more than meets the eye. The vinaigrette had a sweet and tangy hum to it which reminded me of an Asian sesame dressing. The peanuts and crisp noodles added much welcomed texture to the plate. The tuna was bright and fresh with no obvious signs of neglect - although I did think that in contrast to the strong flavour of the dressing, was a little muted (the Caesar probably did not help in this department either). I ended up making a point to eat some of the slices of fish separately.

Overall, the salad was light, filling, and did not leave me unsatisfied."}
{"text":"A friend of mine goes at Joey almost once a week, so he took me there the last time I was in Toronto. I must say that I had a great experience.

The place is a bit noisy, but you don't go there for a meeting, of course. You go there to have some fun, and a good meal with friends. The service was good, and fast even if the venue was full. I got one of the best sirloin that I had for a long time, and just to give you an idea, I'm a big steak house fan. The baking, and the seasoning were perfect: the steak was literally melting in my mouth. I also took a side of vegetables, with some mashed potatoes that were astonishing.

If you are downtown, it's a very good place for some drinks with friends, but also to have a great dinner in a good ambience. As much as I like to try new restaurants when I'm travelling, Joey will be on my schedule the next time I'll be in Toronto."}
{"text":"Never going back here again.  The staff was rude, inattentive, and dismissive because I'm a single gay man dining alone.  I'm fed up with this and refused to pay for my meal.  Teach your staff some basic human respect.  Yes folks, homophobia is ( still ) alive in 2016 !!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance and service was great. But is very small portioned for the price and its mediocre. Wouldn't go back for their food. I would give it 1/10 if it's for the food alone."}
{"text":"Food was okay, a little overpriced for what you get. I ordered Osaka Sushi and it was meh. Ten Ichi in Scarborough makes such good sushi that any other place just becomes meh. The waitresses are amazing however and really know their stuff. Very honest and kind employees, I really have to give it to the manager responsible for hiring them. If you need to go the washroom, be prepared to walk 46 meters away as if you're travelling to an outhouse. You need to go down 2 flights of stairs, meters apart from one another. It's a maze. Make sure if you got to go, you don't hold it until the last minute."}
{"text":"Wow - really pleasantly surprised by this establishment! Excellent wait staff, food was really good. Would provide pics of food but it's all gone!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Can I give less than 5 stars? Is it even possible?

Ordered the Baja Fish Tacos, and I thought it would be fresh shrimp and fish since it didn't state \"BATTERED and DEEP FRIED\"... although I should have guessed considering what kind of restaurant it was.

Tasteless, unseasoned, the tortilla was old, dry and COLD. I think the guacamole was cut with at least 50% of mayonnaise added to save money and avoid putting a lot of avocados to make a real guacamole, because let me tell you, there was not enough of a guacamole-taste, considering what I paid for them ($13.75!)

Got 3 small pieces. I was still hungry, but couldn't stomach giving them more money to try more crap food.

Basically tasteless, bland, junk food and not for someone like me, who actually enjoys good, tasty food. 

Never coming back here to this rip off.

At least at Moxie's, they serve decently seasoned food, even if it's overpriced, and junky like this stuff; I've never had such disgusting food in my life. 

I could cook circles around these people."}
{"text":"Long time eater, first time reviewer. This restaurant wowed me from the get go. The hostess was outstanding and brought us to a perfect spot. I went with 7 of my closest and dearest friends. We started chatting and that's when Jennifer showed up. She was the most professional yet exhilarating waitress I've ever had. She pointed us in the right direction for the wines and she did not disappoint. I decided on the fish tacos and they were a revelation, perfectly cooked. Jen also continued the perfect service and it was arguably one of the best night of my life. All I can about this place is \"Boom Boom....Boom\""}
{"text":"After a mediocre night on the town, my friends and I decided to enjoy a beverage at this fine establishment. Our server Bailey was fantastic, along with her group of helpers. At the end of the night while sipping back the last drop we encountered trouble. Kevin, the narcissistic cordon imposter came over with arrogant courage and finished our beverages. Seconds after he vacated the booth with an hours pay in his liver. Kevin sucks. Fire Kevin. 

Five stars for the establishment and 1 for old kev dog. 

Victoria saved our day. Fantastic floral shirt and a fantastic person."}
{"text":"I had a better time at Joey's than I thought I would. I had just finished buying my boyfriend's work wardrobe at Zara and we were soon hungry. Brilliantly, he suggested Joey's and at around 4pm on a Saturday, the place was not that busy. Score!

We sat in a booth directly in front of the entrance, and I have to say, it was a great spot. I immediately turned to the wine list, and to my great happiness, they served an Antinori product by the glass (Peppoli). As a note, you can get 6oz or 9oz servings. 

For appetizers, my bf and I shared the Cheese Sliders which were oh so good. It basically tastes like a McDonald's cheeseburger served on a very nice, soft, buttery, brioche. It even has the pickles that I used to fish out of my McDonald's cheeseburgers, but which now I love. For my main, I had the Tuna Tartare salad and my bf had the Basa, which was a lovely piece of fish. For those who fear the \"fishy\" taste, there is none of that on the Basa (covered with lots of wonderful and delicious spices). 

The food is actually not that bad, and the vibe of Joey's is nice. If you do get a chance, pop in!"}
{"text":"We were seated in the outside area of the restaurant which allowed a nice breeze and people watching. I am happy to say, the hungry children were able to receive their popcorn chicken and French fries immediately after ordering. The presentation was cute and they devoured their meal. Our server, Rachel, very accommodating for my mother in laws gluten free allergy. They were thorough in ensuring her meal met her requirements. I had a sangria that was refreshing and went well with the pasta pomodoro which was delightful! It had a creamy lemon ricotta topping and nice crunch throughout it. The kick of spice was not too strong but welcomed as it tied in nicely. To add to the deliciousness, I had a side of garlic bread toast... I'm in love with this meal and this place."}
{"text":"Met up with some girlfriends while in Toronto and they suggest Joey, so of course I was down! While we waited for our table the offered us wine samples, water or a drink from the bar, which I know I appreciated after a long, humid walk from my hotel.

The food is very reasonably priced, with a large variety of options from sushi to steaks to tasty salads. I had the Spicy Chicken sandwich with fries and it was AMAZING. I usually steer away from spicy things, but this was the perfect amount of kick - it didn't leave my mouth burning but it was still something a little different from what I usually order.

We were seated at one of the long wooden tables, which were beautiful, but I wish the lighting was a little better! We tried to take a few photos inside and it ended up either being super dark or washed out from flash. Not a huge deal at all, but something to take note of if you're an out of towner like me.

The service was great - our waitress checked in occasionally but wasn't there so often that we got interrupted. My water glass was always full, and when she was around she was super nice.

We also brought a bunch of makeup to swap with each other (we are all beauty bloggers and like to do that occasionally) and the staff were totally fine with us spreading our goodies across the table and digging in. 

I really enjoyed eating at Joey - it's the exact kind of comfort food that I think of as \"Jodi food\". I'd definitely go back if I had the opportunity!"}
{"text":"Going to the washroom here is like going on a mini adventure deep into the unknown. 46 meters! The only downside i could think of from my visit there. The washrooms also just happened to be the nicest i have ever used.

Anyway on to the service and food. Service was great, i went on a Sunday afternoon so it was not so busy and i was seated pretty quick. it was not so busy and not too noisy so just right for catching up with a friend.

We ordered the cheese sliders and decided to share the steak and sushi main. 

The sliders were okay, plain and simple so a dollop of ketchup later and all was good. The steak we had medium rare and it came with what i think was rainbow roll. The sushi i thought was really good considering it is not a sushi joint and the steak tasted great although some pieces were slightly chewy. 

They got a few TVs up around the bar so i could see myself coming here again to watch the football."}
{"text":"Came in with my daughter and was seated right away. The waitress was very attentive and great with my daughter. She split a meal and customized for my lo, which I really appreciated. 

Great food and drinks, great atmosphere, great service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my evening here, and while the atmosphere and menu were fairly standard, my experience was made 100x better by our wonderful server, Shai Ann (not sure about spelling, sorry!)

Seriously, the staff went above and beyond to make our night great, even bringing extra maple ice cream for our apple pie (highly recommended btw-unreal amounts of flakey crust!)

Happy hour is amazing, food was unexpectedly great, and again, service couldn't be better. Thanks, team!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner a while ago with my boyfriend here. The decor is beautiful, but we were seated in a small table that was in the middle of everything. Would have preferred something more cozy, but can't complain as we didn't make reservations.

The service was quite good. Was a bit slow getting our bills and initial food but nothing outrageous.

I ordered the ahi tuna club which was bursting with flavour (the red pepper relish def. made it). Tasted pretty fresh and had a good balance of textures. My boyfriend ordered mushroom cheddar burger which he said was quite good also. Skip the caesar salad though - for $7 it was tiny and soggy (not sure if it was a bad batch but for that price I'd expect better). 

Def. going back to try some of their other items"}
{"text":"Oh, Joey. Baby.

I had a feeling upon entering your ridiculously cavernous interior and taking in the cooler-than-you vibe that my dining experience was going to suck. And aside from the deep-fried mashed potatoes (the sole reason that there was more than one star), it did. Well done gang!

I was a few minutes late meeting some friends, and they had their drinks already. 15 minutes after I sat down on a slow night, I was asked if I too, might want a beverage! I did! Way to stop talking to the other servers and pay attention to your tables, wait staff.

Aside from the aforementioned potatoes, the food is run of the mill pub food that would be considered pricey at half the price of what JOEY charges. 35 bucks for a steak the size of a hockey puck that was way under-cooked (asked for medium well, got rare) and plenty of fat and gristle to boot. Three of us got steaks, all of them cooked incorrectly. 

Mentioning this to the server got me a half-hearted shrug and an offer to take it back to the kitchen for them to put it back on the grill. Yes, please put my undercooked, and now cut, steak back on the grill while the rest of my party eats so the juices can leech out and I can eat a dry steak. How about we cook it right in the first place. If you're charging that much for a 5 oz steak, invest in some chefs who can properly prepare them.

Anyhow, if you like to be \"seen\" and don't mind attitude and mediocre, overpriced food, this is your kind of place. But there are so many wonderful, unique, delicious options for dining in Toronto - no need to subject yourself to JOEY."}
{"text":"Only came here bc my cousin was in town from SF and wanted to catch the game.  All the prior places we checked were packed.  Joey not quite and they had a huge TV screen. Huge downside is no sound as they were blasting some lame music in the background.  So back to the food and service.  Food was decent only and for the price it was a rip off.  Portions were small.  Some weird Asian fusion as well. But the worst part is the service, the wait staff disappeared and was no where to be seen for the longest time.  At the end of the night we wanted to get our bill she was flirting with this table and was talking to them for over 30 mins with her back facing us. Didn't care once to look around and see if anyone need her help. We weren't the only table that was looking for her at that time."}
{"text":"I had made reservations for a party of 18. They wanted 18% each on top of our meals. I know it was a large party but that's nuts. I ended up cancelling. So we didn't end up eating there"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Joey for numerous reasons.

1. The food is delicious! The Chinese lettuce chicken wrap is a must try as a shareable appetizer. The menu is a little heavy on the sodium but that's pretty standard for most restaurants these days.

2. They offer a complete vegetarian menu. Most places only offer 1 or 2 veggie options but Joey's has an entire menu. You just have to ask the waitress for one.

3. Service is always friendly and they work hard to seat you quickly even without reservations.

4. Nice decor and atmosphere. You can come here for a date or hang out with friends and watch the Leafs lose yet another hockey game.

5. Great location right beside the Eaton Centre. It's only a minute walk from the Dundas subway station.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the Filet Mignon, it was ok, the crispy mashed potatoes that comes as a side are unbelievable!! The service was ok, our server forgot our drinks, they never came, in general it's good, not sure if I'm coming back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Toronto. With good food, nice and modern place and the most helpfull and king team. I always have been very well attended and very well welcome!"}
{"text":"I was nervous to walk in here because it was buzzing and obviously the \"it\" place near Eaton but I was looking for a fresh salad so I gave it a shot. The hostess was incredibly friendly and made me feel completely comfortable. She offered a sample of the house wine while I looked at the menu and made it clear that even though I would be taking up valuable real estate on the patio--the last table (and it was for four) that I was most welcome. Wow! The quinoa salad was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced for the quality, quantity, and freshness--I could not finish it. I would go back and highly recommend this high-energy spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience. I went in for dinner with 3 other friends and it was extremely crowded despite being a Wednesday night so if you're planning on dropping in, be prepared for around a 15 minute wait. We were seated at a small round table with highchair-barstool type seats that I found to be extremely uncomfortable. If you have back problems, I'd recommend specifying to the hostess that you'd like to sit at a booth beforehand. I ordered the mushroom pasta and my friends ordered the lobster/shrimp ravioli, calamari, and a kind of roast beef sandwich that was served with a smokey jus. Considering that it was a busy night, I'd say our food was served relatively quickly which I appreciated. However, the quality of the food left much, much, much to be desired. I'm never one to leave a plate unfinished but I COULD NOT finish my mushroom pasta because it was too salty. I normally like my food a little saltier than the average person but this was way too salty even for me. Frankly, even if it hadn't been so salty, the dish would still have been subpar. The pasta was cooked to al dente perfection, I'll give them that. My friend who ordered the sandwich left half her food unfinished as well. The friend who had the lobster/shrimp ravioli really enjoyed her dish and that's the only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1. The service was awful as well with waitresses avoiding and blatantly ignoring us. A simple \"I'll be right with you\" would've been fine. Anyway, if you're downtown, there are so many better places to eat. There is nothing good to say about this place. If you have to go, order the lobster ravioli, my friend recommends it lol."}
{"text":"Where do I start with Joey's? 

The place is sexy, the staff is gorgeous and the food is legit! This place has an amazing location as well. Been here lots of times - from just a couple drinks after work to dinners and everything in between. This place never disappoints and is an extremely well run establishment.  Everything that I have tried on the menu is good. They have decent drink specials every night of the week. The service is probably the best in the city for this type of joint. The staff is attentive and is on top of things! Keep coming back for more, so nuff said! 

PS: You have to try the molten lava chocolate dessert!"}
{"text":"There is something in the air about Joey restaurants. If you aren't a male or a regular - get ready to be side lined. 

My server was very disinterested and allowed us to order quickly and took off. Never came back to check up on whether we needed more water or anything else. 

My friend and I were there right after the work rush so the place was busy and we didn't get a lot of attention. 

The food can be pricey but I love their salads so an happy to part with my hard earned money (even if it's JUST a salad!) 

Definitely won't be coming back to this location. When I let them know that the service was poor, staff told me that this Joeys location is completely operated by head office (or something to that effect) meaning there is NO manager for this location. Good luck speaking with any one. Perhaps I'll just have to hold for someone at a call centre in another country."}
{"text":"3/5 - kind of what you expect.

Joey's is massive, polished, and that translates into the experience - it's a comfortable place to come, they won't hurry you, you won't feel like you're missing X food or Y drink... but when it all comes together, it's just eh.

The service was smooth and friendly, but the food was eh. It was literally the definition of \"acceptably ok.\""}
{"text":"Ordered a salmon dish and to be honest it wasn't the best thing that came out of that kitchen. I truly think I could've made it the same at home =c with that being said, the atmosphere at the time of my stay was exceptionally busy as I guess it was right after work and there were many professionals seated nearby. The service was great though, I will say that because our server kept coming back with a big smile on his face and was so friendly, kept asking if we needed anything or more drinks, desserts, etc. Usually I mind when someone is constantly harassing me if I needed anything more but I realize he was just being attentive whereas some places only ask you once and you never see them again.

The service was pretty good, but the food is not that special, especially for the price. This was my second time at a Joey's and I don't even remember my first experience and that was probably because it didn't stand out. Wouldn't recommend this resto nor come by again sadly."}
{"text":"I was tempted to try out this place after having sampled the late night vibe in the Vancouver branch. Some clients from out of town were here and we were in the downtown core so I said why not. 
The place is pretty big and they seemed to have spent top dollar for the ambiance. There are options to sit inside/outside and even upstairs if you fancy. The service is quite prompt and they seemed to have selected the servers with a certain criteria (read tall and attractive) 
The food is standard fare (in the line of other chains like milestones etc.) I ordered a Tuna Taco and Lobster Brie Sandwich. Associates had Butter Chicken and Salmon respectively. One of the associate was a vegetarian and seemed to be at a loss as there weren't many options. After asking our server she said they can substitute the main course's protein with tofu (which is quite interesting as that opened up a whole lot of options for him.
 The beer list is quite limited and you will find mainly big brands here (Stella, Sapporo etc) The Tuna Tacos came fast and looked nice though the taste was ok with the shell being very crisp (not much heat though in the Wasabi/Mayo topping) and fell apart. Watch out folks you need to be careful eating this dish and I recommend using a napkin to hold the taco. The mains followed quickly and I was kind of disappointed with the lobster brie sandwich. There were tiny chunks of lobster and not much brie either the crust was soggy as well. Butter chicken was your standard westernized version with no heat.
I would give 2 star for food and 4 star for the eye candy :) 3 star overall. Don't expect surprises this is your regular mainstream food with nicer ambiance."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a few drinks before catching a movie. They have a cool bar area with lot's of TV's displaying multiple sporting events.  Service was good, the bartender was quick to offer us a drink and a refill when required. The place look's great and reminds me of other Joey restaurants. Didn't try the food here today but enjoyed a few meals at the shops at Don Mills location (the menu look's the same).

I would love to know who the hell designed the washrooms in this place! You need to go down a flight of stairs, down a hallway, more stairs and more hallways. Absolutely crazy. They make a joke out of it with some funny signs but it's very annoying. 

ignoring the fact that the washroom has a different postal code, Joey's is probably the best \"chain\" restaurant currently in Toronto.

{"text":"I was surprised by how much I liked Joey. They had great service that had no attitude, which is rare for a place like that. I typically would not choose Joey for dinner as there are so many more options with similar food around, but I went for a birthday party. We were a group of 20 on a Saturday night and they seated us upstairs. It was nice and calm up there but you could still see all the commotion that was downstairs. 

We ordered the Gyoza's with hot mustard and the sliders that came with some home made chips. The sliders tasted like gourmet big mac's and the gyoza's were pretty tasty. The drink special for that night was a double long island iced tea with slush.....I only ordered these because it was the cheapest drink on the menu other than domestic beer. We finished with an order of the Italian doughnuts which were incredible! As great as the food was, there was nothing really special about it that made it stand out for me. I've had similar sliders, and better gyoza's etc......

It's kinda too bad that I am a fan of this place as it was very over priced! The only reason I'll go back is if there is another party there, I doubt I will crave anything on their menu no matter how good the food was."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the nicest chain restaurants downtown -- a huge step above Milestones and the like.

I've eaten here twice and have had the peppercorn steak and the cheeseburger, so nothing too adventurous, but I was really impressed with both meals. My friends had a variety of meals and everyone left satisfied.

The service here is phenomenal, which I really wasn't expecting since it was a busy Saturday night and this is a HUGE restaurant. The atmosphere is great as well as you don't really feel like you're attached to a mall and huge windows look out over Dundas Street."}
{"text":"My niece invited me to have lunch here and I just loved the place, food, and service. I had chicken salad which was fresh and delicious. Service was perfect. If I ever go back to Toronto, I would definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"If you are at the Yonge-Dundas square looking for a great place to eat good here. We had a great evening. Wine was amazing and the food was also great. People here are very friendly."}
{"text":"Service was top notch. Very attentive, and he went above and beyond .

Food however, was just okay. My chicken and rib combo came lukewarm. My friend's medium rare steak came medium well. Luckily our server was as disappointed as we were and promptly ordered her a new steak that ended up better.

Decor was expected for a slightly upscale chain resto but it is what it is. Not everything was a hit and more than half the menu was well overpriced for what it was.

I don't anticipate me going back for the food."}
{"text":"I had been a few times when it first opened and always liked it, but I kept telling myself I was wrong because, for some reason, it's just easier to assume Joey isn't good.

It's a chain, it's in prime-tourist-trap location.  The servers are all hot females.  You're just pre-programmed to think it's going to suck.  And then, well, it just doesn't.

Seated in a nice big booth.  It took about 15 minutes for someone to come and even ask for our drink orders, which was strange, but the rest of the time service was very good.  I really love their girlie drink choices; the drink are sweet and strong.  Love their burgers, they were as good as I remembered, and the fries are almost like McDonald's fries (a good thing).   

Don't be suckered into travelling for ten miles to the washrooms located downstairs.  They have some hidden ones on the upper level....hard to explain where they are, so ask your server and hope they spill the beans."}
{"text":"My second time eating at Joey and I was once again pleased with the menu and the fresh taste of food here. One of my new spots when I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"Beautiful weather brought me to Joey's and I enjoyed my dinner very much. I had creamy Alfredo with chicken (I also added shrimp). I got a peach Bellini, made to perfection. Apple pie for dessert, they offered it with maple ice cream but I opted for vanilla (classic!). Waitress was very nice, very short wait and great atmosphere. Only one concern, the washroom was so far, I literally went down 2 flights of stairs to get to them. Plus I was wearing heels, but very female friendly."}
{"text":"Ive been to Joeys around 6 times now so definitely time for a review. I love the ambiance, atomosphere and drinks. The menu has sonething for everyone , I've tried pretty much everything , I am disappointed in the lettuce wraps. The first time I had it at the Yorkdale location it was  super salty , then I had it again at the Eaton centre location it was less salty but noticeable. Something in that dish is making it so salty but its  still sooo good to me  my blood pressure not so much . I wish they added more meat though its a bit on the skimpy side. The DonMills location rooftop  alone has made that location as my favorite to visit in the  Spring/Summer , with Eaton Centre  in second place for my choice for Winter /Fall . The lobster grilled cheese sandwich and the fish tacos are the best Ive ever had and Ive eaten seafood in Maryland !!!! The baked apple pie (Vanilla Ice cream only -I hate maple everything I know how unCanadian of me )  is so heavenly , next time Im ordering that first before my meal! Hahah Overall  Im always impressed with the service at Joeys Eaton centre & DonMills .Yorkdale not so much the hostesses are always confused , Ive had to wait half an hour for reserved table booking never again Yorkdale!!! !"}
{"text":"First time visiting today... Food was WAY over priced for what you get.  Waitress was great, service was great, but most significant... Food was tatseless and atmosphere too LOUD...

If your looking for a loud place to socialize with friends after work, this might be your place.  But if you're looking for tasty food, save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Elderflower Collins is a perfect choice for cocktail.     Environment is good and server Jess is nice."}
{"text":"Its nice to see western chain restaurants making the big jump into the Ontario market. 

Joeys Eaton Centre made me feel right at home! 

A perfect central location at Yonge and Dundas makes for a HOT SPOT on a Saturday night downtown! The wait was nearly an hour... but after giving my phone number, we perused the mall until the call came. Great way to take advantage of downtown life! 

The food was typical. As a vegetarian I love Joey's because of the option to substitute Gardein soy chicken into most dishes.

All in all... typical chain restaurant service."}
{"text":"I went for lunch at Joey yesterday afternoon as more of a research project than a whim. I've heard several restaurant consultants recommend that Joey had an ideal business model from food costs, to menu production, staffing and corporate structure.

When it comes to restaurants, I hate the corporate structure and like to support smaller businesses that are doing their own creative thing. 

I walked into Joey with many biases.

We were greeted by two pretty hostesses in black tank tops and skirts. We asked to sit by the sidewalk as I've always been jealous of the plushy banquettes and the frosty cocktails when I walk by. All the banquettes were full, so we were shown to a round table nearby with ample room for our things.

Service was attentive and there was a server at our table within half a minute of being seated. I ordered the Oyster Bay Sav Blanc and my boyfriend had a Rolling Rock. We were impressed at the menu and how it covered all the bases from Mexican, to Italian, to traditional pub favourites seemingly without sacrificing freshness for price. However, this is part of the corporate model of being everything to everyone and increase your purchasing power by keeping all your menus the same at all locations. I normally prefer a place that specializes in what they do rather than doing an ok job of everything. For our mains, my boyfriend had the Baja fish Tacos at $14 they don't include a side. I had the Aji Tuna Salad $18 and we split the Fried Calamari to start.

For $13 the Calamari was okay, but nothing special and I think the price could have been a little lower being that half the order was deep fried green beans and fennel. There were no tentacles, but all rings. The batter was crunchy and flavourful.

The Baja fish tacos were outstanding. Soft corn tortillas with breaded shrimp and fish with a side of Valentina's sauce (they don't tell you this, but that's what it is). The three tacos arrived nestled vertically on the plate in a taco stand to keep them from slopping all over the plate. 

My salad, which could have been wonderful was a colossal disappointment. The menu said that it had a cilantro mint dressing. That sounded like a delicious accompaniment to the avocado, tuna, mango and crispy noodles. I was a little wary of the mango, as I don't like sweet things in my salad, but reasoned that it was likely just a small amount that would add to the flavour balance. 

The salad looked like a work of art: crisp lettuce with crunchy noodles and peanuts with a fan of thinly sliced tuna capped of with another fan of ripe avocado. The outside of the salad was skirted with, what I am assuming, was the cilantro mint dressing, because the dressing that was on top of the salad ruined everything! It was so sickeningly acidic and sweet that it overtook the delicate flavours of the tuna and the wonderful buttery avocado. The two best things about this salad were drowned in this terrible stuff.

With tuna, I would have expected the cilantro and mint, coupled with some sesame and maybe a whisper of powdered wasabi. The hot, sour, nutty and herbal balance would have worked-- even a little miso paste to add umami... but this was nothing but dissolved sugar and rice wine vinegar. I was so sad that I ordered another glass of wine.

After 15 minutes I noticed that my wine had not arrived. I was nursing the last bit of my first glass through the beginning of my salad, but now that I was empty, I was thinking that they had forgotten about it.

I asked a nearby server if she could check and she apologized and said it would be there shortly, explaining that sometimes when they change the printer paper the orders don't print properly at the bar. I can appreciate that. So I waited another 10 minutes while my boyfriend took the apparently long trek to the toilet. When he came back, my wine was still not there. I'm a server, and if I forget a glass of wine and the guest reminds me, I make sure to hustle that glass over--Especially if they are almost finished their main--they don't want the glass of wine when their food is finished and their companion is not having another. 

Finally, the server brought my wine and thanked me for being patient. I expected that a big chain place could afford to comp something or bump my pour from a 6 to a 9 oz. since I had to wait so long. There was no offer of this.

Overall, I would say that Joey would be a good place for a post shopping cocktail with friends, but the food is hit or miss and their service, while courteous wasn't much to brag about. Maybe the high heels the servers were sporting slowed them down a bit. Really? High heels while working on your feet? If this is required as part of the uniform, I'm shocked. Shoes like that will ruin your back and your body just walking around in them. It must be torture to work a shift.

The corporate model got my money. But I'm blaming this on research."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure going to Joey's. I've been to this location a couples of times now and still the same with good service and great food. Honestly I think you can pretty much order anything on the menu and it'll taste great. The portion is just perfect to keep you satisfied - which I prefer to being super full. Servers are friendly, polite and decently quick. The waiter who brought out our food wasn't our server and he gave a bit of attitude when I asked for a fully hard boiled egg - I specifically asked for it to be fully boiled beforehand and not soft boiled. He took it back with a bit of an attitude. This was quickly resolved with our server who acted quickly and politely by getting me my side while they boiled me a new egg. All in all, my experience was good and I never turned down a night out to Joey's."}
{"text":"It's rare I'd give a big chain restaurant like Joey's 4 stars.  I used to frequent this place a lot for business lunches.  Joey's always has decent food for reasonable prices, and gives you a good dining experience.  Most guys enjoy this place for the waitresses.  Admittedly, the fact they all wear tight black dresses does help.

They've got a big menu that ranges from sushi to burgers.  I've had a good chunk of it.  Off the bat, I'll recommend the following.  

App: Calamari/Chili Chicken
Mains: Beach Salad, Baja Fish Tacos, Lobster Grilled Cheese, Blackened Basa and surprisingly the burger was also good.

There are dozens of great independent restaurants in Toronto - I would consider Joey's EC as a safe spot for lunch or dinner.  I put it on the same level as The Keg; a chain restaurant that's typically reliable.

The downside of this location is the washroom is 2 flights of stairs below.  Tip:  There are unisex washrooms in the back on the main floor."}
{"text":"Can hardly understand how this place got a 4.5 star average rating. It's at best, a 3. Terribly slow and offhand service, despite being almost empty. We sat in the window and it was Arctic cold, when I asked if they could adjust the A/C, was rudely told that nothing could be done without even an apology. 

All this would be fine if it wasn't so hugely overpriced for what it is. Bland, boring food and overpriced cocktails. And the bathroom is about a mile walk underground. 

Nope, never again."}
{"text":"I'm a tourist from the States and came here last week. I got the Ahi Tuna and it was delicious. The ambiance of the place is very stately and relaxing, with a nice patio as well!
The reason I'm leaving a review here though is for my amazing server Alexandra R. She really went above and beyond in answering my questions on the menu, suggesting a nice wine and was really attentive to my needs. I never had to flag her down. Also, I'm impressed with the professional look of the restaurant, which is clearly emulated by their servers. Thanks again, and I look forward to coming back if I visit Canada again!"}
{"text":"Waitresses are not very friendly this evening compared to the last time I was here.  They are cold, robotic, and impersonal.  Unlike the last time we were here And had a fantastic bartender named Vanessa?  Anyway, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Finally, a good restaurant at the mall!

We had to wait 10 mins for a table, but the pain was lessened with a free wine tasting- a really light and summery chardonnay

Service was great; our server was uber friendly and accommodating

Killer Ahi Tacos were tasty...small but tasty. 
The lobster grilled cheese was good but way too salty and rich for me (and that's saying something). i couldn't finish all of it. 
Yam fries are the way to go!
 
will be back!"}
{"text":"Prime sirloin was nice and juicy, and I really liked the side of mashed potato roll in pastry. The pounding music was annoying, though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere
Wicked service
Amazing food
Reasonably priced

Don't let the the outside fool you.  They do everything to make you feel welcome.  This is definitely a place to visit - you'll soon be back.

Way to go Joey's!"}
{"text":"Great food in a superb location just west of Dundas square.  Shrimp and spaghettini was excellent with the flavor of homemade pasta coming through.  Lively and hip crowd with friendly bartenders and wait staff.  This would be Cheers if Cheers took place in a modern day city center."}
{"text":"I like going to Joey's. Every time that I've been here whether it was for food or drinks, I've enjoyed my experience here. It's centrally located right by the Eaton Centre.

The Ahi Tuna Tacos was delicious. Ahi Tuna Tacos came with ginger coleslaw and wasabi aoli. The tuna was seared nicely. I really enjoyed the slaw and aoli.

I also tried the Lobster Grilled Cheese. This was yummy. I loved the oozing melted brie and cheddar cheese, and the bits of lobster.

The Mushroom Cheedar Burger was really good. The meat is moist and flavourful. The mushrooms and cheddar nicely complement the patty. The bun to meat ratio was spot on. I also enjoyed the house salad. It wasn't over dressed and the greens were fresh.

The place is usually busy every time that I have been there. If you are going on a Friday night or Saturday night and you have a big group, I would recommend making a reservation.

Because it's so busy on the weekend, they have front door host who takes care of the people waiting. I think this is an awesome idea! They give you some appetizers, and sometimes serve wine to the people waiting. The host was awesome she checked in on us, checked to see where we were on the waiting list, and was very friendly and personable. This is a great idea especially when you are waiting over 30 min or more."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great. It is lively and right in downtown Toronto. 

The food was good. With somethings being great and some being just okay.

The spinach and artichoke dip was great but the portion was really small compared to the price. 

I ordered the ribs with sweet potato fries. The fries were great and the ribs were tender but the bbq sauce was a bit tart. I didn't care for that too much.

Our waitress and the other staff there was very friendly."}
{"text":"Love the vibe at this place. Not too many vegetarian options but the veggie burger is a good choice! Very filling!!! Great service. The curry starter is also yum."}
{"text":"Best Lobster Grilled Cheese In town and refreshing Mojitos. Great service and I love the indoor/outdoor patio seating, great view of Toronto's busy downtown streets."}
{"text":"I have been there with a friend previously and had stellar food and service. We went back for my birthday dinner last night. We had the same server from before, Lauren who is fabulous! Unfortunately the kitchen was not on top of things last night and it was not the best food served. Hair in the Calmari then our steaks were not done as per ordered. Lauren sent them back and the Manager came over both very apologetic. The second steak was so so, one half was cooked properly and the second half was not. Again customer service excels there, they comp'd most of the bill. The apple tart dessert was a winner! I will go back again. 

Price vs. quality and quantity, about right."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch experience here!  The 3 of us were impressed with our meals and surprised at how great everything was.  The JOEY at Yorkdale was a let down the first time I went. In fact, chain restaurants like this usually leave me suspicious.  We were at Eaton's Centre and starving, looking for a place that could cater to all of our cravings.  We came in the door, there was no line: SOLD!

We had mojitos, they were delicious.  I had the lobster grilled cheese with a side salad.  My friends had a chicken sandwich and the BBQ salmon bowl.  We were all pleasantly surprised with the quality of our meals.  Then, I ordered a piece of key lime pie - also excellent and it was a massive piece.  Definitely worth the money.  I will be back again!  

JOEY surprised me -- thank you, JOEY for proving my snobbish view of you completely incorrect.  You delivered!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch at Joey this past Saturday afternoon. Just walking in the grand front doors, you feel the elegance of the place. We were lucky enough to secure a table by the opened garage-style windows that face Dundas Street. Comfortable couches, and a great view of all the people walking by on the sidewalk. The fresh lemonade was delicious and refreshing. My partner had the roast chicken and loved it. I had the Viva Salad, it was huge and fantastic. We would definitely go back, and for sure take visitors from out of town. It really is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"I was a bit unhappy that they did not have a brunch menu and to be honest the menu was rather limited but it was a really neat place, pretty, classy and yummy. My cousin enjoyed the young, cute waitresses so he was happy and I enjoyed the view and how amazingly downtown the place is, and frankly so well hidden. I think some sort of backyard patio would be incredible."}
{"text":"Great venue with a dancefloor all the way down stairs (unfortunately bathrooms are all the way down there as well but they do have an elevator). Good service and the food is good as well. Would definitely recommend if in the area but nothing to go out of your way for. Will return."}
{"text":"Love the design and atmosphere of this place. It's very upscale and the pricing is steep, so I wouldn't say this is at the top of my list as a go-to restaurant. But if the situation is right, this is practically perfect in every way. The service is good, the food is awesome and the drinks are many. Also has a very nice bar area, great for grabbing a couple drinks after dinner or work. 

Try the Lobster Ravioli or Lobster Grilled Cheese."}
{"text":"I came here with the family after watching the Santa Claus Parade on Sunday around 3PM for a very late lunch.  

We were greeted immediately and the hostess looked confused when she was deciding on where to seat us.  It shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes to look at a seating chart and to pick a free table (which there were many available) before bringing us to some table beneath the stairs.  - minus 1 star

Next we had the server bring our menus and asked what we would like for drinks, my husband ordered a lemonade and I ordered a hot tea.  After a few minutes, a different server arrives and drops down a ICED TEA and my hot tea.  He specifically ordered a lemonade and they bring an iced tea?  I'm sure the server just had hearing problems or was too dimwitted to comprehend the words that were coming out of our mouths.   - minus another star

At this point we decided to place our order, which included the Cheddar and Bacon burger with fries, a cream of mushroom soup and the Baja fish tacos.  The food arrived within 10 minutes - decent timing.   My biggest surprise was when the server brought the soup.  THERE WAS NO SOUP SPOON IN SIGHT!   We waited for our server to return, which was to no avail so we waved our hand frantically in the air to catch her attention, still nothing.  At this point, my husband was fuming mad so he stopped one of the servers and asked if he can get a spoon for my soup.  This male server had the audacity to say \"I'm busy, but I can get you a straw\"  Is that a joke?  Really?  Who drinks soup with a straw.  No one is laughing here!!!  This bimbo male server was outright rude and we were beyond livid at this point.  The male server than promptly came back to our table and dropped off a spoon while my husband had already marched off to the kitchen area of the restaurant to ask for a spoon. Maybe he realized his comment wasn't welcomed.  -  MINUS 100 STARS if it was possible!!!

Finally, after all this chaos and disruption we had a chance to taste the food.  The burger was mediocre and the fries that accompanied it were cold and soggy.  I will credit them for the Baja fish tacos which were quite tasty and the soup was nothing to rave about, but it did managed to cause much ruckus and therefore ruined our entire experience at this restaurant.  

Would I recommend this place to any sane minded person, probably not.  The service is horrible and was a complete waste of our time."}
{"text":"The Meals are really delicious but they don't have a wide variety of items to choose from. And this is for both the food and drink menu. You have your basics though from what you'd find at a regular sports bar or pub. 

The ambience is lovely and positive.

However, the service is below average if not bad. I was there last Sunday and it was just two staffs on the floor attending to people and this includes the the bartender and the waitress so the service was extremely slow. 

But the meals were superb, they just need to improve on their services and maybe add a few more items on their menus. (Both for food and drinks)"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great staff. My party and I felt very welcomed. I will return on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"The service here was SO SLOW..it took an HOUR for our food to arrive. We were seated in a booth that was almost unattended. Question - why seat us there if no one would ever check on us?

The food was great though  - I had Baja fish taco's and a glass of white wine. Also had some sushi.

The resto is huge and I saw a cool bar area, but tons of tvs.  I would consider this a dumbed down moxies.

I would return if I was shopping and hungry, but even then, there are way better selections around the Eaton Centre, and more value for price."}
{"text":"Came here with my family in the summer. We loved the ambience and the venue. The seating was nice and the service was great.

The downside was the serving size of the food. I tend to eat a lot so this place was horrible for me. I ordered the salmon bowl and the sushi taco. I wasn't even close to being full. My mom who has a much smaller appetite wasn't full from her meal either.

We all enjoyed our food, but we were all left wanting for more."}
{"text":"Joey's Eaton Centre has really down graded.
My first experience was amazing! Although I waited 2 hours, our server was pleasant and kind. She apologized about the wait times, and gave me and my boyfriend a little tour of the restaurant. She also placed us near the wine racks so we had a bit of privacy from the bar and larger groups. The chef also came out to meet us and offered complementary pumpkin spiced donuts.

Obviously, after the first experience I had to go back. The second time was terrible. I again waited 2 hours. We were placed in a table for 6 or 8 when it was just me and my partner. The drinks we received had a different presentation (No whipped cream, or sugar rimmed glass) from the first time, and it spilled on our table since our server was in a rush. Completely understandable though, since the restaurant is so busy. When the food came it was all right. I had the ramen, and my partner had the steak. Presentation was good, but the taste... meh. Definitely not worth the price. I spoke to the other people sitting around me and they felt the same way, picking at their food. 
After that night, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with my cousin for lunch. I've also been to this location a couple times before. Compared to all the other locations I've been to I can't give this one a four star. The service isn't as good as other locatiobs and the washrooms are 46 metres away with at least two flights of stairs, far from the dining area. The decor of the restaurant is almost identical to all the other Joeys I've been to. It's modern and sleek with touches of wood and silver. The bar area is very spacious with numerous televisions, which is good if you're there to have a couple of drinks. My cousin decided to go with the Baja Fish Tacos as I recommended since he hadn't been to as many Joeys as I have. He said that he enjoyed it and it tasted good. I decided to try something new and ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos. They were presented nicely and was not what I had expected but it tasted okay. I've had better dishes from here that I would choose over the Ahi Tuna Tacos. Overall, it was nice to catch up with my cousin but I think next time I'll stick to what I know and love, my Tandoori Chicken Flatbread."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and didn't have to wait to be seated, which was nice. But food was just mediocre for the price. 

Ordered the korean cauliflower - lots of breading and sauce which I didn't mind, cause it was seasoned really  well. But it looked so much like chicken that I was hoping for that chewy texture (which wasn't there).

For mains, we ordered the herb crush salmon, and the steak and sushi. The salmon dish was really good. It came with a spring roll and I couldn't figure out what the filling was. Whatever it was, it was delicious. The mashed potatoes were good too, and the salmon was cooked well. As for the steak and sushi, I wouldn't recommend it. The sushi rice was a bit soggy, and the steak slices were drenched in ponzu sauce (way too saltly). 

Overall, food was decent, but for the price I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Talkative/cute waitresses. Drinks are a little bit pricey but not too bad for location. I had the chicken burger and it was definitely up to par. They basically will customize all orders based on what you like, which I consider to be good."}
{"text":"My sister and I had a late lunch here today.....food was delicious as always. We had the ahi tuna club and fish tacos, alongside a couple of glasses of wine each. Our server was excellent! She was attentive and had a great sense of humour. The place was packed at 3:30pm.....a popular venue even during between regular meal times! This is definitely my favourite place to have lunch after shopping at Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. On this occasion I had the chicken fettuccine Alfredo which was delicious. 
I was very annoyed with our server. She kept coming over and interrupting our conversations for trivial reasons. Then when we finally did want to order she was nowhere to be found. 
I'm glad I made a reservation because it was very busy at lunch. 
I'll come back here because it's close to where my friends work. But if I ever have that server again I will definitely make sure I tell her how rude she is being."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to Joey's. And the second time was better than the first. We tried the secret option on the menu, the Mashed Potato Spring Rolls. The name might not be pleasing but the rolls were really good. The mashed potatoes were nice and creamy. We also tried the Chili Chicken which was amazing! We should have gone for seconds. As of dinner for the night I had BBQ Salmon Rice Bowl which was cooked properly as I had told them and tasted amazing. For dessert, make sure you try the Lava Cake. It was so delicious. Everything was perfect!!"}
{"text":"Perfect for lunch time! I love how they have an outdoor patio too.

I had the Ahi Tuna. The ahi tuna tacos are essentially bite sized tacos filled with a sesame and ginger coleslaw topped with a piece of perfectly seared ahi tuna served with a wasabi and lime aioli. I told the waitress to remove the wasabi since I'm not really a fan of wasabi. But even without the wasabi, it taste delicious! The tacos shells are made from a crispy fried wontons - which I've never taste anything like this before! They also had a sauce that went with the taco, I couldn't figure out what sauce it was. I believe it is a mix with avocado with mayo. 

I normally get the fish taco, which is often my staple go to food in every restaurant. But I thought I should try something that's different! I am so glad I did! The staff were very friendly, they often asked how I was and we were seated almost immediately without any wait at all. 

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"There was a bit of mix-up with the reservation where they told me the table was upstairs but in fact, our friends had already arrived at a table downstairs.  ...

I ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Salad.  It came with seared rare yellowfin tuna, mango, peanuts, avocado, crispy noodles, and a cilantro ginger dressing.  I was actually really impressed with how good this tasted.  It was a good portion.  What I loved most was how tender the nicely seared the tuna was.  I was impressed that a chain restaurant was able to serve up such a nice quality fish.  The cilantro ginger dressing was also very light and easy to mix with the rest of the veggies.  I didn't see any crispy noodles however.

There was an automatic 18% gratuity for parties with nine people or more which I thought was pricey."}
{"text":"Another passing 3 but not 4 yet
Call me old fashion. I like certain food you can only go to certain place to get. Ramen should go to Kenzo and butter chicken you go to Amaya. Combing all the options together, looks like it is global and urban style, but sorry I am not a big fan of this idea, especially when the Ramen is not as good as Kenzo and butter chicken served with brown rice. 

Other than my old fashion taste, Joey is a good place to sit down to have a drink or chat with your friends. Very nice inner deco, urban and trendy, love it. Food wise, saw friend ordered fish. she loves it. I ordered tandoori chicken flat bread, an Italian dish with an Indian twist, in a wrong way tho.

To me, there is a herb taste in the chicken or it was the BBQ sauce and the yogurt sauce just taste very random in the whole combination. 

Will definitely go again for friends gathering together. After all, all the food enjoyed with friends, are good food."}
{"text":"It really is hard not to give a five, and two nights in a row reassured me that it is worthy.

The food is amazing, the food filet the first night, blue cheese sirloin tonight, no scraps left over. They have a potato wrap that is very unique and something I'm going to try a replicate at home.

I'm seriously thinking the owner was affect by Robert Palmers  Addicted to Love video and you'll understand on your first visit.

Decadent Chocolate  with vanilla is very worthwhile. 

Say hi to Lisa and Nick for me, they will remember."}
{"text":"My lobster ravioli came with a 1 inch wood skewer bit that I almost died choking on...the server then tried to convince me that this was normal practice to keep the shrimp together (because we all know lots of restaurants that have 1 inch wood skewers)...just terrible."}
{"text":"Who's giving a chain restaurant 5 stars? This girl. I have been here countless times and I cannot stress enough how amazing the service here is. They truly go above and beyond and should be commended. Excellent customer service in Toronto is seriously lacking and Joey gets it right.

The food will tantalize your taste buds! I love the tandoori chicken flatbread, as it is sweet and savoury. The warm spinach dip is delicious and perfect for sharing. There really is something here for everyone.If you cannot decide which wine you prefer, you can sample a few before you choose.  

The loud, dark restaurant has two levels and is quite large. It's got a sexy vibe to it and you can watch the game on multiple screens. 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Another Vancouver culinary hit hits TOronto!

Came here and had a great seat on the outdoor patio this afternoon - and it reminded me of Vancouver in Toronto.  Let's talk food first!

We decided to share plate everything: CHILI CHICKEN, SHRIMP LETTUCE WRAPS, RAINBOW ROLL and the VIVA SALAD.  Made just like in Vancouver, it was A for presentation and quite refreshing in flavor!  I did find most dishes had an element of deep fried something - and that's where it lost a star for me.

The CHILI CHICKEN - deeps fried chicken bites glossed in sweet chili thai sauce over a bead of greasy chips.  The sauce makes the dish awesome and it's always been a fav of mine, even in Vancouver!

The LETTUCE WRAPS were a bit wee disappointing.  There were a lot of crunchy noodles and not a lot of shrimp or ingredients in it.  It was quite salty but tasted nice in the fresh crisp lettuce.

The RAINBOW ROLL - this is a new addition to their menu.  It was tasty and refreshing but it wasn't the best place to score a good roll.

The VIVA SALAD was great, refreshing, served on a bed of deep-fried case.  The ingredients didn't skimp - the chicken was good, it had cranberries, feta, avocado - on a yummy honey vingarette.  

Overall, the food was ok, same as Joey's food in Van.  The servers were all REALLY hot and the service was exceptional.  The servers were really attentive to details, our needs and getting everything right.  When we walked out, we were asked again on how the service was.  The ambiance definitely got points, the decor was very modern and clean.  The place is huge.  The bathroom is far away - it was intensely far, not good for the drunken people who need to stumble to the bathroom - people will be opening a few emergency door exits on their way for sure!

Overall - I got a good feeling in this resty.  Right near the corner of Yonge and Dundas - with their patio located on the first floor - you get full sight of the Toronto Crazies right at your table.  Great for drinks after work, lunch with friends, romantic dinner and will be a definite pick up spot for those single ladies and men!"}
{"text":"The service is good. The food is also great. Sushi and steak is a must try. Busy at lunch time so expect a little wait."}
{"text":"I've been to joeys several times and I must say that that quality of food is on point.
The atmosphere is quite modern and trendy.

I definitely recommend the Baja fish tacos! Wonderful taste! 
Also make sure you try the Indian flavour flatbread! Can't remember the exact name but it's the only Indian inspired one! Tons of great flavours! 

The service is usually good at this location, but if they are busy then the wait is usually really long 45 min plus."}
{"text":"Joey's for me is a great addition (not so new I know) to Dundas Square. Nicely set up, very open, and conducive to conversation both with your table and with the people around you.
I've ate at both tables and the main bar downstairs and have enjoyed both areas. Its easy to just walk up to the bar and squeeze in 2 friends usually unless you're at peak hours. Its me and my buddies go-to pregame spot if we want to make a big night of it. Very friendly and full of travellers and Toronto locals equally makes for good conversation.

For food they do Asian inspired dishes the best and i recommends the sushi cones or the ahi tuna club burger- very good. Drinks they make some niceeee Mojitos- which is rare in the centre of the universe.

p.s. there are bathrooms on the main floor .)"}
{"text":"So busy but a really fun ambiance with reliable dishes. We had the joeys featured wine (expensive) and got some mains. The salmon rice bowl was great, just a touch too salty. Less sauce would be better. Fish tacos were delicious as always! Would go back in the spring/summer when the patio is open."}
{"text":"We dropped by for a pre shopping lunch. I've always liked their tuna so we ordered the tuna rack to share. The shell was a deep friend wonton shell with Asian flavors any cubes of tuna. It was a very good Asian app for a western restaurant. 

Also ordered the blue cheese steak, it was just okay. What enjoyed about the dish is the mashed potato. It was served inside a crispy spring roll. Definitely a unique way to have mashed potatoes"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, I was pretty impressed. The food was very good, although lacking in what I felt was a diverse menu, and the service was excellent. I have never been to a restaurant where they asked me multiple times, how was the service! THREE TIMES (twice at the table, and once as we were leaving). And the service was very good. 

The place is big, Two floors. Wooden tables, and accents gave it character. This place is so big I cannot understand why the toilets are so far away. BE WARNED. You need a GPS to go there, and go early before you get too intoxicated to wander the stairwell. There are at least signs that guide you and acknowledge the far away toilets, but WHYYYYY?

We sat near the bar area in a very nice booth. On a Wednesday night, the place was full of corporates that just finished work. Just a general observation, but might be a nice place for a single girl to hang out and meet someone, just saying. 

The menu is fusion. I'm never a fan of fusion, anything Asian while I'm not in an asian restaurant - so once I rule that out, there's only a few things left on the menu. It's your usual, Milestones type restaurant dishes, but I suspect they take it up a notch. In a previous location, I did have the Lobster Grilled Cheese, so I will attest to that being amazing. 
If you're vegetarian, it didn't seem like there was much choice, but they do offer a gluten free and vegetarian menu - ask your server. How nice.

I got the Ahi Tuna Tacos ($12) the first item on the appetizer menu, all for myself. Note: this is not a first date meal. I made a mess of myself. Small corn crispy tortillas with stuffs inside, topped with a seared piece of tuna, with a side of sesame cilantro sauce - there was no way I could take all that in one bite. 

We got a side of Yam Fries ($9) it wasn't that substantial, but shared with 3 people it was ok. Very salty, topped with shaved cheese and side of aioli.

My girlfriend got the crispy noodle salad with lettuce wrap. It was basically a stirfry noodes with salad you can make your own tacos with. Nothing new for Chinese cuisine, but she says it was very tasty. (Also on the appetizer menu)

They have happy hours too! Today a wine (usually $8/glass) was $6/glass and bottle was $24 instead of $36.

Our service. Yes, it was very good. Our waitress who looked like a young Lindsay Lohan pre botox had a really enthusiastic attitude, and had the patience to come to us multiple times and ask us for our drinks, meal and dessert bc we weren't ready. She also took us on a \"menu tour\" of their popular dishes and she knows the menu by memory, something that I don't see often. They are all obviously well trained, which is nice to see. 
She did on occasion forget to get us water we asked for, (2x) but once she realized, she was right on it. 

Yah! I would come back. I don't like chains, but this one I might come back.  Given the choice of restos in the area, this is probably one of the better ones. 

Oh, and it SEEMS like (don't know for sure) if you're waiting in line, there is a bottle of white chilling in the waiting area with empty glasses. Hmmmmm..."}
{"text":"Upscale bar like atmosphere. Tried the sliders, may have had a bit too much salt on the beef, but was very fresh. The mashed potato stuffed spring roll was recommended as a side and was well worth it. 

I had the butter chicken and while it was decent, it doesn't hold up to butter chicken dishes from Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"I went there twice and both times I had a really good experience. They were both just nice outings with family or friends where nothing went wrong, like they do at some restaurants.

Here's what I tried:
1. Summer sangria: 9/10. I loved it and would definitely get it again. 
2. Real peach Bellini: 6/10. This was ok. Not my favorite.
3. Calamari: 8/10. Everyone loved this one!
4. California chicken sandwich: 8/10. This was pretty good. I upgraded the fries to yam fries with the mayo sauce, which was really good but not the best that I have tried."}
{"text":"We've been here several times since it's conveniently located right by the Eaton Centre. The place is always fairly busy, but has many tables and seats, so the wait tends to be reasonable usually! On a Friday evening, we waited about 10 minutes for a table for two.

I have ordered the butcher's sandwich, California chicken sandwich, chicken parm, and rotisserie chicken sandwich so far. My favourite would definitely have to be the butcher's sandwich because of the generous portion of tasty roast beef. The California chicken was not bad, but I preferred both the chicken parm and rotisserie chicken sandwich more. One thing is the food quality isn't consistent - on some visits, the food is fantastic, and on other visits, the fries or sandwich have come out cold, for example.

Either way, I'd still come back because of the convenient location and relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It was my idea of a get-away from the mall food court. Although the food court now at Eaton Centre is killer. My gf, her friend and I wanted somewhere new to try in the Yonge/Dundas area. Astors, Milestones, Barrel, Brewers, Paramount, have all been done.

Joey's was a whole new vibe. One that we all liked. While we waited, we browsed the shopping mall for gifts. They called us when the table was ready, none of that sitting and waiting bs. 

Once seated, our waitress was super friendly. When ordering however, watch out for the sneaky add-ons. \"So sweet potato fries are OK, right?\" or \"Garlic bread is OK with that?\". Sounded like they came with the dish but actually you have to pay extra for either option. They're smooth talkers and sleazy salesmen here. It's a skill I need to learn...

While waiting for our food, we basked in the ambiance. It's a modern, intimate yet friendly and semi-casual restaurant. I just threw out a bunch of adjectives but they are all applicable. You can dress up or dress down without feeling or looking like an idiot. 

Our food arrives, nicely presented. I ordered the shrimp tacos, served in a trio and delicious. The tortilla was dry stiffer than preferred but the overall dish was good. My gf had the lobster ravioli because she's a millionaire. It was rich and full of seafood flavour, almost like a bisque as a sauce. Her friend had the lobster grilled cheese because he too, was a millionaire. It was super fatty, felt like 2 pounds per bite. Very good, some lobster pieces inside but of course, not many.

Sapporo Beer was $5 a pint that day.

The take away: it's better than most chains around the area. It's more upscale and the food is priced very closely to those around too. The number of choices are astounding. From East to West, there is certainly a taste for you here."}
{"text":"First time I had been to Joeys Eaton Centre, and was completely thrilled with my experience. 
Great atmosphere, terrific food and service was also very good! 
I have also heard great things about the other Joeys locations. 
I plan on going back very soon!"}
{"text":"The sashimi salad here is so delicious and interestingly refreshing. I still haven't found anything similar in Toronto. If you're having having a rough day, their molten lava cake and a glass of red wine will do the trick!!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this was close to the best, if not the best, dining experience I've had. We were greeted by lovely host staff to take us to our seat on the patio facing Dundas. The tables are large and roomy, everything is comfortable to sit on. All the staff got to know us on a first name basis which was an unexpected surprise. Our server also took a seat with us at the table which was really cool, we felt like he was our buddy which made our dining experience more comfortable and open. We got the elderflower cocktail, Ceasar, a Martini and a passion fruit Margarita which were all absolutely stunning and tasted phenomenal. I got the mushroom swiss burger and my boyfriend got the vegetarian burger. Both extremely delicious and I will admit, I honestly think the vegetarian burger tasted even better than my own. Finally, we got the apple pie dessert with maple ice cream and I wanted to cry from how delicious it was. Fresh and warm pie with warm apples and crispy crust, and some cold ice cream to compliment it. Just a masterpiece. The environment was low lit and extremely relaxed on a Sunday night. Music was really great!!! Everything just came together to provide for a wonderful dining experience. Thanks Kyle and Brandon for serving us, we had an amazing time!! Will definitely be back for late night dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. I came here for lunch with a few friends. We all got burgers or sandwiches. I got the California chicken burger with fries. The chicken was juicy and ask the components worked well together. I thought the cheese was a but oily. The fries were alright. They tasted very much like McDonald's fries but with less salt. My friend got a hand pressed cheese burger and it was quite massive and a bit drippy with oil. Nevertheless, she still enjoyed it. My other friend got the ahi tuna sandwich. She had no comments about hers."}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and we were impressed by the lively atmosphere and attentive service. We had the pan-roasted mushroom pasta and the California chicken sandwich. The pasta had a lot going on, but it was still rather simple so the ingredients had nothing to hide behind - it was simple, but done well. My only complaint was that the garlic cream sauce was a tad salty and the bacon was out of place on the dish. I also feel like it was missing a more substantial protein, but for that price it's expected. The California chicken sandwich was enjoyable, but my companion would have enjoyed it more if it were baked.

We stayed for happy hour, and must I say, JOEY has a well thought out happy hour menu. It is more than worth the price and the definitely don't skimp out.  We had few sangria's and the muskoka lager. The sangria was made very well and the amount of alcohol was very generous and not watered down at all.  Lastly, we found it funny that the washroom was so far away, and they even had signs coaching you through finding the place.  After a few trips however, our server let us know that there is a washroom on the main floor and the downstairs one is kind of an initiation thing for first timers!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food with a very cool upbeat vibe.  A must have is their house made ice cream.  Each time I've been there the staff has been friendly.  The drinks are above average with seating options of bar side or high top table seating for drinks. Great for large groups (kinda backroom downstairs) overflow area.  Even if you don't have to use the bathroom ask where it is located and just go.  The journey to the John is worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and food in the Dundas Square area - try the Sushi Cones. - and they have free wifi!  This place has a very good supper menu.  I usually start with the Sushi Cones then the Salmon.  Lively place most nights of the week with a lot of pretty women, both the waitress and clients!  Nice big rectangular shaped bar, perfect if you are eating alone and want to have supper and watch a sports game or two."}
{"text":"Very trendy restaurant. Beautiful staff(I mean all the ladies look like they sideline as models)!!
I had the most amazing salad in my life here...Sashimi Tuna
(seared rare Ahi, mango, peanuts, avocado, crispy noodles, cilantro ginger dressing). So good...can't explain the taste. You just have to try it!!!! It's $18 which for a salad is kinda high in price, but one can splurge on themselves every now and again. Very classy place!!!"}
{"text":"Great decor. Decent food. Friendly (very good looking) wait staff. Fast service. 
Joey is trendy, it wants to be trendy, it is obviously trying  very hard to be a cool spot to eat, drink and socialize. It succeeds because it is still relatively new to Toronto, hires beautiful staff, serves decent food in big portions made with good ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, and this place is an AVERAGE steakhouse, with the price of HIGH. I didn't care for the service, it was busy, and we barely got our food / drinks in a timely manner. Also, my food came out cold and I had to give it back, I would not go here again, but I would sit at the bar, the location is great!"}
{"text":"- Tasty dessert
- Music so loud I wanted to cut my ears off.
- Service so slow I'm not sure if anyone would have notices my newly lacking ears.

Sat outside to get away from the banging tunes.  It was pretty late at night, no real excuse for slow service other than the workers were constantly huddled together instead of working."}
{"text":"Joey has once again impressed me like no other restaurant has, despite the fact that my chicken wasn't thoroughly cooked. The tenderness was perfect, and the spice level was just right. The fries were a near miss this time around though. Diane, our waitress was amazing. Her level of service and professionalism is a testimony to the level of service expected at a Joey restaurant. There ware some improvements that would be beneficial to this particular restaurant such as improving the bathroom design and remodelling the last seats close to the bathrooms. It is not the best experience to hear people flushing. Moreover, a sink smaller than my hand is not the most efficient system there is. I am comparing the level of the Eaton Centre to the one at Eau Claire."}
{"text":"I used to go here every Thursday with some friends. now that I live uptown, I try to make appearances but not as frequent. classy establishment with great, friendly service."}
{"text":"I love this location. It's conveniently located next to the Eaton centre and is a large location. It tends to get super busy especially later during the week and the wait times tend to get really long so it's wise to make reservations well in advance to avoid waiting an hour to get a seat. 

The fettuccine Alfredo is so good! The artichoke dip as an appetizer is a must try--so creamy and so tasty.

The service is better if you go earlier on in the week, because, like I said, the busier it gets the slower the service is and the longer the wait times are."}
{"text":"The blue cheese steak was perfectly cooked, and the molten lava cake was heavenly. Easily 5/5 and will come back again."}
{"text":"Best dining experience in a long time. The moment we walked into Joey Eaton Centre we were treated like VIPs. Waiting in the beautiful lobby for a table we were offered wine tasting, Bellini tasting and flatbread! It was very memorable. All the Girls looked beautiful and the outfits very professional and classy. Loved the grey dresses. We were going to a play after dinner and the girls were super accommodating getting our drinks and food to us so fast! We shared the Lettuce Wraps and the Mezze Plate, both were fabulous. You are very lucky to have staff like Jamila at the front, she left a lasting impression and we will definitely  be coming back to say hi! Our server Kathleen was also wonderful, she was very friendly and super efficient. Between the great service, beautiful decor and classy but casual atmosphere, we will be coming back ever time we are in the City!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Joey
Mostly the Markville location me and my wife frequent

So I think that the usual service at one location I would get would be the same

Was I ever wrong

First.....
We got one server that came to our table
Took our drinks etc.

My wife ordered a diet coke but it literally was carbonated water

Our server disappeared for quite some time but eventually came back.....ordered another but the same results.....then we were told the machine dispenser was acting up.....so then my wife asked for a Sprite only to have one of the managers come back with another watered down diet coke....eventually though the sprite came that thankfully wasn't watered down

Went to order apps.....ordered the Tandoori chicken flatbread.....only to have the bread come out burnt!?!?!?

Couldn't believe what I was seeing .....they would come out with another

My wife ordered the Farmers Chicken Salad but that too was disappointing because the chicken was undercooked

Follow that up with the fact that it took another 20 minutes for the bill to come

We were part of a big group and several others in our party had complaints as well

We got our gratuity down from 20 to 15 percent and the app was comped.....yet they still charged my wife for two drinks.....wasn't going to kick up a stink for 3.25 cuz at that point I was fed up

Not too mention when I went to the washroom there it was disgusting.....don't want to mention the condition of the stalls in fear it may make you lose your appetite

I had a previous mediocre experience at Joey at the Shops at Don Mills back in January with regards to undercooked food

This experience took the cake

Sadly this will likely make me not attend a Joey for quite some time"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of a well cooked chicken sandwich, which seems deceptively hard from what I have seen... They have a great one, and an enjoyable wine list with local choices by the glass. That is all I ask for. Add to it good service -- friendly but not overbearing; and that is about perfect!"}
{"text":"Horrible, ignorant experience. I've work in the service industry for a very long time and am pretty relaxed when I'm out dining. First off, the food was horrible, especially for the price. I ordered the blacken salmon c. Salad. My lettuce was soggy and way over dressed, the salmon was undercooked it was gummy on the inside to the point where I couldn't even cut it open with a fork also it was cold. Not blackened. Towards the end our server asked if we were going to a \"reggae club\"  after dinner because we were all black, which made everyone very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, large menu, great atmosphere, and unbeatable location! This is the Eaton Centre location, but it's not exactly attached to the Eaton Centre. You will have to exit either at H&M or Best Buy and Joey's is a few steps away. In the summer, it's a beautiful place to get food and drinks on their \"patio\", which is essentially their tables by the windows, except the windows aren't there. I came here TWICE yesterday - once for lunch and once during happy hour. I'll detail both experiences below:

I came for lunch with a group of 6. They don't allow reservations for lunch hour, but we didn't have to wait for a table anyways. We were seated upstairs in a booth, and our waiter brought us water right away. I ordered the California chicken burger with fries for $16. Food didn't take long to arrive, and it I appreciated that they brought out all 6 dishes at once, unlike other similar restaurant chains (*cough* Milestones *cough*). The fries were a little salty, but I still thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Our waiter was amazing (I think his name was Joe, but I'm not 100% sure). He asked us if everything was good with our food twice and at the end of our meal, he played some trivia games with us. If any one of us got the answer right, he said he would pay for our pop (we didn't get either of the 2 trivia questions right).

A few hours later, I came back for happy hour. We had a group of 8 or 9, but they didn't have any tables big enough to accommodate us so we just kept adding chairs to the booth. Despite such a large group and some people not actually drinking (like me), our waitress, Rachel, was very sweet and brought drinks quickly. Happy hour also includes food so there's something for everyone!

Overall, food and service is great, but this place is definitely on the pricier side. For around $20 per entree, I would expect bigger portions. Location is very convenient, especially since my school is right next door, so Ill definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not great for a 50 minute wait.  Menu had some really good aps. The fried chicken chile ap was really good.  The walk to the wash room is the true treat. During the three flights of steps to the sub basement you might find big foot and the Loch Ness monster.  If you have a few beers during your wait for the table keep this in mind and leave extra time so you don't mess your pants"}
{"text":"My family loved Joey Eaton Center.  We were visiting Toronto from the US, and this was one of our favorite restaurants.  The food and the service were both excellent.  We thought the prices were reasonable for the quality.  Each of us ordered a different dish, and all of them were very flavorful and prepared perfectly.  Our only complaint was that it was pretty loud.  It was difficult for our group of four to talk at our table because of the music level.   We will definitely come back on our next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"I usually always get the same stuff, Beef dip, chicken sandwhich or any type of burger. 

Joey definitely has that 'chain' restaurant feel but it's better then most in the area in terms of food and ambiance. 

Just word of warning the washroom is far, I think 40 something meters which is actually posted on a sign as you make your journey. 

One thing I do like is the daily drink deals, they're actual drinks you would want to drink as opposed to some obscure bait and switch type of drink deal. 

Staff are friendly but others mentioned they will try to upsell you so don't be afraid to double check. As well 'specials' are not any cheaper,"}
{"text":"Still surprisingly impressed. 

Stepped in for a n early dinner quick bite and managed to get the last 2 seats at the bar. It was busy. 

Waitresses were super friendly and seconded my interest in the spanish lobster broth  paella. The main took a while to serve but it was worth it! For $24 it looked small, but in the end was enough to fill my tummy. The taste and seasoning was incredible, decent amount of shrimp but paper thin chorizo. I loved how they cooked it so there was just enough cripsy rice at the bottom of the skillet.  

Will definitely order that again!"}
{"text":"I love a good veggie burger and swift service! I'n not sure what some of the reviewers were expecting as this is a polished sports bar so to speak. Anywho, the server from Buffalo with glasses and short brown hair is very friendly. Pity, I forgot his name or I would request him again. :("}
{"text":"I wanted to hate this place. It reminds me of places like Moxies that I actually do hate. 
But all in all I actually enjoyed it. Decent beer menu on tap including Shocktop (a summertime staple) and Muskoka Breweries Mad Tom IPA in addition to the major brands you'd expect. We had a couple of the meat and cheese charcuterie plates, and while enjoyable it was actually the bread that accompanied it that almost stole the show. Tasty stuff. Then as a main I had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which was also quite good. I'm not sure if really stands out as a $16 chicken sandwich, but it did indeed hit the spot nicely. 

Given I can't really come up with a single complaint with genuine merit, (even the service was on point), 4 stars it is."}
{"text":"It's pretty good.  More upscale than many of the other restaurants in the area.  Always very busy.  This was my 3rd attempt to eat there and we would always give up because the wait was too long.  Had a burger.  

The bathrooms are quite a hike!

I would go back if the wait is not too long."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of joey's, ever since they came to Toronto, I will never say no if you ask me to go. They're fancy but not crazy. This one is right by the eatons so it's bound to be busy..and they don't take resos on friday lunch hours so we were super praying that it'd be okay - turns out, if you go 15min before 12pm, you'll for sure secure a seat. We got a super comfy booth and actually a glass of complimentary champagne as we came in! Fridaze, am I right?! 

Emily, our server was a gem. She took care of us so well and made the effort to get our names out of courtesy, not because she was required to. She was so sweet and even brought us mini bellinis on the house, which made us realize how great they tasted and we ended up getting actual drinks. I had the vegan burger, which was u n r e a l. I've never tasted a veggie burger made of so many things! It even had almonds grinded up in it. Oh my gah, it was sooo delicious. And it came with a heaping amount of fries. Did I mention, joey's fries are the bomb dot com? They taste like a less salty version of mcd's fries and they're a bit softer on the inside, which is my fave kind of fry. Shoestring fries can marry me right now.

Joey's is always a good choice for a date, a business lunch or any occasion in general. It's fancy without being snobby or TOO overpriced. I'd say it's worth the treat once in awhile."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Server was helpful and attentive. Service was fast. It was a full house but only waited for 5mins to be seated without reservation. There's live DJ on a Friday night"}
{"text":"Get the Ahi Tuna Club Sandwich. I've never had anything like it! Been back 3 times for it specifically.  Most recently also had the lettuce wraps which were really refreshing and a good size."}
{"text":"If you're near Yonge and Dundas and want a safe yet great option, Joey's is it. There's such a great menu here with classics and other new items with refreshing twists. 

The atmosphere was lively, there's a lot of chatter going around and the waiters were even dancing with the music. It all adds to the casual yet fun experience, it might be a bit too loud for some but that's to be expected. 

We went with a calamari appetizer to start which was plentiful and delicious. They were lightly breaded (with a crunch) and were quite tender. I really enjoyed the added tempura vegetables even though there wasn't too much of them. They were drizzled with a nice creamy garlicy aioli and there was extra dipping sauce. 

We had a tuna night going with their yellowfin tuna salad and ahi tuna club. The salad was a nice 'asian' inspired slaw and the vinaigrette was sweet, tangy with a bit of spice in there. There was nice textures coming from the crunchy peanuts and the crunchy noodles and tuna itself was seared well. There was a nice crust on it. Mango slices provided a soothing cooling with its sweetness. The tuna club was delightful. The brioche bun added a nice satisfying chew to the sandwich and the  tuna was very meaty in a good way. The sweet pepper relish really brought together the club and the smokiness of the bacon really elevated the flavors.

To finish the wonderful meal, go with the molten chocolate cake. It was gooey on the inside and not overly baked at all. The outside still had a nice firmness without being overly cooked. It was not overly sweet and has all that dark chocolate goodness.  Vanilla ice cream was also served which added an extra richness to the cake."}
{"text":"Sold food and service from one of the better chains in the GTA.

I've only been here twice, but both times were for bigger group events. JOEY is clearly accustomed to handling larger groups, because they handled both of my visits smoothly. I'd definitely recommend this place for bigger outings where a smaller non-chain restaurant just isn't viable.

On to the food - I'd have to say I'm quite pleased. I've had the ahi tuna club, lobster grilled cheese, and the seafood paella. All three were quite good, although I wasn't much of a fan of the lobster grilled cheese (or grilled cheese in general). The ahi tuna club was one of the best I've had, though. I haven't had authentic paella before so I can't comment on it with any technical knowledge, but I was a big fan of the crispness of the rice at the bottom of the dish. It really added a nice texture to the dish overall. The seafood and meat in the dish were also prepared well enough."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow!! My husband and I stopped in as a last minute thing before heading home. The food was good -- worth the money. We were driving home, and I got so hungry and since we didn't know the area, we stopped at the first place we saw.

The service was amazing! Thank you so much to our waitress, Alexandra! She noticed that we weren't local and asked us where we were from, how we liked our trip so far, and made some great recommendations for places to see before we head home.

Alexandra was so patient and kind while we picked what we wanted to eat. I'm not usually a picky eater, but I had a craving for Sangria. (I just wasn't sure if this place was up to par.) Alexandra assured me that I'm making the right decision. My husband stuck to water (boo!). I asked for the calamari, and my husband ordered their hand pressed burger and fries. I definitely loved picking at his fries. The food was good, but the customer service was beyond wonderful. It was so nice of our waitress to take an interest and make recommendations. BTW - she's absolutely beautiful, inside and out."}
{"text":"Way better than expected.  I've been here a few times, and the fact that I keep going back is always a good sign.

Always seated without too long a wait, servers are quite nice and extremely accommodating.

Last time I visited this place, I was with one of my friends and we'd just seen a movie at Yonge/Dundas and were a little peckish.  So we hit up Joey's.

We were seated immediately and a our drink orders were taken in short order.  Though the server looked shocked when we ordered club soda with lime.  While we waited for or drink order one of the tables near the open windows became available and we asked to be moved.  The easily accommodated our request.

Our food order arrived quickly and both were great.  I had fish and my friend had steak.  Food was tasty and cooked to perfection.  We both asked for modifications to our orders and the kitchen was accommodating.

All in all a good experience.  My only issues with the place are the menu - way too many items, and the long ass haul to the bathrooms...seriously, it's a bit of a trek."}
{"text":"very meh, the artichoke dip was oily and justttt ok. The tuna tacos were also just ok, nothing special and the tuna wasn't very flavorful. Upside is that it's a pretty good option in this area for a sit down restaurant and they have a $5 beer special."}
{"text":"Hands down the WORST service I received ever from the Joeys franchise!! Boring atmosphere! Such an unpleasant, ignorant server, just throw my plate in front of me like she was feeding an animal!! I asked for a sauce and by the time they brought it, my food was already in my tummy!! This franchise going downhill!! The food was nothing special in fact felt like a microwave frozen style food!! The meat was cold and still half frozen! Not worth a cent!! Very very unprofessional staff!! Just throw 50 bucks down the toilet, don't waste ur money and stay away from this location! There are lot of better places u could go in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Don't eat the steak dinner with the sour baby potatoes. Not sure if it was that or the very vinegary salad or the weird pudding type of dessert, but I'm laying in bed with food poisoning. Fever, chills, diarrhea (sorry), and severe abdominal pain and bloating. It feels like I'm giving birth and having contractions, let's put it that way.

Happy holidays to me. I'll never be going back."}
{"text":"For the price it's at, you'd expect a higher class meal with better service! There were 3 of us, and we ordered a gyoza and tuna taco to share to start with some glasses of wine.  It was nice to be able to taste a couple to choose which we actually wanted a 9 oz. of.  Both appetizers were decent, nothing special but good. Then we get to our main courses - burger, sirloin steak, and sushi and steak.  The burger was very good.  Sirloin steak nothing special.  The sushi and steak - steak was way way too salty in the sauce. Sushi was ok, again nothing special.  Then we chose the apple pie and chocolate molten cake for dessert.  The molten cake was cold, our server told us it was because it was on the same plate as the cold ice cream.  Lol, ok - get your food facts straight before you open your mouth.

All in all, the food was nothing special, just expensive for the quality.  However, it would have been ok if the service was better.  We did not sit at the bar, was in the dining area, yet our server would just toss down 3 plates and 3 sets of utensils at our table instead of placing in front of each of us.  Then gave us 2 dirty plates we had to switch out.  Then, didn't stop back to check in with us, so it was hard to even ask for more water or ketchup.  Find a cheaper bar, or better restaurant."}
{"text":"Here we are. I came alone to Joey tonight on 16th Feb (and I come twice every weeks AT LEAST...) and I had a long bad day, the team took good care of me as usual BUT the manager offered an unexpected extra dessert for me. That is the thing, I go and went to the most expensive or notorious places in Toronto downtown, but most of those fancy places (even the ones with a waiting list) are not even close to the customer service I can get at Joey.
Thank you Brandon (one of the manager I think) for being considerate towards his clientele. This is what I called \" Customer Service \". 
This is exceptional, professional but this is an experience that I won't forget. Myself as a manager, this is what I expect from places where I go several time a week, even the ones more expensive than Joey !
Every time I come here I am happy with the service, the staff, the service, the food, the atmosphere, I'm satisfied. So again, my advice to other places in Toronto, you should learn from Joey. 
Thank you, 5 stars well deserved, good job guys"}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. I've been to a location in Ottawa as well and was satisfied."}
{"text":"Went here during a snowstorm. Server was friendly and knowledgable. Food was good. Their speciality cocktails were amazing!!"}
{"text":"I've come for dinner twice now and the service was a wildly inconsistent between the two times, which is why I docked a star. Otherwise, the food quality, atmosphere, environment and general experience both times were simply wonderful. Their menu is all online and I would always suggest you make a reservation just to be on the safe side. They are almost always full and super busy on Friday and Saturday evenings though. They're also super accommodating, with accessibilities and any food allergies or dietary restrictions, so be sure to let your server/hostess know when you get there. Food is delicious, and the highlights for me were the Ahi Tuna Tacos and the mashed potatoes that come with the steak. Instead of giving you a lump of mashed potatoes and sour cream/bacon/cheddar cheese, they have the mashed potatoes inside a crunchy spring roll, which just makes the whole thing a ton more enjoyable. 

They have some pretty sweet $3.5 appies from 3-6pm so be sure to ask about those! This Joey's is just outside of Eaton Centre, right across from Muji. Well worth a visit for drink, appies or a nice dinner."}
{"text":"We began Saturday night near Yonge and Dundas, and decided to hit Joeys!
First off, you cannot miss the front door! its like opening a time capsule vault! damn!! This place is definitely happening, and a great destination after some retail therapy at Eaton Center.  

For Drinks, She had the Blueberry MOJITO, 5/5 with your typical taste of a mojito with a twist of blueberry is perfecto for any summer night.  I on the other hand rather than my usual Vino, it was to try their house made Sangria!! 4.5/5, the fruits were perfected  fermented with the alcohol, and I was glad that it wasn't watered down at all!

For Food:
=Pesto Shrimp on flatbread: 4/5 would have been perfect, however It was a bit TOO oily.  After all I could feel it sticking to my ribs.  Perfect balance of flavor with the pesto, and portion of shrimp that was on the flatbread which was cut much like a small version party sized pizza.  The extra drizzle of FRESH oregano added more versatility to the dish. 

=Calamari Fritto:
This was great which complimented our drinks, not too oily, and perfect balance as the it was more seafood rather than more batter/tempura.  The spicy aioli which added some diversification to the food, nonetheless it added balance to our culinary experience here.

Overall, great place to go for drinks after work, or out in and around the downtown core, the service is great, two floors of contemporary design, lots of tvs, full our bar and a lot of choice for foods.  Their prices are somewhat reasonable, however you're in the city, so be prepped."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening with my friends and it was pretty busy, but it only took a few minutes to get a table.

The waitress was very attentive and made sure we didn't have to wait too long to get our order taken. She was friendly and even had a little conversation with us as we were getting ready to leave.

I ordered the BBQ Salmon Rice Bowl ($16.50) and I thought it was good. But then again, when is Salmon ever not good? The sauce made it very flavourful so I mixed everything together to make a mixed bowl of yumminess. 
I don't eat that much, but my other friends who ordered the same thing said they weren't satisfied with the amount of food that was on their plate. I agree that it was pretty pricey for the amount of food we got.

Overall I'd rate my experience a 3.5/5. Food was good but overpriced."}
{"text":"I would have given a better review if they didnt overcook my steak and take a very long time to bring the correct one afterwards.

besides that i really like the design and ambience, the food is good, the wine is good and I like the crowd as well. weather you're going for drinks, food or both you'll have a good time with your friends and there serve a lot of great appetizers. 

I ordered the steak medium rare, first time around they brought it medium well. I told the server and she had another made for me, but it tool so long (above average time) for the new steak too arrive, and they still charged me for it as well. :)

but everyone else seemed very happy"}
{"text":"Our group of 5 came late for dinner without reservations and was seated before 10pm. Ordered some hot water to warm up from the cold and the waitress splashed hot water everywhere while putting down the cups. We let that go as she was super apologetic and nothing was damaged.  We enjoyed the ambience with our wine before our food came...

Unfortunately, 4/5 orders (steak frites x2, bbq salmon with rice, and butter chicken) were served to us cold or room temperature. This was embarrassing as a host for our guest visitor from Hong Kong. The manager came to deal with the situation and they quickly took our food to be reheated/replaced. 

The venue was busy and we could definitely see the waitress running around like mad serving customers, but it is just disappointing to have this happen at such a late time.

The food in general was good, but it was a long and tiring dinner... Just ate quickly and left to go home before 12am."}
{"text":"Was only there for a beer. But it had a nice ambience and the servers were extremely nice. They also have a very big collection of beers, wines, and other spirits, including some good single-malts."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend during Boxing Day for lunch as we were taking a break between shopping. Actually, as she was taking a break between shopping while I was holding all of her bags. There were not a lot of people inside so we got a table pretty quickly. The restaurant is really really big. They have a nice big central bar with seats upstairs as well. Bathrooms are downstairs and are about 0.5 km from the stairs. It is really long to get to the bathrooms. They actually have signs that tell you how far you are from the bathroom. Not sure why they needed to put the bathrooms so far from the restaurant.  Anyways, when we were seated, we got our menus and waited about 20 minutes before the waitress even showed up to get our drinks. 20 minutes!!!! And the restaurant wasn't even close to being full. And they were definitely not understaffed either because there were a lot of servers standing around idle. We even tried to flag down a waitress but were coldly ignored. I would have given them 1 stars but the food was actually decent that I couldn't give them 1 star. However, service-wise, 1 star. Food. 3 stars. Averages out to about 2 stars as service and quality of food are my top priorities followed (not closely) by decor. I've eaten in not so good looking restaurants with top notch food so that isn't highly considered in my ratings."}
{"text":"I used to work across the street and wondered what this place would be like, no more wondering, its fantastic! 

Twice I've been impressed with the level of service, attention to details and the quality of the food and drink.

For starters, the sampler beer or wine at the door while we wait for our table is really the best way to start any dinner. Then the drinks, anything with slush and Jack Daniels is my new fave! Also discovered a lovely white wine that I will definitely get again. The waitress was even nice enough to find out if I can buy the wine at the LCBO (bonus, I can!)

Then there is the delicious food. I've been here twice and both times I ordered a salad and each time had a special request and they were more than accommodating. The first time a friend and I planned on splitting the salad, and they did it for us, which was very helpful. 

Second time my chicken looked a bit pinky for my taste (the chicken was so juicy, but I was still cautious). The waitress noticed and immediately offered to redo it for me. She brought over the rest of the salad to eat while I waited for my chicken, and it was perfect the 2nd time around! The manager even came to check up on me which was a nice gesture.

The Salads themselves are quite awesome, and I'm not a huge herbivore! The Lemon-Caper dressing on the Ceaser was so good that I joked I wanted to wear it as a face mask!

While it is a bit pricier, its worth it just for the high quality of service and food you get. 

High recommend for girls night, dates or just to get away from the touristy hustle and bustle of Yonge and Dundas!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were just looking for somewhere nice to eat for dinner.  We decided to check out JOEY at eaton centre since we frequently pass by the place and never really got around to check it out.  As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, my girlfriend and I were greeted and seated to our table.  The waitress that was serving us was real polite and nice.  Our food came in the order we wanted (appetizer, main and desert) since most restaurant usually give the appetizer and main at the same time.  The truffle fries were amazing and so did the steak we've ordered.  I would definitely come back to JOEY at eaton centre.  Great first experience.  I really recommend it."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Marriott nearby for an extended period of time and Joeys was always my go to. The staff are kind and always great with me.  The menu is diverse and I can say I never tried something I did not like.  I even ended up hosting a corporate event for 30 people which they handled really well. Overall this place has everything whether for work, casual, take out or even just to stop for a drink during a big sports game"}
{"text":"We came here for paint night and the venue was fabulous! The bartender downstairs wrongly charged us twice for our drinks and failed to mention the auto grat. Our group would have gladly tipped her more but she was rather snippy about the whole situation so we decided she didnt deserve more. 

Moving on to our dining experience upstairs, we had the chicken wings (really small wings but good price for how many you receive) and various burgers (great fries and like server said the veg burger actually had vegetables in it, not just soy). On to our server Eric who was really charming and helpful with choosing menu items. He never let a water glass go empty and his timing with food drinks and conversation was excellent. The ambiance is also really nice in Joeys!"}
{"text":"Joey's has quickly become a pre-movie night staple. The ambiance, staff, location, food and drinks here are amazing!

First, the staff. Whenever there's an evening wait you can bet the hostesses will serve you delightful samples of whatever their daily choice may be. I've had craft beers, house wines, little tapas style treats that make the wait feel amazing. There seems to always be a wait, but it goes by fast and has become part of the experience. I last tried their house white, a sampling so successful my friend and I shared a bottle once we were seated.

Not only that, but the servers must be the sweetest people I've ever met. Loren was my server last night and she was amazing. As a past server myself I appreciate someone who knows what they're doing, who is sweet and professional and brings additional joy to the experience.

I've only really had salads here but I've loved them both. Flavourful with generous, quality ingredients. Perfect diced avocado. Juicy chicken. A friend of mine was concerned her chicken wasn't cooked completely and Loren said the kitchen is pretty anal about making sure things are cooked thoroughly, but quickly offered to take it away, brought her a small salad in the meantime, and had the manager come check on us later in the evening once a new, perfectly cooked dish had been returned.

Prices are a little high, but they're not unreasonable considering the location. They have daily drink specials and I highly recommended the cocktails with the slush added in. They're strong but divine, just the way I like them.  

If you're looking for something a little more upscale with a great vibe, Joey's is your place. I will continue to return here often."}
{"text":"I've been to JOEY Eaton's before. It reminds me of an upscale Cactus Club (for you transplanted Vancouverites who will understand the reference immediately). Nothing special. But a safe bet when you go out with a group you don't know their eating preference."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and this place has got service figured out. Right when I walked in there was someone to great us and offer us a free sample of wine and appetizer while we waited for our table to be ready. Our server was very engaging and always available when we needed something.

The food was solid. We started with these ahi tuna taco appetizers, which we both enjoyed and our main dishes were butter chicken and a chicken sandwich. Nothing ground breaking, but they were both done well.

All in all I would come back to this restaurant and recommend people give it a try."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! I like that they have soy protein available for vegetarians, so I ordered the tandoori flatbread with no cheese and soy protein. Very delicious and satisfied my craving for some Indian flavour. 

The service was very friendly and quick and we got our food in a good amount of time. We went around 6 so it wasn't super busy though. 

all in all the food was pretty good and probably would go again for a casual dinner!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and customer service is okay, but the quality of their food isn't all that. I don't recommend it for anything more the drinks if it's convenient"}
{"text":"Another argument for a half star option. 3.5 stars. A casual chain restaurant where you could also show up dressed up and not feel out of place. Dark, romantic lighting. Young female waitresses dressed in tight fighting but not slutty LBDs. Only the freshest of ovaries need apply. Avoid any Hannibal Lecter lecherous deep breaths as your waitress draws near. But that's the style these days: Moxie's, Earl's, the venerable Hooters, etc. Is this the stripbar of the 21st century? As one of my lovely dining companions Sara K P noted about strip bars \"the waitresses are always hotter looking than the talent\". Maybe Moxie's, Joey, Earl's etc. have come to recognize that. A 20 year old in a tight LBD is still a fine tease for a forty something man. We (speaking for all 40 year olds) know what a naked woman looks like. We know what a naked woman with surgical scars looks like. $9 for a bottle of beer to see that? It's free on sploogetube. But a 20 year old that's trying to be cute and fresh with us for a tip? And then add alcohol. Why it's the North American version of the Japanese Image Club (http://www.japanfortheuninvited.com/articles/image-clubs.html).

Anyway, I only had eyes for my female companions that night: The One True Chris P and Sara K P (no relation). Seriously, you know you've made a series of right choices in life when those two beauts end up at your table. *eye flutter*

We shared the edamame and the apple pie at the end. The apple pie was more like a beaver tail with apple filling and maple syrup ice cream on top. I'd go back just to order two of those for myself.

I had the high top burger or high tower burger or something. In keeping with the state of dining out in Toronto these days, they want $16 for a burger and fries. Sigh. The burger, despite our pneumatic waitress's claim the burger was pretty impressive, it was no Five Guys. The shoe string fries, however, were quite enjoyable.

As Sara K P notes, the washrooms are ill planned, seemingly requiring you to trek all the way to the Canadian Tire. They try to make light of this with some signage. I might have someone in a minotaur costume wander the hall for better effect. There's a point, after the second stair case where you turn a corner, see you're still 29 meters away and shout out \"seriously?\""}
{"text":"Hosted a private function for a charitable organization at JOEY. All the staff were really friendly and went above and beyond to help make our event a success. The food was good and the private event space had a very nice atmosphere. It is two flights of stairs down though but it's next to the washrooms!"}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday and we reserved a table for dinner.

Our meals came in a timely fashion. I ordered the Spicy Chicken sandwich with fries and devoured it. It was savoury, not spicy at all. I tried some of the Mushroom pasta, it tasted alright. The Butter chicken was pretty good, it came with a variety of sides. The Ahi Tuna sandwich was the favourite. 
Good all around, zero complaints on the food.

We all got ice cream for dessert - the flavour of the day was Espresso and it was delicious! Their Scoop of Care initiative for the month of August, donated $1 from each scoop to a local charity.

Great experience. Good for groups. Nice ambiance. Happy with the service."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants has hit the d/t core.

I am a huge fan of Joey's with their unique and tasty food to their beautiful and wonderful waitresses. This is the place to go after work or just chill with friends to have a drink. 

I've been to this place two times already since it opened two weeks ago and the service is always outstanding and consistent. While you're waiting for your table waitresses come up and consistently give you food samples and drinks up until your table is ready. They have got the right idea when it comes customer service where the focus is on you and lets face it that will always make you keep coming back for more. The waitresses are very quick and approachable. Our waitresses in particular were always ready to help you out, as well like to make little conversations here and there whenever they could. I never once asked for a refill b/c our waitresses Brenda and Kristen were on it. Amazing service all around!

The interior is very beautiful with the dark tones, hard wood, with a very modern touch. The patio has a very nice concept, with a wide open area with a roof over your head looking out onto the busy Dundas St. The bar area is right in the middle and is the loudest part of the restaurant, due to all the speakers playing overhead, making it feel like a lounge. If you're looking for a more quieter atmosphere I would suggest you go upstairs to their one dining area, or to the very far right side of the bar or the patio area.  

The food at this place does not disappoint, it's very consistent, fresh, and has that West Coast touch to it. During this visit we got a Rainbow Roll, Chili Chicken, Calamari, Ahi Tuna Tacos, Baha Tacos, and Sashimi Tuna Salad. We always get both tacos b/c they're so damn good and different, the wasabi lime sauce that they have on the side with the Ahi Tuna Tacos just compliments the tacos very well. The Chili chicken was PERFECT, that combination of the cold cucumber and the spicy, deep fried chicken was so refreshing. The deep fried calamari was very good on is own, but even better with the sauce they provided with. My only complaint about it was that it was a little salty. I ordered the Rainbow Roll expecting nothing of it, b/c to order a pure Japanese dish at a non-Japanese restaurant, yeah, I wasn't expecting it to be the best. However, they made a good attempt, the presentation was very nice, as well you could definitely taste the freshness of the seaweed and fish, but the rice was missing that vinaigrette flavor. My favorite dish at Joey's right now is the Sashimi Tuna Salad, the combination of greens, crunchy Asian noodles, juicy chunky mangoes, with a light vinaigrette sauce, and 10 pieces of really fresh, seared Ahi tuna. It's just heavenly. 

Price wise you're looking at $12-$30 for food, drinks are $3 and up, one amazing experience, Priceless. :-D 

Items to definitely get:

-Sashimi Tuna Salad
-Ahi Tuna Tacos
-Baja Fish Tacos
-Lobster Grilled Cheese
-BC Halibut & Shrimp Spaghettini
-Chili Chicken

BTW, check out my Joey Don Mills review, for more information about the restaurant and other food items."}
{"text":"I organized a drinks event at Joey's and they were great. We had a long table upstairs, and one waitress who was probably one of the best. She took really good care of us (even bringing us extra waters to balance the alcohol).

The only thing I absolutely love from here is the Shrimp Flatbread, it is amazing. whole milk mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, & chipotle aioli all topped with baby shrimp. Sounds amazing right? It is! 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Visiting town on biz from the U.S.  Work colleagues recommended Joey as one of their favs, so had to try it. Thursday night at 5:30 and the wait was about 30 mins.  However, the wait was the best part - they have a hostess assigned to keep the crowd happy by bringing out wonderful samples of food and drink - flatbread, sushi, Bellini's to name a few. And hostess Morgan was delightful and clearly loves her job - made the wait fun and entertaining - kudos to Morgan.  Sat at a nice booth in the corner which allowed us to talk over dinner. I had the shrimp pesto flatbread which was one of the samples.  Delicious with a nice kick, though I like my flatbreads more like cracker crust and this one was a bit bready - personal preference. Colleague had the salmon and had to try the deep fried mashed potatoes- she loved the salmon and thought the mashed were interesting with the texture of a fried coating.  Service was great all around.  My only negative comment is that the rest rooms are 2 flights downstairs, but not inconvenient enough to deduct a star.  Highly recommend this restaurant and would love to return."}
{"text":"This Joey's is located right beside the Eaton's Centre, it is not accessible through the mall - but it's less than a minute walk, so don't worry if it's winter time!

I visited Joey's Eaton's Centre location with a close friend of mine I hadn't seen in a while. Made a reservation, requested a booth even though it was just the two of us (yeah, it's a faux pas without a party of three in a booth, so sue me) lol!

The hostess was extremely nice upon arrival, greeted us. Brought us to the booth. I ordered a burger with bacon and mushroom, all toppings and a side of sweet potato fries and a corona. My friend had the lobster ravioli.

My friend was sick (not because of the food, don't worry, it hasn't come yet) and asked the waitress for green tea. After she chatted with us, she said, \"do you want honey as well for your throat?\"  quality service. I was impressed not only at the fact she cared, she seemed happy even though she might've not liked her job that much.

Anyways, she brought my corona with the green tea and honey. It didn't take too long for the food to come. Let me just say, for a CHAIN RESTAURANT... this burger actually tasted really good. The mushrooms were salted and tasted amazing. The cheese was cheesy and perfect. The only thing I would point out is I never get enough fries anywhere... or maybe that's just because I love fries and would want an unlimited amount... but the burger was definitely amazing. I didn't expect that at all.

The food was great, the service was amazing!

4/5!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a buddy who lives locally, and was initially a bit disappointed as it seemed pretty touristy (makes sense given the location) but ended up having tasty food and a solid experience overall.

Happy hour: $4 beers, G&T, Sangria, and other bites/drinks, which was a nice surprise (late night HH Sun-Thurs). During my trip to Toronto, I still haven't found a Canadian IPA that can compare to what we have in California, but the Muskoka Mad Tom IPA was at least passable.

Food: Tuna tacos were surprisingly good, and as someone who isn't a big fan of just raw fish, I really liked the fact that they had other flavors, like you'd find in a Poke bowl. For a main, I got the Butter chicken after the waitress recommended it. I was apprehensive at first but it was really good! The naan was charred which actually worked well with the chicken and sauce, which was a bit spicier than the butter chicken I'm used to which added a nice extra dimension to the flavor.

Overall, if you're in the area Joey is a solid option, especially if you can take advantage of the happy hour specials. Service was a bit on the slow side considering the place wasn't busy at all, but not a big deal and the food was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"When I first entered through the front doors of the Eaton Centre incarnation of Joey's, I wondered if I'd accidentally walked into Ford's models. The waitresses who work here are halting in their good looks. As Zoolander would say 'Reediculoosely good looking'. Haha. Beautiful waitresses aside, this is a restaurant that on it's own is most definitely worth visiting. The atmosphere is ambient with energetic overtones, and the set up lends itself to keeping the crowds engaged and able to enjoy the whole room from the comfort of their table.

I ordered the Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo, and it was quite tasty. It came with a garlic bread appetizer which was also flavorful. I accompanied it with tonic water which balanced out the cream sauce and cleansed my palate for the garlic bread.

The only complaint I would make is that the bathrooms are about 5 miles away from the dining area, and you keep thinking you're about to walk into the kitchen until three floors later, you arrive. If you're there for drinks only, you better have a big bladder.

Worth checking out"}
{"text":"Place is great - but get there early in the evenings.  It'll get busy."}
{"text":"Not sure why they have lower ratings because my experience was superb. Good personable service combined with an awesome interior. 

We came here for lunch and it was one of the better dining experiences I had in Toronto. The food came within 10-15 minutes and everything was superb. We had the bbq salmon bowl, the Spanish penne, and the lobster ravioli. Spot on flavors and good portion size. Did no appetizers and walked away satisfied. 

I do recommend calling in a reservation ahead of time because it was packed. 

We were in and out within the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Great but not amazinggggg , I had the fillet mignion which was tender and juicy and had a really good  seasoning on it .. The potatoes are different in a good way iv never had them prepared like that and I must say I loved the crunch.  I had an extremely refreshing cucumber & strawberry mojito  to drink and a chocolate soufflé with vanilla ice cream for dessert. I have no real complaints the service was alright and the decor is nice. Very impressive for a chain restaurant I must say!"}
{"text":"Went here with the gf and ordered the lobster grilled cheese, fish tacos and chicken wings. While the lobster was good, the fish tacos were so-so and the chicken wings were like the grocery store ones. Service was not as attentive. Will come back just for the lobster"}
{"text":"Great spot..  Awesome staff..  Great food..  Had the French Dip sandwich and it was great"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for about 20 people at Joey's for a wedding weekend lunch with friends. We arrived and our table was ready and the server was nice. The positive experience ends there. It took forever to get our drinks (and my pomegranate mojito was absolutely terrible). I asked for a Splenda because the drink was so blah and our waitress didn't get it for me (nor did she ask whether I didn't like my drink). I proceeded to go up and ask for Splenda at the bar. The food was subpar and SUPER overpriced. $18 for an ahi tuna salad with like 6 tiny pieces of tuna? After we were almost finished eating, an insanely loud fire alarm started going off. Deafening. Did the waitress come over and let us know what was going on? Nope. Just heard the manager call out \"don't worry about it, it's fine.\" All we wanted to do was get our check rather than sit and continue to lose our hearing by the second, but our waitress was no where to be found. We finally went up to the bar and asked the manager to find our waitress to bring our checks. We finally got our checks and left hungry and way poorer than we should've been. Would never go back"}
{"text":"Service was okay. Food wasn't the greatest. Ordered calamari it took forever to come and ended up being cold."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Joey.  The wait was long but they brought us appetizers and drinks in the mean while.
I went with a friend, we orded a few appetizers and an entree to share.
Ahi Tuna Tacos were really delicious.  Simple clean flavours.
Calamari was crispy and not oily with a good dipping sauce.
Chicken fettucine alfredo was tasty, the pasta was cooked just right.
Our server was friendly and they have a great drink menu.  Even though the restaurant was packed on a Friday night service was fast and attentive. 
Would definitely come again with friends."}
{"text":"Joey is a better moxies and I don't like moxies. The vibe is a bit pretentious from staff. The back of the kitchen was like having their own party with screaming and yelling while taking a group photo. I thought it was a private party but it was their staff. So unprofessional and obnoxious.

Food was ok nothing special and more expensive than other establishments.  Waitress was nice and attentive though.


I think they only do well because it's attached to the mall. Tons of better restaurants to go to, would pass."}
{"text":"I walked past this place the other day and I bookmarked it to come back! I love the atmosphere in here. Upscale feel without super expensive prices. The manager actually bought me a beer simply because I asked him to pour me his favorite. Lol. He actually told me to guess what he poured me then he would buy it for me. I guessed wrong, but he still bought it for me. Ha. I started with the chili chicken, which was a very good starter then I followed with the herb crusted salmon. My goodness. Incredible. That sauce was just amazing, hollandaise sauce made the whole dish work together."}
{"text":"I've been at this Joey many times over the years mainly due to it's central downtown location.  The large area inside makes it an easy place to grab a table and it's late hours make it convenient. The general vibe is upscale pub with fancier food options. They have been consistent with availability and food on multiple visits. 

The food is good and delivers on what is promised, but never really surprises me in any way. Had the steak frites recently on the weekend, the steak was cooked to specification but the fries were not crisp and more on the soggy side. Service was a little absent minded, but our server was apologetic about the misses so it was forgivable. Will probably be back sometime in the future due to convenience alone."}
{"text":"Terrible services, I have been in many high end restaurants down to the lowest \" jackastors\", this by far takes the cake for worst service and decent dinner, 5  drinks later Is the only thing that kept me from walking out..."}
{"text":"I like their Tacos best. I have been there a couple of times. I like their dishes but nothing really sticks."}
{"text":"5 star restaurant, great food, price, and service!!  There are other high-end restaurants nearby, but this has to be one of the better ones, must check out!!"}
{"text":"We made reservations here before the show Annie at The Ed Mirvish theatre. Parking underground at Yonge Dundas Square was easy and a short walk to the restaurant. The restaurant is in the Eaton centre so lots of shopping close by.
Our server, Colin (I think) was wonderful! Friendly, extremely knowledgeable and helpful in selecting our meals.
We started with vegan gf lettuce wraps that were delicious.
I had the veg burger on lettuce that was very messy and difficult to eat but was tasty. One niece had the fish tacos and enjoyed them, as well as the mousse for dessert. Other niece had the salmon and said it was the best she ever had. Then she enjoyed the apple pie. My sister loved her spaghetti and meatballs.
We sat in a booth on the main level. The main washrooms are clean and nice but down 2 sets of stairs and through long hallways. There are 4 individual washrooms on the main floor tucked away in the back. Long lines but much closer."}
{"text":"I met up with a few friends on Feb. 16 for a birthday and we headed to Joey. This was my first time at a Joey and it was nothing out of the ordinary. 

The actual restaurant is beautiful and pretty large. We had a reservation so there was no waiting time for us but I did overhear the hostess tell other guests it would be a 35-40 minute wait. We got seated in one of the boots upstairs that seats 7. The hostess was extremely sweet but our waitress gave us the impression that she would rather be somewhere else and not serving customers. We literally had to wave her down anytime we needed a refill or had a question. Other than that she was pretty to herself behind the bar. 

Food - meh. I ordered the wings because it seemed to be the safest bet. Nothing stand out. Wings were kind of thin but the portions were great. Their '500 Salad' was amazing though! If you want meat, you can add chicken on for an additional cost. It's a great salad, worth a try. 

Overall Joey was ok. It's not a place I'd absolutely recommend to people but it's not horrible."}
{"text":"Great place over all, love the open kitchen in the back and hosted was very pleasant. Our servers Will and Justin were super nice and attentive. We tried mushroom soup, bags fish tacos, chicken salad, as well as gin cocktail and beer. Their salad was amazing - had such a great combination of chicken, avocados, cabbage, beets, grape, nuts, peas and more! Ingredients super fresh !!! Loved the tacos - full of flavor. Happy hour 3-6pm."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. The food was excellent, the ambiance was magnetic and the waiters were the nicest people I have met. I loved it and I am absolutely returning to this place. Congratulations!!"}
{"text":"the food is good. 
However, the service XXXXXX Maybe it was too busy, that i sit there for a half hour and still no waitress asked me what to order = = I was too hungry ........... I wont go there again if I am starving, cuz i probly cannot wait till i can make an order = ="}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere , good food and service - nothing more to add to it. I would come back next time for a quick bite"}
{"text":"I just want to make it clear from the get go this 5 star review is mainly based on the customer service I received today.

I came into Joeys today for a Birthday lunch for my daughter. We were the first ones basically as we were there at 11am when it first opened.

We were seated by a very pleasant host. We were seated by the window area/street view. I will say the booths were not clean. There were quite a bit of crumbs that I believe were probably from the night before.

Along came our waiter, Justin. Let me tell you how friendly and welcoming this gent was. Sadly, you have to appreciate great service as it is so rare these days to experience such stellar service while dinning anymore.

He must have checked on us at least 15 times to make sure we were okay. My daughter didn't know what she wanted to drink so he told us about a frozen lemonade drink he could make her which was so yummy!. 

On to the food. We ordered their hand pressed burger w/ fries, tandoori flatbread and the Baha fish tacos.

The burger was dope! So fresh and tasty. The meat was cooked perfectly! The flatbread was okay but my stomach wasn't agreeing with the Chutney part in it. I feel like Ishtar certain element wasn't in it it could be very good.

The tacos were just okay too, I don't know if the tacos are deliberately suppose to be hard to separate but every time I took a bite the taco was hard to rip apart.

My daughter didn't know what she wanted for dessert but she did not want anything on the menu. Again, Justin suggested that he could make anything happen for her so she asked if she could have Vanilla Ice Cream with chocolate sauce and whip cream. I asked Justin if he could write Happy Birthday and he replied with a \"no problem\".

I can't wait to come back here and hopefully have the same experience with another waiter if Justin isn't there. I know it can be a hit & miss with waiters/waitresses but I will keep you posted. I also am looking forward to trying the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Don't go....tried to host 8 people for a work dinner and this place clearly can't seat more than tables of 5 comfortably.   Waited more than 45 mins to no table and I had a reservation for 3 weeks.   It's run by inexperienced restaurant people and is nothing more than a mid range chain.  Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"My go to plsce whenever I am hungry and cant decide what cuisine I want to eat specifically. The bombay chicken here is one of the best chicken preparations I have had. If you like spicy food, tell the server to make bombay chicken fiery hot.. it becomes  spicy but I loved it personally. The other dishes also deserve the 5 star and The service is commendable. They all are sweet and courteous and I should mention Hot also :p all in all a very good experience and its definietly my top rated places in Toronto"}
{"text":"Keeping this short as all the Missus and I did was have a few rounds before shopping (buzzed shopping is the way to go!).

It's huge, the bar is very appealing, they have the Sports Package (Centre Ice, Sunday Ticket etc), a massive projection screen, multiple tvs at the bar, free WiFi and daily drink specials, which I believe every licenced establishment should offer. 

As noted many times, a good looking staff, and they are everywhere. Our server was very sweet and, more importantly, genuine. 

We sat directly by drink service however they were very slow preparing the server's drink orders. A single bartender works for the size of the bar, but she needed support on service. With so many staff and management wandering around, someone should've jumped in to help.

Love the lit-up picture above the urinals. Classic."}
{"text":"The food here is very typical of a chain restaurant/sports bar. 
Quality is pretty decent, and drinks are also pretty good. 
I tried the sushi/steak - surprisingly much better than one would expect from a non-Asian restaurant. 
Location is great (of course, smack downtown Toronto), and is very live with sports games playing all around. I was very pleased that they had tennis playing when I went, as some places you'd only find the typical basketball/hockey/baseball/soccer on. However, it was the US open so it's likely a more televised event anyways."}
{"text":"I had the best Tuna sandwich here!!Staff was very friendly,we had to wait for the food a bit longer  just because they were very busy but definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Attended a private function in the lower private dining room.  

Greeted by the event coordinator and hostess for the evening.  An outstanding professional.  Friendly, charming and welcoming she was able to make people comfortable and at ease immediately.  Her wine suggestions were excellent as well.  I'd be very confident hosting a party with her coordinating.

Appetizers were very nice but little lettuce wraps were really nice treat in particular.  Dinner was nice and key lime pie very tasty but I think I was more impressed by the service overall.

Despite being in the basement, room itself was actually fine. Private bar area and separate dinner tables gave it a nice feel.  I'd lose the giant TV or at least change to something else (fireplace channel maybe?)."}
{"text":"Unplanned visit for a very early lunch today. The restaurant was largely empty so service was fast and friendly. They were accommodating with my kid's egg allergy and even offered to make her a grilled cheese (not on the menu) which was appreciated.

The food - it's part of a chain so I had sampled their menu before:
Fish tacos were solid
Kid's grilled cheese had real cheese, served with good yam fries
Rainbow roll - well it is sushi at a non-Japanese restaurant, but it was alright. It contained real crab rather than surimi which was nice.

This is a huge open space with high ceilings and big booths, but it still manages to feel cozy. Convenient location at the Eaton Centre and near the Ed Mirvish theatre."}
{"text":"4 stars for service with several nice* touches to make it special, 3 for food.  

I had heard the hype around this restaurant since opening but was never inclined to go and wait for hours to eat especially when there are other restaurants in the area. But in need of a late late dinner (10.30pm) we went there and it was a 15 minute wait but that was ok since their kitchen is open till 2am we knew we wouldn't be rushed to eat. Plus since they call u, you can walk around Dundas Square until your table is ready. 

The wait was pleasant, we got offered a Kim Crawford complimentary wine* and the hosts kept checking on us with table updates and apologies for the wait - so nice of them! 

Table was ready in the time they said and we sat in a booth for 2. The hostess hang up my bfs coat on the coat rack for no wrinkling nice*! Our server was extremely attentive, professional and have us some drink suggestions. I tried their Friday drink (vanilla vodka and coke) which was nice and sweet. For dinner had their regular burger and that was where the low food rating comes. It was dry and tasteless, how can you mess up a burger??? (salt, Dijon, ketchup, more salt!!! Nothing helped!) after that disappointment I lost my appetite and had my fries packed to go ( they give u a cloth bag to go nice* touch). 

Dessert was the molten lava soufflé - now that perked things up! It was warm, moist and just hit the spot. 

The ambience was relatively calm for a warm Friday night so that was great. And I
Can't speak highly enough about the service, right up to when we left 2 hours later - the hostess wished us good night and that was that. I may be back, I'll give it a few months."}
{"text":"ok so who's my server?

SERVER
In the course of 1 hour, I think we had 3 servers. When it came time to tip...I was like...who am I really tipping?

DRINKS
I had a bellini ($6.50). It was pretty and had a frozen peach inside.

Other than that, it's your typical chain of bars with goodlooking servers."}
{"text":"I went there alone at Sunday evening after a terrible movie to cheer me up. I had the peppercorn new york steak, chocolate souffle. The steak is just not so good. I myself can cook better than that. I ordered medium. However it is a little bit burnt on the outside(but it's medium in the inside, I don't know how that happened). And It is not evenly seasoned which make it really salty somewhere but not as seasoned elsewhere. And the crispy mashed potato. It is not so crispy at all. It was really good when I first went there. Anyway, the steak is definitely need some more work. The souffle is really really good, which totally made my day. It's still warm but not hot when it's served, just the perfect temperature for your taste buds. And the souffle and the chocolate inside literally melt in your mouth. I can feel a little bit salt, which made the chocolate even more tasty and smooth.it's definitely chocoholic's favourite. It is a little bit too sweat for me, but the vanilla ice cream can totally save that.
Anyway, I would give 2 for the steak and 5 for the souffle."}
{"text":"Hosted a group of business colleagues here last night. Great venue. Our server Kim was a gem! 

Lively atmosphere helped by the Blue Jays winning a chance to stay in the hunt for the World Series. 

As for food and drink, Kim was very knowledgable on all the options. Only did a few appetizers to share but they were very good."}
{"text":"Food is four stars but overpriced. Washroom is very far downstairs. Place is always loud that I can barely hear my guests."}
{"text":"This place is much better than the reviews make it out to be. Had a steak frites for 22$ and it was very good for the price.
Ambiance is really nice with the patio, absolutely lovely.
We were served by Rhonda M and she was super kind!
Will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a warm, sunny afternoon for drinks and dessert after hearing about their great patio.

The patio wasn't quite what I expected - it wasn't actually outside per se... just had really large garage-type windows that were opened up to let in the sunlight, but you were still \"inside\" and covered the whole time. It grew on me after a while, and I think it's a pretty smart idea for a patio in Toronto given the cold weather the majority of the time.

Our waitresses were friendly, prompt and quick. They accommodated us for a table by the window with a smile, and gave us a free pint of beer after a fly fell into one of them (through no fault of theirs really).

We tried:
Drinks: AMF spanish sangria, bellini, blueberry mojito and rolling rock beer
Food : rainbow roll and strawberry shortcake

The drinks were very good, and they had a good selection of beers from different parts of the world. The food was alright - nothing very notable. I will have to try a proper meal here sometimes.

Overall it reminds me very much of Earls and Milestones - pretty, young waitresses, sleek decor, and decent drinks and food. It's a nice addition to the Eaton Centre area, but doesn't really stand out for me."}
{"text":"I went once a year or two ago and it was GOOD, now it's barely passable. The quality of food has diminished greatly. I went last night and the food generally is ill prepared, flavourless and boring. 

My one friend has sent his food back twice in the past 2 times we have gone. Butter chicken small portions and bland.

Chicken souvlaki: YUCK

drinks are OK, and the service staff are nice to look at. 

It's priced fairly HIGH for mediocre food."}
{"text":"A group of I and I just went to catch up and eat something before venturing out for the rest of the night. 

The decor of the restaurant is very pleasant. A modern touch, sleek and unpretentious. The space is very big and they have a very nice covered patio. 

Our group of six were seated to a big and round table and everyone was able to talk to each other without having the need to scream. 

Our waitress came pretty fast and took the drink/food orders. She always made sure to pass by that everything was going good and was keen to chat with us a little. 

Foodwise, they are not re-inventing the wheel. The items are rather standard but they do have a good variety. 

I tried the crusty mashed potatoes and the ravioli with lobster sauce and prawns (3/5). The prawns were very well cooked and had a great kick to it. The sauce and pasta had nothing stellar but still OK to eat. 

I was pleased with the crusty mashed potatoes, easy to eat and rather good(4/5).

Now, my friend ordered their Roasted Mushroom Pasta (1/5) and we all tried it. It really wasn't stellar. Firstly, the presentation makes it look like some Hamburger Helper dish. But what brought my friend to return the dish (and I so agree) was the very strong after taste of oil. That pretty much all you could taste. 

The waitress was very nice about it and proposed him to order any other main. He add the California Burger (4/5) and it arrived very fast. 

Overall a good experience. Since the pasta dish had the mention \"Test Kitchen\", my friend tried to give some feedback to the waitress, so the chef could know, but she wasn't the most interested in what he had to say other than propose another dish. Maybe something to work on."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant in the city - great selection of amazing food. (LOVE the Ahi tuna club). Very nice decor and exceptional service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and arriving smack in the middle of not just Canada Day, but Canada Day #150? WHOAH - absolutely off the chain (don't even know if that expression is still in play but - eh - this is my review, not yours).

After spending time checking out the sights, sounds, people, culture, dancing, music, and FIREWORKS (all this straight off the Amtrak from NYC y'all), the gut was growling and junk wasn't going to work.

After some nifty online research (of course consulting yours truly - Yelp), Joey's came up on the list. It was on the way back to the hotel too so that worked. Surrounded by the thousands of people we ducked inside Joey's and checked the menu real quick.

Menu looked dope so we grabbed some tables.

Words that come to mind describing Joey's would be modern, eclectic, stylish, trendy, classy. I actually had to ask if it was okay to be seated as I had a t-shirt, shorts, and sneakers on (there were a number of well dressed dates taking place while we were there)

NOTE: the bathroom is TWO FLIGHTS down and around several hallways and down some corridors (there are elevators though).

The fish tacos jumped off the menu first - but then jumped right back on the menu when I realized the fish was fried first then used in tacos (I like grilled/roasted fish tacos, thank you). I then saw the Katsu Chicken Peanut Salad and thought that would be a good dish. My better half had the Mushroom Burger with skinny fries.

It was. The flavor and texture was amazing. There's arugula, some julienned veggies, crispy onions on top, and the chicken breast was breaded and whole (not choppped). All on a deliciously flavored peanut sauce. The vegetables were tossed in a soy ginger glaze. It all came together on the plate.

The Mushroom Burger was also reported as juicy and delicious - definitely above average.

TWO STARS OFF for forgetting about us. We sat while two other groups were seated, orders taken, and food served. Our waitress was actually quite attentive and thoughtful - once we notified her that we had been there for over 30 minutes and no one provided anything other than water and soda.

Would I return? Maybe with a reservation and perhaps not on Canada Day. The food was actually really good. Just have to get the service in line."}
{"text":"I find joey to be very similar to Earls. Everything is great on the menu. Had the burnt salmon sushi and it was great. Not a fan of Dundas square area as it's filled with very odd people and touristy but the restaurant is great."}
{"text":"Food never disappoints. For a restaurant chain, have to say quality is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy Toronto and have made it a point to dine at Joey during my last two visits. The atmosphere is beautiful, well designed and very comfortable. The staff is always friendly and helpful---very knowledgeable about the menu and beverages. I had the blackened salmon salad (a spicy chicken sandwich on my previous trip) and my friend had the fish tacos. The food is well prepared, presented and delicious. I can't say enough good things about Joey at the Eaton Centre. I can't wait to go back, soon!"}
{"text":"Joeys is always a good spot when you want some good drinks and dinner. Came here on a Friday night, got some bubbly while I waited for my table (still a 40 min wait though). Once we got there, service was good (although water top up was forgotten a few times) but overall the experience is always pleasant. 

Food is always delicious here. Love the flat breads, ahi tuna sandwich, salads etc. This time I got paella for dinner. It was good but a little greasy. They had a DJ on Friday night who played awesome tunes. My friend even grabbed his card for potentially DJing her wedding (he was that good). I'll definitely be back and frequently."}
{"text":"Service was attrocious and manager was not helpful at all. Took about 20 minutes for first drinks to be brought over after ordering. Server was just texting while they were sitting on the bar."}
{"text":"I love going to Joey's (been to quite a few other locations), but for this review I'll only be giving it 2 stars for multiple reasons. First off, the food was just okay. I usually love Joey's food but I'm not sure if it was just that one night was off, or if it's this location since it's my first time coming to the Eaton Centre one. I ordered the steak with butterflied prawns and it came out at room temperature and became cold quickly. My sirloin was also undercooked as if it was blue rare.. which I definitely did not ask for. The crispy mashed potatoes were really chewy, it was not crispy at all. Everything was just at room temperature and got cold real fast. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which he told me wasn't good at all. He loves that dish but he didn't even finish his dish and that never happens so you know it's bad when... The drinks were okay, I got the frozen rose and he got the mojito. I prefer the Cactus Club frose over Joey's.. nice attempt at it though haha. For appetizers, we shared the yam fries with truffle aioli??? It was meh. The apple pie with vanilla ice cream was also meh. All the food was just MEH. Maybe it was just that one night but I was so disappointed with their food because I honestly love eating at Joey's. Last but not least, it was a Thursday night at 9pm and it honestly wasn't that busy and there were people working.. but it took forever to get their attention. Our server barely took care of us, he was always mia. We often saw him sitting at another table flirting with these girls lol, can you believe it he actually sat down at a booth with other customers to flirt with them while he's working. We were trying to get the bill but it legit took over 15 minutes because he just wasn't paying attention to our table/tables he was serving. 

On the bright side, I love the atmosphere of this location in comparison to all the other ones. I do want to come back again and give it another shot because I truly believe it was just one bad experience and we got unlucky."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a date. We made reservations online on a Saturday night and had no trouble being seated quickly. They even placed us right next to the wine rack and we could peek into the kitchen. The atmosphere is very nice. We had the yam fries with the lemon mayo, steak & sushi, and hand pressed burger along with a strawberry cucumber mojito. We both loved the fries. Boyfriend enjoyed his burger a lot and I agree that it was delicious. The steak I got was more medium than the medium rare I requested and too salty, as it was drowning in its pool of ponzu sauce. The sushi was much better, no complaints there but I would order something else next time. We were pretty happy with our overall experience though."}
{"text":"The food here is very hit or miss. The last time I went here, I was surprised they still had the ahi tuna club on their menu, as most locations had taken it off. I ordered the sandwich, a side of soup, and two of their shrimp tempura sushi cones.

The ahi tuna, which is supposed to be seared, was completely cooked through and dry, and the soup was pretty tasteless and bland. In hindsight I should have sent it back. The sushi cones, while not bad, were definitely not memorable.

It's strange that, while JOEY is a franchise, the food seems to differ so much from location to location. Shops at Don Mills seems to be the best, and most consistent. Overall though, while the food wasn't the best, the service was on point and they managed to accommodate a party of 20 fairly well. 

2.5/5*"}
{"text":"I came here the other night and it was pretty busy for a Monday evening and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table which is a pretty long time seeing as it was a Monday at about 7:00. We were seated by the window with a nice view of Younge 
Street. I've walked by this place for a while and I've always wanted to try it and as the chain is expanding locations to Sherway Gardens.
I ordered the California Chicken sandwich with no tomato. The food took about 15 minutes to come out which is pretty quick seeing as the place seemed super busy.The food was great, tasted fresh and although it seemed like not a lot of food when it first came to the table as I like huge meals with extra everything it actually really filled me up.
I would maybe come back if I was in the area. There is so much good food around in the downtown core though that its hard to commit to going back to a restaurant unless it really stands out and Joeys although it was good there are other restaurants in the area that I would try before coming back here but Im sure I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Love coming to Joey in Toronto! Great walk to get here and love the food and service! My favorite - the House-Made Veggie Burger! So healthy and so tasty. And on this brisk, cold Fall day, the cream of mushroom soup! Love it!  my bartender, Carmen is so lovely and amazingly attentive and informative. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I want to start with saying that I like JOEY's but  the service is terrible. And the last time I ate there just pushed me over the edge. My friend and I joined a table with our friends who had already ordered their meals. The server came to us, did not acknowledge us or anything, and just asked how they were doing. We had to flag her down to make an order. 20 minutes after making our order, she told me that my item wasn't available. No menu, no alternative. So I didn't bother ordering anything. She asked my friend how her food was, my friend was v. honest and told her it was cold and soggy. She just walked away. Someone ordered a coffee at our table and asked for cream...she said the restaurant doesn't carry cream. (wtf?!) Then when taking our bill, she made a disgusted face RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. The server's name is Samantha. We will never be dining at JOEY's again."}
{"text":"Place is delicious but not worth its price. I got the sushi and steak and was still starving after my meal. I'm a 100lb girl so I dont even eat that much. Went for McDonald right after. :). I admit could have got a three course meal but didn't think it's all that awesome for what you get. Meh. Would only go again if someone wanted to hit it up but wouldn't make a special trip or recommend that place. Albeit atmosphere is pretty good--Ambient lighting, very busy and with sport tvs. food just overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I always receive the best service at Joey's, and the last time I visited our waitress really went above and beyond to make our experience at Joey's worth a 5/5 rating. We had gone to Joey's for lunch to celebrate a coworker who is going on maternity leave. Not only was our waitress friendly and energetic, she took the time to learn each of our names and even provided free dessert for our pregnant friend (the cute drawing of a baby in chocolate syrup was an added bonus!)

The delicious food (my favorite is the butter chicken), paired with the amazing service and atmosphere makes Joey Eaton Centre one of the best restaurants in the downtown vicinity."}
{"text":"We went to Joey Eaton restaurant for dinner. The restaurant is beautifully decorated. The service was great as they offered us champagne as we waited for our table. The restaurant was crowded and noisy.

Our waiter was very nice and friendly. We ordered the rotisserie chicken and ribs dish. The ribs were pretty good, but the chicken was kind of dry.

Would we go back? It was very noisy so it was hard to carry a conversation.  The food was okay so maybe we will try some other dishes."}
{"text":"What an amazing location & service ! 

Was here with my yoga friends for lunch to celebrate our halfway point for yoga teacher training. Our group had made a reservation online and Hayley Winters the reservations coordinator was very accommodating. We had only 1-1.5 hrs for lunch & finished right on time. 

The menu was perfect for our group as some were vegans or trying to eat healthy. 

Service was excellent and we got our food very quickly! 

Tried some appetizers...
Trio of Dips (smoked trout dip, cheese dip, hummus, fresh sliced baguette)
- loved this esp. the smoked trout & cheese dip. They also refilled the table with more baguette after we ran out. 
Szechuan Edamame (wok tossed with chilies, garlic, soy sauce)
- was yummy and as expected
Japanese Gyoza (pork dumplings with hot mustard)
- needs more chilli but overall it was good. 

I ordered the 500 salad (organic quinoa, barley, plenty of raw vegetables, watermelon radish, almonds, mint, parsley, avocado). It was absolutely delicious !!! This might be my new fav thing to order at Joeys now. 

Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"\"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\" - Hippocrates

Since the discovery of fire by distant Homo Erectus circa 600,000 BC, we have been striving to satisfy our tongues with great food. It is no coincidence that one of the first evidence of fire was utilized for cooking food. Of course, we have come far from our perilous exodus from the caves and since perfected the preference of our tongues. Joeys defines the pinnacle of our endeavor for excellent food that draws a sharp contrast to our infancy of cooking wild rabbit back in that distant cave.

Hippocrates is often coined as the first medical doctor, he conducted primitive research and developed ethical philosophy of medicine. Although many of his hypotheses are now long proven false, he did get one thing right: \"let food be thy medicine\". If you require a dose of good food as your medicine, Joey's can certainly be your pharmacist. Their flatbread pizza is colourful and flavourful. Their mushroom pasta is bold, earthy and filling. Their Paella is crispy and full of flavour. The apple pie dessert melts on your tongue. Their staff are attentive and friendly, they treat you like you are one of their friends. Great atmosphere with lively crowd. The only small change I would like to see is less saltier food.

Let food be thy medicine and let Joey's supply thy medicine."}
{"text":"I've never quite understood the lure of Joey's. I think i'm just not partial to chain restaurants in general.

Location wise, it's really great right at Yonge and Dundas. 

I guess it's a good safe alternative, but don't expect it to blow your mind or anything. 

And also, expect a long, meandering adventure down many flights of stairs to find the bathroom."}
{"text":"This is always a go-to for a girl's night out as it is close to the subway and has a nice seating (read: you don't have to hear other people's conversations). 

The alcohol list is quite good and they also run daily specials. My special favourite is on Mondays with Bellini. The wine list is also OK and I hear the beer is also not bad. 

Food-wise, I've had their burger, lobster grilled cheese, fish tacos, butter chicken and chicken sandwich. They are all good but my personal favourite is the lobster grilled cheese. It is very tasty. I usually switch my side for yam fries and the mayo that comes with it is very good and tangy. 

Have yet to try their dessert menu as by the time I'm done with my main I'm pretty much stuffed. 

I think I would give the food a 3-star overall but I'm giving it an extra star for the service and the fact that the wait is never liner than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Joey Eaton is located on Dundas Street just west of Yonge Street and attached to 1Dundas. This restaurant is fairly new but is consistently busy, especially with the downtown business crowd and tourists that shop at the Eaton Centre.

I came here for dinner last night with a friend. I had been here about a year ago, not long after it opened, and while it was good, it didn't leave a lasting impression in my head. However, my friend chose so I was happy to go along and give them another try since I'd heard good things recently.

Given that its Christmastime, I had the bright idea to make a reservation so that we wouldn't have to wait. I made a reservation online and I got a follow-up confirmation email and a phone call the day of to confirm my reservation. 

I arrived just at 5:30, the time of my reservation, and the main entry was already packed with people waiting for tables. Once I got to the reception desk, I was taken immediately to my table by a hostess. This was great - waiting in the middle of a crowd of people would have made me difficult to find for the hostess, but the main hostess asked me to step to the side and then specifically kept an eye on me and pointed me out when the hostess seating me came to find me. My friend showed up shortly thereafter and we sat down for dinner.

We poked at the menu for a few minutes and then our waitress came over. She was very friendly, conversational and pleasant, which was nice given the fact that she must have been very very busy (packed restaurant). Our drinks came to the table not too long after (I ordered a drink from the bar that took a little longer but we got water at the table while we waited) and after we'd debated back and forth about what to get, our waitress came back to take our order. I wasn't sure what to get so I asked her for a recommendation between two dishes and she explained that they were both very good but very very different so it all depended on how hungry I was and what kind of experience I was interested in. I ended up going with the Sashimi Tuna salad, a choice I did not regret.

Given that the restaurant was PACKED (a 45-minute wait if you didn't have a reservation, when I arrived at 5:30) our food was out pretty quickly. My salad was presented beautifully and my friend's steak looked great too. The tuna was lightly seared on the outside but mostly raw and was to die for. I don't know that I've ever had sashimi grade fish THAT good in my life  The salad had the right balance of flavors, just a few peanuts, just enough sauce, a few tomatoes... I couldn't get over how tasty this dish was! The portions here aren't overpowering, which was nice because at the end of the meal, my friend and I both remarked that we weren't stuffed but we were pleasantly full. I really want to say more about this salad but I just keep remembering how good it was and then I lose my train of thought.

I have to note as well that one of the managers came by not long after we had started eating and stopped to ask us how everything was tasting, how our service had been. This manager seemed to actually care that we enjoyed our meal and were having a good experience and I saw him a few more times during our meal in our section of the restaurant, checking in on other tables. 

Overall, this restaurant will likely become one of the staples in my downtown repertoire of eateries. If I could, I'd give this restaurant 4.5 stars and I will definitely be back for lunches and dinners with coworkers and friends."}
{"text":"Popped in for dessert one Saturday night and it was the highlight of my downtown visit! So we had the Molten Lava Chocolate cake and boy it made me melt into the seat and make all kinds of sexual moans from its decadence. Now what's interesting is the raspberry sauce and the berries themselves surrounding the dessert give an amazing contrast to the mellow effect of the warm molten chocolate. The tartness from the sauce kinda wakes u up and u open your eyes up and go \"ooooooh\", and then slump back down with another bite of the warm chocolate lol. What a dessert. 

Word of caution: the bathroom is 62 miles away lol! I posted pictures of my journey to the men's room and back. The hilarity continued forever!"}
{"text":"The location can't get much better than this. It was really busy after work on a Friday evening, but we were sat at a table almost immediately. The decor of the restaurant is really nice and there were lots of tvs around the large bar with March Madness games on. 

Our waitress was really sweet to my mother and I. She was polite and came by to check on us a couple times. 

I wish the menu was a bit more expansive, but that's really just because I don't eat seafood and I found much of the menu to include this. I ended up ordering the sweet potato fries (which seemed as though they were just a frozen brand and not worth $9) and caeser salad. My mom got The Beach salad and raved about it afterward.

We had a nice time and the service was great. I just wasn't impressed by the food selection or taste. Try the peach bellini though!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and were seated immediately. Our server was a sweetheart. We started off with the shrimp flatbread (highly recommended) and had two ciroc tonics. She was kind enough to explain her recommendations since I am very indecisive with my choices. The boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli which he said was amazing and I ordered the ahi tuna tacos. There are only four tacos to the order and they are small but it was very filling considering we had the flat bread as an appetizer. I'm so glad they opened a location in Woodland Hills, CA (closer to home). I will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"OMG! Amazing food and service. We had to wait for a table for a few minutes, so they brought around appetizers as well as drinks. There were two of us for dinner. We ordered the shrimp pesto flatbread and calamari for appetizers.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The calamari was not greasy and very tender, not rubbery at all like some restaurants. My friend had the fish tacos and love them. I had the butter chicken. Not your traditional butter chicken, but so much better. The rice head raisins and almonds and other good stuff. The staff was amazingly friendly, that we felt like asking her to take a seat with us."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, fairly quiet on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. Waiters were lovely and friendly, but food is overpriced for its taste. 

Would recommend for a once in a while outing but is again on the pricier Also, burgers are HUGE! I would recommend sharing with someone."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambience, good value!! 35$ pp (no drinks)

I know 35$ is not a cheap meal, but the place is really great! Its an all around good experience from being greeted by a stunning and attentive hostess to the moment the bill comes. The menu gives you a very fair variety to choose from, so your not stuck with a cheese burger meal, all simple, all interesting, all very well done! I specially recommend the \"Ahi Tuna Tacos\"

Ill be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Joey Eaton Centre, you surprised me. 

I've been wanting to check out Joey Eaton Centre for a while now, and finally had the opportunity. Let me be honest - the crowd was kind of...well, douche-y. They seem a little pretentious and Joey's ambiance matches their personalities - kind of \"trying to hard\" - as soon as I sat down I was worried I wouldn't enjoy my experience. 

HOWEVER - my meal was delicious! Thanks to the super helpful (potentially too helpful) servers, who explained exactly what we were ordering, we ate in style. I tried the ahi tuna tacos (YUM!) the chicken lettuce wraps (a little too hoisin-y in my opinion), and then had the filet mignon as my main. 

All the food was really good - and I loved the Asian inspired menu. 

While our meal was a bit pricey, I can see myself coming back, especially for apps/drinks. It turns out the ambiance is tolerable, and the crowd makes for good people watching!"}
{"text":"I got 500 Salad. 
It's a wholesome mixture of quinoa, barley, chopped avocados, slices of currants, slices of watermelon radishes and more. Fresh and healthy. 

I wouldn't come here for food though. Maybe shareables do not represent the quality of food here but the calamari and the chili chicken shareables were gross. The calamari shareable was too mushy and bland while the chili chicken shareable was like a day-old Manchu Wok take-out (not that I've had that myself lol). Nacho chips in the chili chicken dish were better tasting than the chicken pieces. 

Ok food, great location, good service; this place is a fancier cousin of Boston Pizza chains."}
{"text":"Executive Summary: Classic comfort food in an upscale casual setting.

Value (Price/Quality): Good - price point is great with lots of menu options $15-$20 with great portion sizes and taste. Other chain restaurants taste prepackaged but Joey actually tastes fresh.

Customer Service: Good - but inconsistent. As a loyal Joey guest for over +12 years (from Western Canada locations) the service at this specific Joey Eaton Centre has really gone down since they first opened. With the new locations at Sherway, Yorkdale, Don Mills, etc. this Joey Eaton Centre is probably the weakest of all. They have outstanding servers who go above and beyond and some who give zero f's about anything. 

You'll like this place if: If you like chains like Baton Rouge, Earls, Milestones, Moxies, Cheesecake Factory (USA). This will likely become your new favourite joint for last minute get togethers or audience pleasers for big groups who can't decide where to go.

Don't go here if: If you prefer to eat fast food or don't like loud music.

Transportation: No parking. Public Transit (Dundas Station) and Streetcar available. It would be nice if they partnered with a nearby parking lot to offer free validated parking otherwise they are losing all their driving customers who will drive to Sherway and Don Mills. Or this location is perfect to cater to student, downtown urbanites, and downtown tourists.

Tip: Drink specials everyday of the week! Bellini Monday's and Saturday Sangria's are my favourite. Forget the Test Kitchen items on the menu. They are mediocre at best. For sandwich lovers do the Chicken Club Sandwich or Tuna Sandwich or Lobster Grilled Cheese. Local downtown dwellers, visit on Monday and Tuesday nights to avoid line ups and rush. You can also reserve online (book at least 1 week in advance to not be disappointed).

The Good, Bad and Ugly Details: Washrooms are constantly filthy on both ground level and basement level for an \"upscale casual restaurant\". Sometimes if you are waiting long, the hostess will offer samples. If you share feedback about their test kitchen items online, to a waiter - it will go no where. Bring back the raspberry ice tea!

Yelp Customer Bottom Line: Despite the inconsistent experiences I've had, I still keep coming back because their core menu offerings are always satisfying and make up for their short falls. 

Business Opportunity: Instead of placing the test kitchen items on the menu, offer samples to guests to enrich their experience and collect immediate feedback. This will help you determine what's successful as the feedback process is flawed (not necessarily this location issue, but company wide issue)."}
{"text":"Like you standard Moxies type place but will more interesting cuisine. A Very large place but it fills up almost every night with people looking to relax and have a good time. The waitress staff are very friendly and attractive. They do wear the standard tight black clothing that has become the norm for this type of establishment. 

The food itself is very well made. A little on the exensive side but you get good quality for it. 

Overall, If you are a business man working downtown looking for a nice night out, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"You're only paying for the location, the food is mediocre at best! Also they don't even offer complimentary bread when you order soup, even if you ask for it. There are lots of beautiful family owned restaurants in Toronto that do a better job for the same price!"}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped in here on our last night of our Toronto trip.  This restaurant had the nicest staff out of any place I've been in Canada and also the US.  Our hostess sat us and asked us about where we were from and what we did on our trip. We had a conversation with her for a good 3-4 minutes.  Our server came and right away said \"my manager says you are from Pennsylvania and you're here visiting....  \"  Again, we had a 3-4 minute conversation.  I'm so not used to servers actually wanting to have a conversation, so it was weird, but a nice weird. 

My dad wanted wine with food so the person who gave us water asked if he wanted a wine tasting, to which he said yes.  4 glasses of wine came out and our server went over them all.  When the bill came, the wine tasting was complementary! 

As for food, my dad got the lobster grilled cheese which he loved and wants to try making at home because it was so good.   I got the butcher's sandwich which was basically a french dip and it was delicious.  When our server came with the check, he leaned down and had another conversation with us, telling us about where he was from and how he wants to move to the US someday and asking us more questions about where we live.  It was a really nice dining experience, a great way to end the last meal of our trip."}
{"text":"Well Joey, it looks like the third time is the charm afterall! 

 My previous visits had proven disasterous  what with inept/bimbo-fied service and near incontinental occurances of Gerard Depardieu-like proportions, so it was with much trepidation that I broached my third visit to Joey's. 

It certainly helps that I had the  pleasure of joining the Divine Miss Chris P and Yelper extrordinaire Karl \"Kool Kid\" R for some good ole noshery. Our plush surroundings of the spaciously leatheriffic booth was also a boon to our good spirits.  Hmmm, did they spike the air in here with oxygenated Spanish Fly or Ecstacy because everybody was looking muy caliente at Joey tonite including our stunningly efficient brunette server. Purrrrrrrrrrr.

We were in for some great eats as the charming Karl R ordered the Hi-Rise burger with skinny frites and the lovely Chris P had what looked like delicious mashed potato blintzes with grilled salmon.  I stuck to my fave Joey meal of the Baja fish tacos which is 3 palatable sized soft white corn shells filled with the perfect combination of fried fish/shrimps and tart guacamole and tomatoes with the spicy sauce on the side..just the way I like.

Along with our savoury dishes our discussions revolved around such erudite matters as strippers, birth order and why I am so attracted to hot gay men? I'm looking at you Tom Ford!

In the end it was a three way of major Yelptitude but before you get any lecherous ideas no, it was was not an ackward tangle of limbs and gonads, more like a lot of forking around fighting over the last tantalizing mouthfuls of dessert which in this case was an incredible rendition of Joey's apple pie with a sinful dollup of maple ice cream that melted languorously over the delicately buttery patisserie crust and crumbles of cinnamon and moist baked apples...some definite pie porn if you will.

 Kudos to Chris P and her geniousness for discovering a closer restroom and thus solving my previous bathroom grievance of trekking for miles while practicing your Kegels.  So it looks like you won't be needing the Depends to visit Joey's afterall!

Joey I tip my hat to you. Your sexy atmosphere, down to earth menu and restrooms within reach, have made me a happy girl.
I would give 5 stars had the child version of Joey Lawrence himself did a little tap dance number for me, but alas youtube can only provide me with this for my moment of zen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPRV7aoag4   \"Whoa!\""}
{"text":"If you are at Yonge and Dundas and you are sick of going to Jack Astors all the time and you don't mind spending a bit of cash you should definitely check this place out. This place is VERY popular and it is huge! We came here as a group of 4 on a friday night and the place was packed from top to bottom including the beautiful patio. The entrance are gigantic wooden doors making you feel like you're entering some sort of castle and the service I must say is one of the best in Toronto. The wait staff are extremely helpful and nice always asking to refill your drinks or helping you order something delicious. 

When we arrived there was a pretty long line and they took down our phone number and told us we would have to wait around 30-40 minutes. So we walked over to the beautiful LCBO to pick up some friday night booze and within 10 minutes they called us and told us they had a seat. This system was a lot better than the system at Jack Astor's where they give you a buzzer thing and you cannot move more than 10 feet from the restaurant since it would deactivate if you did. When we came back we had to wait a few more minutes at the door and they happily served us some water while we waited (genius!).

The inside was gorgeous decorated with dark colours complimented with beautiful lights and lovely comfortable couches. The bar had tons of TVs facing each direction so anybody could watch the game facing any direction. We were seated in a four-seater and I must say the tables were quite big. The noise level was pretty loud since it was really busy but there was no problem talking to each other. Even though it was very busy the wait staff did not seem rushed and were extremely friendly helping us choose what we wanted. I ordered a double crown burger, my friends ordered the maple salmon, lobster ravioli and the kobe beef spaghetti.

The food is not AMAZING but it is quite good. Since I do a lot of cooking myself of similar foods I like to compare food that I eat out with the stuff I make at home. 

DOUBLE CROWN BURGER - I was craving for a burger and boy was this a treat. It is essentially a cheese burger with jalepenos and hot sauce. The meat was juicy and the jalepenos and melted cheese gave a phenomenal flavour to the burger. This burger was not hot but it tasted great, the fries were standard if I remember correctly.

MAPLE SALMON - You can't really go wrong with salmon because it does not take much seasoning and you cannot overcook it that easily unlike steak. The salmon was decent, it was fully cooked (I would prefer it to be slightly undercooked so that it is softer) and you could really taste the maple. However, the asking price of $25 is definitely not worth a piece of salmon with maple butter. Nothing exceptional here.

LOBSTER RAVIOLI - This dish tasted great ( I only had a bit ) you could really taste the seafood but the portion was incredibly small for the $20, don't get this if you are a hungry man (like my friend was).

KOBE BEEF SPAGHETTI - The meatballs were apparently made with Kobe beef (for those who don't know it is very tender beef highly valued since only a few farms in japan raise kobe cows) but since meatballs are made with bread crumbs and a combination of other spices, the flavour is not very distinct. The meatballs tasted good but weren't exceptional (the kobe beef was probably slapped on there as an excuse to jack up the prices). Overall good flavour in the sauce and the beef.

All in all, this place does not have the most exceptional food (most likely because it IS a chain restaurant) but the food is not horrible, it's why this restaurant loses a star. However, the main reason why I love this place so much is the environment and the look and feel of the decor. The insides is amazing and when you walk by the patio and look inside you just WANT to check it out. Also, the service is FANTASTIC. If you are around this area and want a very nice and enjoyable dining experience (and don't want pickle barrel or jack astors) be sure to check this place out. Great service, great decor, and overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"#2 vs Earl's and Moxie's! Same busy atmosphere and decent food. Service is usually pretty good. Can't really go wrong here but usually very busy. 2 stars for food, 3 for drinking!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a pleasant late lunch here on Friday. Last time I tried to come here, there was a 40 minute wait for a table, but today we luckily we were immediately shown to a nice booth with a street view. We shared a bottle of the house wine, a red from France which at $30 was a reasonably good value. I tried the protein burger with fries. Skipping the carbs of the bun in favour of lettuce, I felt okay in eating my fries. They weren't my favourite fry I've had, but they were cooked well. The burger itself was really tasty. And our server was cute and efficient. I enjoyed the ambiance of the place too, and although the restaurant is huge, it didn't feel cavernous and unwelcoming to me. I'd definitely return for another meal."}
{"text":"We choose Joey as a central meeting spot for the most recent ladies' dinner. 

Walking in, I noticed the restaurant was super busy on a Thursday night and had it not been for our advance reservations, we would have been waiting quite awhile for a table.  We were seated a U-shaped booth for 6 people, which was an awkward configuration for chatting.  Also, the music was cranked and the general noise from other patrons and busy restaurant made it difficult to converse across the table.

I ordered the lobster grilled cheese with fries ($15.99) while others at the table ordered the bacon cheddar burger ($14.99), fish tacos ($13.49) and the chicken salad ($16.99).

I was super excited by the idea of the lobster grilled cheese but a little deflated after I had a bite.  The lobster was super fishy tasting...probably wasn't fresh lobster but it was still super stinky.  I wasn't a fan.  The rest of the girls enjoyed their food but felt that the side of sweet potato fries that accompanied the burgers were on the small side.

For dessert, we decided to split an order of the Italian donuts ($4.99).  The server mentioned that there were 6 portions so it was enough for us to have one each.

When the donuts arrived, we noticed that there were only 5.  I mentioned the missing donut to the person delivering the dessert (I think it may have been a manager or senior server) and she said she would fix that right away!  

We figured she would just bring us out one extra donut but a few moments later, she appeared with a full tray of 6 donuts, which she said were on the house!.  That's some great service and my love can always be bought with pastries.  

The donuts were the highlight of the meal...warm, deep fried little dough balls coated in sugar, sitting in a small pool of lemon curd.  Heavenly.  I'd go back for that dessert alone.

Just a note about the can - There are 2 unisex bathrooms on the main floor but to access more bathrooms, you have to go down 2 flights of stairs and down a long hall to the bathroom bunker."}
{"text":"I like Joey's.  The food is fine gastro pub fare and the staff are friendly.  My biggest beef is that they don't turn up the sound for sporting events on the many television monitors.  I understand the reason but still this means I don't go to Joey's for the BIG GAME."}
{"text":"Ambiance, service and food presentation are good, but the food and drinks are not good at all. Just a typical American/Canadian food. Nothing amazing about it. This is an example of a fancy restaurant, with expensive price but ordinary food."}
{"text":"I had lunch on the patio at Joey at the Eaton Centre today with a friend.  I was not disappointed with either the service and the food.  

As in places like Earls and South of Temperance, the servers are all attractive women wearing sky-high heels and short black mini dresses.  I thought I was in a Robert Palmer video shoot when I first walked in as they were all congregating around the hostess.  Clearly, this will be a big draw for the Bay Street crowd.  

My dining companion and I shared the Ahi Tuna Taco which were fabulous.  The sushi grade tuna was perfectly cooked.  There were four little tacos which came with a delicious sauce and were nicely presented.  

I had the Sangria (delish!) and the Panang Prawn Curry Bowl (nice pesentation).  My friend had the Viva salad which he really enjoyed as well.  

Loved the vibe and decor and the open feel of the restaurant.  I also liked that the servers kept bringing finger food to the table for us to try.  

Joey is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  I will definately be back."}
{"text":"Hard by the ghost of J.J. Muggs, occupying a stretch of Dundas just west of the more recently-deceased Sears flagship, JOEY Eaton Centre is clearly pitched to the tourist crowd. 

It's hard to find fault with the food; an Ahi Tuna Club arrives nicely seared, topped with bacon and onion rings, sweet-ass pepper spread on the side as requested. In lieu of the french fries that come on everyone else's plates, I score a minuscule caesar salad with three-count 'em croutons and a shake or two of parmesan cheese (note the spelling; Reggiano this ain't). 

Joey's menu is an ode to compromise. Tempura shrimp in tace form cozy next to bottom-feeding Basa bits in a bid to stretch the protein dollar. A fried chicken salad is pounded translucently thin, volume made up with arugula. A french dip sandwich is more substantial, but it's naked beef on a bun, for nearly $20. 

Mains strike a similarly discordant note; a seared Tuna salad is well-prepared but an awful lot of lettuce sided with minimal tuna and avocado. Chrimp curry looks great, but I remember the salt content and the rice more so than the few rubbery shrimp. 

And so I have figured out my issue with Joey's. Unlike it's West Coast competition (Earl's, Cactus Club Cafe), Joey's food falls just shy of its promised value. Staff in slinky black outfits, reclaimed wood, oversized booths and surprisingly decent music (who wouldn't want to listen to \"Psycho Killer\" over appies?) and frequent prodding to order drinks may come in a grade above the Pickle Barrel or Frans on the TOurist Trap scale, but Joey's is hardly representative of what our city has to offer."}
{"text":"So this will be a lengthy review because I've attached my complaint letter which I never received a response to. In short, I for spiritual reasons I was fasting from all meat and television for two months. During that time I was adhering to a vegetarian diet. My cousin rented out the lower level private dining area of joeys and they wouldn't accommodate my request for a vegetarian option other then salad at the fix price of 50 dollars. After a bunch of back and fourth the two other managers I was allowed to order off the vegetarian menu.  Overall the food at joeys is great but I would probably never come back to the Eaton center location. 



I contemplated whether or not I would write this email because the issue was resolved but the experience left such a bad taste in my mouth that I decided to follow through. On Saturday, July 18th 2016 I attended my cousins graduation celebration in the private lower level section of Joeys Eaton Centre. When reviewing the fixed-price menu I realized there was no vegetarian options (I acknowledge my cousin forgot to mention there were vegetarians in the party).  I approached Kristine and asked if there was anything that can be done and I apologize for the inconvenience. She explained that the restuarant operates two separate kitchens and everything is pre-prepared and my option would be to have the 500 salad without chicken. I went back to my seat and realized that for 50 dollars I would be eating a Caesar salad as an appetizer, a 500 salad as an entree and a desert. Realistically no one wants to eat two salads for 50 dollars. I approached her again and spoke to her about my option of eating two salads and she said again there is nothing she can do. I asked if I can go upstairs order something and bring it down she said no. I asked if they could just whip up a pasta she said no. I said I guess i will just have to not order anything and she just gave me a blank stare. Overall she seemed annoyed and when I was trying to talk to her she seemed reluctant as I had to call her a few times and she even made eye contact once and continued to walk away. I understand the vegetarian with all the questions is annoying but you work in hospitality and it comes with the job. So I went upstairs and explained the situation to Katie and said I don't mean to be a burden but can anything be done. She said normally they don't bring food downstairs but she understand and she's will discuss it with kristine. When she returned she explained that kristine said no and she is managing downstairs so there isn't much that she can do my only option is to eat upstairs (while my family eats downstairs). I want to make it clear that I have no issue with the service Katie provided because she was empathetic and gave me the impression that kristine has final say. So I said thanks for your help can I have a business card for your managers which she happily gave to me and apologized again. I went outside to walk around and see if I can grab a quick bite before everyone starts eating but I didn't see anything and returned. As I was walking back to the party I was approached by Sharyn Grewal, accompanied by Katie, she shook my hand  and introduced herself as the night time manager. She said I heard about the situation I want to apologize and get you something to eat. She did explain the two separate kitchens but said she could definitely make an exception. There was another vegetarian in the party so we gave our order to Sharyn directly and she brought our food down.  The amount of hoops I had to go through was a bit ridiculous. I understand you can't always bend the rules because it sets presidence for rules to be continuously bent. However, this is a restaurant and although there are two separate kitchens it is within the same building. This would have been the perfect opportunity to say hey we don't normally do that because of a,b and c but at joeys we wants our customers to leave happy so I will make an exception this one time. I would of left feeling extremely grateful and probably wrote a yelp review. Aside from food and atmosphere exceptional customer service is what gives restaurants a competitive edge. Sharyn is clearly a manager for a reason because she didn't come across as a pushover that will let everything slide and explained why things are done the way they are but she was apologetic and understating. 

Roughly a quarter of the guest that night all work/worked in food and hospitality ( the keg, chopped steakhouse, ect.) And they were not pleased with Kristine. They found her dismissive and I believe one of them even spoke to her about it. Initially when I arrived at joeys and saw the private dinning options I thought to myself I would definitely use this venue. However, after this experience I wouldn't until your entire staff is operating at the same level of customer service as Sharyn."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I only sampled one of their desserts: Italian Donuts (lemon curd & vanilla, mascarpone cream - $6). The donuts were fresh and tasty along with the lemon curd. The rest of the items on the menu are quite pricy, but I'm not surprised given the location of the restaurant. The hockey/football/baseball/soccer games blasting from flat-screen TVs create more of a pub-like atmosphere, as opposed to a place where one would want to take his date for a romantic dinner. The focal point of the restaurant's gotta be that giant window, which is kept open on warm summer days."}
{"text":"I was taking a client out to lunch and Joey Eaton Centre was the closest thing to her office, so we popped in at noon to check it out.

Service was great, lots of attractive ladies who appeared to have brains too! They were all very knowledgeable about the menu and friendly and attentive. 

I tried the Rotisserie chicken lunch ($16.99). The portion was huge for a lunch portion, a whole half chicken and it was cooked to perfection - very moist. I swapped the fries for a side salad and it also came with a coleslaw which was tasty.

The food selection here is kind of \"meh\", due to the location and typical clientele, looks like they are trying to keep the food kind of boring and safe. Lots of salads, wraps, burgers, steak, chicken, wings, etc. The food preparation and presentation is definitely a big step up from say, East Side Marios, but the menu lacks much creativity 

Joey Eaton Centre is swagged out with lots of fancy leather seats, but the bar area with flatscreen tvs playing hockey detracts from the ambiance for me. 

Good place to take less adventurous eaters!"}
{"text":"So I see 5 star and 4 star reviews, I suppose it is a california thing, but then again I gave their restaurant in Woodland Hills a 2 star too. This place isn't very good. Please go someplace this is really Canadian and this crappy american import (I am American so I can say that).  I so struggle with people that give this 5 stars, maybe they have not been someplace good.  One guy in my party go the sushi, it wasn't real sushi. I had a NY Steak that frankly sucked big time with a salad that was piss poor and the salmon bowl that was described as \"fish and small\".

Go someplace else, seriously, to expensive and mediocre to poor food."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends for dinner tonight and our waitress, Joanna was amazing!! She was very friendly and attentive.

She found out that one of our meal was not cooked to my friend's liking/request. She was so apologetic and asked whether we wanted to speak with the manager. The manager came right after and comp'd us 2 desserts for the inconvenience.

I ordered and love my Sashima Tuna Salad, it was so fresh and had perfect balance of flavors, and the tuna was cooked perfectly medium rare! My friend had the braised beef ribs which she really enjoyed and she said she'd order it again. As for the dish that got sent back was the steak cox it was not cooked medium but keep coming out as medium rare. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal that I would definitely go back!

When we asked for our check, that's when we found out that it was Joanna's first day as a waitress, she usually was one of the hostess. I personally can't say enough how great she was, if every restaurant I went to has such an attentive waitress that shows eagerness at what she does. It would be a win-win situation to the restauranteurs and customers."}
{"text":"I came to JOEY Eaton Centre today for lunch. We made last minute reservations and they were adamant that it was full but when we got there at 11:30 up to when we left at 2 pm the place was empty, so weird. Our waitress was nice and great with servicing us.  I've been to JOEY before and have been in love with their lobster grill cheese. Unfortunately this was taken off the menu.  We had the gyoza and spicy chilly chicken as an appetizer. For the mains I had the katsu salad with ginger sesame dressing and my 2 friends both had the fish tacos with fries.  They said the fish tacos were amazing. My salad was good too.  For dessert we shared he chocolate molten lava cake. That was yummy.  Overall the food was good but I wouldn't say it's amazing that I would give JOEY a 5 star.  But this is a nice place to go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, Joey fares decently.  The food is a bit pricey and over salted, but I guess that sells more beer?  

On a most recent visit I had their CHANTRELLE MUSHROOM SOUP.  It was rich and mushroomy and a tad over salted.  The French dip is a comforting messy roll filled with beef with a nice hot gravy to dip it in.  They have a decent bar with good beer selection and pricey cocktails.

And if nobody has said it, the boys come here to gawk at the sexy waitresses in their short black dresses.  This trend is an interesting one and more than once people have referred to the trend as the \"upscale Hooters\" trend."}
{"text":"Despite visiting this restaurant with a large group of my friends (15 people) and having no reservation, the waiters and waitresses were able to accommodate our group and provide exceptional customer service. They were also very friendly and easy to talk to. Food was well made and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome. 

The szechuan edamame was great. My teenager loved his sushi cone & lobster grilled cheese as much as I loved my ahi tacos.

great location, atmosphere and food. 

Added surprise: They made a mistake timing our appetizers and we weren't really upset and didn't complain but the manager came to our table, apologized and comped them! I would have normally given this restaurant 4 stars but the added service makes them a 5 in my book."}
{"text":"food = 5/5
service = 5/5

When food and service are impeccable, there's not much to be said for anything else even if the food here is a tad on the pricey side.

For a while, I actually thought this place was Joel Robuchon's commercial retail establishment, but it turns out to be a chain restaurant that started out in BC--which makes the unique and original menu even more surprising. 

Sushi Cones (handrolls) with soy wrapping as opposed to seaweed.
Morrocan chicken on a bed of couscous
Flavourfully marinated steak
Wild mushroom soup with hints of balsamic vinaigrette. 

Ok so you're going to have to pay about $30-$50/person but the food is worth it.
Their gorgeous servers are super friendly and extremely helpful. We were there for a party of 10 that expanded to 15 and they had no problems accommodating us and switching our seats while being extremely friendly.

They have very limited tables that are reserved for reservations, so if you didn't book a few weeks early, they will likely be taken. However, if you go there an hour to an hour and half early to put your name down for a large group, you are free to wander around the mall until they call you. PERFECT! 

The only catch about the restaurant is their bathroom. They have one on the first floor but the line is long because their other one is a million km walk in the basement (tho beautiful the entire way there). They do have signs that tell you how many metres before you get there, but nonetheless you should still go before you need to go.

Oh and large TVs around the bar and a beautiful patio against Dundas for people watching in the summer is just icing on top of an already delicious cake."}
{"text":"The mushroom soup was excellent as was the Ahi Tuna Club.  This was a lunchtime visit and the noise was enough to nullify any conversation.

Will be back but off hours only!"}
{"text":"Dined at Joey's for the first time last night. My boyfriend and I started with a drink each: a rye and ginger for him and an old fashioned for me. He got the ravioli and I got the Spanish paella. 

I avoided dining at Joey's for the longest time after a bad experience at another location, but this one at the Eaton centre was great. The drinks were delicious, and the food was even better. A little bit saltier than I would prefer, but still amazing! Service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was lively and welcoming.

Two mains and two drinks rounded up to around $75 before tip. 

Definitely will be back again for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food. 
Excellent service, they really work hard to make their customers content. I went during their peak hours with a group of 5 and was said that we had a 45 minute wait but we got a table after 30 minutes. Everyone was pleased with their food and service, would come back!"}
{"text":"Just ate there with my mom. The food was perfect and the waiter we had was extremely friendly. I 100% recommend their apple pie with maple ice cream for a dessert. Still don't know where it was coming from but there was heat coming from under the table i presume which was very nice since it was a bit chilly. Overall my experience was better than I expected and I would definitely come here again or bring people here who have never been in the city. Also found it surprising that as soon as I finished my iced tea the waiter was right there ready to bring a refill! A good environment for a casual or professional dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I had butter chicken with homemade Naan.  My husband had pasta pomadora.  
   For dessert, we had apple pie.  5 stars.
Great coffee too.  I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Just went for lunch, and we could not have been happier with our choice. We were seated by very nice hostesses, and were taken care of by Kyle, who was an amazing server. He was well versed and very polite, and even asked if either of us had food allergies. Both of us got steak meals, which made our visit even better. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Joey Eaton is in a great Location at Yonge and Dundas close to everything and anything.

Drop by with my Yelp Drinking Buddy for a late night drink. I do appreciate that Joey has a drink special everyday. The food though I find a little boring and pricey.

Cheeseburger Sliders ($11.49)
- Mini cheeseburger? not bad? not good?

Baja Fish Taco ($13.49)
- diced deep fried fish and shrimp
- not memorable... not going to order again... 

Services was nice and pleasant but we just could not get our bill... Our waitress was busy with other tables and never came back to check on us.. all we want to do was pay and leave!

Joey is OK... If you are a sport fan. I don't mind watching a game or two with my friends but I definitely don't want to go on a date at Joey... ever. 

Will I be back? Maybe for a drink when I am in the area, But would not be wearing my Little Black Dress to any Joey's location ever!!"}
{"text":"I just love coming here after work for drinks and food. I give it 5 stars for being what it is and doing it well. A great vibe at Joey's, food is always decent and good selection of drinks on the menu. More importantly, always get impeccable service when coming here from the wait staff which is most appreciated."}
{"text":"Server was the best! She was expert on food explanation, she said her boyfriend also worked here as chef. Amazing food! Was here for a retirement party, and we had the best food and drink!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot when in Toronto. I haven't had a bad thing in the menu and staff is great as well"}
{"text":"Their food was pretty good. I still have cravings for the lettuce wraps. However the servers are terrible. I ordered my drink, and it never came. I had to order it 2 more times with 2 different people before it finally arrived. And our food took forever to come. I know it takes time for good food but it shouldn't take that long."}
{"text":"Average food, model looking staff. Not worth the price tag!"}
{"text":"I visited Joey's on a Saturday night (around 8pm), there was a bit of a line up for tables so good thing we reserved a table ahead of time. This location is right off the subway line, attached to the Eaton Centre but you have to enter from outside. 

The menu has many options to chose from, it was hard to pick just one thing. There are Indian, Japanese and American options. 

We had the Chicken Souvlaki Sandwich, Steak and Mushroom Demi and for dessert Molten Lava Chocolate Souffle. The Chicken Souvlaki was great, good portion and the chicken had flavour and tender. The steak was a smaller than expected size but the mashed potatoes that came with it was good. The Souffle was amazing! It was just the right amount of chocolate and sweet. 

There are business-casual elements with a full bar and TVs showing games but I also like that there is potential for an intimate setting without TVs pointing at you every direction. 


I would come back to Joey's to try more of there menu and for the Souffle!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice and they have a few great street side seats where you can just people watch your entire dinner. The food however is nothing special. We got the chili chicken and the calamari shareable. It's certainly not bad but it also wasn't that great considering the prices. It just tasted like your regular pub food. I guess you really pay for the location and atmosphere. The service was alright as well."}
{"text":"I went with quite a large group and the restaurant was able to accommodate and seat us within 15 minutes on a Saturday night. The ambiance and the night was quite nice, very dimmed and a very young crowd. The servers were very nice, polite and willing to tell me about their day and other things.

The food was quite good (but the portions were a bit small). I ordered a Spanish Paella which had lobster saffron broth, shrimp, smoked chorizo, chicken, rice. It was probably the best paella I had had in a while and my mouth was drooling, it was so damn good and perfectly cooked. 

I then ordered molten chocolate cake and it was done well. It was hot and gooey with delicious vanilla ice cream on the side.  

Would definitely come again with my friends, but maybe sit at the bar next time."}
{"text":"It's the little things that make this Yonge and Dundas location seem so enormous. Like when you first feel the blast of A/C pouring out of their wide-open windows, and you feel like you're about to hug a glacier. Or the moment when you give their castle-worthy front doors a tug, and it makes you feel like an axe-wielding dwarf. Or the fact that it's really fucking big inside.

When we entered, we were greeted by no less than a half-dozen hostesses. If you and your be-suited work buddies are looking for the nearest food hole that has an \"eye-candy\" checkbox on their application form, look no further.

Anyway, the group of friends we were joining were already stuffed into a too-full booth downstairs, so we took a seat upstairs at the bar. Joey is a pretty stunning space I must admit, and our server was amiable, friendly and very accommodating.

Food-wise there is WAY TOO MUCH on their menu, but I was able to pick out a Beach Salad from the offerings. It was strawberries, goat cheese, quinoa, candied pecans, lemon poppy dressing and grilled chicken. At $16.49 this is an expensive salad, but it's a filling portion.

They have an Enomatic machine here, so that alone is reason to get excited. Wines by the glass! And they have a pretty good selection of wines from California and Australia.

I try not to dine anywhere near this intersection, but if I must, Joey isn't a bad option.

Obligatory Title Pun: This JOE does not blow.

Menu Readability: Decently laid out, but could use a few thousand fewer options.

Need to mention: They have drink specials every day.

What this place teaches me about myself: Yeah, I ordered \"just a salad.\" I'm that guy."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with my boyfriend. Loved the atmosphere! He called in advance to reserve seats, however upon arrival, we still had to wait around 10-15 minutes to be seated. 

The food was amazing, I personally love the food here. However, they can improve their service. The service was a bit slow, however our food was amazing. The waitress even brang out a surprise dessert, which read out \"Happy Birthday,\" which was so cute! 

Overall, experience was good. I probably wouldn't come here if I'm starving, because the service is slow!"}
{"text":"I had no complaints about the food, because honestly everything tasted pretty good. The service, however, was quite slow - there were several moments where my friends and I would be looking around the restaurant and trying to get our server's attention. The longest \"break\" of service was when we were waiting for our change after paying for the food. We waited approximately 15 minutes, while our server dallied by the bar, chatting and laughing with the bartender. Overall, I would recommend going to Joey's only when you have time to spare and aren't in the rush to get somewhere!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Slightly on the pricey side but worth the splurge. The crowd is fun and lively. The staff is extremity nice. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

I think the sizes of their burgers are huuggeee. So if you want to save some money, you can share a burger with someone. The appetizers are good too. I ordered the calamari and it came in a towering plate full. When it comes to the desserts, you'll hv to try the molten chocolate lava cake. Of course it comes warm and the inside is oozing out!!

Joeys dt is huge and provides ample space to host your party. The upstairs is a bit more intimate and hv a bar area to serve you. Downstairs during the summer time, the windows open up so you can enjoy watching ppl walk by while you enjoy your drink or dinner. 

Menu prices would be $$ (two dollar signs) and it's comparable to moxies or earls!

LAST TIP?!

if your party is six or more, be prepared to be added 18% gratuities automatically! Go during super happy hour to save some money! 3-6 and 9-close from Sun-Thurs. Apps will be $3.5 and drinks are $4!!!"}
{"text":"Looking north on street level at Dundas it features floor to ceiling windows that open on nicer days. Lauding itself as an \"upscale casual\" restaurant the place was styled in the heavy dark wood tones that have been so popular in restaurant design for the past decade. The dark tones suggest a nightclub atmosphere which is mirrored in how the servers and staff are dressed and styled. You are led through a maze of tables and banquettes, some of which line the north facing windows into a cave like atmosphere that feels heavy and oppressive. The style reminded me of over upscale diner's, like Earl's stressing style over substance. The place emphasized that dining was like a nightclub, an experience to be savoured. Sadly, the limited menu was overpriced for what was served. But we seemed to be the only ones unimpressed with the food and the experience. Everyone else enjoyed the atmosphere as the place was packed with shoppers, tourists and workers seeking respite after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Their French Dip was amazing! Excellent customer service. They kept giving us sample treats while we waited for a seat. My new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times already.
The food is really good! The steak and sushi is absolutely amazing
The salad with hazelnuts and strawberries in it is so good!
I love the pim's cup there too
The service is very nice. The manager even came to check if we enjoyed their new dish.
Also they have big screens. Perfect for watching games"}
{"text":"There's a new spot around the popular Yonge and Dunas area for after work drinks, dinners or last minute meet ups. Joey is a popular chain that's found in multiple cities across Canada. Its located along Dundas and situated right beside Ryerson's Ted Rogers School of Business. So it can definitely be a choice for young budding students who might be meeting up for student gatherings, celebrating victories over projects or exams.

I came here for after work drinks to meet up with some coworkers after over a month of intense project work. The wait at 6pm was still 30 mins on a tues. So this place isn't just conveniently located but popular. What's nice was while waiting they give you wine samples to try out. They provided a simple chardonny which wasn't bad. The entrance door is massive so it definitely gives you that sense of grandness as you enter. The whole place is nicely decorated in a modern and chic fashion. The place looks great and the patio was what we wanted. They have these nice plush booths with a great city street view along Dundas. What's there to not like?

We got a few drinks while we tried to digest the large menu, I went with a sleeve of Keith's Indian Pale Ale which was the special that night. After much discussion and recommendation from the very friendly waitress, our group took those recommendations to heart. I went what the suggested lobster ravioli. I was quite torn as I felt like a burger that day, but friend said it didn't taste that good at all. He said, how can you mess up a burger? Lol, I was very much tempted to explain, but I'll save it for another day. =)

The food took about less than 20 minutes to come out which is pretty quick for a restaurant of this size and supposed calibre. The lobster ravioli tasted fresh and I liked the lemon dill cream sauce. It was simple and pretty light. My only gripe would be it didn't fill you. And it wasn't like every bite was filled with lobster but it was satisfying so keep that in mind when coming. My friend liked it too but somehow his rating went lower as the night went on. I know I liked it and wouldn't mind ordering it again if I was in the mood for pasta. The menu is pretty extensive, so I know I would try another dish when I can back.

Overall, I liked Joey. It's a good looking restaurant in a great location and tho it is more expensive, it's not the worst choice you can make around Yonge and Dundas. Could you try out Woo if you want more food, definitely. I mean I haven't even tried it out either so why not right? But Joey is a happening place with a patio that I really enjoyed. So I'll be back, for drinks indefinitely. And for food? Sure why not. How did you like the food at Joey's? Or is it more of a drinking grounds for you?"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere.  Braised Ribs were awesome!  Service was very good.  Highly recommended.  Slightly off the beaten path... Which is good on busy weekends."}
{"text":"Pepper corn New York steak was great, great service as well.

There was a special on a Canadian beer that is the supposedly equivalent to Corona. It was indeed good and refreshing.

The place is nice, not too loud even though there are TV's everywhere.

Update May 2014: returned there TWICE in two days. Still very good."}
{"text":"I've been working in the building next door for over a year but just visited JOEY for the first time this month for lunch with my work team. The eight of us were greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne when we walked through the doors and were seated quickly despite not having a reservation. I didn't get a good look at the tables here to see what group sizes they can accommodate, but it seemed like most groups were between 2-4 people. We were a little cramped at our round booth in the back. One of my co-workers sat on a stool grabbed from another table which clearly has a different height because he had to hunch over to eat his meal. If you're coming with a group larger than 6, definitely make a reservation so your seating arrangement isn't as awkward as ours was :) 

I ordered the yellowfin tuna salad which was fresh, flavorful and filling (alliterations, woohoo!) -- I'm always surprised when I'm full from a salad. Tuna was seared perfectly, and I loved the additions of mango and crispy noodles. The only qualm I had was that there was a little too much dressing. 

Service was friendly and efficient. Probably not be my first choice with so many great options within walking distance, but JOEY is a dependable spot for a solid work lunch in the Yonge-Dundas area."}
{"text":"If you want a nice big juicy steak, this is the place to get it. I ordered the New York steak with Blue Cheese butter on the top. Every bite I took, I felt like I was in heaven. Get the Jam Fries with plenty of Garlic Aioli for starters. If you have room for dessert, I suggest the Chocolate Lava Cake. Once you start it, the chocolate keeps going until every bite is gone. Food is amazing and service is excellent. We had Janelle as our waitress and she was on top of everything. She didn't keep us dry in our drinks. Place is a sports bar with some class to it. If you just want dinner without the TV/Sports, they have an area for that. Love this place."}
{"text":"I came here to try the fish tacos on the recommendation of a friend.

The ambience is nice, the decor is nice, the vibe is youthful and trendy, but other than that, the experience was only so-so.  I came in on a rainy evening alone, meaning to just get in and get out quickly.  As soon as I told my server I was just there for a quick dinner, he abandoned me and got various bartenders to serve me instead, which wasn't great.

The fish tacos were okay but all the seafood in it - both the fish and the shrimp - were fried, and the portions were on the smaller side.  Seven Lives is better and, because of the portions, cheaper in comparison.  I will continue to get my seafood taco fix at Seven Lives!

Another time I was here, I found the pasta to be bland and overcooked and the flatbread to be heavy and oily.  So 3 stars for the okay fish tacos and nice decor."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambience, a good fusion of flavours and good locations. I went with a birthday party of about 12 people and the booths were well accommodating for the large party. A must try are their sushi cones, sliders and my personal favourite the ahi taco!"}
{"text":"Before I start off my review, I actually would rate Joey's a 3.5 but Yelp doesn't give me that option. 

I was really excited to try out Joey's after reading the great reviews on Yelp.  I guess I had my expectations set too high because I wasn't blown away. As I was about to enter the restaurant I somehow opened the door on my foot -____- and cut my foot in 3 places...yay =(!

Me and my sister waited less than half an hour for a table without reservations on a Saturday night...which is pretty good wait time for a weekend. What makes Joey's different from other restaurants is that while you wait they offer you wine and food samples. I even asked for bandaids (since my foot was bleeding) and the hostesses gave me alcohol wipes and plenty of bandaids =)...now that's what I call hospitality!

I ordered the killer ahi tuna tacos and lobster ravioli while my sister ordered BC halibut and prawn spaghettini. I wasn't planning on getting the tacos but after suggestions from Yelp I gave it a shot. I didn't like it at all..just not my cup of tea. The lobster ravioli came out fresh and hot and it was yummy. My sister's spaghettini had too much garlic in it because just from one bite you could taste how strong it is. 

So if you're ever downtown, stop going to Jack Astor's all the time and try out Joey's instead. The prices are reasonable and just a few dollars more you can eat tastier food than what they serve at Jack Astor's. I would definitely drop by Joey's again and try something else. I guess the food wasn't spectacular enough for me to give it a 4."}
{"text":"The best part of this place was the fun and exciting labyrinth you have to go through to find the washroom (the one at the back).  It was fun and took about 25 minutes to reach the final destination.   1 star for that.  Maybe I found it fun due to the free wine mentioned below?

The atmosphere here was pretty good, hence the 2 - stars...we had to wait a long time to get a table but they gave us free wine which is pretty awesome by my standards.  1 star for that.

I had a hamburger which destroyed my stomach in the worst ways.... minus a billion points for that.

I don't know if I did that math right, but I haven't returned to Joey for fear of dying in agony next time.

*Note to kitchen staff, cook your burgers before feeding them to people!"}
{"text":"First visit ever at this chain.  Great atmosphere & service however food was although tasty did not meet my expectations.  Went before a show & we told waiter that & he was very accommodating & ensured we were served promptly.  Ordered spinach artichoke dip with nachos & tasted good however very small portion to share with 4 people.  Kids ordered linguini Alfredo and lobster grilled cheese & they loved it. I ordered ravioli florentine which had scallops & there were small scallops, not a lot on it.  My guy ordered butter chicken & unfortunately rice & naan was very cold. He told waiter & he was great & said would get him another order. Within 5 minutes a manager came to see us to apologize (even though we didn't make a big deal about it) & said she talked to chef to get it rectified & even said she would take it out of our bill.  Great service & staff.       Unfortunately when the new butter chicken came, rice & naan was still cold but we didn't complain as didn't want to be difficult & we had to go to see the show.  Overall, great staff but some misses with food.  I will give it 1 more try & order different things based in great staff...want to give them another chance."}
{"text":"The food here is good but definitely not worth what they charge for it. Also my portion was rather small; I had the lobster ravioli and was still pretty hungry when I was finished. Did I mention that the food is overpriced? That's the one thing I just can't get over about Joey's. I had lobster ravioli and a beer and my bill was $31. My opinion? Unless you've never been before save your money and go to one of the similar restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Okay food. Pleasant waiters. Went there after work last night. The service was quick and the waiter seemed really helpful while I was making a choice. Not many vegetarian options though so people like me may want to give this a miss. 

I'd go again only if not for the lack of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Now that I work across the street, I have by Joey's numerous times for an after work drink. The customer service here is fantastic, and I hope it stays that way. Every employee I talk to here is so friendly and nice. Makes all the difference. Well done."}
{"text":"I came here with my cousins and my sister as a sort of goodbye dinner before we left for the States. We came on a Monday night, and there was no wait, which was great.

To drink, I had the Pomegranate Mojito. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. It actually didn't taste much like a mojito. It kind of just tasted like pomegranate juice with a little liquor. We had the Szechuan Edamame and the Spinach & Artichoke Dip as our appetizers, which were both were amazing. The edamame was interesting, as I've never had it any other way but with salt. I ordered the Grilled Salmon, which I really enjoyed. When I got my plate, I wondered where my mashed potatoes were because it said it was served with some on the menu. The thing I didn't know is that it was served in an spring roll shell! What?! I don't know how common this is, but I've never seen it before, and it was pretty delicious. The sauce for my salmon was nice and light; I finished my plate. For dessert, we ordered the Molten Lava Chocolate Soufflé. There is just something about warm and cold desserts that I absolutely love, and this one did not disappoint. The raspberry coulis really took this dessert up a notch. It tasted like dark chocolate and raspberry truffles. Delicious!

Our server was very nice. She joked around with us a little, which was great, because I'm not a big fan of uptight servers. She checked up on us often, but she didn't hover.

I would definitely like to come back here when I'm in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"This is a definite go to if your in the yonge and dundas area or need a meal after shopping around the Eaton Centre.
And its NOT located inside of the Eaton Centre ( I learned this the hard way) Its outside on Dundas.
The restaurant itself is beautiful, dim lighting, modern and sleek decor, tv surrounding the central bar, and cozy booths and tables. We came around 6pm and though it was a Tuesday evening the restaurant was surprisingly packed, mostly with a lot of suits and business people.
However we warmly welcomed by the hostess and promptly seated no wait time!
Our waitress Mariya was sooo helpful, attentive, and cheerful, she was consistently wiping down our table of any spills and helped us make selections.

For drinks my sister and I were craving strawberry lemonade however they only had regular lemonade however our waitress said don't worry Ill whip you guys up one, and she got the bartender to add fresh strawberry puree to our lemonade! It tasted great, just what we were looking for!!

For apps we ordered the Cheeserbugers sliders - three mini burgers with secret sauce and melted american cheese and pickles.
They were really good, nice bun, perfectly cooked meat, held together well, no complaints!

For my main I had to get the Killer Ahi Tuna Tacos - seared rare with sesame ginger coleslaw and wasabi-lime aioli. These were sooo yummy, very flavourful, tuna cooked and seasoned perfectly in the a crunchy shell. Just delicious!
My sister ordered the Bombay Butter Chicken - served with toasted almond basmati rice, grilled naan bread and lentil papadum. She said it was also good but the curry tasted too tomatoey.

Finally for dessert Molten Lava Chocolate Souffle - rich dark chocolate cake outside, soft molten lava centre and ice cream and a raspberry sauce. We also ordered tea but they no black tea or orange peoke so we settled for chai which was pretty good anyhow.

The souffle was amazzingg so decadent! Crispy on the outside and ooozing warm rich lush on the inside. I also really enjoyed the raspberry sauce too it completed the chocolate really well.

Overall really lively restaurant, great service, and good food!!!!

FYI the bathrooms are located downstairs really far away, you have to go to the back of the restaurant by the kitchen beside the elevator, go down a flight of stairs, down a hall, another flight of stairs, another hall and then you finally arrive. There are funny signs along the way counting down the metres to the bathroom however when you finally get there they are really fabulous!!"}
