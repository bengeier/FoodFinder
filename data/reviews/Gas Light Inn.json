{"text":"I loved this place. I can't wait to come back. The breakfast was delicious.  The decor is amazing.  You feel like your in a different time period ."}
{"text":"I've had the absolute best stay at this bed and breakfast. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable. I had nice fluffy towels. It was very quiet and peaceful. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. You get complimentary breakfast every morning and it was delicious. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to visit Please come to the Gaslight Inn. The owner Teresa is amazing. I really enjoyed my stay, I hate to give up the keys"}
{"text":"We LOVED our stay at Gas Light Inn. The beds are SO comfy, really nice clean rooms, nice furniture, and TVs too. Upon walking in we were greeted by the very friendly owners who made us feel right at home. We relaxed in their awesome little wine bar over a nice glass of vino (the owners know their stuff on wine) and enjoyed the live entertainment. We enjoyed our homemade yummy breakfast in the outdoor patio. This is a beautiful place to come and relax and have some drinks. Awesome service and food, highly recommend it. I hope to go back soon :)   Thanks again for an awesome stay Gas Light Inn!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place randomly and are very impressed! This place is quaint, friendly clean and comfortable! On a quiet downtown street with little evening traffic and no outside noises. We went for a late evening walk outside before retiring and found the streets safe and peaceful to walk for for blocks. The breakfast was fabulous.  If we ever return to Glendale this will our choice of our place to stay. Thank you Theresa."}
{"text":"Great facility!  I have stayed here several times since they re-opened.  After numerous frustrating stays at chain-motels (that charge the same or more per night) I was so happy to find this quaint little boutique hotel.    The rooms are beautifully appointed, clean, and surprisingly quiet.  I love the old-town ambiance paired with brand new firm mattresses, plush pillows, large flat screen TV, and modern bathrooms.    I am so grateful for the gluten-free food options and personalized, special attention provided by the staff during every visit.   It is also an enormous relief to have great espresso in Phoenix - right in the lobby!  And, the wine bar features a broad selection of great wines."}
{"text":"What a great little gem of a place to stay!  Had originally had a reservation for two, but that didn't pan out, so I was about to cancel my reservation.  I am so glad I didn't!    Felt like I was a part of the family as soon as I walked in the door and it only got better.  Danielle the receptionist and Teresa the owner were great to work with and made the experience so much better!  Interesting little shops close by and there is no lack of local flavor to enjoy.  Right next door to a great little German restaurant that is as authentic as I have ever been to.    I stayed a few days before their regular open season, but everything was spot on and this was a tremendously good experience.  Will definitely make a reservation here if I'm ever this way again.  I only experienced one night, but this was a great place!"}
{"text":"We just had the best time at the Gas Light Inn... we spent two very restful nights in our \"Presidential Suite\"; ate more than enough at breakfast, and were happy to be among the first to enjoy the OTG patio!  The staff were very friendly- and our hosts were just the best- making sure all details for a guest's stay were taken care of.  We truly enjoyed the historic neighborhood and also other sites in Phoenix- while taking in a Padres game (which is why we came in the first place).  Location is GREAT and we highly recommend you make plans to stay at the Gas Light Inn.  We'll be back as we want to enjoy the live entertainment as well as continue to see the enhancements of the Inn that are being planned.  Thanks again to Teresa and Pete- your Bonita guests- Tom and Linda"}
{"text":"I can't review the actual inn. My review is based on their customer service. I had to cancel my reservation due to a change in plans. I called three weeks before the reserved date. They apparently have a no refunds policy and strictly enforce it. I was unaware of the policy at the time of booking, but I see other reviewers have had similar experiences. I should have read all the reviews.  I do understand that they may feel they need to charge a fee for their inconvenience, but they charge the entire amount of the room for the night. I don't feel this is a fair policy or good customer service. Particularly when given three weeks notice to find another occupant. Very disappointed and out $150.  PLEASE MAKE SURE OF YOUR PLANS BEFORE BOOKING!!!"}
{"text":"love staying at the Gas Light Inn, switched from staying at the other hotels close to the stadium. Gaslight Inn is a much better place to stay. Homemade breakfast, clean and comfortable. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"Our wedding was last weekend and what an amazing event.  Gas Light Inn made it perfect for our guests.  They all had a great night sleep with the top of the line bed, the gourmet breakfasts that come with the rooms and old town feel.  We were able to get some much needed time with all the family members that I have not seen in many years. They were so kind to be able to give us enough room to spread out and meet and greet everyone.    I will have to say the honeymoon suite was the best.  The room was GORGEOUS!! It was romantic, roomy and had a perfect view of Glendale glitters. Beautifully restored and looked after.  It has amazing furniture, fixtures, hardwood floor.  It also has His and Her toilets, mirrors, appliances and a kitchen. My husband and I plan to make it a tradition to come back every year.  Thank you for making this event so special to the us!    We found this place through our wedding planner and what a find.  We first saw it late in July one night.  We met Chad in the bar and he was so kind to give us a grand tour.  I fell in love right there.  I got chills because it was too perfect for words.  We got to see all rooms and hear the ghost story of room 111.  It had history and character and I knew my guest would love it too."}
{"text":"Best Kale salad I have had in ages with pistachios, raise and feta. My husband has the tuna salad panani and the Murphy's Stout. He thoroughly loved them  both. Very congenial and helpful waitress. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We have stayed at many Bed & Breakfast's over the years and this one is by far our favorite!  The attention to detail, the top notch service and OMG the breakfast!  I will stay here again!    Every room has it's own bath.  Each room is very nicely appointed.  While the historic nature of the place comes through clearly, the steps don't squeak.  Teresa is a great hostess and chef.  She and husband Peter really work hard to ensure a great stay.  Breakfast was really special and delicious.  We ate dinner at their new restaurant, the Desert Rose Steakhouse, and it was also fantastic.  The OTG Wine Bar also has some unique beers and wines.    We will stay here again."}
{"text":"We stayed at the GL for over three weeks due to a family emergency.  We were treated like family by everyone who worked there, especially the owner, Teresa.  The bedding is 5 star and the hot breakfasts are gourmet and  healthy and filling.  We were shown much care and kindness for the duration of our stay.  Place is very clean and very hospitable.  We will return in May of this year, for a happier reason."}
{"text":"Don't book here it's a ripoff. Called at least ten times and they're either closed or they just don't return or answer their phone. Bumped their review up to two star from one. They returned our calls and said they were closed during the summer, but really is that good for business. Keep you posted!"}
{"text":"This was such a great find!  We came to Phoenix for Spring Training and my wife found this place.  Clean, comfortable, super friendly staff, delicious cookies every night, hearty breakfast every morning, all included in the price.  Kind of a cross between a B&B and a hotel, but not sterile like a hotel and no nosey B&B owners (not that they all are, but it happens!). It was fun to just roam around after hours, hang out in the lobby or the roof top terrace.  The AC was awesome (a must in AZ), too.  Just kind of felt like home away from home.  We plan to stay again next spring!  Thanks Teresa!"}
{"text":"Worst tea experience of my life.   I am not a novice when it comes to afternoon tea, so I know what I am talking about. This place is trying, but it fails to provide a quality experience.   My sister called to make reservations and was told that a gluten free tea service was available. She was ensured that sandwiches and scones would be available. She even called a second time to make sure. When we sat down, the first thing I told the server was that I was the gluten free tea service. The server didn't know what gluten free was.   The gluten free bread for the sandwiches was hard and soggy at the same time. It was clearly frozen for some time, as ice crystals had formed. When the bread defrosted, the top of the crust was left wet and the sandwiches were clearly made ahead of time as they cream cheese was cracked around the edges and the bread was so hard I had to remove the cucumbers and only eat those.   When the scones came out, I asked if they were gluten free since they all looked the same and did not look gluten free. They also came out with \"cream\" for the scones. Pretty sure the cream was from a can of redi-whip. I never got to try it because they were never able to find the gluten free scones. Even after waiting for at least 15 minutes.   My gluten eating sister was not happy with her tea service either.   For $25 a piece we were basically forced to choose the same pot of loose leaf tea or to use an individual tea bag with no pot. Say what?!  With this horribly lacking service, I thought we should get a discount. Nope.   My sister thought we shouldn't have left a tip since the server was lacking in knowledge and if I were a true celiac I could have gotten very sick from eating at this place.   With all that said, this place does not have the ambiance of a tea room. The hats were fun, but the rest of the experience was not. We were the ONLY people in there for tea. I have NEVER been to a tea room on any day of the week with no other customers.   I do not recommend this place for afternoon tea nor do I recommend it as a safe location for those that want to stay safe from gluten.   Definitely skip. Sorry, Gas Light."}
{"text":"I went with a group during Glendale Glitters and just wanted to grab a bite to eat. It was a little late and they didn't have a lot of things still available on the menu so we ordered a meat and cheese board for the table and it was phenomenal. So it definitely made up for the fact that there was barely anything we could order off the menu. I assumed it was because of the festival and all the customers they had throughout the night that a lot of the food just ran out. Our server Danielle was really sweet, there weren't many people in the restaurant when we came in and she seemed rushed but she definitely loosened up and was super nice and very patient with us. They closed at 10 and we didn't leave until around 10:45pm, and we were never rushed out or felt unwanted. It was a very pleasant experience with some yummy food."}
{"text":"Don't go for High Tea. Although the food was good the experience leaves a lot to be desired. This falls back on the service. Our server was also the bartender and I think if I would have been there with friends for drinks would have been okay. But took my mother in law (84) and 2 of her sisters, not quite what was expected. At least we could laugh about it."}
{"text":"The Gaslight is NOT closed, been open for awhile but now they have a full bar, not just beer and wine. Enjoyed the evening sitting outside watching and listening to Haus Murphy's Oktoberfest next door, and no cover charge! Great wine and beer selection, and got a brat to enjoy the polka music."}
{"text":"Great place to stay when visiting relatives!  Rather than stay with my sister while visiting last week,  I decided to stay the 3 nights somewhere close to her and  this was the closest  and very reasonable.  It is in  Old Towne Glendale near shops, antiques, great food, and the Inn  was perfect and created a wonderful experience for my visit - not something I expected.    A few items specifically: extremely reasonable rates, which includes a full breakfast; very clean and well maintained; excellent service by the staff; Teresa, one of the owners was extremely hospitable; the bed and pillows were very comfortable and good quality (important to me!); the breakfast was made to order with 3 selections to choose from each morning; next door is the OTG Wine Bar (owned by the same), which was great to stop in and enjoy a glass of wine after visiting the family and before turning in.  I was traveling alone and felt very safe (the inn-keeper is on premises all night).   I had a delightful visit - saw family during the day, and had some privacy and explored the area in the mornings and evenings.  I'd recommend this Inn highly if you want a unique experience.  I tire of sterile (and far more expensive), chain hotels and really enjoyed the individual personality of the Gas Light Inn.   I stayed downstairs in one of the lesser expensive rooms, but after Teresa showed me the upstairs suites and rooms, I would absolutely opt for upstairs and a little more money (not a lot though) next time.  The downstairs back room I stayed in (The Gala) was well furnished (all  rooms with antiques), and was quiet on the alley, but because of being on the alley don't really have a window (a glass block windoes does create some light but maintains privacy).  The upstairs rooms had windows, were more spacious and beautifully furnished.  Frequently website pictures look better than the real thing - I actually found the reverse here.  I think the rooms (including mine), look better than the pictures portray.  I'll absolutely be back here when I visit my sister again and could see it also as a great place to stay for Spring Training."}
{"text":"By far the most comfortable bed I have slept in in the last couple years. The food and the service was just spectacular.  I booked this room for a work trip not realizing it was a bed and breakfast and it definitely turned my business trip in to a mini vacation."}
{"text":"I would have like to have stayed here - we booked in August for January - but due to a family emergency we had to cancel about 60 days in advance.  Their cancellation policy is clear, and it is rigid.  You will pay for two nights if you cancel - even if they have literally MONTHS to rebook your room.  Because this is essentially all I know of the place first-hand, I was left with the impression that the customer experience at this establishment is so poor that they do not have any confidence they can rebook a room even when they have two months to do so.  Otherwise they'd have a much more customer-friendly policy."}
{"text":"Went there during a festival in downtown Glendale. There were only a handful of tables with patrons between at least two servers, but my gf and I sat at our table and were passed by multiple times without being acknowledged. After waiting nearly fifteen minutes without so much as a drink order, we left and went to a pizza place across the street."}
{"text":"I was thinking that this would be a nice retreat for my wife and myself. I was wrong. I had written to cancel and even though it was more than a month in advance of the reservation they charged full price for the room. I called and left a message a few days later when I noticed the charge on my credit card. There was no answer at the inn and even though I left my name and phone number I never received a call back. I called again and was able to finally get through. The lady on the phone was not nice at all and simply stated that they did not offer any refunds and that basically I was out of luck.  I could not recommend that anyone should even consider staying at this location, just the attitude of the people alone is enough to drive any customers away."}
{"text":"My finace booked a room at the Gaslight this past weekend for my birthday.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised by the great customer service, and the size of the rooms.  The best part of the stay was the next morning though, as the breakfast was outstanding. Breakfast started out with a plate of scones that, while simple, were delicious. We both ordered the Benedict scramble as our main course.  You don't see that very often, but I was happy as I prefer my eggs scrambled rather than poached.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the ham was great, and the English muffin light and fluffy.  I highly recommend a stay here for anyone travelling to the Glendale area, or even locals like me looking for a nice place for a staycation."}
{"text":"Not Family Friendly  The restroom at Gas Light Inn displays framed photographs of people hardly wearing any clothes, posing in sexually suggestive ways.  It is not appropriate for children.  It is not appropriate for anyone who prefers to think clean thoughts.  I understand not everyone is offended by, or even dislikes sexually suggestive photographs.  My review is simply a warning to people who prefer family-friendly environments and to people traveling with children.  I also ask management to consider the type of guests they are trying to attract to their establishment when they change the bathroom wall displays."}
{"text":"A perfect place to stay during spring training.  It's mixes the benefits of a hotel with the feel of a bed and breakfast.  Rooms are nice, parking close by and restaurants and bar right there.  Breakfast is bistro style and cookies/ coffee / scones are available 24/7. This will be our yearly hub during preseason. Theresa treats you like family ( without having to do any chores)  A gem"}
{"text":"Great inn! My friends wedding party filled all 10 rooms, service is awesome, beds are super comfy and real thick bath towels. Their little wine bar is amazing, and their breakfast is homemade goodness."}
{"text":"Why?   Why stay in the middle of a dead town?  Nothing is open around you.   All there is to do is so far away you must drive.    The food you are served at the bread n breakfast is prepackaged, frozen and tastes terrible.     Don't borher"}
{"text":"Booked a room for my fiance and I during Thanksgiving with my family.  The rooms are nice, the staff is friendly and helpful...the food is excellent!! Only problem was being woken in the middle of the night by ghosts!! Both of us woke up to sounds of furniture being drug across the floor and footsteps up and down the hallways.  We were on the first floor and sounds were coming from above.  Was woken once by sounds of a little girl talking and laughing....i did not feel threatened at all...but be aware!"}
{"text":"At Glendale glitters stopped in for hot chocolate at this hidden gem and  such an amazing place the staff is friendly outgoing food excellent and reasonably priced. Took you'd of the rooms really beautiful and fair priced . So if your in downtown Glendale stop on in and see a historic beautiful inn and have a drink and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere and friendly folks and a warm meal you won't regret it"}
{"text":"I love the Gaslight inn!  When I lived in Glendale, I would come here for coffee, tea, lunch, wine, and jazz.  No matter what time of the day, there is a good reason to stop in to this Old Town Glendale gem."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a group of friends recently. The rooms at the inn are charming and worth taking the tour. The food was . . . ok . . . good enough to go again if I'm in the area, but not a place I'll make a special trip to Glendale for. I had the barbecue pork sandwich which was good. My friend had the quesadilla and it looked delicious. I was disappointed when my sandwich came with chips - and it was a bag of potato chips you can get at the store."}
{"text":"Same owners as Old Towne Glendale Wine and Beer Bar.  I will be reserving the entire B&B for the night of our wedding, and I can not wait!  Everyone here is so nice, and the remodel is amazing.  Every room of this 10 Room B&B is fantastically furnished with antiques, and has their own restroom.  The building itself if magnificent.  I really think these guys are going to capture a great audience!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to find the Gaslight inn while I was in town for business. I stayed here for three nights and was impressed. Lets talk first about what really matters..the bed, it was VERY VERY comfortable...lots of fluffy pillows and a big fluffy comforter. The owner and all of the staff were very friendly, every morning they have fresh delicious coffee and breakfast. They serve breakfast starting at 8am and I had to be at work by that time so I can't speak to the quality of the breakfast but I am sure it was great. I had dinner one night downstairs and it was pretty good, I read a review where someone said they wouldn't go out of there way to eat there but if they were in town they would go back and I agree with that statement....not goo enough to drive across town, but if you are in the neighborhood definitely worth stopping by.  Overall, my experience was a good one and I would stay here again....OOOH and they serve chocolate chip cookies at night so how can you not love that!"}
{"text":"We recently stayed at the Gaslight Inn for a High Tea Bridal Shower that my mom and I hosted. The High Tea event that the Inn organized was the perfect bridal shower. The food and beverages were excellent and the woman who organized the tea knew what she was doing. I don't have a single complaint about it. If you are hosting an event like a bridal shower, look into this place. We also stayed at the Inn while in Glendale area, and the rooms were very comfortable, nice looking, and reasonably priced. The owner of the Gaslight Inn, Teresa, is great to work with and very friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a superb little B and B. Your first look may not convince you, but stay and you will get the full experience. The beds, linens, antiques, the towels are all top quality the best part thought is the service from Teresa the owner and manager. She takes care of you so well and cooks you an amazing full breakfast every morning. Don't pass this place up for some chain hotel...this is so much better at the same or better price. I've been here 4 or 5 time and have never been disappointed. Oh there's also a cool wine bar with wine and beer and other great restaurants in walking distance."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in the Gas Light Inn. Myself and a few friends decided to have coffee and breakfast here because we like supporting local businesses.   We were surprised at the low prices of their menu items but after we received our food, we knew why. My self and a friend had the breakfast burrito that seemed to be 90% potato and it was very small. I finished it in about 6 bites. My other friend got eh caprizi. which was 2 small slices of tomato with the cheese on top.   I had never been so I wanted to look around. I asked one of the girls if I could look upstairs and she said of course. As I was coming back down the stairs and another employee said \"um, she told you that you can't go up there, right?\" I said no, she said I could and the girl just rolled her eyes and walked away.   I really want this place to succeed, but with their terrible food and customer service, it is not going to happen. I will give it another try at night with live music, but I am not getting my hopes up at all."}
{"text":"I went to Glendale Glitters last Friday after not having gone in over a decade. Didn't spend much time there but was hungry and wanted some food and a drink. A friend suggested Haus Murphy so we went there. Unfortunately there was a 30-45 minute wait, apparently everyone in Glendale wanted to eat there. Cold and not wanting to go far we back tracked to a place we passed by on the walk. Gaslight Inn. I figured that since its billed as more of a bed and breakfast that fewer people would go there and it didn't have a line out on Glendale.  First we were sat next to the stage which I didn't care for since it would have been hard to have a conversation without losing our voices so we asked that they move us. The hostess did and we sat along the west wall. I say this because initially it took a solid 10 minutes to get anyone to notice us or get us a drink. My friend went over to get the attention of our waitress Danielle. She looked around as if someone else was suppose to come over and it was their area. No worries, she came over immediately and apologized.  I got some water with some wine and my friend got a \"girlie\" drink. I'm not a fan of them but it actually tastes awesome. It was a chocolate drink in a martini glass. She came back to take our order and informed me they were short staffed that night and she'd be the one taking our order. We each got sandwiches and split a board of bruschetta. We picked three (one with figs, one with salami and one with green apples) and Danielle recommended the one with strawberry.   Our food came out very quick and although the sandwich was what I was craving the bruschetta ended up being a hit. Everyone loved their sandwiches but the bruschetta disappeared. I have to say it was the best that I've had and was pleasantly surprised. In addition, my friend got the apple cider martini drink and that was even better that the chocolate one. (I don't remember names of food or drink but refer to stuff by flavor)  Even though Danielle was very apologetic, the food and drink made up for the wait at the beginning. Everything was excellent. I only gave it 4 stars because of the wait and having to attract someone's attention. We borderline would have left and would have missed out.  I forgot to mention there was live music. This guy was a one man band and played a mean sax. I thought he was playing a recording but it was all him. That was definitely a plus. I believe they have rooms on the second floor of the inn and when I asked they said there were 10, so it would be a good place to go if staying downtown although I don't know the room rate."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here recently, on the 2nd day of it's reopening. My wife had the Roasted Chicken & Pesto Panino and I went with the Bruschetta. Both selections were great. The Gas Light Inn is in my neighborhood so I plan on many future visits and recommend that others give it a try. Love this place!"}
{"text":"CLOSED AGAIN!  Drove all the way out there to see Delphine Cortez who was supposed to perform tonight only to find the place dark and shuttered!  At least have the courtesty to pull down your website!"}
{"text":"Very nice B&B located in downtown/old town Glendale. Danielle was very welcoming and friendly. Bed very comfy and the decor and interior charming.  Fresh berries and waffles or omelette for breakfast and freshly ground coffee, yummy. We had the whole place to ourselves being that we were there in a Sunday night. Quiet!"}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Gaslight Inn.  The rooms are amazingly big and very well appointed.  Breakfast was well done and you are right in the heart of downtown with amazing restaurants and fun shopping.  We will stay here again."}
{"text":"We has a lovely tea here. Courses were: fruit, quiche, sandwiches, scones, dessert. Everything was fresh (scones were finishing baking while we were in beginning courses) and service was excellent. I was worried as there was only one other table with us until we were leaving and another table came in but, again, quite, excellent food and service. Well worth the $25. We will be back,"}
{"text":"Tea was wonderful!  Lots of nice antiques,  and the food was fresh and so tasty!  We made reservations for Saturday so we could see the servers dressed in period costumes.  They stressed I  confirm my reservation myself and there were no costumes.  The food saved the day.  We left talking about whose birthday or shower we could hold here next!"}
{"text":"A great little place to hide away and have a delicious snack, great wine and cold beer.  We had the cheese platter with wine and beer.  Some very interesting, unusual aged cheeses with a smooth scoop of hummus presented on a cutting board.  Nice load of bread on the side. We went at an odd time after lunch and before dinner.  Not much else was open and that turned out to be a good thing!"}
{"text":"New owners just bought the place and we were given a private tour last night, prices seem really reasonable and it was hopping for the new grand opening! highly recommend it as place to check out now! and the new rooms look fabulous! We ended our tour at the cute little wine bar! Enjoyed a glass of wine and then we toodled on out to the Glendale Glitters! Good Luck GTO Gaslight Inn!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place to stay! Definitely a fan, the room was so spacious, the website did not do it justice at all.  Was charming with all the antiques & has a quaint, unfinished look.  Breakfast was good."}
{"text":"Our stay at gaslight was fantastic! The accommodations are not only comfortable but you can tell the owners go above and beyond to make your stay fantastic! I mean come on! All the hallways have fresh baked cookies and keurigs to make yourself some fresh coffee. The restaurant and wine bar attached to the inn has fantastic food and a wide selection of wines. I know I won't stay anywhere else next time I need to visit AZ!"}
