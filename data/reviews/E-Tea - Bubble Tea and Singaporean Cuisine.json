{"text":"E- Tea has two sections- the bubble tea takeout counter and in the back they have a little restaurant. My review is based on my bubble tea experience.

E-Tea is somewhat small but has a large counter where they serve different types of bubble teas, iced-coffees, Italian soda's etc. My intention was to buy some bubble tea supplies for home but the guy working there did not have any. Instead, he directed me to Asian markets around the area where I could find some; I thought that was really nice and helpful.

After looking over the gigantic beverage menu, I decided upon a mango bubble tea. The bubble teas here are made out of powder and come in one standard sized cup. I paid around $3.77 for a cup which was about 14oz. The drink was refreshing and the tapioca was cooked perfectly. However, the mango flavor did not taste too much like mango which was disappointing. I also find the price to be much for a drink like that.

Not a big fan of the bubble tea here, but I'm willing to give them another chance just because the guy working here was really kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Offers a wide variety of bubble tea flavours, although I admittedly order some strawberry/banana variant almost every time so I'm not well qualified to speak to how good all their flavours are, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoy their strawberry banana offering and that service was good, prices seemed reasonable and they offer both late hours and a convenient location."}
{"text":"One of the better bubble tea places in Chinatown, but still, it's nothing special.

But, do try the soy bubble tea!"}
{"text":"- ALOT of flavours
- I ordered avocado but it wasn't that good
- I generally prefer liquid mixes but they used powders so it tasted less real to me
- open late. Til 2am. Great for late night cravings.
- space to sit around and hang out
- taste was generally ok..but my boyfriend loved his strawberry banana though."}
{"text":"Came here because I desperately had to use the bathroom ... so I paid $7 (I think) for a subpar fresh fruit mango bubble tea.

It wasn't delicious.  I have had better.  And it was over-priced.

The bathroom was really gross too ... not E-Tea's fault since I think they share the bathroom with the other tenants in the building.  But, it is one of those washrooms you see in movies - narrow hallway, dark, dingy, yucky, and although this washroom didn't have a single hanging light bulb with a string to turn on and off, one would have fit perfectly in this washroom.

Anyway, still on the hunt for a yummy fresh fruit bubble tea :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the variety of flavors they offer. Ended up getting a Honey Aloe Vera hot tea which was delicious and not too sweet. It came from a jar of green \"stuff\" that looked like the consistency of crushed up Aloe Vera. Now that's what I'm talking about. They even threw in some tapioca for free so I could try it. 

I haven't tried the food but I'd recommend stopping by for any kind of drink you could want."}
{"text":"Decent quality and open late. I got the passionfruit bubble tea.
