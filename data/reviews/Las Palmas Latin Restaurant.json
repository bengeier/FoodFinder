{"text":"I'm glad I tried this restaurant out, I was wary since there was no website, no online menu, no reviews or photos. Like most South American restaurants I've been to, it looks like a small family-run restaurant. The deco is simple and the atmosphere is very cozy. The table set-up seats no guests no more than 4 to a table, when our party of 5 came in, there was no service staff out front so we had to move tables around ourselves and seat ourselves.

Like most small Spanish restaurants, the staff didn't speak much English, so it's hard to ask questions about the menu. However, despite the language barrier the waitress was very helpful, friendly and tried her best to answer our questions.

I ordered the Paiza (beef steak, chorizo, chicharron, beans, fried plantains and a fried egg), while my brothers ordered the chicken breast and the chipotle chicken, and my parents one of the soups. The food came out fairly quickly (we passed time trying to understand the Spanish soap opera on the tv). The beef was super flavourful, it was my favourite thing on my plate. The chicharron was nice and crispy. The chorizo was good too. The rice wasn't seasoned or flavourful enough compared to what I'm used to. I got to try my brother's chipotle chicken, he liked it but I thought it tasted weird and nothing like chipotle. Along with our food, they gave us small plates of Salvadoran corn tortillas (I think called papusas?) And a bowl of bean puree. The tortillas were delicious, we could tell they were made in-house like everything else. The bean puree was ok, I'm more a fan of whole beans and honestly, a small bowl to share between 4 people (I had my own) was not enough. Also, if you're a fan of spiciness, definitely ask/try their hot sauce, it's a good heat level and looked/tasted homemade too. Overall, I love the homey feel and taste of everything, it feels like I went to eat at someone's house as opposed to a restaurant. The price is also pretty good, we spent around $80 when we're used to spending over $100 when we eat out. I definitely will be going back to try their other stuff and get more of their tortillas and hot sauce."}
