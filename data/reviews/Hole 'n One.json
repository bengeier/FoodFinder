{"text":"Greeted by Marty, service was fast and efficient, food was hot and exactly what I ordered. There was plenty on the plate to share with my son and left overs! Great joyous conversations taking place around us. Good family environment."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast. We knew it has been a local favorite for years and wanted to give it a try.  The food and service was adequate but nothing special. We prefer other local spots to this one and probably won't rush back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have a great gluten free menu that allows my kids to have a breakfast out."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Ribs were smoky and tangy. The pork sandwich was moist and tasty. Baked potato was cooked perfectly. Nice potato salad and baked beans.  Great prices. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"food is usually ok but the service is awful-they fool around too much-owner not friendly-last time I went there waited 40 minutes still no food-I walked out"}
{"text":"We found this place online and decided to try it out... what a cute restaurant. The people were all nice, and the food was extremely good. We are from Cali, but plan on coming back to Az. at the end of Sept. And plan on coming back to the place. ."}
{"text":"To day I walked into the holes in one.   I was so surprised, a new menu has been added.  They had food for their clients, over 70 customer.  

I had the BBQ Brisket.   It was very good.  I could not try the BBQ sauce do do dietary problems.  

The population of Sun City West is aging and being replaced by younger 55 and up.  The old menu is still there, but the small addition is welcome.  I am sure that it will help to insure their continued popularly with both the aging and new residents.

Marty, the owner, is always there to welcome you.  The staff has, over the past 20+ years has always been consistently the best.  Anyone that dose not meet Marty's standards will not be there long.  The food portions have been and still are the right size.   Coffee, well, some like it hot, some like it were the strong, some like it weak, I like their coffee, not to strong not to weak.  The-Hole-in-one has never served bad food.

What is my experience:  I have lived on the road do to my job as an over the road truck driver for about 10 years.  I have a superior pallet, tested by blind folded taste test identifying foods, 9 out of 10 correct.  I could not identify octopuses, I said squid.   When it comes to food, people have likes and dislikes.  Example:  BBQ, there are different schools on what is BBQ.  One Restaurant proudly advertised they marinated their meats 24 hrs, then slow smoked and other 24 hours.  To me, it is the Texas Style BBQ a dry rub, slow smoked, meats with an optional sauce on the side.  Smoking is as long as it takes, when it's done it's done.  With wood you have to understand the variance and how to control it for perfect BBQ every time.  You can not set a timer and it's done.  Oh, I can cook too.


UPDATE: just had the ribs.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been visiting in Sun City West for close to 20 years and went to Hole n One for the first time today. Looking for a breakfast place and found this on Yelp. Very good service, food was also very good, loved the corned beef hash, eggs were cooked to perfection. Only negative... Called restaurant and Marty answered phone. Because of construction/remodeling in mall couldn't find restaurant. I queried if they were open and he replied 'why wouldn't we'. I explained I'd never been there and couldn't find restaurant, he gave directions."}
{"text":"The new item on the menu is BBQ.  Marty has nailed it. Smokey, meaty and great prices. Definitely worth a visit or two."}
{"text":"Had brunch here while visiting the parents in the area.  Chose it based on Yelp, Google, and TripAdvisor reviews.  Great brunch menu, reasonably priced.  The service was attentive and friendly, and the food was great.  I had the Ham Steak and Eggs.  Ham was very tasty and not salty, well-cooked.  Over easy eggs were perfect.  One pancake was a little overdone but still tasty.  Guest had the Strawberry Belgian Waffle and raved about it.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast burrito home fries seemed packaged or frozen ample parking nice staff"}
{"text":"Mom takes me here all the time. It's the best down home comfort type food place in sun city west. That said, it happens that it's a pretty good place to begin with. The staff are always friendly and the service is always prompt. The food is hot and fresh and the portions are generous given the prices. 

In addition to the traditional cafe type breakfasts lunches and dinner they also have their own smoker. And they know how to use it. Delicious melt in Your mouth brisket and pulled pork that is mouthwatering and a variety of sides included with the bbq dinners. The bbq sauce is on the sweet side but if you add a little tabasco, it heats up nicely.

Oh. So you know, this place can get pretty busy at times. So. Be prepared. 

I guess you could say I'm a new \"regular\".  Thanks Marty!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was quick and super friendly. This will become one of our go-to breakfast spots."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant a few times and have enjoyed each visit. This restaurant is located near a few different \"senior living communities\" and is well worth the visit, if are in the area and need a great breakfast! The majority of the people that frequent this restaurant are senior citizens; so you might have to walk a little slower, and be more patient and gentle while you are in the area.

The inside has a golf theme with lots of booths, big comfortable chairs and round tables. This would be a great place to meet a group of people for a brunch. The food is delicious, very well priced and they give you a good sized portion.

This is a down-home local restaurant, not very glitzy, but it has charm and the servers are nice.

I would recommend this place to family and friends; it was recommended to us by Gordon Putz, a fine gentlemen of a by-gone age. Rest in peace Gordy!"}
{"text":"A local hangout in SCW.  Justly famous for their good food and friendly service.  Today I had the grilled ham and cheese sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The sandwich had so much thinly sliced ham (real ham, not lunch meat) that I had to look inside to make sure it had cheese as well! It did and was delicious.  The sweet potato fries are house made and the best ever.  They bear no relation to those krinkle cut sweet potato fries one sees most places.  Service is always friendly and prompt.  Little extras include things like their own homemade blackberry jam.  We drop by for lunch at least once on every trip to SCW."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. Sometimes the breakfast is very good. Sometimes it is not good. Corned Beef Hash is good. Last visit I had Eggs Benedict. It was tasteless and I got a small portion of Hash Browns. The coffee is absolutely the worst I have ever had. It tastes like there is still dish soap in the pot."}
{"text":"Good breakfast joint.  In Sun City"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a busy Saturday morning, about 9 am. Food was delivered fast and hot. Omelette was big as the plate. Homemade jam for toast and the cinnamon role was divine!!!! Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Solid All-American coffee shop. Consistent, friendly breakfast spot. Very popular, especially after church services on Sunday! Booths and tables. Clean room of rest too! Good for groups, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast. Super friendly service, and senior-friendly (of course). Food is tasty, nothing remarkable., but delivers quickly."}
{"text":"Wanna go back in time to the 60's?  Good burgers and fries and a great place for breakfast.  Good service and you'll be surprised when you get your check - almost 1960 prices!  Not really, but cheap eats."}
{"text":"This is what a traditional American coffee shop style restaurant is supposed to be.  There's a golf course theme in the simple, clean dinningroom. The food is old fashioned-Mom's-cookin' yummy.  The breakfast menu is served all day. The portions are nice sized.  There are daily \"specials\" offered at both breakfast and on the after twelve o'clock menu.  I think what makes this place stand out, though, is the wait- staff.  The wait staff are efficient, friendly, helpful - the boss must treat them right, because there has been very little change in the staff.  While efficiently serving, they also take the time to become familiar with the \"regulars.\"  The main clientele base is made up of the over 60 crowd since it's located in SCW.  This isn't a dinner-by-candlelight, fancy restaurant - it's good food at a good price served by friends.  Personally - that's what I like."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Hole in One on Saturday... it was delicious!! Steak and eggs... yummy"}
{"text":"Love this place. Marty the owner is always there to greet you. The waitstaff is excellent and their breakfast cook is top notch.
The communal table is great to listen to- retired guys talking politics, gossip, whatever.
Breakfast are awesome, crispy hashbrowns and amazing biscuits and gravy. One of favorite breakfast places anywhere."}
{"text":"Large serving of soup as a side is a plus. Good turkey burger. Convenient cafe close by - handy for a quick lunch. Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today and had the All-U-Can eat fried fish.  Wow, what a major disappointment.  While the fish was lightly breaded it was dry and bland. Even the tartar sauce provided was watery and lacked any flavor.  Our server was nice and made multiple visits to refill drinks and see if we wanted more fish (no thanks).  We'll give them another try for breakfast, but not for the fish."}
{"text":"Cute place, large portions and like home cooking. Kind of like an old fashioned restaurant. Would return."}
{"text":"We had lunch here with the In-laws today. Highlights: the wait staff is awesome. Fast, friendly, fun; everyone here is ON it.
Lowlights: the food. It's not terrible, but kind of meets expectations of a diner in a strip mall. Weak coffee, white bread, smaller portions, nothing was particularly great. Nothing really sucked; but was just mediocre. They must be doing something right, it was crowded and my in-laws like it. I'd rather go without eating than visit here again."}
{"text":"Typical coffee shop fair except when it comes to the BBQ ribs.  Well smoke with a nice bark and really tasty sauce.  If yo live in Sun City West why travel for good BBQ Ribs. Stay close and enjoy some nice tasting fair"}
{"text":"One of the main hangouts in SCW for the locals.  Not one of my personal favorites food wise.  Everything tasted bland.  In fact, I've had a lot better breakfasts at a few of the local golf courses.  The staff however is wonderful.  Everyone was really friendly, and quick, I didn't have to ask to have my water refilled once.  Too bad about the food though, or this could be a very good local spot."}
{"text":"We come here every time we're in town visiting the in-laws. Its not fancy but the breakfasts are always tasty, delivered as ordered, and the homemade jam is yummy. we've never had anything but friendly service and servers who come back many times to make sure all is well and your coffee cup is full."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best breakfast in Sun City West. Hone 'n One is a definite throwback to a time when local eateries were more common and when you walked in the door, you knew what to expect. Good down to earth basics with people who work and run the establishment as if they were happy to see you. Marty is always around checking on things and if you are looking for a no-nonsense good meal, this must be the place!"}
{"text":"We have gone to HoleinOne several times, but have not been overwhelmed by the cleanliness. Tonight I was in the mood for French Onion soup and consulted Yelp for great and best onion soup
 Lo, behold Hole in One garnered four red stars for Onion soup, so we decided to try again.
Our waitressses were prompt, but not only did they not have French Onion soup, they couldn't remember when they served it.
We settled for split pea soup (good) a half salad for her, and liver and onions with corn for me. Liver tough, corn a 1/3 cob of soppy kerrnals. The half salad was.priced one buck less than a full.salad; something we weren't warned about.
On merit, our experience will keep us away from this outfit."}
{"text":"Diner fare served with great customer service.    Our group all had standard breakfasts and all were good.    Customer service excellent.   Maybe only critique would be coffee upgrade?   Would go again!"}
{"text":"The best! Fluffy eggs, perfect bacon. People are friendly.  Came here for breakfast on gameday.  GO SEAHAWKS!"}
{"text":"Typical cafe fare, service has always been good, the food is good though I'm pretty sure they use some premade soups and salad dressings. We go about niece every two weeks, have had both breakfast and dinner. 
It is a quick, dependable little restaurant, gets busy for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very very busy. I had the blueberry pancakes with eggs and ham. My five year old not only ate all of his food he kept stealing pieces of my pancakes. He told me they were the greatest pancakes he ever had lol. Great blueberry syrup with blueberries on top."}
{"text":"Found this cafe in a strip mall as we were driving around looking for a place to have breakfast.  We decided to take a chance and walked into a surprisingly packed packed restaurant for a Tuesday morning.  We had coffee on the table within minutes and a smiling friendly server handing us menus.  Delicious food, great portions, crispy hash browns...excellent.  A must for breakfast. They serve lunch, but we are hooked on breakfast."}
{"text":"I've only been to Hole 'n One for breakfast, but I've been many, many times.  It's just about my favorite breakfast place in the Surprise, SCW area.   The wait staff is OUTSTANDING!!  Friendly and efficient at the same time.  The omelets are great, and the hash browns are the best.  The blackberry jam is so good you want to just eat it with a spoon.  Since I'm not a really early person, I love the fact that they serve breakfast late.  I'd send anyone to Hole 'n One for breakfast.  One of these days I'm going to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Good prices, friendly staff.

The Denver omelet wasn't an omelet but a scrambled conglomeration. Wasn't very tasty, and needed salt.

Liver & Onions - tasty tender liver, but cole slaw and beans were too sweet.

Had to wait to pay bill as the cashier was also busy seating people. It would be nice to have a hostess separate from the cashier during the busy noon hour.

Probably will not return"}
{"text":"I eat here several times week.  The food is always good, and the great service keeps me coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the service and food quality and quantity. Very busy at times so be prepared to wait. Not fancy, but it doesn't matter. Logically priced."}
{"text":"Dated restaurant with okay food. Service good by some down right awful by others. Checked out food going to other tables looked good. The toast used for my club sandwich while lacking color was over cooked. The use of two small toothpicks to hold the sandwich together pissed me off as after removing the one I saw I grabbed sandwich and when taking a bite got nailed in the nose with the pick sticking out the other side. 1 long pick would be sufficient and much safer especially to the unknowing traveler who stated, \"I've never been here before\""}
{"text":"The lunch/dinner food here is average on good days, but I think their breakfast is really good.  Their pancakes are fluffy and buttery :)   And if I remember correctly, you can order breakfast anytime of day.  The wait staff is usually pretty good, but I can remember a couple of times my grandfather didn't think they were very good (he is notoriously impatient though).  This is one of my favorite restaurants near Sun City."}
{"text":"I ordered oatmeal and fruit. The fruit was canned, the oatmeal was watery with no taste. Yuck.."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst first impression I've ever had for a breakfast. I ordered bacon, eggs, toast, which wasn't even toasted, and hash browns. Everything came as cold as cold could be, for what was supposed to be hot. If I was the cook and or waitress, I would be ashamed."}
