{"text":"I write this review out of sadness, not anger.  When I was a lad growing up in Madison, Pizza Pit was THE delivery pizza.  Birthdays, sleepovers, all-night board-game sessions, we always ordered  Pit.  They had the best TV ads too, classics like the VW bug in the snow, and \"pizza my heart\" and the riff on Deck the Halls, including the line, \"the corrugated box prevents heat-lossage\".  Funny stuff I remember to this day.  In college I ate at their campus location every other day, a slice and a drink, and loved it.  I left town in the early 90s, and later heard the company had major problems and basically fell apart.  I returned early 00's to find they only had a few locations, and everyone I asked said DO NOT EAT THERE.  Made me sad to think how far they had fallen.  I finally worked up the courage to try them again a few weeks ago.  Since they don't sell slices anymore, I ordered a sandwich.  Nothing complicated - just a turkey-cheese melt.  Well, the store was filthy for a start, not a good sign.  The kitchen was moderately busy with phone calls and walk-ins, but nothing crazy.  But it took them nearly 40 minutes to make my sandwich while I waited.    During that time, I had a front row seat to why they were so busy: it seems like 2/3 of their transactions were either dealing with someone complaining about an order taking too long to arrive, or being totally screwed up and having to be corrected, or back-kitchen bitching about who was gonna deal with some customer they didn't want to talk to.  Yes, all in full voice so I could not avoid hearing the gory details.  At one point, one of the workers came out with a big black garbage bag full of god-knows-what, plopped it on the booth next to mine, and left it there for the rest of my dinner.  When my sandwich finally came out, it was basically a small handful of rubbery-looking deli turkey slices and a couple of slices of swiss half-melted onto the deadest, mushiest \"italian\" roll you have ever seen.  Came with a drink and a bag of chips - OH, and a couple of packs of mayonnaise to tear-n-squeeze onto the sandwich, you know, like in a shitty cafeteria.  All for nearly $10.  What a waste of time.  I can't say I've tried their pizza, but according to a FB message board about old-time Madison, people are saying they tried to copy Domino's sauce in the 90s because they thought people preferred bland, flavorless pizzas.  I remember their sauce being a little spicy and pretty good.  \"Devilishly Hot\" was the slogan.  If that's the case, I think I will save myself the effort and skip them altogether.  Too bad; I have good memories of their old pizza and would love to taste it again.  As for the modern incarnation of Pizza Pit - it's the very epitome of the worst kind of shitty restaurant, obviously run by managers who don't give a good goddamn about the facility, the food, their reputation, or really anything other than dodging customers and picking up their paychecks, and staffed by employees who are the kind of stoner/loser/jail-bird types seen in depressing indie-movies about waste-oids trapped in small towns.    GOD what a depressing experience."}
{"text":"For a Chicago pizza fix, Pizza Pit is an OK cure. Decent crust, plenty of toppings, and a very sweet sauce to balance the saltiness of the pepperoni, sausage, and cheese. The prices are very reasonable for deep-dish pizza, and the delivery fee is just $1.   I opted for the sausage and pepperoni small deep dish-- it ran me $13, which I thought was pretty reasonable. Lots of sausage and pepperoni, as well as sauce (I requested extra), though I felt that the amount of cheese was somewhat lacking for a deep dish pie. Not the best I've had, but it'll do in Madison when I want to meet a craving for Chicago-style deep dish."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from here the pizza arrived in a heap on one side of the pizza box. They gave us store credit after we complained (the pizza tasted okay). I have now been waiting for over an hour for my next order. They also struggled to find my credit in their system when I placed my order. Based on the service I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Really nice gyro.  Soft, fresh pita bread, warmed and nicely browned.  Spicy and plentiful meat.  Tangy yogurt sauce and quick service.  Great, quick and inexpensive late night snack.  So good I'd return for lunch.    At a place clearly in business for its' pizza prowess, don't overlook the fantastic gyro."}
{"text":"Pizza extreme is decent for pizza and best for deep dish which is best eaten late night after a few beers or as an alternative to pizza hut.  Sits between the cheap/fast pizza places and the gourmet/authentic type.    Overall it's not bad pizza but nothing really special either.  Heavily saucy deep dish is the best they have."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good.  It is one of my favorite places to order from because they usually have a $15 pizza/wings combo."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat in, great staff and don't even get me started with the food."}
{"text":"This particular pizza pit is highly unlikable.   Not very clean inside and slow. Everytime I have tried eating here, I get sick.   But never at other pizza pits.    Last time I got a delivery, the driver smelled like BEER!   It's safe to say I will not eat here anymore."}
{"text":"This is our usual go-to for delivery.  Employees have always been good to us, even adding coupons we didn't know existed when we call in our order.  Delivery is always fast, and the pizza is good.  Both their hand-tossed and Chicago-style pizza get high marks, and they're great reheated."}
{"text":"Probably the best place for sandwiches in that area. Milios (right next door) ain't got nothing on the amazing deal you can get at Pizza Extreme. A sub, chip, and soda for 5.26 (includes tax). I LOVE this place. They make great subs for SUPER cheap. And they are always really nice. I've never experienced the bad customer service the other reviewer recieved and I've probably been there about 20 times. Definitely an office favorite."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT OR ORDER food from pizza extreme!!!!  i placed an order through room service...my order taker I later found out her name was brittney refused to tell me her name. when I asked her to repeat my order back to me to ensure it was correct she would not say anything. . I asked for extra bacon she said\" hopefully you get it\" ..i asked for th name of the restauraunt and she wouldnt tell me that either. when my order was delivered incorrect. ..I got no bacon. ..asked for fried chicken got grilled. ..I called back and askd for the mgr...he said \" who is this and why are u calling me\" then I called back and exsplained ( very nicely) that I called in a order for a fried chicken sandwich and got grilled and he said.....\" so what!!!!! deal with it\" this is the mgr...\"tj is his name.....then he hung up again.....i had customer service call and he yelled expletives at her( b**ch) and asked her why she was calling. never before have I been yelled at and hung up on my a mgr when trying to get my order correct. do not give them your business."}
{"text":"OK, I have been a fan of Pizza Pit since one of my first trips to Madison soon after getting my driver's license. Back then Pizza Pit was a mini-chain around Madison. Most are now owned by individuals. Oregon's Pizza Pit is one of those individually owned and luckily use the Pizza Pit formula. I just like their crust and sauce. The crust is thin, but not too thin and the sauce has that rich taste that I like for Pizza. A good mix of ingredients on the pizza. Their service is good."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Sorry.  Greasy and flavorless.  We fought over who had to take the leftovers... I'm sure they got thrown out.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. To me, sauce makes the pizza.  The crust is the canvas, and very important, no doubt, but the sauce is the base layer of paint, the flavor platform that all else is built upon.  PPE has a great sauce. No \"Daddy Joe's\" red simple syrup here; herbaceous, zesty, bright tomato flavors. Toppings are of good quality and generously portioned. Oh, and the crust?  It's pretty tasty, as well. Go with the thin crust; it's not as thin as you'd think, and is a good balance of crisp and chew. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a pizza to order....."}
{"text":"I was over charged for pizza by $7 and management was terribly rude and refused to correct the mistake. The sad thing was that this was my first time trying this place and the pizza wasn't even good. Too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I particularly like Pizza Extreme's pesto pizza. They use a LOT of pesto and it's wonderful.   When I get a pesto stuffed pizza I actually prefer to take it home and put it in the refrigerator for a while until it cools off and sets up. Then it's easier to cut and easier to eat.   A couple of pieces of cold stuffed pesto pizza and a big glass of milk. Or the pepper flavored V-8 juice. Or a beer. Or a Bloody Mary. Just outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Being the best pizza in Oregon is about the same prestige as being the best hockey player in Uganda, you don't get alot of bragging rights. The pizza and other menu items are decent , service good and the delivery is fast."}
{"text":"I originally had a negative review based on the collective experience we'd had for many orders; the one prior to this, I removed after doing all the legwork to get a hold of the actual owner, despite his \"manager's\" outrageous behavior (I won't detail it again - suffice it to say it involved personal insults and a host of other crap, along with refusing to give me any way to get in touch with the owner).  Only after seeing my review did the owner contact me.  He assured me we'd have no more hiccups, and in good faith, we believed him.  Ordered a couple nights ago, through grubhub.  Would think it wasn't a toughie, a medium one-topping pizza, and an extra-large two topping pizza.  Well - yep, it was, as usual, an apparent toughie.  After over an hour, two....medium pizzas arrived, though we'd paid for one medium and one extra large.  This happens all the time with these people, and I regret we gave them another shot.  The original reasoning given was that the two medium pizza order was what they got from Grubhub, and so they can't help the error.  As it turns out, em, yep, it was at the store end - on consulting THEIR OWN TICKET it said the right order.  Screwed up order.  Again.  And again.  And....well, yeah.  I want to be clear, the driver wasn't at fault and he was a great guy.  It was at the store level.  Simply, they don't have their ^%$# together.  At all.  Additionally, and this is a warning on Grubhub - but though grubhub says they accept Paypal, they do NOT accept PP credit, and this policy isn't mentioned anywhere on the site.  Though this is our default payment method, today we were surprised to find out it's coming from our checking account.  This wasn't planned for, and it is going to screw us up with fees.  Thanks so much."}
{"text":"This is probably an odd review, since it's not this location's food we've had (have had it and enjoyed it from another store, like 5 years now), but I wanted to just mention that we had a bump with our location, and the Odana Rd folks got involved and did everything they could to try and straighten it out.  From the driver, to the woman who took my call, to a gent earlier on who took the original order, and as of today, from one of the owners of the company itself, all very helpful, and all very much appreciated.  We enjoy Pizza Pit quite a bit and have been longtime customers; just feel it's important to lend praise where it's due, and it's due here.  Thanks very much, guys."}
{"text":"Possibly the best pizza in town, and they deliver.  Lots of other stuff on the menu too.  Pizza is plentiful in college towns (Gumby's, Papa John's, etc.), but good pizza is a rarity."}
{"text":"I know it is the weekend, however, waiting 2 hours for a pizza delivery without a return call is crazy, plus when you try to call they do not even answer!! Never again will we order from them."}
{"text":"Ordered my usual large anti pasta salad that i normally order from odana rd location...salad was smaller...less lettuce...and they charged .50 per extra topping for a salad that costs $7.35 ...i prefer odana rd....more value for your money"}
{"text":"Always fresh....salads are amazing and great value for your money...customer service is always friendly especially CJ...def try the home made house dressing...its like authentic Italian dressing"}
{"text":"Pizza Extreme has the best Hawaiian pizza I have ever had.  Their sauce is wonderfully flavorful and is the key to making their pizzas great.  Their deep dish pizzas are also very tasty."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I ordered delivery from a different Pizza Pit further west, a mega pepperoni, and it was perhaps the best delivery pizza I've ever had -- hot, fresh, doughy, crispy. With this in mind, I recently placed a large order for a party from this Pizza Pit on Monroe, which was the closest one to our venue. Sadly, the pizzas came lukewarm and left much to be desired.   This may have been because the delivery person couldn't figure out how to walk into the building and so there was about a 10-15 minute delay from the time he first called our phone to the time we received our pizzas. However, the taco pizza looked nothing like the menu picture, bright with toppings. Instead, it was pieces of chicken, cheese, and slightly soggy tortilla chips. The buffalo chicken pizza was also unimpressive, more cheese and chicken, and the macaroni pizza was slightly dry, leaving me longing for Ian's instead. I couldn't bring myself to try the fourth pizza. If I find myself having to order from here again, I guess I'd stick with the basics like pepperoni, and pick it up myself if possible.   While ordering, customer service on the phone was great, and they were willing to deliver slightly outside of their zone for such a large order. Ragret. I should have taken that as a hint to go elsewhere. Unfortunately, the helpful and polite phone service just can't cover the price of a subpar food experience for our large group."}
{"text":"The folks behind the counter were pleasant, and the \"greek salad\" to go was arranged nicely. I say \"greek salad\" because it was basically a normal salad with olives, feta, and banana peppers. I see what you did there with those pizza toppings.   I've had better frozen pizza, though we did grab whatever slices had been sitting under the heat lamp. Their soda machine was either out of syrup or not working that day, and we had to inform them about it since they weren't aware. They offered us a can instead, which was technically a downgrade from a ~16oz cup to 12 oz.   I think this is more of a to-go place, since their phones were inexplicably ringing off the hook."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, but they are rarely open. I've called several times around 8:30 ish and they have said that they were closing soon and they were not making anymore food. They are supposed to be open until 10, which is sad because I love the pizza here."}
{"text":"OK, where did I start? I logged onto their web site where they have a menu and pricing. The family and I made our choices and I placed the call. Ironically the$34 worth of food I choose wound up coming to $52? When questioned I was told the pricing on the web site was wrong. Nice, the $18 over charge wasn't worth fighting the family on new restaurant. I keep getting conflicting pricing when on the phone, so when the food came I asked for an itemized receipt which the delivery guy didn't have. Now lets get to the food.We ordered 20 wings which were flavor less and rubbery. We ordered a taco pizza which was like a cheap frozen pizza with stale nachos on top? Greek salads were with little toppings, but the lettuce was fresh. The meal was finished off with baklava and the not so free Ice cream the website promised. To sum this up this was honestly the worst food I've ever had from a pizza place, and I was clearly overcharged by any standards. Stay away, and don't be bamboozled like I was."}
{"text":"Every Tuesday when I go to play D&D, I'll stop in to get a slice or two and I've always enjoyed it. I especially recommend getting the Chicago stuffed pizza which I can't get enough of. When I'm next door playing at Pegasus Games, there are always deliveries from Pizza Pit from the very friendly staff who don't charge extra for the delivery itself. Our gaming society and Pizza Pit share a very cohesive relationship, pizza is something that to me seems almost essential for when I'm doing a campaign and it's great for groups when they have a big party. It seems like being next door to each other makes Pizza Pit's business quite profitable and an ideal location. Thank you guys, keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"The macaroni and cheese pizza is out of this world. I ate half the pizza by myself. The crust was good, not too thin or thick and still a little chewy. Exactly how I like it. Would revisit in a heart beat, especially since it's near my house.   The place was clean, and completely empty when we went, which did make us nervous. But the food proved there was no reason to be."}
{"text":"I hate when places close early. Went at 9 when web site said they were open until 10. Wish I could give it proper review but they never gave me the chance."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas from here for delivery, and wasn't expecting much seeing as it was very cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got one thick crust and one thin. The thin was pretty floppy and greasy, but still very flavorful. The thick crust was much better and nice and crunchy, and I got it with the pesto sauce which was terrific and definitely recommended. Delivery time was about 45 minutes which wasn't too bad. Overall it exceeded my expectations, I'll definitely be ordering this in the future over the big pizza chains."}
{"text":"Some of the best deep dish pizzas in town. I work nearby so I've had every (no joke) pizza on the menu and they are all great. The KC Barbecue, Bucky and Olympic Garden are some of my favorites."}
{"text":"This place deserves some love. Their vegetarian taco pizza is the best meatless pizza in Madison in my opinion. The flavor profiles of everything put together is amazing and I'm impressed everytime. Factor in fair prices for appetizers and the pizza itself and low delivery fees and you have a real winner here."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 foid itens. Mozzarella cheese sticks, Garlic Bread, Potato Wedges and Veg Pizza.   All were above average, nothing extraordinary. That is fine with us. Food was good."}
{"text":"Ok So I ordered a Pizza and WIngs this evening and was a bit frustrated. First the delivery time took 75 mins when I was quoted 45 to 60....not a super big deal but still frustrating. Then I look at my bill and really got ticked off....I had a coupon for 11.99 for my pizza and was charged 12.50 plus an additional 3.75 for toppings - can you say rip off? Then I was charged 1.50 for a delivery fee....the box says FREE DELIVERY. To top it all off after I called....whoever I talked to....simply said the delivery fee goes to the driver and they are supposed to inform people of that....well I didn't get informed. He then said he was sorry and sat there in silence until I simply hung up. I will not order from this location again and I will be attempting to get in contact with a corporate office."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. We had the deep dish and the cheese was very creamy. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This location also has Pizza Pit pizza and ice cream.  They seem to make Pizza Pit pizza if it's a thin-crust order or Pizza Extreme if it's a stuffed-pizza order.  Pizza Pit were a big deal in Madison pizza around 15 years ago.  Then it almost completely disappeared around 1999-2000... when Pizza Extreme and Papa John's came to town.  Pizza Pit has a tasty sauce and distinctive crust.  The toppings and cheese are pretty decent quality.  Pizza Extreme's stuffed pizza is pretty good too.  And it's nice to get them by the slice.  I haven't tried the ice cream or the sandwiches, but it's nice to have that... it sort of rounds out that shopping center.  Chinese food, pizza, sandwiches, and ice cream."}
{"text":"I haven't had the pizza, but this place has good Gyros.  Tip: Ask for lettuce and put it in the gyro. It makes all gyros taste better with a little lettuce."}
{"text":"I've always been happy with Pizza Pit Delivery, so why not pop in and eat there?  Well, don't do it if you're in a hurry.  I was going to a 7pm movie at Market Square, already had tickets and thought I'd grab a sandwich at Pizza Pit.  It's about 100 yards from the movie theater.   6:25pm Entered the place and ordering food wasn't a terrible experience, except that the person who took my order had a very difficult time understanding that they actually served sandwiches (it was right on the menu board behind me).  Finally the order for a sandwich and soda got placed.  My order slip was taken into the kitchen area and the person taking my order decided not to return.  It took about 5 minutes before I could flag someone down to get a cup for the fountain soda I ordered.    6:35pm Cup in hand, off to the soda fountain - pretty standard fare.  Except no ice.  To be sure, I held down the lever for about a minute and listened to the grinding noise.    A few minutes to get someone's attention who worked there.    6:40pm Reported the broken ice dispenser.  Employee acknowledged that it had been broken for awhile.  Apparently nobody bothers to hang a sign, or tell the customers.  A nice woman walks in and waits to order food.  And waits.  And waits.  Nobody is at the front of the store.  She asks me if anyone is working.  I yell into the kitchen to let them know someone was waiting.    6:45pm Finally get someone's attention.  Woman cautiously gives them her order.  I ask about the status of mine.  Employee turns towards the kitchen, scratches his head and then after about a minute of utter confusion, looks back at me, shrugs and walks away.  6:50pm Getting quite nervous (and more and more hungry).  I yell back into the kitchen.  Someone finally come to the counter and I explain that my movie starts in 10 minutes and that I'd like to cancel my order.  I'm asked my phone number.  I explain that I didn't call.  I walked up, ordered and nobody asked me for my number.  I explain my order.  The employee looks confused.  Calls into kitchen for help.  6:55pm After several minutes of searching through order slips, mine is found in the garbage... Really?  My order is cancelled (but I'm not charged for the room-temperature soda I drank).  I dash back to the movie theater, grab a popcorn and soda there (They have ice) and only miss about a minute of the movie.  Pizza Pit - delivery okay.  dine-in: fail."}
{"text":"I was looking for something quick for lunch as its my day off and I had errands to run. I was in the Odana Road area and seen this gem. I thought they HAVE to have lunch specials. Today (Wednesday) they had spaghetti and meatballs which I didn't have as I wasn't digging pasta. Instead I had to slices of pizza.  The special was a soda and 2 slices of pizza for $5.99. I thought that's pretty fair. I had one piece of cheese and once piece of sausage/bacon. It was good although I could tell it had been out for a little bit. I didn't expect the quality to be of Ian's Pizza.   I would definitely go back to try one of there sandwiches. It appears they have lunch specials Monday-Friday for $5.99."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here for a lot of people (4 pies). The service was good (fast and the pizzas were really hot when they got to us), and the price was low. The pizzas were not that great though. I'd order from here again for a big group, but if I'm just getting one pie, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love the deep dish pizza and for lunch you get two big slices with a drink for 5 bucks. Awesome. Sandwiches are good too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"\"it's not terrible, i've had worse\" - my girlfriend  \"for the first time in history, bacon actually made my pizza worse\" - me  At least it was a fun experience ordering & waiting for my pizza to be ready, 15 minutes after it was suppose to be... ha ha"}
{"text":"After a long night of work I decided to give a place I dont and never liked a chance after not having their pizza for a long time.  It was 12:30am and what arrived was a luke warm pizza.  Called the next night and was told by Marty the \"Manager\" sorry but you should of called last night.  Gee, thanks.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"A lazy Sunday precluded me from making dinner so Pizza Pit Extreme was the next best option.  The take-out spot (there are a few tables if you wanted to eat onsite) is a strange one.  It is an amalgamation of three former separate restaurants-Pizza Pit, Pizza Extreme and Athen's gryo.  This makes it a bit challenging ordering online as there are options for that refer to either Pizza Pit or Pizza Extreme but no explanation on what makes them different (case in point, what is Pizza Pit sauce vs Extreme sauce?). The menu is pretty extensive (always a concern for me) so I stuck to a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  With a coupon, the price was right for what we got.  The toppings were pretty standard and not much different that ones found on a store bought pizza.  It was definitely greasy. In a pinch or on a hungover day, I would come back due to how close by it is for me.  I wouldn't, however, hold it as a gold or even silver standard for what a pizza should be."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Burnt doughy disaster greasy and not even close to what we ordered and more than half straight to the garbage.  Never will I order food from Pizza Pit again. I would give negative stars to this ripoff if I could."}
{"text":"OK food. Kind but inept staff. We had errors in how they ring us up then two more errors in what they brought out. Sandwiches bread is great. Gyro meat pretty dry... Like they don't sell enough so it just sits there getting overcooked. The napkin dispensers in the dining room were nearly all empty. The pizza by the slice in the warmer just looked sadly old."}
{"text":"I absolutely love pizza put extreme. Their pizza is incredible and fairly priced, the cheesy garlic bread is TO DIE FOR, and the employees are all incredibly friendly! Be sure to pick up some ice cream when you stop in too! (:"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! yummy food and happy people! The mac and cheese pizza is really good and meatballs as a topping is great!"}
{"text":"Could be a 5 star if the service wasn't so surly and 5minutes from needing to hit the BONG. I mean these dudes don't greet, offer anything, or do anything extra. But they make the heck out of some Chicago style pizza. It's better here than some Chicago style pizzas in Chicago, IL. Go figure."}
{"text":"My fiance and I order from Pizza Extreme fairly frequently. They always deliver in a timely fashion, the cheese is amazing, and they have RC Cola!   One time, after a night of drinking, my fiance called and ordered \"two of the biggest pizzas they have\" for delivery. Well, twenty minutes and fifty dollars later, we had two of the biggest pizzas I have ever seen sitting in my kitchen. We were eating pizza for days. And it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place makes food for people who don't really care about food. Tonight was my follow-up visit (since I always give a place a second try) and I can safely say I won't make that mistake again. The food presented doesn't match the photos on the menu. How can one overcook french fries and have them still be cold? If you want pizza, please try Roman Candle just a mile down the street. If Pizza Pit people read this, I might recommend you ask corporate to limit the menu so you can succeed with one or two items instead of serving a wide variety of overpriced garbage."}
{"text":"The newest addition to Pizza EXTREME (it's not really all-caps like that--I just like the emphasis) opened about a week ago on Monroe Street, just across from the stadium. I stopped in for a slice while I was running errands and wanted to check out their Grand Opening specials. Well, no specials to be found, at least not according to the counter help.   EXTREME Pizza Dude was friendly, however, and told me about their regular lunch specials--for $4.99 you can get two slices and a soda, a sandwich + chips + soda, a small house salad + a slice + soda, etc. I just went with a standard slice to go and ordered the Veggie. It was a decent, thin crust pizza. Not greasy but, sadly, not warm either. I sat outside in the sunshine (they've got about four outdoor tables with umbrellas) hoping that might heat things up a bit.   I'll check back again in a month or so when they've settled in to their new EXTREME digs and see how EXTREME things are going!"}
{"text":"If your getting the gyro plate, don't bother just get the sandwich. They both come with the same amount of meat and the plate is already in gyro form which it is not supposed to be. Guess that's what you get for buying a gyro at a pizza place."}
{"text":"Pizza Extreme is the best Chicago style pizza in Wisconsin. I grew up in the Chicago suburbs; eaten over my fair share of deep dish; and vote this pizza better than anything you can get in the Chicago land area. The crust is just sturdy enough to hold its shape without being greasy, heavy, or chewy.  The cheese is way better than the rubbery stuff they put in the IL pizzas.  The tomato sauce that dresses the top is perfectly acidic, sweet, and savory.  Put whatever topping you like. You can't go wrong.  The best part is, they'll par-bake it for you. We pick up a pie on our way home from Madison and finish baking it back in MKE."}
{"text":"The girl who answered the phone tonight was really rude. The website said that it was open until 11pm and it was just 10pm so I called to order. The girl answered the phone and said in a really snarky voice that they were closed. I said to her that the website said that there was still an hour but she said well its not and hung up on me. I like their pizza but not the poor customer service."}
{"text":"With all the talk of Rocky's, Toppers and Ian's, this place has in my opinion the best pizza... I've not tried their regular pizza, but their Chicago stuffed style is the best I've had in Madison.  And their sandwiches are very good as well. They have a fantastic selection for a pizza delivery place, and they deliver quickly."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has two stars. I love the people here, they are so friendly. My order is always correct, and I can't beat the value.   I have to order gluten free pizza and this place is the cheapest and best in town! They always double check to make sure my pizza is cut in squares as I request it to be, unlike pizza villa who screwed up my order like 6 times in a row. That's why I tried somewhere new, and I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"Stayed the weekend at HotelRed down the street and passed this place by on the walk to the bar on Friday.  As a native Chicagoan, I can't help but take notice of a place advertising pizza and gyros in the same location.  Obviously, this was a monumental opportunity to combine two of my favorite late night foods, and the experience would effect itself after an appropriately drunken beer fest the following day.  Anticipating my state of mind for Saturday evening, I did my research in the morning when my BAC was at a socially acceptable level.  To my surprise, Pizza Extreme neglects to include two of the most extreme of pizza ingredients on their menu: gyro meat and tzatziki.  Post beerfest, I walked over to Pizza Extreme and posited my plan to the guy behind the counter: I wanted a proper gyro pizza, cost be damned.  He informed me that he'd made a few in the past and that I'd surely be satisfied.  Once evaluating my seriousness (\"Of course I want tzatziki as the sauce.\"), he took my order and told me he'd have it ready in 15 minutes.  As I turned to walk out, he enthusiastically proposed including feta cheese.  A true buongustaio.  I returned shortly* to pick up my extreme pie.  It was made with care and sure to satisfy.  Quite honestly, it was the best specialty pizza I've had (take that, Ian's).  Seriously guys, put a gyro pizza on the menu.  *It should be noted that I returned with pizza from Pizza Brutta down the street.  The pang of betrayal was clear on my dear chef's face.  For that, I am truly sorry.  Alas, I associate with fools who were not nearly as enthused as I was for such refined melding of trans-Ionian culinary institutions."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe this isn't the best pizza. The one pie I had tried was the sausage mushroom melt, which was always delish! I tried another combination last time I ordered and it was cardboard-y and not so good. Meh."}

{"text":"While visiting Madison for a few days we decided to order pizza. This was tricky because most all the pizza places near us had bad reviews. So we picked PPE...we only had interaction with one of the employees and he was nice. The actual restaurant and dining area itself clearly needs an update/overhaul.  Okay, now let's talk pizza.... We ordered the special which consisted of 2 medium pizzas with 2 toppings great deal but for what we saved in costs the Pizza Pit did not make up for in flavor and quality.  The overuse of the oil made the pizza super greasy and therefor the crust was soggy and limp. I like to be able to taste the crust otherwise I should just put pizza toppings on bread.  We also ordered a side of garlic breadsticks and were pleased that those weren't too greasy.  I don't mind the use of oil when making pizza crust but I do mind spending money on something that I could have made myself that won't clog my arteries (note to self).    Actual order date 8/15/14"}
{"text":"Not a fancy spot.  Kind of small with six or seven tables.    I ordered a small pizza to carry out.  I was quoted a twenty minute period for cooking.  I arrived after 15 minutes as I was driving when I called the order in.  I paid and the pizza was out within minutes.  Pizza was hot and cooked well.    I have not been impressed with the delivery service in the past.  But I would order/pick up again."}
{"text":"Let me just say that the Parmesan Chicken Sub from Pizza Extreme is AMAZING!!! I love that thing, and have gotten it there off and on for years.  I just am giving this a 2 star rating because the last two times in a row I've been to the Fish Hatchery location, I've gotten terrible customer service (though in fairness, it's always from the same person).  The Raymond Rd location I've had exceptional service from, and the food is all the same (yummy!)"}
{"text":"So, we've ordered a few times from this location.  Not really great overall but edible.  This last time however was just terrible.  As the picture \"This is what you can expect\" shows it was as if someone spilled a pot of grease all over the pizza and breadsticks.  Both were soggy beyond any excuse. The name Pizza Pit used to mean something 30 years ago.  Now it's just a name people use to brand what loosely passes for pizza.  Not sure anywhere in this town has good pizza anymore, but I can say don't order from this location.  Unless you enjoy a pizza that looks like it should have been in National Lampoons Vacation. \"The dog pi$$ed on the picnic basket..\""}
{"text":"UPDATE: And they delivered 14\" pizzas, ugh. I paid for 16\" pizzas. I shouldn't have to argue with the manager for 10 mins to get the pizza I ordered for the price I paid. I didn't order one 1 topping pizza & one 2 topping pizza, I ordered the XL two topping pizza twins. All you have to do is fix it. Not spend 10 minutes telling me I'm wrong. Why would I order pizza I didn't intend to.  I'll start off with, this is cheap pizza. Ordering the \"pizza twins\" 2 16\" 2 topping pizza's for $24.99, $25.99 at some locations, you shouldn't be expecting gourmet pizza. I like Pizza Pit pizza, the sauce is good, not too sweet, they have crispy thin crust, and good portions on the pizzas but, they have the worst coupon system on the planet! The coupons & deals, like \"pizza twins\" all come out on the same flyers & magazines. You basically have to call each store to see if they offer that particular coupon, like BOGO13 which only 2 out of the 6 stores apparently offer it, yet all within 10 mils of each other. Then there are different \"brands\" like pit or extreme, so they offer different foods & specialty pizzas at each brand, like the \"5 Cheese\". Some coupons are good for some stores in town but not others, Some work online or over the phone, some are good for pickup or delivery only. or I could buy cheap $3 frozen pizza, yech. They used to have the best ribs, of course they stopped serving them. The wings are good, too many sauces to decide on. The gyros are ok. But again, unless you know what store you are ordering from, ALL THE SAME COMPANY, you can only get some things at some locations for some prices, worst uniformity or continuity of any franchise ever."}
{"text":"Location is everything.   Located on my usual stumble home, Pizza Extreme is quickly becoming my 3 AM stop of choice.  Bring a couple of friends, randomly select 5 items (ranging from chicken drummies to pizza of decent quality), and head home to play some Tekken.  If you're a couple 7&7's into your night, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First and last time I order. Ordered a small pizza and small order of wings. Delivery says 45-60 minutes which that's cool I'll just have a few beers first. this is at 7pm. About an hour and a half goes by before I decided to call. The guy says it's in route right now. Keep in mind I'm only a mile away. Another half hour goes by. I get a yelp update on my phone asking me how I liked my pizza? Unfortunately I still haven't received it. Finally 9:05 I get a knock on the door. I'm just happy because I'm starved. Open my pizza and you know how pizza looks after it's been sitting out a while, but you say \"what the hell? I'm still eating it\" that's how my pizza was. Dry and cold. So I start on the wings. COLD! Weren't even the right flavor. Ordered Siracha Buffalo and got hot buffalo. Not far off but not the point. Maybe I just had a bad experience, but I definitely won't order again. Good luck to those who do I hope your experience is better then mine."}
{"text":"So so so bad! Simple order online, website indicated 30-45 minute delivery time. After waiting 60 minutes I called and was told that it had just left and will be \"at your house within minutes\". After waiting another 30 minutes I called back and was given attitude by the girl on the phone after I told her I was not happy and wanted to remove my prepaid tip from the order. I decided to go out to eat with my 2 very hungry kids and emailed slicelife.com (their order processor out of NY) to cancel the order. Received an email back that they want to give me a credit in lieu of a refund - for food I didn't receive! Thankfully chargebacks are still a consumer right and we win over 80% of the time - probably 100% of the time since I never signed a receipt. I will never go to this restaurant or order from another restaurant that uses slicelife.com for order processing. AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived very near this west location of Pizza Extreme for seven months, and have been very leery of seeing what's behind the dark storefront in its strip mall location. Well, tonight I ventured in and was very pleasantly surprised. This is an interesting combination of a dine/take-out/delivery pizza joint, a coffee shop, and an ice cream shop.  The dark, cluttered storefront masks to a very cozy dining area. There are lots of big booths to sit in, it is well lit, and very well decorated with a cheery color scheme and art deco posters. There was one couple dining while we were in there around 7pm. There is free wifi so I think it will be a great place to hang for a while.   The staff was VERY friendly--I would give them six stars if I could. We had called our order in ahead of time, and after we told the guy on the phone we lived close, he said they would just deliver it and save us some trouble. We said no, we'd like to stop in and check the place out. Once we got there the guy introduced himself and said he'd be happy to help us however he could. He said whenever he works he could customize our pizza for us any way we wanted. Also, we had forgotten to specify we wanted a thin crust, and the lady at the counter said it was too late to make it thinner but she could still make it crispier. All in all, very friendly, helpful, but not overbearing service.   The pizza itself was very good. We had half spinach pesto/half garden vegetable. Each had a very distinct flavor, and we thought the tomato sauce was very flavorful and well seasoned. The crust was pretty thin (even though we hadn't specified \"extra thin\") and crispy. Not too flavorful, but I liked that there weren't huge crusty ends--just enough to grip a slice. The cheese was a little to think and chewy for my liking, but it still made for an overall solid slice. This location also serves Ancora coffee in the mornings and ice cream from the Chocolate Shoppe, and beer! We'll definitely be back for more..."}
