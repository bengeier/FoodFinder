{"text":"Top to bottom terrible experience.. Close your eyes and imagine this... Walking into a small, poorly lit bar that's over packed with music that blares so loudly that you can't even hear your own words leave your mouth as you speak. Now ordering food, is another story as it wasn't really much of anything to begin with. Hold onto your seat! For $8 you get access to a grand total of 5 chicken nugget sized pieces served by your choice of hipster. Moving to the bar now.. Someone I knew had ordered their local pilsner, calling it \"the pil\", which resulted in clueless looks since this is so vastly different from the expected \"the pilsner\". Flash forward, this now became a huge joke embarrassing this person but sending the entire bartending staff into an uproar- clearly they're in need of some good jokes. In conclusion, if a man- bun sporting , long t - shirt and obnoxious beaded chain wearing person who anxiously awaits to ridicule at the slightest comment you have, is your version of a good night then look no further!"}
{"text":"This was one of my worst experiences to date. I went there with a friend and she accidentally spilled her beer on the bouncer. She apologized while he threatened her and continued to berate her in front of the other customers. She did not feel safe and when she expressed concern over his reaction, he was unapologetic and called her a \"fucking bitch\" and told her to get out of his face. Needless to say, he has some anger issues. I would not go back, nor would I recommend this establishment. I should also mention that management was not helpful in addressing the situation."}
{"text":"The bounders so so unfriendly. They don't respect women or their long term customers. They have their friends do their job for them. They were willing to hit a woman and disrespect their customers. We have been going to locals only since they opened and they still didn't appreciate their long term guests. Once they kicked us out, the bouncers friends followed us and harassed us for about 5 minutes. To conclude, DO NOT GO TO LOCALS ONLY."}
{"text":"Yummy bar food + drinks, cool atmosphere & super nice bartenders (especially the guy w long hair! He was great). Definitely coming back next time we're in Toronto."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday to celebrate a friends birthday, even though we called to reserve a table, we had to wait in line for 2 hours, the bouncers keep all the guys and girls that they feel are not attractive in line for hours to show the place is busy, and they only allow attractive girls inside. Bouncer keeps walking the line and asking people to pay him$20 so they don't need to wait in line, Management and staff are extremely rude. I will never go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I got horrible food poisoning from the oysters!  The food was amazing but not sure it was worth the horrors we went through that night.  Please give me my money back."}
{"text":"To be fair I've only been here twice. 

When I first walked in there I was met with hostility. But once the waiter realized I was with a big group buddy finally treated me like I had money...

My friends really like the oysters here and the cheap wine.

Burgers are apparently shit. I haven't tried it myself but no one in my group finished their food and tried to pawn it off.


                       POSITIVES: 

-Cool atmosphere and a lot of good energy.

-Great for groups

-cheap oysters and wine

-Great music

                       NEGATIVES:

-Shit food

-Horrible service

-over priced 

                  GET THE OYSTERS."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Locals Only. Inside was super chill and we were able to grab seats right up at the bar. Bartenders were all super friendly and were quick to serve my friend and I. The only thing I didn't enjoy was how long we had to wait outside to get in. It was freezing cold and based on how much space was available inside the line should have moved much more quickly. Other than that - it was enjoyable. Loved the vibe inside!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on Sunday with the King St. Pub Crawl. The venue was very cool and had a chill atmosphere. We sat at the bar and were tended to with extreme care. All of our drinks were generously poured. As I was leaving to head to the next stop, my headphones had fallen out of my pocket. Once realizing the next morning that I had left them I called and left a message. I took a risk today going back to see if they could be there. To my surprise they were. It is so refreshing to know that the bar tenders at Local's Only hold themselves to a high moral standing. I will definitely be back and not just because I am a local."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar on King West...  my friend had a good description of it \"It's 2 cats with a demographic that is around 10-15 years younger\"  The music reflects that.

Bathrooms are a nightmare....  i think they have 4 individual stalls and the line can be long later in the night."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night to enjoy their buck a shuck oyster special. I had the impression from the guy who welcomed me didn't have the most friendly personality. I found our female server was more personable and seemed more pleasant and welcoming. They don't reservations so I had to come when it opened to secure a large table for my party. We ordered the Big Shebang which included a bit of everything on the menu. I think it's great that you can try a bit of everything on the menu but I found this deal not as ideal for groups as the portions were quite small. You literally only get 1 small box of poutine. I wish they included more portions to share with a group of friends. Overall, the dishes that came with this feast were good. Nicely seasoned and prepared. I would recommend bigger portions to make this more shareable for a group of people. Their buck a shuck oysters run everyday from 5-8PM and it's quite the deal. I really really enjoyed their oysters as they already come with seasoning. Overall, a good place to have some good food and socialize with friends. If you love oysters, this is one of the better places in the city for $1 oysters. Will definitely be back for more oysters!"}
{"text":"Why don't they have more cocktail selection? They were out of ingredients for 2 out of 4 cocktails they have on the menu. 
The drinks we ordered were great though I'd return just for that.
Other than that we liked the place, it was busy but not extremely packed. Overall we had a good time, but they should really step it up a notch!"}
{"text":"Showed up here randomly on a Tuesday evening with a dining/drinks companion and got pulled in by the oysters & wine. Little did we know that the best poutine ever to grace these tastebuds lay inside awaiting the moment of tastiness. Who would think to use Bechamel sauce instead of gravy? GENIUS. 
warning: the portion is notably WAY smaller than expected for some reason -- grab a few I guess :-s

The oysters were ok too I guess - I mean I usually like when there are horseradish, ginger, hot sauce [notably, stellar hot sauce but you may sweat so be aware of what you're getting into], and a few condiments to plop on but there was ginger and I probably could've asked for horseradish I guess, so yeah all in all it was good.  No pitchers here,  but half-price wine 5-8 is ok by me."}
{"text":"The bar itself is very cool with trendy artwork and decorations. However, they refused to serve me and my friends for absolutely no reason (or the reason may be that we were American -- fitting per the name).

We, a group of college students (11 total), walked into Locals Only on a Sunday night because one of our waitresses had recommended it. We handed over our ID's (we are all over the age of 19). 

We are all from different states and the bartender immediately refused to serve us because of our varying ID's. Another bartender on duty did a quick Google search and showed us her screen, taunting \"that's not what that state ID looks like!\" pointing to the outdated version of the New York state ID. 

They refused to get a scanner to verify our ID's and didn't even ask for a second form of ID. The first bartender took an attitude with one of our friends and kicked him out, threatening to get the police. All because we were from different states. THEN, the bartender started a physical altercation with one of our friends outside of the bar, pushing him and threatening to fight.

NOT acceptable."}
{"text":"Came here for oysters, the waiter made a mistake with the name which at first got me worried but they were legit some of the best I've had in the city. The sliders and chicken were good. The poutine was ok. The waiters are gorgeous and attentive. It was a bit chilly inside and the alcohol selection could have stronger game. I'd however totally come back for the oysters."}
{"text":"Locals Only is where the old Lou Dawgs used to be.  Apparently it's been open for about 2 months, but I never noticed it in the hood.

We popped in around 830pm on a Saturday night just before it started to fill up. The food menu consists of a selection of small plates with some Asian inspired flavours fused with some Mexican bites. You can try it all for sixty bones, which is what a buddy and I did, washed down with beer, cocktails, and whiskey. 

Overall, the food was good and surprisingly filling. Standout dish of the night was def the pork belly. This would be a great place to start the night. Staff are super chill. Will be back."}
{"text":"Always has a good crowd and good vibe. Food is really good for a bar of this kind. You wouldn't expect the attention they lay to the cuisine. Servers are all experienced. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service:
It was hard to flag down the bartender at times, but they are quick to make your order once you get their attention.

Ambiance:
It's a small underground bar, with a hipster-ish vibe to it. It's different from the other bars on King West, as you hardly see people in suits or ties.

Drinks:
They have a limited selection of beers on tap, which are all crafted beers. I am not a big fan of crafted beers, so if you like it then this is your spot."}
