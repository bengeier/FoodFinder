{"text":"They seem very ill prepared. I ordered my food over 2 hours ago and I still have not gotten my food delivered. I called twice and each time they said it was on their way. Although their service was very nice, their wait was ridiculous. I got my food 2 hours and 15 minutes later), it was completely cold, I am disappointed and will never order here again. The cannoli I ordered was only 1/4 filled!"}
{"text":"Chris, the owner, and staff are super nice and friendly! The artwork inside is unique. The pizza crust, ranch, & fried Oreos were delicious. Would've like more cheese on the pizza. Other than that it was yummy. We will definitely be back! Can't wait till they can serve booze :-)"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD! I walked in and met some friends not expecting much except a beer and a slice of pizza. Neither of the 2 people working the bar I was sitting at welcomed me or asked what I wanted. There was only 2 other people besides my friends in the entire place so it wasn't like it was too busy. I said excuse me numerous times to get the girls attention and she responded with \"ugh can you wait\". Finally I asked for a beer and a slice of pizza. After ten mins of her handling her receipts right in front of me, she gets me my beer. She comes back another ten mins later and says they don't have pep pizza ready and ask if it's okay to put pepperoni on a slice of cheese and I said yes. Now 20 mins go by and she says we burnt your slice of pizza. Possibly because they left it in there for 20 mins. I told her to let me pay for me beer so I can leave. Only then did they decide it was time to provide me with service and tell me they will give me my slice for free which I declined. Her excuse was that she was a driver and she's not used to doing that job. I'm sorry but even a simple greeting or apology for the wait would have made the outcome so much better. On a lighter note, the food looked good for the 45 mins I spent looking at the people next to me eat."}
{"text":"Food was good but man that service was soooooo slow. Had to wait more than 1.5 hrs for pizza"}
{"text":"The only place in tempe that I can get decent pizza. Slices are large and east coast style. I love this place all the staff are friendly and welcoming. If your on Mill this is hands down the best place for a slice and a beer"}
{"text":"Classic huge Philly pizza slices and cheesesteaks. Grew up on their original store on Baxter Avenue and was stoked to see one open up in Tempe. Open until five like the other ones and they brought the cheap orders of their delicious fried Oreos to Mill Ave too. Haven't tried delivery yet but, like their other locations in Louisville, this is a place I typically visit late at night after a show for a few slices and Oreos. Finally a LATE night spot in Tempe where you can sit down in a comfortable place."}
{"text":"4.3 out of 10 on the pizza 

MEDIOCRE at best! Digiorno would have put up a good fight and might have been better option. Crust is tasteless, bland. 3 dollar up charge for a weak amount of broccoli. 

MESSAGE to OWNERSHIP: 
Utilize your location and focus on the food. Anyone can open a \"pizzeria\" on mill. Seize the opportunity and make Spinelli's the best pizza joint in AZ"}
{"text":"Cool pizza parlor/bar. Portions are quite large for one slice and food is pretty good."}
{"text":"GREAT discovery. The pizza is amazing, really big slices, the prices are amazingly cheap, the servers are really cool. I really recommend this place, it's a must when you are in Tempe. On Tuesdays they have .75 cents beers, so come in early and have an awesome time."}
{"text":"I have been to this place hundreds of times over the last few years. The pizza is  so good,  especially when you are drunk. But tonight was different. The pizza was still good but, as I sat at the bar I happened to look up at the artwork and I noticed hanging above a black panther clock was a noose. You know the \"lynch black people\" back in the day type noose,  just hanging there from the ceiling. I looked around and at least 3 people working behind the bar were black so I asked one of them about it. He genuinely looked shocked. He had never noticed the noose hanging there. I watched him ask a couple Caucasian coworkers about it and they played it off like it was nothing. I could tell it bothered him the way it bothered me. He assured me that he would make sure it comes down by the next day. Now again I've been to this establishment a bunch of times and never felt any discrimination,  but the fact that someone thought it would be a good idea to hang a noose from the ceiling and management approved of it, I just don't know that I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"From all the good Yelp reviews, you would think this place is actually good place to dine. When my partner and I got there, there was no host to greet and seat us, nor was there a sign saying \"seat yourself\". So we decided to awkwardly seat ourselves. We waited about 10 minutes before someone finally acknowledged us. After ordering, we literally waited about 40 minutes for our food. Throughout this whole time, our server didn't even check on us. Only to bring our drinks. I would be understanding if it was crowded, but there were literally 3 other tables. The bar was pretty full though, but a quick 'your food is coming right up' would've been nice. We finally get our food (philly cheesesteak sandwich and a slice of bbq chicken pizza). The philly had no seasoning whatsoever. It tasted like I was eating plastic. The pizza was decent, but everything was cold once it arrived. I never would think it takes 40 mins to an hour to make a sandwich and a slice a pizza. What made things even more frustrating was a group of teenage girls came in, ordered an entire pizza, and were eating within 15 minutes. While attempting to eat this cold, flavorless sandwich another group of young people come in, and they are instantly greeted from one of the servers. The server was obviously friends with them because she ran to them and started dancing with one of the guys who walked in. So to summarize, no one greeted me and my partner, but they greeted their friends. We had to wait almost an hour for our food, which btw was only a sandwich and a slice of pizza, while a group of loud teenagers got their pizza within 20 minutes. Our food was not only bland but it wasn't even hot and fresh. I also had to tell another waitress to go get our waitress just so we can get our bill and leave.. This place is a disaster. Bad service and mediocre (at best) food. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, you have to wait for the bartenders at least 10 minutes. And they are pretty rude and condescending"}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza here is phenomenal and the ranch (for the pizza if you're into that) is equally so. This place has a couple weaknesses though: the music can be both deafening and awful, the delivery is inconsistent in the sense they don't deliver on time and you often have to call the place several times to even get a hold of someone."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a long night of drinking and my friends and I were starving. It was about 2 am and there was a pretty good crowd inside. At the risk of sounding old,  I'll say the music there is very loud and it was kind of annoying because we were wanting to wind down from our night out not go into another club..but..oh well.  The waitress came to take our order about 10 minutes after we sat down..then came back another 10 minutes later to ask us again what we had ordered..not a good sign.  We sat...and sat..and sat...waiting for the 4 slices of pizza we ordered. That's it..4 slices..nothing too crazy..one of them was even just plain cheese.  45 minutes later the waitress came to tell us she was going on a break and it would be about 5 more minutes before our slices came out. 20 minutes later we finally got our food.  I gave them 3 stars because I really liked the pizza..it is very close to New York style and that is a plus. But I won't be back..the service is awful and there are plenty of similar places with better service."}
{"text":"Pizza fries are a must. The pizza slices are huge as fuck. Good service and good drink specials."}
{"text":"Staff was very slow, tickets get lost and to just to make some fried Oreos took 34 MINUTES before they realized they never even got to it. Horrible experience and will stop ALL future orders via delivery from here on. Disrespectful and would take 4 minutes myself."}
{"text":"Great walk in restaurant experience, but a major let down when it comes to delivery. I can't believe how rude they were to us in regards of their cold, dry, disgusting pizza. I thought that their level of professinslism would carry over from the restaurant to the delivery side of things but boy was I wrong. They estimated 30-45 minutes for delivery but we actually waited for 1 hour and 5 minutes to be exact. We called about the pizza, and the manager Chris I believe his name is, he was extremely rude. I hate for this to have to be my first review on yelp, but you guys nailed it. Horrible service gets you that one star review. What a shame delivery experience was far from a reflection we had in the restaurant. 1 star! walk in never order from them."}
{"text":"The smell of pizza drew us in, the PBR made us stay. Taco pizza is the best I've ever had. Fried Mac n Cheese was so good. And free fried Oreos for checking in on Yelp. If I lived here I would be a regular.  The service was outstanding. They are very proud of their local pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was mediocre at best. Staff was very rude and tried to convince us to just have plain pizza because pepperoni or Any toppings would have taken too long...isn't the point of a business to make money? Wow lazy... is punk rock attitude part of this places charm? Seemed just like d-bags  to me..

I shall slap my friend who said referred me."}
{"text":"Should have called ahead and placed our order before going to pick it up. It's felt like it took for ever to get our food. The 15minute wait for the pizza wasn't the problem. The problem was it took another 15 minutes to get our fried oreros and fried smores. I would be more understanding if it were a busy night, however there was only about 8 other people in the place. By the time we left the pizza was lukewarm. The pizza itself was alright. Nothing special (we got the chicken bacon ranch), I think there should have been some kind of sauce on it, the whole 'za was on the dry side. But you can't go wrong with the fried goods."}
{"text":"Pizza slice is HUGE, open late. Staff is friendly. It's a bar so don't plan on bringing kids. Sometimes there is a house DJ but I haven't come here often enough to learn the schedule."}
{"text":"We got a large specialty pizza for $31 and a slice of specialty pizza for over $8...good, but a total rip off!"}
{"text":"Taylor is an awesome server...the customer service was amazing and the food was really amazing too"}
{"text":"I ordered online for delivery last night and had to call in to clarify on some details about my order and I found the staff extremely accommodating. Delivery time was a little long compared to other places but it's really not a big deal considering the time I placed my order. The pizza slice is ridiculously large and fit for a giant; it was delicious. I ordered a Caesar salad along with my pizza and its like any other Caesar salad, portion also very large. To top off my order, I got 2 fried smores but I wasn't able to break into them since my food stuffed me up. :( I left it in the oven and I'll have to try it for my late afternoon snack. All in all, I will definitely order from this place again! 

P.S. It might seem pricey but for as much food as you're getting, it's really freaking cheap."}
{"text":"We had horrible service. The employee stated any speciality pizza could be ordered by slice but failed to mention that you were charged per topping. Paid $25 for 2 slices and 2 drinks. Employees were swearing while we were seated behind them. And everyone unprofessional. Seemed at the time only employees friends were in the restaurant. Pizza was not worth the money"}
{"text":"There's pepperoni knots where awesome and a bit addictive, they still where excellent after the next day and warmed up through the microwave , the pizza slices are huge and half the size of a regular pizza, you get a bang for your buck, descent price for very good food, I tried the waffle and chicken pizza it was good put needed more toppings and it has a gravy sauce on it. Get extra toppings on it though."}
{"text":"Hello, Tempe.  You know you're in a college town when the bathrooms are unisex and just filth.  Restroom aside, this place serves delicious pie and love the art.  Came here on NYE for the block party and scored seats at the bar.  Ordered a sicilian and bf ordered slices of ham and pepperoni.  Food took awhile but this place was jammed pack at 10pm on NYE.  Sicilian was fluffy and delicious, sauce was just perfect -- the only thing it lacked was meat.  (Silly me, I thought a true sicilian came with pepperoni).  Bf's pizza slices were thin crust with the perfect amount of crunch and crispiness and toppings were fresh.  First time visiting Tempe, and glad we stumbled on Spinelli's."}
{"text":"I have worked across the street at a bar for almost a year. This place opened and was convenient and the food was really good. However they take forever to get you anthing. Their service is horrible.  I have ordered for delivery twice now and it has taken well over an hour for one pizza. I live ten minutes from the place. Every time I call to see where it is at they say it has just left... I told the girl who answered you said that 25 minutes ago... she said \"well it will get there\". Not professional and won't order again."}
{"text":"Had the pizza knots. Super good! Really cool punk rock theme. First time every coming here and I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"My friend was on the hunt for pizza, so drove until we found this little gem. We were seated right away, I ordered a ceasar salad with steak (I know, I know..I wasn't that hungry)..he ate the Barbecue Chicken Pizza and he ordered 2 slices. They are hugeee, like GIANT slices. He loved the onion rings as a topping. They have grenadine for Cherry Pepsi, it MUST be grenadine..so that made me happy too. 

It was clean and we watched cartoons. It was like being at home, but with delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Loved the mozzarella bites. My Friend from Canada visited with me and he loved the food.we definitely recommend this place for a quick bite and a nice way to spend lunch ."}
{"text":"I think this is either the first or second time I have left a review for somebody but I felt I really needed to make the effort.  We were having to stay a few nights in Scottsdale and after a real tough day decided to just go to our hotel room and order a pizza.  I was able to order online and they gave us a delivery time.  A few minutes later that time was changed to an additional half hour but we excepted it.  We ordered the Supreme pizza which I think is the most expensive one on the menu and then were charge a delivery fee plus had to pay the gratuity online with a suggested 15%.  This made this the most expensive pizza either of us had ever ordered.  We were alright with that because we were hungry and tired and just wanted good food delivered.   This ended up being the the most expensive and worst pizza we had ever had.  We both agreed that a dollar microwavable pizza would have been better.  We threw out over half of the pizza because there was hardly any toppings on it and it was hard.  While eating it my tooth started to hurt and the next day I noticed I had actually broken the tooth on the pizza, which happened to be attached to a bridge so will eventually cost be lots of money.  We will continue to tell everybody we know in the Phoenix area to stay away."}
{"text":"Waited for 40 minutes to get microwaved pizza that froze into its triangle shape in ten minutes. So not worth it. Don't go here if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Wow...what a great spot, love the high ceilings and great music playing. I stopped in last night an ordered a slice and a soda pop, I ordered the pepperoni, green peppers and pineapple, lots of cheese, yummy..that's my favorite for sure. The slice was HUGE !!, PERFECTLY PREPARED.The crust was awesome & didn't compete with the ingredients above. The staff was very nice, courteous and helpful to say the least. Really super nice people. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Oh my freaking god the service here is seriously terrible. Almost everyone working there is terrible at their job, besides the people that make the pizza, because the pizza is actually tasty but it's in no way worth the way you get treated. We literally waited for about 30 minutes until anyone even came to our table to take our order! That is insane. So I attempted to go up to the bar to order a slice of pizza and the bartender/server literally looked at me multiple times but kept on having his conversation with some others and ignored me. Finally a server came up to us and she was so rude while taking our order. Terrible service! I can't even begin to describe. Waiting over an hour to eat a slice of pizza is absolutely ridiculous. Don't bother with this place, go to Slices."}
{"text":"Their website shows a beautiful pizza (not a marketing photo) however for your $23 pizza you get a sparsely topped pie.  The flavor was good, just very poor value.  Check out the uploaded pics.  We ordered a pepperoni and a supreme. Both had very little toppings. Dissapointed and feel I was mislead. It was for a work lunch so we really couldn't return them. Total for just 2 pizzas, nothing else was $55. Not at all like advertised.  Too bad since I think if they topped the pizzas like they advertise it would have been great,  prob 5 star."}
{"text":"Great lunch! Their  pizza was delicious and the size is very generous! The service was good, although we were the only ones there. Hidden gem. My daughter fell in love with their Buffalo Chicken Pizza  Their salads are good portions also. Buffalo wings had a good tasty kick to them!"}
{"text":"Root Beer Beer Float.  That in and of itself is the reason to come here.  

There were a lot of national chains in this area, so we were looking for something more authentic to Arizona and came upon this dive. My friend said he had eaten there before and that it was really good, so I was stoked to go.  

I was expecting a regular pizzeria but when I walked in, I was glad to see it was a comfortable dive with quirky decoration.  There was a painting with a take on the last supper with PBR,  the bathroom was unisex and plastered with vintage 50s porn with hearts and whatnot covering any \"unmentionables\" along with 50s diner tables/chairs and there were neat skateboard light fixtures hanging above, etc.   My type of place.

PIZZA
For a slice of white pizza, it was $4.25 and it was delicious.  If you ordered one of the more creative pizza slices (my friend ordered a Taco pizza he thought was equally as delicious) it will cost you about $6-$8.    It was pretty standard/reasonable for a jumbo slice that is the equivalent of two large NY slices.

SERVICE
The bar staff were friendly, accommodating and super sweet.  I'm not from the area, so one of them even gave us some recommendations for places to go to afterwards, one being this pretty awesome gaming bar where apparently they had Reddit Prom."}
{"text":"For sure my favorite place on a Tuesday!! Famous .75 cent PBR!! Couldn't get any better :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery at 1am the other night. We were just outside the zone but for a couple extra bucks, they came to our doorstop. Excellent customer service from the person who answered my call to the person who delivered the food. We ordered the philly cheesesteak and the original stromboli.  Both were amazing! And not just cuz we were hungry at 1am. ;) The bread on the cheesesteak was super soft and meat was flavored perfect.  Only suggestion would be to have au jus with it but I was ok without. Pepperoni stromboli was really good too.  The crust was cooked just right and the inside was great. They served marinara and garlic dip with it which was nice. Very impressed with this place and love the fact they deliver till 5am. We work nights so we're usually hungry at odd hours of the night! Def will order again!!"}
{"text":"Came here because they were having a fundraiser for the victims of the Orlando shooting. I think first and foremost this says a lot about this business and that alone drives me to support them. 

However, the pizza was delicious. The best pizza I've had in the area for sure. My friends and I shared a pizza and it was so large it was the perfect amount. I can't wait to come again after a night of partying since it is open so late. We also got the deep fried Oreos and those babies are dangerous! I didn't even know what to think about them when we ordered them but they were just so delicious. I could easily \"accidentally\" eat a whole basket myself.

The inside was surprisingly large and unique which I liked. Our waitress helped us quickly and our food came out in a good amount of time! 

Not only would I come here again, I am excited to come again. Which may or may not reflect poorly on me haha."}
{"text":"Popped in for a couple drinks, didn't get to try the food but everyone there was pretty fkn cool. Gracious and super attentive, they're doing it right. Gotta go back for some pizza and deep fried goodness"}
{"text":"Some friends and I stopped here for food last night and there was quite a line. As we are waiting, a man and woman (assuming a couple) cut my group in the line. One of the women I was with called them out for cutting, and the man flew off the handle about being \"disrespected.\" He states that because he worked there, he could cut whenever he wanted. He was carrying a large camera, so unsure if he was a photographer for the business or if that was just a lie. He and my friend continued exchanging words, and finally she conceded by telling him to get his food first just so the argument would stop. He continues screaming at her, literally in her face, and then he proceeds to speak to the men in our group about allowing her to speak to him that way and disrespect him - at that point I remind him it's 2018 and women can speak for themselves. He proceeds to get in my face at that point, screaming \"go suck a d***\" over and over again. My group decided to leave at this point because he was completely belligerent and incredibly aggressive. During this entire exchange, which lasted 3-4 minutes or so, nobody interjected. There were employees nearby, and not a single person had anything to say. The sudden and aggressive behavior was worrisome, which is why we ended up leaving. If this person is truly an employee, he should be fired. My group and I will never return to this business because of this situation and lack of concern by the employees working."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty decent but it was difficult to get our check after the massive bar fight broke out. 

I really enjoyed the meal part of our \"meal\" but otherwise the experience was sub par. Most of our group kind of lost their appetites when people started throwing chairs, tearing off each other's shirts and punching one another. Seeing people walking around afterward with gashed faces and bruised bodies didn't help either. I know it's hip to have an ambiance like second rate tattoo parlor that will give its customers hepatitis but that doesn't mean you need to attract the same clientele. You're a pizza place, stick to what you're good at.

The service was also agonizingly slow, albeit not as slow as the Tempe police department's response to the various 911 calls. It's cool guys, take your time, it's not like the town is flooded with tourist around New Years and this might give the city a bad reputation."}
{"text":"We were hungry after the Tempe Oktoberfest and at midnight, it was one of the few restaurants in the college town that didn't have a crazy line to get in. It's a cool vibe on Fridays with a DJ spinning upstairs. We got the chicken and waffles pizza slice for about $5 which was big enough to feed two people! Super delicious combination with a hint of maple syrup!  What a creative idea! It totally hit the spot for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a late lunch. Was craving a meatball sub.  It was excellent. Fresh, perfectly toasted sub roll, with plenty of extra marinara. Meatballs were perfectly done. Fun and relaxed atmosphere.  I shall return when the craving hits again. Fried Oreo dessert is also very good."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and the slices are huge but thin. Beer is normal price. Interior is creative. Cheese bread was not great. Place stays open until 5am. Worth a visit and the people that were working were very nice."}
{"text":"They hung up on us and yelled at my friend yesterday smh bad service and been on hold for an hour"}
{"text":"Cold reheated pizza - nothing special.  However it is the attitudes that will keep me from coming back.  I would never recommend this establishment to my worst enemies.  The owner of any small business would realize the importance of repeat customers.  The employees of spinelli's have it all wrong.

Save your money go to slices down the street"}
{"text":"Spinelli's is a solid, quick, inexpensive pizza option. It stands out from the competition on Mill with HUGE slices that are thin enough for both me and my boyfriend to finish and still be able to take advantage of their typically great beer specials. $5 domestic pitcher on game day! Happy with the experience overall."}
{"text":"Such a sick spot. The atmosphere is super chill! Delicious food! Always a great time here!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza and the deep fried oreos were the perfect ending."}
{"text":"Great speciality pizzas!! Hospitality is also excellent, really recommend coming here"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the children running this establishment have never been taught what real customer service is.. I hate giving negative reviews as much as I hate poor customer service, but I guess they go hand in hand., so therefore, screw this place.. starting from the beginning, the \"dude\" on the phone was vague about the price. Uuh, it'll be around $30 and some change.. That's fine. I have cash. Ok, 1:40 min later, cold pizza arrives with the delivery drivers glorious comment, \"well the weird thing is, I don't have change.\" Im pretty sure that's a job requirement!!!  They make u hand over the pizza, cold pizza, old pizza, to come back with change, what? For Colder pizza.!?! So whack"}
{"text":"Frankly, I am shocked at the good reviews. Maybe because I am not a student visiting for drunk food at 2am. Went for lunch, it was filthy and the staff was extremely unfriendly. Run down, smelled awful, and we found the food to be mediocre. I cannot understand what people like about this place unless it is the late night party scene, which we did not experience."}
{"text":"So!

Craving a good quality slice of pizza in the middle of the night? Look no more!
This spot has a great location (Right by Mill Ave). 
I been here multiple times and never had a bad experience. It does get crazy busy after 1am, be ready to wait at least 30 min.

Prices can get little bit high if you pick your own toppings, my roommate once payed like $12 dlls for a slice lol

They have a small beer selection, but it does the trick. 

In overall, this place is great for a late dinner and fix your cravings. This is not a gourmet spot, but definitely a must drop by if you go bar hop to mill ave.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best place to go after a night of drinking at Mill  Plus Toni is the best server!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, the food is awesome, and the staff is great. aside from having to stop a drunken fight while ordering out. I would recommend the place whenever you can. deep fried Oreo's? BOMB!"}
{"text":"Pizza was solid

Prices are fair

Hours are convenient

Delivery through Yelp/Eat24, extra convenient 

You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"So shit was fire. Our waitress Toni is tight. Great pizza. 10/10 would do again. Your blowing it if your not here! Chicken bacon ranch would make trump's hair piece fall off. Pizza so fire hitler wouldn't need an oven anymore."}
{"text":"Really really enjoy the pizza. People are freindly. I'd recommend it to everyone. My wife loves it so much its the only place we go when she wants pizza."}
{"text":"I can see why people would love this place. Hot fresh food open after the bars. As someone who made pizza along with other fast food for years, however; I found my pizza fries to be on the bland side. No seasoning besides what is in the sauce which tastes the same as canned commercial pizza sauce. In dire need of salt. I hope a passion for food thrives here soon it has potential."}
{"text":"Toni is fucking awesome. Great east coast service. Love it. Atmosphere is perfect. Philly fries are fire."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of the best customer service experiences I've ever had in the valley. Shawn is hands down the best host and I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Great food. Great drinks. And GREAT music. Try the Mr. Pinnaple by San tan or have Shawn recommend a drink."}
{"text":"I like that they have cheap beer but the pizza is overpriced. I also like that it is very spacious and the live shows they do sometimes is a pleasant experience. Since I'm rating it as a pizza establishment I have to give it three stars."}
{"text":"We came in to the restaurant and after about 10 minutes after we ordered I set a timer because it was taking so long, to cut to the chase we waited about 30 minutes for 1 large pizza while I sat around and watched the hostess play patty cake with her fellow co workers. This restaurant is a joke, the pizza is delicious but the prices and service dive bomb this place into the ground."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance! Amazing place, great service, delicious food! The slices are huge and more than filling, definetly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm only really a fan of their cheesy bread: 1) Because it's massive and could feed a small village for a few days and 2) their pizza dough is on point.  I always ask for their ranch because I think their butter garlic and marinara sauces are mediocre.

Their pizza is okay but not anything spectacular (I've only tried the generic ones -- I'm not into the crazy toppings they offer).

I've only had Spinelli's delivered and that's been interesting to say the least; 3 out of 4 times, the delivery was painfully slow."}
{"text":"The food is really good for a good price...I got the White Pizza and the Chicken and Waffle Pizza. Chicken and Waffle was the best of the two would recommend trying it"}
{"text":"Best bar and pizza place in the whole valley. Just don't park behind Spinelli's it's a private parking lot to a business that hasn't been open for 5 years and have a tow co. patrol the lot and take cars for no reason. It doesn't belong to Spinellis."}
{"text":"The Worst Tasting Pizza I have had in a long time!  I don't know how you can make bad pizza, but this place does. My guess is that they are using cheap ingredients. The cheese had no flavor.  The service was good and the beer was cold, but I don't recommend their pizza."}
{"text":"Where to start. I have been to Spinelli's about 5 times in the past few months and there is always something to be desired. The customer service and the employees here are awesome; always taking the time to ask how the food tastes and maintaining a very positive and uplifting attitude. The problem, however, is the food. The pizza is often dry and flavorless (with the exception of a few different types). In addition to the mediocre pizza, the water on tap literally taste like sewer. While they aren't the only place that doesn't have normal tasting water, this is a pet peeve of mine considering 99% of the time I only drink water at a restaurant. Solid 3 stars for the cool layout and great employees."}
{"text":"Best pizza place ever! Sweet open mic with lots of performers. Their fried Oreos is the best. Chase rocked it on stage! Rock on Chase!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I've never eaten here. Yet,they have my money. Sorry but most places that have good service will find a way to feed you when you pay for it. Not here tho.don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I only ordered a slice of Sicilian, some fried Oreos, and drinks.  All showed up hot, fresh, and was a very nice treat.  Good delivery and the driver called without any problems."}
{"text":"REALLY REALLY good pizza. Very laid back and located right off of Mill Ave so it's very laid back. What's great, is that this place is open late so you can enjoy a yummy slice if pizza after a night of partying. A slice of pizza is appx $7 and a box is appx $25. I wouldn't suggest bringing kids, due to the bathroom being lined with photos of naked women!"}
{"text":"Walked past this place getting ice cream next door and saw slices. Grabbed just a plain slice of cheese to go. It was $5 and change. Mind blown, but figured it should be good if it's going to be that expensive. Big slice. Paper thin in the middle. Light sauce, bland. Lighter cheese, bland. Crispy like a cracker. For $5, Little Caesar's has this place beat."}
{"text":"I ordered Spinelli's Pizza to be delivered to my friends house on a Saturday night... at first I ordered a large Supreme pie and an order of chicken tenders and I was told the total would be $39 and some odd change and was shocked by the price. I admit I ordered without looking at the menu prices first but was taken back by the price. Although it *seems* (I'll get into that later...) like quality ingredients, $27 for a Supreme is still really expensive. I changed my order to a large Pepperoni and the total was $26 something... much more reasonable. The delivery was quick and I gave the driver a $10 tip. To my dismay, however, the entire bottom of the pizza was burnt black. Obviously my friends and I had been drinking a little that night and were hungry so they ate the pizza anyway (yes, we did consume the product but it was basically our only option at 4 A.M. with no D.D.'s available)...go hungry or eat the pizza) and I ate the chicken, which was DELICIOUS.
I debated whether or not I was going to call in and make a formal complaint. I've worked in the restaurant business for years and I hate complaining, but serving clearly burnt food to people who have been drinking got on my nerves. I hope they just didn't notice it was burnt but really? the reason why i wrote it seems like quality ingredients is because I couldn't really tell through the taste of burnt dough....
Anyway, I finally called the manager because it was on my mind a couple days later and he gave me a little attitude because I didn't  \"call sooner\" and I explained I'm not one to like to call with complaints but I thought he should be aware. I joked that I hoped they thought we wouldn't notice because it was Saturday night at 3 A.M. and clearly people in Tempe are usually socializing with drinks and friends. This was the wrong joke to make as it seemed to anger him. He basically offered me a free slice of pizza if I came in... no thanks. A proper business would offer a free pizza to replace to burnt one that was sent out. Bad customer service. I guess I was punished for being shy and debating whether or not I should even call. I've had their pizza once before and liked it. This experience wasn't a positive one though. I'll probably try them out again in the future because everyone makes mistakes and has off nights but they really need to make an effort to take better care of their paying customers."}
{"text":"Nothing like onion rings on your pizza at 3am  so bombbbbb

We had amazing service even this late in the morning. We had gotten 3 slices of the BBQ chicken and 1 pepperoni and they accidentally brought out a cheese, but quickly fixed it. Plus they us a Spinelli's sticker with Eazy E on it.  this spot is"}
{"text":"I saw a lot of \"loved it\" and \"hated it\" reviews for this place.

I came down for the Thursday night comedy show.

Food was great. I came in so hungry and thought I could eat a ton. I ate one slice of pepperoni and the pepperoni knots and I was stuffed. It also put all the \"I hated it\" reviews to bed for me -- the food was excellent.

I think the audio for the comedy show could be better. There was plenty of volume but but it was hard to tell what they were saying at times because of distortion/echo"}
{"text":"Jacob was our server. John Travolta from Pulp fiction was the security guard. Jacob did a fantastic job. A great personality and all around a pleasure to talk with. My wife got a salad and a slice for me. Good food. A great post game bite."}
{"text":"Visiting area and I was in the mood for pizza.  I checked out top places in Tempe and found Spinelli's Pizzeria in the top 10.  It was a short walk from the light rail to their front door.  
I was a little concern if the kitchen would still be serving at 10 pm but was very pleased they make pizzas until 5 am.
Seating was no problem.  They had a DJ playing music which was okay but a little loud.  Service was outstanding and great with suggestions.  I remembered to check in and was rewarded with a free dessert.   Now the hard part was deciding what to do for dinner.
We went with the pepperoni knots and a meat lovers pizza.  Pizzas are 18 inches and hand tossed to a thin crust.  We did a full pizza even though we could have gotten a slice, but we wanted leftovers.  As a note, the slices were about the size of a quarter of a full 18 inch pizza.  However you do the math, they were huge.  
Knots were great and flavorful.   Pizza was also great.  It was not greasy, had a thin crust and sauce did not have a sharp acid taste but was sweetish. 
Our dessert was deep fried oreos.  Sweet and nice way to end meal.  Yes, this time I did save room for dessert.  I was glad we found Spinelli's, they did a great job at satisfying  that pizza craving."}
{"text":"First experience and the delivery guy was on point, arrived in like 20 minutes and was super friendly! My slice of pizza was so big it came in a large pizza box :) Food was delish!   Our new favorite place for sure!"}
{"text":"this restaurant is lucky i'm even wasting my time... and i'm only writing this because the food is actually pretty good when it isn't soaked in sauce, cold, or when my order is correct which is almost never! but i am giving them a 1 star due to the fact that there is only 1 person in this whole restaurant who is professional and or capable of doing their job properly! shout outs to that one dude lol"}
{"text":"Great service, great pizza! Happy, happy, happy! Cool music inside. Great beer prices.
Deep fried oreos free if you check in on yelp."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, never again. Bought the veggie Stromboli and it is by far the worst meal I have had. Overpriced, excessive wait time (took 40 min for my order) and horrible food. The Stromboli was greasy and weirdly soggy. The dough has no flavor whatsoever and after 40 min I was served undercooked dough. Ended up throwing the Stromboli away because it was not even close to edible. After spending $10 on lunch, hungry was the last thing I expected to feel. Avoid this place if you want good food. I would give this place negative stars if I could. My friend ended up throwing his second slice of pizza as well."}
{"text":"Probably the most garbage slice of pizza I've had in a while.  I used to send people here but this pizza I just had tasted like it had been sitting out for 8 hours."}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni slice and the slice was huge and very flavorful. Service was good, would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I love this place. Been here 3 times so far, for a post-mill bite. Every single time I've been here, the staff has been very courteous and just plain awesome! The pizza is always fresh, interesting, and delicious. Most people who are reviewing negatively don't realize that you order pizza from the counter. Derp, pay attention. Anyways, make sure you do that. Don't just sit down cause that's not how it works. The ranch I'd also fantastic! Give this place a try for sure!"}
{"text":"The hotel room service was closed by the time I got to my room. They advised this place delivered pizza - I asked for the delivery time before ordering  and was told 35 minutes. After an hour, I called to check the status of my pizza and the guy was extremely rude \"I don't know who told you that\". He advised the delivery driver was on his way back from another delivery  and would be on his way. 
Over 90 minutes later they finally arrived, stating I didn't pay - even though I gave my credit card over the phone when I ordered. After I told the driver that I was disappointed about the wait and service, she asked if I wanted to give her a tip..  My food was an hour late, you lost my payment, you were rude when I called and you're asking for a tip?? I would have given her a much larger tip but a little customer service would have gone a long way! An apology for the wait, an apology for having to take my credit card  info again -
Instead I was treated like I was a burden. We are here regularly and from now on, this will be the last place I order from!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, and it was busy. Not a big deal, it's Mill Ave on a Friday night. Everywhere is busy. It's a college town. My friends and I sat down, and waited 15 minutes for service. The only reason the server finally came over, is because we got another employee to bring someone over. I had gone up to the bar and asked if I could order food there, and was told no. Only for takeout. Well, that guy lied to me because I saw several people going up there and getting pizza slices and bringing them back to their tables. 

I ordered two beers since they were having specials, and was asked for my ID again even though I had on a wristband they made me get. Okay, fine. Then when I go back to get two more beers, I'm told I can only get one at a time. I said I just got two, and they try to tell me the liquor law states that I can only get one at a time. ANOTHER LIE. Seriously. You really expect every single person in the party to go up separately to get drinks when it's that busy? I just wanted two beers. I've been to bars all over Phoenix and nobody else has ever pulled that crap. 

Then we finally get to order, and it takes OVER AN HOUR for us to get some pizza slices. We were pissed. Then, on top of the wait time, the pizza was HORRIBLE. I've eaten at so many different pizza places in the Valley, and I swear to god even Pizza Hut has better pizza than this place. You can't even use being busy as an excuse for the pizza slices taking so long. All we had was cheese, and I have been to Venezia's Pizzeria in Tempe hundreds of times, and even on a super busy Friday night, I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my order when dining in. No excuses. 

Servers/bartenders were rude, food was terrible, and the atmosphere is pretty douche-y/pretentious. I will never waste my money here ever again. Your business won't last long if you keep this crap up. You need servers that know how to handle several tables at once and can keep things organized. Seriously... I know this wasn't your first Friday night on Mill Ave. I have no idea how you don't have your crap together."}
{"text":"Perfect for a couple quick sliced after hanging out on Mill St all night.  Gets a little crowded on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Came to try this place out for the first time, ordered a large pepperoni pizza. We waited over an hour before finally inquiring at the counter where our order was. There was confusion between the waitress and the manager and the kitchen whether our order had been placed or the kitchen never received it. We were requoted and still didn't receive our pizza in the time. Finally we were offered a free slice of pizza while we waited for our pizza to be done. An hour and a half after ordering we finally received our original order and left. Not likely to return / recommend"}
{"text":"I usually have an awesome experience at Spinelli's! However, today I went with a group of people and not only would our server not answer our questions or repeat the menu options, our order took at LEAST an hour. We ordered one pizza. We waited while people came in and our, got served, paid, and left, and we waited to get served, while reminding our server we were still waiting for our food. We asked for the manager, and when speaking to him, he said we were only waiting for a half hour which is only because our server clearly didn't put in our order or forgot about us. Left no tip and definitely don't plan to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I am a New Yorker and feel that my opinion on Pizza is more significant than yours. This is the best dough, best cheese, closest to a true NY slice than anywhere else in the state. Yes thats a big statement, go put something in your mouth that I can't say on here if you disagree. They deliver until 5am, their pizza is the best, and the wings and everything else can't be complained about. The 4 stars only because their sauce isn't the best for reheating. Have to eat their pizza hot to get the best taste. All good - it's still better than jokes like NYPD and Streets of NY. A place that serves slices but doesn't have a slice pie going and prepares all their slices to order shouldn't have the letters NY anywhere near they're name."}
{"text":"Great pizza ANNNNNNNND GREAT people!!! We came here as pizza lovers from la and we love this place and the amazing pizza!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. What they serve shouldn't even be considered pizza and their service is consistently offensive. Take the hipster high road and at least treat customers with dignity and respect. That is the least they could do given how terrible their doughy, minimal cheese pizza is. I'm a Mill Ave. local and will never spend a cent here again."}
{"text":"Our wait was long but the pizza was good! The Philly steak sandwich (as a hoagie) was good too. I'd give more stars except the Cesar salad was lettuce, croutons, packet dressing and Parmesan cheese from a can and the breadsticks didn't have any flavor. I'd go back for the pizza though. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place for a cheesesteak and quick lunch.  Good assortment of beer and liquor also. 
Will come. Back again."}
{"text":"Wicked awesome place. Amazing art, even better pizza. Traveled here from New England - and so excited to find a PA pizza joint."}
{"text":"Late night pizza with all the extra cheese, peppers and ranch you could ever want?  GREAT! Not the best place for a refined dinner, but after a few beers and you want to feel like you are in college again, hit spinelli's!"}

{"text":"Used to love Spinellis after a night of being out on Mill but after my experience last night I won't be back no matter how good their pizza is. Went in, ordered my pizza, ate, and left outside to grab my Uber. Realized 3 seconds after ordering it that I had to go pee so I ran back inside to use the restroom. Was immediately stopped and interrogated by \"security\" saying I couldn't go upstairs and use the bathroom even though I had clearly bought pizza 20 minutes ago and had the 'x' that they wrote on my hand to enter the restaurant. Finally, my friend pulled up the receipt on her phone and they let us upstairs with no question. It's sad that these security guards care that much about their job to question 2 girls for 10+ minutes just for a bathroom use. Also, when I went upstairs to the bathroom it was in horrendous conditions and didn't even have TP on a holder or paper towels. Needless I say I really should've gone somewhere else to avoid the 1,500 calorie pizza, security that takes their job too seriously, and dungeon bathrooms."}
{"text":"Terrible place with disrespectful staff. I ordered a pizza and was given different ETA's by different staff members. After waiting 45 minutes and calling back, the \"manager\" (who I'm more convinced was a 14 year old) was very disrespectful toward me and told me they were doing the best they could. Clearly their best is sub par. I cancelled my order. Don't go here unless you're desperate."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Get the Philly Fries 4 sure. Toni is one of the best Bartender/Servers that I have ever met. Friendly, genuine, and super informative about the area."}
{"text":"3 slices cost $16.50 U.S.American dollars..  I thought the girl was joking when she quoted the price.  Slices were already in oven or I would have cancelled.   This is insulting, and robbery.  2 cheese slices, one pepperoni.  These weren't even loaded slices.   Sauce was flavorless, pepperoni slice had three inches of crust.     I want my money back.   F@ck this place."}
{"text":"As a late night location I did not expect the quality of service I receive from this location. Our server Audrey was a pleasure to deal with; not only explaining the menu, but staying attentive to our table. This venue provides the upmost service and selection in food. 

As a resident of Mill Ave I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"How did I go my entire ASU career without trying Spinelli's?? Well I have now and I will definitely keep coming back. After a night out on Mill it just in Tempe it's the perfect thing to munch on. Prices for their slices are pretty expensive considering how thin the crust is, but it's honestly really good pizza. The BBQ chicken pizza is my favorite, with onion rings on top who can resist? Lines can get pretty long after bar close, but they are open until 5am so you get your pizza no matter what. Great atmosphere and friendly staff, one of my new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza go-to spot. (Must try \"The Walk of Shame AKA Breakfast Pizza\".) The specialty slices are huge!!
There's a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it and you know, you can't rush good art!
My husband and I really enjoy the wall art and the service is really chill."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Amazing service!!! Went out of the way for our kids and the food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The Philly with wiz is one of the best I've ever had. I'm also a huge fan of the pizza. The slices are humongous and I actually really enjoy the thin style. Some of the pizza prices seem high but that's for the entire massive pizza with quality ingredients. If you still want to pinch pennies, they can be sold in slices and are very reasonable. One of the owners, Sean, is a genuinely nice hardworking guy. Ive had the pleasure of speaking with him several times now when I go in. He's very passionate and told my friend and I about the fresh hand made pizza dough, authentic sweet tea from Philadelphia and commitment to quality. I've enjoyed every visit thus far and everyone I've taken or told to go has been very impressed. I highly recommend everyone give it a shot."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!!!! Definitely one of the best pizzas I've ever had.... and i am from the east coast and can say this is legit east coast style pizza.... i highly recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"So if your on Mill Ave on a Tuesday this place is a must with their 75cent 16oz PBR! That's a deal! Not to mention their slices are 'bigger than your face' and that's not a understatement, unless your name is Andre the Giant, and even then it might be accurate! For being a new face on Mill Ave I think they're going to fit in nicely."}
{"text":"I will definitely be ordering again. I got a Philly cheesesteak and it definitely reminded me of the ones back home in philly."}
{"text":"Okay hooligans, listen up. Spinelli's is bomb af. Want a slice of pizza as long as your arm? Spinelli's. Want fried Oreos? Spinelli's. Want somewhere to lay low and chill when all the bars and clubs close?? Spinelli's. Literally have never had a bad experience here and the people are Awesome. With a capital 'A'. Okay, and let me just throw this out there-Chicken and Waffle Pizza. I'm gonna let that sit with you guys for a minute. Did that sink in? Good. Now here's what you're gonna do. You're going to get yourself over to Spinelli's right now. Jump in your car, call an Uber, ride a horse, I don't care. Just get there. I'll wait here. So now that you're there, take it all in. Okay, now here's the hardest part-decide what kind of pizza you want. I usually go for classic pepperoni but they're all damn good. Find out if Anthony is working. If he is, you're in luck because not only is he a boss, but he makes the best recommendations. If not, no worries, you're still in good hands. Once you've ordered your pizza and other delicious noms, it's time to get yourself a drink. \"Why\" you ask, well young grasshopper, because the bartenders here know what's up, that's why. What's that? That's your pizza, fool! I hope you know what to do from here. Eat that sinfully delicious slice and bask in the glory of Spinelli's. Your life is now complete, you're welcome. *mic drop*"}
{"text":"Whoa. This place is amazing. The cheesesteak was the best I have ever had, with the bread setting it apart. Apparently they fly in their bread from the same place that makes bread for Pats in Philly. Pizza was great too, super thin, but with tons of flavor. Can't wait will they serve alcohol soon. What's even more amazing is they are open and deliver until 5am, crazy! I'm going to need to limit myself to how often I come here, it's that good. Service was great and the graffiti / decorations are awesome. Free 1 hour parking at Hayden square parking garage."}
{"text":"Omg, the food was so delicious, haven't had great strombolli in years sooo happy;-) would gladly come back:-)"}
{"text":"Love Spinelli's!! Been coming here since they first opened and honestly it's the best pizza on Mill Ave!! And I work on Mill so I would know I've been to every spot. Also love the fried Oreos. Definitely try if you visit! Lol"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Pretty awesome ambiance here. I come for the pizza usually but have had the salads. Kinda reminds me of those pizza shops in New York. I can usually only handle one slice of pizza. It's the size of a small skateboard hahahaha"}
{"text":"Went to Phoenix for the weekend to attend a music festival and last night after being exhausted from the festival and not eating for 12 hours we decided to order something that could be delivered and found this place on Yelp. We ordered a large pie and sample appetizers. The delivery time was estimated to be 45-60 minutes which is a lot but we figured they'd be busy since the festival had just ended. More than an hour passed and our food had not arrived. We called & was told the guy had just left with our food. Waited longer & I even fell asleep while waiting. Called again and was told he was nearby. Almost 2 hours later we finally received our food only to open a pizza box with a burnt, cold, & hard pie! It was horrible! If I'm ever back in town I will never order from this place again !"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in AZ because of how different some of their pizza is from other places. The staff is extremely polite whether it be 5pm or 2am, they're always patient. I'd recommend the taco supreme pizza!"}
{"text":"Cool college place vibe.  The pizza slice was huge, about a 1/4 of 14 inch pizza.  I got sausage, it was loaded.  The crust is very thin, you have to fold the slice to eat it."}
{"text":"When this place opened it was amazing.  The owner was always there, walking around, chatting up customers, & the staff was super friendly.  
Well, things have gone down hill drastically in the two years since my last visit.  
The place was empty, first off.  The staff was sitting at the bar watching tv.  The female bartender looked annoyed & put out that she had to get up & wait on us.  The menu also seemed different, less choices possibly? Anyway, we ordered the chicken parm sandwich & a cheesesteak with wiz & lettuce.  ---- the bread was toasted... Overly toasted.  The chicken parm & cheesesteak were more bread than meat & the chicken parm was dry & needed more sauce.  The bartender (we ate at the bar) was barely pleasant.  I was so so sad bc I really used to love this place.  Wish it could go back to the same quality as when they opened."}
{"text":"Service couldn't get any worse.  Sitting at the bar, couldn't even get a dinner salad delivered within 45 minutes.  Ended up cancelling my order and leaving.  Terrible,horrible,lame place."}
{"text":"I thought the point of selling pizza by the slice was to sell what you happen to have at a cheap price. Would have never have thought that you would be charged for toppings on a slice that was premade, that you don't have a choice over. Ordered two slices, the size of the slices are misleading, they look huge but it's really thin.  75 cents a topping, ended up paying twice as much as I thought I would. Two slices came out to 13 bucks, I should have paid closer attention to the menu.  Should have known better than to think I was getting a deal on mill ave. Ordered fried oreos, never received them."}
{"text":"This is a preliminary review of Spinelli's Pizzeria in that it only involves their delivery service and items ordered online for delivery to the house. To be fair, this restaurant will be reviewed again in person at a future time and the rating may change at that time.

One of the things that attracted me to this restaurant is that they will deliver until the wee hours of the morning. They don't shut down until 5 a.m. 

The best cheesesteaks I have eaten are in Philly, so I ordered a Cheesesteak Stromboli for myself and a regular Cheesesteak Sandwich for companion. 

The cheesesteak sandwich is served on a roll imported from Philly, and can be had with a choice of 3 different cheeses. Veggies are optional but not charged for.

The Stromboli reminds me of a calzone in that the fillings are inside of a stretched piece of pizza dough. Again, veggies are optional but available at no additional charge.

At $10.50 for a normal Stromboli and $19.50 for a large, the prices seemed a bit steep, but a good sandwich or Stromboli can be worth the money.

I ordered our sandwiches, keeping in mind that the restaurant posts that delivery takes between 45 minutes and an hour. Two hours later our food had not yet arrived. I called the restaurant to inquire about our order and they said it would be ready to sent to us in about thirty minutes. Almost three hours went by before our order came. Not exactly one hour service, and the food was lukewarm. Putting it in the oven for about 15 minutes helped immeasurably with the flavor.

The sandwiches were of fair size and quality, but in my opinion nothing special. Perhaps eating in the restaurant will reveal a different experience.

I must admit I was not very impressed by the service or the quality of the sandwiches. I can't remember ever having take out take three hours to arrive. We felt that $33.83 for 2 sandwiches delivered to the house was a bit steep.

2 Stars for delivering until 5 a.m."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and a good cheesesteak. The slices are huge and they have a good selection of slice choices. I ordered the cheesesteak because the bread is flown in from philly and it definitely made the sandwich but they need to put more cheese on it. It's called a \"CHEESEsteak\" not a philly steak!!! But still tasty. The service took forever but they are one of the only places open late night. There's always room for improvement but over all it was a good choice"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and way overpriced. The service was horrible, the employees were rude, and the music was gross and way too loud."}
{"text":"Great place! Great pizza, great atmosphere! It's what you would call a little \"hole in the wall.\""}
{"text":"Slices are larger than large, calzone is off the charts! Anthony is awesome. 

They stay open late- perfect combo? Low Key piano bar, insert SPINELLI'S before or after!!! 
Cheers and God bless America."}
{"text":"My wife and kids loved this place because they love thin crust pizza.  Well this is the \"thinnest\" crust we have ever had...the pizza could use a little bit more toppings on the pepperoni slice and maybe a little bit more cheese.  The mozzarella bites are very tasty, but small.  So we had to order two orders to get our fill on them.

The decor of the place is nice and has a college town feel to it.  We will be back and ordered a pizza to go as well..."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Good pizza and the girls there helped me with my asthma attack. #savedmylifeonadrunknight -thx."}
{"text":"Literally the world's worst pizza. I think it gave me cancer. Tasted like crusty ass cheeks. Thanks Taylor for the recommendation I'm probably going to kill myself after eating such garbage. I wouldn't have this in a prison cafeteria. This pizza was dryer than my DMs...smh. But the service was good."}
{"text":"I went at 2am. The music was really loud, which seems pretty common on mill. The waitresses were helpful at helping you make an economical decision, and overall it seemed like a decent price for a meal on mill. Also got a free dessert for making this review, I will post updates throughout the night.

EDIT: A random person threw a cigarette on our table...one star removed.

EDIT: They actually gave us a pitcher so I don't have to ask for more water every minite and also I just saw a nipple. One star added.

EDIT: DO NOT USE THE UPSTAIRS ADULT UNISEXXX BATHTROOM."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We arrived at 10 pm into Phoenix then by the time we got our car checked into our hotel in Tempe it's well pass 11 pm. Not much was open for food service because most places are bar setting.

Anyway,  Spinelli's gives huge slices of pizza and between my husband, Son and I we all ordered something different to appease us all. 

I had the chicken and waffles pizza which I thought was so good. Especially with a little maple syrup on it. Sweet and savory at the same time. 

My husband had the meat lovers and my son had the barbecue chix pizza. 

We thought it hit the spot and noticed two separate group of girls about 5-6 on each table that came in too and shared a pizza. 

This must be the spot to come.  The front desk at our hotel mentioned a different pizza spot but it was playing really loud music which this place was mixed, restaurant/ bar. 

A Yay to try Spinelli's for that late night appetite."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! I was in town for a few days and I spotted this place because of the character from recess an old kids show and I knew I had to try it. Thankfully I did and it was amazing. You go in seat yourself and get serves huge slices of amazing pizza for an unbeatable price. The deserts are amazing the location was great customer service was great just an overall awesome experience. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Their pizza is good, its probably the only pizza i could eat every single day. There has been a few times i would get old pizza which tasted terrible and i could hardly eat it. But if you do by chance get to eat their pizza when its fresh its great!

Its around $6 a slice, the slices are big but any extra topping besides cheese adds up quickly and it starts to become expensive. For fries, 2 slices and 2 drinks cost me almost $30. For that price and the service its a downer but the craving is what has brought me back as many times as it has.

You pay for ranch if you want it. But dont think your gonna get a full little cup of ranch, they hardly fill it half full. I love their ranch which is the only reason ill spend the money to get it.

If your in a hurry i advise you to seek getting lunch/dinner elsewhere. They told me about 15min for my order of 2 slices. Turns out AN HOUR AND ABOUT 20min for 2 SLICES and this is supposed to be a pick up order and there was NOBODY in the resturant. 

Service is terrible. I dread trying to get a refill because they take your cup and never return or you have to ask someone else where it went. This has happened everytime ive went. They seem to do everything extremely slow and dont really care. Dont expect compensation of any kind if your order is wrong or thats if you ever get your order by the day you order it. The restuarant is not really clean, but i dont expect much from the way it looks."}
{"text":"Was very good.  Had the chicken parm.   The bathrooms though we're so dark I couldn't tell where I was peeing."}
{"text":"We're am I? Philly? 
Maybe, I've never been. but if I were my cheese steak would taste like this. So good.
Pepper, onion ratios were perfect. The steak was great and the cheese wiz was tasty. The bread is brought in from Philly. Soft with a crunchy shell. Nice.
The pizza is also fresh and hand tossed. The big slices are filling.
But Spinelli's is more than that. They have appetizers, salads, desserts, Stromboli and other sandwiches. Bummed, no brew yet but any day now. 
Mac and cheese bites are a good app choice.
Last words... authentic, relaxing and non pretenses. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I came in with a friend around mid-afternoon. There was one group that was just finishing up their meal and they left shortly after we arrived. It took a while to have someone check in on us. We ordered a couple of Long Island Iced Teas, which were very good by the way, and we ordered pizza slices. My friend had pepperoni and I had the hangover pizza. What can In say? Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. I also ordered the cheese fries, because I'm a sucker for cheese fries. The food was delicious, but it took forever to get to us even though we were the only 2 patrons there. The pizza was good, but it wasn't hot. If I had another opportunity, I'd visit the place again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and cheese bites! When entering, we were greeted and the customer service did not stop until leaving! Top notch place to eat!"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery that didn't show up until almost an hour & a half later. around an hour of waiting, I called letting them know how long I had been waiting, the guy who answered said he was about to call me because the girl who took my address down didn't have legible handwriting so he wasn't sure of my address. once he had finally gotten my address, food was here in 15 minutes. other than the wait, staff was very friendly. 

I ordered a Philly cheesesteak sandwich & cheese fries. food is still decent considering it was probably sitting there for a bit. I'll order again but hopefully won't have to wait as long."}
{"text":"very cool hip place to have a bite to eat and in a way relax. Its like eating fresh pizza in your friends livingroom. My hubby and I went for lunch before we went to see a movie and was perfect. Drank a Az ice tea and ate a huge slice of pizza and shared the philly fries ( amazing btw) and watch the 70's show ..lol was very cool."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had! I understand it's just pizza but the people were plain rude. I dealt with 4 different people trying to understand the menu, ordering process, and my order. I finally tried to cancel and they wouldn't let me. Still have not gotten my pizza. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"}
{"text":"Omg I've eaten here whilst hammered so many times... Drunk pizza is amazing but how good does CHICKEN BACON RANCH drunk pizza sound???? This place's pizza is heavenly. They also have Chicken and waffle pizza. Only thing off is that they keep their pizza in an unheated display case that's so dirty you can't see what kind of pizzas are in it. How do they stay fresh? But who cares when you're drunk af after Hefe am I right?!?"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes for our drinks and for someone to take our order. Super disappointed, especially since we were recommended to the place. Not o mention there were only two other people in the place. Super bummed"}
{"text":"Spinelli's is the plug. Pizza is great & don't sleep on the sandwiches either, chicken parm was legit!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a star because the food is great, but the service is by far some of the worst I've ever had, we placed a delivery order and were told that the expected delivery would be two hours later, why does it take two hours to make pizza? So I cancelled it and made a pick up instead, when I got there at the time I was as told it would be ready the bearded skinny guy just yelled from wherever he was walking from asking what I needed, like I was intruding or something, I told him I was picking up an order and he gave it to me, I drove the 5 minutes to my home and my food was cold, not even a little bit warm. When my wife called to ask what the hell happened the beardy man was rude to her, wouldn't tell her his name and kept pushing the blame onto someone else. They will not be getting any more of my money."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Nice bar/pizza place on the corner of downtown. They sell pizza by the slice which drew us inside.

The pieces are HUGE!!! Went around 11pm and the pieces didn't taste too fresh, but they were still good. Hey, at 11pm after bar hopping what doesn't taste good. Brother got the cheese and was pleased. I got the peperoni and was just as happy. The waiter said the pizza wasn't as big as their slices normally are so he discounted it which I thought was nice because the piece was still huge and I didn't finish it.

They only have pepsi products which prevented me from getting a drink. After all, who wants a Jack and Pepsi?"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Monsterous slices with high quality toppings at a good price.

Plus they were playing cuts, everything from the Spinners to Rick Ross.

The order of operations is a little funky as you have to get served by a waitress if you're eating there when they have hot slices all ready to go.

And it was a bit weird not to have red pepper flakes, oregano, and parmesan cheese readily available to sprinkle on the slices."}
{"text":"I'm really giving this place 3.5 out of 5 stars just because the food is good and the owner is from Philly. And Philadelphia is one of my favorite cities. 

Slice of pizza was huge, Philly cheesesteak was delicious, and their macaroni bites were off the chain! 

The only downside to the place was that the service was slow and the server forgot my husband's drink and food order. It also took her a while to check us out. They weren't even really that busy so I don't know what the deal was. She was nice though. Also, when I called late that night to place a delivery order, they told me it would be 2 hours for delivery. 

I would go back though if I was ever in the area just because they're open late and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Tony is Awesome!!!  Pizza is so good!!! And they let my ppl (Natives) hangout w/judgement!!! Good times..."}
{"text":"The food tasted fine but it took a really long time to get even our appetizer. Pizza was better than the philly cheese steak sandwich the meat was kind of chewy and the bathroom wasn't pleasant"}
{"text":"My brother loves coming to Spinelli's with his buddies, so when we had an opportunity to hang out one evening, he wanted to come up to Tempe and dine there. It's just a quick walk from my humble abode in the \"Hipster Compton\" neighborhood. The place fits in well with the downtown vibe, it's very lowkey hipster, similar to Gringo Starr. I find it weird they had no music playing, instead New Girl on Netflix on every TV screen. 

This was right as PokemonGO was going crazy, so they had an Ash & Misty shot special advertised outside. He really just wanted pizza. We ordered a whole pepperoni pizza, and it took awhile [no complaints]. The way my brother described this pizza, you'd think it was the best thing since sliced bread. I wasn't terribly impressed, but I did like the crust and how carbo-licious it is. The slices were almost as big as my face, so we took them to-go. Not sure if that is why the price for an entire pizza is a little high. Probably just worth it in the future to come for a slice."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. Pizza was flavorless and the sauce is way too sweet. It's lacking taste overall. Would not order again here especially for $20 worth. Next time I'll stick with good pizza I know"}
{"text":"The delivery guy got here a little faster than expected and was really nice. The pizza reminded me of cafeteria food from school, it was ehh. The fries tasted like fries, nothing special. Ranch sauce is thick and just didn't taste right. Don't know why they didn't have Pepsi available in the 2 liter size :/ oh well."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars this place is terrible went to get pizza and had the worst service I could get wrong order and neglected for an hour I was told \"we will fix this\" and got pushed aside for an hour.  Not a picky customer coming from a server job my self who ever was the server here told me get my own water at the end of the bar.  Want late night pizza? Go order dominos throw it in the trash, take it out, throw it in the trash again, and eat it...then you might then the same quality as a frozen pizza from the store if you are lucky.  What a joke!"}
{"text":"Got a craving for some pizza late last night and found that this place was open. Ordered a Sicilian for pickup and went down to get it. The guy (I didn't catch his name) working the bar/pizza apologized that it wasn't ready yet since it takes so much longer for the Sicilians to cook. He offered to bring it out to my car since I had to wait and promised it would be worth it. By himself he rates a good rating on this place, he was super friendly and extremely helpful. The pizza was pretty damn big and I put it in my trunk to get it home. When I opened the box, I was not disappointed. 

Each square of pizza was bigger than my hand and two pieces were bigger than a dinner plate. The crust was buttery and chewy and the sauce was pretty good. The cheese could have been a bit heavier but for that size pizza adding more cheese would probably bump the cost a bit. I will definitely be back to try their other pizzas but two pieces of the Sicilian did me in for the night."}
{"text":"This location has been oh-so-many different bars over the years. It's probably best served as a pizza place! The pizza slices are HUGE. They are served on two plates so come prepared to eat! I was also told by the server that even slices are made to order so it's not sitting around all day until you place the order. It took about 10-15 minutes, but I was thoroughly satisfied with the pizza! NOM NOM! So good. I'm from the east coast and love a Philly style slice of pizza, but honestly who doesn't? 

Things that weren't so hot about this place - the bathrooms were pretty gross. I'm not a fan of unisex bathrooms. Keep it separate. There is also a urinal that is covered with a trash bag. If it's covered up, I can only imagine what nastiness is hiding underneath. 

Profanity. They have an open kitchen at one end and we could hear employees conversations and profanity. It's just not very appetizing. 

I did like the cool selection of t-shirts! The walls of artwork/graffiti was also pretty rad. It goes nicely with the Philly theme, but they worked some Sun Devil action into the mural to mix it up!"}
{"text":"Pizza? Good, huge, 1 slice should do you just fine.

Now for the BAD....
Price? Ridiculously expensive and overpriced. I had two random slices of pizza and an iced tea, nothing more. It was $16!!!. I did not custom build my pizzas, I selected two from pies which were premade on the rack. They charged me .75 cents per topping on top of the price for the cheese slice!! I chose a meat lovers, I didn't ask for them to make me a meat lovers, I took what was already baked on the shelf. They charged me for 7 ingredients at 75 cents per ingredient. Needless to say I will never go back there again unless all I want is cheese pizza as I s hold not have to refinance my home to eat."}
{"text":"Oh what a treat!!! Foodie's paradise for pizza. Excellent service and the pizza is awesome. If you like thin crust pizza that is flaky, crunchy and yet it's crust is soft and flavorful then this is your place. Don't forget the ranch. Not needed but it's a house recipe that does not disappoint. I wish there was one in Vegas...well maybe not, I'd gain too much weight because this would become a weekly habit easily. No more of the other guys for me. I'll be holding out til my next visit to Tempe."}
{"text":"YUM is what I have to say about Spinelli's Pizza! I went today for an early dinner, and the pepperoni pizza was to die for. I am not usually a pizza fan in the middle of the day, but Spinelli's definitely changed my mind! 

The service was also awesome. Our server was super nice and helped us pick out a beer. The SanTan Mr. Pineapple was delicious! It was light and refreshing with the pizza! Love this place and will definitely go back! :)"}
{"text":"Not pleasant. I ordered a margherita pizza to go and when i got home to open it- it was unseasoned dough with a ton of sauce and the cheese was in chunks! There was a toral of 6 chunks on my pizza! What kind of pizza s that? I paid nearly 40 dollars (with a tip) for unseasoned dough with 6 small chunks of cheese ???  It was so unappealing that i threw it away. Not very happy about losing all that money over awful pizza! Grocery store pizza in the refrigerator aisle is more tasty!"}
{"text":"Being a former Louisville Ky native, I was excited to see a Spinelli's in Tempe. I even mentioned to our waiter that we were from Louisville and he seemed impressed with our knowledge of the menu. I asked prior to ordering of they had meatballs bec they have always been notorious for running out. The waiter confirmed that they had them so we ordered two white pizza slices add meatballs, a classic favorite of ours. 30 minutes later our waiter comes out with the news that they sold the last of their meatballs on the last to go order. Wtf?!? I asked before I ordered and it took them 30 mins to figure out they didn't have any..... So the waiter took it upon himself to put philly meat on our slices instead of asking us what we wanted. Moments later he brings the under cooked slices that we didn't order to us with the check already totaled up. He never once apologized for the miscommunication and offered no reconciliation either. $15 for two slices that weren't even what we ordered. We won't be back. And all of the kitschy nostalgia we missed from the LouKY locations is not found here, just the poor customer service made the cross country trip."}
{"text":"What can I say, the people here are racist. I came in with a friend and waited for about 8 min. Nobody came to take our order. 4 white guys came in after 5 min and they immediately took their order. We walked out immediately and nobody bothered to notice! Btw, those guys are sitting in a table right besides us. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"So hot in there, staff member making pizza didn't wear gloves (I'm pretty sure that's gross) the bartender was friendly no complaints there! He was uber genuine."}
{"text":"So I ordered from here 3 times to get a good idea of how good they were. They were one of the few places open late and so I decided to try them out despite the prices being a little high. However the menu sounded great so I tried it. After the first time, the food was okay and so I decided to order twice more to get a better idea of the food. I made a mistake. The cheese bread was good. That's about it. I tried the slice of pizza which was so bland and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. The pizza looked awful. Then I decided to try the fired s'mores. Even worse idea. The dough or batter was still raw! I love eating late since I work late and thought this could work but I was wrong. When I asked to at least get a refund or credit to use for another order I was told they don't do that after the first day even though I ordered at 2am. After the disappointing food and customer service I will no longer be eating here. From what it looks like online, the pizza when fresh is great. Mine was far from fresh though, and the fact that they serves me this after spending 30 bucks there after delivery is laughable. Sticking to Zios for my late night pizza."}
{"text":"My favorite late night spot! I mean come on open until 5 am! I'm about to try the chicken and waffles which I am sure won't disappoint! Already have had meat lovers and fried Oreos and they were amazing! Update momentarily!
The chicken and waffle pizza is a must try! I know it's out weird, and I thought so too, but the flavored are so... So umm... Well I'm going back right now for another slice! And my friend's philly steak was amazing! And Mathias service was outstanding his recommendations were great!"}
{"text":"Good pizza! I really liked that you can order your own pizza if you want OR if you are in a hurry they have slices ready so you can order, eat, and go. Pizza was really good and the servers were cool."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD ON MILL

Great environment, great choices, & great customer service. Easily the best food place on mill.  Highly recommend the pizza fries (they know how to do fries right!) or the Buffalo chicken pizza!! 5/5"}
{"text":"First off this is my third time in Phoenix and I've tried many different pizza places but this pizza place is amazing! My delivery came at exactly the delivery time eat 24 said it would the guy that brought it was super cute and very nice the food is amazing this is the biggest damn slice of pizza I've ever had I thought that my order was small but this pizza the pizza fries and this deep fried Smore's is killer. I will definitely frequent this place I think I'm going to have my whole team go out to the restaurant tomorrow, the pizza reminded me of New York pizza even though I think the guys are from Philly nothing beats pizza from Back east  you must eat here!"}
{"text":"Fun place to grab a bite with TV ' S and music blaring thru the restaurant. The decor is skateboard and fun.

Shared a slice of Sicilian Pizza and Philly Cheesesteak Hoagie with deep fried mac and cheese along with deep fried oreos.

I thought the Sicilian Pizza came with toppings but I guess I should have asked. The Philly Cheesesteak was good and hot with plenty of meat. Probably the best thing was the mac and cheese bites and the deep fried oreos.the drinks were in red plastic cups and the food was in paper lined plastic baskets. 

The waitress was awesome she made sure we were taken care of and the owner came by and thanked us for choosing to eat there.

Will come back and try the other food.

Enjoyed the experience"}
{"text":"There are fly's flying everywhere, stay away! My visit was so annoying. Came here with my family for my birthday. We had pizza that was just okay, fly's we're always landing on our table. We had a cake for me too but we did not eat it there, we decided to have cake back home. Horrible and disgusting place."}
