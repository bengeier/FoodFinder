{"text":"I recently visited this cafe and was surprised to find that there were not any toilets, this turned out to be very inconvenient as I had my son with me who needed to use the toilet. We had already ordered some food so we couldn't leave as we didn't want to appear as being rude, I wish I had left though as when the food arrived it wasn't very nice at all, It was dried up and the chips were very greasy. The words that I would describe the food would be most certainly bland which is in the name funny enough. I would strongly advise that if u have young children is not a place to go, and also the staff were very unfriendly also."}
{"text":"Another long established business, this is a functional and basic cafe which always seems to be busy in high season. The decor and overall feel of the place is very basic - like the kind of place you used to visit with your parents back in the days when you had a day trip at the seaside and it was raining. Thats not to say its a bad place though, because it isnt.


 Very much a no frills kind of place - selling teas, coffees, sandiches, snacks, breakfasts, light hot meals and so on, but the quality of what you get is above average, and on the whole provides good value for money.


 Its nothing fancy, its nothing continental, but you'll know that just from the look of the place from the outside, but if you go in expecting a typical english cafe, then you wont be disappointed. Service is fine and friendly, and the hot meals are good - the breakfasts, in particular, are well worth a try and very plentiful."}
{"text":"I went into this cafe with my family & friends in the Easter holiday 2011. My daughter needed the toilet, I was told in a rude manner they did not have to provide a toilet for customers as it is an old building. I was told to go up the street turn left along the road there is a public toilet to use. The food arrived just as I was going to take my daughter to the public toilet. I told them to take the food back as it would be getting cold, my daughter had ordered burger & chips. They then decided they would allow her to use the staff toilet. So I was quite happy to stay & eat the food, as all my daughter needed was the toilet. The food was slammed back down onto the table. I had ordered a ham sandwich, which was not what I would call ham it looked like it was out of a tin & sliced by hand. My friend had ordered poached egg on toast which was under cooked. We left most of the food which was terrible even the children left their burger & chips. I complained about the service & I am still in shock now, the staff where extremely rude. The chef came out with his filthy apron on, in a very abusive manner told us to get out & never come back, & they shoved my 7 year old daughter who was coming out of the cafe last through the door and slammed the door, on the heel of her foot. As we where two women with 3 children we felt extremely intimidated. I would definately strongly advise anybody to never go into this cafe, especially if you have children, as no toilets are provided. The staff are rude & the food was disgusting. 
A very upset family from York."}
