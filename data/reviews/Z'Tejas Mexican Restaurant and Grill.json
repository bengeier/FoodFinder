{"text":"So...I'm not usually one to frequent corporate restaurants....but I can't stay away from those dang frozen margaritas! If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't eat here half as much. I would give the menu 3 stars, but there are two great things on the menu. The chili pork verde and the diablo chicken pasta. Can't go wrong there...and the Tejas trio is great to snack on if you just want a small bite."}
{"text":"Brunch was very disappointing--like a bad expensive Denny's. Bloody Mary bar is outstanding and the building is nice, but the food was expensive and failed miserably to live up to the menu descriptions. It's surrounded by great brunch restaurants that don't disappoint--I won't return for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in over a year, but had to jump on to tell about my recent experience. I feel bad that I don't remember our server's name because he was AWESOME. He made us laugh and was all around attentive, without being annoying. My burger was great, as well, but for me customer service is what's most important so I had a wonderful experience. It's also a great location and a really cool building."}
{"text":"I'm from Austin, Tx, so visiting the Z for brunch or dinner on a weekly basis is a must.  As a Longhorn, my only complaint is John is a Buckeye fan.    This place offers some delicious food and drink.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I usually love Z Tejas. I have been to other locations, and I've always enjoyed myself, had great service, and great food.   First, the parking at this location is a nightmare. Especially during happy hour.  Very crowded, and we had to circle for 10 minutes to find a spot.   Second, our friend looked up this location on the internet before we went to see if they had vegan food options, which it said it did. When we arrived, we discovered that they no longer offered vegan options. So she couldn't eat.  Third, we ordered a table full of appetizers to share. We sat at the table for 30 minutes before we stopped the waitress and asked her to bring cornbread.  Normally they bring that automatically - we were shocked that we had to ask for it. It took another 15 to 20 minutes (for a total of 45 to 50 minutes) to receive our food.  My husband's dish was lukewarm at best and had literally no flavor to it. He had ordered Green Chile Barbacoa enchiladas, and they were terrible.  The rest of the food was just okay. The guacamole that came in my Z Tejas trio had no flavor of any kind.   Our waitress was a bit of a space cadet.  We asked for a glass of water and 10 minutes later had to remind her to bring it. She did take $15 off of our bill to make up for the slow service, but that simply wasn't enough.   We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked in is that the building is very well designed. So for architecture I give Z Tejas a strong grade.   I'll be honest, I wasn't that excited to see this addition to the neighborhood. The Richardson's/Rokerji/Dick's Hideaway people do Southwest food about as well as it can be done and all are within an easy walk of Z. Neighborhood bar? I'll take any number of places including the Garage across the street. I'm just not sure where Z Tejas fits.   The food is exactly what you would expect, pretty good, not great. If you have friends in town from rural Washington/Nebraska/Minnesota, this will be exotic and outside their comfort zone from a flavor standpoint. Arizona people might think a little... Meh. I do like that they section out their menu to show the vegetarian listings, always a positive to make things easier on the diners.   The southwest slaw (I think that's what it's called) was one of the worst things I've ever had. It tastes like somebody took cole slaw and added all the black pepper they could find. I like pepper so I can only assume this was a mistake or designed for a consumer that has almost no sense of taste."}
{"text":"So happy they opened a  Central Phoenix location. We visit 2-3 times a month. We make it a point to go for Lunch when Josh is working the bar. He is amazing!!!! He always remembers us, and makes sure that we are well taken care of.   It does not matter how slow or busy the bar is, he is always right on point.  If you have never been, the dumpling are a must have."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time with my family. I regularly bring in out out of town guests and drop in for happy hour with friends. We are always well taken care of by the staff and the food is on point. I love the shrimp tostada bites, red chile steak salad, and their margaritas rock. I'd pay $10 for the cornbread- it's that good! Highly recommend this place for great southwestern fare!"}
{"text":"The Waitress was amazing and informative. The Jerk chicken salad was fresh and bursting with flavor and I also split the hickory burger with my husband and I could barely eat it because I was so full! Had a refreshing mojito and the complimentary salsa and chips were also fresh, you could taste the roasted peppers. First time here no complaints, only delay there was no one up front when we came in so we stood there wondering what we should do.... uhhh sit down or wait to be seated, eventually someone came and seated us."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!! my wife and I have been there several times. Service is excellent and the food is even better. Like I said we have gone there often and will continue to go. If you  great meal with great service and good pricing this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Service was friendly. food was good. went for lunch, it took them some time to bring it out, but thats fine, makes me feel they are spending some good time making it right  negative: very scant draft beer selection..."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this location. I came here afterwork for dinner and was allowed to choose my seat as the location was not very busy. My waitress was very friendly and answered my questions about different dishes. I ended up getting the fish tacos with a side of veggies. The fish tacos were extremely good and I lovded the mango sauce that came with them."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for mediocre....this is it. My entree was pretty good, but everything else was at best, ok. If I could give 2.5 stars, I would, I'm a generous person. Go to Richardson's, Phoenix grill, otro or dick's hideaway. They are all far superior."}
{"text":"This Z'Tejas location unfortunately hasn't lived up to the expectations I developed after frequenting the Tempe location. The atmosphere feels a little \"Old Country Buffet\" to me (light green and white tablecloths, boring plates) and sadly, the food just isn't anything to write home about.   Most recently, I have ordered the trout dinner and also the chicken burrito on a separate occasion. Both were satisfying but neither one thrilled me, and both were served somewhat sloppily (no garnish, food off center, nothing looked \"pretty\"). I agree with some of the other reviewers who noted that the staff seem to still be getting a hang of the menu and presentation.   The frozen house margarita here is ALWAYS a good choice. You can never fail with one of those suckers! The margarita alone will guarantee my return here - even if I only order appetizers. The tableside guacamole is yummy and the happy hour price ($6 as opposed to almost $11 regularly) is worth it. I have always loved the cornbread and the salsa/dip trio on the appetizer menu.   In summary: go for the margarita and the appetizers! I'd like to try dinner service again in a few months when they've had more time to perfect it."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Thank you to Hemi and the chef for the special habenaro salsa for the turkey wrap, delish. Very consistent any time of day."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Saturday, Jan 14. What used to be exciting, interesting food has become dated. The restaurant had so many empty tables, it was surprising.  Service was slow and somewhat inattentive.  When the entrees arrived rice was not fresh and was cold on the plate, as were the black beans.  I complained about this and the manager did correct the problem. However, the rice and beans originally served should have never been on the plate... If shows someone in the kitchen doesn't give a damn what is going out, and this may be an indication as to why there are so many empty tables on a Saturday night at 7 pm.  The entree was tasty, I just think the concept has lived it's time.  One last note, bring your flashlight so you can see where you're going as you leave the restaurant. The walkway area is incredibly dark and there are several step downs as you exit the north side of the walkway. Difficult to see."}
{"text":"Great spot for Happy Hour. Skip the mediocre entrees and just sit at the nice bar and enjoy an appetizer and a drink.  Happy Hour is until 7pm Mon-Fri and it gets busy. If you're lucky, snag a seat at the bar and order up a Chambord Margarita and some Guacamole and chips."}
{"text":"I wouldn't return here if I had a choice. The only menu item enjoyed was the catfish beignets. Moving on..."}
{"text":"Frustrating experience for our party of 12.  Seems the left hand was not talking to the right hand.  Bar orders were slow, 6 of the 12 people in our party returned their meals because they were cold, others were lukewarm. They ran out of salsa, had to make more, so we did not have any for our meals and it was only 7:00pm.    Empty plates littered the table as the server staff walked right by and only picked them up when we ask.  Manager stepped in, told up about the new management and offered some free desserts.  Would not go back to the 16th/Bethany Home location.  Missed the dumplings."}
{"text":"It was a lunch time, and I was starving. Z'tejas seemed to be the only quick option around, so we parked our car and got a table.   The overall design of the place was not bad. The service was not bad (fake). Now the food... The food was bad-from the presentation, to the consumption part, was just bad.   I had the Pork \"tender\"loin The meat looked like it had been sitting in the Atlantic for a few years. The onions rings were the best thing in the plate, and I use the word \"best\" very loosely  My mother had the mahi... She compared it to, \"A dried out version of what could've been\"   Z'tejas need to stop trying to do 20 things and focus on one type of food.                               -Heisenberg"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this location. First impression of the design and decoration was amazing. We sat next to a wide open accordion window so we could enjoy the wonderful weather and open air. I ordered the BBQ burger and it was honestly one of the best burgers I gave Ever had. The BBQ sauce mixed with the pickles, bacon, and jalapeño sauce was great. I had a great time and the staff was very attentive and nice. I will go back."}
{"text":"We have been to the Tatum and Shea location many times and had high expectations. This place did not impress us. We had been on Mother's Day and the place was packed. The staff was friendly but the kitchen didn't seem to be able to cope with the crowd. It was an hour 'till we got our food and then it wasn't hot. We thought we would give it another try so made a reservation for 6 pm. on Friday night. At 6:45 , after not a word from the hostess, we gave up and walked over to PCG and had a great evening.  I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I hesitated to give this review because I'm all for supporting neighborhood businesses, but it was time. By nudging of friends, been coming on and off for years and my experience has almost always been the same-average service and average food. Although, the shrimp tostadas are tasty. Drinks are way overpriced. This place has never wowed me nor have I left with that overwhelming feeling of delight. All I remember is spending a lot of money for a \"meh\" time."}
{"text":"I got the mushroom enchilada and it was so good. It had black beans, corn, cheese, a mango salsa that was super tasty. The creamy sauce was super savory and more on the sweet side. It was a good sweet though. I definitely recommend it. The service was phenomenal. We always had our drinks refilled and were always helped out when needed."}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you..... Um........for proving my point.   Fusion places are a bad idea.... Add the fact that its a chain to that and wow = disaster.....  We had a party of thirteen. Great service, considering the size of the table, the server was awesome... Meaning nice, and attentive.  The food however, and I use the term \"food\" loosely, was horrible. Why do they feel the need to mix, Mexican, southwest, southern, and Chinese!!   Really what is that?  Can't you just do one thing amazing and not twenty things just mediocre?  Anyways...13 people and not a one finished their meal. Not a one had the same thing, not a one, took anything to go, and not a one liked what they ordered..... Ehhhhh   Food is just weird, prepared weird, looks weird and tastes like an expensive chili's  Okay, okay.... I am done. Sad but true, such a waste of an amazing local community location...... :-(   P.s. don't ever tell someone from the south that you serve the best cornbread in the country........well, unless its actually true. Okay thanks."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas has been around forever, even before I started cooking 15 years ago. I remember being a punk high school kid and going to Scottsdale Fashion Square and actually smoking on their \"patio\" that was actually inside the mall.  At that point in my life I had two favorite meals... the Tuscan Lemon Chicken from Hoolihans, and the Diablo Chicken Pasta from Z'Tejas.  Sorry for being all introspective, but nearly ever time I try something from my childhood that I haven't had for a long time I end up disappointed. So here is my dilemma, is the quality gone south, or my taste buds \"north\"?  Ug... I dunno, but this dish was a huge let down. I remember the cotija cheese having a nice pop and the pasta being cooked perfectly. This time the cheese was scant and the pasta was a mushy blob.  My wife says I should know better. I used to think my mom's linguini was sent down by angels, now Ia make a Fettuccini Alfredo that Mario Battali would eat off of the floor if i dropped it.  Its me I guess. Sometimes I wish I was a kid again.  If you still love Olive Garden or can't wait to go back to Applebee's you will love this place. If you've moved on from your high school crushes and refined your taste buds, you may just want to head in for one of their superb margaritas and eat at one of the other fabulous restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very rude would not serve a group of 20 poeple because the host did not want to move tables together and sit us."}
{"text":"Now they've raised the price (again) of the formerly free cornbread. Officially done with them now."}
{"text":"I must say, I was very disappointed with yesterday's lunch at Z Tejas. The food was delivered cold, even though it was served in a skillet. My dining companion specifically said no cheese on her salad- it came loaded with cheese. To boot, the cheeses were glumped together; definitely not freshly grated cheese. Not a place I will try again soon."}
{"text":"I had been to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location several times before but I recently went to this location for my first time. First off the ambience is very different! It was much more formal in the dining hall and had a bar area that was packed. There was tons of people laughing and chatting and the it was overall very loud (Not a bad thing at all seemed like they were having fun!) But we decided to seat in the dining area due to the noise which was much more quiet.  Our server was very friendly and personable. She gave us several very honest menu suggestions instead of the regular sales pitch you may get from a server. I ordered a blood orange margarita then later on a cucumber jalapeno margarita. Both were what I had expected and she tipped me off that they have Tequila Tuesday's and all tequila drinks are half off! Cheaper than happy hour!  I also ordered the ruby trout which was amazing! It was so soft and juicy and was topped with the most amazing mango salsa. My S.O. ordered the steak which although it was more pink than he requested, it was great nonetheless.   We had quality service, lovely ambiance, and great food. I can't wait for winter when they open up the dining hall to become a huge patio. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This review is for Margaritas only - by far some of the best I've ever tasted!  The food on the other hand ... go someplace else for that unless you're only gong for drinks and bar eats. Dinner .... I'll totally pass on!  I, along with the 3 ppl I bought here enjoyed the appetizers wayyyyyyyyyyy more than the entrees!"}
{"text":"Bad Service ! Went there for Lunch and it took 45 mins to get our food! Cornbread wasn't cooked and the tortilla soup was just cheese."}
{"text":"Seriously how cheap can you be? No more complimentary corn bread??? $3.00? Towards charity... THIS MONTH? And then 50% to charity and 50% to Z'Tejas next month and then all to Z'Tejas when?? Very wise marketing for a $1.50!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Been here a few times since I've came to Arizona. Moved nearby so I'll be going more often. Happy hour is awesome. Wish they kept the patron frusions (sp* lol) on the happy hour. But they're food is great every time I go. I'm suppose to go this weekend!"}
{"text":"This place is great, everything about it. Last night my waitress was scarce but another was on top of my drinks. Go figure. But the street tacos are a definite order every time...just delicious. Great happy hour menu and the reverse happy hour make for a terrific late night snack."}
{"text":"We really like this place. Nice attentive service. I had questions about the gluten-free items on the menu and they were able to help competently. The food was amazing and exactly what we expected. We will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Overall, my boyfriend & I love coming to this location...  If we get Brian as our server, it's always great! (He's the best! )  - otherwise it can be a little 'hit or miss' with the service, especially if its really busy!   The food is usually pretty good & the frozen margaritas are awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love Ztejas, I frequent the South Coast location a lot and decided to stop by while visiting family in AZ. I drove from the west side of town and was happy I didn't have to make the journey to Mill Ave or deal with Scottsdale Fashion square. The location is very open and quant. The middle of the dinning area has a glass ceiling and looked like it would be very nice for an event of some sort. The location also has sliding windows which is a nice concept until the family behind us asked to open them. I'm sure today was an average of 90 degrees so I had to suffer waves of hot air blowing at me. Luckily, we were getting ready to leave everyone their seemed very friendly and lie waitress was so enjoyable and very friendly. Our food came out fast and the difference I noticed from this location to the South Coast was the fact that they serve big portions. I always get the Mushroom enchiladas, they come with beans rice and mango salsa which goes perfect with the enchilada sauce. I couldn't even finish half and I was full. They offer happy hour, hours vary and it's totally worth it!!  They need to make more locations in North OC!!!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Love coming to this place for their happy hour specials.  Their food is gourmet, always has tons of flavor.  AMAZING AMAZING, AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Excellent grilled trout with mango salsa. Steak burrito rocks! Superb table service, attentive and informative. Very clean inside and out. I like that there are seating choices either the \"library\" a quieter area, or the \"man cave\" in the bar area, the \"green room\" like an atrium with plenty of light, or the actual bar area. Something for everyone. Looks like happy hour menu is diverse. On Monday's and Tuesday's it's 1/2 off a bottle of wine. Prices are reasonable and service was excellent. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a \"Z's\" in years, but this was a good experience. The service was fast, the staff friendly, and the food was good. I had one of their signature salads and didn't leave hungry. The Cornbread is fantastic!! I can make a meal out of that alone!!"}
{"text":"I thought the service was great and enjoyed the ambiance with the glass ceiling in the center of the restaurant. The food wasn't spectacular, but definitely consistent with what I expect from a ztejas. I had catfish beignets with fries which were peppery and great with the spicy tartar sauce. My husband had Barbacoa enchiladas which tasted fine as well."}
{"text":"Amazing. We came here for a birthday lunch. Spinach salad was the best. Highly recommend. Wild mushroom enchiladas were excellent. Our Server Paul was attentive, funny, and made our experience a memorable one. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a party of 9 or 10 last week will attending a nearby conference. A few of our diners have been coming to this place for many years due to its location near the conference, and they raved about the crispy salmon.  When we arrived, the restaurant wasn't too busy, and they seated us at a large table after we grabbed our drinks from the bar.  We quickly found out that the crispy salmon was no longer part of the menu; a big disappointment for the regulars in our group. It's funny, because even as I write this review, their online menu shows the dish.  Our waitress was very nice, and apologetic. Without our knowing, she mentioned our disappointment to the manager, who made it a point to come by the table and explain that they had recently (within the last few weeks) we under new management, and the menu changed as a result. He was nice & polite and asked if there was anything he could do. A few minutes later, the waitress brought out two complementary Chili con Queso appetizers for the table to share. A nice touch, which we all appreciated.  Anyway, the meal was OK. I don't even recall what I had; fish of some sort but nothing overly memorable. Don't know if I would come back on my own.  I will say that our waitress was great! Patient and well tempered and even was kind enough to write up separate checks for everyone at the end of the meal; something many restaurants frown on with large parties, especially if not requested at time of ordering."}
{"text":"I don't care what day or what meal, the food is always great. All locations have their own unique vibe, but food is always good. Service too. You will always find a smile and great service from start to finish. Love the place and will keep coming.  Margaritas are super dangerous and damn good. Try them all.....you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Z Tejas ever. First, there is no parking. Then Ivey was a horrible server, non-attentive, didn't bring more drinks as we sat with empty glasses for 20 minutes. Then food was mediocre at best, they over-cooked my $26 steak, then took so long to bring a new one that I had to eat alone as the rest of the table had already finished. To top it off, in the middle of dinner, there are blinds in the ceiling that they opened while food was on the table and watched the dust fall into food. Completely unacceptable and would not recommend this Z Tejas location to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food however service was not very good. The manager (Steve) came over and rectified the situation beautifully. The cowboy meatloaf and pecan crusted chicken salad were amazing and so is the cornbread. I will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour drinks...chamboard margarita is amazing. I like how happy hour runs from 3-7 m-f and 3-5 on weekends. However, happy hour appetizers are over priced and I just don't see the value. I find the guacamole in the Tejas trio is of lower quality than if you order table side guacamole. Very clean, great ambiance, and great service."}
{"text":"Food was good however service was super slow. I wasn't going to write a review but the service was so slow I decided to post a review.  Management needs to check on service."}
{"text":"Nothing to really write home about. Upscale chain Tex-Mex. Sorta overpriced for what you get, but that's just my opinion considering I have been so accustomed to far cheaper, better food. Nice place to take your white friends/parents who are afraid of going too native."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in for a bit Monday evening.  Place was not super crowded, but busy.  Service was horrendous.  We sat there unaknowledged (is that even a word) with no one saying hi, offering a water, or anything for like 5 minutes.  That being the case, we took our business elsewhere.  Not very impressed at all.  Head over to Richardsons if you want great service and good mexican food.  We won't be going back unless we get desperate for variety."}
{"text":"Showed up with a group of people after kickball and hostess was very short and un-accommodating. After waiting at a dirty table and no service, we left."}
{"text":"Great building, cool place to hang out. But if you are looking for tasty and unique food, you can do much better at many of the other restaurants in the area. They are still trying to get there service techniques down, so it was noticeably chaotic. Also, happy hour specials are nothing to write home about.   I've been to other Z Tejas's in the valley and found this one to have not as good service and definitely not as good food.   Regardless it is one of the more unique settings to hang out with big open windows and a glass ceiling."}
{"text":"I went there last Sunday early afternoon on a date, never been, I live a 6 minute walk away. Nice decor inside- my friend had a burrito and I had a breakfast skillet of veggies and eggs. I thought that there was supposed to be some sort of protein included but found none, and I wanted my eggs scrambled but they came over easy. But what was really disappointing were the veggies. They were obviously cooked in oil because they were SO WET AND OILY that I was shocked that the chef would let something like that to be served in his dinning room. No I did not complain, the last meal I had was at 2:00 pm the day before and I was starved. As I slurped down the greasy meal I reminded myself that there are about 10 places to eat within walking distance of my home and I raelly needed to eat SOMETHING at that moment. I normally stay away from chains and now will continue to do so. Good day to all-"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place! Everything we had was delicious, from the tejas trio (salsa, guac & queso), to margaritas.   We had the barbacoa enchiladas and the diablo pasta and added shrimp. I couldn't stop eating my pasta!   They also give every table home made skillet cornbread with what seemed to be fresh butter. Completely obsessed with that.   I wish we lived here do we could enjoy this place more often!"}
{"text":"Well my first visit here wasn't great. Food didn't get ordered, got double charged, and there was a hair on the plate. Yikes. This all was taken care of by our waiter who was very nice. I came back a second time and it was better. Got the Hickory Burger. YUMMY! and the quesadilla was fantastic."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Z'Tejas in years and only recently realized they'd opened a location in central Phoenix.  Came here with my Dad for dinner.  The weather was perfect outside so they actually opened up the big windows in the dining area which gave it a great open air feel.  The waitress was very friendly and was attentive throughout the evening.  We started off with the cornbread.  Not the best I've had but very flaky and buttery.  For the dinner, I got the chicken mac and cheese.  The chicken had a little kick but wasn't as spicy as I expected.  The mac and cheese was excellent and the breadcrumbs complimented the dish nicely.  Simple, stick to your ribs goodness.  The mac and cheese dish was a little pricey at $15, but it was a pretty good portion of food that filled me up no problem.  Will be interested to try out the rest of the menu at some point.  Food was decent and the building is a nice addition to what used to be an all but dead corner of 16th and Bethany.  Seems like most of the previous reviews appear to mirror my experience (though I didn't hate my food as much as some apparently did).  But for what its worth, I was satisfied with my first visit here."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let people know that I had a great dining experience last night. My server was on point. I believe his name was patrick. I never had to ask for anything, my drinks were always full my dinner was great. Thank you z Tejas for having such an awesome staff."}
{"text":"We have not eaten at a Z'Tejas in many years. We were very pleased with the decor, service,food and prices. Dining on a Friday evening we expected to have to wait to be seated, but were seated immediately. The food was excellent. I have food allergies, the server was very helpful. Dinner for two without drinks was less than $34.00."}
{"text":"Wow!! Z Tejas is definitely one of my top to go restaurants. Excellent customer service displayed by Jeremy,Nate,and James .Their smiles are contagious and their warm and friendly hello just makes me want to keep coming back .5 STARS TO THOSE GUYS IN CHARGE ! Next on the agenda is recognizing some really awesome bartenders that surround themselves with an impressive selection of margaritas .Josh behind the bar has a unique talent when it comes to making me feel welcomed and comfortable .The best margarita in the world is set right in front of me and always a memorable experience takes place when \"Josh is in the house !\" Taylor also rocks a good gig when i sit down for a \"rita\".She always anticipates the guests needs and truely is a hospitable person .I have witnessed both bartenders always project a sense of calm even when the bar is full ..they give a Z positive vibe !!!!!!  5 STARS to Josh and Taylor !!!!"}
{"text":"Consistent service and food always full of flavor.  Right around the corner for us, so love the location with plenty of parking.  Affordably priced with brunch menu for $8-$13 that comes with fruit and a small muffin."}
{"text":"This place is crazy expensive for mediocre food! They have good drinks, cornbread and tortilla soup. That's it. My group of friends and I did not like our entrees. Chicken was overcooked and they smothered our pasta with this bland gravy-like sauce. Will not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"For those that don't already know, what was once Z Tejas fell into bankruptcy some months ago. What has emerged is a poor xerox copy of what Z used to be. Z Tejas USED to be the restaurant by whose burger (the Z Burger) I would measure all others, sadly, this is no more.  My wife and I stopped in last week and was greeted by a hostess with the mostest, rocking oddly patterned leggings/tights paired with a faux fur lined vest meant to be worn outdoors or not at all. First impression, not good. I know, I know, it's about the food, not the environment nor the fashion faux pas of the staff, but sadly, this is what greets you upon entering an eating establishment that's supposed to be more upper class.  Our waiter, while nice, didn't seem to be bothered to write down my order. I'm sure had he done so, my burger would have come as ordered, without bacon. Of course, I don't actually remember the Z Burger ever having bacon as a default, but apparently it does now. ATTENTION Z TEJAS: NOT EVERYBODY LOVES BACON. And those of us that don't appreciate bacon on our burgers should be able to opt out. Instead, and despite my request to pass on the bacon, what do my eyes behold, but two lovely meat strips serving as a meaty condiment to my already meaty burger. \"Well, couldn't you simply take off the bacon?\" you might ask. I tried, but the geniuses that are the bacon lobby have insisted that the bacon be put under the cheese. So, removing the bacon would also remove the vast majority of the cheese. But I digress. Up until this woefully inadequate experience I would judge every burger out there by the Z Burger, but that is at an end. I'm not sure what changes the new ownership has made, but they're all poor choices. The burger, while cooked properly (surprise) was bland. Lifeless. Tasteless. It was a burger that made me think, what was the point of killing the cow to make such a poor excuse for a burger. Then you put on the bacon and you have a most disappointing experience. One that shall not be repeated.  On another note, for those of you that know, Z Tejas USED to give out free cornbread. A small cast iron skillet filled with fluffy gold. The corn bread was almost by itself a reason to go to the restaurant. That tradition has also been scuttled. Now they charge $3 for each skillet of cornbread, not a terribly big deal, but it is when you consider that something has changed about the cornbread. It's not the sweet salty experience that it once was. It too has become almost bland and without a point to its existence.  The only redeeming fact that came from this visit is that my wife enjoyed thoroughly her steak burrito. And perhaps she'll return someday to enjoy it again. Though she'll skip the cornbread and I'll not be joining her.  Alas Z Tejas, I knew thee well."}
{"text":"Always friendly , fast service. This is Z place to go! Thanks for being consistant in delicous food and friendly service."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks great and our waitress was super.  We order some appetizers, including the made at the table guacamole.  We were told how the pumpkin seeds really set off the dip.  Wrong.  There wasn't any sort of seasoning that we could taste and the seeds were distraction and were NOT visibly appealing.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great by any means.  The salsas you offer were offensively bad however.  My friend commented the house salsa reminded him of the stuff they served in the junior high cafeteria.  When I tasted it I had to agree.  Then we tried the avocado based salsa.  It was suspended in gelatinous mass that reminded me of mucus.  So not good I had one taste and had the waitress remove it from the table.  The remaining salsa wasn't bad, but was so watery and runny you couldn't keep it on a chip.  To have a name like Z'tejas and not have a salsa that is even passable should be embarrassing for you all.  The cornbread looked great and who doesn't like free cornbread?  Um, that would be us... After we tasted it.  Bad texture and devoid of good flavor.  Throw some green chilis in there and lose the honey butter.  Honey butter doesn't lend itself to cornbread.  Fry bread yes, cornbread no.  My friend had the famous tortilla soup.  It suffered the same mucus condition afflicting the avocado salsa.  I can't remember ever just looking at a soup and finding it unappetizing... Not so looking at his bowl of greasy goo covered in cheese.  Seriously?  Have you even had tortilla soup?    My buddy had the mushroom enchilada.  Everything about the plate made it look unappetizing as it was drenched in flavor-lacking sauce and devoid of any \"zip\" or \"zing.\"  He ate half and gave up. My entre had been recommended by another server--the steak burrito.  I ate 2/3 of it before I realized I was eating to finish, not because I was enjoying it.  The whole time I kept waiting to be impressed, or even satisfied.  I threw in the towel.  We momentarily considered dessert but given the lackluster performance thus far we both knew it would just be more let down.  Each of us, at some point during the meal announced \"I'd never come back here for this.\"  On the way out we said in unison, as we eyed Zipps across the parking lot... \"We should have gone there to eat!\"  There was not one memorable dish.  Not even a memorable flavor.  The meal just sucked!  Our server was great and seemed apologetic as she saw the unfinished plates.  I have to imagine she sees that a lot.  I cannot fathom they have many repeat customers.  Within a stone's throw you have four restaurants that produce meals far better than anything I saw you offer at similar prices.  The Rokerij, Richardson's, Phoenix City Grille and even The Vig.    Their first priority should be getting a decent salsa.  Next would be actually trying the food they are putting out and then seeking to make it taste like something good.    I'm hugely disappointed with the quality of their food.  I give décor and service big thumbs up.  But I won't return for just those two things, there has to be good food too.   PS: I'm shocked to see the rave reviews of the food.  I can only assume such reviewers spend a lot of time eating at Denny's.  Filiberto's serves up far better tasting food for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"I participate in a group that meets here weekly and the service and food have been outstanding EVERY TIME. The staff are always friendly and greet everyone with a smile, and they seem to go out of their way to make the experience of dining there special.  The food is always great!  My personal favorites are the Green Chile Pork Stew and the Mango Chile Steak Salad. The margaritas are great (even the Skinny). I highly recommend their happy hour - margs are $5 and the Green Chile Stew is $6, and of course there's always plenty of fresh, hot cornbread and butter!"}
{"text":"Had the breakfast enchiladas, very nice flavor with the red chili sauce and chicken. I subbed in the pan fried breakfast potatoes for the Black beans and yet I still got black beans. Ugh. So I flagged down one of the staff and told them and they promptly corrected the problem, or so I thought. The potatoes arrived ice cold!  So this time the server corrected the problem, or so I thought. She opted to bring me a soup cup of flaming hot potatoes because the cook decided to deep fry them!  I didn't feel like arguing anymore so I finished the enchiladas and called it a day. I don't like shortcuts and feel like they think they fooled me. You won't get the chance to fool me twice!"}
{"text":"We were in last week for a birthday party in the bar area. Unfortunately, I had a pretty hefty sized lunch so I wasn't very hungry when I came in. I ordered the tortilla soup and it was fantastic, one of the ladies at our table thought it was a bit spicy, however, I didn't taste the spice at all. It had a wonderful flavor and the avocado was a great addition to the soup.   They really made this new location look great. I loved the windows all the way around the restaurant until someone decided they needed to open them. It wasn't warm out, the temps were only in the 60's and it was windy so as soon as the windows opened everyone's napkins started flying around. Most folks appeared to be cold, when people start putting on sweaters/jackets while you're opening the windows, it might be a sign the windows don't need to be open.   Because of this, I wouldn't be back unless it was warm out for fear of freezing to death."}
{"text":"I live in the area so I stop in or pick up once a month. I have had a good experience each time. I did recently call in an order for pick up and after returning home realized that I didn't get half of my order. I called the next day and they totally made it right. I will continue to patron this establishment for this reason alone. There is something for everyone on this menu as well! The Bloody Mary bar is awesome on weekends!"}
{"text":"I am giving the 4 stars for space: fabulous bar area with lots of windows.  I would give 3 stars or less for food. But it is to be expected at ztejas I suppose. Maybe the rating could be higher if they did something about their rice."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I always come here for happy hour and sit in the bar area. We absolutely love the margaritas, appetizers, and my personal favorite - the nachos! They have a great happy hour and an awesome bar staff. We love Chris L., Elena, and Paul! They always make sure that we are more than satisfied with the food, drinks, and customer service. They're so friendly and great to be around, which is nice since not many places have great staff to be around. We come probably once a week and have never been disappointed - I highly recommend for a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a New Mexican cuisine look no more! This place is amazing! Had brunch this Sunday and paul, Chris, and Elena  delivered top notch service! The pork verde with eggs was great and if you like jalapeño bacon you will not be let down. If you don't know now you do, they have the best margaritas in town!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the bartender's service was not. I sat at the bar and from the beginning the bartender was unfriendly and more occupied with herself than the customer. Most of the time she was either texting or gossiping with the server. The barback was being more attentive than her! This place has potential but the bartender ruined it for me. I don't think ill go back."}
{"text":"Had the best Taco Tuesday at Z'Tejas! They had awesome live music that we stayed extra long to listen to - SO fun, the guys were awesome.  We got tequila sodas, half off for Tequila Tuesday. Extra lime, tasty! Our waitress was so on it, even with a pretty big crowd earlier in the evening. I ordered the shrimp tostadas app, and she had heard me mention I was trying to stick to low-carb foods so offered to bring out cucumber with the plate instead of tostada. SO helpful and forward thinking!   Had a blast and will definitely be back, especially on live music nights."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Nice ambiance.  But 5.50 for a beer?  Come on.  That's just ridiculous.  Won't be back.  It's not about money....it's about Principle, baby!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy and appreciate this Z Tejas. Definitely doesn't feel like your typical run-of-the-mill chain restaurant establishment. Every staff member is friendly and gracious. Even when it's busy, the atmosphere never gets crazy loud. The restaurant is always neat and clean both in the bar and dining areas as well as the bathrooms. Food is consistently delicious. Prices are reasonable, especially during happy hour. Check out the bloody mary bar during Sunday brunch. Also, be sure to try to fish taco appetizer--healthy, fresh, and tasty!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for my first time today. I had heard a lot about it and wanted to try it. The door was opened and I was greeted by the hostess and immediately seated which was great. I had John as my server and he was attentive and polite. He recommended the street tacos which I ended up ordering. I think it was 4 smaller tacos with steak and avocado. They were fabulous, would absolutely order again. I even met the General Manager, Rich, who happened to be walking around to tables asking if everything was okay. Overall I was very pleased. Also, very cool that they are donating corn bread proceeds to a kids charity! That was awesome."}
{"text":"Met a friend for reverse happy hour on a Friday night.  I ordered the skinny cucumber mule and the street tacos.  The mule was refreshing. And for only $5, you can't go wrong.  It's a smaller mule than what I am used to, but that's okay.  The street tacos were good too.  It four small steak tacos with avocado, cheese and some sort of pink sauce on top.  And of course you get that delicious corn bread.  Reverse happy hour starts at 9pm."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it has never failed to disappoint.  The margaritas are pretty good but not the best I have had.  Their bloody mary's are average even though there is a website that says it is one of the best bloody mary's in town.  The chicken tortilla soup is outstanding! I do not normally like soup from restaurants, but this one is the best I have ever had.  I have had a few entrees but none of them very memorable.  The only reason why I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is because every time I order the soup to go, it is usually pure broth.  When I eat in the restaurant, however, it is a full meal with plenty of chicken.  I do not think it is fair to pay and tip for a to go order for about $10 when I end up just paying for broth.  Great place overall, though."}
{"text":"Opening Day and it was tasty and fun. Love the open windows and skylight dining area"}
{"text":"This place seems very nice.  Appetizers were great (chicken quesadilla).  Tortilla soup was delicious and fresh as well.  Chicken salad is amazing!!  Fresh air coming through to our table.  Couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"I always forget this location was here. So close to my home, finally made it into Z'tejas last night for happy hour. The service was great the food was delish. I love the shrimp tostito bites and they had live music! My fav!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and there always seems to be that little bit of hospitality or smile missing. Three star is bad or good. It just is right. That's how each time here feels. I love the ambiance and the food is generally good. Went with street tacos and the habanero pasta. I loved the pasta. Chicken was cooked right on. Took some Togo. It could've been just service really. It was fine enough. Greet, order, drink refill and check. No mistakes. But it felt awkward, no smiles, no conversation. This place isn't off our list but I doubt it'll be a top priority to get back."}
{"text":"First of all, the ambiance can be the sole reason why anyone should visit.  The food was tasty all around and our server was both helpful and thoughtful.  It wasn't packed for a Thursday evening.  We made it there an hour before HH ended and we were quite happy with our margaritas.  Surprisingly, I didn't break into a sweat trying to find parking.  It was a real chill night.  So, go there!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Seated right away, the staff was very friendly. She brought the cornbread with mouth watering honey butter that just melted in your mouth. I had the steak salad AMAZING!  My mom had the chicken quesadilla appetizer it was happy hour, but she couldn't finish it. It's a meal.  Wonderful place my mom can't wait to go back. Me too."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We came here for a work lunch and I walked out full, buzzed, and happy.   Order the cornbread. Order the trio. Hell, order anything you want. ALL of it is good.  Crazy note:  There's a margarita called the \"Shemango\" that is AMAZING. They only allow you to order a maximum of three because of how strong the drink is. I finished the first one and felt like I drank five. SUCCESS!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my review a couple or so years ago when the restaurant was sold and it came out of bankruptcy.  Went there the other day with the fam cause I had a gift certificate.  My granddaughter had the burger and fries from the kids' menu.   I had the CHILE PORK VERDE, which comes with a side of three flour tortillas.   I can't remember what my son had.   Ordered the cornbread -- of course.  Yummm!   Still love the cornbread.   It comes out warm.  Give it a swipe of butter/margarine, and it's the best.   My chile verde was good.    Not great but good.   I think I would like it spicier, but that's me.   Perhaps I should have asked for chili flakes or something.   It comes with plenty of pork and the green chili.  I had some of my granddaughter's fries and burger.   Yummm on the fries.   I like how they're seasoned.   Even after taking them home and eating them cold, they were still tasty.   Not the usual bland and boring cold fries.   And the burger was seasoned as well.   I'm not a big burger fan, but it was tasty.   It came with the obligatory lettuce and tomato, and the burger was topped with green chili.  I hadn't been there for a long time, but I think I'll go back."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this review. We started out happy hour here which was awesome-one of the best in The Valley in my opinion. Their happy hour is FANTASTIC. Shrimp tostadas, queso fundido, catfish beignets, all $6-$8 and all amazing.  I'm not much of a margarita or tequila guy (BAD experience in high school with a big jug or market-brand tequila-took me years before I could drink tequila again) but their frozen margaritas KICK ASS. In fact, they kicked MY ass. I had either 2 and a half or three and a half-I can't remember but I was DONE after that. SHIT!!!!!  So good food, good drinks, what could go wrong? Well we had an amazing server called Nicole who was FANTASTIC. She took great care of us and really was an all-around exceptional server. When she told us she was finishing her shift, we closed out with her to make it easier for whoever stepped in for her. And THAT is where the problem was. We were not looked after once Nicole finished. We had to ask three different employees several times for more drinks. No one seemed to know (or care) who was our server, so that was a very disappointing end to an otherwise great experience. So four stars for the first part of the visit, two stars for the latter part. Nicole makes up the additional star.  Lacking service notwithstanding, how could you not come in for such great HH specials?"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa?   The salsa is bland and has absolutely no favors. The chips are not one of my favorites as anyone else tonight. They have not other salsa. The street tacos, had a lot of goo flavor and the green salsa served with them is really good.  They out to serve green withe chips. Margaritas with chambor were good as usual. Beer was very cold as we like it. Oh and by way...to the ne owners.... Put the shrimp dumplings back on the menu.  Those were the best  appetizer on the menu.  I can only give you guys 2 stars. Still love the atmosphere here. Peace!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience for dinner. Pasta was over cooked and when the server was informed, there was no offer to return the food and make it right. The server removed the plates without asking if I was finished. When I  informed him I wasn't finished,  he tried to recover and bring the plate back which is also a nono The manager did not come talk with us regarding the poorly cooked food. When leaving the hostess asked how everything was and I told her my concerns, again no offer for a manager to discuss the poorly cooked food. With so many other food choices, I will not go back."}
{"text":"Awesome free cornbread & hickory burger with jalapeño aioli is one of the best burgers I have eaten."}
{"text":"We are from Boston where tex mex is rarely good. Great good, good happy hour deals and above average service made our night a good one."}
{"text":"You will NEVER be disappointed here. If you are, you are not human. This is our neighborhood go-to on a clutch- and we clutch at least once a week... Seriously best Z around - atmosphere is amazing with open air bar , lots of light and such an upbeat atmosphere! (Guitar playing in the background is AWESOME BTW. You have to pay attention to him-  he is playing much more than guitar, holy cow!!) we love, and I mean LOVE shrimp tostada bites, cornbread, pot stickers, ahi tuna and of course our waitress NICOLE!!! (Best ever. For real - and it's not the chambord  marg talking!) PS- gotta try at least one chambord marg, our only drink of choice here!"}
{"text":"Went here based on some great reviews on Yelp and we were absolutely glad we did!! The staff were absolutely professional and genuinely friendly, the food was amazing, and the overall feel of the place was great! Not to mention, there was a live one-man band/singer playing known as \"Shepherds and Sailors\" and it made it even better! This dude could sing and play guitar better than many other live acts I've seen...what an impressive guy! We got the hickory burger, steak street tacos, and chicken street tacos and it was all unbelievably delicious! Don't forget to order the green chli queso and chips...we couldn't get enough of it and it was a fight to the finish! Overall, great place and we'll be back again next time we're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This review is 4-1/2 stars.  Our server, Justin is AWESOME!!!!!  He made the visit a blast and a fellow server that chimed in here and there.  =)  Even the food runner had fun conversations with us.  I was on the my way home, then I get a text.  HH?  On a Friday night, after being locked in a room for 9 hours to work a project.  HELL to the yes (borrowing from Glee).  I walked in and found L & M all happy from HH specials.  The table was 3/4 full of food and drinks.  I had to join in on ordering food....  CATFISH BEIGNETS:  My favies!  Fried light and spices just right.  CAST-IRON SKILLET DUMPLINGS:  chcken and shrimp filled, the skillet get the dumpling skin to have that pan fried crispiness.    FLAT TOP GRILLED QUESADILLA:  Quesadilla - Nothing special  CHILE PORK TOSTADAS:  These are yummy.  Each clumpy of yummy pork on their crispy tostadas.   BLACKENED CATFISH TACOS:  It was more a roll than a taco.  It was ok.    NACHOS with Cheesy Something - ?  YUMMY!  Nachos and yummy melted cheese dip."}
{"text":"As per our last visit, this place is still awesome! Came here on a Sun. around 4, it was happy hr. and they had a nice crowd going.  We sat at the bar, although the bartender was really busy, he got to us immediately and checked on us throughout our visit.  We shared the shrimp tostada bites and each had a drink, such a reasonable and tasty HH menu that doesn't break the bank! :)  We will be back when in Phx. again!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the Tempe Z'Tejas for years. This one is in a unwalkable area, but it was just as tasty!  Location:  Near a strip mall of sorts. Tons of parking available.   Variety: It's typical tex mex types of food.  There are quesadillas, tacos, salads, etc.  Though one can make a meal vegetarian or vegan, it isn't as easy as other places.   Service: Quick, efficient and friendly.   Food quality:  Everyone talks about the chambord margaritas- these are an absolute must have!  Also, one is adequate!  The food itself is good, but I wouldn't say it's anything special. I go for the margaritas!   Ambiance: This is a quieter location than Tempe's location.  It was pretty quiet."}
{"text":"Great Welcoming start to a simple bite and refreshing drink for the early evening.  Very attentive right from the start .   The seating area in the bar was open and clean with the windows shades open , gives a great comfortable setting.  The waiter was amazing , we asked for suggestions and went on his choices, which were delivered fresh and delicious ! Tostada shrimp bites , and the chili verde were absolutely tasty.   The even balance out of this nice evening was the waiter and the GM !  Both these gentlemen hold the most professional of service and the determining factor of my return.   I highly recommend Z's !  Well worth the price and even if it's not the happy hour, the prices are well worth any meal , plus the Service !   Mr. J.R. Lopez"}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful. Hadn't been to Z Tejas in a while.  Food hasn't really improved.  I really like Mexican food, so this place doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Great experience on a happy hour on a Wednesday evening. The service was great (Liz was amazing ask for her) and the food came out hot and fast. She knew everything about the food and drinks and made great recommendations. She even anticipated our needs before we asked... What a great experience thank you!"}
{"text":"Permanently Closed?  Normally LOVE ZTejas but went for lunch today (Sun Oct 22) and found a sign on the door mentioning landlord eviction - perhaps a dispute on payment of rent?  There were no people and the location was closed up tight.   Not sure what's going on here, but I hope this is not permanent!!!"}
{"text":"I did not find this restaurant authentic. The salsa was not spicy or flavorful. We ended up only having drinks here because the prices were very high. The drinks were also overpriced, and very small. I would definitely suggest going to another restaurant to get more bang for your buck in Arizona. Definitely too overpriced for a place to relax and sit back and enjoy more than one drink."}
{"text":"Great drinks,  great service and I love the window ramp seating. I have been here 4 times now and have always had a good experience."}
{"text":"Just ok. Was there for a work meeting. They messed up our orders. Service was scant. Food was ok."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere here.  Its calm,  relaxing after. Long day at the office. Make sure you try the street tacos or the blackened catfish tacos. The only grioe i have is today the bartender was not as personable as the last time i will blame that on the amount of patrons the restaurant has.  No one wants to be seated elsewhere other then the bar area."}
{"text":"I love Z'Tejas, but just not this Z'Tejas. I've been to the one in Scottsdale several times, and I've had great experiences and great food every time. Here...unfortunately not.   Came here with the boyfriend for happy hour, and ordered the Tejas Trio, Blackened Catfish Tacos, and Grilled Shrimp and Guacamole Tostada bites.   1. Tejas  Trio: The cheese, guacamole, and salsa were so good! Especially love the queso dip :) Would definitely order this again.  2. Blackened Catfish Tacos: Ehh...wouldn't order it again. If it was free, I might eat it.  3. Grilled Shrimp and Guacamole Tostada bites: Had this at another Z'Tejas location before, and it is good! Unfortunately...the order came out wrong, and we got something different. So the guy who brought the plate out apologized and took it back to get us the right order...honestly, at least 20 minutes went by....our waiter comes back and asks if we got our tostada bites......uh NO. So he goes and brings it right out. Yay right? NO. It was cold. My guess is that it's been ready and just sitting in the kitchen, and it got cold by the time it got to our table.  And speaking of our waiter...all he did was take our order and filled our water every so often. He didn't ask us how our food was, didn't apologize for getting the order wrong, didn't ask if we wanted dessert, didn't ask us anything and then just gave us the check without saying thank you or have a great day. What?!!? Come on....first, we're nice people. Second...even the guy that brought us the food is nicer than our waiter. He filled our water, gave us more chips, apologized, and changed our order.   Writing this brings up a bad memory. Never again! So instead of giving this place 3 stars...I have to go down to 2. :/  Anyways, besides that, the cornbread is delicious!!! I would recommend going to another location though."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our four kids here for dinner. I had the Baja fish tacos I didn't care that much for them. My husband got the chicken burrito. He didn't care for it but I really liked it. Two of my kids got the macn' cheese. The loved it! I honestly wish I would've got the Mac n cheese. My two other kids got the chicken strips and they said they where good. We also ordered the chips and salsa and I thought the salsa was gross. Overall it was ok. I wouldn't say I hated it but I didn't love it either. They sat us quickly and the service was good. It was also quiet which I love in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Going to Z for a few years the menu and pricing has changed. Happy hour prices increased and the times changed. It doesn't seem so much of a happy hour anymore.   Corn bread was one of their specialties that was free, you now have to pay for it if you want it. Drastic changes like that, will have consumers second guess coming again.   Their 3 limit Chambord has always been, however, Dos Gringos sale the same drink and its unlimited.   Lastly, the CatFish Beignets use to be so white and fresh looking inside. Now it looks very veiny and dark. The batterer is good and that Sauce is still amazing so please do not ever change that.   I believe to stay in business, Z need to revamp their menu, prices and happy hour."}
{"text":"Just went to say hat's off too JD last night the place was packed . He was alone at the bar for the whole place and he ROCKED .... Good Job JD    ;  )"}
{"text":"Had a party of 22 in last night for a work party.  We were sat in a part of the restaurant that was quieter that the main area but still in the mix of other customers. The wait staff was very attentive and took care of our every need.  Food and drinks were great especially the shrimp tostata bites and margaritas. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Met a friend there for Christmas as we had a gift card.  Glad we had it because the food wasn't worth the prices by a LONG shot.  Nothing met our expectations.  The chicken fajitas were merely a stock chicken breast sliced up on a bed of greasy grilled onions and peppers with way too much garlic on top.  The beans were tepid and should not have been served, the coffee was certainly not premium and seemed to be cheap restaurant blend coffee.  My wife was disappointed as all of her food was too spicy with nothing available to relieve the heat (and she enjoys hot food!) Our friend had the gelatinous soup discussed in earlier posts.  Sorry to say this restaurant is occupying prime space in my neighborhood that could be occupied my a much better restaurant.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"I admit I am a regular for happy hour at the Z'Tejas at Bethany Home. It is a bit out of the way if I'm going right after work (which I usually am) but well worth the detour.   First is the ambience of the place. I love the open floor plan with the glass walls that open up during nice weather. There are automatic shades that come down when the sun is shining, but once the sun starts to set and the weather starts to cool, there is nothing better! The bar is U shaped which allows for easy conversation with others at the bar. I always meet a friendly face to talk with and pass the time.  Next is the service at the bar - wonderful! Josh, JD, Chris, Amy, Dave and David are a joy. Very attentive and friendly.  Beverages - the 6th Street Margaritas are a must! The fan favorite is the Chambord margarita. YUM!  The bar has a four screen flat TV for watching your favorite sporting event. If they are not showing what you want, just ask."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Went there for lunch and had a good Caesar salad with average tortilla soup. My friends soup didn't come out at the same time however. When I asked our server, David, when my friends food was coming he gave me attitude and walked away. I think that reaction from him was absurd when I merely asked a question. I might go back, but I won't have David serving me."}
{"text":"Consistently good service, food and drink. This is a great local spot for brunch, lunch or dinner. The table side guacamole is not to be missed or the fresh, hot cornbread. Don't forget to add a signature margarita to your order!"}
{"text":"So glad I picked this place to spend my 31st B-day....NOT! The hostess acted like she didn't know what we were there for and our server, who in the 90 minutes we were there I think I saw twice, was not personable and seemed like he was in a hurry! Our drinks took FOREVER as did getting our check! However with all that negativity they still have the best margaritas and the food was fantastic! I'll be back, just not to this location!!! Alright I gave this place another try, 4 more try's to be exact and I STILL have nothing good to say about the staff:( food and drinks are keeping me going back!"}
{"text":"I like Z'Tejas and I frequent the location in Scottsdale Fashion Square a lot.  This location just opened by my house and have been five or six times.    The food has always been the same great food I'm used to at the Scottsdale location.  The service has been great on the bar side so far.  Last night, the dinning room service was sub-par.  I'm pretty sure our server was trained and just thrown out to wolves!  The management needs to do a better job of training their team before giving them a table of seven on a busy Friday!  Hope the service improves!"}
{"text":"Server was nice.  Had to track him down for the check with only 4 other patrons in the restaurant though...not cool. Salsa was GROSS.  Like sweet spaghetti sauce.  Never had anything like that EVER, and don't wish to again. We were there on Saturday afternoon and they had a decent happy hour.  I got some street tacos for $8 and they were pretty good, but there was something strange about the flavor of the meat.  Like, \"what kind of meat IS this?\" type of strange.  It looked like beef but tasted like pork. So weird.  They did present my friend with a beautiful side salad, however.  I think if I were to return, I'd go that route. I added a star for location and décor.  It's really a nice atmosphere inside.  Other than that, I was underwhelmed with the food."}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the service here. If there is an issue with your order or if it's taking so long, the managers  walk  around to see if everything is okay. I don't normally eat a lot of carbs, but their corn bread is the bomb! Big portions, reasonable price and the food is good too! Check out their happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and it was great. Original cocktails - cucumber lime mule - were very good. We started with the Texas Trio - salsa, guacamole, and chili con queso. Very fresh, the salsa had a bit of a bite, and the con queso was very creamy and a bit spicy. It's a lot if food for 2. My husband had the Achillo marinated Mahi Mahi and I had the Diablo Pasta. The Mahi Mahi had really subtle flavors - excellent. The pasta was really creamy and a nice contrast to the jerk chicken on top. Our waiter - Jordan- was great fun. Still learning the ropes but a really authentic and funny guy. We'll definitely go back for dinner and try to sit in Jordan's area."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and they had some really great drink specials such as half off tequila Tuesdays. If it wasn't for our annoying waitress who kept referring to margaritas as \"drinkypoos\" and basically acting like a toddler, I would've given them a five."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get a nice, strong frozen margarita! We always sit in the bar, order a few frozen chambord margaritas and a Tejas Trio. Go during happy hour...Always a good time!"}
{"text":"Great Margaritas, chips and salsa and some street tacos. Bar staff is not the best but plant if TV's for Spirts watching. This place seems best for lunch. Not sure I would enjoy dinner here. Huge windows open to give almost outdoor seating when it's cool enough. Great 16th and Indian School location."}
{"text":"Zensational is Z'Tejas!    So glad one has opened up in Central Phoenix!  So the Chambord Margarita is my new favorite drink there for sure.  Sweet yet not over sour like other margaritas they serve.    Our server or servers were awesome and on the ball the entire evening.  The evening started with two of us then grew to four.  We ordered off of the happy hour appetizers menu which were really great deals for what you receive.    Loved the dumplings! They were filled with chicken and mini shrimps then seared on the bottom in a cast iron skillet.  We the pork tostados were probably the least favorite of the entrees we ordered.  The trio nachos was a good appetizer to being with.   Overall , I had a great first experience at this location.  The only thing that really destroys the evening, is trying to find parking.  Other than that, this location is huge and looks like a great place with bigger groups!"}
{"text":"I recommend the mango steak salad and the chambord margarita. I'm glad they came in to the area I no longer have to drive to the Tatum location."}
{"text":"We had one bowl of soup and two salads with two ice teas. Salads were good. Tea was in a fancy bottle but were not good. Anyways we eat out a lot and $44 for what we ordered seemed just a bit pricey. It was those $4.25 ice teas. Are you kidding me?? We'll prob try again at some point but not any time soon. If we have a better experience I'll update my review. - second attempt- this time we had an appetizer and two meals. One water and one soda ($36 no bad at all). I gotta say the food is pretty darn good as stated in first review. I think the expensive tea had me a \"little\" irritated. The bill was very reasonable this time.  They were understaffed as relayed to me by a server so there was a bit of a lag time but we could hang just fine with the appetizer. We'll be back.. Just no tea"}
{"text":"It's consistently pretty good.  It's chain food, and I am a little against big corporate restaurants as they are all pretty vanilla.  That said there is nothing run of the mill about their chambord margarita."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what is the entire hype on this place. I don't think their appetizers are that great. I ordered a mule and it was probably the only thing I liked. It isn't the best place in my opinion for happy hour as they don't have a huge variety of options in their happy hour menu. At least that caught my attention and appetite."}
{"text":"I've been to the location on Tatum many times and always enjoyed the food. I assumed the food would be the same at every location, not true. My husband & I both ordered the diablo pasta with shrimp. We both thought the dish was bland. In the past it had lots of flavor plus a little heat, not this time.   Also, we went on Cinco de Mayo. They had $2 Coronas, but ran out. How is that possible? We may return then again we may not."}
{"text":"I've been going to z tejas for years. I have visited this one a few times since its been open and it is my least favorite location. On the three ocassions I have been over the last year my food has either been wrong, cold or taken forever. Or all 3. They have a great menu so its disappointing when the service is not up to par, to me its purely a management problem. The bartender was tending bar, taking orders for at least 5 tables in the bar area and cleaning. The host was hosting and running food. It was not a good recipe for good service. I will keep visiting z tejas but will likely go to the one at Fashion Square mall even though this one is way closer. I am also not a huge fan that they now charge for cornbread that has been complimentary for years. Its only $3 so its not like its breaking the bank and the cornbread is good...so I guess its just the principle that its been their signature compliment for years and now you pay."}
{"text":"Decent TexMex style food. In this area there is a lot of Mexican restaurants, this one leans towards Texas style. Margaritas were delicious and authentic beef skirt steak fajitas were also tasty! The one area where this restaurant failed was service. Unfortunately our waiter wasn't very attentive and only offered a bare minimum effort."}
{"text":"We ate here monday for lunch and I have to say we are fans and will definitely be back. The food was wonderful and the bartender Becca was very tentative. Our drinks were filled the whole time and our food was correct to my specifications. On top of that the food was fantastic! All around a great place."}
{"text":"A weak start but a strong finish . . . . . .    The wife and I spent the weekend in Arizona. While visiting some friends there, we made a special visit to Z'Tejas. This place was spoken of highly and came highly recommended.   I was impressed from the start. Walking up to this joint, it looked nice and modern. The outer walls rolled up allowing plenty of fresh air in and an open environment. The dim lighting and unique oil paintings provided an elegant yet romantic energy. I liked it immediately. However, I gotta say, the mint colored  table clothes were hideous. But it was like the staff heard me say that to my wife because they changed them to white almost immediately.   It took almost 10 minutes to get service. When I stood up and began looking for a server, she approached me and explained that her last table was a nightmare. She was awesome from there. Further more, she introduced herself (Chris) twice and was perfect from there on out. Personally, I like when servers offer suggestions or their favorites. Shows they care.   The appetizer was retarded good! It was comprised of a spicy avocado and shrimp topping on a crispy cracker. The spicy avocado and smoked shrimp were battling for dominance. But together, they were a dream. I could have eaten 50 of them summa-bitches.   My entree was even better. It was comprised of four pork tenderloin medallions stuffed with chorizo. I mean, really? Who thinks of this? It was like art!  Damn near belongs in a museum.   To top it off, we had Kalua cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was fresh, moist, and otherwise perfectly executed. A Kalua based sauce was drizzled over the top of each slice. This slice could have gone toe-to-toe with The Cheescake Factory. Real Talk!   Overall, I really liked this place. LikemBrooks and Dunn said, it just gets better all the time. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. The chip trio is always great, the white queso has a great kick to it. We split the diablo pasta, the vegetatian chopped salad, and blackened catfish tacos. The fish tacos were gone before I could look up! The tri-color pasta had a perfect balance of cream and spice, while the shrimp completed the perfect bite! Jacob was our server, adorable, engaging, and efficient! Our table was cleared from appetizer before food came- clean eating! Oh, and the salad was a great  and refreshing neutralizer from the spice off of both of the plates! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with this visit. Their happy hour is great but the dinner was not. I ordered the Santa Fe chicken enchiladas. The chicken was very dry and and the flavor was just ok. Not much else to say..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, and have always had a pretty good experience, but tonight the staff really went above and beyond.   My boyfriend has a pretty severe dairy and egg allergy, and let the server know while he was ordering to ensure his food wouldn't have those things in it. When the steak burrito he ordered came out, it looked like it had some sort of cream or cheese in it so we let the server know our concern. The manager came to our table and apologized about not being told our table had an allergy and therefore hadn't done the normal allergy process with the dish and was taking steps to rectify it.   The burrito came back pretty quickly. The chef had taken lots of care to put all of the salsa/pico on the side and changed the seasonal rice to fries (the rice had dairy in it as well). She then explained how z tejas has this whole non-contaminated area they prepare dishes like this and then comped the burrito which was really kind of her to do.   We were so impressed with how the situation was handled, and are excited to know there's a place close by that takes allergies very seriously :)"}
{"text":"Although our waiter was very nice, he quoted the wrong special and I received the wrong meal.  My husband got his meal 15 minutes before I got mine and we were unable to dine together lest his food get cold.  And the seafood enchilada, which I ordered in lieu of the special, was not to my liking.  For all of the inconvenience, we were given a coupon for a free appetizer the next time we dine there.  Yeah, right, as though we would go back.  I will stick with Richardson's/Rokerij/Dick's Hideaway in the future if I want great Southwestern food.  Also, it was FREEZING inside.  I agree with other reviewers who said that the food is bland and swimming in icky sauces."}
{"text":"Our company had an event at this location today, I was pleasantly surprised, really enjoyed the food, it was fresh, yummy & properly cooked, two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Z'Tejas. The first one was born in a 100 year old Victorian house on Austin's historic 6th Street. Number two Scottsdale. This one is number 11, built from scratch and is lookin mighty fine with her breezy open air.  Located amongst several of my favorite dinner houses on Street16 & Bethany Home Road.  The restaurant on opening day is packed. The staff are all in their Sunday best and look great. Everyone that spoke to me was professional, prompt and I always enjoy the gals that open the door for me. I sit at the bar and quickly order the HH 6th street Margarita rocks $6. A strong delicious mix drink. I am enjoying my chats while spying on the views of the house.   My appetite is light today so I order the HH Shrimp Tostada Bites $7. This plate has 8 pretty fancy eatables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztejas-southwestern-grill-phoenix-2?select=11W6zvGtDBZJXfmEzk8tJQ#11W6zvGtDBZJXfmEzk8tJQ   These are very delicious and I found the receipe: Guacamole: Avocado 3 each Tomato (diced) 1 each Red Onion (diced) 1/2 each Lime for Juice 1 each Cilantro 3 Tbls Jalapeño (diced) 1 each (deseeded) Sour Cream 1/4 cup Grilled Shrimp: Shrimp (peeled/deveined) 24 each Cilantro Pesto 1 cup Guacamole Chipotle Puree 1/4 cup Dob onto 24 small, fresh chips of your choosing, laying the shrimp on top.  I finished with a shot of Don Julio Anejo $9.5   This is a good time."}
{"text":"Z Tejas may be a chain, but it is a great one!  So much of their food is unique and incredibly tasty. First thing you need to know is that their margaritas are killer strong and one or two is definitely enough. For appetizers, their queso dip and guacamole is amazing. But definitely don't miss their shrimp tostada bites!  My favorite salad is the steak and mango salad but there trout salad is really great too. Don't miss out on mushroom enchiladas!  I also really enjoy their street tacos. It's a really corporate standardized environment so if you prefer more of a neighborhood/local restaurant you won't like Z Tejas. If you're not that picky, definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Terrible Zervice but great foodzz!     We sat at the bar, it was a slow night only 4 others were sitting at the bar.  Bartender ignored us!  He was cleaning.  Finally he took our order after about 10 minutes. We almost got up and left.       The food was delicious, we had the green chili pork stew with tortillas.  The food runner was great he saved the day, I wish I could remember his name to thank him, he attended to all of our requests for hot sauce and more tortillas.   Usually my experiences at  Ztejas  are  great! The food is consistently good and the Mango Margaritas are wonderful. This location needs to step up to the great service we always have at  the location on  Tatum and at Scottsdale Fashion Square location.   This new Ztejas is beautiful with a gorgeous patio and would be great this time of year to sit outside.  We may give them another chance."}
{"text":"This place needs to step it up, and keep the brand promise. The other night, we went there for a quick bite before going to a concert. The place was fairly empty, so we thought we would be able to get in-and-out fairly quickly. Nope. The service was SLOW, inattentive, and apathetic. I had the chicken tortilla soup and it was luke warm, with the consistency and taste of repurposed gravy rather than a fresh, chunky and authentic tortilla soup. My fiance had their Diablo Pasta, supposedly one of their signature dishes. The portion was small and no diablo, as it was not as spicy as it had claimed to be. No bueno. I guess this location is more interested in being a happy hour bar rather than a restaurant that consistently puts out good food, good service and a good dining vibe. There are too many great restaurants out there for mediocrity. You can't live on the chambord margarita legend forever!"}
{"text":"I was a little bummed to see a chain restaurant open in the neighborhood, but figured I'd give it a chance. That was a mistake. Went with a large party. Everyone's food, and I mean everyone's was over sauced. Not one person finished their meal. Most barely made a dent. We ALL agreed is was just not good.  So sad. Something locally owned would have been a much better addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went there for an early after diamondbacks game dinner. Ugh, not a fan at all. Not only is it decorated completely ugly, they seemed very confused on what direction they were going with when they were decorating the place. The food was alright, nothing that wowed us. What made me give only 1 star was the incredibly horrible service.  Our server was barely at the table, completely forgot that we were having the Sunday preset menu, brought us the check way too early, but kept forgetting to bring a togo box, so when we'd see her more than 10 minutes later, she'd laugh about it, disappear for another 10 minutes, and come back without a box again, then laughed about it. I would have complained to a manager, but at that point we just wanted to go home. Needless to say we won't return, which is a shame since it's so close to home. DISLIKE"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they first opened, the first couple of years was touch and go with service and food.   I have to say I have seen a dramatic difference in service. Yesterday I had lunch in bar, Trevor was absolutely amazing as have been ALL of our servers when we have sat in the bar.  Our water and teas were refilled immediately without asking, and the food was better than before!   The pecan crusted chicken salad is my new favorite!  Though the corn bread use to be free, its still well worth the purchase!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming to say the least. New to Phoenix and had seen this place around the city so was excited to try it out.  I guess I'll start with the happy hour skinny margarita I ordered.. $5 happy hour price for a watered down, overly iced concoction.. Not worth it and would certainly not worth the non happy hour price.   The chile con queso was tasty but we were kind of surprised that it came out somewhat lukewarm. We came in a little before 4 pm so not busy at all.. You think it'd came out piping hot.   My fiancé ordered the chicken enchiladas. We're both not picky but we both agreed they tasted like rubber.. Like the taste of what a garage smells like. It was so odd!   I ordered the appetizer quesadilla as my entree and it was okay. Nothing crazy.  I don't think we'll be back.. Too many other tasty Mexican joints in this town that  are cheaper and way tastier!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times since my awful experience and since Z'Tejas' followed up with me --and I must say - they have really stepped up service at this place. Servers are now more attentive/friendly/in a good mood, drinks stay filled, managers stop by to check on guests and if there's an issue (there was a small issue at a neighboring table at one of my recent visits) the manager fixes it to the customer's satisfaction. Thank you, Z'Tejas for taking my feedback seriously and implementing such positive change.   Also wanted to add for anyone looking for food recommendations: My favorite menu items here are the tableside guacamole, street tacos, wild mushroom enchiladas and the ancho chile fudge pie. You also can't go wrong with their brunch menu - personal faves are chicken/potato hash and the Migas (I add chicken)."}
{"text":"Nothing like a $24 dollar lunch! Went here for lunch with  five coworkers and I thought it was WAY overpriced for what you get. They don't even offer chips while you wait for your food. Happy Hours prices - the only time to eat here!"}
{"text":"3rd time eating here, first time reviewing.  Went to the location on Shea the first time. Accidentally got there in time for happy hour apps. The cornbread was gratis and plentiful. I could have sworn that the deal was 1/2 price apps back then (a few months ago). We liked the taste of the apps so much that it called for a second visit. Also the location on Shea. Cornbread was gratis. This time we were too late for happy hour. We opted for entrees instead (fajitas and a burger) which were only so-so. We decided never again for entrees, the apps at full price are a better deal.  Came to the location on Bethany Home this time. In time for happy hour. No free cornbread. It's now $3. And, the apps are discounted $3 - still a good deal. Had the mini shrimp tostadas, chicken quesadillas and the street tacos. Very tasty! Ancho fudge pie for dessert. Oh yeah!  We arrived shortly after 6. The restaurant was almost empty. We were greeted immediately and seated right away. Our server arrived and got the drink orders in. The timing of the apps was quick. Nicely plated and really good flavors.  When it came time for dessert, things kind of fell apart. Our server took the order and then re-appeared about a minute later with the tab. We thought she was going off shift and another server was with her who took drink re-fill orders from us. Our main server was still visible working other tables. Confusing! 15 minutes after ordering dessert we flagged down server #2 who seemed disinterested in our table at that time. She didn't know anything about the dessert order taken by server #1. We got the dessert about a minute later - I think it had been sitting on the pass for many minutes by then. Oh well. It tasted amazing. Dense chocolate flavor with interesting spices. And, the crust was excellent.  Will come back. But, only during happy hour as the discounted apps are a great deal. I don't think there is value at full price."}
{"text":"I think they specifically seek out the nicest people in Phoenix and hire them to work at Z'Tejas. Also a walking distance spot for me and I really enjoy going. The margaritas are good, happy hour prices are great, the staff - as mentioned - is awesome and the food is good. It has cool decor and a nice environment and I'm happy to have them in my hood."}
{"text":"We had lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Service was very good. Ambiance pleasant. We had a variety of entrees at our table, salads, burgers, enchiladas. Everyone appeared happy with their good as the plates were emptied. We did notice a killer Bloody Mary bar halfway through lunch that would have been fun to try. Very good all around and will return."}
{"text":"New building...very open, modern and inviting.  Ate at the bar which is excellent for people watching.  Everyone was professional, friendly and I love that the staff doesn't all have the same boring uniform.  Dale the bartender was awesome!  So happy that this joint  has moved into my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The food at Z'Tejas is just ok.  Except for the cornbread.  And the cobbler dessert. But this place gets a 5 star rating for the staff, the dining experience and the great service.  In a neighborhood filled with great places to eat, this Z'Tejas location should be in everyone's regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm able to get out of work early and enjoy a cocktail with some friends Z'Tejas happens to be the place we end up!   They're happy hour and atmosphere is great. This last visit we tried the grilled shrimp and guacamole tostada bites and the child pork verde - both were very delicious and perfect for sharing. I only gave 4 star review because the service was okay and could have been a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Food is pricey, but they do have live music sometimes for free, so that helps.  Service is good."}
{"text":"Today was my first experience at this restaurant. It was amazing! I wanted something that isn't normally served during brunch but the manager took the time to see if the chef would make it for me. It was the pan-poached Cod for Hatch Chile Fest! It was outstanding. Service was fast and attentive. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food has been solid the las 10 or so times we have come in for lunch as well as dinner.  They had some kitchen issues in the past and for a while we stopped going in.  A couple familiar faces as servers are still here.  Jon always takes good care of his people.  Drinks are solid and delicious.  I had the trout for the first time and it sure won't be the last.  Contrary to rumors in the papers and on the news the Z is doing just fine and media needs to get full story and records straight.  Come on in and enjoy the food....the people... And just sit back and chill"}
{"text":"Great indoor and outdoor atmosphere dinning setting. Great for anyone to enjoy a nice meal and good chats. Nice full bar area. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Our server Josh was phenomenal! We ordered HH, street tacos, Cesar, shrimp tostado bites, trio chips & dip, all excellent! Complimentary cornbread! Seared Ahi was too sweet but everything else promptly served and table cleared quickly, hate dirty plates sitting at the table. Beers were served very quickly, love the attention to our table. We're from Portland and loved the reasonable bill. The bathroom is brand spanking new! Everything is spotless!"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  The drinks are fabulous!  And most of the staff is outstanding.  I think its easy to find the 7's when you more often than not get level 10 servers!  I feel terrible I cant remember her name but Lynette? maybe? is amazing!  I adore and I have to say I so appreciate that EVERY female that works there always looks impeccable.  Great hair great make-up freshly pressed clothes great smiles!  Grooming is so huge in service and I feel like people miss that all the time.  Not these people!  All the food is great and you have to get the watermelon jalapeno  margarita!"}
{"text":"We always have a Great experience here! The manager, Tana, is everything and more that you would want in a manager when it comes to customer service.  Even when something is off (which rarely happens), she addresses it right then and makes everything Perfect!  We will definitely be back, again, again and again!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets one star is due to the decent lighting and my food was okay. The service by our server \"sunshine\" was a joke. She took forever for everything, they took almost 20min to ask us what we wanted to drink, my wife's drink was horrible, she gave me the bill before asking us if we were done, and the overall all experience was disgusting at best. Servers like this give restaurants bad reputations. If you happen to get sunshine as your server then brace yourself and gather patience... It's going to be a long one"}
{"text":"This is a fairly predictable Tex-Mex chain style restaurant.  The food and drinks were average.  I wouldn't mind eating here, but definitely would not go out of my way for a meal here."}
{"text":"Took over 20mins to just get our drinks. The steak in my burrito came out ice cold then took 20mins to get right.  Never even got my refill on my drink. Never going back"}
{"text":"If you've been to the other locations, you're already familiar with the food (which, by itself, is probably 3-stars) and the chambord margaritas (which, by themselves, garner 4 stars from me), so I won't delve into those things.  I love the location, although parking is a problem.  The complimentary valet is a nice touch, but it takes a while for them to bring your car around because it seems like the poor guys have to run all the way down to Missouri to park your car.  The windows are huge doors that they open up at night, which is a really nice touch.  The design is much more open and light than their other locations."}
{"text":"Overly priced. Very loud. If u are looking for a nice quiet date night this is not the place. Food was average and definitely overly priced. Very disappointed. Servers were good though."}
{"text":"Waitresses great. Happy hour was delicious. The catfish tacos were a great choice. As always the house margarita is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Just not good.  The few times I went I gazed longingly across the street at The Garage...where the food is actually good and I'm not pissed when the check comes to the table."}
{"text":"I dined at Z'Tejas last night (12/19/13) on Bethany Home Road. This was my third visit to this location. My prior visits were excellent, however, last night was not good. I will say the food was excellent but the service was not. My friend and I arrived at about 5:40pm. We were greeted promptly and we ordered our cocktails, appetizer and main courses all at the same time. Our drinks arrived and then our appetizer shortly after. Great we were happy. Literally 2 bites of the appetizer and our main courses arrived. I was shocked. When our waiter came over to see how we were doing I told him that I not thrilled that our main course arrived just about on top of the appetizer ( we ate the appetizer with our main course) the waiter laughed it off and said gee when you want the food in a hurry it doesn't come so go figure. Here is the best part of this ridiculous dinner: we arrived at 5:40pm and we were done eating by 6:15pm. How absurd is that? Think of the revenue the restaurant lost - I was ready to have 2-3 glasses of wine during my leisurely meal yet I had barely drank half of my glass of wine by the time I finished my meal. I should have complained to the manager but I was too irritated to do that. While I really like the food there I will hesitate to go back. That is a shame because my prior experiences were very good but last night their customer service was awful."}
{"text":"Its tough, as a resident of this area, to support a corporate chain coming into the neighborhood, but Z Tejas is a welcome addition.  The bar area design is very cool, but the dining room decor is very lack luster - who sits in dining rooms anymore?  The service is always fantastic, even at peak times!"}
