{"text":"Such an amazing spot! The manager truly goes above and beyond with the amazing customer service they provide. The vibe is chill, and is such a great place for a date, meeting or study sesh. The food is all home baked and the overall place just gives you a comfortable, relaxed vibe. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had their \"signature\" omlett and a pino colada smoothie (which was very sweet). Everything was pretty average. Nothing exceptional for the price, which was a little on the high-side for Kensington. The people seemed friendly but probably wouldn't go back. Room for improvement on these two items."}
{"text":"Tried the passionfruit sample when they had a temporary location at the Front St food market next to Union Station, totally got hooked and ended up getting an entire scoop.  It was very refreshing and full of flavour.  It might be my imagination, but I think Eative's sorbet didn't melt as fast as the usual gelato or sorbet (is it because of the liquid nitrogen?).  This means you can savour it in the humid weather rather than eating it as fast as possible to avoid a puddle of goo in your cone/cup and risking brain freeze.  

I keep meaning to visit their official location to try other flavours and see the business in operation.  Will post an update if/when I do."}
{"text":"Loved the banana hot chocolate which is great choice for someone who loves bananas and chocolate...served hot....in that exact order. It is a sure why to impress a date with the atmosphere and oldies music, which is accompanied with classic movies playing in the background which is good for screenwriters trying to make it in the biz without resorting to Starbucks since it is played out. Nitro coffee is also very delicious and feels like having NOS in the body."}
{"text":"Good coffee but small portions for the price.  They forgot my husband's order and I had to remind them about it.  Food is good though and cafe is cute.  Disappointed in the service though."}
{"text":"I was walking by, the place is cute and since it offered all day breakfast we decided to try it out. What a disappointment!!! Food took like 20min (or more) to come and portions were small. The omelette was ok, supposedly had sour cream and ended being cream cheese. It was dripping fat all over and since it comes with nothing on the side I paid for \"side salad\" and it literally was 5 lettuce leaves drenched in some white dressing (I assume ranch??) and one tiny grape tomato, yup, one. 

I see great reviews for this place and I am now wondering if we visited the same place?? I didn't try the ice cream or the coffee which is what people mostly rave about, I just had the omelette and it sucked. I left hungry and I will never visit this place again"}
{"text":"I am really growing to love Eative. 

I am having a really difficult time in the downtown core finding a neighborhood coffee joint that is not filled with hipsters, so this place is perfect for me.

The great things about this place are:

- spacious and filled with sunlight
- good food & drinks
- comfortable chairs
- good warm weather patio
- very few hipsters taking up space
- located in my favorite neighborhood

There is also one last point about Eative that I need to give them a lot of respect for.  Their bathrooms are fantastically clean.  Why?  Because in order to use them, you need to use a special code. And in order to get that code, you need to buy something, where you will find the code on the receipt.  Amazing.  The same thing goes for their wifi, which isn't bogged down - because only paying customers get access (via receipt) to their constantly changing wifi password.  In my opinion, this is amazing!

So... I realize by giving this review, I am kind of shooting myself in the foot by (perhaps) drawing more people to this place, but I also want to give local businesses the props they deserve.

Love Eative."}
{"text":"A lovely small place with a chill vibe. The Japanese omelet was recommended so I gave it a try and no regrets!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The butter coffee Amazing!!! This area is so awesome Kensington Market"}
{"text":"I love this place and I almost don't want to review it so that it doesn't become too too popular! I'm kidding. The coffee is excellent, and they're willing to walk you through the different brewing formats, etc. I didn't try their gelato, but I've heard that it's very good and I'll definitely give it a try. I love that I can sip an Americano or cold brew and watch a silent movie at the same time. I also noticed they have a huge patio, which is beautiful. The place is spacious and there is Wi-Fi, and would be a great place for a date, a study date, or even people watching by the window facing Kensington market."}
{"text":"Massively overpriced to me. I got a regular  \"iced cappuccino\" and it was over $5! It was essentially an iced coffee. Perhaps I just ordered poorly, but honestly it seems to me like it isn't worth the price compared to the other cheaper places nearby. Other than that, it has a nice enough ambience to earn it some stars. I can't say I have experience with much else of the menu, so it's possible that they have some good food. Still would not go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by here to grab a cup of coffee for the first time.  We took our seats and my clumsy girlfriend spilled her drink all over the floor.  Staff was quick to clean it up and replaced the drink free of charge!  Other than their great customer service, the cafe offers a variety of treats; from their mouth watering chocolate cakes to their bite size cookies.  Would definitely come back to try them."}
{"text":"Film Cafe is one of Kensington's gems. A perfect balance of film noir, with Tokyo street food and gourmet drinks, it creates an environment that I've never quite experienced before. It definitely was one of my main study spots up until recently.

Ambiance, especially when it comes to cafes is really important. One of my favourite things about this place, or was anyway, was them playing film noir films that really, helped capture the namesake of the cafe. It also reflects an open concept movie in the park cafe. However, the past few visits to the cafe, they switched to playing Looney Tunes or Hanna Barbara cartoons. It might not bother anyone else, but it's called Film cafe. I feel like when you name your establishment after a theme, it's a little disappointing to not be congruent to it.

Foodwise, everything I've ever had is delicious. I had the Pork Katsu before, which came as a set, with cabbage, rice and miso soup. Crispy, and moist on the inside, which helps fuel any intense study sessions. I've had a few pastries from the place before, and it was all palatable. 

I've almost tried all the drinks on the menu. One of the more unique drinks is the one where they paired coffee and coconut water, that gives you a refreshing Iced Americano if you will, really perfect for the coming hot summer days. 

Overall, I still have a place in my heart for the film cafe with many long nights in this cozy space. However, they recently rearranged the cafe which kind of changed the vibe a little. I would have given the place a flourish of stars, but that less than on point movie showing just made feel like it's more of a four star establishment."}
{"text":"I like Tokyo street food and while the choices here are a little slim, the entrees are delicious and the beer is cold. First time I was here I tried the grilled cheese sandwich and it was wonderful. 

On my latest visit, I had the deep-fried pork chop and Japanese slaw which were also wonderful. I guess my experience here is wonderful. Well, except for the ambiance which I found on par with a typical Starbucks (lots of table-hogging, computer types sipping the single coffee they probably bought six hours ago). Also, they had run out of draft beer and we were stuck with canned.

Good location though, in the heart of Kensington Market and an okay spot to grab a quick meal."}
{"text":"What a lovely place to grab a bite!   I enjoyed a late breakfast, ordering a Tokyo Omelet and a latte.  The omelette was like a millefeulle--many fine egg layers rolled up and it was served with purple rice onigiri--beautifully presented.  The latte was perfectly frothed and delicious.  I sat in the courtyard on a September morning with the sunshine streaming in--wonderful"}
{"text":"Trendy place and a great place to just chill out, catch up some work, or just be in the moment with people. 

I had the Matcha Sense and you can really taste matcha unlike other places that offers matcha drinks that doesn't even taste like one. I kind of regretted not ordering a hot drink because I saw some online posts that they do latte art. I also had their Takoyaki and it wasn't bad. They serve 5 pieces in one order. I think their prices are a bit too high. 

If I ever plan in going back here, I would love to try their all day breakfast food. They sound big and delicious."}
{"text":"This liquid nitrogen thing is pretty cool.  Get it?  COOL???  :)

This place has four flavours to choose from, all of which are two flavour combos. I tried the passion fruit and guava.  Yummy.  

$6.99 was okay because everything is expensive here.  Well, not the $0.99 spaghetti stand. 

Tax was included which is always a nice surprise.  

Guilt free, no/low fat treat.  It exists at the CNE!!!"}
{"text":"I walked in to grab a coffee and cake whiling doing some work. I was inquiring about some menu items and started choking, after repeatedly coughing I asked the cashier for a glass of water. She looked at me and said \"water is for customers\". WATER, for a choking patron in this restaurant will only be provided if you first stop choking to whip out your wallet and complete a transaction."}
{"text":"All for supporting local business but this place's quality and pricing make it way harder. Why does a espresso with ice cost more than a ice latte at Jimmy's? Rather support \"Livelihood\" (in the spot of what was casa coffee) or Jimmy's, there's a couple shops up on College. Honestly anywhere is better than here.... even Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"It's sometimes hard not to be a little apprehensive when you walk in and the place is empty, especially on a Sunday morning. We, however, trusted the reviews and just went with it. I had the spinach omelet, which had to be one of the better omelets I've had! Merry that with one of their Americanos and it makes for a great breakfast!  

We sort of missed that they had a patio but the inside was okay and the film theme was interesting."}
{"text":"Banana hot chocolate and takoyaki was sooo good. The service was quick and the cafe was clean and quiet. Would come again if I ever visit Kensington market again!"}
{"text":"This place was REALLY good.  My girlfriend and I both had the Shrimp Katsu in a Coconut Curry Sauce, which came with Purple Rice, cabbage and Miso soup.  I really really enjoyed this meal and have honestly been thinking about it since, haha.

The service was very nice and speedy! 

You do go up to the counter to order, they give you a number for the table, and then they bring out your meal to you!  

They have a patio outback too with about 4 tables, which is where we sat and it was very nice and cool on the way we went! 

This restaurant also sold the 24K ice cream cones, which was super cool!!  I saw a lot of people get them while we were there.

I say expect to spend about $25 USD for two people here.

Definitely recommend.  Not to mention it's in Kensington Market, which is a really cool area!"}
{"text":"I could not locate their ice cream menu and thought they only sold vanilla ice cream (which was advertised with the gold leaves). So I got the vanilla ice cream cone for ~$7. The ice cream itself was creamy and your standard ice cream! Stars off because my cone (without a napkin) was passed on from the cashier to two different people before it was filled. They could do more to improve sanitary conditions."}
{"text":"In comparison with other cafe's in Kensington Market, Film rank's pretty low. 
To start the staff are not friendly at all, not what you would expect from a cafe. 
Film Cafe is also over priced, almost $7 for an Americano and cookie? (the cookie was definitely not fresh. 
It's also very warm inside, no good air conditioning.
All in All, Kensington market is home to Toronto's best restaurants, bars and cafe's but Film Cafe is clearly an exception."}
{"text":"Really laid back and chill atmosphere, the plants, A/C, and outdoor patio make the restaurant feel so relaxing especially on a hot summer day.

I got the liquid nitrogen lychee and guanabana sorbet at small size for $4 (Large for $6). It looked a but underwhelming at first but I was blown away by how smooth and rich it tasted.

They also offer coffee, lattes, smoothies, and gelato.

Service was very friendly and they knew what they were doing. Seating is great, lots of open space and apparently they shoe Netflix movies projected onto the wall?!

Overall a cool new addition to Kensington Market and a  great place to eat and enjoy time with friends - will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Nice Cafe, good coffee, good cheese cake and good food. What else one desires?

They have Japanese style street food, sushi, and omelets which makes it a perfect destination for brunch."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for the Looseleaf Magazine Vol. 3 event launch and it was such a cute, and surprisingly spacious hipster space in the heart of Kensington Market (across Dolce Gelato) perfect for art presentations, film screenings and live musical performances. Eative by Film Cafe was serving complimentary coffee and tea and it was all so tasty! Since then I went to visit one or two more times, and have loved the productive inclusive space. People from all walks of life come here - from elderly couples to young college students to local artists."}
{"text":"Randomly walking in here was one of the best accidents to happen this year. 

I had no idea even after ordering that I would be enjoying an amazing Japanese brunch. And the way they use their eggs is so different than a typical North American breakfast. I've never had a breakfast like this in Toronto before. 

There are many new brunch spots opening in the city but they all serve minor variations of the same things. This place is on the other hand is very different."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate because I like this place a lot but the iced lemon cold brew is just too terrible to ignore. Rather than a refund, I was hoping to pay another $6.50 to put toward something else. For costs and materials, it's similar to them making another sale. But since I have to keep this drink, they'll have to keep this review. I'm always open to changing it to 4 stars if I have a better experience next time though.

??????

P.S. all the food I've tried (5 dishes on their menu so far) is good though so go try that."}
{"text":"Decor:  Very cute cafe.  Lots of wood, very open feeling with the doors and windows open to the outside street, plus a cute little patio with lights strung above.  (Birds are slightly aggressive on the patio)

We arrived around 11 and were shocked to find out that the kitchen was closed for the next hour.  Seems like a very odd time for your kitchen to close, but to each his own.

Drinks/Food

We each ordered a Coconut Butter Coffee.  What is that?  Beats me, but it was tasty and I could taste a bit of each of the aforementioned ingredients in the name.  While I enjoyed it, I think it might be a touch light on the caffeine so if you're looking for your first coffee of the day you might want to go with a regular coffee.  

We also shared a Poppyseed Lemon Muffin and a piece of banana bread.  The banana bread by itself is worth a return trip.  Not sure how they got it so moist and yet consistently textured like banana bread should be, but I was thoroughly impressed.  The muffin was actually very good too.  Maybe next time I'll be able to get some real food."}
{"text":"This was our first culinary stop in Toronto and we LOVED it! Great atmosphere, service, and food. 

Do not skip the Poutine!! It's incredible. I asked for the wasabi mayo on the side, which I realize is a little annoying, but they were super accommodating. In addition, we got a couple beers and pork gyoza, which were also delish."}
{"text":"We stopped into this little café in Kensington village which looked better than it actually was. It is really a coffee house where people stop in to use the Internet the food here is not recommended. We ordered some sushi, a spicy tuna roll. It was actually a California roll with some type of placed on top that almost resembled a crab dip. It was not good. Also ordered was a Japanese fried chicken chunks that were just OK not too good either. The bright spot of the food there was the homemade mushroom soup which was good and the pancake breakfast. Also the table service here is spotty it's hard to figure out where you need to go and how you need to order.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"During Summer I went here with my friend. She ordered fruit smoothy and I asked if matcha latte was available in iced. The server said yes so I ordered it but I was served hot matcha latte. I told the people behind the counter that I ordered iced but all they did was stare at me for good 30 seconds like I had asked something very unreasonable. At the end they just gave me few ice cubes in a new cup so I can put them in my latte which... only makes lukewarm latte? If iced matcha latte wasn't available I would have ordered something else. Them just staring at me was such a weird experience and the whole thing kinda just threw me off. Their lack of customer service is real."}
{"text":"A nice place to relax and have a hot drink. 

I read the reviews and hoped they still had the 3D latte art thing where they take your picture and print it onto your coffee. They don't have it anymore. Sad times. They do, however, have coconut butter coffee and yellow melon hot chocolate, both of which we tried. Each of those cost $5. It's not super cheap, but when we take into account that we sat there for like an hour, it's not so bad. I'm not a coffee drinker, but the coconut butter coffee at half sweet was surprisingly good. I couldn't taste the coconut, but there was a hint of butter flavor in the coffee foam. The hot chocolate was smooth and not too sweet. There was a hint of melon in there, especially in the aftertaste, but other than that, it just tasted like hot chocolate that wasn't super rich. That isn't to say it was watery. It was milky. 

This place also has nice, clean washrooms. The code for the girl's washroom and the guy's washroom are different, so make sure you ask for the right code."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was such a treat to stumble upon while in Toronto. It's a fun location on a Main Street that you can wander down once you're stuffed with their Asian-fusion dishes, such as the curry poutine, breakfast plate, and shrimp and curry plate. We also tried the chocolate croissant which paired nicely with our coffees. We would love to come here again, especially for the poutine."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this café I thought the atmosphere was pretty good but in terms of the food I thought the rice bowl with pork belly was OK tasting but it wasn't really the best dish I had unfortunately it was way too fatty and I didn't really finish my food unfortunately :( however the pink Sakura latte that they had there taste amazing!

The latte was pretty much on the pricey side but it was pretty good!

I'll come back once I'm in the Kensington market area but definitely I might order something else that's not super big next so I probably will try the sushi there!"}
{"text":"Overall TERRIBLE experience. I was excited by the lengthy unique menu and decided to order pancakes. It took 25 minutes for them to deliver my order when there was about 3 other customers. 25 minutes. What I got was stale tasting slabs of pancakes lathered in Nutella and whipped cream to cover up the taste."}
{"text":"Sucks when you pay about 8 bucks for a fruit smoothie, that had no real fruit in it.  Slush, ice, sugar, had all that.
Mango peach was disappointing."}
{"text":"After walking around Kensington Market, we stopped by Film Cafe by Eative. The cafe was decorated with vintage film antiques. It's a pay and pick up type of cafe. Despite the cold weather, I ordered a Lychee Peachy Smoothie, which consisted of fresh fruit or real fruit juices from guarabana, lychee, mango, and peach. It was fruity, quench thirsting, and refreshing. I liked how it wasn't too sweet."}
{"text":"Quaint, quiet place where you can grab brunch, lunch, meal, coffee, or a real drink. Definitely great for catching up; the food is pretty decent as well! 

Came here on a weekday in the afternoon to catch up with some old friends. You pretty much serve yourself here. We found seats and ordered our food up front at the cashier. Someone will then bring the food and drinks to your table. Simple pimple. 

Soup of the Day - Mushroom Soup 
I found that this hit the spot for me. But it definitely also tasted a lot like Campbell's mushroom soup, with more sliced mushrooms in it, which makes me wonder. 

Takoyaki
Ah, this is my kind of food now. Delish for sure. A bit heavy on a dough in my opinion, but not too bad. 

If you're looking for just a cafe, I would recommend to look elsewhere though. The tea and coffee just seem a bit too steep (ha!), especially for the Kensington hood where there are so many around every corner. As for food, it's not bad, but I can't say that I'd be dying to come here again. 

The novelty of the black and white film playing in the background is quite rustic and lovely. Not enough for me to recommend this restaurant/cafe, but a nice place overall if you do decide to visit."}
{"text":"So on the same evening after our dinner at Sumac, my friend and I took shelter from the wind and chilly at Eative.
I definitely liked the layout of the sitting area which was a up a few short steps where a large canvas was hung up on a wall for showing movies. And also by the entrance was the coffee bar with their own selection of cakes and some tea blends, and also what I can describe as a \"see through\" kitchen because that's what I was able to view when I looking past the baristas while making my order.
I first tried a Machiatto which was well... okay this is the first time I ever tried a non-Starbucks Caramel Machiatto which is usually the size of a tall regular brew... but the Machiatto that I got hear was only a little bigger than a shot glass. I was surprised by the size of it, but alright, after looking up pictures of other Machiattos, I now have been reassured that this is what a standard serving of the drink looks like. But I'm glad I tried it, it's an acquired taste.
And for a dessert I had if I remember a Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake which had the right combination of flavors that went well with the Machiatto. But then our chat started taking on a interesting turn as we stared talking about cultures of different civilizations so I wanted to get another cup of caffeine to go with the mood of our conversation. I just got a small latte which was what I was familiar with and after added a bit of sugar to it I was able to enjoy it.
All in all I'm just grateful that my friend and I came across this cafe while trying to find a place to get away from the cold. I wouldn't mind returning here again in the future."}
{"text":"I thought I saw \"Japanese street food\" on a blackboard stand outside this shop and instantly became curious. The place was cozy but bright with a giant fan above the front counter keeping the interior somewhat cool, and we were greeted immediately by a staff who offered us the menus. 

++
Sapporo breakfast: is this really what the people of Sapporo would eat for breakfast?? I've no idea, but I'm glad we picked this as our brunch. The scrambled egg was velvety smooth and tender just like we'd expect from at a Japanese eatery, and the sausages were flavourful and were a welcome relief from the well made but ultimately lacking rice balls, which were unflavoured. A small piece of, say, pickled plum would have brought the rice balls to life, IMO.

Banana hot chocolate: the banana flavour was on the subtle side which worked, and I enjoyed the froth on top.

Free wifi is always welcome, and interestingly this place lists the wifi name and code on the receipt."}
{"text":"This place is really unique, a must-try in Kensington Market. They serve brunch items and Japanese street food. You order at the counter and then find a table where they bring you your food. Inside, Looney Tunes and Betty Boop cartoons were playing on a large screen which made the vibe just really unique. There is also a little hidden back patio area.

The Tokyo Omelette was to die for - creamy, cheesy, fluffy and delicious. And served with a purple rice ball, I was satisfied after eating it but not stuffed. The Market Breakfast Poutine is some next level gluttony and just so good; the coconut curry sauce is sweet, it's served with real cheese curds. Definitely a humongous portion on the poutine and it was really heavy. The Fuji Salad was also huge, although a large part of it is veggies obviously so it's good for 1 hungry person. I wish there would have been more smoked salmon on it because it was great. 

I'll definitely need to be back to try more of their menu items - this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've had the vanilla ice cream with half 24K GOLD. My friend had the matcha. 
The vanilla is a bit too sweet, however the matcha is very nice. 
I really enjoy the specialty of this gold+ice cream. But I believe it's only for once. 
The environment looks pretty cool, I'll definitely come back and try more food here."}
{"text":"Top notch coffee.  Had their tokyo omelette and it was pretty tasty.  Wifi is pretty fast and the ambience was very relaxing.  Definitely recommended if you're in the downtown area"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a drink. The place is pretty cool, playing a Charlie Chaplin movie on the side. Theres plenty of seating and even a small patio.

Got a berry smoothie. Very refreshing! It was sweet and fruity. Will try to be back to try the gelato next time! They had a lot of interesting sounding flavours."}
{"text":"One of the cutest hidden gems in Toronto. This Japanese inspired cafe serves memorable coffees and lattes--I've tried the Coconut Butter Coffee (so good, and apparently it digests the caffeine better so there's so crash) and the Banana Hot Chocolate (best hot chocolate I've ever had). Pink sakura latte and hazelnut popcorn fraps are also HIGHLY recommended.

They serve food as well like sushi. For a cafe, it's very spacious with wifi and outlets. They project cartoons on the wall too! I absolutely love it as it easily became one of my favourite cafes to work out of in the GTA."}
{"text":"Solid gelato from a friendly staffer, and a nice option with Dolce just up the block.
Better than Lab -321 in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Loved their decoration, simple but this place made me feel comfy and welcome. They were kind and nice to me, and the service is fast.
I love Chai Latte and it's something that have been really hard to find, but their Chai Latte is good, I liked! :)
It also got my attention for the different (and tasty) combinations that they have for drinks. I do recommend the Banana Hot Chocolate, so good!
Also, the snacks and sandwiches are tasty and the portions are big.
You should try it!"}
{"text":"This is a great cafe in the Kensington market area; Iove the black and white movie projections, melancholic but  lovely. The food is good, you have a variety to chose from, the music is not excessively loud and service is very good and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Solid nitro cold brew ($4 medium). 

Smooth, good quality coffee! Reasonable price for a good-sized cold brew (on tap!)."}
{"text":"Beautiful food presentation (5 star). 
Tried the Tokyo Omelette, which was good but had too much mayo and the potatoes were ok. I would opt for something different next time, maybe a sandwich?"}
{"text":"Went in 30 minutes ago, wanted to smash a bagel in my car while I headed home from work. Grabbed  a toasted bagel with cream cheese. Came out to $4.80. $1.99 was just to add cream cheese. When I took a bite of the bagel I realized they forgot the cream cheese.. but I was wrong, they just put so little cream cheese you can't taste it. Pissed off! I would have gone back but I was already half way home. NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"I had their maté lemon tea drink and thought it was pretty solid. I'm not a huge maté fan generally but I thought the flavor of it wasn't too overpowering, especially with a little honey to cut down the bitterness. They've also got nice fast wifi (with purchase) so if your'e in from out of town this is a good spot to take a break and plan your next move."}
{"text":"Cute little joint. Was needing a quick bite before work. Staff super friendly and efficient. Love the minimalist industrial decor of the place. 
I got a latte and an almond croissant. The latte was rich and rightly bitter. The croissant is a bit too sweet by itself, but was perfect with the latte."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot! Coconut butter coffee is my favourite here. But literally everything is amazing. From brunch to lunch to their tasty baked treats. It's nice and clean. Wifi is fast. Such a consistent vibe and the cartoons is a great touch. My favourite spot to pass by when I'm on my way through Kensington on the weekend. Love it :)"}
{"text":"I'm in love with EATIVE!!

Visual presentation is unbelievable. Gelato and sorbet made before your eyes with fresh fruit juice and liquid nitrogen! And the taste... the mango passionfruit one I had was so pure and refreshing, and the salted caramel with coconut was super creamy and delicious. I'm soooooooooo in love. You gotta try this!

This little gem located inside Kensington Market is only 2 weeks old! They were giving out samples to the people walking by their store... so the curious me went in to try and I was completely blown away ^^ Staff were friendly, welcoming and enthusiastic about their product! The flavour choices were very unique, makes me want to try everything lol.

Eative has been participating at a lot of big street festivals and they log down every special event with illustrations on the walls in the store... like a memory scrapbook. Pretty neat ^^

Advertised as dairy free, fat free, low calories, gluten free, nut free and with no preservatives... this is the place to be for your summer frozen treats! They also have a booth in CNE this year, be sure to check them out :D!"}
{"text":"Amazing employees at this wonderful cafe.  I am sitting with two of them at the Old Spaghetti Factory.  They are making me type this.  Just kidding, Mami and Hailey! Your cafe is very nice!  It is always busy for a reason!"}
{"text":"I ordered a medium americano and a slice of cheesecake.  The guy at the counter was friendly but the coffee wasn't good at all - definitely not worth the price.  The cheesecake was ok but I would probably have enjoyed it better if the spoon they gave me wasn't plastic."}
{"text":"Nice corner cafe in Kensington market.  The strawberry mocha is rich with a hint of strawberry.  The takoyaki is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The staff are friendly and they'll bring you a cup of water with your order, if you order to stay."}
{"text":"What an unfortunate event. I thought Kensington could do no wrong but alas: Film. The food was very mediocre. The sandwiches were thinly filled with less than impressive ingredients, accompanied by a 'salad' (4 sprigs of greens) and what tasted like Hidden Valley Italian Dressing."}
{"text":"Great location, cool name, but that's where it ends...Overpriced and over-rated. Their Japanese 'street food' is way overpriced, service is done via number system where you pay and order at the front counter and are given a number that you take with you to your table. They have a very limited alcoholic beverage menu and a limited hot food menu. I did like the Sapporo on tap and the Japanese curry poutine, but other than those two items, the Octopus balls and Tokyo omelette were way too expensive and not exactly the best things I have eaten in my life. Would I come back here? Probably not."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared food. Nitro brewed cold coffee. Tried omelette and croissant sandwich. Delicious. Omelette rolled up and served like a sushi roll. Nitro brew is refreshing cold kickstart to a steamy summer am in TO. Order at counter, food is brought to you. Service is fast, and the premises are clean. Lots of seating with a nice patio in back with plenty of shade in the morning hours.

Update: second time here. Disappointed they ran out croissants but that was ok with us. Decided to try their upside down bagel sandwich and classic omelette were very good. Fresh and well prepared. The berry sensation and the bloody orange smoothies are refreshing. We'll definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, I'm still irritated.
I paid $8 for a small mocha with the banana purée they offer which sounded great
I got it half sweet, also asked for double shot of espresso 
I ordered with the barista 
The drink came and although it had a pretty heart on it and I really was shocked that I tasted no coffee, no essence of espresso, just basically a hot chocolate 
The cashier was someone different now
when I politely mentioned the mistake and asked if maybe they forgot to put in the espresso (which happens a lot -- I worked at Starbucks )they kind of ignored me and tried to tell me you can't taste it with the banana which is nuts because I'm an an avid coffee drinker of all types and i know a small latte based beverage with a double shot coffee should be tasted.
I told him I had it half sweet so I knew it wasn't the sweetness hiding the coffee then he said you couldn't get it half sweet which I laughed that he would say such a weird thing, simply less chocolate seems obvious 
The barista didn't get involved just confirmed he did put in the shots and they dismissed my concern flat out 
The problem was the drink wasn't right and then I suggested for them maybe they could just add another shot to fix this flavour at least not to mention the caffeine I really needed
The barista then argumentatively said you have to pay 
Just to be clear I was not trying to get anything free but knew I was drinking a hot chocolate and not a coffee
Seriously lacking customer service here and there's tons of other places to go to in the area and I felt robbed and brushed off.
I told him that's ok I'll just never come back.
I was the customer and I was walking on eggshells to spare their feelings about their lousy drink only to have no recovery and they had already taken my money.
This money is hard earned and the disregard blows my mind.
I threw out the damn \"coffee\" a block later.
And the funniest part is I work in film and we were shooting today on college st and it's pretty hilarious that I could return to a film set and tell everyone don't go to Film Cafe. So enjoy the results you make with the terrible impression you put on me.
Really too bad since this is what I got for skipping Tim Horton's and supporting local.
Bullshit experience. I shoulda bought a taco across the street instead."}
{"text":"This place is real good for working. Nice sturdy tables in reasonable sizes, not outstanding but good coffee, amazing desserts and clean bathroom! It can get busy during lunch time, but normally it's moderately crowded."}
{"text":"Eative Film Cafe started out as a small gelato spot about the size of a food stand on Augusta Ave. After closing down for a brief period, they've reincarnated as a café and eatery that occupies the space next door which spans the southwest corner of Augusta & Nassau. The emphasis here is on breakfast and lunch bites, coffee, fresh juices and smoothies, and of course, ice cream.

As soon as you walk in, you feel the spaciousness right away. There is a mixture of comfy seating which includes an outdoor patio, bar stool seating, and tables with chairs. The staff here are passionate and dedicated to their craft. 

Nothing on the menu seems to be too pricy, which is a bonus. I was feeling for a beverage and tried the Fruit Passion smoothie, which was blended perfectly and tasted great. Having sampled their hydrogen-infused gelato in the past, I was already a fan, but after visiting the newly renovated location I think I'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Had to check out Eative Film Cafe after seeing all the posts about the 24k Gold Ice Cream! Not only is the presentation of the ice cream wonderful but so is the taste. A little spoiler alert for those who haven't tried it yet, the 24k Gold has no taste. I ordered it in vanilla, fully covered in gold, which was a bit pricey but for the worth it for the experience. The vanilla ice cream is top quality, very sweet and creamy, some of the best I've ever had!  The menu has so many unique drinks, I will definitely come back for the Hazelnut Popcorn Frap. Super cozy and a lot of seating inside. The wifi code and bathroom code is on the receipt which I thought was super neat!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an \"instagrammable\" cup of coffee, you've found it! They have a screen-printer for the foam on your cappuccino and it's amazing!! Also ordered a breakfast croissant which was exactly as expected, delicious."}
{"text":"Eative is a cr-EATIVE (haha see what I did there) frozen dessert store that serves an incredible sorbet and ice cream. Made with super fancy liquid nitrogen, the eative brand and taste make me crave the smooth, delicious treats on hot days. Would definitely recommend people to try them out at their downtown location, or their vendor booths (currently front street foods exhibit). The staff are very friendly and always look hard at work. 

I had the peach mango sorbet which was extremely refreshing. The paired flavours balance each other really well. Definitely vouch for getting paired flavours rather than the single flavours. 

Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese style breakfast I have had. Loved the presentation on the okonomiyaki. Very delicious smoothies as well."}
{"text":"$5 for a large Americano?? Are you guys serious? That's more than Jimmy's, Capital, Sam James... you know you're just adding water to a double espresso, right?

Breakfast sandwiches come with more mayo than your grandma's egg salad sandwiches. Ambiance is good, space is nice and large, but if you can't figure out your coffee prices then you're lost, amigos."}
{"text":"If you want a low price, basic brunch, with no line, definitely come here. This is one of my GO TO brunch places! I was here on a weekend around 10:30 and ordered the Kensington (eggs, toast, salad, home fries, and meat). You get a free coffee with it before 11AM. There was also NO line, unlike other brunch places in Toronto, and I could sit wherever I wanted!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop with lots of seating, a calming atmosphere, and reliable wifi. I had the strawberry rose tea and it was delicious. I'd return."}
{"text":"Fantastic, tasty food and coffee makes this a great location for brunch. Although it can get crowded it doesn't feel cramped. Service is friendly, although I found all the staff had limited English, so sometimes communicating wasn't the finest.
They only accept cash, debit or Visa, not Mastercard or Amex. So be prepared if you expect to pay by card."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this stuff!!!  Everytime I am in downtown I pass by and buy a minimum of 2 large. That is the minimum for me!  So yummy and nothing added to it . . . just juice and they freeze it up on the spot in 1 minute.  So cool and yummy :).  And i don't know what the calories are, but they have got to be pretty low because me pigging out on their delicious stuff does not at all hurt my abs lol"}
{"text":"I ordered a chocolate cookie cupcake and omelette run today.  The cupcake tastes just like any other standard processed-food cupcake you find in a grocery store, the whole cake has no other flavor in it beside the bland sweetness of refined sugar.  The omelette was okay, taste like something you would eat for survival rather than enjoyment.  To be honest l was quite disappointed given the high review l saw before going here."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give this place zero stars? The sign outdoors advertised the coconut butter coffee. I went inside and decided to try the salted almond chai latte. It was terrible tons of foam and the latte was extremely bland. I asked the cashier to change my order bc the latte was not good but the cashier refused and said,\"they don't remake drinks\" Is this the Canadian way? Individuals in the United States at coffee shops will accommodate their customers. So 1 star because I can't rate it zero stars. I wouldn't recommend this place. Canadians customer service is key!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! The cafe has an cool and relaxed atmosphere, and the bowls, grilled cheeses and the breakfast is just good - regardless of you like Japanese or not! :)"}
