{"text":"Love this place. The pork chops are to die for and other food is delicious. Ambience is great and so is the food and service. Totally recommend it.

Hidden, on Mississauga road, easy to miss."}
{"text":"Great place very elegant dining room, food was great and the staff was very attentive"}
{"text":"After our favourite \"special dining\" facility closed we decided to try Terrace on The Green for our 49 Anniversary dinner.
Amazing comes to mind.
French Onion soup,the best ever tasted.
Had the salmon and unlike many places it was not dried out but was succulent and very easy to separate. Served with broccoli, asparagus on a bed of wild rice.  Well worth the price.
My wife had the Chicken Supreme and it was delicious as well.
For dessert recommend the spice cake.
Atmosphere is low key and element, soft music means you are able to carry on a private conversation and not be overheard because you were trying to speak over the music.
Went on a Thursday, great welcome from staff and it was not that busy.  On the weekend would definitely recommend a reservation."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday last year and it did not disappoint! It was delicious and a great lounging experience and the ambiance was amazing. Only reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars is because getting into the parking lot is dangerous and parking is limited (very small)"}
{"text":"I was here for a wedding on a Sunday afternoon as a guest. I'm carefully trying to be objective here and selecting points that are reflective of the service at the venue, but not of planning from the party. 

The place is nice. Lots of greenery and an photo opportunities. It's basically a park with a house for the reception off to the side. 
The outdoor ceremony took place near the Gazebo and pictures all around there and the rock fountain waterfall. 

It was August and it was hot. There is no shade, and no trees to provide it. Just be weary of that. 

There is also a small rock garden area, and this field (don' t know who it belongs to) of strawberries (?) that extend from the parking lot until forever. Don't know who it belongs to but it was mighty cool. 

The cocktail reception is small, but seemed to fit the 150 people cozily. I would suggest, if you're planning to have your wedding here, to open up the reception room so that people can also use that space to sit, mingle and chat. 

The bar today was cash and carry. I think I frowned a little at the sign they made for the drinks. Hand written, in marker on a scrap paper. The least they could do was print it out. I found it unprofessional. 

The food here was almost perfect. The Split Pea soup was creamy but not heavy. Two choices of salad, and the mixed greens with sunflower was really food. We were disappointed with the rack of lamb (which btw the was a huge portion!) that was very medium rare (almost bloody inside) when lamb should be well done. Also some folks had it well done, some didn't. Really inconsistent. 

The Chocolate Mousse Cake that they chose for dessert was amazing. I couldn't stop eating it. The light fluffy mousse on top of a moist (but thin) cake part with fresh cream. It didn't take artificial or store bought at all. Thumbs up. 

I was not impressed with the servers. We only saw 3 the whole time, and they did clean/serve things in a timely manner, however, they had this disheveled look and absolutely no expression. 

Everyone had either steak or lamb, and no steak knives were given, and the knives they had there was dull. When we asked them for it, we had to call at them multiple times because they would look at me and ignore me. Eventually they did come around with the knives, but this type of thing should be ready at the table, or given out before the meal shows up. I had to ask my dad to cut my food for me, hah! 

I also did not like that when the bride and groom was giving their speech, they had to come to the FRONT of the head table and serve them the food. Either figure out how to do it before, or come from the back. Regardless, they should know better and not be up there when someone is speaking. It's just wrong. 

4 stars for food
2.5 for service
4 for the venue. 

Definitely a nice place to consider for your wedding. 

Oh yah, the bathrooms were nice and polished."}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect! The service is excellent, the chicken supreme and peppercorn steak are delicious. We also had the pumpkin pie for dessert, it was very good and not overly sweet. Great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary."}
{"text":"Horrible! The food was good but the small details like changing the cutlery between meals, providing customers with the wifi password and not caring about customer service. Too bad, so much potential"}
{"text":"My wife and I scheduled a wedding date in 2015 for a date in September 2016. We had sat with the owner (Alex) on two occasions to establish our date, menu, room and price. Everything was written on his calendar notebook on the date of our wedding and on a paper he gave us with menu options. The owner and his assistant Rick said not worry and to come back 1 week before our wedding date to finalize the details. They never offered a tasting which was strange but  my wife and I were curious so we came back a couple of months later to try the food. On that date we reminded the owner about our contract. I called couple of times afterwards and never did get the contract. We thought thought it was strange so we went back 6 weeks before our wedding date to ensure everything was ok. We sat with Rick and he said everything was ok and spent 2 hours finalizing the event. We were all excited everything was going as planned. But then the next day the worst happened. the owner (Alex) called me yelling and insulting me with names I don't wish to repeat saying that he never agreed to our conditions. He tried to negotiate price with me again over the phone but i was skeptical due to the last minute changes and his behavior. That coming Saturday I returned to the restaurant to discuss the situation and showing him the papers and what he wrote on his notebook (I took a pic of his notebook and have the papers as evidence) but he refused to respect his agreement and pretty much escaladed the price by 1200. I refused due to the increase and his rude manner. Trying to get my deposit was a struggle. He even wrote me an incorrect check. I will never forget this moment as it was disrespectful and shocked my wife for life. I will never do business with Terrace on the Green or recommend anyone to this location."}
{"text":"Went for my sister's birthday. The place is nice, I like that the tables are nicely spread out and the chairs were actually comfortable. Wine is on the more expensive side but they have a good selection. The table bread is only okay but the pickled peppers are delicious. 

So to the good part, for main course I ordered the sea bass with scallops. My sister ordered the fish special, husband the halibut and my mother the filet. My dish was perfect. Classic combinations but cooked to perfection. The scallops were large and glistening and same with the sea bass. The vegetables were also good. I was impressed! The sauce with the halibut dish is delicious, I felt it wasn't cooked as well as mine but also very good. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and they all looked great.  

At the end my sister ordered a specialty coffee which I also got to try; lucky me! It was also delicious and a generous size. So all around it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO EAT?

If you're a fan of rib eye steak, I'd recommend the rib eye steak. We ordered a couple items and they were all done well. Rib eye stood out the most for me because I'm a fan of rib eye steak already, but at 14 ounces, the steak was grilled to the way I like it - medium rare. See my pictures to see what other entrees you might want to try! All were done to our liking and we enjoyed our meal very much! 

LAST TIPS:

The appetizers are good sizes and they offer a variety of appetizers (2 full pages!) so pick and choose to  share some apps instead of ordering one per person since it will be a lot of food if you order main and dessert too! You don't want to dread your food by the end of it...enjoy it!"}
