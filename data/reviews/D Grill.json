{"text":"I love eating here.  Food portions are more than generous and the taste is delicious! Conveniently located downtown at the \"D\" Casino."}
{"text":"The wife and I really enjoyed the restaurant.  The furnishings reminds me of a 60's dinner but the decor gives it a modern feel.  The set up is spacious, I didn't feel crowded at all.   I had the Southwest Chicken Salad and my wife had the Chicken Fruit Salad,  both were very tasty and filling.  Good price also.  We will definitely eat here on our next stay at The D."}
{"text":"The hubs and I stopped in here for dinner before seeing a show at The D. The decor was really nice (we loved how the new owners of the property renovated the old Fitzgerald's), yet I noticed at least a weeks worth of dust atop the lighting fixtures and the ledge above the table. This is the desert, so they should be dusting every 2 days, if not every day. And it also gets me to wondering about the cleanliness of the kitchen....  My husband ordered the shrimp pasta dish. He said was pretty good - average. I ordered a stuffed chicken breast with polenta cakes. My dish arrived with mashed potatoes instead of polenta. I questioned the waiter about it and he went to find out. He returned saying that the chef had changed the menu and the new changes didn't yet appear on the printed menus. So wondering if changes were made, why were the wait staff not informed about it? The chicken was also dry.   The up side to this cafe is the staff and the decor. Food can be had better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Now that my office is within walking distance of downtown, I could feasibly tackle every casino on Fremont St, although I'm not sure that's entirely necessary.  Triple George was certainly worth the review, but I've questioned the burger worthy choices of everywhere else. Binion's Café has also come up in the past few weeks, but that will be saved for another week. The D Las Vegas opened fairly recently, along with its D Grill, which several people have mentioned for its burger. I was skeptical, but once it comes up in conversation I must educate myself on any requested burger in town so off I went.  The D Las Vegas took over and rebranded the Fitzgerald's Casino & Hotel last year, giving the interior and exterior a much needed refresh. Being a Fremont St location, no matter what you do the shady crowd and smoky interior will persist. Without the help of poor signage I found my way to the D Grill tucked in the back of the second floor of gaming. Half of the space is flanked with tall banquettes and diner style tables and chairs, with some back lit walls. It's pretty large, and overall looks pretty decent. It was a little smoky despite the fact that no one is allowed to smoke in there, and you even get the faint sound of slots in the background. Their menu, which can't be found online, has over 75 breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert items which I can't recall because I only looked at the burger offerings.  After some deliberation I went with the wild mushroom cheese burger: sautéed wild mushrooms, garlic aioli, and asiago cheese on a challah bun. The meat had a really fresh beefy flavor, but it was totally overcooked beyond the medium-rare I ordered and had no char flavor. There was great garlic flavor mixed with the mushrooms because of the aioli, but not much flavor to the mushrooms themselves. The cheese was melted well but not all that flavorful or good. The bun was nice, but a bit too dry and cut poorly so it was too thin on bottom and too thick on top. I think the chef attempted to grill the bun because I noticed some grill marks at the very edges, but the center was apparently not in contact with the grill as I got bites of almost raw butter in some spots. The lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle were all fresh, but didn't make up for the rest of the problems. Overall it had all the elements to make a somewhat decent burger, but didn't really achieve it.  The fries were very generic; cooked well but had no great flavor to speak of. Also I received a really small portion, smaller than the other two helpings at my table for some reason. I understand that Fremont St is somewhat of a tourist trap, but this is where you should be able to still get decent deals. At $10.49 I can't really condone purchasing this burger, especially when you can go around the corner to get Triple George's burger for $2 more and far better quality."}
{"text":"My wife let me try a bite of her Filet Mignon. It was melt in your mouth goodness. I had the California Chicken Club which was good but not special. Our server had quite the personality. Try the vintage slots on the way in."}
{"text":"Just got back from staying at The D. While I love what the new owner has done with the place. Whoever he hired to set up and staff the D grill really dropped the ball. Took twenty minutes to get seated in what we found out was a half empty restaurant. We were told that we had to wait so that our server could prepare for us. Well.... He should have prepared better. Long story short. 6 people walked out."}
{"text":"The manager would not even show him self. Do not eat there the steak is hard and over priced."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a little over a week ago, about a week after the re-opening. It was a decent experience.  Menu wasn't crazy big, but enough to find something to my liking.   Bottom line, it was a burger.  What's not to like?  Could have used some more fries though.  Service could have been better, but I'll assume that they were still getting the kinks out."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the grill with a friend right now. Fucking terrible. Unripe tomato uncooked bacon on a blt. That's the B and the T. Literally, slices of ham instead of bacon and green tomato. Sending back the food once is my limit. If this cook worked in a shoe store, I'd probably have to explain what a foot is. What a disgrace."}
{"text":"This place is  a absolute waste of space. Have had numerous bad experiences. The food is subpar at best but the front desk service at the restaurant is my biggest tiff. I absolutely love the D as a hotel. It is a shining light in the midst of the freemont experience.      The D grill does not cater to hotel guests. No room service option,only call in. To which they promise a call back...never got that the 3 times i ordered during my stay. 2 of those times I called down and they confirmed my order was ready and waiting? What???    One night the hamburger was a soggy mess by the time i got it by the time I got it back to my room. The next day our group dined in... server in training... nothing was right. They did make it up to me by removing one of the entrees rom my bill. The next day I ordered breakfast. Completely jacked up my order and the front desk said I was hurting revenue because I wanted to cancel my breakfast. What kind of ridiculous customer service is that???    Im a sucker for giving this place any buisness. Gave them chance after chance only because it was inside the D and was convenient. I will happily take my buisness elsewhere. You can take your \"waisted revenue\" and politely shove it in the trash where your food belongs."}
{"text":"I came to the D to get my fill of meat. I left fully satisfied with the D. The manager himself was glad to hear that I was fulfilled by the D. However, there was an unfortunate aftertaste with the D cheese fries."}
{"text":"I live in Vegas and get a lot of comps for this place. Every single time I eat here it is awful. Dry omelets, hash browns that taste like a dirty grill, sour meat (had to return meatballs and a steak on 2 occasions as it was rancid) and over priced bad coffee (4.00 a cup?)  On one occasion we ordered a \"Wild mushroom omelet\" and what came was a spinach and cheddar omelet with mushrooms. When we advised the waitress that the order was wrong, she said \"Well, you need to be more specific\". I guess this means we must list everything we don't want? Saying a \"wild mushroom omelet\" must mean we want spinach and cheese??  The chairs here are a nightmare, scraping against the floor like nails on a chalkboard. A trip to home depot for some pads to place under these horrible chairs would do this place good.  I will donate these comps going forward. The D needs to dump this place and put in an affordable place that serves good food. I am surprised the health department hasn't paid them a visit to check on the rancid meat.  Run, don't walk away"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed.  The 'old' d restaurant may have been a little old and run down, but my experience there was always with friendly and competent workers.  We needed just a little snack to take back to our room, so ordered the chicken tenders--once we got to place our order that is.  We walked up to a counter with three people working, no smiles, no immediate help, then we were told to wait bc 'someone' would be coming to take our order (note, the restaurant was very empty as this was during a non-meal time). That didn't happen and eventually one of them took it.....begrudgingly.  We got our food in a decent amount of time, but one look and it's a good thing these didnt take long!--warning, these are definitely just a snack, not a meal....four thin little tenders....I paid extra for a third (buffalo) sauce and the container was significantly less than half full----not that that ended up mattering since there was so little chicken.  We paid for the $10 snack, plus the service fee and gratuity that is apparently added to every to-go order...for subpar service, it's hard to feel good about paying that.  As we waited, we watched them give the same poor service to other customers, including someone who called and was put on hold.....and remained on hold until someone i can only guess was a manager came up, noticed it, and took care if the caller herself.  Friendliness matters, mr. D, and it was not there today.  Next time, we will go back to our old reliable standby of Binion's Cafe--always friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice; first time for launch and the second time for brunch. We were happy with our meal and the environment, and we hopefully return for a dinner some time later."}
{"text":"Excellent place for good size portions of breakfast, lunch or dinner and the food was fresh and delicious. Richard our server was on it and very attentive and courteous. 2 people recommended the French Toast meal for breakfast and it was huge and sweet but delicious! And I had a simple 2 egg breakfast and my poached eggs were perfectly cooked and it came with a great big side of hashbrowns! The coffee was outstanding too! Great place for dining inside a casino!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on the morning we were checking out of the hotel, and it was good. It's your standard \"Denny's style\" restaurant with the standard menu items to eat. The wait staff was cordial and prompt, no complaints there. Generally, not overly special or remarkable, but it's good if your hungry and just want to have a meal. There's not a bar in the restaurant, but they can send a bar server to your table and bring you a drink. You have to pay for the drinks separately because of this, but I would still recommend if you're looking for a bite."}
{"text":"The grill is well worth it. The pricing is reasonable and the portions are huge. The service is great. Weather it be the one waiting or the busser, they all are very attentive. I love the island part of the menu and I highly recommend the loco moco."}
{"text":"Oh seriously, dont.  While the ambiance is fine [they really must have had a designer on board here] the food is so on par with Denny's that you should just go to Denny's at half (or 1/3) the price if you like that sort of thing.  The coffee is weak and full of cereal filler: dont.  The toast/english muffin is coated in some type of trans fat: dont.   The omelets look good, but must be made from the cheapest ingredients because they taste more like cardboard: dont.  The soup is straight from a 5 gallon plastic bucket: dont.  The hash browns are limp, soggy, and bland: dont. Yeah, like I said, seriously: just dont.   I'm trying to be funny about it, but there is just not one thing funny to be said about eating here.    ha  ha"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice and clean. A modern feel dinner but sadly the food was just to nasty to ever go back"}
{"text":"Worst eggs ever. They didn't taste like they were real eggs. The sausage was nasty too. Very disappointed in this breakfast. Not worth the $12 I paid for it. Just terrible."}
{"text":"Service here sucks. Stood in front waiting for a table in an almost empty restaurant for 5 minutes. All while the cashier is just staring at us. She finally decides to seat us. Then we wait another 10 minutes waiting for drinks, before we decided to leave. ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"We tried out this resturant for breakfast, our service was extremely slow. Looked like it was just our waiter that was slow, everyone else seemed to get prompt service. It took our waiter Andy about 20min to come over and ask what we wanted to drink yet alone take our order. The food is average, the silverware dirty! We got our check to pay and lo and behold there was a line to pay!! That took another 10 min. The reason we decided to eat at this place to begin with was the 5 dollar off coupon we recieved. Let me tell you it's going to take more than 5 dollars off to get me back into this place. Stay away!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is mediocre. My aunt and I ordered a Caesar salad. Both of our chicken breasts were still raw in the middle. We took off the chicken to eat just the salad but it was soaked in a weird caesar dressing that I've never tasted before. Every other bite also had something like sand in it that cracked your teeth. I hate being rude so I didnt say anything but don't order the Caesar if you go there. Also pretty spendy with not a lot of food items to pick from. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on 1/12/2013, they said they have been open less than 3 weeks.  I ordered an omelette and coffee, the food was really good!  Coffee was good too, and refills came promptly.  No problems with the service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere seemed great. The staff was amazing. The food was sub par. 5 out of 6 people in party were very unhappy with quality of food. Manager took care of our bill and was great but food left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Very friendly workers, yummy nachos! I recommend that you try it while you're at The D!"}
{"text":"Great service. We ordered from our room for dine in. They took our order although we were made aware that this was an exception. Once we made it down we were quickly acknowledged and seated less than 10 our food was served. The ambiance was nice and clean.  Steak and eggs and country boy hit the spot. Good portions!"}
{"text":"This is really more a 3.5 owing more to the service than to the food.  We went there for an impromptu dinner with a group of six.  We were pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the menu and the overall quality of the dishes and appetizers available.  The artichoke dip appetizer was excellent and good compared to how it has been at a number of other restaurants.  The clam chowder was very good as well.  I had the steak sandwich and this was well made, seasoned and made from good ingredients.  I had a chance to try the mahi mahi that another member of the group ordered as well.  The fish was well cooked, properly seasoned.  Overall the menu pricing was very fair for the quality of food served.  The service was very slow and it took a long time to get refills on water glasses.  Our server spilled water near one of the members of the group and made a half-hearted cleanup effort.  Maybe it was just a bad day for the server or an off-night, but that was our experience.  To order a hard liquor drink one has to have the casino cocktail waitress come in to the restaurant which makes for a largely inefficient process.  This is no fault of the staff, but more of a liquor license issue I would imagine."}
{"text":"I just wanted to grab food and take it to the room. We asked if they had take out, the host said yes. Then she said we still have to seat you...... (well I guess). A waiter then came to our table and asked what we would like to drink. We said we wanted to order take out. He said oh ok hold on. Then another waiter came, took our order and said ON ORDERS TO GO WE AUTOMATICALLY ADD TIP?? My boyfriend  said for what, you haven't served us!? THE NERVE, WHAT HAPPENED  TO WORKING FOR A TIP? As for the food, the wings SUCKED but my sandwich was ok."}
{"text":"Ordered french toast and eggs benedict. I never had eggs benedict so I went here to give it a try, not a fan of the dish, but the dish looked nice. French toast was very good but I didn't like how the syrup container was sticky and messy. Other than that the service was pretty quick and professional. The layout of the restaurant is a bit weird because I was expecting a bar area to sit in rather than in a booth but they don't have a bar which makes the restaurant feel a bit awkward. Other than the missing bar the restaurant looked nice. Payed almost $25 for both dishes and coffee so it is a bit on the expensive side of things for my wallet's taste so I may not come back."}
{"text":"There were no wait times both times we ate here. The first time I ordered the turkey club with French fries. The fries were average, but I did enjoy the turkey club. Mother and husband ordered the brisket, mom thought it tasted like pork and beans, but husband like it a little more. The appetizer, popcorn shrimp, tasted like cleaning spray. The next time we went, my mother and I got wings which were okay. Stepdad and husband got the steak, which they said was decent. I did get the brownie dessert and I thought it was delicious. Made up for the rest of the food :) Overall, I would give the food 2 stars because the price does not match the quality at all. However, our server, Rhonda, was very kind and patient with us, so I give this place an extra star."}
{"text":"I ordered their special, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, and 2 eggs for $9.99, and a coffee $3.  We stayed the first night at the D and crawled here for breakfast the next morning. It's on the second level from the casino floor, just take the escalators up to the Vintage slots area and head towards the back, past the Sigma Derby.  The service was very prompt, and the bussers came and refilled everyone's water glasses and coffee constantly.   We probably only waited less than 10 minutes before our food arrived, pipping hot and visually appealing.  The pancakes are the fluffiest, moist pancakes I've had! They came with real, whipped butter, that was quickly absorbed into these spongy hot cakes. The syrup glided down their golden edges. The eggs were also moist and airy, and I could have used two more pieces of the crispy, grease-less, medium in thickness bacon.   Others in our group ordered the Country fried chicken, a Western Omelet, and Eggs and Potatoes - everyone was in agreement that this fit the bill. The hash browns were wide shaved potatoes packed together and lightly fried on the grill.  There was something comforting about the decor, like a modern-vintage vibe without the pretentiousness of being too hipster.   These and 3 coffees and an orange juice ($3.95) came out to be $57.51 before tip. Probably one of the cheapest meals we've had on this trip."}
{"text":"Good food, and very good prices for the location. Right on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Great stuffed French toast and Philly cheese steak. The portions and price point is worth the trek down to the D hotel just for breakfast, lunch or dinner. So next time you are down Fremont street and really hungry stop in and get food. Ambiance is casual but still classy but not border lining on trendy. And wait staff is courtesy and helpful about making recommendations. You can actually tell they have their favorites and have actually ordered and eaten the food at the establishment they work at which is nice to know that they are not just pushing specials."}
{"text":"Had the frech toast and it was ok. I also  had the eggs and the harsh brown.  Not the best breakfast in town but decent if you want something quick or besides Dennis."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast lunch and dinner here at least 10 times over the last month while staying at the D.   The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. I'm a big fan of the Reuben and the demolition burger.  If you're in the neighborhood give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"This modern diner offers the usual assortment of favorites. Convenient if you're staying in The D Hotel and need a quick bite. Good service, tasty food, maybe a dollar or two too much for what it is."}
{"text":"Food Allergies? Avoid at all cost, no substitutions for allergies, servers don't care, manager didn't seem too sympathetic. Its 2014, research is out, a large amount of people have food allergies, catering to all is what makes a restaurant dynamic and enjoyable for all. Many restaurants are already on this path to alternate options for those suffering from severe food allergies such as celiac disease,  gluten intolerance. I understand they don't have options, but the fact the employees careless is what earned them a 1 star."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner since we are staying at The D. I looked at their menu and were very limited on the food items. I decided to get the chicken fajita bowl with a Diet Coke. The bowl consisted of chicken with salsa, black beans, corn and white rice underneath. I also tasted cilantro and Chinese mustard. Pretty tasty. It was very filling. The waitress and waiters were super nice. They were good about refilling my Diet Coke. I definitely liked that. I was really thirsty and got my refill right away. A major plus in my book.   We were seated at a booth. This restaurant is located on the second floor of The D. Easy to find. I definitely enjoyed my dining experience here. You can receive comps if you play in their casino. A cool way to save some money out of your pocket. It's good at the gift shop as well.   I would come back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The absolute worst meal in Vegas this trip.  I ordered the eggs Benny for $10.99. I asked that the whites be cooked. Waitress said\" of coarse, that's how they come\". Food arrive and eggs were almost raw and hash browns visibly burnt. I sent them back. Second time around the eggs were still poached but yolks had been both Brocken and now the eggs were both rock hard cooked and rubbery.  Now the has browns were almost raw and not cooked right through yet watery right through.  The cook clearly doesn't care or has no cooking experience.  I left without eating or paying and went across the street.  If I could give no stars I would but this isn't an option.   PS. I'm staying at the D hotel where the restaurant is."}
{"text":"Nasty food and Rude people save you're money just a heads up the waitress sucked too. The manger was young like 20 and never once apologized they didn't care so whatever we're never coming back here"}
{"text":"Trying to get served is painful.....food is mediocre. The staff is nice but this is at least my fifth time here and molasses moves faster than the service here......its too bad, there are not decent options in The D casino for food during the day."}
{"text":"Just ate here for my first time. The food was HORRIBLE! The service was great though. Everything my wife and I ate tasted like it was put in the microwave or boiled in a bag like at a cafeteria."}
{"text":"Came to this place and we were pretty excited to try it out, we looked at the menu and my Beau and I decided to try out their fish and chips. We were very excited- I mean like really, super excited and we were really looking forward to digging in and chowing down. We decided to get the fish and chips and I have to say that I was pretty disappointed. We got 3 pieces of the smallest little fish filets, I kid you not, they were a tad bit bigger than chicken nuggets- I was not impressed. They were mediocre, I mean they were not super flavourful, definitely not the best that I've had and it was a lot of breading for such little pieces of fish. Their salad was okay, and I could care less for their cole slaw... Not my thing. All I have to say is that if you go, do not order the fish and chips- that is all. I don't think that I would go out of my way for this place, if ever. No hard feelings, just way below what I expected."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. The quality doesn't stack up against other diners I've been to. Their French onion soup was really really salty the night we went. The pancakes my husband ordered were ok, I've made better at home in all honesty."}
{"text":"FOOD:  Oily! Salty!  I got the Beef and Vegetable soup since I saw another yelper say the French onion was very salty. The soup I got was also very salty but I enjoyed it a little bit because it was basically beef stew and I like beef stew.   For my entrée I ordered the Mushroom sauce pasta. It was alright. Big portion. It was too oily and didn't have much taste. Not good leftover food either.   The garlic rolls at the beginning were the best part of my meal.   SERVICE:  Service was ehh but not entirely horrible. Our waitress was interesting. She didn't seem to really want to talk to us. She'd rush away right after she was done \"doing her job\" (taking our order, bringing us out entrées, etc). The only reason why I gave this place two stars instead of one is because the bus boy gave us really nice service! He'd always come refill our waters before they were empty and he was very polite and friendly. :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite here since it was right down the street from the Mob Museum. It's on the second floor of the D, right past the old school slow machines that still give out coins instead of those tickets. Really old school feeling to the place when you hear the slot machines dumping out coins and people walking around with buckets.  We tried the wings, California chicken club, and the classic Reuben. The food was actually very tasty. The wings are served on a bed of fries and the sandwiches come with a pickle. Only rated 4 stars since the alcohol selection is very limited here. I don't see why, it's Las Vegas, isn't there supposed to be a a full bar whenever you're inside a casino?"}
{"text":"Your basics are covered here. The food is good, the staff attentive, and not over priced."}
{"text":"Our go to place for breakfast!   Really great omelets and other breakfast dishes.   Waiting very little time for table and was served in a very timely manner.   Really appreciated our server  Deborah - she was very attentive  and really made a great impression.   Came back the next day and asked for her table and sad that she was off for the day.    The Manager Melissa was really sincere in making confirming that our time and breakfast meals were as we expected.   We informed her since we stay in the D  this will be were we will always enjoy a great meal.     Thank you D Grill staff !"}
{"text":"Three stars for adequate service and mixed results in the food quality department. My fish and chips were just what the doctor ordered and as good as most any other bar & grill offering of the same dish. My fiancé's philly cheese steak was absurdly bland for such a sandwich. Adding salt made it marginally palatable but it was pretty much a dud.  For a reasonably priced, average dining experience, it gets you fed and won't offend, but it is far from the best Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"Average at best, 2 eggs 2 bacon and 3 pancakes for $9.99. $3 for coffee, not very busy though. The waitress was a little less than professional as was the cashier. Not many great breakfast choices on the strip, this will work."}
{"text":"We ate here twice. Brunch and dinner. The service was fast and attentive, even when there was a 20 minutes wait list. If I come back to vegas soon, definitely we'll be back here."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant yesterday.  The atmosphere is pretty calm. Not loud. It's pretty dark the menu looked pretty good as a whole I ordered the 1/2 slab of rib.  The waiter was polite and had a good humor.  The food came out fast. The ribs were well seasoned. The sauce was good.  The mashed potatoes and veggies were also good.   We enjoyed it.  The only thing that bothered me was that it seemed like we were being rushed out.  They kept sending the bus boy over to collect plates and he was reaching over our plates. The waiter never came back to Check on us. Maybe he was busy.  Over all I would go again.  The food was good."}
{"text":"Slow service,  sat down  took 15 to get water the the waiter took another 10 min just to take our order. I had the Korean chicken, my wife  had the  Saimin,  over priced really small portions , the funny thing is that it was not even crowded  and the was running in circles  like he was slammed. . What a joke !! I'd rather eat at the California hotel Ono  grindz  and way better  service. Im writing this and and still  waiting on my waiter to check on is..."}
{"text":"We discovered a good one! Great prime rib, very tender and flavorful .. Awesome Oxtail soup ( head to head with California hotel version ).. Service was on point ( Angela ) Food came quick, very little wait time.. Worthy of a good yelp review.. We will be back because it was a good combination of everything. Nice, clean place.. Great service and food"}
{"text":"From detroit. Lived in vegas 7 years Brings back my taste buds memory. Always a good reminder. Love that place. Thank god for ds"}
{"text":"Worst place to eat!! Service is horrible waited for 22 minutes at the table before I Got up and asked a person who looked like a manager, I asked her who was our server. She went to the back and five minutes later a coffee/water server came by and quickly informed us that she was not the waiter and could get us drinks, (rude). Four minutes later a waiter came to the table. He quickly informed us that he wasn't our waiter, yet he was serving all the tables around us. Their prices are ridiculously high. I'm telling you this place is a nightmare. Oh, our food was not delivered to our table till 45 minutes after we were seated!!!"}
{"text":"Service is very spotty. We stay at the D when we visit Vegas (every 2 months) and eat here 4 or 5 times per visit due to our food being comped. If we were paying for it ourselves, we probably would not go. It is pretty pricey for what you get. So many better bargains and quality downtown. The good meals that we enjoyed their were, the bacon wrapped pork loin that they have taken off of the menu. Most of the breakfasts along with their homemade jams. Yum!!!  The steak dinner, The French Onion soup, but lacks consistency, and the spinach dip. The other downside, they offer only breakfast and lunch until 4pm.  No dinner meals whatsoever."}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise!  We took a chance and entered the newly remodeled D (formerly Fitzgeralds) Casino/Hotel.  Went to the 2nd floor and found this hidden gem.  Our hostess seated us and we were immediately attended to by Antonio for our drink orders.  Our server Lorie greeted us and took our orders.  We noticed how professional and personable the staff were.  The food came and we were equally impressed by the presentation, freshness, and taste of our food.  Word will spread about this new restaurant venue.   Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner one night and was treated very unprofessionally, by one of the servers. It was a taller Hispanic woman I believe named Gloria, I had trouble with my order and I asked to speak with a manager and she refused to allow me to speak to one, worst dining experience of my life, loved this place but will not come back now.."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times while staying at the hotel,  which I won't rate as high. Pretty awesome chicken and waffles.  Waitstaff is pretty good and very friendly.  Counter staff.....not so much."}
{"text":"Hot! This place is very warm if y sit anywhere towards the front, I feel bad for the girls tht work here because the lights are so warm. It wasn't a major problem though, the wait time was quick to sit down, we ordered the New York steaks, they took awhile to cook but man was it worth it. These were fat New York steaks that didn't need any sauce or added flavor, they were delicious and the vegetables and mashed potatoes it came with were amazing as well. The food got an A plus and the iced tea was great too. However there was a little tension detected between the waitress and the hostess. On more than one occasion while we were there there was a problem between the 2 girls at the front and the waitress. I don't like knowing if there's a problem between staff if there is one."}
{"text":"Tried the $14 prime rib special (technically $9 with the $5 off hotel coupon). Pretty good hefty size for the price, wasn't expecting better than OK quality given the price and so 'twas, but it was pretty good dipped in the au jus. With the scoop of real mashed taters, decent buttered roll and big steamed veggie pile it was a basic but good filling meal for the price.   Some other stuff on the menu looked real interesting like the Joe V sub. All in all the commitment to quality here seems to be a little higher than the usual 24 hour casino diner, yet the prices really aren't higher. No 5.99 feed trough specials or anything but a meal and drink won't cost much more than $17 or so regardless of what you order.   Good reliable convenience choice if you're staying at the hotel or somewhere else near Fremont."}
{"text":"We were checking out Freemont street on a Sunday night and found ourselves starving, and surprisingly unable to find a decent place to eat off of Freemont that wasn't a steakhouse or fast food. We saw an advertisement on the electronic billboard of the D Casino for the D Grill and decided to check it out. This place serves all three meals all day and looks like an old school diner. It was very quiet with lots of older clientele; it was actually a nice reprieve from the loud casino floor.   The menu is extensive and everyone in my group was pleased with their meal. Notable dishes were the ribs, corned beef hash, southwest salad, and meatball sub. Overall, our expectations were exceeded and the prices are reasonable and the portions are large. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the nicer restaurants in Downtown Vegas. This is located in The D Hotel. The menu here also accommodates for the peeps from Hawaii that frequent Downtown Vegas. Friendly and good service. The oxtail here isn't so bad and great for chilly winter night in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We are fans of this place.  It's remodeled so it is fresh and new too!   We have eaten at this place on several occasions within the past month and my only recommendation is the hostess station.  Either you stand and wait for a hostess, OR you are overwhelmed with all the employees standing there waiting for someone to walk in - and that is a little intimidating and overwhelming.  One person would be sufficient please.  Paul loves the aluminum seating.  I love the water-jetted silverware panel's backlit with lights; it is a brilliant, inexpensive way to add so much character to a wall in a restaurant.  Great job!  We brought a party of 5 into the place and everyone was very happy with the meal and service!  Congratulations D Grill!     A personal tip of ours would be to walk out on the balcony by the bar just outside the restaurant and overlook all the people walking down Fremont experience - it is a great spot to overlook Fremont.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The prime rib is not good. Not seasoned well. The service is decent but I barely started eating and the server brings the bill and never returned."}
{"text":"Food was bad, service was worse. But we found $500 on the floor below our table. We give it one star per hundo. Would not visit again."}
{"text":"So I visited Fremont St and stayed at The D. I went for food at The D Grill a few times while there as I didn't really know where else to go and was disappointed each time. One night, my food was bland and over cooked. The second time, I waited a long time for a menu and for my order to be taken. Once again, the food was bland. The last time, the waiter hit on me! It was very uncomfortable and yet again-bland food. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Super excellent prime rib for 14 bucks! Service fantastic ! Laura was excellent with above average attentiveness. Definitely worth the$$$"}
{"text":"Almost every casino has a casual diner-style restaurant, and the D is no exception, offering casual fare for breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the D Grill from 8AM-10PM daily. To be honest, I had no plans to eat at D Grill - but they give you a $5 off coupon when checking in, so I figured I'd give it a shot. And I'm glad I did.   I looked at the menu before going and the one thing that stood out to me was that they not only stressed the high quality of their burgers, they advertised where their burgers came from. I hadn't really heard of \"Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors\" before, which goes to show you just how bad of a foodie I am. The 3rd generation meat wholesaler rose to fame in the 90's when Mario Batali made them the primary meat provider to his restaurants. They are very well known for their chopped meats and burger blends, and provide Shake Shack with their own burger blend.   Of course, I found all of this out AFTER I ordered their burger ... I just figured if they were advertising it like it was some big deal, it either was worth the hype or 100% BS. It was totally worth the hype. I ordered a burger medium rare with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was REALLY good. I wish the bun matched the quality of the burger, and the fries were tasty, but standard diner fare. But the quality of that burger ... oh so good.   The D Grill is old-school Vegas, where the casinos ran their own restaurants rather than outsource to celebrity chefs or large franchises. You can get a hint of the quality of food at their main restaurant - Joe Vicari's - from some of the fare at the D Grill. Obviously, the meat quality will be high. And when I heard another patron rave about the meatball sub, the server said they use the same meatball recipe that the steakhouse uses.  Overall, The D Grill was a pleasant surprise. I would definitely come back here and get a burger again. In fact, this might be the best burger in the DTLV/Fremont area."}
{"text":"Outstanding place to eat.  I ate here several times and service was always timely.  Food choices were sufficient and prices acceptable.  It can get crowded when the place is full.  Unfortunately it's a small restaurant.  I understand there is limited space at its present location but if the set up inside was roomier the setting would be better."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Had egg and bacon breakfast.. Not bad .. Eggs were a little greasy as were the hash browns .. Service was very fast and friendly.. Hence three stars"}
{"text":"My partner and I both had disappointing meals, I ordered the chicken penne, it had absolutely no flavour and the chicken was so dry.. I didn't end up finishing it.  My partner had the steak and asked for it medium cooked, it came out extremely rare and he also couldn't finish it. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Really great Eggs Benedict, fluffy pancakes, and a stuffed French Toast that rivals the others in the neighborhood. This place is not the cheapest, but it is always consistent and the service is always friendly and quick. The hostesses are especially sweet, there isn't an air of fake to their guest service.  I recommend this place for breakfast on Fremont, and will report back with my views on lunch and dinner when I finally come here after noon."}
{"text":"Service was great  Food is very good for the price . Very Impressed  I would recommend to anybody ."}
{"text":"Another visit at the D Grill and it did not disappoint. The Full House omelette was really good. Ordered a biscuit instead of toast and it was the best biscuit I've ever had. It was crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle not to mention buttery. The club sandwich was very good as well (see pic). They definitely did not skimp on the turkey or bacon (at least 4 pieces of bacon). Down side the turkey was probably not fresh sliced. Delicious food and good service (aside from the micro managing manager). Although her standards were not unrealistic, she should not have communicated it in front of or in hearing range of customers."}
{"text":"When I heard about this place initially, I thought another casino cafe style restaurant that I probably would not even review, not to mention give 5 stars. I am pleased to say I was wrong and happy I was! Warning: We ordered half the menu, so this review may get lengthy.  A friend of my bf and I is a server here so we requested his section. To be honest, no matter where we've visited him while dining he has always been on his game when it comes to serving. So no surprise our service was extraordinary regardless of the fact that they were super busy. I also noticed the  many suits around simply observing, I could tell the big bosses were in town so everyone was making sure to impress.  The place itself its kind of hidden in the corner, but once you enter the place the decor is pretty cool. Forks, spoons, and knives shine on the wall. (see pic) and the lighting isn't too bright nor dim.  Ok on to the good stuff, THE FOOD. For an appetizer we went with the recommended spinach artichoke dip. THANK GOD someone stopped using applebees same ol same ol. I could taste this was home made and fresh. Honestly it reminded me of one I once made for Christmas, so of course I liked it! The chips come in 4 colors, and the white and red ones taste better than the green and black. I think one is made in house and one is bagged.  As usual, we both ordered 2 entrees. My boyfriend (who if you haven't yet added, he now has a YELP, Brent S) ordered the Loco Moco, and the pulled pork. I had a blue cheese bacon burger and a side of biscuits and gravy. (looks like they serve breakfast & lunch til 4pm). Once served we were asked what type of jelly we'd like for the toast. So happy we didn't skip this part. We actually raved so much about our first choice of raspberry jelly that they insisted on bringing out the other 2 for us to try. Strawberry and Peach. Honestly- Knott's Berry Farm should look out if these kids ever get in the jelly business. Bottom line, it was just plain GREAT.  My bf devoured his Loco Moco so fast that I did not even steal a bite. It came in a big bowl and looked awesome. I did manage to grab a bite of the pulled pork and it was delish! On the sweet side and not over or underly cooked. My burger was good as well. There was a lot of blue cheese but it was not that overwhelming stinky feet blue cheese so it balanced well. I went with the garlic parm fries over the regular. I would eat the biscuits and gravy on a weekly basis if I could. The biscuits tasted less than an hour old and the gravy also reminded me of my own. Really I think thats why this place got 5 stars. The food just reminded me of home. From the jellies, to the burger, to the onion soup that I ordered to go. You could tell this place (as of yet) IS NOT cutting corners at all. I really hope the succeed so they wont have to. I am looking forward to returning for dinner. I am actually regretting that I did not look at a dinner menu while there.  The manager came over and checked on us and mentioned in about a month they are also opening a Steakhouse. I overheard some of the Bigwigs talking about it as well. They said they are from Detroit, and that's what the D really stands for so if you visit this place you can pretend you knew. Your welcome, and enjoy.  PS I may have possibly mentioned to the bossman that I wanted to throw a UYE here. I mean maybe. :)"}
{"text":"I've never stepped foot into the D although I work right downtown and I pleasantly surprised of how nice it was inside. The D Grill has really good food at an affordable price. Our waiter was really nice but it took forever for our food to come out. Hopefully if I go again it won't take as long for the food to be served."}
{"text":"Worst food I've had yet on the strip. Prime rib was EXTRA DRY and the chicken Marsala was VERY salty. Caesar salad was the worst! Save your money and go to McDonald's downstairs. Their food reminded me of food you'd get on an airplane. Just nasty."}
{"text":"Great place to eat I'd you're visiting Downtown Las Vegas.  They serve the best veggie beef soup ever.  I love the hit sandwiches too!  Its a quiet and intimate setting which is nice!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered sandwiches. They were both very good and the fries were hot and fresh. Club and French dip. No complaints about the food or service. Ambiance isn't their strong point but it was fine."}
{"text":"Very clean little restraunt tucked away upstairs with the vintage slots.  Breakfast and lunch are the only meals we've eaten there. Menu is a little limited and pricey but a good variety. $4 coffee is a wee bit too much."}
{"text":"Had higher expectations. The Philly cheesesteak didn't even have peppers. The side of fries was very small. The breakfast looked awesome - big servings, too bad I didn't have that. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I had a food comp here so I decided to use it for lunch.  I ordered the pork chops... they were actually pretty good.  It came with vegetables and mash potatoes.  I also had a brownie sundae for dessert.  It was also pretty good.  I usually get a food comp from the D every month; so I will go again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I didnt even want to give this place a 1 star..we had terrible food . Very over priced. No taste to the food it was disgusting. We wont be back"}
{"text":"Breakfast isn't good. French toast is nothing special.. and a very basic eggs Benedict...  However we did give it another try for dinner prime rib was perfectly cooked but needed salt.. Loved the French dip.. Mashed potatoes we're the best part of the whole meal."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time I was pretty drunk ordered breakfast and it was ok. Service sucked the server went on break as soon as we got our food. Which took a long time.   So last night we were there again. So I ordered a French dip and my friend ordered a cheese burger with a fried egg. They asked how she wanted the burger and egg cooked. The food took 20 minutes to arrive. Then the server went on break and said if you need anything go to the hostess. Kinda rude. So my bf joined us and he ordered a cheese burger with a fried egg from the hostess and never got the option on how he wanted his cooked. My French dip was very fatty and chewy. The fries were cold. They wanted to charge me fifty cents for pickles. So I couldn't enjoy what I ordered because it was awful and had no flavor.  I got a cheese quesadilla which was burnt and the sour cream was watery and chunky. Don't waste your money here. The McDonald's would have been better and cheaper."}
{"text":"This place only gets an extra star because it's dirt cheap compared to most places in Vegas. I should take it away because they tried to make pot roast out of beef tri-tip. Tri-tip is way too lean to work in that application. I could barely eat two bites of it because of how dry and tough it was. The service was very awkward as well; it seemed like our waitress forgot to take her medication for social anxiety disorder.   The vegetables were cooked perfectly. Shame they didn't have any seasoning to put on them."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the D hotel at ALL - and the D grill is no exception. It took almost an hour after ordering just to get an order of nachos. And they were $18 freakin' dollars!  Servers almost seemed to intentionally ignore people.   The one good thing I can say is that the nachos were huge and they were generous with the toppings - I got the steak nachos and was pleasantly surprised but the amount of meat that was on them - but the chips didn't taste very fresh.   I know Vegas is generally expensive for everything but at these prices, I'm certain you could find better food."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and reasonably priced.  The customer service was through the roof amazing. Every bused and server were very attentive even if we weren't their table they checked on us and the overall look and atmosphere of the grill was very inviting and rustic.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"amazing food. really liked the soup and pasta. enjoy your meal there. and good enviourment but the waiter service is not that good but pretty good."}
{"text":"The diner has been nicely remodeled, the it's not to classy yet not to trashy. I really like The D hotel and how they have remodeled and yet still kept classic vegas. The meal we excellent the steak I ordered was prepared to order and to be honest was probably straight from the steakhouse behind it , maybe a shared kitchen? The sides were mash potatos & veggies, the steak was topped w blue cheese crumbles. Salad w dressing and dinner rolls were also included. The wait staff was very attentive and promptly refilled out drinks and brought bill on time. I like that you can use casino vouchers for meals here and also your player card points. The only thing I didn't like was there was no waiting area or paging system, so during busy times it's a mess hanging out in front of the diner."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich.  It was roast beef lunch meat on a bun with cheese melted on it.  So basically I paid $12.99 for a crappy lunch meat roast beef sandwich.  It was ok for a lunch meat sandwich but definitely not great and not a Philly cheese steak.   Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"D Grill isn't quite sure what it wants to be yet, and the staff is really just settling in.  Service was attentive, but they were slow to bring out my sirloin burger.  The name, and most of the menu implies an informal coffee shop, but the decor and somewhat pretentious service at times would make you think you were in a gourmet restaurant at a boutique hotel. With that said, I am certainly willing to give D Grill another chance, and the sirloin burger was A+, and was fairly priced at about $11.49."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. Had the country fried steak. Yum. Server Vlad was polite, prompt and fun. We had a great time."}
{"text":"So good! Try the portobello eggplant sandwich! Also, black bean veg burger or regular burgers are the bomb! Bread pudding  is delicious too! Good service, nice modern decor. Love it! Try it!"}
{"text":"The problem is being a female in Las Vegas who loves sparkles and has tattoos.. my husband ordered from the room and we waited to pick it up as we were told someone will call us once it's ready. And waited. Waited... after an entire show of Raymond we decided to call down to check.   Food was ready .. weird. Stupid us forgot the ID to charge to room so at the door husby went back up. Well,NOONE acknowledged me standing there..  since our key suddenly didn't work (glitch ) I couldn't produce my ID, ( yes my fault) so I informed the host (in training) that my ID is upstairs our key Doesnt work and by the time we'll get the key fixed, get ID and come back the food, well,  it will be cold.. I'll need to cancel and re order (after all 25 min wait on cold food was but not our fault the first round)  First thing, without letting me address the actual issue: \" no it's a loss of our revenue\" I started again.. my ID is upstairs the eh doesn't work. She: it will be a loss of our revenue!  I looked at her, grabbed my purse and left.   Customer service 1/1: find the problem , dissect it, offer solution .. Worse thing to do: BUT as first word if I ,the customer, has a problem   Oh.. btw the guy, yes MAN ,in front of me was not asked to provide ID to charge to room. Funny how that works    Tip: yes bring ID (took wrong purse) but, listen first and address the issue in the industry"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm surprised the overall rating is 3 stars.  I was at the D for an extended stay and this place was my go to for at least 1 meal a day. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner. I tried it for all 3 day parts and I enjoyed all of my meals and service was good.  I never did eat in although I peeked in the dining room and it felt nice and the decor was great.  I had just gotten done with surgery on my back so ordered everything for carry out. I had wished they did room service in my condition but once ready, they would buzz the room. My fave was \"the little three\" breakfast combo. I start drooling when I talk about the cinnamon roll pancakes. They are soooooo delicious. Another breakfast standout was \"The D\" omelet which was large and had a super awesome zip to it from the roasted jalapeños. Had 2 of the salads... Caesar and the Cobb stack. The latter was better of the two. Brisket sandwich was pretty great. Get extra peppercorn gravy on the side. Went awesome with the fries. Also really enjoyed the chicken fajita bowl which was filling, had great flavor and texture. The buff wings and french dip were my least favorite items but still good. For breakfast lunch and dinner, go go go"}
{"text":"Good service and great steak sandwich and meatball sandwich. This restaurant is tucked away on the 2nd floor of the D Hotel casino. Prices are very reasonable for being in a hotel. It's worth the walk and search down Fremont street to get to this place."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of returning here because they used to have a good chicken sandwich(that they removed from the menu). The hostess was rude when we arrived and we even witnessed her yelling at some guest for following her to a table(they made a honest mistake of thinking she told them to follow here back). This woman told them to go back to the front very rudely. That's no way to talk to people that are trying to dine at a restaurant that clearly has nothing special about it. Our server was no better. She couldn't answer any of our questions and had no hospitality manner about her. Her name was Rebecca so if you do dine here make sure not to have her serve you. She even tried to charge us for our water that we had to buy downstairs because their water was disgusting and had an unfiltered slimy taste. The food was alright, if you even have an appetite after dealing with these rude people. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome. Food and service was great. The servers really know their stuff. The buser refilled out water every 5 minutes. Also, unlike most places in Vegas this place was actually worth the $. Our family of 6 ate for less than a $100, AND it was the best meal during our trip. Don't hesitate to eat here, we had an amazing time. Stop by and you will too!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice look and lots of friendly wait staff but the food was very bland overpriced for the quality.  They only serve beer and wine and the beer is all cheap stuff like bud light and corona.  We ate here our first night at the hotel and decided not to eat here again.  I'd suggest going to Luna Rosa just across the street."}
{"text":"15 minute wait for a table, no problem. 15 minute wait in line to pay after eating, big problem.  Food was fine. The place is badly understaffed bordering on chaos."}
{"text":"My play earned me a $25 comp so used it here. Got the country benedict. Hash browns had chopped bacon in them. Bacon, I say! Fantastic food. They accept Bitcoin which is a huge deal to a crypto guy like myself (check my channel \"Becoming Superfly\" on YouTube. You can also play keno while you eat."}
{"text":"Very good place.  I got the burger with cheese,  bacon and fried egg.  I was not dissapointed.  They cooked it perfect to temp and the fries were very good as well.  I would say if you are downtown and want a burger, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The D Grill had a really hip atmosphere and complements the rest of the casino well.  However, one suggestion is that they brighten the lighting for breakfast.  The dining area is extremely clean.    My breakfast came out quickly after I ordered.  The service was efficient, just not friendly.  My omelet was on par with other breakfast places.   The omelet was reasonably priced.  However $4 for coffee is very expensive.  It was worse than the instant I sometimes drink, too.  A breakfast place should have coffee that is at least as good as Maxwell House."}
{"text":"Super Bowl 2017 my husband and I ate at this grill the first night we were here. Spinach and artichoke dip with naan was great. We decide to have breakfast here before we headed home. Big mistake. Long wait with tables available. The hostess was yelling out names for the next diner like she was on a school playground. And to off it off, the cook couldn't even scramble eggs."}
{"text":"I've been to the D Grill a few times, and while I wasn't blown away, it was a fine establishment and worth going to again.   First of all, it's hidden upstairs on the second floor with the vintage slots. This is a positive. You're secluded from the mass amount of people, and the casino noise doesn't creep in. You can listen to a nice selection of music from the 60's, 70's, and 80's while you eat. There are no TV's however, and originally being from Michigan, it's disappointing that I can't watch Detroit sports while I eat in a place that promotes itself as a place to watch Detroit sports. Only at the bar, I guess, and while they do have the Tigers games on when they play, it's no more than any other place in Vegas. Don't get too excited if you came to The D specifically for that. There are a couple of screens that feature Keno, with Keno cards at your table, if that's your thing.   I was seated promptly every time I went here. The seating capacity is bigger for downtown. If you have a large party, there isn't as much room. Lots of spaces for parties of 4 or less. The service is excellent. Like other places, you have 2 servers. One server will continuously bring you drinks/sodas and make sure your cup is always full, which I like. They serve Coke products, which I also like. The second server will take your order and bring your food, and also get you refills if you need them. The flip side of that is, you feel compelled to leave a larger tip because you're tipping two servers. It's a Vegas gimmick I could live without. Take advantage of those refills!  The servers are friendly and do a good job.   The food came quickly every time, which sounds nice, but it's hit or miss on how fresh and hot your food is when you get it. Only once out of 3 times my fries were hot and fresh. I'd rather they take their time and ensure my food is well cooked and prepared. The menu is pretty big with a lot to choose from, and the prices are reasonable for Vegas.   I wouldn't say I was blown away by The D Grill, but I like it, and whenever I'm downtown looking for a meal, I'll consider coming back to sample more of the menu. It's definitely better than some of the other places I've been to that are similar. Give The D Grill a try. You might like it."}
{"text":"Three stars. One star for my moms salad being descent, 2nd star, sisters meatloaf not too shabby and 3rd star, for my bacon n mash potatoes. Hash browns OLD N OILY!!"}
{"text":"Beer is good. The food was awful. Service was ok. Won't be coming again. The food that we ordered was not well cooked. I could see that the people next to us had the same problem. They had to get another pizza done because it was burned."}
{"text":"Visited cuz have a friend working in the D. Good food! And people there are professional! Price is slightly more expensive than other casino around, but in general acceptable! Modern environment, and had a great brunch with my family! So probably will go back again if I stay in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"This place is in Downtown Vegas. We only went for drinks. Definitely get an extra shot in your daiquiri, it's worth the extra charge."}
{"text":"For a Fremont Street Hotel Cafe...Yeah, pretty good. Had a deal from them since I was staying and glad i tried. Good food, good service, valuable as well. If I happen to stay there again, I will be going back."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us on July 1, we were seated at 5:54, we finally got up and walked out at 6:13 after being ignored. No one came by and asked for drinks, appetizer's. I guess they have enough business..  We ended up going to Binion's, I am so glad we did..."}
{"text":"My gf and I were looking for a place to eat and ended here. It was super compact with low ceiling, the menu was really simple. Ordered brisket with bbq sauce and Philly cheese steak. Someone eating next to me had the same thought and I saw him eating it and spit it back out. His wife tried some and same thing. I got worried, next thing you know our server comes and apologizes and ask if I wanted something else cause the brisket wasn't good. I was fine, I ordered a hamburger. We waited about 30 min for our food. We called the waitress over and said we will pay for our drinks and we're okay with the food. She said it's almost ready so we waited. We got the food and food tasted old... I almost felt bad for the servers that work here. Nice people but horrible food. On a good note, played the slots and made my money back I spent on food."}
{"text":"Have dined here before and the food is generally good.  However, do not - I repeat - do not order the meatloaf!  This had to be the worst food I have eaten anywhere in my life. Maybe an off night in the kitchen but how do you screw up meatloaf?"}
{"text":"Cafe recently had menu changes. I liked the quality of the food before the change. I think it's different owners or cooks. Then breakfast is okay. The usual eggs,bacon,potatoes, toast. The lunch is a little better I had a good brisket sandwich with good fries. I find it pricey for downtown. Good thing I have vouchers to cover the meal! My main issue is they don't serve breakfast after 12 noon. I mean c'mon it's Vegas after all. So if your not an early bird you will need to venture out to Fremont street to the other restaurants that serve breakfast all day and night. Oh, and they close at 10:00 p.m.  The cashiers and servers are hospitable and polite and have always had good service."}
{"text":"D-Grill Downtown Las Vegas Fremont Experience. Very quiet from the world outside.  Service and food is very good. Teriyaki beef with white rice and macaroni salad very good. Chicken Sandwich a little dry but good.   Enjoy your time here \" Now go back out and go crazy in Vegas \""}
{"text":"Food and service is good but everything is relative and for the prices you are paying here you can get so much more by traveling just a little bit. I had the Eggs Benedict which was good but the plate looked kind of small with sad with my barely cooked hash browns. If I would have seen that coffee was $4 i would have stayed away from it. Damn.  Our waitress Angela was super nice and kept  filling our water and coffee; asking if we needed anything else.   My daughter had a $10 burger but it was really good and my wife was very happy with her roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and ambiance . We came in at 1:30pm and was able get breakfast. The coffee was good.  Offered us a to go cup as we were getting ready to leave instead of us asking! They are extremely reasonable price wise."}
{"text":"Gone are the days when you could get a $1.99 egg, hash brown, and toast special.  That may have ended 5 years ago, but I stayed at The D and was given a $5 off coupon for The D Grill, so their $6.99 breakfast special was about $1.99 in comparison.  Unfortunately, the service (or lack thereof) killed the experience.  I was promptly seated but waited forever to order even though I knew what I wanted.  It's a tiny meal, so I finished quickly.  But I couldn't get my server's attention to get my check, which in my opinion should have already been dropped off as she saw me halfway done quickly after dropping the food off.  I had to go to an appointment so I just went up to the counter to pay.  I guess the server I had doesn't like tips.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! I had the crab cakes bennidict, it was awesome! Also, ask fir your hash browns extra crispy :-D"}
{"text":"There have been a lot of positive change to the D Hotel since Derek Stevens bought the property.  I never ate in what was the coffee shop/buffet before the renovation but it always looked like a sad, run down area.  Before the Las Vegas Great Santa Run, I came here for breakfast.  Note, they don't open until 8 and I was a little early and had to wait the five minutes to opening.  The interior is no longer a wide open space but has been changed into smaller areas that make dining more pleasurable and also cuts down on noise.  After being seated, I was promptly greeted by my server who brought water and then coffee I ordered.  I ordered the stuffed French toast which the menu describes as:  Two think slices of raspberry chocolate bread, soaked in a rich vanilla cinnamon custard, stuffed with sweet mascarpone cheese filling and served with warm maple syrup.  This was a large breakfast.  The mascarpone is flavored with raspberry also because it was a pink color.  There was some raspberry syrup drizzled over the slices and some powdered sugar.  The French toast was OK but it was a bit moist bordering on being soggy.  I did not use the syrup as I generally don't use maple syrup--real or phony.  The photo on the menu shows the toast decorated with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of mint.  Instead, there was a cup of butter and a sprig of parsley.  Service was good.  I was asked about a refill of my coffee.  Not a bad place and somewhere to try lunch sometime when I do Slotzilla!"}
{"text":"The D Grill is a solid spot for breakfast and sandwich items.  I tend to lean towards the omelets here although I've had almost everything on the menu.  Other solid choices include the French Dip and Pasta w/ Meatballs.    The service is good, but this place does get a little backed up.  Don't be surprised if you have to wait 30 mins for a table on Sat and Sun."}
{"text":"FRENCH DIP is to die for , there was a group of 8 of us and the service was second to none . French dip is outstanding as the beef is well cooked ( not to rare ) & the onion rings OMG.  Portion size is good and price is extremely reasonable"}
{"text":"Good bread cool service! The Sarah Palin look alike waitress on the night shift is super cool & the day shift is pretty cool too. Food gives me a ihop feel with better decor I would come here again but NOT stay at the D Hotel   The hotel itself is a whole diffrent story"}
{"text":"The good here is really good.  It does seem to be over-priced for a casino restaurant, though. The worst part is they do not provide room service. No room service. No room service. Additionally they seem to be understaffed. I only saw two waitresses."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in food.  Ate there twice and same results. Something with the meat they serve. Tasted like leftovers that had been microwaved. Service was great and getting seated was quick"}
{"text":"When you find out that a 3.5 star rated restaurant is serving a full Thanksgiving meal (including dessert) for $12.99 you should:  A) Be scared B) Say \"Yolo!\" C) Go for it!  The answer is C. A solid overall choice for Thanksgiving, and for a price that is unheard of on The Strip.  I ordered Prime Rib and am not sure what I was expecting, but t was actually quite good. Not top 5, but solid by any calculations. Husband had the turkey. He ate it all. The sides were also good, the mashed potatoes creamy, the stuffing similar to Mom's, the vegetables cooked well. They ran out of the advertised dessert, but graciously offered us other choices from the menu.  The decor at the D Grill is also a-ok. One can tell it has been recently updated and is immaculate and inviting. The service was good, particularly on such a busy night with so many large parties.   It was fun to see life outside the strip and we walked to Freemont Street and the Container Village (closed but fun to see) nearby afterward in a feeble attempt to burn off our meal. Hubs had read about the revitalization of downtown prior to our trip and it was wonderful to see!  We took a gamble (Get it? Ha ha!) and we're fans! I'd do it again and I'd recommend the D Grill to others too."}
{"text":"French toast?? Yes please!   I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the french toast is here! Usually with casino type cafe's (which this isn't I came to find out once coming in), the food is very subpar. But, I love the feel and ambiance of this restaurant. It is like a cafe but way nicer and more options of food. Bacon was okay and they actually had decent fruit as well. Price is pretty good but not the greatest either.  They are located inside The D Casino upstairs with the vintage slot machines. Server was funny and did his job. Can't complain!"}
{"text":"I am rating this place against other 24 hr cafes, that is why it gets four stars. It is one of the better diners in Vegas.  The appetizers were good. Mango relish on coconut shrimp was good, slaw was okay.  The sliders were good, lots of flavor.  The best thing about the meal were the crab cakes. Some of the best crab cakes I have had. Full of crab, no filler, good tasting crab.  The horseradish cream and jicama slaw they served with them were a great complement.  Definitely get the crab cakes.   The French onion soup was good.  Good broth and excellent onion flavor.  My father in law got the meatloaf, it wasn't good. The flavor was there, but the texture was horrible. I got the demolition burger. Good amounts of corned beef, they overlooked my burger, asked for medium served well. The burger as a whole was tasty and very big.  My wife got the salmon tostadas. She liked them a lot, the coleslaw that comes with it not so much.  She said the tortillas were very crispy and the salmon fresh."}
{"text":"Now for the most part, I enjoyed my stay at The D and would give them at least a 4 if it were not for the experience I had the day I left. Part of the reason I didn't complain, was that I was leaving that day and took my food from the grill to go. This last day I went some time later than usual, which ended up being around 9 or so and maybe they had different staff at that time.                                                                                                                                         Upon opening my to-go-box, I see a sorry excuse for eggs on there. Who orders eggs that almost look sunny side up, but with the yolks broken? I was going thru old camera shots and found a video of it from 2 years ago, but unfortunately I cannot upload it. Wish I took the time to complain sooner, but I'm sure or I would at least hope they know better now."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on a whim.  The staff was very professional and nice.  I even got to play Keno while eating my food.  I had the Crab Cake Benedict while my mum had the Chicken Quesadilla and my aunt the Steel Cut oatmeal.  We all loved our food!  My mum thought that there would be more in her quesadilla then just chicken and cheese but she still liked it.  The guy came to refill our coffee frequently and was very quiet.  It was funny b/c my mum and aunt were telling me to put my coffee cup down (I was staring at the Keno screen intently at the time) and I was like WHY DO I HAVE TO PUT MY COFFEE DOWN? Then they tell me the guy wants to refill my coffee and I was like...oh! and I turn around to find him with the coffee, LOL!  He was very nice.  The coffee was just right...not bitter or burnt:)  The prices aren't too bad either.  The chairs are kind of weird...all metal, but that's to go with the theme I suppose.  We would definitely come here again!  On another note The D also has this old fashioned horse racing game my mum loves:)  We only thought the MGM has it."}
{"text":"Definitely the best meal I ate in Vegas.  Great Value, good service, excellent prime rib.  we happened on it by chance, but glad we did."}
{"text":"We spent New Years weekend at the D and New Years day, after drinking all night , we wanted a good late breakfast/Lunch. My husband had the chicken strips and I had the Country Benedict. My hash browns were not greasy but they were undercooked and not at all Crispy and by the time I got them, they were also sort of cold. The country gravy and biscuit were really good, but not enough gravy , so kind of dry. The over easy eggs were undercooked ( whites still a little runny) and the portion of sausage, while generous, was also a little on the cold side, though the plate was really hot!   Service was really slow and while waiting for the meal we asked one of the servers for a refill on my cranberry juice and was informed sort of rudely that the refills are not free on juice...we were comped the meal, so I wasn't really concerned with that.   The chicken strips, crispy, but stringy and dry and not very good flavor. Even if we have comps, we won't eat there again. Totally not satisfied when there are so many other good choices available in the area."}
{"text":"A solid 3 stars. My boyfriend and I have recently started staying in downtown when we come to Vegas. This time we decided to stay at The D. Not going to lie, there was a coupon. We were here during Valentine's Day. We came here the day after Valentine's Day for breakfast. We were seated right away. Someone came and took our drink order right away. Richard was our server. He was very nice. There is a guy who was filling drinks but, it was tough getting refills. I ordered the steak and eggs cooked medium rare, well done hash browns, with 2 sunny side up eggs. My steak was cooked well. The egg was a bit overdone. My boyfriend got the filet Benedict. The hollandaise was good. The meat was tender. We enjoyed our food way more than we thought we were going to. My food also came with toast. Overall, it was pretty good. We did a lot on the 15th and stayed up really late. When we got up the next day, we got a late start and needed to get to the airport. We came back for lunch. It was technically \"breakfast\" but, they offered some lunch items. Same server and this time he seemed overwhelmed. It was pretty busy and there were only like 3 servers there. I ordered a burger with no bun, added an egg and bacon. Protein! Apparently the burgers don't come with a sauce. There is ketchup and mustard on the table. I got a side of thousand island. My boyfriend got the wings. I ate 2 of them. They were actually good. I gave him my fries. The burger was basic. Nothing amazing or memorable about it. Basically, the food is better than we anticipated, the server is nice but, it was too crazy. I'd come again but, with the many places to eat in Vegas. I'd go somewhere else first!"}
{"text":"Had the ramen noodle soup the first night and it was a little light on ramen.  The broth was very savory though.  The second day I had the French dip that had plenty of beef and au jus that wasn't too salty like a lot of other places."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast sandwich. It was extremely tasty and very filling. I couldn't even finish the entire plate l, not normal for me. It was the country fried steak sandwich, the only thing I would change would be the scrambled eggs I would have had them cooked over medium. The hash browns were okay, not great but not terrible either. So if you are staying at the hotel I recommend using your $5 off coupon and enjoying a meal. The restaurant was clean and the staff were very friendly. So go enjoy some food."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch few days ago.  Really terrible service. Very old tasting food very bland & tasteless  Would never come back that's for sure.   Popcorn shrimp tasted moldy  And was not fresh at all.  Buffalo wings tasted like they were refried from last night.  Literally nastiest meal I've ever had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stayed at the D for a little and ran into D Grill. To say the least, it isn't Dat bad.... but it isn't D greatest either.  Decently priced but service took a little while to come out with the food. Food was alright, but downtown has plenty of options for really good eats!   Ordered breakfast food with my friends and ordered the eggs Benedict. I'm not really picky, but the eggs benny was pretty decent. Just did not like the long wait that I experienced."}
{"text":"Okay, so I had just gotten into Vegas and checked into my room at the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino, and I wanted something to eat. As I got into the elevator to head down to the lobby, I rode down with one of the IT guys from The D Casino Hotel. So as we're walking he starts telling me about the D Grill, and how wonderful it is. I swear, this dude should be part of the PR marketing department and not in the technology side, because he really sold me on this place. He even went as far as to actually walk me there. Which was fine by me because after several hours of driving I was a little disoriented anyway.   So I get to the D Grill, put my name in, wait about 10 minutes, and get seated. I looked over the menu, and decided on the cinnamon roll pancakes with a side of bacon, coffee, and a glass of milk. As most frequent readers of my Yelp reviews no, I'm a big stickler for waitresses and waiters remembering my milk. The D Grill didn't disappoint in that aspect.   The inside of the D Grill itself was pretty dark, and the menus were a little hard to read, but that could be just because I'm getting old and I'm not like one of those hip youngsters that hangs out wearing their baseball cap backwards on Fremont Street. Service was courteous and speedy, and actually it did not take long for my meal to come out. So kudos for the service at this place.  So let's talk about the food. It was just okay. Not spectacular, not \"Oh my God, this meal changed my life\" good, just decent solid food. The waitress came by and refilled my water once, but I only had one cup of coffee during the entire meal. Now granted, I'm a fairly quick eater, and I was pretty damn hungry when I got there. So I'm not going to slight them for the lack of extra coffee. But kudos to them for bringing the milk with breakfast.  The check came around and before tip it came to $20 and change, which honestly seemed pretty overpriced for what I got. I mean, the pancakes were decent, the bacon was okay, a glass of milk is ... well, a glass of milk, and the coffee was average. Being that it's Las Vegas, I would have probably felt better paying around $15 to $17 for what I got.   The bottom line? I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here, but if I was in a really short walking distance and saw the prospect of one of those giant alcohol-infused slushies on my way back, I would definitely be down for the D Grill."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  Ordered the prime rib and wasn't expecting much with the diner-style decor. Our waitress was super friendly. Drinks and food arrived quickly. Prime rib was excellent!  It's a nice quiet little eatery tucked away in the back of The D."}
{"text":"I had the steak sandwich (not the philly steak)  It was very tender and flavorful.  The fries were some of the best I had in a while.  I will get this sandwich again next time downtown.   As an added bonus the waitress was attentive and friendly and the restaurant itself was away from the noise and comfortable. 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"If you happen to be staying at The D I would just steer clear of this place ?. We were drawn here by the breakfast menu but when we got there we learned it was lunch time. Fair enough, it was about 1 pm. After looking at the menu we decided we didn't want to eat here but had already ordered appetizers so we stuck with them. We ordered a basket of fries and the popcorn shrimp. Fries were cold when we got them but the shrimp...let me tell you about the shrimp. They were so small and had Probably been frozen honestly. They tasted weird and the size was unacceptable. We used our 2 $5 off coupons to pay for this $12 \"meal\" and decided to never return."}
{"text":"Ordered the Fish and Chips. Claimed to be Cod, but the fillets were too thin to be Cod, at least not any cod that I am familiar with (grew up with a father who sold seafood). That said, it  tasted fine, but was it was mostly the beer batter, not really fish. At least not much fish.  My sister-in-law ordered the Southwestern Salad. It was not very spicy, as you would expect in something called Southwestern. The chicken looked like something that was prepackaged, was cold and very rubbery.  Service was inattentive and rude. When my sister-in-law finally complained to our server about her salad, the server said that she ate too much of it and couldn't do anything for her. (Really?) Our coffee and water did not get refilled AND it took over 25 minutes (I timed it) to get our entrees."}
{"text":"stopped here as i was too tired to go out. asked for \"to go\". they were great-I ordered and it was served not five minutes later! I got the teriyaki beef with rice and macaroni salad. I also got the cheesecake which was to die for! the portions are large (two mounds of white rice!) and the cost reasonable-$12.99 plus $7.00 for the dessert. Staff was very friendly and quick even knowing it was a to go order. Thanks, D Grill! Oh, and it didn't hurt that I had a coupon for $5 off since I was staying at the hotel...."}
{"text":"How torn I am for giving this place my star review. I wanted to like their food, however that was not the case.   During lunch break I was convinced to go here to eat. I just had a feeling. But I went anyway. We get there and are seated right away. I like the atmosphere of the D Grill. They have cute booths and really wide chairs. The waiter was so kind, answered any and all questions. My friend ordered the french toast and I ordered ramen, without spam, which I guess I should have known better.   The wait was not long at all. Our food came out in good time. Just as he set the bowl down, my thoughts came to life. There is my bowl looked as if it was a .28 pack of ramen. I have nothing against them, as I buy them. I was just upset I had to pay $10 for it. Not like you get in an authentic place. Like I said, I should have known better. Took a bite. Sure enough. The texture was not like the rest. I couldn't send it back, though. Knowing it would be thrown away. So I sucked it up, literally, and ate it. My friend couldn't stop talking about how good hers was. Lol as I'm sitting there with this half bowl of noodles.   The guy there was great! He felt bad I didn't enjoy my food. I didn't say it, my friend did. And he asked if I wanted anything else. Of course I said no. Needless to say I don't plan on coming back. If someone convinces me, which I doubt, I will order something different."}
{"text":"The food is worse than Dennys. They charge extra for everything. I will go to anywhere else downtown. Never come back here"}
{"text":"Great food great people! Great service!! When in Vegas tgis is a grwat place to stay eat and play. Affordable and in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague.  As a matter of fact I would prefer the plague.  Minced Cobb Salad?  Cole slaw cobb salad.  The meatballs tasted horrible and the sauce was lacking as well."}
{"text":"Always a good breakfast or lunch spot if you are looking for something a little upscale from the traditional chain restaurants when downtown. The strawberry and marzipan french toast is a hit for breakfast. For lunch both the French dip or the meatball sandwich can't be beat. I dare you to try and eat all the fried that come with the sandwiches  Everything is always fresh and the servers are very attentive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service. Had Chicken fruit salad. surprisingly good. Very good fruit. Can't speak to rest of menu. I'm sure I'll make it back."}
{"text":"D-Grill was a recent trip we took based on Yelp reviews while vacationing in Vegas.  The restaurant was newly renovated, fresh with excellent staff.  My husband ordered the fish and chips, which were a very generous portion and good.    I ordered the Scallops and swordfish medallions.  I was excited to see swordfish on the menu because it is so seldom offered at restaurants.  The mashed potatoes that accompanied the dish were legendary.  I know that sounds odd for mashed potatoes but there was just something about them that was outstanding.  The swordfish was very good a little dry, however the 2 scallops that they offered with the dish, were overcooked.  For $21.95 I thought there would perhaps 4 scallops (2 seemed skimpy although they were nice large scallops. I did not even eat the second scallop, given the rubbery texture and I love scallops!!! I know they are tricky to cook and can overcook in the matter of minutes so please D's check that the next time.  It makes all the difference to an excellent 5 star dish versus a 3 star dish. All in all good place but I think they need to perfect the cooking of the fish just a bit.  I cannot go without saying that one of the Managing Staff (I wish I had the gentlemen's name) was outstanding.  Constantly checking with guests and even at one point took an order for the waiter so that the guests did not have to wait!  Service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Cafe's are a dime-a-dozen in Vegas - in fact - I'm sure the café to buffet ratio is 50/50.  Finding a café that's pretty decent is difficult though.  This one fits in the decent category.    It's kind of hidden on the 2nd level of the D next to the small (but mighty) high limit area.  We went in the early afternoon on Sunday and was able to walk right in.    The menu is fairly standard American Café food, but they have specials.  This day is was an Asian dish, which my partner in crime order.  I went with the basic French Dip.   The Asian dish was good - although I was told the combination was a little weird. The French Dip was delicious.  And yes - you CAN ruin a French Dip so this is good that I enjoyed it.  Service was friendly and efficient throughout, and the 2 Keno games was played (and lost) added to the fun.    All in all, we both agreed we're return to this place if it's what we're in the mood for."}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast here. Though it was only a two page menu, I genuinely had a hard time choosing from too many delicious sounding options, including the dinner options, which were available. Vlad, our waiter, was a true pro and really took it to the next level. My husband thought the breakfast was a bit expensive. In fairness, the breakfast and dinner options were the same price range, but I thought reasonable for breakfast and cheap for dinner."}
{"text":"Add a half star to my review.This is our second time that we at the D grill. The first time I had the fish and chips.  l thought the fish was average. You got a good portion for a fair price. The next time we ate there I got the spaghetti with meat balls, it was a pretty tasty and filling. Service was very good.  I will return to the D grill next time I'm in Vegas. We had a ten dollar off coupon which made our meal very affordable."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place for dinner last night.  I haven't posted a review in a while and thought this was definitely my opportunity so why not!  I'm a huge believer in the Downtown revitalization and support new and existing businesses.  This place is fairly new and has had some good reviews, so I was excited.  When you walk in you notice the clean \"D Grill\" logo, which I liked.  Turn the corner inside and you'll see a huge focal point: Charlie Brown zigzag pattern lining the walls, accompanied with forks and spoons lining the actual pattern. There's a black and orange color scheme. The colors on the ground are black, white and tan brown. The middle booths have high backs to break up the room.  The tables are a 50's themed brown and metal.  To me, it's a modern twist to a diner-grill.  Pretty cool, liked it a lot.  Our server, Susana, was really nice and accommodating.  I told her up front that we wanted our checks split at the end and she was more than willing to do so!    For dinner, I got the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut for $18.95.  At first, I thought it was a little steep in price for a downtown grill, however, I was willing to try it out.  It came with a basket of rolls.  They reminded me of a less dense version of a garlic knot.  The flavor was good, however, the roll itself seemed a little old and stale.  With my dinner, I had the choice of soup of salad.  I chose the side salad with balsamic vinaigrette on the side.  The salad was just iceberg and spring mix with one wedge of tomato. The balsamic vinaigrette didn't seem fresh, just your ordinary manufactured dressing.  Then came the main course.  Btw, it came super fast so I was happy about that.  At first, I was a little turned off by the plate presentation.  Very ordinary and didn't seem like a $20 plate.  Looks are definitely deceiving.  This place came with halibut, rice and veggies. The veggies were mixed veggies (broccoli and carrots).  They were steamed and then sautéed with garlic and butter.  In the middle of the plate was a scoop of white rice with a chive garnish.  Then there's the fish accompanied with an orange ginger sauce.  The veggies were cooked very nicely and really complimented the dish.  Wasn't too much of a fan of the rice.  I preferred more of a stickier white rice, this one was a little dry.  The fish was definitely the star of the show.  Perfectly cooked, lightly crusted and delicious.  The orange ginger sauce really took the fish to a whole new level.  I was impressed.    All in all, I really liked my first visit here.  Definitely worth going back.  I'm excited to try other things like the burger or other salads.  If you're on Fremont, come check them out!  It's a great surprise :)"}
{"text":"Well this new restaurant seems to amaze us with its proffesionalism. I thought we were dining at a fine dining steakhouse. They have a very proffesional server and busser. And the food itself are magnificent.  We ordered the fish and chips and the bbq baby back ribs and it was wonderful. The fish and chips are crispy and wonderful while the ribs fell of the bone and pretty flavorful. For a pretty decent price, D grill should be one of your fav restaurant when you visit downtown vegas. Especially when its located inside the D casino where all the action is happening."}
{"text":"My mom and me stayed at The D for a week and ended up eating there about 3 times we stayed there. If you are staying there, be sure and ask the desk rep for discount vouchers for the D. They gave us about 5 dollar vouchers which were coupons helping make the meal more cheap.   The first night I tried fried chicken, which was about 13 bucks and boy was it yummy. They are very generous with the portions, giving you exactly half a chicken for your meal, two people could share it. All meals come with salad for lunch/dinner. but the best part was the portions.  The second day I had the shrimp Alfredo which I was not impressed with, I knew I shouldn't of chanced shrimp in the desert. The southwest is not always the best place to order seafood unless its shipped in fresh.   The third time I went to The D Grill I had breakfast, which I can't remember the name of the dish, but it had fried corn tortillas which this cheesy mushroom sauce on top, with a fried egg smothered in pico de gallo, and sliced avocado on top and a drizzle of sour cream and chives on top of a bed of re-fried black beans.  The food was yummy and worth the money, just wish I could of tired out the steakhouse couldn't imagine how amazing their food is."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food and reasonable prices.  Service was on point, waitress was attentive and a manager stopped by to chat.  Will definitely be back next time I'm looking for a quick bite downtown."}
{"text":"Decent grill for what it's worth but make sure you know what that is exactly before you come. Basic menu, mostly reheated Cisco food, with enormous portions. I had the stuffed chicken which was okay but way too much to eat. Date had the chicken mushroom penne, which had WAY too much garlic (and I love garlic). Service and ambiance were fine but again for the price to you can find much better very close to this spot."}
{"text":"We stayed at the D and they provided (2) $5 off coupons at check-in. We actually ate here our first night and had excellent food and service, it's a really nice atmosphere that has bar food. My mom had sliders and raved about them so much she got them again a different night. I had a club sandwich one night and chicken strips another. All of the food was good and the prices reasonable. Our second visit we had a waiter who was totally bizarre, he was crass and rude and acted annoyed that we were there. . .I thought he was joking at first but once I saw a table leave before their food came I knew it wasn't a joke. All in all I think it's a good place to eat if you're staying on-site depending on the waiter."}
{"text":"Located upstairs in The D Casino.  If you are looking for good cheap light American Diner fare than this is the place to go.  Decent sandwiches.  Good light lunch spot downtown on Fremont Street.  This time I had the French Dip and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service.  We did have to wait awhile, but the food was worth it!!!!!! It's my third time I  Vegas but my first at the D and I'm loving it"}
{"text":"Let's open a restaurant in Las Vegas, build a big kitchen, have gogo girls dancing at the blackjack tables and not serve breakfast. Sounds like a plan Derek!"}
{"text":"I just got done eating at D Grill. In fact I'm writing thus sitting in the booth! I had a great experience. Service was great, tiny bit slow but I noticed the server has quite a large section.  I had the meatloaf and my friend had the prime rib special. Meatloaf was good but a bit dry and prime rib was excellent. So tender you could cut it with a butter knife.  Also had the onion soup and chicken noodle. Both good, onion had too much cheese for me but the soup i did taste was good. I preferred the chicken noodle over it. The chicken noodle was very flavorful and well done.  Everyone was friendly and helpful. They gladly substituted the marinara sauce on my meatloaf for gravy as I'm not a big red sauce kinda girl.   Overall the experience was very good. There aren't many places on freemont to get this good of food for such good prices. I was very impressed. Our booth was comfortable as well.  The place was clean too and a nice get away from the loud smelly casino and other restaurants.    Ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have stayed here before a bit over a year ago and the experience was great. Decided to stay again because we liked it. Well this has just been not so good to put it nicely. Drive in yesterday Sunday February 21st I was tired from the drive from Los Angeles I stayed in the hotel and had dinner at the Dgrill. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and a side salad with Italian dressing. The salad was a decent sizes and it was very yummy and filling, it filled me to the point that I couldn't eat my spaghetti. Stayed downstairs playing slots for a bit till it all of a sudden hit me and I had rush to my room. I have not left my room since last night 10:20 pm. I called my doctor and she adviced me that I seem to have food poisoning and to rest up and drink plenty of fluids and to call the restaurant and let them know and advice the hotel as well. So I do so thermanager at the restaurantsaid no one else has gotten sick, I work in customer service and as a mmaager, you don't say that to a custimer, you empathizeat the atthe very least and try to make it up with an appoligy. I got nothing. I called the hotel and the same thing. No empathy what so ever. I am not a weekend yougster drinking and partying, which even if I was I would still try and figure out the situation before dismissing it. I am paying over $370 for my stay here with resort fees which I am not able to make use of bea use I am sick and stuck in the room due to their food. I am beyond disapointed in the lack of proper customer serviceand empathytwards a paying custimer. I'm here for 5 nightsand fr the second time. And I write the good and bad reviews. The least they could have done was offer to keep me hyrated with water. We all know that everything here is high in price even the water.   Point is the place is nice. The food is good. But if u have an issue. Dont expect to be treated with any empathy or understanding.  What really ticks me off is the fact that they are making me go downstairs to the security desk to file a report. When I asked them to send someone up beca use of how bad I feel they refused and just said to come down when I'm better. I mean really. Go and assess the situation. Do your job."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the restaurant or the casino. I'm from Detroit and was expecting to see some sort of theme tying the place to my home city but I didn't see a single thing other than the American Coney Island. If you're going to advertise The D Casino to people in Detroit then at least show the city your are supposedly basing your casino off of some love! Sheesh! The food at D Grill was not great. The menu didn't really make sense. Not sure how \"Island Favorites\" has anything to do with Detroit. I got a southwest salad, my aunt got chicken noodle soup, my Uncle got fish and chips. The lettuce in the salad was definitely pre mixed like those Dole salads, my uncle's fish was over cooked and the fries were way over salted, my aunt's soup had a piece of raw chicken and a big long hair in it, also it seemed like it came from a can. The server didn't apologize for the soup. She was a bit older and very scatter brained. I don't plan on coming back to this place. Pretty underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Staying in the hotel, love the casino, as a local I like to stay here on weekends to have some fun. Tried this restaurant for the first time and the service here was terrible. Waitress left when we sat down and took a break. No one would help us, had to get our own take out tray as no one would get us anything we asked two different servers for drink refills and nothing. One employee saw me grab a to go box, and walked by laughing. Complained as we tried to pay walking out and hostess Scott said I'm not a manager and wouldn't  even look at me, just sat there day dreaming. Second hostess Jasmine was at least nice and apologized saying that doesn't sound right.   I ask for the manager and all she said is sorry I'll take it up with management, I thought I was talking to a manager, she didn't seem to care just asked you paid already right.  I'll never come back to this restaurant again. Terrible service and customer care/service, wasn't even a busy time, half the tables were empty when we came."}
{"text":"Where the casino is dark, with low ceilings and could stand an update, the D Grill is a very nice oasis.  With kind of a fifties diner decor and menu, the D Grill served some good food.  We came to the D to play the quarter horse race game and stopped at the D Grill for lunch.  We wound up having breakfast instead.  I had the Cowboy, which is country fried steak with with gravy along with two eggs and Texas toast.  The toast is served under the steak, but I would prefer to have it on the side.  Wife had two eggs with ham and toast.  Along with the toast they provide homemade strawberry preserves which are awesome.  Service was good and the food was good as well."}
{"text":"Pretty sure the \"D\" stands for defrost. Scores the 2 stars for friendly and outgoing service, but I can't imagine there's any equipment other than a deep fryer and a microwave in the kitchen. Oh wait, it's an hour later now, I think the D stands for something else......gotta run!"}
{"text":"The Fish & Chips hunt continues!  And yes, I had it for breakfast, lol!  Hungover and starving, my friend and I stumbled upon The D Grill today. Located on the 2 floor of The D Hotel & Casino in Downtown Vegas. They're open daily from 7am-10pm.  Serving mainly classic American fare, the The D Grill also has a small \"local\" section on their menu. If you're craving local Hawaiian favorites, they have chicken katsu, Korean chicken, Teri beef and even oxtail soup.   FISH & CHIPS ($14.99): 4 decent filets of cod are battered and fried to perfection. It was perfectly crunchy (not greasy) on the outside, moist on the inside.  http://bit.ly/1Ecba63 -I'm not convinced that cod was used, the texture was more meaty, not as soft and flakey as cod or pollack. However it was clean-tasting and quite tasty. -Served with a heaping amount of \"garlic fries\" and coleslaw. The crispy fries were seasoned with garlic salt (or dried garlic flakes seasoning) mixed with grated parmesan cheese.  D WINGS ($6.99 for 6, $11.99 for 12): Crispy wings tossed in choice of either bbq, buffalo or sweet thai chili sauce. Served with choice of blue cheese or ranch dip and regular fries. http://bit.ly/1tJOTd1 -I got the buffalo wings and I couldn't be happier! It was seasoned just right. Had the perfect balance of hot sauce (think they used Frank's Red Hot Sauce) and vinegar. I ate 5, my friend got 1....don't judge.  TUNA SANDWICH ($11.50): Albacore tuna served on sourdough with sliced tomatoes and lettuce.  -My friend ordered this and commented that it was tasty and also on how much he loved the bread. I had a taste of just the tuna and agreed with him. It wasn't overdressed with mayo, the tuna tasted fresh and not fishy.  I also liked that the bite I stole didn't have big chunks of onions in it, a fine mince is always nice. Kudos to the chefs.  SOFT DRINKS AND JUICES ($3): My ice tea had free refills.  Overall, a clean and trendy spot with reasonable price and friendly servers. Our server Mabel was a sweetheart and our busman (didn't catch his name) was such a friendly and chatty gentleman. We left happy, full and satisfied. Thanks D Grill!"}
{"text":"Service is always really good, servers are friendly . Food is beyond expectations always a goto for a good comfortable spot to eat with my family when we are on Fremont."}
{"text":"First night in Las Vegas - staying downtown and craving fish & chips and my husband wanted clam chowder. D Grill was the closest to us - that had both - so we gave it a try. We were pleasantly surprised - no frills restaurant but the food was great and so was the service! Our waiter was Kevin who was so nice and so accommodating - you can tell he loves his job and he's been doing it for over 40 years! The prices were reasonable, it was a good meal and we would go back again!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast at about 10:45 got a table within 15 min, got our order out within 15 min. Really good service & food. The cinnamon bun pancakes are delicious"}
{"text":"Went to the D Grill one morning for some take-out food after staying overnight. It's on the 2nd floor of The D. Just around the corner from the set of escalators on the casino floor or the elevators. The menu is displayed outside so you can decide if you really want to eat there or not. I walked up to the hostess table & asked if they do take-out. They said yes but they'd still have to seat me at a table & I would have to order from one of the waiters still. Thought that was weird but I was hungry & agreed.   I was seated at the nearest table to the host. The waiter in that section seemed quite busy. I remember distinctly him telling a party that was seated after me that he'd be right with them but there were 2 parties ahead of them. I was hoping he implied I was one of those parties because at that moment he still had not acknowledged me. He was taking down the orders of a table close by to where I was sitting. In the meantime a busboy and a female waitress had asked me if I wanted something to drink while I waited. At least they were on their game. The waiter came to take my order after about 5 mins of me waiting. Cant really say he made eye contact with me. Cant remember. He seem hurried but I was ordering one thing & I knew what it was. I wanted breakfast. 2 eggs scrambled, 2 bacon strips, hash browns & sourdough toast. I had to repeat my order to him. He must not have been paying attention when I clearly stated what I wanted the first time. SMH... Food came in a plastic bag ready to go about 7-10 minutes later and was given to me by the busser. Not too long of a wait. I still left a tip... It was for the busboy and waitress that had smiles and actually asked me if I needed anything. I understand I was only a take-out customer but i deserve the same level of acknowledgement and customer service as any dine-in patron. That's my 2 cents and I feel strongly about it.  Food wasnt bad. Hash browns were crispy on the outside and tasty. I added a little bit of salt. Scrambled eggs were standard. Bacon was smoky & crispy. Sourdough bread was buttered and plenty of Smucker's jam (grape & strawberry) were packed along with utensils & salt packets. Im glad they did because I forgot to neither check for them or ask."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was adequate.  Our server was nice but had way too many tables she had to service. Vegas during the holidays should NEVER have service issues. Way to many places competing for your money.   Step up the food and service and this will be a better place to eat! Until then... it's a pass."}
{"text":"Fair to say it's another typical casino coffee shop, short of not being open 24 hours. Don't expect a unique dining experience or haute cuisine- it's a standard fare of breakfast, sandwiches and a few familiar dinner staples- pasta, meatloaf, steak. There's an obligatory prime rib special- $13.99 for an 8 oz portion served with a dinner roll, potatoes and vegetables. Even though menu warns you \"no substitutions\", I still got all vegetables and no potato just fine.   Rest of family got chicken club- very average, spaghetti and meatballs- more mediocrity, and stuffed French toast- it looked like yogurt was oozing out of it, but I'm sure it wasn't.   Based on food I would rate them 3, service 5, so I averaged it out and gave them a 4. Service was fantastic- our waitress checked up on us continuously and drinks were refilled in a flash. Food came out lightning fast as well.    Upon check in I got a $5 coupon, which came in handy, not sure how freely accessible these are unless you are staying at the hotel.   Nice decor and definitely another well executed part of the remodel of the former Fitzgerald's, all in all it serves it's purpose, but not a place I would seek out intentionally."}
{"text":"I will never go back....... Waited 45 minutes for our food and when we got it it was cold......."}
{"text":"We are staying in this hotel and decided not to travel around the strip fighting traffic to find a place, so we decided to go to the D-Grill. We thought it was quite delectable. The service was phenomenal, if you have the pleasure of getting Richard as your waiter you will be in great hands. The coffee is strong and fresh, and you can get it to-go!!   I had the Eggs Benedict, the eggs were perfect and I was licking the hollandaise sauce off the plate, lol. The hash browns are crispy and soft at the same time, not overcooked or undercooked. My mother had The Little Three, the bacon was sweet and flavorful, the pancakes were taken off the griddle at the right time, very sweet almost tasted like a doughnut. They melted in your mouth, so good. It was very good, I'm very impressed. Highly recommend! I would add a picture but the food looked so good that I immediately started eating and completely forgot, I have no regrets."}
{"text":"The service was good. Very pricey for what you get. Breakfast with coffee for 1 is about $16.50. The ommlets are dry and tasteless. Eggs are runny, over medium, and hash browns, they need anew chef!! If it wasn't for the comp dollars we would have gone to Denny's. Nice breakfast with coffee and a large orange juice for $8.00. Great deal.  Don't forget to watch the skinny dancing girls at night.  What a trashy idea by the \"D\"."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy is absolutely delicious and service was great the second day! Came on Sunday and left because our 15 minute wait for a table turned into 45 so I don't know what normal wait time looks like but good food and a decent price."}
{"text":"My recent second visit to the D Grill was a great improvement over the first.  This time I  began with a bowl of real hot and outstanding creamy Clam Chowder filled with clams, potatoes, and a few pieces of celery.  This crock of smoking goodness that was almost like a meal in itself was just a little too salty.  Diane's cup of Clam Chowder was just as hot and good as my bowl, but at $2.00 less, looked like a filled thimble beside it.  Next up was a rather massive Side Salad with crisp and cool Iceberg Lettuce, multiple tomato wedges, sliced cucumbers, Red Onions, some snippets of Red Cabbage, and a few carrot splinters.  It came with an ordered Honey Mustard Dressing that was mellow, Dijon-like but milder, and excellent.  Then I enjoyed a generous portion of tender Tri-Tip covered with a delicious Brown Gravy, and served with a creamy and this time rather rich Mashed Potatoes; vegetables that were neither too hard nor too soft, but just right; and a tasty hunk of crusty Sourdough Bread.  Meanwhile, Diane waxed euphoric over her Beef Dip Sandwich dunked in great au jus.  I know because she insisted I try a bite; it was full of lean roast beef mixed with melted Swiss Cheese and the taste of a savory hot beefy liquid that nicely broke down the soft roll.  That fine bite convinced me to order this beauty for myself one day soon.  Our booth seating in the bright and modernistic dining room was very comfortable, and our pleasant server hopped to and fro with water refills, extra butter, and more au jus.  This just proves that restaurants that don't deliver too well on the first visit, but show some promise, should still often be given another chance months later.  A diner may very well be happily rewarded with marked improvement and a memorable meal!"}
{"text":"We had a stay at the D so in the morning we decided to grab breakfast here, especially since when we checked in we received a $5 dollar off coupon.  Breakfast was good but what I thought was awesome was that they make their own jams.  No prepackaged here.  I loved the mixed berry but hubby preferred the strawberry.  You could have also selected a peach and I believe one more but can not remember."}
{"text":"Our family of six ate here, the server just put down the food and went on a break. Nobody came back to our table for more water or napkins that we needed. But we automatically have been charged 18% gratuity cus there were six of us on the table. So we came to the front and told one of the staff about it when we paid. But she just told me if I want to wait and speak to the manager, no help, apologies or whatsoever. You don't get what you paid for here."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  A Food:  B Price:  B Customer Service:  A  I went there for dinner one night and although they looked pretty busy, the wait time for a table wasn't that long.  I liked the modern look and feel to the restaurant, it complemetns the D Hotel really well.  A lot of the furniture is that business/professional gray color.  Our server (I think her name is Lori) was awesome.  She was really friendly and although they were really busy and she had multiple tables to serve, she always made it a point to come a check on us.    She brought us their house bread which was alright.  Actually, I didn't care for it.  They were round, buttered rolls and maybe I just love garlic too much but didn't really taste the garlic flavor that she said they had.  Our food did take a while to come as they were pretty busy but she made sure we were taken care of while we waited (bread refills and she made sure to refill our drinks).    I ordered spaghetti which tasted pretty good; not the best spaghetti I've had but it was better than average.  My boyfriend ordered steak and I had a couple of bites-it was really tender and moist.  I'll know to order the steak the next time we're there.  Overall, the D Grill is a pretty good restaurant if you're in the downtown Las Vegas area (they're located on the 2nd floor of The D Hotel and Casino.  It's nothing too fancy or pricey but it's much nicer than your typical casual dinner spot to go to."}
{"text":"So very disappointed! We did the Caveman show & dinner package which is a fixed menu if you didn't know! Ordered tge seafood dip as an appetizer when something didn't look right....yep MOLD on the pita bread. Gross!! I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely filling, but its not great.The D grill is a full service restaurant, but due to the life choices I make, I usually end up here for breakfast only. I've had the eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and the house omelet and the only one I've loved was the omelet. That was a  work of art and the ingredients were fresh. Every other breakfast menu item didn't taste like anything that I couldn't get at any other diner. I recently saw online that they have saimin and Loco Moco on the menu, which gives them credit in my book because I feel like its hard to find good Saimin in Vegas even though we're the ninth island. I haven't explored the lunch and dinner menu, but I've tasted the sandwiches and they're good enough for if I'm out and about downtown and need something to soak up all the beverages that I'm consuming. Prices are decent. Overall, its middle of the class place that'll satiate your needs if you just need a quick meal but definitely not a destination breakfast spot, especially when you consider the places that are nearby"}
{"text":"Omg...please think b4 you eat here! Service I can 4give when feeding masses of drunks but really FOOD quality sooooo of matters...I've never been but my thought is this was worse then prison food!!! A damn shame!!!, that's it that's all!"}
{"text":"The D Grill....typical cafe style atmosphere like all the other downtown casino eateries. I came here for breakfast and to use my $10 food comp. I figure you can't go wrong with free food and breakfast...hey how can you mess that up ...right ?!? lol Well....as I suspected the food was not bad, I wouldn't say great because all I had was side orders of hash brown, bacon and ham.  The hash browns were prepared well, I like it a little crispy and it was just how I like it. Ham...on the smaller side with bone in, but tasty which made up for the small size Bacon....hmmm I guess making bacon is an art form cause some places get it and some don't! I would say it was ok, not the greatest. They gave 4 pieces which kind of made up for the fact that it was a bit cold, like sitting under a warmer. Would have been 5 stars if the bacon came out hot. The service was good and attentive which adds another 1/2 star.  Would I come back? Probably since it's convenient."}
{"text":"I stayed at the newly renovated D Hotel and Casino this past weekend and I was happy to learn that there were 3 separate eateries open 24 hours. After a day and then a night of drinking our group was looking for a substantial sit down meal and D Grill fit the bill. We arrived around 1a.m. and the restaurant was mostly empty.  From what I do remember (I was pretty inebriated at this point), I was very impressed with the restaurant's decor and ambiance. Our servers were efficient, quick and polite. I felt that the menu was well balanced and that there was a good selection even this late at night. As a matter of fact, the only items that were not available at that time of night were the dinner specialties.   We started with the spinach dip which came with freshly made chips. I also had a french onion soup which was very good. My husband ordered an italian sandwich and fries and he enjoyed that. My brother had a meatball sub and was not able to finish the large portion that he received (he is a big guy too!). My sister in law had hashbrowns, bacon and an english muffin - all standard. I ordered the hudson salad. It was decent, not the best salad I have ever had and I wasn't head over heels for the hudson dressing but it wasn't terrible by any means.   The food was good, the service was exceptional and the new decor is fresh and contemporary. I would dine at the D Grill again if I am ever on Fremont."}
