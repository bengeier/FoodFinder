{"text":"Nice little spot for a quick (and cheap) lunch if you're in the building. They offer a daily special and a variety of Italian sandwiches (veal parm, chicken cutlet, etc.) accompanied by soup or salad."}
{"text":"Caf√© Fanelli is tucked away between tall buildings and can be easity overlooked. 
It's bigger than you would expect inside, with a nice sun room that welcomes the morning light. 
The prices are not too expensive, especially for sandwiches and soups. We went there to grab a coffee this week, which turned out ok (a little too sweet). They're really close to a tough competitor (Tim Hortons), so I'm guessing they're pretty good at capitalizing on Italian comfort food! Will probably try their veal sandwich next time!"}
{"text":"I went here for a Christmas/holiday/year-end event. The place was decided by our unit's social committee. Even though I work close-by to this restaurant/cafe, I've never gone there.

Our year-end event took place when the place was closed since this place closes roughly after lunch (based on their Facebook page at 3pm). Our event was at about 5:00pm. Roughly around 20 people showed up to our Christmas/holiday/year-end event and even though this place is what I would consider to be small, it wasn't overly crowded.

In terms of the food, for our group, they prepared:
-Green, Greek, and Couscous Salads
-Penne Arrabiata
-Chicken Marsala
-Salsiccia Peperonata
-Lamb Stew

For dessert, we had a chocolate fountain with fruits for dipping, cannoli, and mini cupcakes. For beverages, we had cappucino, expresso, late, coffee, tea, water, soft drinks, or juice.

After the menu was already made/decided and the cost per person was already determined, I had made a request to our social committee to see if we could also get the plain/cold tomato pizza (sorry, but I forget what it is called) and the owner of the place accommodated my request at the same price.

The food was very good. I found everything that I tried to be very delicious.

I can't comment on the prices and what they serve for breakfast/lunch since as I mentioned, even though I work relatively close-by to this place, I've actually never eaten here for lunch (but that will probably change) but I heard that they have different lunch specials every day which range from lasagna to ribs. Not really connected to the \"underground city\" but if you know which tunnel/exit to leave at from the underground city, in case of bad weather, it only represents less than 10 seconds of braving the elements to get to this place. Even though the street address mentions that it is located on Sherbrooke Street West, I entered this place from University street (which I believe is also called Robert Bourassa). From this entrance, it is right adjacent to a very small pay parking lot

I saw a machine at the cash register so I believe that they accept credit cards and/or debit cards as well as of course cash. There is free WiFi here but you need to ask for the password."}
