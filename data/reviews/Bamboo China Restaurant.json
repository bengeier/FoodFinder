{"text":"My friend Max, a local,  recommended Bamboo China.  I called up for delivery. We decided on the Broccoli  Beef and the Lemon Chicken. It came with vegetarian spring rolls, Crab Won Ton  and noodles. The portions are huge. There were three of us but there was more than enough food  for four people.  I ordered out twice the week I was in Phoenix. If you're looking for tasty,  reasonably priced Chinese food with quick and friendly delivery, call em up."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place!  I've been eating there for years.  Food is always good, especially the walnut shrimp!!  Their home made pot sticker is also one of my favorite.  You can definitely tell those are homemade.  I usually do take-out because they dont have liquor license.  However, I have hosted a couple parties there and the server took good care of us..  Unless you have a big party with kids, otherwise I'd recommend doing take out."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food, delivery included, and we ate for kings for days after. Ton of good food at great prices. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"As you can see, I have eaten at BC many many times. Have always ignored the fact that the inside is dirty because the food has been good and cheap. But recently the filth in the place really has grossed me out and I cannot overlook roaches and bugs. The owner is a nice enough guy, but has no clue how to properly run a restaurant. The food is hit or miss now. Sad."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I moved to Phoenix 6 years ago. I tried all the places in my neighborhood, and this is the best!!  The owner is awesome and remembers you if you're a regular, even your order!  Any time I get a cold, I order soup from them and it makes me feel better - the soup is HUGE!  Like one of those big yogurt containers huge.   I have had the lo mein, the fried rice, the mu shu pork and the pot stickers and all are excellent - the mu shu is simply to die for!!  My boyfriend has had a lot of their seafood dishes and loves them as well.  I don't ever want to move from this area because I found the best Chinese food in town right in my neighborhood!  Prices are great and delivery is quick!"}
{"text":"All I can say is look through the door behind the register and you will see the filthiest kitchen in the city. I've seen better health standards in third world countries."}
{"text":"I've been ordering Chinese delivery from a different local restaurant for a while now. No need to name names. I ordered tonight from Bamboo China, and it was very good. The pot stickers are as good as you will find anywhere. Everything arrived well packaged and hot. I had the General Tao's chicken. It was very tasty and not too sweet. I also had the Ma Pao Tofu in garlic sauce. Very nice. The hot and sour soup could use a little more \"sour\" and a shrimp or two wouldn't hurt. That said, the black pepper level is perfect. Loved it. Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"I often order the Dinner-for-Two for delivery. It always hits the spot and is a great value."}
{"text":"I've recently decided to go vegetarian. I've had their dishes before that were meat, like the sweet and sour chicken. It wasn't on the menu about substituting tofu in for meat, so I asked if it was possible to get tofu instead of chicken and get everything else that comes on it. The lady agreed. They deliver really fast (and their dine in service is wonderful). Even with the tofu substitution, it was wonderful. The tofu was a good texture and really went well with the ingredients. I really recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has the best shrimp fried rice I've ever had. It also has very good egg flower soup that has chicken in it. Large portions, good prices, tasty food."}
{"text":"Stay away from the Kung Pao dishes; just your normal meat and veggies with brown sauce + siracha + whole peanuts. I had to request additional siracha hot sauce and peanuts. I don't know if it was even stir fried; seemed just warmed up. Poor service too, especially since there were only 2 tables of patrons. The portion was large and the food came out quickly, which is all that is saving Bamboo from a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Very plain, nothing special.  Got food to go and they forot the drinks that are supposed to be included in lunch special."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever eaten. Fried shrimp puffs were fried in old oil. It left a disgusting aftertaste in my mouth. Same with the orange chicken. I can't imagine how anyone could find something positive to say about this place."}
{"text":"This place has to be some of the worst Chinese food in my life.  Seriously, I am wondering if it is some kind of joke.  I ordered delivery from this restaurant, the delivery was executed by a courier service, the order took roughly one hour.  I ordered vegetarian spring rolls, and a green vegetable stir fry.  We are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our Asian grocery stores sells as, \"spring roll wrappers,\" made from rice paper.  I did not intend to order fried, greasy mess rolls.  These were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot, they were significantly darkened.  Judging by the amount of residual oil, the oil was old and not up to temp.  According to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry, \"the name says it all.\"  We'll, that's clearly a lie because the name didn't tell me it would be awful.  The dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy (wouldn't have ordered if it were only bok choy)...seriously...no scallions, onion, carrot, or any other veg besides the bok choy. The veg was limp and gross, topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor.  There was a little sauce, I am not sure what it was made from and I am a very serious cook, my guess would be oil, freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener.  These were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor.  On the side were fried rice and low mein noodles, it's just slightly weird to get rice AND noodles, both of which were dreadful.  The rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables, the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture.  Nothing was seasoned or flavorful- I poured everything they sent me to try to help it out, this went badly.  There was a tempura shrimp and crab Rangoon on the side, I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian, but they looked and smelled awful, it wouldn't surprise me if someone became ill after eating them.  The Rangoon was definitely previously frozen, and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating.  I literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie ( generic made by the Kari-Out-Co) lacked fortunes, and I am not making that up.    This place definitely needs a health inspection, and probably needs to be closed.  I really feel bad if locals eat here, please try Chinese food in coastal California, Houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference. Overall, this was just epically bad. They don't deserve the one star, consider this the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Bamboo china since I moved to the neighborhood in October.  The cashier is nice and the service is quick. In March, I decided to order my usual and picked up some Chicken Fried rice. To my surprise, I got more than just chicken, rice, and vegetables. I also found a dead fly in my meal. Needless to say, I will not be ordering from Bamboo China again."}
{"text":"Happy to have found great Chinese Delivery from Bamboo China. Tried and really enjoyed Mongolian Lamb, Eggplant and garlic, Mu Shu Pork and the Mandarin Scallops! Fast and HOT delivery too. :) Now my first call..."}
{"text":"We got our to go order of Mongolian Lamb with a bit of a kick & lots of onions, chicken chow mein with crisp vegetables, crispy fried prawns, tasty crab puffs & our new favorite spot to get egg flour soup! The young guy at the counter was very polite."}
{"text":"Still the same great service.  I reccomend the egg flower soup and the hot and sour soup for anyone with a cold and sore throat."}
{"text":"The food is ok, a bit greasy but most Chinese food is now-a-days. The staff is really nice and they will cook to order off the menu if you ask."}
{"text":"When we walked in and the place was empty we should have turned around and left.  But the guest service person at Squaw Peak Resort swore it was amazing Chinese food.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken ... Far more vegetables than chicken, skimpy on chicken.  Oh, it gets better - I'm so damn sick this morning I can't even stand.  Someone please shoot me!"}
{"text":"This has been our go to Chinese for years. Love the food, always consistent! BBQ pork ribs, chicken salad, mu shu pork, Mongolian beef, Cantonese rice noodles and walnut shrimp are all our favs! We also can't order with out getting the sizzling rice soup. It had tons of fresh veggies, shrimp and chicken in a delicious  broth. Best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"The food is great, for cheap food. This isn't a 5 star Michelin rating, this is cheap chinese food. Their schezuan beef is super yum. Service is quick, and quiet."}
{"text":"Your typical Americanized Chinese food! We got 25 dollars worth of food for 4 people. Crispy garlic chicken, beef and broccoli, and fried rice were great! Wonton soup tastes like chicken broth with ginger-- which I loved. Delivery was quick, too!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I have been craving Chinese food so we decided to try Bamboo China. The restaurant itself was completely empty  and the inside was pretty sketchy looking. Not a good sign for a happening Friday night. But the employees were friendly and they did seem to do a lot of take out business because the phone was ringing off the hook. We decided to order a variety of different dishes since Chinese leftovers are the best! We order the Szechuan beef, broccoli beef, and lemon chicken. Before the entrees we got won ton soup which was really tasty, not too salty like other places. Our entrees came out really fast and were big sized portion's schezuan beef was average and wasn't as spicy as I like. My favorite was the pork fried rice because it had a bunch of veggies. Our total was $27 which I thought was pretty inexpensive considering the amount of food we got."}
{"text":"Just okay. I ordered the Mongolian been and it was nothing special. Panda Express beef is actually better in my opinion. Price was high and not a lot of beef.. way too many vegetables in the dish."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today shortly after 11. Nobody else in the place (customers, I mean), so of course I was greeted and seated immediately.  The garlic chicken was tender and perfectly garlicky, the egg drop soup delicious, the sides more or less standard-issue (but still tasty). The servers kept my cup filled with soda and otherwise stayed out of the way.  Shortly after I started on lunch, a few other people came in and were greeted like family  - guess they were regulars.   I don't get up this end of town much, but next time I'm there I'm definitely going to come back. to Bamboo China."}
{"text":"Skip this restaurant. We found a METAL shaving in our chow mein. [no seriously--look at the picture.]"}
{"text":"Delivery is super fast. If you think you can jump in the shower after you call in your order, you'll end up answering your door in a towel."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I read the review but sorry the food was nasty. I'm from Chicago and i have never tasted anything so discusting. Rice had no flavor, noodle were salty as well as my Kong pow beef. The only think i liked was the fried shrimp. I ended up throwing my food away. What a waist of money and food. Fast delivery."}
{"text":"We had spring rolls, dumplings, orange beef, lemon chicken, and a shrimp dish delivered to our casita at the Hilton squaw peak.  All were excellent, hot, and tasty."}
{"text":"I'm going to help you here, I should have walked out when I walk in and the place is empty-but I didn't and grabbed a table and set up my computer, next I went to wash my hands-oh my god!!! This place should not be operating! The health department should get in there- horrible, horrible, horrible dirty!!!! Okay, well I felt bad and sat down, the nice lady came in and asked if I wanted a drink- I asked for a tea- she said sooo sorry we only have Pepsi and diet Pepsi and they serve it out of two liter bottles!!!! Too cheap to fix their dispensing machine! I ordered beef chow mein- hopefully I'm okay...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been looking for a good chinese restraunt in the area and I think we found it.... 2 visits thus far and we are still pleased!"}
{"text":"This place is good, not great. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a try. The place does a huge take-out business. And the folks that runs the place are really nice. They will deliver but it always is 40+ mins. I opt for the pick-up which has never been more than 10 mins! Outstanding. They do the basics really well and if you order your meal combo style it will come with fried rice, chow mein, and what I call 'the bag of goodness' which contains an eggroll, a crab wonton, and a fried shrimp. It's like a full sampling of all things fried! Let's face it, it is never going to be on the diet so why not just enjoy."}
{"text":"Bamboo was very busy when we stopped in to place a to-go order during a conference lunch break at the Hilton. It appeared there were only two people working and they appeared a little overwhelmed and it was quite a wait before we could place our order and we saw our lunch break dwindling away   We ordered the shrimp and vegetables (I know - not a fan of ordering shrimp so far from ocean) and the tofu and vegetables. They were okay. Oh and if it matters to you, no brown rice option"}
{"text":"As a very close, local chinese restaurant, it's our go-to so far for chinese as we are new to Phoenix. The first few times we've had food here, we thought the fried rice was phenomenal. I particularly didn't like the chicken and broccoli though. We've also tried lo-mein and other types of fried rice and they were very good. Decently priced but I give 4 stars because chicken and broccoli is usually my favorite."}
