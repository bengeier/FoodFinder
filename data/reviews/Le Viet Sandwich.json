{"text":"Le Viet sales frozen yogurt... Aaaaaaaa!!!   Coming from NYC, I'm used to Korean frozen yogurt... So, I needed to compare... Always looking to see if other places can beat NYC...  Sure enough ... It was the BEST frozen yogurt I have ever tasted...  And the BEST in Mtl (forget all the other commercialized frozen yogurt places, I've tried them too).   It was good: not too tart, not to sweet...  It was refreshing... I couldn't get enough of it... !!  And the little brownie I added was not too sweet, not to hard... Just perfectly melting in my mouth..  Thank you for the experience!!"}
{"text":"Got a bahn mi. 5 star flavor (great bread!!!) but not very much filling (sad).  Overall reasonable if you need a quick sandwich under 5 bucks."}
{"text":"I'm really glad I found this little gem. It's a great place to go if you're looking for a quick bite to eat in the area. The banh mi sandwiches are hot and crispy. Generous on the filling too with the juicy meat and fresh vegetables. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Le banh mi au boeuf grillé garni fait vraiment la job pour 6$. De la coriandre, oignon rouge,  carottes râpées marinées,  jalapeño etc. La prochaine fois je veux tester le smoothie fraise mangue avec bubbles."}
{"text":"This place is quite good, and fairly priced. The Pho (or Soupe Tonkinoise!) is fine, and I enjoyed the friend pork spring rolls too. One small thing would take it to a FOUR: They need larger spoons for the Pho. You get a nice large bowl and a microscopic spoon. If I had not switched to drinking the broth from the bowl as a giant cup, I'd still be there ladeling it out with the little thimble-sized spoon. Nuts!"}
{"text":"It was kind of meh, I had a rice bowl with pork and I had to add some beef because the meat portion was quite small. The meats didn't look very appetizing really... they looked quite dry and they warm them up for you before putting it in your plate. I feel like I would have preferred not seeing the meet in order to eat it more comfortably. Overall it's cheap and fast. But quality... a little low for my expectations."}
{"text":"Great specials, really good sandwiches and for a good price, too. The rice noodle dish wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't at all bad, either.   Staff is friendly, especially the owners. If you want a good, wholesome meal for 10 dollars, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I tried the beef sandwich. Every ingredient was fresh, the sandwich wasnt ovverstuffed so you can feel the taste of each ingredient you choose. It was quite good and Very very cheap ...escpecially for a restau right at place des arts"}
{"text":"Come here for a quick bite of their banh MI.  Traditional in taste and I got extra pate with it. They toast up their baquettes like subway for you. Trustable if you want something traditional"}
{"text":"Can't believe how little meat they give in their banh mi. Really pathetic.   Otherwise the bread is decent.   Nothing looked fresh.   I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hyatt and needed a quick bite before my flight. I ordered the BBQ pork Bahn Mi and to be brutally honest it lacked flavor and heft. There was barely any filling inside, the BBQ pork was dry and the vegetables were skimpy (the cheapest part of the sandwich).  The bun was good though, with a crusty but not hard exterior. The sandwich was less than $5 so I suppose there isn't too much to complain about but having had some amazing Bahn Mi in other places for the same price, this was slightly sub par which is disappointing because I'm always looking for good Asian food close to the hotels I frequently stay at."}
{"text":"My go to place when I want an inexpensive meal near place des arts. Stick with the sandwiches and you won't be disappointed. A good choice when the festivals are going around and don't want to over pay for food or don't want the typical fast food."}
{"text":"Les sandwich son bon. Leur poulet general Le viet (aka poulet general tao) Super bon. Croustillant a volonté comme je les aimes."}
{"text":"Prices are fair, although the Pho and rice dishes were really not worth going back for. I'm going to try the sandwich next time, as that looked delicious. If it falls as flat as the soup and rice dishes, well, they're getting demoted to a two-star. I'll try it next week. PS I'm a part-time vegetarian. If I were full time, I'd avoid it.  1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"C'est correct. Rien de spécial. Je préfère Vua, où ils mettent beaucoup plus de viande dans leur banh mi. Prix semblables.   I definitely prefer Vua, you get more for your buck even though both places are pretty cheap.  I've only had the banh mi. They skimp on the meat."}
{"text":"Mauvais service mauvais attitude!!!!!!!!!! Ne jamais essayez.......................................,,,"}
{"text":"Pas mal mais pas de grand émoi non plus!  Le pad thaï au poulet était plutôt bon et en bonne quantité, bon rapport avec le prix à ce niveau.  J'essayerais de tester les Bahn mi la prochaine fois, je pense que je serais plus convaincue!"}
{"text":"I always got the tastiest banh mi in Montreal from Le Viet. As a Vietnamese myself, I have tried all the places that make banh mi from a tiny counter in asian supermarkets to the popular Vua on St-Denis, but the banh mi at Le Viet is another class apart. They have set the standard for banh mi at another level, that so far no one have accomplished yet. Their banh mi is always delicious and generously stuffed. The baguette is always fresh(soft in the inside and crunchy when you bite). My favorite is the house special they called it simply LeViet, stuffed with sliced pork and veggies(marinated carrots,  fresh coriander, etc...). The pâté in there is amazing(that is the secret). Whenever I pass by downtown, I always take a banh mi (live on the spot) and take half dozain  to go home, simply because I cannot resist to the flavor even knowing that home is on only 15 mins away. And when settling at home, I will bite in my 2nd one."}
{"text":"Just bad on every level! Their food not fresh. Delivery not like we order and impossible to communicate because they dont speak French or English where you come with problem! Viet ! Never again you should lost your business! Viet mafia!"}
{"text":"What a great find in the midst of all the hoopla of place des arts. We had already ate lunch at McDonald's when we stumbled upon Le Viet. I walked in out of curiosity and then just had to try their food.   For $11 CAD they had a pork banh mi sandwich and small pho combo. It was a deal considering at McDonald's we paid $18 CAD for a meal and a half. The set up is like Subway and Chipotle. You get to customize your sandwich and soup. I got the sandwich half spicy / half mild and overall it was just right. The sandwich isn't giant but it has everything it needs to be a decent sandwich. The bread they use it good too. As for the soup, even though it is small sized, I found it to be a giant bowl of pho. It was very filling with plenty of noodles. The broth was tasty too.  I don't agree with any of the negative comments on the previous reviews. The staff is really nice and the place is very clean. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I raved about how delicious the banh mi sandwiches are!  W both had the grilled chicken.  He also had the Pho and said it was very tasty.  The best part of the sandwiches was the extremely fresh and warm French bread.  Service is super friendly, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bahn mi sandwiches ware huge, I had the grilled chicken spicy and small pho combo meal. The combo size was generous, plenty of food. I had left over Pho."}
{"text":"Im going to be generous with my rating because they were really nice.With that being said I had the grilled chicken Bahn Mi.Ive had these sandwiches for years in major cities and consider myself a expert.The bread and veggies were pretty good.Bread toasted, veggies crisp and fresh.The chicken wasnt the best.It was under seasoned,a lil gamey in flavor.Maybe I will try the pho instead next time if I return.Also it was the most expensive bahn mi I ever had.The best ive had in the city was a place near the jean talon market and another believe or not at eaton mall..so yummy.I wont reveal who in respect for this business."}
{"text":"Il est 19h et on a faim... Pas envie d'un restaurant mais de quelque chose de rapide... On est dans le coin et on passe par hasard devant cette sandwicherie/fast food viet, voilà ce qu'il nous fallait! On commande et on paye au comptoir, je prend une soupe tonkinoise au poulet, le bouillon un peu trop salé et gras mais ça fait ça job! Mon cheum choisi le carri poulet, épicé à souhait, il se régale! Le commis nous sert nos plat à table, cellulaire à l'oreille...moyen. C'est parfait si vous êtes pressé et avez une envie de manger asiatique et es prix sont plus que raisonnables, mais le service et à améliorer. J'y retournerais pour sûr afin de goûter leurs bahn mi!"}
{"text":"Got a grilled chicken rice bowl and a spring roll. Food was fast food style. Nothing too appealing, I feel that's something I could make at home. This restaurant is well-located if you wanna grab a quick meal before events near the corner at summer time. However, nothing too fancy."}
{"text":"It's called Le Viet Sandwich for a reason. This shop's specialty is clearly neither vermicelli bowls nor pho. Both lacked toppings as well as flavour. The pho was okay, just with a boring salty broth. The vermicelli bowl, though, was legit horrible! Do not order! They use a weird, super-fine angel hair rice noodle that is just dry and nothing more. Definitely don't come here expecting authentic.  Did enjoy the powdered coconut bubble tea though! Also the people working there were nice!!"}
{"text":"Found this place in Montreal during a weekend getaway with a friend. The grill chicken vermicelli was ok at first but then it got incredibly delicious! Everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the concept! It's like Vietnamese subway!   They've got all the fixings and trimmings out and about, for the banh mi sandwiches or the noodles. All you have to do is pick what meat you want with your meal and your done! Fast, fresh and not too shabby.   We needed something quick before catching our flight back to LA, so this was perfect. Plus after eating so much poutine on this Canadian trip, it was nice to get some noodles with asian flavors for a change.   It looked like there was a station for the banh mi and noodles and then in the back there was a station for boba drinks and then the very back it looked like froyo! And it looked like another section was under construction. I guess I would have preferred that everything be finished before opening up for business and I just wasn't too sure what they were going for, Vietnamese fast food boba drinks and froyo??? plus a mystery stand? It was kinda weird.   But the station that we tried, the sandwich station was pretty solid!"}
{"text":"Pho from a place with any level of courtesy, a professionally made logo and plastic bowls is exactly what you'd expect it would be."}
{"text":"Un des pires restaurant que j'ai été. Le prix payé est beaucoup trop cher pour la portion en assiete. Aliments d'aucune qualité"}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches and great spring rolls and the tacos are also pretty interesting. Doesn't cost much either, which is always nice too. The staff are super friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and the best part of it is how cheap it is!    A sandwich is around 4-5$ and it is so filling!! the only thing that I don't like is that the majority of the sandwich is bread. Like many other sandwich shops in the downtown area that offer cheap sandwiches, they are often pretty empty inside. which to be honest is justified because of the price. If I was paying 10$ I would expect more meat and veggies etc...  But if you are hungry and want something cheap and delicious le viet is a great stop and one of my favourite Bahn Mi places in the downtown area."}
{"text":"The bread was great but just not enough filling for a bread that big. Perhaps the sandwhich is not the way to go."}
{"text":"vermicelli in the bowl was old and stale. I ordered combo C which comes with a roll but did not get one even after asking for it. the rilled pork Bahn mi was okay."}
{"text":"Très très ordinaire...  sandwich ? ??  Non un gros morceau de pain avec 17 ou 18 grames de viandes environ.. de la garniture ? ?  Vous avez le choix entre les carottes rapper, les onions et les piments fort... Même pas de fromage. .  Non vraiment pas..."}
{"text":"I went for the bahn mi and a soup and neither were particularly authentic or memorable. Something was off on the flavors. The flavor was lacking on the bahn mi, in the meat and in the pickled veg, and the soup was a lot of noodles, few pieces chicken and a couple shredded carrots. Nothing like photos I saw online. It was okay I guess, nothing bad but nothing I would get again. Bahn mi is hard to nail, except maybe one place further uptown I haven't seen it done right in Montreal yet. I would have loved a real great bahn mi place near by but they're hard to come by in this city. Otherwise the price was pretty good."}
{"text":"A really great spot near place des arts for some delicious banh mi! Came on a weekday evening, and it was more quiet but also close to closing time. The shop associate was friendly and happy to serve us despite it being 30 min from closing.   I decided on the tofu banh mi. The server was kind to ask my preferences of how spicy I wanted the banh mi as well as what toppings I wanted and in which quantity.   The banh mi was really fresh and delicious! The jalapeños inside made a really nice touch that gave the banh mi an extra kick. They have classic banh mi toppings which are fresh and tasty like onion, carrot lettuce etc.   There is ample seating inside including a nice barstool area which has a view of place des arts.   Also, the price of the sandwich is so affordable! Definitely a great spot for dinner or lunch on a budget. I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Not a very good representation of a bahn mi. They use onions instead of daikon radishes, they don't pickle the vegetables enough, VERY SKIMPY ON MEAT AND PATE. Mostly all bread! I would have rather had just the bread with butter for the price! Not authentic whatsoever! I am of Asian decent and this was by far the worst I've had to date in my travels. Come to Lowell, MA for the real authentic ones!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and if I can get a Vege-Thai option its even better. This place although in a great location ( just on Place Des Arts) is a little hidden. They have great Banh Mi sandwiches but also a nice \"do it yourself\" ice cream corner where you can choose the flavors (not that many) and toppings. The ice cream is Yogurt base(or water for the Sorbet) so it is not a sweet as normal ice cream. Perfect for those warm days or Festival time.  Forgot to add free Wifi and low prices :)"}
{"text":"Amazing subs! We bought the BBQ pork and the chicken and it was awesome. $9.50 for two sandwiches! Yum! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Gross excuse for banh mi. Shitty service. Nope. Never again. They should learn the number one rule for customer service. Respect the customer. Second. The food is gross too. Wack."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, cheap!! So yum!  If you're looking for a fresh tasty meal, and like Asian, this place rocks.  And the frozen yogurt is t bad either, although watch out as you will probably spend more on desert then your meal!!!"}
{"text":"Great bahnmi. Vegetarian marinated tofu, or BBQ porc are solid. Sping rolls are reliable too! Best cheap option in the hood."}
