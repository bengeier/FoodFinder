{"text":"I've been several times and have not been disappointed yet. The food is typical tex mex but really good! I typically get one of the crazy big burritos and my wife gets one of the chicken dishes (Aroz Something or other I'd butcher spelling)."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, since they were located at the top of the hill in their old location. Now they're behind Talbots and harder to locate, which is a pity. This place would do very well with a driveway access onto a busy road. I would guess that its mostly the locals that come in here now, and its good enough that they've managed to stay open with only that kind of traffic. The food is well above average, and I'm especially fond of the House Special Dip. My wife is from Denver, Co, and mexican is her favorite food. Denver has a huge mexican population, and there are many, many authentic restaurants there. She rates this place with the best of them ! Good food, good service, reasonably priced. Worth the effort to find this place !!"}
{"text":"Ewwwwwwww . Food was awful...how do you mess up carne asada??? Should have known it was gross...Saturday night...no customers....that was a red flag!!!"}
{"text":"If you're mexican you won't like it... The service was poor.. They forgot about me, I had to ask someone to take my order and stand up and go to the register to pay. Not coming again."}
{"text":"The Mr. and Mrs., along with their children, first started eating at this restaurant when they were the El Vallarta (on Main Street in Pineville).  We have always been pleased with them, not only for their food and service, but for the general atmosphere of friendliness.  When they changed their name and ownership from El Vallarta to El Veracruz, we stayed with them, as not much changed.  When they moved from Main Street to their present location, we stayed with them.  The food is consistently good.  The Mr. recommends the enchiladas verdes and the quesadilla Veracruz.  The Mr. says the torta was good, but contains too many jalapenos.  He says next time he will request they leave them out.  The Mrs. finds that they are willing to accommodate alterations to her order, and very willingly too!  This makes her very happy.  Younger Son loves this restaurant. This is usually his first \"go-to\" choice.  When you are seated, a generous basket of chips and salsa is served.  The Mrs. finds the salsa too hot.  Unfortunately, the only alternative is something that tastes like thin marinara sauce, not quite what she has in mind when she requests \"mild\" salsa.  This means she winds up ordering either the cheese dip or the queso fundido (woe to her waistline).  Get the queso fundido!  A bowlful of yummy heaven-on-earth for your mouth.
The service is excellent; the servers always remember you; the owner is always  friendly.  It is good value for your money.
The Mr. and Mrs. (and Younger Son) highly recommend El Veracruz.

{"text":"I'm from Southern California and the Mexican food here in Charlotte can not even begin to compete but this place I would give a 7 out of 10 . They are pretty good. I've been there twice and would go back. It's pretty much as good as it gets for Mexican food in charlotte ."}
{"text":"The edit staff was very friendly and helpful, and the fajitas for two was delish!  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"this is a great mexican joint in pineville. great outdoor patio area with large tvs. the inside decor is pretty standard mexican restaurant so i usually choose this place in warmer weather. 
chips and salsa are good. they have a wide variety of beer. food is relatively cheap and fast. good portion size.
the food here has never wowed me but i have really never been disappointed either. 
this is a great place to go for a leisurely lunch or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"I love this Mexican restaurant!  Great covered patio, tasty chips and salsa, excellent Mexican beer selection, and cheap prices on food!  Ole!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I own family business, and we go every Friday to this place for Mexican Lunch...it's fantastic as always!! The staff are awesome & super-friendly, the food is always fantastic (pretty much had everything), and I love their new restaurant, nice and big!!! Thank you, I would highly recommend this place, does a great job!!!"}
{"text":"In town for a tournament and staying at the hotel right next store. Traffic in the area was heavy and we wanted to stay close by. Based on the reviews it seemed like the best bet for 4 adults and 4 kids in the area. Staff was friendly and we were seated quickly. Complimentary chips and salsa were bland and watery. The main course was also lacking flavor and overall we were not impressed. Kids meal portions were large and at 3.95/meal were a good buy. Despite that we would not recommend or go again."}
{"text":"We loved this place when it was up the street.  I thought they had closed for good and was so happy to find them again!  Sadly, i didn't know they had moved for over 2 years.  2 years without their wonderful cheese/beef dip!  Went back for a pick up order today of super chimichanga carne asada, and it was one of the best chimi's I have ever had, with fresh diced red tomatoes on top and guacamole!  We will definitely be going back to this one every time we get the urge for Tex Mex food.  (I was born in LA, so it is difficult to compare since back west the Mexican restaurants were true Mexican with more heat and usually better guacamole.  I even have eaten street vendor beef tacos in Baja California and in Mexican restaurants in Caborca, MX, and most USA Mexican is Tex Mex.)  But still berry, berry good ;-)"}
{"text":"Best steak cascades I ever had. Chicken soup, and Flattened chicken were great!
Portions are MASSIVE but tastefully  presented"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here and the prices are very reasonable.  It's my boyfriends favorite new Mexican spot.  Me, I'm a burrito girl and they have several different types on the menu but not exactly what I was looking so they have always made special accommodations for me and that's worth coming for.  The cheese sauce on my burrito makes it out of this world but their salsa is rather bland and I love cilantro in mine.  I always ask for pico and they happily bring it so I can add to my salsa for extra flavor.  The staff is very cheerful and personable."}
{"text":"Great mexican, nothing fancy, lots of specialty dishes, awesome value, and just holy cow tastiliciousness"}
{"text":"I love this place! The old patio was amazing, so it's a bummer they moved locations, but still one if my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I have tried a few things off the menu but my tried and true is La Texana. :) Also, the frozen margarita has to be the strongest and least expensive one around! Anytime my friends suggest another Mexican restaurant, I finish my meal thinking that I should have went to El Veracruz. Every. Single. Time. Guess I'm a Mexican restaurant snob, but nothing compares to this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is NOT closed...  just a bit tricky to find behind Talbot's off P-M Road. Our party of 5 went here on a Tuesday night (2-19-14) and had excellent service. The freshly made salsa and chips are bottomless and free. It always takes a while to scan through the menu because of so many selections beyond the typical combinations offered everywhere. El Veracruz has menu items you will not find elsewhere... I am still exploring the menu and finding dishes that I still marvel how good they were days later. This visit I had the \"CHORI-POLLO\" and will be going back soon to have it again! Anyone who likes grilled chicken, chorizo, and wraps using flour tortillas will enjoy this selection. Comes with the usual tasty Mexican rice and beans, but the mix of chorizo sausage, grilled chicken, and cream sauce if a delightful surprise. Served with four steaming tortillas to make wraps (similar to fajitas)... so delicious that words cannot do it justice.
Another in our party tried the \"pollo adobe\" (which was my other possibility for the evening) and declared it to be wonderful. Moreover, El Veracruz is STILL the only Mexican restaurant that I know of offering so many delicious steak entrees under $20. The specialty burritos they offer are all stunningly presented and delicious as well!

If you like wraps or fajitas, do yourself a great favor and go here for the \"CHORI-POLLO\" which is still deliciously on my mind 5 days after having it.

 FWIW... this is the second year in a row that I've chosen El Veracruz to go out with a few friends celebrating my birthday."}
{"text":"We stop by late Saturday, we saw it says Mexica restaurant so we though we going to have a nice dinner and a nice time. Well, on Saturdays is like a bar or night club, didn't let us go in because we were using converses  it gets me upset because it says RESTAURANT no nightclub"}
{"text":"Slow service, but friendly server. Chips were stale and unsalted. Probably from the previous night.
Ordered lunch burrito and pointed to the picture on the menu.  Was priced around $6.75. Burrito was huge and came with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber. Bill came out where it charged me $10.50. Was told it was after 3, so I had the dinner portion.  It would have been helpful if the server told ve that ahead of time!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time tonight. My favorite has always been el Vallarta in Monroe, but since we moved to steele creek the drive is too far to go there. It's comparable but not quite as good. They weren't crowded at all. Atmosphere was good. Server could have been better."}
{"text":"Been to many typical Mexican restaurants around the Charlotte area over the years. Stumbled upon Veracruz and wow! Very good lunch specials, including the Cheesesteak burrito. Very tasty steak and black beans wrapped in a burrito covered in cheese sauce dip. Side of lettuce, tomato, sour cream rice and beans. Muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"Just got done eating my food. Awesome experience. Good queso and burritos and even the chicken tenders are good. food came up quick and sever got us everything we needed. Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican place in charlotte... May have just toppled taqueria Mexico on south blvd as number 1 from my list. The server we had was very pleasant. Ample seating, their booths are really spacious... They have a huge projector screen, would like to go and watch some soccer there if they play on TV. The food was really really good. Pollo adobe is a must try. I couldn't finish more than half of the dish, so the portion size is big. Pollo con crema is also good. Flan was also very delicious. I know what's my go to place in charlotte for Mexican from now on..."}
{"text":"Soooo much food! Portions are enormous. Pretty yummy, though not to die for. Service was great. Hosts and servers alike, everyone was really friendly and attentive. Jazmin, our server, did a great job & always had a smile. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I can't recommend it. I sampled chips, salsa, burrito, enchilada, chile relleno - all lacked flavor. The recorded music playing on the patio speaker was loud and really bad. Hoping the owners make some needed changes."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place!
Stopped in one night for dinner and even though it was really empty, we waited about 5 minutes to be seated...
The salsa is very watery with no flavor.
For my meal, I got the burrito, tamale, and enchilada plate and it was meh. 
The tamale tasted like it was frozen and not thawed/cooked all the way, it was cold and hard in the center. 
Probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first time there as my friend bought me dinner for my birthday.  He knows I love good Mexican food.  I must admit at the beginning I really love the food. The service was just OK perhaps we were late. I really planned to give good tips as I asked how late the waitress would work caused we'd stay after dinner to dance.
One thing that I felt like being scammed as there was a 15% tips on the bill without prior notice.  I do know many restaurants will pre-add 20-25% service charge for party of 5 & above (with signs) but not 2.
There are many restaurants selling liquors that is the highest profits business but don't fool customers who are drinking. 
I was still sober as I need to drive.

If they have fine print for that sur-charge, pls show to me with light.
Sorry if I've upset anyone to this place. On my way home, I felt so thirty that I poured a liter of water into my body once I got into my house. Perhaps caused by the seasoning they put in the food.

I'll still visit this place as there is food, drink & dance."}
{"text":"The place is spacious, and inviting. I enjoyed my meal and thought my waitress was beautiful, but that's not the point of this review. lol

Dishes are plentiful, well plated, and great service. Check it out for lunch with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town! Affordable! Big portions! Great service even when busy. And to my understanding they have great dancin on the weekends. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Very very authentic Mexican restaurant. The pricing can be a bit odd and the bar is very nice. Very friendly staff and very friendly people. They close typically at 10pm which sucks but it's something that you need to get used to living down here."}
{"text":"Wow. Delicious, great service, huge portions, reasonable prices. I'm so full and happy. Awesome selection of hot sauces at the table. Ugghhh I'm so full. I love it here."}
{"text":"Restraunt is clean and friendly, just lacks FLAVOR. Salsa is crushed tomatoes......Margaritas are out of a jug which the do not hide. Food portions are large but taste like bland spaghetti sauce. Meats have little flavor as well. If you cant handle seasonings or spice this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We went here for my boss' birthday dinner. The margaritas were excellent (from what I was told) & the service was descent. We had a very large party of 14, and the food still came out in a descent amount of time, and everything was hot which is always difficult to get when you come in with so many people. Overall the food quality was good... I was disappointed with the desserts however, so my only recommendation is do not go here for fried ice cream because  you will be disappointed as well."}
{"text":"This is our all time favorite Mexican restaurant!  The food always tastes fresh and delicious, the portions are enormous, the prices are low and the employees are friendly. Every person we have taken here has been impressed. It is tucked away behind the Talbots off of 51 in Pineville so it's easy to miss it. They are a great place to take large groups because the restaurant is huge and they can almost always seat you without much wait. My husband and his brother love the burrito Veracruz which is the same size as their heads. My favorite is either the arroz con pollo which has the chicken chopped up and no bones to fiddle with or the pollo chipotle which is gloriously spicy and cheesy."}
{"text":"Ok traditional Mexican. Good service. Nice place. Just didn't love the food. Think shredded chicken"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!!! The bartender is very disrespectful and rude. No person should be working in customer service if you do NOT know how to treat a customer. I asked for a drink with light ice and he responded, \"If you want half ice,  I will give you half the drink\"."}
{"text":"I love there food. Especially the guacamole...can't get enough!! I definitely would recommend it. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Service was great. Margarita ok. Chips and salsa pretty good. The entrees were bad, even for my six year old daughter."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure in Pineville, NC with quality food, generous 'Rita's & reasonable prices! I had the Burrito Veracruz and it was wonderful. Plenty of pork carnitas, beans and three different sauces; green, white & red! Think about it... Fajitas were had by my mate and she say good flavor, take home portion & a let's do it again! Stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had big table with only one server, who couldn't keep track of anything. Some food was slow coming out or never came. Tried telling us to leave because we had children and they were closing into a club but the kids parents were waiting on food that they had already been waiting an hour for. When we talked to the manager saying we had a problem with service, he responded \"talk to your server\". Seriously probably some of the worse service I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Here to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. It took 45 mins for  our food to come out and then it was all wrong. It took longer for us to get silverware. Horrible service tonight. Food was good, but service was not up to par. I had a bad service experience the last time I was here too. Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"They have the BEST SERVICE around. They are so accommodating. We have girls night sometimes before a late movie and they stay open after hours for us. There are no other restaurants in the Pineville area that will do that for us. Great Food also!"}
{"text":"I stand solid by my first review and really feel confident that if you stop here for a tamale or fish tacos you'll find the food and flavors are all on point. 

The place is the real deal.  After all these months all I can really say is ... try it you'll like it .... I'm sure !"}
{"text":"Delicious! Will substitute any dish for vegetarian option and the veggie quesadilla was the best I've ever had! Salsa is a little weak so I added some hot sauce. Great queso. I tried the cheese enchilada and it was great. I'll order that next time!"}
{"text":"Bait and switch Friday Special on website. No such special as Fajitas for 2 at $18.95. Beware website promotion! Food not very good. Will NOT return. Too many Mexican options nearby."}
{"text":"Had pretty high expectations after seeing four stars on Yelp. This is not a four star restaurant. People were nice, but the food is pretty mediocre.  Chips tasted like cardboard. Food was bland. All in all, very underwhelming."}
{"text":"I've come here several times and this place has never disappointed!! The service is always outstanding! The drinks are consistent! And the food!! Ahh the food is delicious! They serve authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price! I've brought co-workers, my husband, my sister, friends, just about everyone I can think of to come eat here with me :) Love this place!"}
{"text":"Coming from san diego we always love finding good tex mex restaurants. We found el veracruz 5 years ago when it was located just up the street from where it is now. This place is great, staff is very friendly, service is very fast and i have never had a bad dish here. Even after 5 years we re still regulars, eating here aboutonce a week. I would recommend el veracruz to anyone looking to get away from chain mexican food establishments."}
{"text":"Great food, good and quick service.  Nice atmosphere although they have changed locations recently to a larger building... Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Great food with great service.   I will definitely be back.  They also had huge portions that the men in our party really appreciated."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for dinner while on vacation.  We both felt that the food was as good as when we were in Mexico.  Authentic Mexican!   The guacamole was made fresh to order and served with fresh chips and homemade salsa.  My husband had Carne Asada and I Fajitas.  The seasoning used in the marinade was amazing.  If you are ever in Charlotte or Pineville NC don't miss this hidden gem :). Appeared to be a place the locals love."}
{"text":"Icky, ordered chicken enchiladas which came with a mystery meat that may have been steak... Not sure was so unflavorful...and lukewarm:("}
{"text":"Was very pleased with this restaurant.  The parking lot was pretty full and it was extremely hot outside, but inside it was nice and cool.  We were seated right away and chips were on the table in under a minute.  While I like my salsa on the spicer side it wasn't bad.  I ordered the special for the day chicken fajitas and the wife had chicken quesadillas.  Both came out with huge portions of rice, beans, and veggies.  
One thing I can't stand is chicken fajitas with no flavoring but these were good and there were mushrooms included which I've never had before.  Very good.  One thing that surprised us was the cheese dip which had a small amount of refried beans at the bottom and wow it was good.

All in all we have been looking for a good place to eat by the mall and this hit the spot for us.  Great food, and great service with a smile. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"7 of us visited for lunch on a Saturday (adults and teens).  Service was very good and everyone enjoyed their entrees.  The lunch entrees were just the right size and ordered off the regular menu and the portions were very large (may want to consider splitting between two people.

Based on this experience, we will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I never been here for lunch or dinner, but Saturdays after hours the latin party it s greeeeeat. The Colombian DJ really plays very good latin music to dance, recommended for a cool  latin party on saturdays.

P.S. i get some chicken nachos they were very good (it was very late) but they were good!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over eight years and the food is always good, fresh and hot will nice sized portions for the price"}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! I love this place! The fajita for two can feed four. Their Orchata is a tad bit watered down but I guess people like it like that. They greet you at the door and the minute you sit down, they have chips and salsa ready for you (complimentary).

The have lunch specials until 3pm. 

Their Tortas are pretty great too."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to get food here today. I got the queso and a taco salad. Everything was so perfect. My staff is always going here so I thought I'd try it out. It's right by the mall. It's very clean inside. The staff is nice too. I will be by here more often."}
{"text":"I came here wanting to venture out and try a different Mexican restaurant l other than my usual favorites. This place is a little different sense it has a sports bar appeal. After I was sitting I was brought out the usual chips and salsa.  I wasn't impressed with the salsa u thought it was bland and the chips were cold. I ordered the vegetarian combo which included a bean burrito, cheeses quesadilla, and a chalupa. The burrito was bland but the chalupa and quesadilla were my favorite. My server was quick and attentive. I would rank this place as average nothing special."}
{"text":"I went with my mom to celebrate her birthday and was pleased they keep the kitchen open late. Our waitor was preoccupied with other people, gave my mother pork when she specifically asked for chicken in her enchiladas, never brought me my 3rd beer and that's after he took forever to take our order. Food took over 30 minutes to arrive and the wings suck. I know, wings at a Mexican restaurant aren't something everyone would gravitate towards but I wanted something just to snack on while we listened to music. Speaking of music, that is this place's only saving grace. It's why it got 2 stars instead of one. No pics taken, they turned all the lights off by the time we got our food. I'd go back, but after I've eaten somewhere else and just to listen to music."}
{"text":"I'll give them 4 starts. It's not quite what you'll get in California or any of the border states but it is certainly a notch above your tex-mex chain restaurants.

The prices were certainly fair and the portions were pretty huge. 

Feel free to stop by and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Mexican food a favorite of ours, so we decided to try this restaurant. Good service, nice ambiance, reasonable prices. My son in law said his margarita was excellent. The guacamole Fresca so tasty with cilantro , red onions and tomatoes. Chips were brought  out warmed. 
We  ordered bean burritos with chalupas and a soft filled taco
Food was fresh,  nicely plated and delicious. Portion size average.
Kids  menu too, chicken tender and fries ordered.
Menu includes popular Mexican cuisine 
We will return to try other menu choices as ever thing we tasted was delicious"}
{"text":"After Monterreys i didnt think i could go to another mexican restaurant and be satisfied. This place does that. Most everything was cool.

Do yourself a favor and go here. The food is good. Atmosphere is awesome. The one thing i don't get is that their salsa isn't great and you have to dress it up. Mexican restaurants have to make great salsa! If you candle spicy order their spicy salsa mix it with their regular and put some salt in it. Awesome! However i don't like to make a concoction at a restaurant. Thats the whole reason i go to restaurants.  Other than that their regular salsa taste like it came out of jar. You have to dress up ur food, and do it right. Thats why they only got 3 stars, other than that i enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to eat Mexican food in the area. The prices are cheap and there's usually no wait time. The staff is very friendly. The only con is it seems that the margaritas are watered down but a good trade for decent food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by being in town on business.  Great food.  Yuliza was a great attentive bartender.  The staff was great.  Can't beat the price of food/alcohol.  One of if not the best Mexican restaurant I have been to.   I'll be back.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Honestly, fairly disappointing with this place. I'm not sure how it has 4 stars. The food is very mediocre. We got the spinach dip and it was basically just melted cheese with bits of cut up spinach. The dip tasted like someone just nuked a block of cheese with a bunch of frozen spinach on it. We traded our dip out for the guac Fresca which was actually pretty good. But that whole process of getting dip and then guac took forever so by the time we got our appetizer, our entree was here. I got the spinach enchiladas which were good, but the portion was tiny. We also got some drinks. My mojito tasted pretty watered down, but we also got the margarita and that was solid. 

Overall, I'd say the food was mediocre and the service was below average, so the restaurant gets 2 stars. I'd stay away from this place if I were you."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte!!  Everything is great!!  Atmosphere, the food and the staff!!  Very fun place for delicious food!!  The chimichangas are awesome and the quesadillas and burritos are as well!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE El Veracruz! Our family has been coming here for almost ten years. Great food, good prices, very family-friendly."}
{"text":"Got El Veracruz dip size large, no where near enough chips to eat the dip, asked for some extra chips, and was told that it would be a 3.00 charge, just for some extra chips. Food usually good, prices a bit crazy if you need extra anything"}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to for weekday work lunch! Ever since they moved to this location El Veracruz gets it done!

There are times when things go slowly, but typically they are spot on and expedite the belly filling process.

Try not to eat too many chips and spoil your appetite for the entree! Trust me, it's very hard - and they are not shy about the portion sizes even when you order a lunch portion.

I'm a big fan of the hawaiin quesadilla, and fajita burrito. But, I haven't been disappointed by anything on the menu."}
{"text":"My all time favorite Mexican Restaurant! The staff accommodates their guests to fullest.. even making some dishes that aren't on the menu!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different down in Pineville, we stumbled into this place - good thing, because there is almost no way to find it unless you are really looking. There is next to no signage that will lead you to believe that there is a restaurant here, and it looks like it's abandoned.

While the inside isn't much to write home about, the service is actually quite good and very friendly. Food is brought out promptly as well. Good thing, because it doesn't give you much time to look around and run from the surroundings.

While the food may not win many contests, it is definitely hearty and gets you full, with plenty to take home. It is perhaps not authentic, but it is worth a visit if you're in the area. The chipotle crema especially was tasty on a crisp day, as it had a nice bite to it."}
{"text":"I'll be honest I dont remember what I ordered but the sauce on it was so good. I think I got a burrito lol wait staff know exactly whats in the food I dont line peppers n onions its in alot of mexican food n spicy. I had the kids salsa lol Great spot in pineville lots of seating."}
{"text":"I went here because it was one of the few restaurants within walking distance of my hotel. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The chips and salsa were very good. Fresh chips and the salsa was not too spicy. I ordered a burrito with steak and cheese (I forgot the name of it) and it was EXCEPTIONAL. Probably one of the better burritos that I have had in a long time. Service was friendly and prompt. Anytime I needed anything they were right there."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever.  Service great, food definitely worth the wait, my favorites are the taco....it's like OMG!!
I am 10 years old and have been going for seven years.  When I walk in, it is like Norm on the TV series Cheers.  La 
niñita."}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it. I got the chimichanga podillo and it was sooooooo good"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food that is well-prepared.  I highly recommend the shrimp tacos and the fish tacos.  My husband loves the Veracruz \"flag\" burrito.  There is a fried cheesecake dessert that is the best one you will ever try.  We have always received attentive service and have always had a pleasurable experience dining here.  We enjoy sitting on the covered patio outside when weather is warm."}
{"text":"Quick lunch. Cheerful, Attentive staff. Food is the traditional Mexican cuisine you are used to enjoying. Ive never dropped by after hours but we are staying at the hotel next door for a wedding in May..should be fun :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican restaurant!  You need to try the shrimp tacos and the guac. This place is one if the favorites."}
{"text":"This location is not very good. The food is OK but had little flavor and not proportional. The chips are baked and have little flavor, they taste like you opened a giant bag of Mexican style chips and heated them in the microwave. The salsa is like a tomato paste and again, had no flavor. I got a frozen margarita that was just kind of mushy, not well mixed and what little was frozen melted away quickly. 

The lights are a little too bright for a restaurant and the music was bizarre. Music alternated between holiday and traditional Mexican. 

Overall the food was really bland and the restaurant was awkward. I won't try this place again."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town! Bar is fantastic as well, my wife swears by the Margaritas and there Miami Vice! Great pricing and food is always excellent. We love this place and love the people who treat everyone like family."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food (even for Vegetarians) and great service. We got three enchiladas; one with bean cheese, one with grilled vegetables, and one with spinach, all of them were delicious. Get their complimentary hot salsa (green); it's super tasty and it won't burn your tongue."}
{"text":"The food in this place is alright. It's typical of one of those low-end Tex-Mex resturants"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant. I love this place. The chicken Nachos are the freaking best and my brother loves the beef nachos. I also am a huge fan of the enchiladas. They always have an event on cinco de mayo that's really fun to attend. My brother and I just happened to go over on this day early in the say like 1pm  on a Saturday and they have lunch specials everyday even on weekends. They had the nachos as one of those items its a little smaller plate size but its more than enough for your serving.  the dink specials were good too I love this place hands fown the rice and beans are also to die for I'm telling you its good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here after reading all the reviews. Gosh was I disappointed!! I ordered combo #1 and only the rice and taco was edible - the enchiladas were terrible. I also ordered guacamole which was disgusting and I could tell it was old. Don't come here! Azteca beats this place all to heck. Sure wish I could find a good Mexican restaraunt here!!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican with a bit of a sports bar vibe to it. Like so many of the others in the Charlotte area - no better and no worse. A-OK.

I had a burrito with chicken sort of thing, which came with the usual rice and beans. It was tasty and it was hot. It was good. My daughter chose a chimichanga and she enjoyed hers. The chips and salsa was good, but not the chunky style I prefer - this was more like a spicy tomato sauce.

Would I go here again? Sure, why not?"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place is here. It gives the other local Mexican restaurant a run for its money. I haven't had one bad experience and I've tried just about everything on the menu ."}
{"text":"I ate at this place today for lunch.  It was a group of 5 of us, we walked in and were immediately seated at a table. As soon as we sat down she took our drink orders and came back quickly with our drinks and 2 sets of chips and salsa. She then took our food order and without even writing it down she got everything correct on our orders. The food was ok. Nothing special, just your typical Mexican restaurant. Except my \"crunchy\" taco was soggy and wet. I mean really, drain the meat before you put it in the taco. My major complaint is with our waitress. Though she was quick, she was super lazy! Our table was in the middle of the floor with plenty of room to walk around us. However, she put everything we asked for (With the exception of main entrees & drinks) at one corner of the table and just walked away. Chips & Salsa, Straws, Napkins, Extras (Sauce, lettuce, tortillas, etc), a box(only 1 of us needed it and she sat on the other end of the table) and even our checks!! I mean really lady?? You can't even hand us our own checks? So the whole time we were passing things across the table that she was too lazy to hand to the person who ordered it. We're sitting there looking at each others checks trying to figure out whose is whose!! Absolutely ridiculous. The entire time she never even smiled! Not once! Not a thank you or anything! I will definitely not be returning to this place on my own."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of another yelper, I tried this place for lunch.  

This restaurant used to be in an old Hardees building and I loved the patio there but they recently moved down the street to a larger building behind Talbot's.  

On the inside it looks like the place doubles as a nightclub since one area has sparsely placed tables and there are colored lights up on the ceiling.  On the front wall appears to be  where a DJ booth might be with cables coming down from the ceiling.

Anyway, the restaurant is spacious and a better than the previous location.  

The service was awesome.  My server said I made a good selection on my order.  It was something that was recommended to me but I can't remember the name of it.  On my next trip, I'll order the Pollo Fundido and compare it with Monterrey.  Anyway, Paola, my server was very attentive and friendly.  

The food was decent;   The guacamole was great.  The salsa was good but not as good as Monterrey's.  The meal was something I wasn't expectiing.  Chicken in a spicy sauce on tortilla chips smothers with cheese and onions.   It was a nice change.

Maybe with another visit or two, I can update my rating on this restaurant."}
