{"text":"Sadly, I wholeheartedly agree with Brittany's comments. The owner is  somewhat of a \"cracked pot\". This is truly too bad because the business has such potential ... Perhaps it's time for a new owner."}
{"text":"Not a very welcoming atmosphere. Owner asks people to move to different seats if more important customers come in and want to be seated there. Good antipasto salad. Nice staff of waiters and bartenders though I can imagine it might be difficult to work there where even the customers are micromanaged. The band is usually great if you are allowed to sit where you can see them."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food. Specials every day just like Mom cooks. Summer months there is an outdoor bar and restaurant in the back with live music. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Great beer but a bit weak on food,  would come back for the beer.  I would give it a another try!"}
{"text":"So today we are at Rico's Restaurant, Lounge and Patio Bar which we have had good and bad experiences that over the years.     Tonight, we are informed by our server they are out of chicken in the restaurant.  How do you not check your inventory at the beginning of service on Saturday night when half of your menu is chicken...  I guess the server mentioned it to the owner, Eric who then came to our table, mention that he knows are used to be a food critic.  Then told me that I probably was not really a food critic before I retired from E-Portage / Google News.    He then told me he runs out of food because none of his servers or cooks tell him anything.  And that his primary cook is an 21-year-old and doesn't know what he's doing.  Then, he told me that he \"just doesn't give two fucks anymore\".  This is reminiscent of him a couple of years ago when he got into an argument and almost a fistfight with one of his servers in front of the entire restaurant...   Or the time he lost our credit card slip, and then called me out in front of the whole restaurant on our next visit because he was not able to tip the server when he lost the slip  Needless to say, this will be the very last time we dine at this restaurant. My advice to you... Stay away, stay far far away."}
{"text":"Exceptional establishment, service was outstanding Michelle AKA Chuck was phenomenal! Polite, knowledgeable and pretty easy on the eyes! The lasagna was amazing and the bruschetta was out of this world! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Decent patio. Manager has been rude on multiple occasions.  Cute bands in summer outside.  Cheap.. This place needs more servers.  The manager/owner served us..got some things wrong, and then charged us for it."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. The owner is a maniac. He was clearly drunk and tried to tell my husband he wasn't allowed to order more fish until he cleared his plate, and by that time the kitchen would be closed. We argued and eventually he agreed, but not before yelling at us and causing a major scene. Will never go back again. Such a dump."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars ever! I unfortunately no longer live in the area but try to drop by every time I'm in town.  Rico's is your wonderful and friendly local bar you wish could move with you. Drinks are reasonably priced and deliciously made. Service is great every time. I love the patio in the summer, especially to play cornhole, but the indoor bar is a great area to watch games.  Food wise: fries are SO good, some of my favorite. Wings are also awesome. Can't honestly say I've had much more than that on the menu bc I'm always craving those when I go.   It's always a fun night at Rico's!"}
{"text":"I visited this place while traveling. Some locals suggested the restaurant and were right. Food was good, Service was great. I would definitely try it again"}
{"text":"Came here because it is home of a local \"Packer Backer\" club. We are having so much fun watching the game and eating and drinking. Service was a tad slow, but the place was packed, so it was understandable. We ordered mini tacos and potatoes skins...yummy. bar food at its best! Can't wait till next week!"}
