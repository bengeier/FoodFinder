{"text":"This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE the appetizers especially the pork buns. YUMMMMM.  However, that's where the positives end. The ramen was a salty mess. If it's going to be salty, at least be flavorful but it wasn't even that! Bland and salty!!! You pay for a spice bomb which is a tiny little cup of sriracha. How about leave a bottle of sriracha out like any other restaurant? You ain't that fancy.  Service was blah. The kitchen staff and the owner are great I hear, I believe that. But our waitress at the time was .... stupid to say the least. But hey, service is always a hit or miss at most places.  Anyways, if you go here, prepare to spend quite a bit of money for mediocre food."}
{"text":"I think the best way to do Umami is family-style with a group of friends. Order everything, share it all, and split the bill evenly.   That's what I did on a cool fall night. We sat out on the deck and ordered the following: pork buns, spicy pulled pork buns (the special), beef buns, pork dumplings, the ramen special (served cold with raw veggies), and the pork ramen.  Out waiter, Spike, was incredibly helpful in guiding us along. He suggested that if we wanted to split ramen, they could separate the order into two bowls and add a bit more meat and noodles for a slight up charge. It was the perfect amount this way! He also was nice about informing us about he intriguing things on the menu that we weren't familiar with, such as the \"garlic bomb\" (pur√©ed fresh garlic blended with butter... Add a touch to your pork ramen! Soooooo good!)  My favorites were definitely the spicy pulled pork buns and the pork ramen, but everything was delicious. I loved the fluffy buns and the tender meat, with just the right amount of heat to everything. The warm, flavorful ramen was just what I needed outside on a night with a bit of a chill.  I definitely was feeling the high salt content later, but it was so worth it. Just be sure to wash it down with some water and/or a pint!  I'll definitely be returning with my crew for a no-fuss feast!"}
{"text":"I was actually afraid to try this place after reading mixed reviews about it on Yelp. However, as ramen and noodle-like lovers who go to ramen places all over the world, my husband and I just had to try it. How cool is it that Madison has a ramen place?? However, we're glad that we went because this place is not as bad as some of the reviews. First impression: this place is quite nice, despite construction on Williamson St and rennovation on the front porch (I believe they want to open an outdoor patio). Our waiter was super friendly and quite charming. Now, the most interesting and important part, the foods! Pork bun (2 pieces for $6): yummy yummy yummy.  Love the soft bun, super love the fatty pork, love the pickles, and the sauce. For me it was an umami experience (sweet, savory goodness). I also added the spicy bomb (I'll talk about this later) to add a little kick to it. In short, it was heaven in my mouth. Large pork and chives dumpling ($8): Errr not worth the price. I don't think it's homemade but I could be wrong. For 8 dollar, I can go to a Japanese grocery store and get a pork dumpling and you won't taste the difference. Tonkatsu ramen: Good noodle, great soup. However, the soup wasn't hot enough that you smell the porkiness of cold ramen (i want to say fishy, but not sure if they have fish stock at all). For the price and the small portion, I'd say it's overpriced. The only place I spent 12 bucks for a bowl of ramen was in NY, but the portion was bigger and it's NY afterall. I  We also added the spicy bomb for a dollar hoping it's something interesting but turns out it's like sambal oelek and we're very dissapointed with this addition. Why can't they give this for free? A piece of advice for those who like spicy ramen, just ask for the chilli powder (which they have, btw, I saw it on their drink station) for free."}
{"text":"I have been using Yelp for some time but opened an account strictly to get the word out for Umami.  I thought Natt Spiel was the hot Asian place in Madison, but Umami blows them out of the water.  The atmosphere was unique and inviting.  The owner was helpful and friendly, but the food...the food is amazing.  I eat out a lot and it's been awhile since everything has been phenomenal from beginning to end.  We loved the Tuna Poke with the pork rinds, the pork buns are delicious, and the dumplings are cooked to perfection with a spicy sauce that has flavor rather than just heat.  I waited too long to give this place a shot...Let's keep this unique restaurant afloat in the tough competition in Madison.  It's different and delicious.  All these reviews about being too salty and overpriced are WRONG WRONG WRONG. I never salt my food at home and hate it when restaurants overdo it.  Umami does not overdo the salt and for two people: 3 cocktails, 4 dishes: $65, not bad at all.  I would have paid $160 and walked out very happy, it was refreshing and worth it."}
{"text":"A delightful find.  A slightly limited menu, but otherwise first-rate. Friendly and welcoming staff, and definitely on the list for a return visit.  Pork buns are superb."}
{"text":"This was my first time having authentic ramen, and it was amazing. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The food was amazing. It is in what used to be a house, nice relaxed atmosphere and overall nice experience. I went with someone who has had a lot of ramen in Japan, and he was really impressed!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch.  My taste buds had an experience. I had the breakfast burrito.  Amazing!  My boyfriend had the Japanese omelette.  Both were amazing.  The service was also amazing."}
{"text":"My rate is solely based on their steamed pork buns. They are one of the best I've had (they melt in your mouth!). I am a sucker for ramen and this is not one of my favorite but not terrible either. All in all a good place to visit. Be sure to get one of their \"flavor bombs\" for your ramen, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Everything you look for in a restaurant: - Delicious food (try the green tea mochi) - Good ambiance - Friendly staff!!!!   Great experience :-)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Umami at least ten times. Why do I go back? Here's why:  (1) Pork buns. These are the best I've had. Try for yourself: have the pork buns at Graze (or wherever you eat pork buns), and then have them at Umami. Umami's are better. I'm not trying to start a pork bun war, I'm just sayin'.  (2) Tonkotsu ramen. This is Umami's signature ramen, so rich and delicious. And that egg everyone's talking about? Get yourself one. De.Lish.Us.  I've never lived in Japan, so I have no idea how Umami's food stacks up against the ramen served in traditional Japanese homes. But I do know this: last year, I was seriously considering becoming vegan, full time. But I couldn't do it, because I knew I'd never have Umami's pork buns or tonkotsu again.  True story. Go, enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I have had better dumplings out of my freezer, but two stars for decent mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegan dumplings and vegan ramen. The dumplings were really good, flavorful and tasty, but the ramen was probably the worst bowl of soup I've ever had. I'd rather eat an unseasoned bowl of oatmeal. The ramen broth and all of the veggies and tofu just tasted like water. No flavor whatsoever, or even salt. It's great to have vegan options, but when the vegan option tastes like nothing I have to assume no one working in the kitchen has ever tried it... because there's no way they'd serve it."}
{"text":"This house-turned-restaurant has character. Though it has a tiny parking lot connected to its driveway (looks like it belongs to a house), I don't mind walking a few minutes from street parking to get here.   The saketinis are super sweet. I got the Tokyo Snow Pear, which is apparently one of the least sweet cocktails, but it was still super sweet. It wasn't my kind of drink, but it's interesting. If you're looking to try out an exotic drink, their menu has many choices.  Get the dumplings (technically potstickers)! Each of the sauces is good, and the dumplings themselves are delicious. Be warned that if you are not accustomed to using chopsticks, don't start with dumplings. To better your enjoyment, just stick to a fork with these slippery snacks.  The buns, in my opinion, are a waste of money. They don't offer that much food (~$7-8 and are pretty average). I would rather spend more money on the ramen. It's a good portion, and they know how to cook. I got the ramen with pork belly, and I couldn't get enough.   The first time I came here, I went on a weekday night and had no wait for a group of 6. However, the place gets more crowded on the weekends. I recommend calling ahead of time to see how long the wait will be."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to Umami. We went late last night. It was nice to find a place that servs food after 9:00pm. The service was fantastic! We love the dumplings...YUM! However, I must agree with other comments. The ramen was bland and wasn't hot. I like my soup hot :( The outside seating was nice. We will try Umami again."}
{"text":"Great Great food and ambience,Do not get me wrong, I travel from out of town to enjoy the food and due to the amazing experience with food last time a year ago I was here, came back for Ramen tonight. Once again food was great as tasty as ever.  Bad bad behavior from the waitresses. It was Saturday night and snowing like crazy, there was only one other couple in for dinner. We were probably the last set of guests they would have to serve. The server who would usher us in was so rude, and the rude was ridiculously rude. She literally threw a bunch of silverware on our table and a bunch of glasses of water in our faces, and sat at the bar, playing cards and laughing loudly with some dude at the bar. Sure, its snowing and you did nt want any other customers just close the place.   A second person was our server , and her attitude was pleasant but any time we asked for anything like sauce for our dumplings etc, the stare we got from her was \" Why are you being annoying house guests \". If they felt like there should no potential guests and they all wanted to go home early in the snow storm, may be they should close the place, or just stay home, as opposed to leaving bad memories of this great food place.   The pork buns are amazing as always, just the behavior of these waitresses left a bad aftertaste."}
{"text":"I'm not a Umami or Ramen or Dumpling or Noodle expert, but I do know that the food was amazing delicious and that my two year old little loved it, too.   We both had dumplings and ramen.   I was super pleased to hear that they were open late on Fridays and Saturdays as a beer and dumplings sound like the perfect night spot to me, especially in the chic, yet comfy and inviting interior.      Few small suggestions: 1) Kids menu items came pretty hot - It's a small thing, but cooling them down a bit (icecube in the ramen?) would be helpful.  I was impressed that they served all of his toppings on the side (super smart). 2) Signage outside - I'd love a bigger sign by the street - we drove right by it and didn't realize that there was a parking lot until we had already searched for awhile for street parking."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Umami three times. The food has been consistently delicious each time and the atmosphere is great. Tonight, my wife and I brought our 9 year old son along with for the first time. He has a severe sesame allergy, so we asked the staff for help choosing something safe for him to eat from their menu. They treated our request for help with seriousness and professionalism. I have recommended Umami to my friends before and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Before I get down and dirty here with my pretentious opinions, let me start by saying Umami is definitely as close to authentic ramen as you can hope to find this side of Chicago. I had the tonkotsu ramen and it was plenty good. If you've never had the real thing (or you have, and now you're jonesing hard for anything resembling it) go forth, shell out twelve bucks, and enjoy the experience (if you don't mind your beers on the warm side, enjoy it with a draft, too.) Umami is tasty, and you could really do a lot worse.  However, I have a few not-so-quibbling quibbles.   My biggest complaint concerns ramen toppings (or the lack thereof.) Umami doesn't offer any of the traditional ramen condiments you might expect with your bowl of soup if you've had ramen in Japan (or heck, even in a large American city.) If you're going to call yourself a ramen bar, you really have to offer 7-spice pepper (shichimi togarashi), pickled ginger (benishoga), and toasted sesame seeds on the table. With all due respect to Umami's right to charge a dollar for a side of sriracha and red pepper flakes, serving supposedly legit ramen without offering the 3 cardinal condiments (for free or otherwise) is kind of like opening a burger and fries joint while being unaware of the existence of ketchup. Tonkotsu ramen especially just isn't authentic without pickled ginger on the side, and the fact that Umami doesn't know this is frankly kind of weird.  Less significantly, for $12 I'm not expecting a veritable trough of ramen, but I'd at least like the bowl to be more than half full - we are talking about broth and noodles after all; this is the cheap-arse, midnight staple food of drunk salary-men, not haute cuisine.   My final verdict: Umami is imminently edible, but not remarkable. The ramen could stand a more reasonable price, given the product, and it absolutely suffers from the lack of traditional compliments, but it has passably authentic, good, deep flavor. I can recommend it once, just for the hey.  ...My water glass did smell like mouth, though."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the brunette, plain-faced hostess ruined it.  After the bartender informed me that my order had been misread by the kitchen and I was given a small and not my large order of dumpling, large to follow when ready, he asked her if he should comp me on the large upcharge, or $2.  She snarkily replied in a nasally and uptalking way, in direct earshot halfway down the bar, \"no way, absolutely not!\"  I hope she's not a manager.    She then proceeded to trash talk previous customers and generally create an intolerably annoying atmosphere for those customers unfortunate enough to be inside and in hearing distance.    When I received my bill, no accommodation of the fact that I had been inconvenienced or forced to endure that woman.   Umami, you have good food, but get your staff straightened out.  Don't hire these rude prima donnas."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends to celebrate a low-key bachelorette party. It was really good.  Folks at our table ordered a variety of dishes from spring rolls, pickled veggies, salad, dumplings, and ramen bowls. Everyone was pleased. I had a mango mojito which was excellent and everyone else who ordered a cocktail was also very pleased.  Service was straight forward and although we were a large group our checks were split on a very busy night with no fuss.  I'll go back for some dumplings and ramen."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times and I always want to like it a lot more than I actually do. The ramen is pretty tasty, and this is just about the only place to get it in Madison. However, $12 for a bowl of ramen seems a bit excessive (and an extra dollar here or there for a garlic \"bomb\" or spicy \"bomb\" adds even more). Their dumplings are pretty average. Their fruity sake cocktails are very delicious however, so maybe I'll just have to stick with those. The interior is very chic so it is a pretty classy place to get a bit tipsy."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The Ramen (miso and tonkotsu) had a rich broth with plenty of noodles and spices. There was not a huge amount of meat in either soup, but there was enough to add some pork flavor to it.  The dumplings were very tasty-- plenty of filling inside and a crispy exterior. My favorite were the pork and shrimp. They had a different flavor than the standard pork and chive, while the pork didn't overwhelm the shrimp.   The buns were probably the highlight of our meal. We had the pork belly, bulgogi, and pulled pork buns. All had great flavors, sauces, and balance of tastes. The buns were perfectly soft but still held up well beneath the fillings.   The worst part of the meal was the service. It seemed everyone in the restaurant had to wait at least an hour for their meal. I'd recommend this place for the merit of the food, but if you need a quicker meal, you probably want to go elsewhere until you have a long time to commit."}
{"text":"Going to become hooked.  Hipster-ramen atmosphere.  Waitress was attentive. Tried the spicy burrito and was AMAZING. The ramen was also outstanding. Fresh, great, full,  flavor.   Not really into the fact they lacked a variety of NON-alcoholic drinks (I understand to keep their hipster style they wouldn't enter a corporate agreement).  The matcha tea was $4 for \"unlimited\", but I noticed the second glass they made burning hot as to limit my \"unlimited\" consumption.   The $1 charge for a \"spice bomb\" (spicy chili paste concoction) was absurd to say the least. Next time I'm bringing my own hot sauce. The brunch sides were great for my child to eat at brunch.   Will return."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of ramen places in the US people have raved about, and I've yet to have any that's more balanced than the Tonkotsu Ramen at Umami. Specifically, the umami flavor isn't the most intense I've had, but they do the best job of balancing the flavor perfectly.  The location is great, being on Willy Street, and the vibe  is hip and classy without being uncomfortably so. The only real downside is that in the winter, the drafts can make it really cold for those sitting near the door, which is basically half of the restaurant.  As for other menu items, they have tea, including a matcha that could really only be described as good enough. The buns I've found to be a bit underwhelming, and a little too sweet. The serving of edamame they give you is big enough that four people would have to constantly eat them in order to finish them before the food comes. The food comes out after a reasonable time, but it's never ridiculously long or super fast. The service is variable (which you may only notice if you get a bottomless cup of matcha) in its efficiency, but always friendly.  The brunch service is definitely worth going to, as their breakfast ramen is at least as good, if not better than any of their dinner ramen."}
{"text":"Great food.  Intimate space.  Awesome sake.  Great for sharing plates.    AND THEIR BRUNCH IS AWESOME."}
{"text":"Seriously, I don't understand how the chef got onto the cover of the 'Madison' magazine.  That magazine just lost credibility in my opinion.  I'm not saying that I know everything about noodles and dumplings, but having lived in an Asian country (Korea) and eating my fair share of noodles and dumplings in others locations around the world, I have to say this place has one of the saltiest ramen I have ever eaten in my life.  The salty taste of the broth was just too overwhelming that I couldn't appreciate the flavors I would expect from ramen.   The waitstaff, drinks, and environment are very pleasant and should get high marks for that but their most important focus should be on their food in which they fail to do."}
{"text":"My fiance and I traveled from Chicago to Madison to enjoy the Labor day weekend.  After a quick search on new restaurants in the Willy St. area, I decided that we should check out Umami.  We wanted to like this place more, but the service just won't allow that to happen.  Positive: *The food - we truly enjoyed everything we ordered.  The pork buns were light and airy.  The chicken dumplings with the spicy sauce were tasty and each of our bowl's of ramen were perfectly seasoned, (the spice bomb was necessary to add that next level of heat).  *The host guy was nice and helpful and seemed like the only person to have any sense of hospitality about him.  (Our server was nice, but seemed to be reeling from a long day and didn't give any sort of personalized service).  Negative: *The service - why and how are these people working in the restaurant industry?  The bartender seemed to not only hate her job, but resent every person that walked in the door or tried to order a drink.  She never said \"hello, how can I help you?\"  Just walked up and looked at us to order a drink.  She never said \"Thank you\" or even presented a check to us.  At 8:30pm (the restaurant closed at 9pm), we saw her come out from behind the bar to tell people walking in that they weren't accepting anymore walk-in's for the night... She also repeatedly told servers to give their last call to their patrons - Maybe she had after work plans?  Because she definitely didn't want to be there any longer than she had to.  Everyone else seemed aloof or non-caring.  The restaurant industry is about hospitality, and it completely baffles me when people are hired who obviously can't stand being nice to other people.  Go for the food and opt for carry-out to save the headache."}
{"text":"Really good ramen, really good drinks, reasonable prices, and a nice patio.   One thing to keep in mind if you eat outside on the patio: there were small/medium sized spiders along the rail on the patio.  For some people, this is horrible.  I don't mind the spiders, as they aren't going to randomly attack you, and frankly, they kept flying bugs away.  But if you don't like them, stick to the inside."}
{"text":"Really yummy dumplings, including a vegan option with tofu. I also had the arugula mushroom salad, which was tasty as well (I added smoked tofu too). They have vegan ramen but I didn't try it as the bowls looked enormous and I really wanted the dumplings, but I tried a friend's broth and it was good, though not the best I've ever tried. The machta green tea is great too. Overall, I don't need to go back regularly, but definitely will next time I need a dumpling fix!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a Willy street gem. If you're up for a weekend wait, you're guaranteed one hot and delicious bowl of ramen. But, ramen isn't all this place is good for. The appetizers are killer and I think the beef buns might be one of the three things I need if I were ever stranded alone on a desert island. So definitely make a point of stopping by, and be sure to hang around for a cocktail or two."}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this place. I had heard a lot of hype (I know, the death knell for most experiences is to get sucked in my the hype) and I had pretty high expectations.  Reality was: the ramen was good, but not life-changing great as I had been told. The dumplings in my opinion were sub-par; dumpling haus has better. The buns were basic buns. The prices, in my opinion, were a bit high.  The ambiance was nice but we were seated in this room off to the side and I felt a bit isolated from the rest of the diners, which I know shouldn't be an issue, but it's kinda weird to sit alone in a room when the other part of the restaurant is buzzing with activity. Is it worth a try? Definitely. Is the food decent? Yes, certainly. Is it drastically different from other ramen places I have visited? Yes - but only in that it seems a bit more expensive than other ramen places I have been to.  However, it is the only ramen place that I am aware of in Madison - therein lies the rub!"}
{"text":"For the price, not really spectacular. Pork buns were the best but ramen too salty. We split the ramen between us but were never told it would be an extra charge. Kind of lame. Hipster vibe but without the top notch quality hipsters usually demand."}
{"text":"The pork buns alone were worth the trip, helped down by a couple of saketini (the lychee one was my favorite). The Ramen was good, not the best I've had, but overall a good experience!  A great little neighborhood gem and we're looking forward to a nice warm day so we can eat out on the front deck."}
{"text":"It's not like this is a terrible place.  I've had mixed encounters on the service.  The building is a bit smaller, but they recently extended a patio that is nice.  The food is a tad overpriced in my opinion.  This wouldn't be the end of the world, but everything seems TOO SALTY.  Dumplings, salty.  Hard boiled egg appetizer, salty.  Ramen, like drinking salt.  The menu is a limited and while the dumplings are ok, ask about a low sodium option before you order."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and enjoy some pork buns at Umami."}
{"text":"I went to umami for the first time last night with a girlfriend. The interior is very chic, and cozy. Our drinks took a while to get to the table, but the restaurant was packed so it's understandable. Despite how busy it was, service was excellent. Our waitress was funny and attentive. We were sitting by a larger group that was a bit loud for our liking, but what can you do? We had the special beef buns for an appetizer, and our waitress suggested the veggie ramen with a garlic bomb, egg, and pork belly--fantastic. The garlic bomb is amazing!! We'll be back for sure--probably sometime when it's not so crowded."}
{"text":"I typically do not write reviews on yelp BUT after my last experience I felt compelled to do so.  I have lived in the Marquette Neighborhood for about two years now and always make the effort to support our local businesses.  Umami was one of favorite places when I moved here.  Service was attentive, prompt, and cheerful.  Food was delightful.   Yet, the past few times that I have walked into the restaurant, I have been greeted with sour grapes.  I am not sure what has changed and what has prompted this new \"tude\", but it has cost you a very loyal customer.  I took my parents in for a treat the other night - a meal on Umami's patio.  We were greeted by a man, who I came to find out through inquiry, named Spike.  He could not have been more rude, more cold, nor more alienating.  He had spoken with me on the phone earlier (as I was calling to reserve a table outside) and was similarly rude.  Because of him, I decided to take my parents elsewhere.  The interior of the restaurant was entirely vacant, so I would assume that the owners of Umami would have appreciated the business.  Such a disappointment.  You are garnering a reputation for your service and it is one that cannot be balanced out by the quality of your food, Umami.  Get it together."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and to the point.  Went once, would not go back.   It probably doesn't earn three stars but it is better than two stars so I'm generously giving them three.  I had pulled pork buns, beef buns and miso ramen.  The food is overly salty, all of it.  The miso ramen is average in flavor and the noodles in the ramen taste like they are mass produced product, overall the miso ramen was subpar.    In addition to sub-average food, the kitchen and server weren't sure if shellfish was an ingredient in the pork ramen broth nor were they sure if shellfish was an ingredient in the chicken ramen broth.  This lack of ability to answer a food allergy question puzzled me when we ordered, but once I ate the poor meal it made more sense to me-apparently nobody knows nor gives a crap about what's going into the food or what's going out of the kitchen.  I lied, this is not short, the more I thought about Umami the more I was compelled to write.  Don't go, it's a 2.5 star restaurant, it sucked."}
{"text":"Great customer service by Doran He was courteous and super friendly. The food was fast and delicious.  Try the spicy pork buns!"}
{"text":"I am not a ramen fanatic, but I ate it regularly while living in Japan, which I did for many years. I've also had ramen in U.S. restaurants a handful of times.   The good news is that the pork buns and gyoza were very good (but not stellar).  The bad news is that the miso ramen really missed the mark. The soup tasted to me like they just dumped some miso into another soup base. I didn't catch any sweetness or toban-jan flavor...very, very far away from any miso ramen I have had in the U.S. or Japan. It wasn't bad per se, but they shouldn't call it miso ramen either.   Also, I got a clump of uncooked noodles in my bowl. Really. Y'know how sometimes noodles settle a little early and get stuck? This was not that. This was a large knot (about the size of an egg, but slimmer) that could not be teased apart. I pulled it out of my bowl and put it on a plate. When I cut it open with my spoon, I saw that the clump was still raw in the middle. I have never had that happen before, anywhere.   The only reason I give them two stars and not one is that the pork buns and gyoza countered some of the damage that the ramen did."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Wisconsin!  Great service and incredible food! After moving out of Madison, I have missed their food so often. I wish they would be opening one in Milwaukee area!"}
{"text":"Buns, buns, buns. Get the buns! Skip the ramen bowls and get the buns! Yum!"}
{"text":"The pork belly app is great, the dumplings are good (esp with the extra sauces), the ramen is lousy. Good service, and the Lychee saketini was delish."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Madison outdoor cafe scene. Casual and friendly. Must order the pork belly steamed buns with chef-made hoisin sauce - we ordered two and were so impressed, ordered two more. Yum! House-made gyoza have ample filling and the ramen is decent. I would recommend the tonkotsu style for its savory broth. A perfect Asian comfort food for a rainy afternoon. Beer and wine selection pretty good."}
{"text":"This ramen and dumpling house was a great find. We started off the night with beef and spicy pork buns which both were outstanding. The half moon buns were soft and sticky and the meats were tender. The beef bun had a nice crunch from the cucumber along with a great mayo based sauce, while the spicy pork buns were quite spicy but delicious. We split a miso ramen soup (which adds 1.50) but the broth was great and the noodles were not too mushy and flavorful. Overall a great experience and a fun edgy environment!"}
{"text":"The funky-looking sake bar looks a little more upscale than you'd expect otherwise for this restaurant, which specializes in yummy comfort-filled noodles, dumplings, and other delicious items.  Definitely overlook the outside of the building and give them a try.  I've encouraged meat-eaters and vegetarians alike to try them and everyone's been very happy with this choice of restaurant. The smoked tofu dumplings really embody the umami concept, while the ramen bowls are huge and savory."}
{"text":"One of my favorite date spots!  The inside is hip and cozy.  The ramen is cheap and filling.  One of my top recommendations for folks who are looking for something a little bit off the beaten trail."}
{"text":"Was in town for a random craigslist purchase from Chicago. We have some killer ramen places in Chicago so I was worried but this place is up there with some of the good ones. Don't be scared to get the bombs in your ramen. I was worried it would over power it but they give you just enough to add some good flavor to it."}
{"text":"I DIE!  the pork buns are amazing.  so good.  you must order.    the owner was there to greet us, he was so friendly and made some great suggestions for drinks.  i love that the menu is pared down - they know what they do well, and they really nailed it.  i got the veggie dumplings, so yummy.  only thing was, i felt like i could eat a million - ugh the trouble with any dumpling :)  i will definitely try to get the ramen next time and split dumplings with a friend.   also, my saketini was great.     i loved the vibe, super chic and big city feel.  i love it.  just what madison needs!"}
{"text":"My friend  agreed to explore the new place together  and i was happy we finally made it. There were many people at the time we went. Fotunately there was a table for two on the patio left for us. So we had a nice fresh atmosphere with tasty dinner. Just perfect!   Foods and service were good. Our waiter was nice and had the service mind. I had tonkutsu ramen bowl and pork buns. They were so good. The ramen soup was not salty (even my friend  who is really sensitive  to the salty had no soup left in her bowl)and the noodles were soft and plenty. I love the pieces of pork in my bowl. I definitely  want to come back there again. Thanks  a lot to serve this kinds of ramen in Madison."}
{"text":"Just ok, heavy on the salt and spices. Had ramen, pork buns and dumplings. Dumplings came out either undercooked or over-dried, the dough was still a little too hard. Broth needed more depth, more umami, less salt. I could not drink enough water, though my glass was only filled once. My martini was more room temp than chilled, and since I was eating at the bar and saw a icy well-shaken one get served next to me, I had to ask for ask for a re-shake. The space was charming."}
{"text":"I reviewed this restaurant and interviewed the owners for the upper midwest food magazine the \"Heavy Table\" in honor of Umami's 1 yr anniversary.   It is now a year later and I am still thinking about some of the dishes I ate, and plotting a trip back to Madison.  While the ramen (especially with the amazing \"flavor infused\" egg!) and the paper thin, crispy dumplings were delicious; the top dishes on MY mind are:  1. The only seafood on the menu, tuna poke ($10), is a must. Sashimi-grade ahi tuna is served with seaweed salad and apple cucumber slaw in a sweet soy sauce, atop crispy pork rinds. It's a balanced bite of salty / sweet and crispy / meaty each time.  2. The pork buns ($7) feature roasted, thick, juicy pieces of Berkshire pork belly and pickled vegetables in a homemade hoisin sauce stuffed inside a fluffy steamed gwa pao bun (Taiwanese clamshell style). If you prefer spicy over sweet, try the ones filled with Korean beef.   3. Finally, although you are sure to be full, the green tea cr√®me brulee ($6) is a flavorful end to a savory meal.

{"text":"I ate at Umami on Wednesday, May 1, 2013.   FOOD 3/5 I ordered tea, a summer roll appetizer, and dumplings. Below are the menu items I ordered, with my opinion of each.  \"Summer roll  $5 assorted vegetables, peanuts, sesame, herbs and tofu wrapped in rice paper with spicy peanut sauce\" The summer roll was very pretty, but also very bland. I didn't detect any significant quantity of herbs or seasonings, and 90% of the filling was plain white cabbage. The peanut sauce was acceptable, but I've certainly had better.  \"Dumplings (six for $6 / nine for $8) choice of one sauce per order: soy vinegar, sweet or spicy sauce -- pork and chives, the classic, with Taiwanese cabbage, Chinese chives, and ginger\" The dumplings were very good. The balance of filling to wrap was just right, and they were browned on one side, providing both the taste of a fried dumpling along with the soft texture of steamed dough. I wanted to order a variety of dumplings (ideally three of each kind) but that is not allowed, so I only got one type.  \"Tea\" It was served in a pretty 4 oz cup, extremely hot. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it was a Japanese style green tea. (It's frustrating to eat at an Asian restaurant and have European tea, or Lipton, and they didn't do that.) I would have preferred a small pot with my tiny cup, or failing that a medium sized cup.  SERVICE 1/5 I found the service to be severely lacking.   When I entered the establishment, it was early in the evening and there were only 2-3 customers. The first employee I saw simply looked at me and walked behind the bar. The second simply looked at me. After being stared at for a few seconds, I said, \"I'd like a table, please\" and she said, \"OK.\" After a few more seconds of standing there silently I said, \"For one\" and she said, \"OK\" and lead me to a table. During this conversation a number of other employees hung around behind the bar having a personal discussion. I certainly don't begrudge employees some personal talk while business is slow, but I mention it because the unenthusiastic hostess and preoccupied staff combined to give the impression that my visit was rather a burden.   After I was seated a waitress asked my left shoulder what I would like to drink. (I may be exaggerating a bit when I say that she was speaking to my shoulder, but when sitting alone at a table with no other people or furniture in the way, I rather expect anyone speaking to me to stand somewhat in front of me, aim their body in my general direction, and look roughly toward me. I think the only time I saw her face was when she eventually brought me a bill.) I was driving and not planning to drink alcohol, so I asked if soft drinks were on the menu. The waitress said, \"Yes. No. We have coke products.\" I asked for tea, which she agreed to, but later discovered that they carry specialty sodas and other nonalcoholic beverages.  I would have liked some more tea, which I didn't get. I would have liked some more water, which I didn't get. I would have liked a bowl of ramen, which I didn't bother to order since I didn't really feel welcome.  (Edit: I did receive what I ordered, and I did leave a 15% tip.)  ATMOSPHERE 3/5 The building, decor, lighting, etc. are pleasant and attractive. While my preference may be for Japanese music, the indie rock they played was unobtrusive, inoffensive, and commercial free. Most important, the volume was just right, audible, but not so loud that it would overpower conversation.  PRICE 3/5 Prices are exactly what I would expect for this type of restaurant in this location. Happy hour from 5:00-7:00 Monday-Thursday offers 2 for 1 beer, sake, and rails.  OTHER The menu includes clearly labeled vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free items in each category. Parking is available on site (not the case for most businesses in this neighborhood) as is a bike rack.  Despite my lackluster first impression, I'd like to try Umami again someday. I like their menu, and by all accounts their ramen is very good. It's possible that I simply visited at a bad time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the veggie ramen here while in town visiting a college friend.  It was delicious, and now I'm motivated to seek out some good ramen spots in Boston!  There were numerous vegetarian options, fun add-in's for your ramen (like a \"shot\" of hot sauce or an infused egg), and the interior was pleasant - a mix of trendy and homey, I'd say."}
{"text":"There are a few places in Madison that have dishes that I crave. The ramen at Umami is one of them. Order a spicy bomb for a kick. The dumplings are fantastic, too. Try the cocktail with Maker's Mark and green tea. I forget the name, but it's a really nice combo."}
{"text":"The veggie dumplings with a trio of sauce are excellent! The veggie ramen with a spicy bomb and garlic bomb is wonderful and we got some fantastic smoked tofu for some extra protein. The ramen could be a meal for two, packed with delicious, locally-made noodles and seasonal veggies. I can't wait to try out the patio and see if summer brings new dishes for cool weather, maybe soba? I'm a little sad that there aren't any tofu buns on the menu that I've seen in other cities. Those buns are addictive - 6 stars if they end up on the menu!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to Umami for a year or so now and have never had a bad experience. I consider myself an adventurous eater and everything I have had so far is excellent. The seating is best during the summer as the deck is comfortable and much more fun that sitting inside. In the winter/fall when the close the deck the wait can get a little long, which may be my only concern. We waited for nearly an hour one night, but we stuck it out, which should say a lot."}
{"text":"The flavor infused egg that is served in most of the ramen dishes is the bomb dot com. The pork/beef/tofu buns are nothing to sneeze at, the dumplings are appropriately dumpling-like, the drinks are drinkable.... But really my ability to qualitatively process anything else that is served at this establishment is disrupted by how hard I am jonesing for a flavor infused egg. It's a serious can't-miss."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! I've been here for their brunch and for dinner. I couldn't tell any difference between the two ramen types but thought they were both exactly what I expected. Parking can be a bit tight on Willy St but it's worth it 100%"}
{"text":"Went with girlfriend to share some plates and we were so delighted by our server Dorren. He was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and beyond and also attentive. We loved our meal and cocktails, especially the pork buns, dumplings, and mochi ice cream!! The ramen was ok; the soft boiled egg with soy yolk was delicious"}
{"text":"I will definitely give a 0 star if there is an option but I have to give a star to submit this thing. We ordered miso and tonkatsu ramen and it took them 30 minutes to serve. Tonkatsu ramen has a horribly stinky smell, like the smell of a piece of meat that has been in the car trunk for 5 days. Not fresh pork.  Miso ramen was okay but the soup was too salty, and the chicken was overboiled like a piece if gum. I don't recommend... Okay, just don't have tonkatsu and miso ramen here."}
{"text":"Blah blah blah. I went here and had the pork buns, pork dumplings, pickled vegetables, and miso ramen. Not a single thing was worth the money and I don't plan on going back to see if there's anything else on the menu I would like. A ramen restaurant that can't even get ramen right is sad. Seriously the soup had very little flavor at all which was surprising considering everyone on here said it was so salty. I borrowed my friend's garlic bomb and it didn't help at all. All of the ingredients were subpar which is not acceptable given the price. There's something wrong when you can't tell the difference between bamboo and chicken in look, texture, or taste. They just throw in a chunk junk seaweed that was tasteless.  All of the sprouts were broken and looked old. No one at the table was satisfied with their soup.  The dumplings were just fine. Not great but by far the best thing ordered.  The pork buns I saw featured in the Isthmus food issue (maybe?) or one of the Madison magazines. Dough was stiff and dry, meat had an odd taste, way too much hoisin, and I think there were also pickled cucumbers in there that made these things taste like dessert. Exactly what I wanted....dessert pork belly. I feel like never ordering pork belly in this town again since everyone thinks that as long as the dish has pork belly you don't have to make sure anything else actually tastes good.   We want good tastes with good ingredients...not this overpriced garbage. Seriously, look at the pictures people have posted and see if it even looks good. I promise it tastes worse than it looks.    Also, apparently they can't split the check because their machines aren't capable of doing it and even though it was very clear we were two couples the waitress never mentioned it. Weak."}
{"text":"Unique little spot here in Madison.  A friend led us here on a cold wintery night.  We had the steam bun's which were a perfect start.  After looking around, I thought to myself that an entire bowl of ramen would be too much, but I was wrong.  I ate every last drop.  The flavors bursted in your mouth and all the ingredients paired well with each other.  I live on the West Side but I'm already counting down the days until we return.  Good job Umami."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Food and drinks are great! Service is excellent! The outside area is nice. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  However, although we had a full hour until Umami closed, our waiter rushed us through every course of our meal.   A few minutes to closing, white lights were turned on. Minutes later those lights were turned on full and we were given the Bum's Rush.  Last summer I  experienced curt employees at Umami, so it will be a long while before I try them again. It's unfortunate that the service is lacking in sensitivity  because the food is quite good."}
{"text":"Definitely stick to the pork broth ramen; it's much better seasoned. That said, you get plenty of dinner for the average order and the spicy sauce is great with dumplings. Don't shy away from the nori in your bowl. It's there for a reason!"}
{"text":"I *love* Umami.  Let me count the ways:  1.  Even when we get food (dumplings, buns) to go, they are amazingly delicious!  Somehow still hot when I get home, tasty, in-tact, perfect.  2.  Easy for everyone from vegans to omnivores to eat here.  3.  Great service.  4.  Good portion size."}
{"text":"Japanese food fanatic here--my last meal on earth will be Japanese cuisine!!. Also been to Japan a few times and currently going through withdrawals lol.  Went on a Friday night and ordered the tonkotsu ramen. Finally a ramen restaurant in Madison that doesn't serve soft soggy \"instant\" noodles. The noodles were at least a bit more firm. Personal preference is close to al dente.  And the broth. Honestly, it was just meh. The flavor itself was pretty unidimensional and the consistency is way too thick--reminds me more of a curry broth than a ramen broth. I usually like my tonkotsu broth to be much thinner, richer in flavor content, and on the gelatinous side.  The braised pork was pretty good, however they are sliced very thin--so I would recommend asking for an additional topping. The bamboo was quite good, a bit more sour than I am used to, but still tasty. A few pieces were a bit more difficult to chew though.   The true star of the dish was the egg. This is the first thing I look at for ramen--if its overcooked then I know this ramen isn't up to par. They did a good job cooking it to the right temperature and seasoning it was soaked in was spot on. Only problem is that there was only 1/2 of the egg?! I don't understand why a full egg isn't present :(  Service: was quick and efficient. Friendly staff. Environment: dined inside. Cute and cozy.  Overall, pretty good ramen place for Madison, WI."}
{"text":"First off, I love ramen and would take the chance to visit every ramen shop I ran into.  Because of this, I've been able to experience many different types of ramen around the country.  This doesn't make me a ramen expert by no means but I know what I like.  Umami is hidden away in a little \"house\" right off of Willy street.  The sign is very small and you can easily miss it, but it's located pretty much across from \"Plan B\".  They sell ramen and dumplings just like the name suggests.  We ended up order 2 types: $12 for a bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen and $10 for the miso ramen.  We also ordered the pork and chives dumplings, 6 for $6.  Now ramen prices are usually pricey like this, so we didn't think too much of it.  We received the dumplings first. They were small, pan friend on the outside, and came with a soy-ginger dipping sauce.  These dumplings were tasty, but I wish there was more to it.  More meat, more chives, more anything.  The ramen came next.  This was maybe 30 minutes after we received the dumplings. With that said, the service there was reallllllll slow.  For a place that only sells ramen, you'd expect to get your food a little faster.  The ramen tasted good, but like the dumplings, there wasn't much to it.  You got half an egg, a couple pieces of chasu pork, and some of the pickled bamboo shoot.  I wouldn't say I'm a gluten, but I wish there was MORE food, especially since it was a 45-60 min wait since we made our order...I was hungry.   Overall, very good food, but not necessarily for the price.  You can add extra ingrediants to you noodles, but that would make a bowl of noodles cost upwards of $20, something I'm not willing to pay."}
{"text":"Okay food. Edible. But nowhere close to good ramen or dumplings. Fusion japanese food. Many other much better japanese restaurants in madison."}
{"text":"Giving it 3 stars for overall atmosphere and the potential the place has, but based on our actual dining experience, I'd probably give it a 2. They are working out the kinks, but overall I'd say less salt (on everything) and tighter service. I was also a bit surprised at the prices. Ramen is generally an inexpensive food, but the prices here are a bit high."}
{"text":"Yep. Underwhelming. The noodles weren't very good (I had the tonkotsu ramen, but I thought they were ok (my two friends didn't think they were ok). Dumplings were ok as well. Neither, I thought, were worth the price. I've bought their pork buns at their food cart on campus too, and I was like \"seriously? $7 for this little food?\" I mean, it wasn't bad, but they can only charge that much because we're in Nothingtown. The only thing I liked was the green tea creme brulee; that one was really good."}
{"text":"Umami is my favorite place to get together with friends when I visit Madison. The food is unique to the area and always good. Plus, I can't make the dumplings at home."}
{"text":"The Good: the atmosphere was modern, unique, and intimate.  The flavored egg added to the veggie ramen.  The drinks were great-Tokyo pear and Hanami. The Okay: The food.  The dumplings were good not great.  The ramen was not salty enough and the veggie ramen had no protein without adding the egg for a cost.  $12 for veggie ramen seemed pricey.  If there had been soy sauce available or the waitstaff more attentive, it would not have been a problem.  The thai summer rolls were good, but the peanut sauce they were served with was not that spicy, savory, sweet mix that tastes so go. The Bad:  The service.  We sat at the bar, the bartender was visibly stressed and running around making it unenjoyable to sit there.  It was not overly busy for dinner on a Saturday night (empty seats at the bar and restaurant).  We were not offered water or chopsticks, we would \"bus\" our own dishes by putting them on top of the bar when we were done to get the attention of the bartender.  When I asked what type of dumplings they served, I was told pot stickers, then the bartender said no, gave an elaborate explanation to which I asked if they were gyoza.  She said no and then brought gyoza.  It seems that a japanese restaurant's staff should know what they are serving."}
{"text":"Dissapointing.  Buns, dumplings, and ramen are all mediocre.  Deffinitely not worth return visit."}
{"text":"We had our dinner here when we made a trip travelled to UW Madison. This place is trendy and relaxable. We were here during restaurant week so it's a little bit slow. Dumplings are really good. Ramen are not as good as wasabi in Chicago."}
{"text":"The ramen is not cheap as others have said, and 12 dollars does seem like a lot for the simple ingredients.  However, it is tasty, and as someone who craves ramen a lot, its awesome to have a \"healthy\" ramen option in town to stop me from eating maruchan ramen. That being said, the BUNS are AMAZING.  They are also not cheap, 7 dollars for 2 small ones, but wow they are so good.  You can also get these buns at umami's food cart in library mall, usually there monday-friday.  I highly recommend the pulled pork buns, which have a peach-miso sauce (they say chutney, I say sauce). Will certainly be eating more of these buns in the future, but wouldnt go running back for the ramen (I had the miso chicken ramen), which is ironic because I had originally gone there for the ramen with no intention of trying the buns."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by the watery tasteless broth of the tonkatso ramen. It was severely lacking in fattiness and (more importantly) flavor. The pork bun had a nice mantou style wrapper but the pork was unevenly salted resulting in a super salty bite followed by a blander but better balanced ratio of wrapper, sauce, and meat. I wasn't expecting LA caliber authenticity but the miso soup from trader joes is tastier than the offering here."}
{"text":"A wait of 45 minutes is too long even if the food might be good. Sorry. Lousy experience"}
{"text":"I went to Umami right when they opened today with a party of 5 and only 3 of us were present at the moment. I asked for seating outside but was told we could not be seated until the rest of our party arrived or she could just seat us inside. This still doesn't make sense to me because in that time we would of ordered MORE drinks and MORE appetizers while waiting than with no table. In the end we missed out on sitting at the patio and sat inside. Our table ordered summer rolls and a seaweed salad. The summer rolls were a bit bland but I enjoyed the seaweed salad and mushrooms. As for the ramen, both the pork and chicken were very tasty and the broth was rich and salty but I am not sure that I will return."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Madison this is the one place I must go to every time, if not twice! The ambiance is nice and relaxing, was able to get a patio spot last time which was very nice. Patio is a nice size and is great on a nice day. The service has been great all times I've been, very polite, attentive and timely. The food never lets me down, dumplings are great and come with a couple diff dipping sauces, all the ramens are good but my fav is the tonkotsu. The pork buns are interesting, veering away from the normal bun style and is more like a wrap or taco. They added a few new types as well which haven't tried yet. Only complaint so far is that they replaced the apple walnut frisee salad!"}
{"text":"We have been there for brunch and dinner, both were fantastic. Great service. The dumplings were delicious as was the ramen. The mixtures of flavor that they create is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Don't know what took me so long to try this place considering I lived down the street. Cool environs, great service, and delicious food. The summer rolls and dumplings were top notch on ingredient quality, preparation, presentation and taste! Prices are very good for the quality and quantity you get. Two for one drinks at happy hour can't be beat.   My only qualm was the taste of the chicken in the ramen, but I don't think I'm a ramen person. I'll stick to summer rolls and dumplings next time, which will hopefully be soon."}
{"text":"Picture your perfect day...blue skies, a walk near the lake, you want a shady spot in the afternoon to eat with excellent people-watching. Step right up to Umami and enjoy the spicy pork buns and classic pork dumplings on their front patio.  Wash it all down with some delicious mango mojitos...you're set!"}
{"text":"I agree with the general consensus, it's a happy 3 1/2 star place.   We got the beef buns, pork and vegetable pot stickers,  and tonkatsu ramen.   The beef buns (2) were flavorful and good portion, I just wish they were a tad bit warmer.   With the pot stickers (9), you get a choice of one of the sauces. We mistakenly chose the sirracha, expecting it to be soy sauce based,  instead it was a paste. I'd go with the soy sauce next time. The filings were fair but the wrapper was too thick.   We split the ramen and we're glad we did because it was a huge bowl. There was sufficient ramen, bamboo shoots and thin pork slices. It's definitely not your traditional ramen in the sense that they did not use juicy pork belly, and the soup base was very light. Did not have the deep flavor of a true tonkatsu ramen."}
{"text":"Being summer I went there because it's the only place that reportedly sells Hiyashi Chuka which is a cold ramen soup.  I ordered it with extra noodles which usually is an extra charge of a dollar at most places. I was told before ordering it is $12. I had no drink, just water. When it came there was no soup in the dish. I was told it was a \"dry noodle dish\". In Japan the toppings are relatively standard, and differences in flavor are the noodles or broth. This lacked classic toppings of egg, ham, tomatoes, nori, but it did have cucumber. It usually has a dollop of hot yellow mustard on the side of the dish you can mix with the sweet soup to give it some kick. Of course no soup. They did give me some hot broth. I then had to ask for ice for the broth as it is a cold dish. Also, the soup is supposed to be a clear sweet broth, and they give me a miso broth. I made do with the alterations and would have given a higher rating as the waitress was accommodating. But the dish had red pepper on it. Not a problem, except the sliced pepper had pieces of sticker on it which made me think it wasn't washed. I expected a bill of about $14, but it was over $20, probably because when I ordered she asked if I wanted tofu or chicken--and I assume neither was included and she failed to tell me it was an extra charge. After I left I went to work--a 20 min drive. Once I arrived I started feeling queezy. About an hour after arriving to work I was in the bathroom vomiting.  After vomiting I started feeling better which led me to believe it was the food."}
{"text":"As the only ramen restaurant in downtown Madison, I'm very happy to have Umami in the city. I go there at least a few times a month, but I can't say I LOVE the experience. I have not had great experience with the wait staff (friendly but not that attentive and also seem to busy). The bar staff is wonderful, however.   I think that the ramen is decent (very noodle-heavy with only a hint of the other ingredients on the list of each dish). It's just not that creative and the food, while you can order it spicy, isn't the most flavorful. Brunch menu is a little more creative with some fun fusion of American-style breakfast items (eggs, bacon, etc.) and asian dishes like the dumplings, buns, and ramen. The Umami bloody is FANTASTIC.  Overall, a solid restaurant with some fun, funky decor but room for improvement."}
{"text":"Restaurant week review:  I've known of Umami for years but just never really gotten around to trying it, so I figured this would be the time.  I started with a pork belly bun, and it was pretty standard in that the pork belly was fatty, the scallions were fresh, and the pickled vegetables were present, too. The bun itself, however, was strangely dried at the edges and wasn't super pillowy like other baos I've had.  Dumplings were yummy; I had the shrimp and pork, and these were something I would consider coming back for. Not too oily, good filling, and crispy.  For my main, I went for the tonkatsu ramen, which I felt was underwhelming compared to the other bowls of ramen I've had in Madison: the broth was too salty, the noodle texture was kind of mushy, and the bamboo was tough to chew. The fermented egg was my winner in this bowl.  I ended my meal with green tea mochi; it was the right amount of sweet and a nice way to end the meal. I probably won't come back because of my preferences of buns, ramen, and dumplings elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been told to try something twice, so I did. I really want to love this place.  I love noodles. I love meat. I love soup. I love dumplings.    The dumplings were probably the highlight of both meals and just OK. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.   The cocktails are serviceable, but definitely not the best in town.    The star of the show should be the ramen, but both times it fell flat.  I had the tonkatsu on my first visit, and compared to other ramen the broth seemed a little thin and a bit too salty.  The shoyu ramen fared better, but still lacked the richness I would expect out of a ramen restaurant.  I thought the noodles were strange, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Perhaps a little too big and chewy.  I really want to like you, Umami, I really do. There's just not enough umami for me. Fix up the broth and the noodles and maybe I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has surprisingly good ramen, given that it's in the middle if the Midwest. Coming from California, it was a bit disconcerting to be in a Japanese restaurant and not see a single Asian worker, but I guess that's just the way it is in the Midwest.   I have been twice in two different trips to Madison, and the ramen was consistent both times. Not overly salty, decent depth to the broth, and springy noodles, not mushy or soggy. Edemame we good, slightly too salty, though. The poke salad was fresh, and I lived to tell about it the next day... Always a good thing when dealing with raw fish.   Bathroom was clean (always a plus) and the drink menu was pretty extensive, though I only had a beer."}
{"text":"Oh snaps y'all... There is a good ramen shop in Madison. My husband and I wanted some ramen to warm us up and this place delivered! We had the brunch ramen which was packed with wonderful flavors that hit the spot!  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. The noodles were amazing and the drinks as well. I enjoyed the mango mojito, it was fresh and just prepared to perfection. Next time I am in Madison I will definitely hot this place up. Service was also great!!!"}
{"text":"As someone who has been to Japan, and is educated on ramen, let me tell you how surprised I was with the superior quality of their tonkatsu ramen. The broth is buttery and amazing. I recommend adding the shiitake mushrooms. Go here!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe at Unami.  It was a fun place to try.  We all thought the food was good, especially the dumplings.  I'm usually a beer kinda guy, but their cocktails intrigued me so I tried a couple - both were very good.  The Tonkotsu ramen was delicious (although salty), which is their signature ramen.  It's a small restaurant, so large groups are likely not ideal.  Our group of 5 worked out just fine.  We would certainly try this place again."}
{"text":"Hailing from LA/OC, I have pretty high standards when it comes to ramen and I eagerly awaited the opening of Umami. I made it for a weekday lunch. As other reviewers have already stated, the space is very nice/New York chic with a completely new interior and classy bar.   The dinner menu looked very similar to the lunch menu and I am assuming that the only difference is really the portion size of the ramen. The cocktail (sake-tini) menu looked quite impressive with classic and original sake-tini recipes. I can't say anything about how they tasted though since it was not quite yet noon when I dropped by, but I will have to return to taste them. The sake list had a nice selection with reasonable price points for glasses/350/500 mL bottles. It's nice to know that there is another place to get good sake in town that is not Sushi Muramoto or Restaurant Muramoto.   What I ordered was the salad (mushroom and arugula) and ramen (tonkotsu) lunch portion. They came out quite promptly and the ramen was steaming hot.   The salad was fresh and crisp, but a bit overdressed. All in all it was somewhat forgettable.   The bowl of ramen was quite inviting, but I was left a bit wanting. First the positive: The noodles had a hearty and toothsome chew and were cooked well. Their \"flavor infused egg\" had a delightful texture and custardy interior. The chashu was well prepared, but with two very thin (almost deli-meat thickness) cuts, the flavor of roast pork didn't quite shine in comparison with the rich broth.   This brings me to the broth...Don't get me wrong, their version of tonkotsu is rich, but richness from the fat/collagen of high temperature boiled bones can not make up for a lack of well...umami...At times I had thought that I accidentally ordered shio (salt) ramen. I did not have an issue with the level of saltiness with this broth. The flavors were just too clean for me to be a tonkotsu. Perhaps next time I would recommend the \"garlic bomb\" extra for their tonkotsu. Additionally for the reviewers that are commenting on the lack of umami perhaps, try out their miso-ramen, that's what I'm going to do as miso paste should add quite a bit of umami and deepness to the broth.   The staff are quite friendly and young. Also the service was attentive and prompt.   Overall I would give Umami a 3/5 for lunch, but I will return for dinner service and try out their cocktails, sake, and smaller bites and give an updated review. We all deserve second chances right?"}
{"text":"Best ramen and dumplings in madison, hands down! The smoked tofu is amazing, the tofu buns are as well. I've only tried the chicken & mushroom dumplings and the veggie dumplings, after coming here countless times, I still get the same thing every time and it never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Madison. I've lived here a long time, and they have the best dumplings in the city. Pork buns, ramen, you name it- you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Ambiance and server were great! Food took a little longer than we had hoped for but it was a packed Saturday night. Spicy pulled pork buns and pork dumplings with spicy sauce were very tasty! Miso Ramen was good although I'm no connoisseur  but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Umami is located in a converted house on Willy Street.The inside is much larger than it looks from the outside.Of the three Ramen places I have tried this is some of the best, the pork buns have nice size chunks of goodness,beef buns are tasty! There is a small amount of parking in the back."}
{"text":"The wife and I met my brother and sister-in-law for dinner here last week, and I was pretty impressed with Umami. Since moving to Madison, I've been consistently surprised at how many ethnic joints there are in town, and it was fun to find this place tucked in amongst the other great stores/restaurants on Willy St. I realllllllllllllllllllly wanted to give this five stars, but I try and reserve that for only truly fantastic places. Umami is *so close*, but the service we had made it only \"great\" and not \"spectacular.\"  The restaurant itself is an interesting set-up, as it seems to be an old house, renovated into a \"hip\" restaurant/bar. I'm always a big fan of outdoor seating, so I was pleased that we were able to snag a table outside on a nice summer night.   Looking at other reviews, it seems like people had trouble with service. Our waitress was just okay. I think my experience with her was tainted after being very impressed by the service of a waiter/host inside (maybe he was the manager?). The four of us wanted to get out of our comfort zones and order new things/authentic drinks & dishes, so it was important for us to be able to have stuff recommended to us. Whoever the guy was inside hooked me up with a delicious drink (O-cha Mark) but the waitress didn't seem to know much about the menu.  GOOD: - Decent selection of beer/cocktails - The ramen itself was quite tasty. I'm used to the cheap variety, so I was pleasantly surprised with the way it should actually taste. The flavor-infused egg was delicious as well! Get the Spicy Bomb to add. - The dumplings. OHHHHHHHH the dumplings. We tried two kinds (pork, chicken) and they were fantastic. - By far my favorite were the pork & beef buns. Holy crap were they tasty, especially when you mix in their sweet&sour or spicy sauces.  BAD: - Service was fair (at best)"}
{"text":"My fiancee, brother and his wife ate here last night and it was absolutely amazing! We ordered buns, dumplings, and ramen, everything we had was extremely delicious! Our waiter (Dorin) was awesome! He really took his time to explain to us everything on the menu. I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Despite my dietary restrictions of soy and egg, Umami still allowed me to have a very enjoyable dinner! Now, that being said, i was very limited with items on the menu. I was impressed with their flexibility.   My boyfriend raves about their pork buns. This was something i was unable to try, but worth noting.  We shared an order of spring rolls (minus tofu) with peanut sauce. Awesome! I had the pork/shrimp dumplings (favorite thing), chicken/mushroom dumplings and the original ramen with pork belly added. YUM YUM YUM!  Most items on there menu are $5-$12 each. For a date night with 2 drinks, 1 app, pork buns, 2 dumplings and a shared order of ramen...with tip, or our total was $90.   I would recommend coming here, but i will not be back for a while...too many other cool places to try in the area first!"}
{"text":"Love the Asian fusion BRUNCH! Ramen is alright.   It is a cute little place with a fun patio you could hang out at when the weather is good. Design is adorable and modern Japanese. Love the artwork - both paintings and wall.   The seats are limited, you can probably seat up to 30 without the patio and an additional of 20 with the patio  The drinks are delicious, adapted from a popular New York Japanese joint Morimoto. White ice - delicious adult version of calpico, definitely for one with a sweet tooth and enjoys little alcohol taste in the drink.   The brunch has been a refreshing addition to Madison's wide selection. Omu rice is amazing - egg over sticky rice with Chinese sausage and ham. Some kind bbq sauce over. You can't really stop your bites. Biscuit and tonkatsu sauce is a savory delish. There's no pork cutlet in there but the sauce is made of the tonkatsu broth from ramen. Biscuits are not crispy but very nice touch there! The eggs are a nice top layer. We also tried the BELT bun as well. Not my fave. Would probably stick to pork buns.   Finally, I would stay away from Thai ice tea - it is not sweet and taste more like iced tea, straight. It costs 50 cents to get more condensed milk too. Also ramen is just not my type - they had RP pasta make their noodles, which is awesome, but the texture is not chewy enough. I do really enjoy the ramen egg - very well done, runny and flavored. Broth is alright. Reasonable.   Definitely looking forward to return and try the brunch again! Hurray Asian fusion brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty great place on Willy Street with cool decoration. Looks like a tiny house. You enter from the side and can sit at the bar or a bunch of little platforms within.  Fare is Asian fusion but without the yuppiness or over-the-top decor of many such places. I had the pork buns, pork and chive dumplings, and pork ramen. Pork buns were sublime. I felt like I was eating a lightly melted stick of butter, only made out of pork!!! So tender and melt-in-mouthish. I'm still thinking about it. Pork and chive dumplings were dope, too. They came out really hot and super flavorful, great balance between the pork and the chive. Weirdly, the least impressive of the three was the ramen itself. A bit too much sodium for my taste, plus I wish the cuts of meat were thick (like in the appetizers) not thinly sliced. It definitely wasn't bad -- don't get me wrong -- but I'd actually stick to the non-ramen parts of things.  Desert was dope; some of it comes from Madison Sourdough across the street. I'm not gonna step on the scale tonight!!!"}
{"text":"My children and I went here for lunch on a weekend. It is a very small place so expect a little waiting time.   This was our first time here so we ordered a variety of dishes to try. The ramen noodle dishes we ordered were forgetable. It lacked flavor and I probably would never order it again should I go back. We tried the different bao buns and the pork belly ones were definitely the most flavorful. Probably the only thing that will take me back to this place."}
{"text":"Reminds me of chic ramen joints in NYC. The house is stylish and modern and makes you feel like you're in a bigger city. simple, but interesting menu. Good ramen. Great service. They are adding a deck which should be nice.   Not as good as Muramoto, but a great and fairly unique addition to the Madison food scene."}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow.  Ambiance was perfect.  Service was perfect (gaaaaaah, wish I had remembered our server's name... blonde, female, piercings... if the owners read this she seriously needs to be congratulated on being outstanding in every way.  Accommodating, informed, funny).  Patio looked lovely but after an 86 degree day of being outside, we decided to sit inside for some much needed a/c.  Mango mojito made me forget all about the  heat.  Tuna Poke appetizer was FABULOUS.  Ahi Tuna melted in your mouth, blended well with the apple cucumber slaw. Loved my Tonkotsu Ramen Pork dish.  Can't wait to go a second round with all my leftovers tomorrow!  After reading the complaints on pricing, I can say I felt juuuuuuust fine with the price for the service and quality of food.  Full belly+amazingness+stellar service=satisfied girl."}
{"text":"Because of the great reviews I though I should try this place out. It was not as great as I expected but it was okay. I ordered the Shoyu dish. The noodles could of been softer and there could of been less chives. I'm not a fan of seaweed so I just pulled it out as the waitress served it. I loved how the meat were thinly sliced and I got a good amount of it. It came with corn which was interesting but not bad.   The location wasn't bad. They have parking in the back but I wouldn't bother with it. Not enough stalls and I believe the cars belonged to some of the workers. We parked on the street. It wasn't difficult for me to find the restaurant because I was expecting it to be difficult according to some of the reviews.   Overall, it i went in with too high of hopes. I wouldn't think of going back just because i don't want to pay more then $8 for a bowl of noodles. I would go only go back if I went with someone who wanted to try it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Love the korean barbeque buns and poke appetizer. Found the trailer on State Street and then went to the restaurant. Can't say enough about the food!!"}
{"text":"We had brunch on Sunday. The steamed buns were so good!! We also had the steamed dumplings - so yummy! Service was fantastic. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings. Had shrimp and pork....yum. Had the mushroom salad and it complemented the dumplings perfectly. Good two for one drinks til 7pm. Gracious owner from my neck of the woods, Queens. A lovely neighborhood vibe. Bring the kids. That's okay too."}
{"text":"I have just moved to Madison, and went there for my first night in downtown Madison. The restaurant looks like a house from the outside, which is very adorable. There is a private lot for parking, but not with a lot of spaces. I had the spicy tofu buns, which were delicious, and the veggie ramen. The veggie ramen was ok. I wish I had gotten the pork or chicken miso now, since the veggie did not have as much flavor as I thought. Overall a good experience and I recommend it for a peaceful dinner when cold."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, yet memorable Japanese ramen, Chinese dumplings and pork buns in a house turned restaurant. They serve up some decent cocktails. The weekend brunch is actually my favorite.   Atmosphere is very casual and, at times, loud. The service is typically decent, but occasionally an odd, overly-open server will leave you wondering what happened in his childhood."}
{"text":"Umami has wonderful buns. They taste great, and who doesn't want to meet friends at a place where you can make semi witty jokes about buns.  They only take reservations for 6+ so all the more reason to make this your dinner with friends spot.  The atmosphere is great. It is cute and hipster, so everything you want from Willy Street.  I don't exactly see eating lots of hot carbs and then wanting to dance, but it is right across the street from Plan B, so I suppose if that sounds appealing to you, it would be awfully convenient."}
{"text":"Wonderful pork dumplings and ramen bowls. There is not that much room so if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared for a wait. The wait staff is very helpful and friendly. They are also very creative with their special Ramen bowls."}
{"text":"We know the food is good - but not the service!  Hostess was herding us around the restaurant  and table seating was an impossible wait.  It wasn't an \"off day\"- this was a repeat performance from her.  Life is too short to eat here, carry those ramen out!"}
{"text":"soup is too salt, bad service. But Ramen is cool. We 11 went there for dinner, they have outdoor sittings, great to go in 3 or 4."}
{"text":"3 stars because:  Food = wonderful! Six stars.  Service = not as wonderful; thoroughly disinterested with everything. Zero stars, maybe one to be nice.   First the positive. The food here is consistently great! I get the vegan ramen with a garlic bomb and spicy tofu buns most of the time. Got it again this time and was super happy. Flavors were complex and perfect in the broth, buns were pillows of perfection. Others had good experiences with the food as well.   I recently went for dinner with friends for a celebration. Let me set the stage. It was a rainy Thursday much like today. The restaurant was not crowded at any point during our visit. I think it may have been during UWs spring break.   We mentioned the reason for our visit when booking the reservation and again upon arrival. Most humans would say something like \"congratulations\" or \"why are you excited about that? literally no on cares\" but at every step the Umami staff somehow managed to ignore us entirely. We weren't looking for singing or a cake, but as the organizer, a polite verbal acknowledgement would have been appreciated.   Most of our party arrived 15-20 minutes early and ordered drinks. The bartender was also not interested in our existence - although not busy, she needed to be flagged down more than once, no drink menus offered, etc.   As the time window for the reservation approached, the hostess approached me and reminded me of the policy - your entire party needs to be present in order to be seated, reservations are held for 15 minutes after the stated time - which I was aware of. I let the hostess know that a couple from our party was running late and would arrive within the window. She repeated the policy again (it had been less than five minutes since she told me the policy). Before replying, I looked around the empty except for a guy at the bar section of the restaurant and said, \"Well, I certainly understand your policy. If our table is needed, let me know and we can change our plans accordingly.\" At that moment the couple, who was 12 minutes late, arrived. We sat ourselves, as the hostess had vanished.   Our server was ok. But the entire experience was devoid of anything even remotely resembling a pleasantry. No thank you, no anything.   Final thoughts: It's not like I won't eat at Umami again. I love the food. It will, however, be awhile before I return and longer before anyone in my group that evening will be willing to return. I don't understand why anyone would be as actively unwelcoming to a group of people trying to buy things and have an enjoyable time at a place. Especially when said group are darn near the only people trying to do so. While I certainly understand the need for a reservation policy like this, the strict enforcement probably doesn't need to be in place when your restaurant is quite literally empty otherwise. Also, the people eating and drinking at places, they are humans! Holy crap, talk to them! Say hello, say thank you, say f-off, say something!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Umami and I got off on the wrong foot from the very beginning. I live just a few doors down from this place, and have watched the restaurant take shape from the time they bought their house, renovated it, and opened their doors. The Willy St. neighborhood is a pretty friendly community. We're used to living in a mixed-use area of commercial and residential buildings. We are proud of our thriving local businesses, and strive to support them. We have a long tradition of residents and businesses working together on this street.  But Umami hasn't shown itself to be anything approaching a local citizen. I have yet to meet the owners, I received no forewarnings or apologizes for the endless construction traffic impeding flow on Willy street during their renovation process. I received no invitation to an opening night, no neighborly olive branch. As far as I know, Umami's owners are out-of-towners unfamiliar with Madison's culture and just looking to make a buck. As a few others have commented, Umami's sign, like it's building, is hidden and nondescript. Most patrons don't find their parking lot - meaning that people who actually live on Willy St and rely on street parking are starting to become accustomed to not being able to find parking in the evenings.  But all this is local stuff, right? For most of you, how Umami treats it's neighbors is small beans. A month after Umami opened, I decided to let go of my resentments and give it a go.   Friends from Japan were visiting from out of town, so we thought this would be the perfect opportunity. Contrary to what many have said here, I found the service was the highlight of the experience. If anything, this place is overstaffed- and the owners have obviously gone to great lengths to maintain Asian appearances!   My first shock came when I walked in the door. The exterior of the building fails completely to capture what the owners are apparently going for. I was hoping for a homey and comfortable noodle joint. Walking in, I was blasted with a decor scheme that screamed \"Chic New York Asian-Fusion.\" The sparse menu was a disappointing mix of the two. I got the vegetarian dumplings, and my companions ordered ramen. Both were shockingly unremarkable. The high prices and trying-very-hard decor tried to overshadow the menu's bland least-common-denominator approach to Japanese food. But the result felt out of touch with Madison. Where's the taste? Where's the fun? Where's the palate bursting with unexpected flavor combinations? At the very least- where's the careful and delicate ritual and presentation that makes Japanese food so famous? The menu seems optimized instead for ease and profitability."}
{"text":"Great meal (ramen to die for), great service by Colleen, but unfortunately a very dour hostess who set a terrible tone.  An unsmiling Ashley informed me that even though the restaurant was 2/3 empty with less than an hour to go before closing, she wouldn't seat me until my wife arrived - this after I told Ashley she was parking right out front  and would be in in two minutes - which she was.  We then asked if we could have a table where we could sit next to each other ( there were many open) and again Ashley couldn't accommodate us and said we could sit at the bar.    On one hand Ashley's attitude was not a big deal as everything else was great but a poor hostess can do a lot of damage to an establishment's feel."}
{"text":"I've always had a great time at umami! The buns are probably my favorite. Light and fluffy and every filling option is great, even the tofu (not kidding, even if you eat meat try the spicy tofu). The spring roll with the peanut dipping sauce is very fresh and delicious. I like the dumplings but would rather focus on the buns and ramen. I've had the vegetarian and meat ramen, and probably to no ones surprise the meat has a ton more flavor and the topping options are much better. I think they should still put the egg in the vegetarian version since there is a separate vegan version. The garlic and spicy bombs are a fun way to add some more depth (just don't get the garlic bomb prior to having to speak closely with someone because your breath will be terrible)! Service has also always been good. Definitely the kind of place that once you try you will keep going back."}
{"text":"Let me just say, this place I think is my new favorite restaurant in Madison.  Now I know I'm new here and I have a lot of other places to try...but oh my gosh...Umami hands down the best in Madison.   The roommates and I decided to have a little night out, and stopped her for a late dinner around 9ish.  The wait was an hour, but we spent that time getting a drink across the street, and we weren't really in a huge hurry.   Let me just first say, Umami is a very warm intimate, cozy place.  Our server was absolutely the best, super attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. We started off with Edamane, which is hard to mess up anyway, but they were coated in a course salt, and perfect. Once it was time to put our order in, I ended up getting the Spicy Pulled Pork Buns.  I don't generally like Pork, but PULLED pork i'll make an exception for, and I was craving something spicy.   When our food came out (and at a pretty speedy rate) the presentation of it all was great. My entree came with two Buns, with the pork in the middle of them, garnished with pickled carrots. As soon as I took my first bite into the Buns....I was in love. Honestly, the best thing I have ever had in my life.  The buns are almost like a spongy kind of bread that just absorbs all the goodness. The spicy yet sweet pork mixed with the pickled carrots all in one bite sent an explosion to my mouth.  I was very sad after I had scarfed them down, but just having the two medium sized buns was so filling.  My roommates, and their friend decided on getting a dessert after the very filling meal. We ended up getting the Green Tea Creme Brulee, and the Red Bean, and The sesame Mochi.  Both fantastic. The Creme Brulee was so creamy, with a hard chocolate shell, and not overpoweringly sweet. The Mochi balls, so so good. It has almost like a jelly outer coating, with what I would compare to as Ice Cream in the inside. Both flavors were fantastic.  I'll end the review by saying, I plan on stopping in a lot more, next on my list will probably be the dumplings! :)"}
{"text":"Walking in felt pretty special - there's a bar to the right, a seating area in the middle, and a fair bit of al fresco seating to the left - a nice option for those perfect Madison summers. The walls have some interesting bits of art like slabs of wood dipped in paint that enhance the atmosphere.   We tried the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was really salty. I liked that a soft-boiled egg came with it, but it tasted like it was made earlier that day and reheated. Same goes for the noodles. I could be wrong about how they do the prep, just going with my tastebuds here.  For me, the only benefit of going out to eat dumplings, buns, or ramen are to experience the freshly made kind without the hassle. So when the Ramen ingredients tasted assembled rather than made-to-order it was truly disappointing for me. I don't think I'd be back for the food.   The saketini menu looked interesting, and we went with the Tokyo Snow Pear. It wasn't too sweet which was good, but I mostly tasted pear juice and slightly flat soda water. It's possible that by this time my senses were dulled from all that salt. If there is a next time, I'd go with a beer."}
{"text":"The place is very contemporary and has a nice atmosphere inside. The drinks look great but we didn't have any. We tried the pork buns and they were delicious and fresh. The dumplings were uninspired and probably made from a frozen premade batch. The miso ramen was very good but the pork ramen was a bit too salty. Overall it was a pleasant experience and worth a trip."}
{"text":"I had a bowl of shoyu (soy-based) ramen with thinly slicked pork and I also added a portion of extra pork belly. They certainly know what to do with the pork. It was very delicious. What I didn't do was adding an extra shot of spicy bomb.   The noodle soup wasn't very hot, like pho usually is. I am not sure whether that's the way it is with Japanese soup or mine just wasn't heated right.   Sitting in the patio was a treat. Although my table was very close to our neighbors, but the noise level was comfortable. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"You gotta love good bao.  We need more casual places like this.  Parking is hell though."}
{"text":"First off, I love the fact that it's operated out of a house. Really cool design on the inside, with a modern-esque feel to it.  The waiter was very friendly, and the service pretty good, though a bit slow (but that might just be a trend when it comes to Asian food in Madison)  The food itself was only alright. We got a plate of the pork and chive dumplings to share, which were quite bland to be honest. The best part about dumpings is the soup inside the wrapper, and these were pretty dry. Granted, the dumplings were pan fried, but still, it had no soup whatsoever.   I thought the ramen was pretty mediocre, but for midwest standards, it'll do."}
{"text":"Well, as a ramen and dumpling bar, they do have a a number of choices.. however, i don't find their ramen to be that authentic they do taste good, it's just not what I have had in the actual Japanese ramen places... BUT they do have various kinds of SAKE :)  but overall, not bad for a ramen place in Madison?"}
{"text":"We visited Umami Ramen & Dumpling Bar on Martin Luther King Day as part of restaurant week.   The atmosphere was inviting. The restaurant is in a house built during the 1800s which has been renovated into a chic space. The entrance is on the side. There is street parking in front and a small parking lot in back. The decor was inviting and interesting. There are a couple of different rooms in addition to the kitchen. It's not a big space and the waiting area always had patrons waiting for a table. The bar was packed. The clientele was mainly 20 somethings.  The drink menu includes a variety of good beers, a few wines, saki, and a variety of Vietnamese inspired beverages including some excellent cocktails. The menu is composed primarily of various varieties of dumplings, steamed buns and ramen.   Our waitress was prompt and polite. Originally we were all planning to do the Restaurant Week menu: pick a bun, a dumpling, a ramen, and a mochi for $25. Based on the menu we originally guessed the main advantage was getting the mochi included in the price. However, after close inspection of the menu and questioning the waitress, it turns out the Restaurant Week meal was only 1/2 the bun and 2/3 of the dumpling. There is no savings for Restaurant Week. The waitress explained it as a chance to try a little of everything. I guess my expectations for Restaurant Week were that you were getting a discount for going out in the middle of Winter but that was not the case here.  The sweet buns were all excellent. Chewy sweet buns, tangy fresh insides. We tried 3 different types. I thought the BBQ was the best, but all were tasty. We also enjoyed 3 types of dumplings. All were best with the soy vinegar sauce. The spicy sauce didn't add much flavor, nor spice. The ramen was the biggest disappointment for me. The broth was bland. The texture of the noodles was good, but although I ordered the tonkotsu which was described as a rich pork broth, it really tasted more like miso but with very little depth.  Although I would return to Umami Ramen for drinks, I think you can get as good of buns and dumplings elsewhere and as for the ramen, I've had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious! The ramen is really really good, drinks are amazing, and the dumplings are to die for! They're absolutely delicious, everything is freshly made, and the staff/service is wonderful. First timers should feel comfortable going, they'll recommend options for you and help you pair courses. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Convenient to my apartment, I probably eat here about once a week. Their pork buns are amazing, and I like the cocktails, too."}
{"text":"We were the first guests at 10AM this morning. It was so amazing. The service was obviously great since we were the only people there. BUNS. DUMPS. MOSAS! BISCS N GRAV!!! Everything was A+."}
{"text":"3.5 stars?  Way better than that, especially for the money.  I recommend sharing an order of pork belly buns and veggy dumplings and getting your own bowl of miso raman with smoked tofu.  Sit outside if the weather allows and watch people on Willy St."}
{"text":"We expected too much from this place. We have been trying to come here for so long and when we finally did, it was not as great as I hoped it would be.   That being said, their service was excellent. I loved their pork bun. The umami ramen had good ingredients but the broth could be richer. It lacked something distinct and I can't say what. Its just that we had just visited Sujeo and tasted their Sujeo Ramen and we couldn't help but compare flavors. Sujeo had a much richer broth.   One thing I would recommend staying far away from is their dumplings. It was straight out of a frozen packet. Our's has raw edges as well- it wasn't steamed through out. We also tried their burrito for brunch. The chips and salsa that came with was the best. The burrito itself was nothing out of the ordinary.   I would hope to get back here again to try their dinner menu. They have much more variety of Ramen for dinner. I won't come back for brunch again."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen. Good vegetarian selection."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Umami for the first time this week and were disappointed.  We started with shrimp and shitake mushroom dumplings, which were decent though they did not have a shrimp taste.  My husband had the veggie ramen and I had the pork version.  Both were overly salty; the veggie version had tastier broth but both were farily bland.  There were no subtle tastes.  Overall, the ramen bowls were passable but nothing we would return for.  The decor is soothing, clean and distinctive and the service was good.  The menu is limited but we did not try the appetizers or salads."}
{"text":"I love the food here and never get tired of it. However, there's one HUGE (and in my mind) unforgivable issue - they refuse to do ramen to-go. It's not that they can't - I've gone in, ordered it, and then asked for a to-go containers and boxed it up myself - it's that they won't. And, as far as I can tell, they haven't bothered to try to find a solution for the \"issue\" which, according to them, is that the \"top blows off the container\". Yeah... Not if you put the noodles in a separate container and ensure that the soup isn't boiling at the time that you box it. I've proven this more than once.   Today, I had surgery. All I wanted to eat was Umami tonkatsu ramen and some pork buns. I don't want Graze ramen (which I could get to go). I don't want Wah Kee noodles (which I could get to go). I just wanted Umami. I called, pleaded my case, and even told them how to box it up and I was told no. If this review sounds at all like sour grapes, that's because it is. It's written while I'm hungry, in pain, and now pissed off. It may take me a while to get over this, regardless of how good the food is."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled as you pull up to Umami. The restaurant looks like an normal house on the outside, but inside there is a small bar and about a dozen tables inside.   Umami's bar has a nice selection of sake, sake mixed drinks, and a good selections of beer. It's not too big, but it's big enough to mingle and make some new friends. One thing I didn't understand is how you could not take your bar tab to your table. The bartender made me close out and pay before sitting down to order food.   The food was decent. Nothing to write home and tell everyone to fly out to Madison to try their food. The best thing we had were the steam pork buns. Pretty traditional. Nice steamed bun, with a nice slice of pork belly served with scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce. The dumplings weren't anything special. Tasted like frozen pot stickers from the store. We had an order of pork and shrimp, and I probably had a total of 3 whole shrimps in 4 potstickers. The ramen was decent. I'm glad we ordered the other food because this is probably the smallest bowl of ramen I've ever had. Noodles were cooked well, but I think i had two strips of bamboo shoots and half a cup of noodles. The tonkatsu soup was lacking on the pork flavor. It had a good color, but was really light on the fatty pork flavor.  Overall, Umami was delicious for the area and it could be a lot worse. If I am ever back in Madison and I need a bowl of ramen, Umami is the place to go."}
{"text":"We ordered potstickers and they tasted just like the frozen ones sold at Trader's Joe. The noodle soup did not taste anything near Japanese food.  Maybe, the taste is adjusted to the local taste. I'm just saying. If you want to taste the original Japanese food, this is not your place."}
{"text":"Just had brunch... Kinda pigged out... The interior of the restaurant is nice, modern and clean... All three of the waitresses were nice greet my boyfriend and i quickly... We where told about the drink specials as soon as we were seated... I am bummed cuz I didn't catch the waitresses name but she was so quick and swear I just for a blink of an eye a filled water glass showed up... Same with all of our dishes... Speedy service... Everything was hot and tasted delicious... I was able to take a photo of most of our meal but I missed the pork buns because we gobbled them up so quickly... My boyfriend and I order  2 of the brunch ramens, beef buns, pork buns, coffee and a vet. Iced coffee everything was so good... We will definitely be visiting again to try the dinner menu..."}
{"text":"Update, having been a few more times I think the staff have gotten their sea legs and quality is much more consistent.    In fact the very thin waiter we have had the last few times has been really good and professional.  We have had much less trouble getting a seat in a reasonable time and have not been treated snootily.  The pork buns are always good, several other places in town have them now but Umamis are the best.  The dumplings still underwhelm, I stopped getting them.  But the Ramen... I would eat it several times a week if I could.  Miso+garlic Bomb, Pork+ spicy, both amazing.  Have had the veggie and it was great too.  So good, I just finished dinner and I still want to eat their Ramen right now!  It seems much more consistent though it has settled on the non-salty side, personally I liked it pretty salty.  They will not sell it for take-out, or at least they would not when I last asked, which is a disappointment when you live down the street."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when Umani finally opened. I like oriental a lot, and this was a twist I had yet to experience. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the result.  My girlfriend and I went for dinner there Midwest without reservations - no problems there. Though the restaurant is quite small, we were seated immediately. The decor and ambience is nice; I would say it's appropriate for a somewhat casual date, or a slightly nicer place for a group of friends. The service was fine, everything was clean.  The reason I give umani two stars is its food quality. My girlfriend and I had a good sampling of the menu, from appetizers to entrees, and nothing was impressive, or even good. The food wasn't bad, and it was cheap, but there was nothing at all that we tried which made me want to come back.   Overall: seems like an ok place to bring a group of friends for cocktails and sake, but I wouldn't recommend it for a meal unless you're on a particularly tight budget, though even then, there are better options."}
{"text":"I went to Umami on a Friday night around 9pm, and though it was busy we didn't have to wait for a table. The restaurant is built on an incline and is in what, according to our waiter, was originally a blacksmith's shop. It's an interesting space, complete with abstract wooden wall hangings, a mural of Japanese buildings on a wall near the bar, bamboo pieces hanging from the ceiling, Asian-style screens, pink and orange pastel accents, and a tiki torch burning out front. The standout decorations were definitely the colored bulbs hanging near the cash register. With the baby-making music playing and an overall mellow vibe, this restaurant would be a great date place.   Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu items' ingredients, but he seemed a little harried by the Friday night crowd and subsequently put-upon when I asked him twice what was in the special, the $12 Wasame Ramen. Though I was a bit fuzzy about its ingredients, I ordered it.  It turns out that Wasame is Japanese for two different broths: pork and chicken. In addition, it was a mix of soy and miso flavors and came with corn, seaweed, pork belly, marinated bamboo shoots, a hard-boiled egg, scallions, toasted sesame seeds, sprouts, and ramen noodles (recipe made fresh at RP's Pasta). The ramen was an orgasmic yin and yang of flavor and texture. The egg yolk was rich and creamy, and the pork belly melted in my mouth. The soup was so rich that by the time I got three-quarters of the way through my bowl, I felt nauseous. My dining mate got a simpler ramen with pork stock off the regular menu, but after trying mine she wished she'd ordered the special too.   Though we didn't indulge, there was a very full drink menu (most under $10), including saketinis, cocktails, sake, Japanese draft beer, wine, and \"booze.\"   I must admit I don't have that much ramen experience to contrast Umami with, but I'd give it an enthusiastic thumbs up and wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious poke appetizer! The ramen was pretty good considering we're in Wisconsin, but my favorite ramen is in the San Francisco Bay Area. The noodles are not like traditional ramen noodles, but they were thinner (almost like angel hair). The broth was pretty good, but the whole bowl of ramen seems overpriced to me. $12 for a bowl of soup, and that's before toppings?? With toppings, you can end up spending $15+ for a simple bowl of ramen. For two people we spent $57 before tip, and that was for 1 glass of wine, 1 thai tea, 2 bowls of ramen, 1 poke app, and 1 dessert. A little steep, if you ask me, especially for Madison. The atmosphere was super cute, the bar had a good feel, and the bartender was very nice. Try it out, but it's a little expensive."}
{"text":"Came in as a walk-in on a rainy Thursday night and it seems like everyone else had the same hankering for ramen as me. I had to wait about 25 minutes for a table but the host was really good about keeping me updated with how soon a table would come free, which I thought was really helpful.  I ordered a glass of the house sake, an order of pork buns, and the tonkatsu ramen. The sake was fairly bland. I was told that the pork buns were award winning. I have to admit that I am always surprised to know that there is such a competition. But as such an award might suggest they were really delicious. The pork was nice and tender. And the bun went really well together with a nice hoisin sauce as well as a fresh crunch from the cucumbers.   As for the main reason I was here, the ramen was just okay. I was hoping for a little bit of a richer broth. Instead it was a little salty. The noodles, egg, bamboo shoots, and seaweed were all fine but to me the broth is the key to ramen greatness and it came up short in that area."}
{"text":"Pork Buns are to die for!  The combination of the crisp cucumber, tender savory  pork and soft bun make this a must."}
{"text":"Went to Umami the other night for the first time. I had the spicy pulled pork buns, which were nothing short of exceptional, and we shared the dumplings, which were equally delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went to Umami over the weekend for brunch. Before I write my review, I should preface it by saying...here is what I knew about Umami before I ate there. 1. Umami means the fifth taste sensation. 2. It's Asian-inspired. That's it. Seriously, that's all I knew. I am not a connoisseur of this kind of food at all. But, I gotta say...it was awesome.  We had a reservation for six people right at 10 a.m. Can I just say how much I LOVE that they take brunch reservations on the weekend??? Our waitress was amazing. She was exceptionally patient and helpful in explaining the dishes to us. She offered two people in our party a special gluten-free dish that is not on the menu when they mentioned they didn't eat gluten. She even knew all about the history of the restaurant and its owner(s) and was able to give us all kinds of information that I wouldn't normally expect a server to know. The service alone was five-star quality, but the food was even better.  Again, I'm a novice Asian-inspired Umami eater...and I don't eat meat. This knocked down my options a bit, but I ended up with the BELT buns (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, and Tomato) without the bacon and the edamame dumplings.  First, the buns. I asked if the buns could come with cheese instead of bacon, and originally the server said yes, but later came back to say the chef had denied that request. I am guessing that (s)he knew that cheese would just not work in this case, and I was happy (s)he didn't let me mess up a good meal with cheese. The buns were delicious, the veggies were fresh, and the spicy Korean sauce that came on it was incredible. I am actually still dreaming of that sauce. Soooo good.   I also ordered the edamame dumplings. There is a choice of sauces, but I opted to let the server choose what she though would be best, and she chose some kind of sweet and sour sauce which was almost as amazing as the spicy Korean sauce on the buns. Before I ordered, I offered to share my dumplings with my friends, but after they came, I was second-guessing that decision. I think I begrudgingly gave away one, but I ate all the rest myself.  One friend let me try her gluten-free special of hash and kimchi. I don't know that I will ever be a huge kimchi fan, but the potatoes were pretty fabulous, not to mention it was just awesome that the server and the chef even offered up this special meal.    To drink I had a mango mojito, which was really good, though I'm a bit skeptical that it actually contained any alcohol. It kind of just tasted like a pricey juice. I missed the special drink menu with the mimosas, but I will definitely be trying one the next time I go. For someone who wasn't even sure if she would like the food at Umami, I came out a lover and a believer. I now want to take everyone I know to Umami for the food and the service. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It's really funny. Having read through some of the reviews on yelp I was expecting the ramen broth to be really salty. It was the opposite of salty. It was completely flavorless water.   This is what we ordered: pickled vegetables to share between a few people, pork buns, pork and chives dumplings (\"the classic\") and the miso ramen.  Others in the table got the tonkotsu ramen and miso ramen with pork belly.   The pickled vegetables came on a long plate and there were just a few pieces of each thing. It was a bit disappointing/ridiculous how little of each thing there was. For example: 3 extremely thin slices of carrot. The dish came with cauliflower, some type of green, radish, and carrot. The way it was all arranged on the plate showed they were trying for something classy that really missed the mark. The flavors followed suit as it all tasted the same, of overpowering sweet pickling juice. Would never ever order this again.  Then came the dumplings. These were not so bad really. About decent, pretty salty but I think well cooked. Would never go here for the dumplings but if I was forced to come again I would be content just eating these as a snack.   Then the buns. I guess as a personal note, I don't like this trendy slider-style for buns; what's wrong with just a good bao. But regardless, the sauce (hoisin) was too sweet and clashed with whatever else was inside. And it was full of sauce. Whatever reviewers said these buns were good have clearly not had even decent buns. Just because you're using pork belly doesn't make them good.   Finally, for the least *umami* part of the meal...the ramen. It was so flavorless... watery broth, megh noodles. The slices of chicken looked and tasted drab, most of the sprouts were not even whole but either chopped or just broken. Finally, wow, one sheet of the most tasteless seaweed I have ever had. Not a single ingredient in this soup was redeemable. We ended up adding all the soy sauce that we got for our dumplings  plus part of the garlic sauce that came with the tonkotsu ramen that someone else ordered and it was still completely flavorless. I have never called a soup trashwater before today. Others in our table were also completely unimpressed. A ramen place with horrible ramen...I hope they shut down soon so something else can take its place. I wish restaurants would just focus on having good ingredients and cooking things well, but instead we get generic and bland food.   At the end of the night, we can cook better ramen at home by just cutting up some carrots and onions throwing them in the broth with some semi-decent korean noodles and then cracking an egg in there...  ...In response to the other reviewer: I guess not all white people love Umami.  Seriously, you may be sitting around debating where to go. Maybe you have eaten all your favorite restaurants recently and want to try something new. Do NOT eat here if you want a good meal. We were debating between multiple restaurants and this came up because no one had tried it. If you find yourself in the same situation, put your foot down and don't let this ruin your night too."}
{"text":"Why all the hate?? For a city that is sooo severely and desperately lacking in Asian cuisine, Umami is a diamond in the rough. Yes, I've certainly had better Asian food, but this is by far my favorite in Madison.  Sure, you can go buy frozen dumplings and make them yourself and that would cost you a lot less. Just don't get the dumplings then. If you do, you'd be paying for service and non-frozen dumplings.   I'd recommend the steamed buns instead. I'm a big fan of Umami's pork buns. The Korean bulgogi buns are interesting as well, but might not fit everyone's taste.   But the clutch items on Umami's menu are definitely the ramen varieties. The noodles are freshly made, the broth is tasty, and the ingredients are great. You can always pay to add more ingredients into your ramen bowl, like I've always done. Where is the nearest place where you can get semi-genuine, non-instant ramen at a full service restaurant?  The drink list is creative and the dessert is limited, but mochi ice cream balls were a delight to see.  If some other brave and entrepreneuric soul starts up a better Asian restaurant in Madison, please call me back to the area."}
{"text":"Recently visited for a Yelp! Elite dinner event, where I tried several menu items and I also recently visited for brunch. Both meals were excellent.  First, I'd like to talk about the space. It's a converted older home on Willy St., and is a complete surprise to walk in and see how they've decorated in a modern Asian style. I was very impressed. I had only tried their food during Willy St. Fair in the past (the buns are GREAT and easy to eat street food), and so sat on their large deck or stayed in the street.   For dinner, we shared several items, each of which were quite good. I absolutely loved the tuna appetizer as a main course. I try to watch my calorie intake when eating out, and this was a great meal, filling, and high quality tuna. Another person at our table ordered a salad with a mix of mushrooms and a light dressing. The salad was beautifully presented and appeared to taste even better than it looked to the person who ordered it.  This is the type of place that friends who may be unsure of eating Asian foods will be sure to love. They also can accommodate a variety of diets, so the carnivore and herbivore will both be satisfied.  Now for brunch. I was blown away by the interesting Asian fusion menu and had to make a return trip to try it for myself. My husband and I were both blown away with the interesting choices (bacon, egg and cheese potstickers - HELLO!) and completely ate our fill that day. It's now on my short list of brunch places for out of town guests.  Both visits we have had outstanding and helpful servers who were just as excited about the food as we were and never hesitated to make recommendations."}
{"text":"First place I've ever ventured out in trying steamed buns! They were fantastic. We split the spicy tofu buns, a ramen noodle soup with \"spice bomb\", summer rolls, and mushroom salad. All was very good and the service was excellent. Our waiter could not have been better. Can't wait to go back and try the pork buns next."}
{"text":"Wow, this is amazing. I had tofu buns and vegie dumplings. The buns are more like soft, pillowy pancakes, folded over like an omelette with the fillings inside. The vegie dumplings were perfect, steamed just long enough. The ingredients in both dishes were absolutely fresh, and the tofu was the meaty, substantial kind, not the squishy, moist kind. I had the O-cha Mark to drink, and it about knocked me over. It's Maker's Mark, green tea, and honey, but all I could taste was the Maker's, and there was a lot of it. Some wouldn't complain, but I was the driver. The green tea creme brulee for dessert was worth the fat and calories.  We sat outside, and the traffic noise wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. If we'd had to sit inside it would have felt claustrophobic. The building is very small, and it was very busy. There was a flowering bush next to the deck that smell  divine. The service was pleasant and helpful, but we had to ask two different people three times total for our first glass of water. A tiny thing...we'd come back, even if they had no water."}
{"text":"I have a lot of five-star reviews, but I guess I like to review GREAT experiences.  :)    To be honest and up-front, I used to work at Umami when it first opened.  It's been quite a while since then, so I feel fair in writing my review because my husband and I still love to eat there and order carry-out.  The only downfall there is that I can't have the Hanami Blossom Sake-tini.    Our absolute favorite item on the menu is the new beef buns.  They are AMAZING!  Though it's tough to give second seat to the original pork buns, because those are fantastic as well.  The fluffy rice buns are yummy and it seems the proportions of ingredients are right-on (at least to my palate).    I love the hand-made dumplings.  My favorites are the chicken and mushroom ones with your standard soy-vinegar sauce.  They are served right off the fry pan- delicious!    I don't often order the ramen, but customers raved about it when I was there.  The Tonkotsu is my favorite, and I am a sucker for the flavored egg.  Order an extra, and add the pork belly!  You won't regret it.  Finish your dinner with the green tea creme brulee and you'll have had an awesome meal.  :)"}
{"text":"Yep, this place is as good as everyone says it is. Even when I went and there were equipment malfunctions in the kitchen and the wait was very long, we were very happy with the experience. They gave us a free drink, apologized profusely, and, when we did sit, our server was amazing and attentive, and we got our food very quickly. The miso ramen with a spicy bomb was SO tasty! I definitely will be back to try the other ramen styles."}
{"text":"First ramen since I came to Wisconsin and I came around Hangover Time (10am-2pm). Loved every bite and sip! Go if you can, go...NOW!"}
{"text":"So I revisited this place and have decided to give it an extra star. I was much more hungry this time than the first time I visited which was a deciding \"meh factor\". What I learned is definitely to get the \"spice bomb\" option for any broths, especially if you prefer a spicy touch. It's a shame you have to pay for \"extra taste\" for something that should be complimentary(every table should have spices/sauces) but it made the place better to me than before."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. There's a reason they have won awards for their pork buns. My entire meal could have consisted of multiple orders of pork buns and I would have been satisfied.  Girlfriend and I split an order of dumplings, which ended up being closer to potstickers than my previous encounters with dumplings, but were still quite nice. Not the best potstickers/dumplings I've had, but definitely worth the money.  Got the chicken miso ramen, and it was exactly what it was supposed to be - hot, salty, and loaded up with green onions and chicken, along with half of a boiled egg. Personally I prefer fried eggs in my ramen, but it was still nice.  The restaurant itself is pretty bland, but you're going there for the food, so I wasn't bothered. Staff was overwhelmed on a Sunday night, and I was a bit miffed that the hostess couldn't give us even an estimate of how long we would be waiting. It ended up being only a few minutes, but I considered leaving for someplace else since it seemed so random as to when we'd actually be seated. I think even one more person would have given them some reprieve.  Overall a good place for Japanese food that is actually pretty accurate to what you'd find within the actual country."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for months ever since I read an article about it last fall.  When I heard about the grand opening last Friday, some friends and I planned to have dinner there on Sunday.  Sadly, they were closed.  But we found out their hours and a friend and I went there today for lunch.  In short, it was worth the wait!  Lunch service at Umami is pretty different from dinner service, or so we were told.  We were seated right away, brought menus, and told to order up at the bar and they would bring us our food.    We decided to go with the trio of foods - dumplings, salad and ramen for $13.  It was a really great deal.  I ordered the Umami Mushroom Arugula salad, Veggie Dumplings with smoked tofu, bok choy and shiitake mushrooms, and Tonkotsu Ramen (pork ramen with egg, roast pork, bamboo shoots, nori and green onions).    The mushroom salad was delicious - shiitake, baby portabello, button mushrooms, red onion, cucumber and cherry tomatoes.  Very fresh greens and vegetables, and the trio of mushrooms were very flavorful.  I loved the sesame soy dressing on this salad.  All of the salads sounded good, so I'm looking forward to trying others.  The dumplings were my favorite part of this meal.  I was surprised to get a whole tray of 6 dumplings with my order!  And let me tell you - the dumplings were amazing!  They had the perfect pan-fried crust on the bottom, the dumpling was soft and chewy, and the flavors inside really melded together well.  When I ordered, I was recommended a specific dipping sauce, and I heartily agree that the pairing of the spicy soy sauce with the veggie dumplings was spot-on.  My friend had the pork and chive dumplings with a different sauce, and you could really taste the chive and ginger.  Delicious!  Sadly, the ramen was only okay for me.  The roast pork and egg was delicious, but I wasn't too excited about the broth.  The broth was a little bland to me, but then I tend to really love bold flavors.  If the broth was just a little bit richer in pork flavor, it would have made for an excellent bowl of ramen.  Still, the other ingredients - the locally produced noodles, the egg, the nori and the green onions - stood out for me.  The bamboo shoots were a unique flavor, but tasted a little bitter to me.  It's probably more the type of bamboo shoot.    The service was very friendly, but a little unobservant at times when my water glass needed refilling and no one was around.  But the owners are very nice, and they are still getting things finalized.  They did a great job with the atmosphere and the interior.  I definitely want to go back for dinner to try out some of their cocktails which I hear are some of the best and most unique in Madison.  I also want to try out some of their other dishes and appetizers because everything sounds so good.  Overall, I give Umami 4 out of 5 stars, and who knows?  That may change to 5 after a few more visits.  :)"}
{"text":"Good ramen, great (and adorable!!) atmosphere. This ramen place is in an old house with inside seating, and a lovely outdoor patio. Unfortunately I don't have a photo of the bowl of ramen as it was too dark, but I was happy with it. I had the tonkotsu ramen with pork belly - the broth was thick and flavorful, noodles were good, the egg was prepared and seasoned well. The seaweed appetizer was surprisingly good and unusual with the addition of tasty shiitake mushrooms. One thing that I didn't really enjoy was the spring roll appetizer which was rather bland."}
{"text":"The place is laid back, very simple, the patio is a fine place on a good day. However the food is average at best. For me the thing that would really move this from average to good would be if the ramen broth was 'clear' just like the inexpensive stuff everyone expects.... Here the broth is murky and a bit muddled tasting... I would go back for appetizers and drinks on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Their ramen was mediocre... But there really isn't good traditional ramen in Madison.... Their buns on the other hand are delicious! I would go back for the buns and pass on the ramen... But that's probably because I've been to ramen tatasuya in Austin... And I don't think any other place can compare."}
{"text":"Tonight, we were chased away from the bar by the trustafarian bartender with dreads*. Apparently, the bar isn't first come first serve like it is every other night of the week and we learned that the hard way when she ridiculed us for not checking with the hostess first.  Really bummed because we've loved coming to this place regularly for the past year! There's no doubt that the food is great - delicious buns, savory ramen, and the drinks are solid.  Unfortunately, the service is very inconsistent. They care about their guests even when it's pretty clear they're overwhelmed (note: it's a small space) but some deal with it much better than others... We'll be back to see Ashley and the terrific servers, but aren't interested in service with that sort of attitude again.  *I have no problem with dreads just pretentious \"hippies\"... (:"}
{"text":"They need some competition because they are definitely overcharging. Nonetheless, it's still good."}
{"text":"Came here to take relatives out to dinner, worst dinning experience. Pork buns tasted nasty they were left uneaten, limited menu, no rice dishes, dumplings are the only thing edible and all over priced. Left hungry, grossed out and disappointed."}
{"text":"First time eating at Umami, I'm definitely not a ramen expert in any way. We had the classic pork and chive dumplings as well as the pork buns for appetizers, and they were both amazing!  I had the tonkotsu and it was pretty good, but I wasn't a big fan of whatever slabs of meat they put in there. Not flavorful in a good way. The rest of the soup was good.   Honestly I would go back just for the appetizers! And we might try brunch next time.   Problems:  It took a LONG time to get any food at all. The patio was busy, the inside of the restaurant was pretty dead. But overall it shouldn't have been busy to the point that the kitchen couldn't keep up. We had been to the gym already and were starving, so that's why we ordered two appetizers. But they didn't come for at LEAST 30-40 minutes. And then our appetizers and meal came out at the same time, which kind of sucked."}
{"text":"Fantastic vibe being built in a house. I haven't been to a restaurant that has been converted like that before. Living in Japan town in San Jose and being spoiled with amazing eats there. Umami puts time and effort to deliver great food and atmosphere.   It can get busy so be sure you plan to go early or later ! I'm a late night crowd so hitting it up late was fantastic felt like we had the whole place to ourselves.  Got the vegan dumplings and hot buns. Very flavorful and was spot on. Also had the vegetarian ramen. Usually hard to find something that hits with strong flavor notes so I'm happy to say they know what their doing"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. YUM! Tried the pork and chive dumplings, and my husband and I fought over the last one. The miso ramen is something that I dream about in my sleep. Delicious! The only thing I can complain about is the parking- although it seems silly to complain about, as the restaurant is basically a house, so their lot is the size of a driveway. That won't stop me from returning again and again, however!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for ramen in Madison.  Ramen Station on Park Street is also good, but Umami has a lot of good appetizers (pork belly buns are very good), and the tonkotsu ramen here is my favorite.  There's a few parking spots in a lot, but unless you're lucky or get there early, you're likely going to be looking for street parking, which is really only a problem on weekends."}
{"text":"Had spicy ramen (there is only one ramen menu that says spicy) for lunch. The guy was nice enough to let us in before the store was open since the weather was so cold."}
{"text":"THE best food in Madison. Hands down. I dream about several dishes off the Umami menu.   Must haves are the tuna poke, the cold noodle special and my absolute favorite thing in the world: the beef buns. Their flavors are unlike anywhere I've been. The staff is all friendly and attentive, the patio is awesome for spending time enjoying your dinner outside, and the drinks are fun and unique as well.   Some other reviewers mentioned the pricing being high but I've never noticed it being anything above reasonable.   No doubt you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Dumplings are awesome and ramen fantastic. But... they need more space (super busy/crowded) and staff isn't particularly friendly"}
{"text":"Pork buns is a must try. For the ramens, I prefer miso ramen, which has the right amount of flavor~"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening. Place was busy on a cooling Sunday eve. Gracious and attentive hostess, delightful sours at the bar and a seat outside after a few minutes wait. Pickles: varied and surprisingly delightful flavors. Classic dumplings lava hot and best with ALL 3 sauces offered. A big ramen bowl to share and a bottle of sake=a very fine experience here on Madison's beloved East Side."}
{"text":"Great buns,  dumplings,  and ramen!  This was my first visit to Umami,  but I will definitely go back!  Love the vibe of the restaurant and the wait staff was super friendly and helpful in ordering.   Also,  great vegan selection!"}
{"text":"I beg to differ with many reviewers on the service at Umami. I thought it was really great. Perhaps the past lackluster servers have moved on, because it seemed like all servers here were quite attentive. I had Shannon as my waitress and she knew the menu in and out and was totally willing to answer any questions, and gave solid drink and food recommendations.   I ended up ordering the summer roll as an appetizer. Not entirely my thing, but that's just me. My dining mate really enjoyed it, along with the spicy peanut sauce. The miso ramen came next, and was pretty good. Strangely comforting. Could eat it for days with a smile on my face. For dessert I ordered the mango Mochi (on a mango kick as of late) and was in heaven. Perfect end to a pretty perfect meal.  Oh, and the interior is super awesome. Bravo to whoever fancied up the place."}
{"text":"TLDR : Good but not mind blowing ramen.   Came for brunch and got their brunch ramen. A Kanbu dashi and soy milk based broth with pork belly, bacon crumbling and various other veggies. The pork belly was very tender and had great taste. I was a little disappointed in the broth which felt a little weak. It had good flavor but the richness wasn't quite there.   Several of my other friends ordered the vegetable brunch ramens and thought their meal was amazing.   I'd like to come back for dinner and see if they have a pork based ramen. Until then I'll keep my review at 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not a ramen expert, but have been to several places in Portland and Madison and this is by far my favorite. I am in love with the bulgogi beef buns and ramen specials. The flavored eggs are absolutely incredible. Sometimes the staff can be a little awkward and slow. Generally the atmosphere is great. Very chill and interesting. When it is busy, large groups congregate near the door and encroach the tables making it loud and uncomfortable. If you're looking for a quiet time, it's a gamble."}
{"text":"Design/Interior: they killed it. They turned an unassuming, regular house on Willy St. into a stylish, modern, roomy restaurant. I felt really good being in the restaurant. As the owner described - they wanted you to feel like you're not in Madison anymore.  Cocktails: The cocktail craze has caught on and it seems like every restaurant is upping their game, with the unfortunate side effect of driving up drink prices.Their cocktail menu is diverse and creative with prices ($6-7) that are fair. I only tried two, and they both were yummy. The sake seems fairly solid, but I don't know what I'm talking about.  Food: Overall very good. The taco-style bbq pork buns were neat and tasty. The pickled veggies were good, but a small portion. The dumplings were top notch. The sauces were decent, could use a bit more pow. The ramen needs some work - I know they can do better. Mix in's and more diverse flavors would be a good start. The green tea brulee was a pleasant surprise.  Overall - I can't wait to go again. The owners seem passionate and have some good ideas for improving, like a patio for summer and a late night pork-only menu (sorry veggies!)."}
{"text":"The pork buns are AMAZING. The ramen is alright. But being that it is one of the only places in madison to get ramen, it's a great place to hang out and grab a nice lunch with friends. They have a patio and the atmosphere in the inside is small and intimate. I do think that the prices are a bit high for what it is though. For example the buns are $7 but you get only two in an order."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out this new place on Willy st.  It looks great from the outside with a nice patio to relax on.  I agree with some of the other reviewers though - you can do way better with your money at nearby places.  Our server raved about the ramen noodles, but for $12 I felt ripped off.  The noodles were just ok (really how fancy can ramen-style noodles be), but the broth was super salty and it wasn't very filling.  They also talk up their infused eggs, which is basically a salty hard boiled egg dipped in soy sauce and a few spices - save your money.  I didn't try the dumplings, but I probably won't waste my time or money going back to do so."}
{"text":"I Just Love This Place!  The hut on campus is where I get my lunch most. (Luv You Lunch Guys!)  The restaurant was really charming but I don't get over there very often."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place with ramen noodles and was so happy to stumble upon this place. Great food all around and it has a sushi bar! My friends and I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Mmmm Umami! This is one cool spot! We tried their dumplings, the pork chives is my favorite! Got the BBQ pork bun which was tasty as well. We ordered a shoyu ramen to share. They do something cool when you share ramen, upcharge 1.50 but add extra protein. This way it makes for a full meal. Drinks are great. Prices are maybe a little high. However ambiance is very cool in a cute old house. Definite Willy Street gem!"}
{"text":"Happiness! Rejoice! Hallelujah! Yippie!!!!!  That was how I felt when I pulled into the parking lot of Umami. I drove from Appleton, Wisconsin with no water in the car and a full bladder. I was so thirsty but desperate for a bathroom. I could have stopped somewhere but I pushed it thru.  I still took the time to appreciate the look of Umami from the outside as I was dancing holding it in. It wasn't what I expected. It's an old house converted to a Japanese noodle shop, with a cool patio seating area. Too bad, it was chilly and dark already but I could imagine it would be nice in the summer. Also, I liked that they have a small private parking lot. The torch outside the front door also was a nice touch.  The place was cozy and trendy inside. It was pretty busy for a Monday night. I sat by the bar since dining solo..after hitting the ladies room of course! Whew...then, I was ready to try out some drinks and ramen.   My stomach wanted to try the steamed buns, the dumplings plus a bowl of ramen. The brain said to myself that the stomach couldn't handle all those food. That was the bad part of eating alone. Not the fact you don't have a company to talk to. Hell, at times quiet is pretty fn nice. The bad part was the fact that you can't order more varieties of food.  The bartender got me sold on the Tokyo Snow Pear Saketini. It was so delicious and refreshing! Oh, I was so ready for that! It hit the spot. I also got a cup of green tea. It was good! However, they charged me $2 for a cup and if I wanted more it would be $4 for bottomless. That's the only issue I have with trendy Japanese noodle houses...It's a sacrilege to charge for green tea at a Japenese place let alone a two tier pricing.  The nice lady bartender told me the ramen special as I was checking out the menu. They had Tonkotsu pork broth ramen that I would have chosen if I didn't hear the special. They also have Shoyu, Miso, Vegan, selections. I opted for the Awase Ramen special made with a mixture of pork and chicken broths. It just sounded good and interesting.  Not long, the noodle came. The bowl was a good size and it was garnished with plenty of corn, bean sprouts, and scallion. The infused egg looked tantalizing. I took a slurp of the broth... Mh.. It was hot. It was temperature hot..just how I like it. Usually, they tend to serve it lukewarm which I dislike. So far so good! Then, I savored it more.. and I tasted the sixth flavor.. (Salty, Sweet, Bitter, Sour, Umami, Bland)....yep, bland. It needed a little more umpf.  I kept eating it and I enjoyed the taste of the corn, the nori, the pork belly, the noodle, the sprout, the runny yolk.... Then, I forgot about the bland broth. It tasted pretty good now. Plus, usually ramen is super salty and I could never finish it because of that. However this ramen...I was slurping away.  At the end, I was torn about the broth. I am really really torn. I like it enough that I can't wait to come back. The noodle was really special. I could tell it was fresh made noodle. It didn't have the kinks of Tokyo noodle but it tasted wonderful! The pork belly was also pretty good except they were kinda light in the portion. There were only one full slice and a couple bits of it.  I will be back and will try the Tonkotsu and the pork belly buns. I'll update my review then. I hope the next time the broth will give out the umami taste instead of bland. If not, the saketini will make it up anyway.  Update December 4, 2014  Came back for Shoyu Ramen and some shrimp and pork dumpling. Again it was bland, and I asked for soy sauce this time. My server asked if I prefer their seasoning sauce that had more of the umami quality than soy sauce. I said sure. It was perfect after I added a dash of the seasoning sauce. Yummm. The dumpling was homemade nice. I am not too crazy about the filling though. It felt like it was missing something, and the skin I thought was just a touch tough. I still enjoyed it though. I have to try the pork and chives dumpling next time."}
{"text":"Great dumplings and ramen! We ordered the classic dumplings as an appetizer, and they were fantastic. I also really liked the soy vinegar dipping sauce. I had the shoyu ramen, which was very flavorful and interesting. I've never had ramen before, and I really enjoyed it!  The restaurant is inside a house, which makes it really cute. It has great decorations, and would be a great place for a date or a dinner with friends. It's not too big though, so it might be hard to get a table for a big group.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My gf & I are foodies; this is our favorite restaurant in all of Madison. If you want to try some awesome ramen or want something else, you'll be hard pressed to find anything on the menu that doesn't taste amazing. The pork buns, tuna poke, and ramen are our go-to for dinner. You can split a ramen and add some extras & apps for a perfect date night. Or, come in for their Asian fusion brunch! The Tonkotsu pork biscuits and gravy is one of the best brunch foods I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything here that hasn't been fantastic! I have memories of a specialty ramen with sweet corn dancing in my head. Additionally, any place that has cr√®me br√ªl√©e is an automatic win for me, but their green tea cr√®me br√ªl√©e is second to none.  The pur√©ed edamame dumplings are so good, but you have to go to brunch to get them. That said, the brunch menu in general is not to be missed. Brunch ramen, biscuits and tonkotsu gravy, guava mimosas, and dumplings of course (plus more, but I'm drawing a blank). The staff/servers are great and when it's busy, they keep you apprised of when your food will be out and try to keep you happy in the meantime. Good work, Umami!"}
{"text":"http://theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com/2014/07/restaurant-reveiw-umami-ramen-dumpling.html  Let me give you a little background. I have been to Umami twice one year apart for a yearly large group.  The first time I went, one year ago, when I sat down the table was quite sticky. Like, this hasn't been wiped down in a few days sticky. In a place where long noodles are slurped, and everything comes with a dipping sauce, good deep cleaning with a towel is required between every patron. This should really be done at every restaurant everywhere. I will admit, some of the stickiness could be due to the incredibly thick lacquer on the table reacting to hot dishes being placed on it. If that is the case you definitely shouldn't have those tables in a restaurant without tablecloths.  One year later I was hoping to give them a second chance.  The table was even stickier then the year before. I wiped it down with my napkin and some water. The stickiness felt hard and crunchy like it had been left to fester since the last time I was in. As I tried to spoon the broth, I needed to tip the bowl. This was nearly impossible to do without pulling so hard to free it from the table's glutinous grasp that you nearly dump the soup into your lap. Luckily one of my dining companions had figured out a twist and tip method, where you twisted the bowl hard enough to loosen it, then you tip it enough to spoon the broth. Thanks Jake.  Twist and Tip. Twist and Tip. This is no way to live.  I elected to get the Restaurant Week meal which started with Buns, dumplings and a bowl of Ramen with a Ice cream filled mochi. All this for $25. Another dining companion, the intelligent observer ordered buns, dumplings and a bowl of ramen off the regular menu.  First came the Buns, I got one Spicy pulled pork dumpling. The filling was great, very good flavor, nice level of spiciness. However the Mantou didn't seem particularly fresh, I don't know if they steamed a bunch off and let them sit around for too long or if they were buying in frozen ones (thats my guess), but I was fairly disappointed by the bun itself.  My intelligent observer received his nice order of two spicy pilled pork dumplings.  My four Pork and Chive dumplings were wonderful, very good filling, but clearly they had been out of the steamer for a few minutes too long, You can't really fault them though, we were in a group of 13 which makes timing that much more difficult.   My intelligent observer received his nice order of six dumplings and loved his as well  Finally my bowl of Tonkatsu ramen arrived. Traditional Tonkatsu ramen broth is one of the most luxurious and amazing broths I have ever tasted. It has to be simmered for more then 12 hours and is extremely labor intensive.   The broth at Umami was... lacking. It didn't have the body or the complexity of a great Tonkatsu broth. Even worse, the first time I went in a year ago it was almost inedibly salty. After choking down a few spoonfuls I let the rest get scooped up by a server. I tasted a friend's Tonkatsu broth as they were taking mine away... perfectly seasoned.   This year it tasted, horror of horrors, that they may have added some cream to make the stock the correct smoky pale color rather then boil the broth for the more then 12 hours required for great tonkatsu broth. Umami doesn't make their own noodles, instead they contract RP's pasta, a local Italian pasta maker. http://www.rpspasta.com/ They make great italian noodles and I love to pick up a package for dinner as often as possible! However in my mind, a great ramen shop should really be making their own noodles in-house by someone who only makes ramen noodles. It is an art and one that takes years to master.  My intelligent observer also got a bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen.  Finally the meal finished with an Ice Cream filled Mochi and a half. This was very tasty, and very familiar. I love to buy these at the store too! A 6 pack for 2.99 at Trader Joes! These were straight out of the package.  My intelligent observer was quite full, and to be honest so was I. Lets compare our meals.  He had 2 pork buns, I had 1. He had 6 dumplings, I had 4, we both had the same Ramen(similar portions) and I had $0.75 worth of Mochi. Lets look at the bills!  His bill Bun($7), Dumplings ($6), Ramen ($12) = $25 Mine was... wait $25? If we had both gotten a different type of Ramen he would have paid a dollar less then me.  To me that just feels kind of... greasy. !!Maybe that's whats on the table, the owner's greedy grease!! Let me be clear, I wasn't unhappy with the amount of food I got for $25, it was a filling meal and not a bad price point (I wouldn't be back but it doesn't have anything to do with the price) But handing the regular menu out with this... \"deal\" for restaurant week just left me feeling a little taken advantage of."}
{"text":"Worest experience ever. Made a reservation for eight people. Eight people arrived on time, stand there and waited for almost an hour. Still no place to eat. So we left for another restaurant. Wasted us 8*1hour. Don't let them waste your time too."}
{"text":"Perhaps I am spoiled by my last ramen experience, but Umami was just \"okay\" to me. The pork belly, soup and noodles were all less tasty than other ramen restaurants I've tried. This place is also a little more expensive than I'm used to."}
{"text":"True to what many have suggested, the pork buns on the menu are delicious. We had the special shoyu ramen and the chicken shitaki mushroom dumplings.  Enjoyed every bite!     I can't wait to see what type of construction is going on in the front porch area.  Outdoor seating, perhaps?"}
{"text":"On your first trip to Umami Ramen & Dumpling Bar, you may drive by without realizing you've passed the restaurant - at first glance, it appears to be a residence. Upon closer examination, you will see torches, patio furniture, and diners enjoying delicious cuisine and beverages.  We started our evening with saketinis (the Lychee was especially delicious) at the sleek bar inside the small restaurant. After a brief wait for a table (there is limited seating, but without reservations on a Saturday night, we waited less than 15 minutes) we were seated on the patio where we enjoyed the lighted torches and wooden bench seating.  Umami offers a variety of salad options, featuring such ingredients as mushrooms, walnuts, cranberries, and fresh arugula. The Ramen options include meat as well as a vegetarian option. I had the miso ramen, which was rich and flavorful with green onions, thick broth, and slices of chicken. I didn't save room for dessert, but I'll definitely be back to Umami to try their selections on another occassion.  The food and drinks were delicious, and the ambience was unlike any other restaurant I've been to in Madison - understated, classy decor; spot-on service; and an overall upbeat, fun vibe."}
{"text":"Decent ramen and dumplings. Meh service, ok exterior. A thoroughly average ramen/asian joint. Reasonable prices.  Potstickers are pretty good, always get flavor bombs if you order ramen. I really enjoy the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Overall, i'd say that I like Umami. It's certainly a different setting, as it feels like you're eating at a house rather than a business establishment. The large patio makes it a warm weather destination, as you're almost guaranteed outdoor seating. The service is fairly quick and also fairly pleasant. The dumplings are yummy. The buns are yummy, especially the spicy tofu. Especially since we're in Madison, where it seems to be impossible to get a freshly baked Chinese bun anywhere (someone tell me of a spot if you know it!). So, even just the fact that they serve good buns makes it a destination in this fair city.  Although I like most of Umami's offerings, one thing that bums me out about Umami is how disappointing I find their Ramen to be. This could very well be that I just don't like Ramen, but I find it difficult and time consuming to eat, to the point where it's cold by the end. It's also surprisingly lacking in flavor. I realize you can order spice/garlic bombs to spruce it up, but I don't like the idea of having to pay for flavor for my dish. The broth makes up for the lack of noodle/tofu taste a bit though.  The Ramen is the only dish there that I feel is appropriate for getting as an entree, as the buns/dumplings are more small plates. So, it deters me from coming here frequently. But, despite that, you can definitely have a good meal at Umami on occasion. I'd give a 2 for the Ramen, but a 5 for everything else. So, let's say a 4!"}
{"text":"We love the vegetarian selections here. Especially the dumplings"}
{"text":"Special drinks are great.  The dumplings were good and seaweed salad as well. The ramen noodle bowls which is their specialty are nothing special. You could make these at home with your $0.20 pack of ramen noodles and some other items. The meat in the bowls was half fat.  The main meal was disappointing."}
{"text":"\"Let's get some Japanese food\"  \"I love sushi\"  \"I meant ramen\"  \"Oh\"  I wrote a bunch of paragraphs about how the ramen here is between decent to great. It's probably too salty for Midwesterners. It might be too fatty, too. For me, I'd rather have more salt and fat. The bao, mantou, or steambun however you want to call it - those guys were good, too.  But I don't really write reviews to tell people what's up and convince them to go to places.  Food inspires me to talk about things. And Japanese noodles in Wisco is a good start. Asian noodles riff off each other all the time, and they're constantly changing and evolving. Ramen itself was an import to Japan, and it has been undergoing more changes to its formula than almost any food. But Madison doesn't seem to take many food risks. This is a ramen shop that would be equally at home in Milwaukee or Chicago, but it's here in Madison. This place could be uniquely Madison by sourcing its products more locally (go RP's) or it could portray the idea of what Madison food *is*.  That second idea is interesting in that to me Madison food at the moment is Wisconsin food in general. It's the Old Fashioned. We have a burgeoning 'food scene' but that's for hipsters and exclusionary. There are a few standouts like Pel'Meni or Banzo, but in general it seems like most places in Madison that have tried to do something different and not established can't find any traction. I was going to bring this back to Umami and how I wish they did hipper ramen like you see in bigger cities, but I think that's an unfair burden. This is Madison, and foreign food is foreign food. We can't have too much of that.  I digress. I'm sure I'll eat here again and I'm sure I'll talk more about Madison food. Some other time tho."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the interior design. Old Willy house on the outside, but then transformed to a syfy ramen bar inside.  Service was bad. First our waitress waited on another table that had been seated after us. She disappeared for long periods of time and had to find her once. Never broke a smile.  For appetizers we got the veggie dumplings & pork buns. The dumplings were uninspiring & felt we could get better ones at a chinese takeout place. The pork buns helped to turn the meal around. Right amount of hoisin, buns were pillow soft, great crunch from the cucumbers and the pork belly was melt in your mouth tender.   Got the miso, veggie and tonkotsu ramens. All had great depth of flavor & non were too salty. Put did think the veggie one was could use a little something more. Didn't like that you have to pay a $1 for a spicy bomb that was only a couple of tablespoons of chili sauce that at any other restaurant is just on the table.  All in all will come back for the ramen & buns but will stay clear of the veggie items and hope to get better service."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I had the shoyu ramen and shrimp dumplings and both were to die for. I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area with a very large Asian population and authentic Asian restaurants and I still prefer Umami when I come back home. I prefer umami over the Bay Area restaurants any day!!"}
{"text":"My anaconda don't want none unless you got umami buns hun. Their buns are outrageously good here. I always get the pork buns but I have tried their Ramen before. It's okay, lots of flavor but the noodles are harder than what I'm used to. The servers are super nice and they have a lot of specialty drinks here. But for real though you should try the buns here."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2 if it wasn't for the first two times I got the hot buns. Even though the hot buns are nice and tasty it is not the best I've ever had. There should be more stuffed inside. The bun overpowers any deliciousness that is inside the bun.  Tonight I got Miso Ramen. It is the worst I have ever had! It is bitter and just fails on so many different levels. The ramen noodles are subpar and the Miso wasn't even hot. I actually had to microwave it once I got home and I only live five minute walk away. I do believe this is my last attempt at this place I will be moving on which is sad because of how close it is. Plus I got a view of the kitchen and how people worked as I waited for my food. :-("}
{"text":"Love this place! Food was delicious, very tasteful.  We were on the waiting  list but the wait was a fourth of the time. What a surprise! Solved the food craving"}
{"text":"I was very excited about this place because they had a lot of vegetarian items on the menu. Indeed, when I arrived, I ordered the spicy tofu buns and the veggie ramen. The buns were flavorful and extremely satisfying. It seems like most ramen places in Chicago don't have much of a veggie bun selection. The veggie ramen, however, was not that great. I've definitely had better. It was kind of flavorless, and I asked for hot sauce. The hot sauce would have cost $1, but I think the waitress waived that. All in all, I was underwhelmed by the food here."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group and ordered their miso ramen with a hokkaido cocktail.  My drink was delicious and I would love to come back and enjoy their drinks.  There were several more on their list that I wanted to try.    However, the ramen was nothing special.  It wasn't exciting.  We also split some appetizers which were dumplings and pork buns. The pork belly buns were also just okay, not flavored enough, and I prefer the Graze's."}
{"text":"I think that this place is overrated.  The food is very mediocre.  The first time that I came here with my partner, it was shortly after the place opened.  We both ordered different things and were both unsatisfied.  The ramen was just bland somehow and underwhelming.  I figured that maybe the restaurant was just getting it's groove since it's new.  I tried again last year and felt the same way about the food.  It's definitely decent, just not great.  The service has always been friendly.  For ramen, I would go to Sushi Box."}
{"text":"After going to places in California, New York and even Washington D.C this place did not seem to even come close. The ramen did not taste as good as it looked, the flavor was a little more bland than anything else.  but the best part of the meal was definitely the buns, those were really good. We got both the pork belly and the bulgogi buns. and if you had to chose one, well DON'T get both! I promise you it will probably be the best part of your meal!  Service was okay, waitress didn't really come back to check on us after bringing our food. She also didn't give us the information that the other customers got.  If I were to go here again, I'd just get different flavor buns as my entree."}
{"text":"Take-out experience:  Overall ambience - The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. It is a very trendy and hippie place.   Food - I had tonkotsu ramen and it definitely has the umami taste to it. The broth is very rich but sadly not as flavorful as I expected. The umami flavor was the main and almost only flavor to the ramen."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of my favorite places in Madison. The bulgogi beef buns are incredible! The ramen is amazing, and enough to split. I highly recommend this place. Every guest we have every taken here has love it."}
{"text":"Went to dinner at Unami with my husband.  We ordered the special appletizer (Korean BBQ sticky bun), and it was awesome.  Also ordered an large order of dumplings (chicken and Shitake) as well as an order or Ramen (pork).  The entrees were good, but not over the top.  I'd return again, but I can't say it's my favorite Asian restaurant.  Service was very good; waitress was very patient with our questions.  Very cool that they source their noodles from down the street!  We were told previously that it isn't a good place for kids.  While I didn't see a kid's menu, I did see other kids there, and they certainly were welcome.  We didn't bring our kids this time, but wouldn't hesitate to bring them in the future."}
{"text":"Great place! Parking in the back and plenty of street parking. Nice modern space, casual but COOL.  From service to appetizers to main dish to dessert...5 stars because it was very very very very very good!  Dumplings - Crisp, juicy, but not drippy and greasy. Flavorful filling.  Pork Buns! - Amazing with roasted pork belly. I could have a meal with a couple of orders and would be happy!  Tonkotsu Ramen  $12 and Worth every penny!! \"rich pork broth with fresh ramen noodles topped with flavor infused egg, braised pork, marinated bamboo shoots, nori (seaweed) and green onions\" - perfect description and combination of food and flavor in my bowl - which i emptied quickly, yup empty, tipped the broth back, like a kid with a bowl of milk watching Saturday cartoons!  Green Tea Creme Brulee - i wasn't sure what to expect...WOW, so good! Creamy and pretty.  The service was prompt and friendly and split our bill over 3 credit cards without hesitation.  My entire group enjoyed every morsel of food and every drop of broth. I look forward to returning and also finding the food trailer sometime."}
{"text":"Living in Japan for 3 years I ate ramen probably twice a week. And after I came back I have struggled to find a ramen place that didn't taste like sewer water mixed with top ramen. This is that place! Umami was fantastic! The bartenders and servers were very nice and their recommendations were dead on. I finished my first bowl of deliscious ramen and tried to down another but to no avail. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. But it made for a great midnight snack, especially with the rolls I got to go, which were just as good as the ramen and the house sak√®."}
{"text":"Last time we visited Madison, our hosts took us to this lovely spot for lunch.  It was hopping and humming just after opening, but the servers were very attentive, friendly, and helpful even though they were obviously swamped.  I'm not a big devotee of bao, but they executed them well; what impressed me the most was a creative and flavorsome cocktail menu.  It's also a beautiful space, especially if you're able to sit outside.  I'd like to go again and give the food another shot; I might have been a bit too buzzed to give it a fair hearing."}
{"text":"I finally tried Umami after months of wanting to go there. After trying Ramen Kid, I was a little nervous to try ramen again, but Umami did not disappoint!   I loved the atmosphere there- the decor was modern and the lights were tinted giving a romantic/ formal feel. The Japanese decor was also flowed very well with the atmosphere.   I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and my friend ordered the Miso Chicken Ramen both with spicy bombs ($1 extra). The food came out pretty fast! The Shoyu Ramen was perfect. It had the perfect amount of salt and the perfect ratio of noodles to soup. The pork was the cooked to the 't', it was soft but not too soft. The bamboo shoots were fresh and flavored with a little mix of savory and sweetness. All the other vegetables tasted fresh as well. Would definitely recommend for anyone who is looking to try ramen in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  THE GRUB:  Decent... The potstickers are not outstanding, but good. The veggie ramen was very umami (p.s. umami translates to savory), which is hard to do with a veggie dish.   THE DRINKS: Saki cocktails are a rare and delicious treat, and can be found at Umami.   SERVICE:  Great. We visited on one of the early spring days, and opted for outside seating. The hostess warned us that it might get a bit cold later on in the night, and if all seats are taken indoors, they won't be able to re-seat us. Very thoughtful of her! The server was very friendly, attentive, but not over-bearing!"}
{"text":"I wasn't as big of a fan of this place before, but I've come around more lately.  Speaking objectively, this is probably the best place to get ramen in town. Their broths are rich in both texture and unique flavor and their noodles are filling yet bouncy. I don't find their toppings to be very good most of the time, but that's not as important as broth. I personally prefer Ramen Kid, but I don't think a lot of people would agree with me.  What I like even more are their pork buns. Two thick, melt-in-your mouth slices of braised pork belly with sweet, salty hoisin sauce and two paper-thin slivers of briny pickles to balance out the fattiness from the pork belly are nestled in a soft, sweet, and fluffy steamed bun. They're heavenly!  I'm not the biggest fan of their brunch because the broths available at brunch are weird (soy milk in my ramen?!), but I like the omurice because it's full of bacon and it comes with a delicious salad of spring greens and lime ponzu sauce.  Overall, I'd say Umami is a fun place to eat. Their dishes are creative and unique.  *UPDATE* I recently returned because I was craving their thick tonkotsu broth, but I found it to be kind of flavorless. I was really disappointed, and I'm not sure if it's because they've gotten worse at making broth or because I've recently been eating really good ramen elsewhere. Their noodles are still pretty good though; they're not overly soft."}
{"text":"Ladies night out. We arrived at 5 and by the time we left the place was full. The buns are a must try.  One would expect them to be like gummy Wonder bread but I liken the experience of biting in to one as to taking a nip of a dense cloud. We shared a spicy pulled pork version and enjoyed it very much.  I enjoyed the seaweed salad, albeit a bit too sweet for me. A squeeze of lime could have done wonders. All dishes, though lovely and quite tasty, were too salty for each of our tastes, so be forewarned if you watch your intake. Only downside was the fight to hang on to my soup bowl as I slowly ate it.  I think they wanted our table and were hovering a bit too much at the end.  We felt that we were rushed out the door."}
{"text":"Dumplings are the best I've ever had! Wonderful atmosphere and environment inside the restaurant. Can't beat their prices either. We have made this a weekly occurrence. The place itself is rather small inside so if there is a larger group (or louder individuals) prepare to listen to them all night."}
{"text":"We were first time eaters here and they knew it. We asked what the buns were for goodness sake. Our questions weren't answered terribly well though so we could have ordered better with some help.  The mojito was the best drink I had in Madison all week. The staff was nice, the patio was pleasant.  We ordered some pork buns, veggie and pork dumplings and I got Ramen. I really wish they had mentioned that unless you order some of the toppings the ramen is pretty bland. Later a friend said, oh yeah, you are meant to order some of the special additions listed below for your ramen. Aah...it was so bland without it we didn't even eat it.  Out of everything we had the only item that had wow factor was the mojito. Everything else was ok or good.  It wasn't terribly expensive, $15 ea for more food than we could eat and one alcoholic bev. Dang, wish I had known about the toppings."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating the opening of the new noodle place Umani since I read about its conception. Having studied the history of ancient Japanese art culture in college has made me a bit of a Japanophile due to the subtle approach they take in all things beautiful; and Umami pulls this off.   My daughter and I went there for lunch and sat next to the blooming orchid in the  alcove near the entrance. (Good for a escape route with an almost 3-year old). We were greeted right away and made to feel welcome. We choose one of three lunch combination options. The Miso Udon with Roast Pork soup (other choices include chicken and shitake) and the Chicken and Shitake Dumplings for ten bucks (other choices are pork, chicken and chives & veggie). They were nice enough to bring us edamame that wasn't on the menu.   The Soup was out of sight. Although I wish it were hot I know that is sacrilege to a Miso which survives to be the most nourishing at a certain temperature. The noodles were perfect. The Pork melted in my mouth. I had to ask about the infused egg which was quite honestly,  a turn-on. An almost hard boiled chicken egg with a creamy center but not runny. It had a dark liquid running through it which the waiter couldn't explain to me.   Which brings me to the service. Of corse Umami is still working out the kinks of what a new restaurant brings and I understand that. So I can overlook the waiter not knowing how to describe something, especially when it's so damn good. But what's hard to comprehend is the counter service. In a day and age where people don't have money to tip but still want to dine out, a lot of counter service joints have sprung up. But Umami lends itself to table service. I don't want my dumplings or soup to get cold while I go up to order another Sake. And even more important, I might not order another Sake because I have to get up and leave my food and my experience!  The experience is lovely here. With wall accents of ripe and unripe persimmon colors and the slate grey bar with bamboo inspired tile. The place is simple and sophisticated with and great ambient music and discrete lighting. It's just so wonderful that I want someone to bring me my drink so that I can take it all in and not put it on pause. I dream of going back without a child to get a buzz that only good sake can give, and to try the Ahi tuna seaweed salad and the braised pork belly buns with homemade hoisin sauce."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to stop by Umami's restaurant after having their delicious Bao's at the Farmer's Market. My overall experience was just average.   The Food   Our order consisted of a Brunch Ramen, and 2 Pork Belly Bun. I'd have to say the Brunch Ramen was something new, it consisted of bacon bits, egg, pork belly, and some sides such as cabbage, bamboo, and garlic. The broth was flavorful but just Luke-warm. Egg was cooked perfectly, not overcooked, still a bit runny just the way it should be. Pork belly wasn't the best, the fat to meat ratio was off; there was little to no fat It felt like I was eating a normal piece of pork. Bacon as a topping was new, I probably wouldn't get it again; it diluted the flavor of the broth and every bite tasted like bacon.   The Buns Same issue, Pork belly was not fatty enough. Although the Buns were perfect still a bit moist, soft, and still hot when served. I remember it tasting 2x better at the farmer's market.   Pricing   Everything was reasonably priced, Ramen was $10 a bowl and then the buns were $3 per.   Service   Server's were very attentive. We were greeted and seated right away, no complaints.  Decor   Restaurant is basically inside an apartment/house like many other restaurants on Williamson street. Very small and comforting atmosphere. They do also have a bar in the middle of the restaruant.   Parking   Small parking lot behind the restaurant, so there's no need to look for parking.   Overall  Pork Belly could have been better.  Baos were great  Ambiance is small and comforting  I'll probably give Umami another try during dinner hours."}
{"text":"I truly wanted to like this place :( I have been spoiled with amazing, good-to-the-last-slurp ramen in Los Angeles and I'm quite familiar with how ramen should taste. Umami sadly pales in comparison. I ordered the Miso chicken ramen which I was looking forward to as many ramen places only offer pork broth and meat. Unfortunately, the broth was bland and the noodles were overly cooked; the only redeeming ingredient was the flavor-infused egg. I also tried the Umami arugula salad which was quite fresh but the dressing on the salad ruined it (too bitter). I gave one extra star because the restaurant ambience is intimate and cute, and it was easy to get outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I'm glad they have a vegan ramen option here- but I was unimpressed, as was my boyfriend. Many authentic and delicious ramen noodles are vegan, so it would help if they would provide a vegan wheat noodle option instead of defaulting to the vegan and gluten-free rice noodle option. I love rice noodles, but it's not exactly what I want when I think ramen. The flavors of the broth were meh, too. My boyfriend has had non-vegan ramen there and said it was just ok."}
{"text":"Ugh. The service. Is it a joke? I want to give zero stars but can't, & I guess that's alright because the saketinis are great and the buns are good. (Although newsflash: the \"spicy bomb\" is a plate with a dollop of sriracha on it for an extra $1). The dumplings and ramen are decent but what does it matter when you're just sitting, with your menus, without even a glass of water for *20* minutes? The service (during restaurant week no less) is so bad that the last time we were there (I had been planning this for over a week; it was my birthday), my husband and I just got up and walked out. Once the hostess seated us she told us our server would explain the restaurant week menu to us shortly. So we waited. And waited. And waited. Because I really wanted a white ice saketini. But my husband and I decided that 20 minutes of being treated like we were invisible was just too damn long. What a bummer. It was our third and last time there. With each visit the service has been worse. And if your server is an older dude with a beard and a manbun? Run. You're not getting served unless it is by dancing youths. Grumble grumble grumble. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Get either the miso soup or the dumplings!    You have never had real miso soup before if you think of the cloudy salty crap from a powder packet that's served in most Japanese restaurants.  Here, they make it for real and it's amazing!  For added fun, get a flavor infused egg!  The dumpling are rocking.  Hot and authentic, you couldn't ask for more.  Try all three sauces!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for brunch on the east side of Madison.  The patio is lovely, nicely shaded.  Sweet lord, the dumplings... Edamame dumpling with spicy sauce (exquisite), the classic pork and chive (oh so good).  Try the spicy tofu buns - pillowy light goodness with fried tofu, pickled cucumbers, spicy scallion salsa and mayo. I always get the Brunch ramen -- with a spicy bomb and garlic bomb.  Hearty flavorful vegan broth is amazing.  A flavor infused egg is heavenly.  Great service, chill vibe, and enough ramen to take home and enjoy the next day (I add a soft fried egg).  Don't forget a ginger peach rum fizz -- a refreshing breakfast beverage for this lady.  The Vietnamese-style iced coffee is also mighty fine.  Go."}
{"text":"Now that there are two ramen places in Madison, I feel it's imperative that the two be compared. This review hopes to answer any questions you might have in deciding whether to go here, Umami, or its competition, Ramen Kid. To test consistently, I ordered a classical Japanese ramen meal - pan-fried pork gyoza and tonkatsu ramen - at both places.   First thing, Umami is pretty. I love the decor, and the bar is really nice. In fact, a lot of people were there for drinks instead of food. But when it comes to food, I am relatively unimpressed with it. Their gyoza was done well, better than at Ramen Kid. The skin was perfectly crisp, and I loved the sauce that came with it (I got the sweet vinegar sauce). However, the ramen itself was not so great. I think they were going for an oilier ramen concept, because the pork slices were quite fatty (which did mean that they were quite tender) and the broth was really heavy. But it was not as properly savory as I would have liked, and not as savory as the ramen at Ramen Kid. Their ramen came with half of a soft-boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and nori. The restaurant also claims that they make their own noodles. That may be so, but that doesn't really excuse you from cooking your noodles through - there was a visible core of uncooked dough in each noodle, which made it taste doughy and chewy*. Finally, I distinctly noticed that there were temperature differences between the broth, pork slices, and bamboo shoots, which makes me suspect that they assembled the dish in a hurry and hadn't properly heated/let the ingredients sit together and equilibrate.  It seems that Umami does everything else besides ramen well, so you might want to come here if you're looking for, say, buns or a drink. Go to Ramen Kid if you want just ramen.  *NB: my Chinese grandmother taught me that you check when Asian noodles are cooked by looking at the ends. Take them out as soon as you can't see any opaque white dough, when the end looks just translucent. Whoever makes Umami's noodles, take note!"}
{"text":"So as it turns out, Umami's beef buns are some of the best things to eat in the WHOLE WORLD! I very much believe that is not an exaggeration. Truly amazing beef buns - so amazing, in fact, that we requested a second order after just 3 bites (2 buns per order). Let me dig down to the delicious details for you.  The Korean BBQ beef used in the bun is incredibly tender with delightfully crispy edges and a wonderful, deep flavor. The spicy mayo has a nice, creamy heat, but not at all overpowering (I'm fairly sensitive to spice) because the thinly sliced cucumbers combined with a soft bun enveloping it all creates a lovely balancing effect. I will crave these buns until the next time I'm there, which I hope is very soon.  The edamame appetizer was exactly what we wanted - nice & warm topped with lots of course salt. And the pork & chive dumplings were also very good with a sweet, tangy dipping sauce. But the beef buns just stole the show, so there it is.  Brittany was our server and she was nothing, but helpful, fun and fabulous. You'll know her by her height, her blonde hair and her adorable dance moves. I was a first timer at Umami and she was full of great info and suggestions. She was attentive and yet knew when to let my friend and I just chat away. The last piece of goodness is that we were there for happy hour so our mixed drinks were 2 for 1. Hooray!  Now be good and go get some beef buns immediately!"}
{"text":"Food: 5 Service: 4 Uniqueness: 4  ---------------------------------------------------------------- So I didn't know what to expect from a ramen joint in Madison Wisconsin but the steamed buns from their food cart by the campus were incredible. As a result my wife and I went to check it out and we're blown away. This place is on par with ramen in San Francisco or Seattle and is probably one of the best places in the midwest.  Definitely try the buns. The porkbelly buns are standard and tasty but the unique ones are the spicy beef buns with cucumber kimchi and spicy mayo. Those are delicious.   The tonkatsu ramen is outstanding! The broth is rich and flavorful and the noodles are perfect. The other ramen broths are ok. We've tried several of the others which are good but not nearly as noteworthy as the tonkatsu."}
{"text":"Great comforting food matched with pleasant service!  We went this past Saturday for a late lunch and boy was this placed packed to its gills! I guess it'd be wise to plan a 30-45 min wait in your schedule when planning this joint esp. in and around peak hours. Here's my thoughts on the food once we did finally get to eat!  Pork Belly Bun - Excellent! The bun was not to spongy nor was it dry. The pork belly was melt in your mouth cooked and the hoisin sauce paired really well with it. Must try!  Tonkotsu ramen - Delicious! The broth was creamy and had a \"soothe your senses\" sort of taste to it. The braised pork was cooked to perfection and really complimented the flavors of the broth. The noodles were light and portioning balanced. The add-ons of Garlic and Spicy bombs really elevated the dish and gave another dimension to it!   Green tea Creme Brulee - Sinful! The green tea wasn't bitter or overpowering the otherwise usually subtle flavor of a typical custard. In fact it was a very good play on flavors and ended up being the Star of our evening!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ramen? In the morning? I'll admit it took me some time to come around to Umami as a brunch option. Friends have talked about how magnificent and unique of a place Umami is for brunch and I finally caved.  First, the Umami bloody mary. Goodness! It is a delicious take on the traditional bloody mary, and for the chance to try a quail egg it is totally worth the upgrade from the standard offering.   I opted away from ramen, and instead tried the Spicy Umami Burrito which I am still daydreaming about currently. The combination of spicy pulled pork, scallion pancake, and kimchi makes for quite the breakfast treat. It never hurts to add in some side dumplings or buns because why not!  Umami's portion sizing is very generous, and I find that I am always taking home leftovers whether it be from dinner or brunch. Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I. love. Umami. It's actually the first restaurant I ever went to in Madison, which really set a high standard for future dining ventures :) Whenever my boyfriend and I can't decide where to eat, we default to Umami. We usually order bottomless matcha tea (though I've tried a few of their cocktails and they're all delicious), the pork & chive dumplings, and the ramen special with a spicy bomb. They have an awesome option to split a ramen entree with extra protein (2 eggs, more pork belly) for just a couple dollars!  The service is always great, the ambiance is cozy, and while I haven't tried the patio yet I am DYING to do so.   Oh, aaand they have brunch on the weekends, which has literally changed my life. I want breakfast ramen and egg & bacon dumplings for every meal, not just every brunch."}
{"text":"Umami always delivers when I am hankering for some solid food.  My go to dishes are usually the pork burns along with the chicken and shrimp dumplings.  I feel the pork buns are some of the best in town.  The fattyness of the pork offset by the sliced cucumbers and hoisin sauce make it incredibly addicting.  This time, my girlfriend and I also went with the tuna poke.  Served with some variation of a chip, the tuna was fresh and evenly sauced with soy and sesame oil.  While I still feel the pork buns ruled the night, the poke was a nice change of pace.  Umami also is one of the few places that serves up Hitachino beer (little owl) so that is always a plus."}
{"text":"I love the dumplings here. The ramen is pretty damn good too. I can't say I like the building much. The staff are friendly and the location isn't bad. My biggest problem is the price. I know it's a higher class ramen, but I could still make it at home and don't want to pay so much. Which would be why I haven't been back."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable last night. I got the Vegan Dumplings. They were recommended by the person who seated us. Super tasty with their hot sauce!  I also ordered some of their Sake. Very good too. They always came by and refilled our waters, too. That was very nice.  Definitely coming back to this place"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, as Melissa J mentioned, is stylish. The lights are fairly low and the noise level is relatively peaceful. It's a very nice and subdued place, which is probably what you'd expect of a more upscale Japanese restaurant lacking a hibachi grill.  I went for the grand opening tonight and I was only slightly disappointed: they have a fixed menu with some limited items. There's appetizers, salads, dumplings, ramen, and some desserts. However, there's only several listed for each type. The drinks list is also fairly limited, but if you're into beer and sake-type drinks, you'll be fairly pleased. There are some alternative beverages, but don't expect a lot of soda, wines, or other types outside of this.  I got myself a glass of the Chardonnay and the tonkotsu ramen. The Chardonnay was a terrible mistake on my end of things: it doesn't seemingly pair well with anything on the menu, so it was a poor decision, in retrospect. Not their fault on this one.  The tonkotsu ramen was good, but not great. It was very mild and soft, but lacked a special flavor. The noodles were good and the char siu pork was incredible. I'd wished they'd put some more in because it'd certainly add some more flavor to the broth.  The service was a little spotty, too: it took us a few minutes to be noticed by a staff member who just told us to sit at a bar. Then, when we did, it took about 15 minutes for us to be asked about ordering anything. I understand it was the first night and some things were probably getting worked out, though.  Overall, it was a great atmosphere and decent food. A little expensive, but not the worst. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday just before the big lunch rush and wasn't disappointed. I was impressed with the extensive menu options despite the fact that Wisconsin may not be known for its ramen shops! All of the waitstaff was extremely pleasant and it seemed like a very \"hipster\" place. Service got a little slow near the lunchtime rush but that wasn't their faults. I was impressed with the vegan, vegetarian, and regular options. Started off with the Thai milk tea. I wasn't a huge fan of it because it seemed overall too creamy without a strong flavor at all.   Next we had the bacon omurice and the brunch ramen. I think part of my 5 star review is that you can't go wrong with bacon. The omurice was very simple in itself. It was nice egg surrounding some rice that consisted of just rice and bacon - very simple but hearty because bacon and bacon fat is delicious.   The brunch ramen was great! I've heard complaints of it being too thin because the brunch broth base does not have any pork, but it was surprisingly savory and perfect for lunch. There was also bacon in it, but the standouts were the bamboo, egg, and pork belly. The pork belly was very very tender and the ramen consisted of all my favorite toppings. The ramen was came out to be a little pricey (there have been better for less - but it's a great little spot in Madison!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch on Sunday at 10 am and started out with the beef steam buns. They were exceptional. I mean I eat food and it tastes good. I also had the bacon dumplings that were just amazing with expert construction and cookery; and the filling was just gooey bacony excellence. The atmosphere was...I don't know because my face was in my food, I could have been siting in blizzard hurricane lightning radioactive apocalypse and I wouldn't have noticed. Also get the spicy mayo with the dumplings, I wanted to swim in it.   Babe got three sides, the rosemary potatoes, eggs over easy, and regular bacon all made perfectly. Service was excellent. I want to go back right now, but I am at work far away from this delicious food...oh the insanity!!!!"}
{"text":"Willy Street delivers again! Umami is that rare experience in Madison that provides an alternative to your usual place. Ramen is given new meaning, and did I mention the pork dumplings? Don't order 6, opt for 9, you'll thank me later. Great, attentive service, excellent, authentic noodles, dumplings, and rolls, Umami is my new go to location on Willy Street."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter on a brisk spring evening.  The atmosphere is both hip and comfortable.  We sat at the bar and began with a perfect martini.  The pork and chive dumplings were outstanding-everything you want from dumplings but seldom find.  They were succulent, light, and flavorful.  I had the tonkotsu ramen and added pork belly and the spicy bomb.  The broth was good and the pork and especially the pork belly was tasty.  The spicy bomb would have benefitted by a more complex mixture of flavors.  My daughter had the miso ramen with chicken.  She felt that it was a bit bland.  We both thought that a runny, rather than hard-boiled, egg would have enhanced the flavors and textures. Service was efficient and friendly.  All told, it was a pleasant and very affordable evening out and perfect for a cold spring day."}
{"text":"Small but good menu. If you like Ramen noodles this is the spot. I like their buns, great style fold over buns with scrumptious fillings. Dumplings also cooked nice with great selection of siblings. My always favorite is the Poker, this is an app size. Good for two. Service prompt , beer bar  cocktail selections awesome."}
{"text":"Always enjoy going to Umami! Try the pork buns and dumplings to start.. or just get a bunch to share along with some cocktails and call it a night! The patio is a lovely place to sit outside on Willy St. and the casual atmosphere is always relaxing. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"our experience was pretty spot-on with the rest of the reviews here.  the pork buns were amazing and the chicken shitaki dumplings were great.  i ordered one of the fruity cocktails and it rocked.  this place would easily be five stars if you just showed up for a cocktail and appetizers.  the ramen, on the other hand, was so incredibly disappointing.  i ordered the vegetable ramen with a garlic bomb and topped with corn.  the noodles were amazing but the broth was so salty that the meal was actually inedible.  it was a deep msg tasting salt that actually hurt my throat to swallow the broth.  so depressing because i LOVE ramen and wanted to write a glowing review.  the folks behind the bar were very friendly when we walked in and we were seated right away for an early friday night dinner.  our waiter was very nice but not very quick on the ball about attending to our needs.  the apps came out in a short amount of time but the ramen took close to 35 minutes - and it was literally us and maybe five other tables at that point.  we know they're not hand-making the noodles and ramen broth (good ramen broth) is a perpetual process...  we found that confusing.  and i'm HAPPY to wait 35 minutes for amazing ramen.  clearly not so happy to wait for inedible salt hell.  i'd go back for the tuna poke and those pork dumplings... damn.  so so good in an otherwise not so great restaurant."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!  We started with the spicy tofu buns and the chicken and shiitake dumplings which were both amazing.  Love the flavors of the pickling and the delicious sauces to dip these in....mmmmmm.  I had the shoyu ramen with a spice bomb, one word \"delicious!\" We also happened to be there for happy hour which was a bonus as it was 2 for 1 rail and tap.  I will definitely be going back as I am already craving the spicy tofu buns!"}
{"text":"Tip: parking behind the house. Didn't know that for my first trip and I parked on the street.   I got the Omurice for brunch with a friend and they got ramen. I really liked the idea of the Omurice but I would say it was very salty because of the bacon. It would have been nice if it was pork belly or just less bacon. The bacon was in large chunks too.  I highly recommend the potstickers with eggs, bacon and chives. This was absolutely delicious. I'm definitely ordering this again.   The service was ok. Our water was refilled just once but my friend ever got a refill on their coffee.  Space. It's intimate. Cute for a date night. Probably not the best for large groups (no more than 8). I am sure it's packed for dinner. Brunch was not so busy at opening time. You can make a reservation via email for brunch. Not sure if this is necessary but do it anyways?   I'll probably go again and this one try their ramen. There are a lot options on their menu. I can't wait to explore some more."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! We came here twice within a couple weeks because it was so good. We came here for brunch and the Ramen was delicious. We also had a burrito as well as the omurice. Every entree we had here was amazing! Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"If I lived on the Eastside, I would probably go broke eating here. Steamed buns, dumplings, and Ramen are all my favorite things to eat and Umami does them all right. I have such a hard time ordering when I go here since everything I have ever tried has been amazing. Dang, now I want to go to Umami now for lunch. If you are reading this still, stop, and just go get yourself some steamed buns from Umami now."}
{"text":"This is one of Madison's best noodle joints. The buns are always good... It's a toss up between the pork or beef buns. In the dumplings, I prefer the pork dumplings over the other varieties.   I think I've sampled most of the Raman - But prefer something with pork in it. The salads are also nice, but given the near zero temp, it was definitely a noodle night. We split the special - of course it had a nice slab of pork belly as one of the protein components.   We also had an order of the spicy beef buns and an order of the pork dumplings. The bill was $30... Not bad for two."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Would be 5 stars if the waitstaff cared. Again Awesome food.   Appetizers came out (we ordered when we were seated) and then we waited about 10 minutes to place our dinner order. They came out at the same time.   Server took over 20 minutes to check on how food was. We asked another server to refill our waters and bring 2 of us forks. She said sure but never returned. We were in no hurry but a 1 hour dinner took almost 2 1/2 hours because the servers seemed to forget us.  but remember the food was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Its a small location, was a home at one point and parking can be tricky. We got lucky with one of the few spots in back. The place is small so does not hold a ton of people. The menu is not loaded with options, mostly appetizers, dumplings and variation of ramen. But everything was super good and for sure made right on sight. We started with the tuna poke that some of the best I have ever had, then some of the little pork bun sandwiches which were great and the platter of pickled vegetables. I had the house special pork ramen with some extra eggs in it. Super good broth. No too rich or fatty. Good house made noodles also. Our party of five loved everything we had. Service was great. Would for sure go here again.,"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we stumbled upon this gem. Located in an old house turned into a restaurant this place has lots to offer. We came for lunch on Sunday. It was pretty crowded but the staff was nice and we ended up not waiting too long at all.  I started off with a guava mimosa! Just based on that alone I would be back. Yumm! They had regular mimosas as well as mango and peach ones. The Bloody Mary was intriguing as well with a quail egg but we passed on this Sunday.  Our waitress was nice and quick to take our order and refill waters. She even made us kid friendly chopsticks for the 8yr old in the group.  We started with the beef buns which were very good. I want to try the spicy tofu ones next time. For entrees I had the tofu kimchi hash and my boyfriend got the brunch ramen. Both things were very good and cooked perfectly. There are also dumplings on the menu which look amazing and veggie and began ramen as well. I was very impressed by how many vegetarian and vegan options they had on the menu. I will definitely be back with my veggie loving friends to try them out! Can't wait to try dinner and their other cocktails!"}
{"text":"Four of us recently had a very lovely Saturday brunch at Umami. The buns are as delicious as always, and the vegetarian options are extensive. My pescatarian friend was overwhelmed by how many choices she had.   Kudos to Umami!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tonkatsu ramen. The broth was milky and relatively flavorful. It was a bit on the salty side. The pork was pretty tender and the egg was cooked just right with the yolk being a little runny. I was a little disappointed with the noodles. They weren't very eggy, chewy, and al dente.   For Madison, I would give the place 3 stars. It can't compare to NYC or California."}
{"text":"In all honesty I was trying to find something to make it so I didn't give this place a five star rating because I give every place a five star rating. But I could not find a single reason!  Everything about this place is wonderful. The staff is very good. From giving great recommendations, to coming to the table often but not too much.  It is also nice that they have so many options for vegetarians and vegans. It is surprisingly hard to find a lot of vegetarian options in a city with so many restaurants. It is nice to have vegetarian options that don't end at salad.  Their collection of cocktails is also wonderful. Every one that I have tried so far is delicious. Light and refreshing with enough flavor that it doesn't taste like I'm drinking straight rubbing alcohol.  If there was anything I would take away a star for, it would be that they aren't open long enough!  I can't wait to try their brunch sometime because I have heard amazing things."}
{"text":"When I see a sub-4 star overall rating on yelp I have certain expectations and I'll often actually avoid the place. But a friend of mine wanted to check Umami out so I checked my assumptions. And I loved it! We went during restaurant week so it was packed at we ate at the bar. The buzz in the place was great and you could tell it was a place where people were having a great time.  Brandon and I ignored the restaurant week menu (simply because it would have been WAY too much food) and we shared an order of the buns, the dumplings, and we split a bowl of ramen. The pork belly buns were delicious. The pork was soft and flavorful and the hoisin sauce was the perfect pair.The dumplings were less remarkable simply because they bore a strong resemblance to Asian Kitchen take out, but I love Asian Kitchen take out, so I thought they were good. The tonkotsu ramen was delicious. This was the part I was most nervous about because people seemed to have the most negative opinions about that. But it was great. The broth was flavorful, the noodles were nice and thin. The egg was absolutely delicious. Even the pork, which was my least favorite part, was nice and salty and added a lot of flavor. On a tip from another yelper, we decided to split a bowl. It's $1.50 extra and they give you separate bowls, extra meat, and an extra egg. Great deal and the perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I gave Umami a try after discussing getting soup. We usually go to Ha Long Bay, which is not a comparison as they are different meals entirely, but we were hoping to expand our soup expertise.  It's weird walking into a house, but the space inside is really quite nice. We were sat in a three table corner, which was a little snug and seemed too close at first, but was actually pretty cozy once seated.  The atmosphere I would give more stars to. It is really quite surprising how nice it is inside and they did a good job utilizing the space.  Staff wise they were very friendly. Our waters were never empty and our waitress, DeAnna, was really friendly.   We started with the pork chive dumplings, which were good. We got the sweet sauce, which had a nice flavor. They were hot, but not too hot, and easy to eat. Cooked very well, but like other reviews say, they were simply just that: dumplings.  Now for the Ramen. I know that it includes Rp pasta, but $11 was way too much for this size bowl. The soup came out, I had the veggie and my boyfriend had the tonkatsu, and it wasn't piping hot. Just a little more than warm. The presentation was nice, but once we dived in we found ourselves pretty underwhelmed. I enjoyed it a first, but the shiitake flavor both in the broth and in the whole mushrooms became very overwhelming about half way. My boyfriend, champ of soups, found the noodles to be a little lack luster but said that the egg in the soup was perfect. The egg was the best part.  I tried veggie because I'm not a huge fan of pork or chicken, but it seemed that maybe the veggie dish required more of a chicken broth to balance out the shiitake mushrooms.  I didn't finish my soup, but was offered a box which was nice. I don't think we will return for soup, but maybe for a drink and an appetizer. We will stick with our Thai noodle soups and continue on out soup journey.  Staff A+ / Space B / Food C-"}
{"text":"We ordered the following for takeout:  1 order of pork buns: I've had these at their cart before, and they are just as tasty at the restaurant. This was the highlight.   2 seaweed salads:  Nicely dressed with some lightly pickled (I think) mushrooms  2 large orders of dumplings (18 total) - classic pork and chive and pork/shrimp combo:  Thoroughly mediocre.  Greasy, overcooked, and slightly dry. It doesn't seem like they serve steamed dumplings, which is a pity. They're not bad, but they're not particularly good either.   The whole thing came to $38. That's too much for a moderate spread of appetizers. I doubt we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"PAT-I-O! This is one of my favorite outdoor dining spots in Madison. Come on people, we live in Wisconsin, we gotta soak up those rays and warmth while we can!  While we're talking about spring, try the spring rolls. They're super fresh and the peanut/spicy sauces are divine.    Annnnd obligatory dumpling mention. I could eat the vegan dumplings every day for the rest of my life and not get bored, but instead fall progressively deeper and deeper in love with them."}
{"text":"the broth was really salty but most ramen places are. Just a regular bowl but then again, coming from Southern California, I've got high standards."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place together on a Friday evening without a reservation. It seemed like we were lucky to find a parking spot in the small lot and upon entering we were surprisingly seated immediately. We ordered the pork buns to share and our own bowls of pork ramen. The pork buns were decent; a little chewy and room temperature. (I thought they were supposed to be hot?) But the ramen was simply delicious and came in a very large portion. My boyfriend completely devoured all of his ramen and I finished as much as I could of mine. The ambience of the small restaurant was cozy but very welcoming and enjoyable. My boyfriend and I were able to enjoy a delectable meal; with the help of our fantastic server who answered all of our questions as first-time visitors and offered his own personal favorites on the menu. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"PROS: Tasty, decent portions and prices CONS: ?  Rather than serving authentic Japanese ramen, Umami leans toward fusion flavors. My piping hot Veggie Brunch Ramen hit the spot. The soy milk in the dashi broth added a new, unexpected dimension to the usual miso-based vegetarian broth. One of these wintry days, I would love to drop by again to explore more items off the menu. For example... dumplings!"}
{"text":"The word \"ramen\" usually conjures up 10 cent instant noodle packs you can buy at the gas station; the main food staple for many college students. However, ramen at Umami is anything but that. My boyfriend and I split a bowl of tonkotsu ramen and a small order of pork and chive dumplings. The dumplings were good, but nothing to write home about. The ramen was pretty good, although the broth was a little on the salty side. I was skeptical about the flavored egg at first because I hate eggs, but I tried some anyway and it was pretty good. The seaweed and braised pork rounded out the flavors in the ramen. Overall, I would recommend Umami for their ramen."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill, I use to love coming here, it had great service, quality food and a wonderful ambiance. The food quality has significantly gone down hill. Both mine and my brothers ramen was missing our pork and we had almost no broth at all. We asked for more and they said they were all out... which is hard to believe at a place that specializes in ramen. I'm sad to say I was underwhelm with the food I use to love coming here. Needless to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious pork dumplings and pork buns were solid too.  Great atmosphere, really hope this place does well.  Their service was a bit spotty--I'm still waiting for that booster seat the host told me he's bring me for my little son.  The food was great, so I'll look past it."}
{"text":"This is some decent ramen, but for the price I definitely prefer some of Madison's other offerings. The tonkatsu ramen is alright, but not amazing. The broth is too salty and garlicky for my taste, and very concentrated, which can get pretty overwhelming very quickly. I added pork belly and shiitake mushrooms, both of which were delicious, and I love the bamboo shoots, which have a wonderful texture and taste, but the pork it comes from was over cooked, dry, and tough. The noodles were nothing special.   The buns are my favorite things here, I love how soft and fluffy they are, and the shiitake and pork dumplings are also very good. If that's what you're looking for, it's a decent place to go, but there is better ramen for cheaper kn the area."}
{"text":"First time eating ramen and it won't be my last. It was the perfect meal for an extremely cold day in Madison. The beef buns were off the chain! The beef was seasoned perfectly. It was a just a tad bit dry however. Whatever dough they use for the buns would put pillsbury to shame! Take the dough boy!   I had the miso ramen which came with chicken and extra noodles. Loved the infused egg and flavor. My only complaint was the broth. I am not sure if this is something of ramen but it was murky and thick. Preferably, my broth is light almost like a tea consistency.   Overall, great dish, fantastic service and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Completely disappointing. I had my doubts when we had trouble finding the place at night because the only sign they have is wooden with an inscription of a bowl in it.  Then we get inside. It looks pretty nice, that kind of urban hipster looking with a bar that seems pretty popular these days. Being the decisive people we are we order with relatively alacrity and then proceed to wait close to 20 minutes for our appetizer and then another 20 minutes for our entree. This is completely unacceptable, how long can it take to prepare a bowl of ramen?  As for the taste, the pork belly appetizer was pretty good though I found it kind of skimpy on the pork and really, how do you mess up pork belly?  Our bowls of ramen on the other hand were atrocious; muddy looking broth, a little too salty and basically no other flavor except a bitter aftertaste.  The pieces of meat were equally flavorless and boring.  The service however was good and when we complained the manager came out to get our opinions. Frankly, the food was beyond redemption, no amount of critiquing was going to allow the chef that prepared that ramen to cook something delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent Dinner and a pretty reasonable price. Mom and I  had the seaweed salad, chicken dumplings and split the miso ramen.  All the food was wonderful!  The seaweed salad was a wonderful surprise -  light, delicious and flavorful.  The ramen was also excellent - wonderful broth,  the meat was succulent and the noodles were firm and tender."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and had a blast!!! The location is small and actually located in a house, but has seating inside and outside on a deck.  The parking is in the back with about 5-6 spots available for cars.  We arrived with out a reservation, but were seated almost immediately on a Sunday night during Restaurant Week.  They had a great selection of cocktails, local beers, and significant wine list.   We ordered a few appetizers.  The fried tofu dish was ok...kind of smooshy in a soy sauce...didn't really care for it.  The seaweed salad was excellent, with marinated seaweed over shiitake mushrooms.  The spring roll was also well put together with dipping sauces.   We absolutely loved the Veggie and Spicy Veggie buns.  The buns were perfectly cooked with an incredible sauce on the inside that almost makes my mouth water thinking about it.  The spicy wasn't really all that spicy, but taste SOOOOO good.  The combination of the soft bread, cucumbers, and fried tofu...amazing.  The veggie dumplings were also well done with the crispy crust and  chewy top.  Also filled with a nice assortment of diced vegs and tofu.  The Veggie Ramen was good.  I am not a huge fan of Ramen, but the addition of the spice bomb, and garlic bomb was excellent.  The smoked tofu and noodles were cooked well, and the soup surrounding it was flavorful.  We also tried the mango ice cream Mochi which was o.k.  Overall this is a great noodle shop in Madison.  What I really loved was the attentive service.  Our waiter was getting killed with it being restaurant week and the place being packed, but he NEVER let our water glasses get empty.  He brought the food out in a perfectly timed method that allowed us to enjoy each dish.  Just plain excellent service."}
{"text":"The ramen was nothing to write home about--that being said, the pork belly buns and bulgogi buns we ordered as our appetizer were AMAZING. I'm talking melt-in-your-mouth-oh-my-god-do-i-want-twenty-more amazing! They were marinated to perfection and the meat was tender. Minus 1 star only because of the \"meh\" ramen and sticky tables.  (+) Pork belly & bulgogi buns A MUST (+) Small yet cozy with outdoor seating  (-) Sticky tables (-) Ramen was just ok"}
{"text":"Way too salty. Despite that, the Ramen was not bad, but really good places have a more refined broth that relies less on salt for taste. Paying 50 ¬¢ for a dollop of hot sauce (their \"Spice Bomb\") that is free at most places was kind of a turn off. However it was a nice place with a cozy, nice ambience and great server."}
{"text":"Need to update after having better experiences. In particular, Umami offers an awesome restaurant week special.  Even my favorite restaurants tend to disappoint me during restaurant week. The portions are small, not nearly as good as usual and often aren't what the restaurant usually serves. They're dishes designed to be made in bulk, and probably cost less to make. Umami's restaurant week is superior in that they serve the most popular dishes on the menu, unchanged, for a great price - at $25, it's amongst the cheaper restaurant week meals.  The buns are phenomenal. I got the Korean beef and ate it in about two bites. The pork dumplings were very good and the Tonkotsu ramen was amazing. I don't remember it being so good! Definitely worth purchasing a spicy bomb. Enough food in there for two meals.  Took awhile to seat us but both the hostess and our waitress were friendly and smiled. Glad to see the improvement!"}
{"text":"I order Ramen Noodle with Chashu Pork.  It was cold and in December, you had to get soupy something to stay warm.  The food was really delicious, the food came out quickly.  The customers sitting at the bar alongside me were very friendly.  The prices were reasonable.  Large Portions.  If you're visiting Wisconsin Dells, Wi, get your food here before you go because there is no good asian place in Wisconsin Dells.  It's an hour to wisconsin dell.  The food was really good."}
{"text":"Nice patio to enjoy the warm day in Madison. Yummy Ramen with Pork Buns with Thai Iced tea. The vegetarian Ramen The broth tasted authentic but I was expecting a variety of veggies in the soup. I'm just spoiled from the Seattle Ramen restaurants. I'll come back for another bowl and ask for extra veggies.  t-shirts were cool.. I'll buy 2 for my girls."}
{"text":"I really like Umami. I love the pork buns, the pork belly brightened by the tangy sauce, and the freshness of the scallions and pickles cucumbers nicely counters the fat. It's really the perfect combination in a single bite.   As for the ramen, I always get the tonkotsu, and I really really love the way they do their meat. I love pork fat. The broth is super rich and creamy without being weighted down, the eggs are always cooked perfectly rare and the bamboo slices are nicely marinated. I strongly feel that they are levels above other ramen establishments in town in terms of understanding the ingredients and execution. That said, the broth is a bit too salty for my taste, to the point that it leaves a slight bitter after taste. I wish they can hold back on the salt a little so it doesn't distract from all the other wonderful things in the bowl. Comparing to their competitions, though, they are outstanding.   Umami will continue to be my family's asian restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"Good food. Good value. Really good service. The menu is really cool - it is super eclectic and you will find something unexpected. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good pork belly buns. The best tonkatsu ramen you will get in Wisconsin. Nothin compared to all the real authentic and delicious tonkatsu ramens in other cities, but when desperation hits, this does it. There's a small parking lot in the back and ambience is small and cute. Outdoor seating is really popular"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the Umami Buns food cart and was SUPER EXCITED (more so than I probably should have been) to find out there was a brick-and-mortar restaurant, too! I was already in love with ramen cuisine and I enjoyed exploring Umami's menu! The Pear Blossom sake-tini is wonderful for drinks and I had the pork dumplings, edamame, and miso ramen. Very cute interior, too :)"}
{"text":"This place is a completely solid 3.5 stars, but I'm going to round up because it has a small parking lot! It's pretty hard to find parking there (I guess only 6-7 cars could fit there), but it's better than nothing.   The ramen here is relatively good, the dumplings are relatively good, but nothing spectacular. I'm very confused when I see reviews about this being the best ramen they've had - it's certainly nothing special, but it will satisfy your ramen/dumpling craving!  It's honestly quite a small establishment, I was surprised! It's probably not good if you have a group of 5 or more...but you CAN make reservations for a group of 5 or more which is pretty cool! I would say that this place is pretty great for a date night.   The service was fine, relatively fast at getting the food out and refilling drinks, but otherwise it's just another ramen place."}
{"text":"UpDate!  The service was WAY quicker this time around! And our waiter recognized us (it's only our 2nd time and at least 3 wks in between) - I liked the greeting.   I ordered o-Cha (honey tea + Maker's Mark + mint leaf) deserves thumbs up. My bf and I shared bunch of appetizers and gyoza and skipped ramen. Everything tasted good! I loved the variation on veggie pickles. This time, the pickle plate included un-riped mango, jicama, and beets etc etc, which were all crunchy-delish.  With 5 plates and a drink, our dinner tab was ~ $40. Not bad at all :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous setting (with parking) and great food.  I had the special dumplings (pur√©ed edamame) and the summer roll.  Dinner for $13 and it was a spectacular flavor bomb."}
{"text":"The food and service was really good. I agree with some of the other reviews which say that the ramen doesn't really compare with ramen places in other parts of the world (I haven't been to Japan but I have been to a few pretty authentic places in NYC and Hawaii). That being said, it's still a great meal. I didn't try the pork buns, but that's definitely on my list when I go back (emphasis on the *when*)."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for its Ramen and how quaint and cute the inside/outside is. From the appearance it is pretty safe that at one point it was a house that has been converted into a restaurant. As so the ambiance is very intimate, at most there is a table or two you can see and hear.   The menu features mainly buns, dumplings and ramen. There is also appetizers and some salads but everyone comes here for the ramen. My favorites on the menu are the spicy tofu buns and Miso Ramen. The tofu in the buns is crispy on the outside and cooked to perfection with slaw and a spicy mayo. All this is wrapped in the perfect fluffy bun.   The Miso Ramen is a miso base with chicken stock, chicken, noodles, flavor infused egg, bamboo shoots,and lots of great flavor. You can also add extras such as a spicy bomb(as usually get this), garlic bomb, extra meat, extra egg, etc. This is nice as you can make the dish very unique if you want. The ramen itself is rich and complex in flavor. It is the perfect thing on a cold rainy day. The only thing I do not like is it can be very salty but that comes with the territory.   Another thing to add is there saketini's are awesome. If you are a Sake fan I would highly recommend trying one.  Overall if you are looking for a restaurant that is different than your usual Wisconsin stop this is absolutely a must try. Once you try it you will become one of there many regulars."}
{"text":"Cool hip little place with interesting wall paintings (think murals of people swimming in bowls of ramen) and creative brunch offerings.  Perfect place to eat for brunch the next morning  after a late night - hits the spot!! The brunch menu is really creative and a bit asian fusion-y. They also have your standard waffles for the less adventurous (or pure breakfast souls) :) The portions are sizeable which is great!  They have 3 things essentially thay they're known for- the ramen, dumplings,  and the pork buns. Only had ramen and buns which were both awesome- so I recommend getting pork buns on the side and ramen as a main. You will be very full and satisfied.   The pork buns are good-- could maybe benefit from a little more sauce and green onion filling but overall really juicy pork belly and soft fluffy buns.   The ramen was really delicious-- especially the broth. Was not overly salty and was very flavorful. The noodles were perfectly Al dente and the variety of veggies was great.  So yummmmm!!!  Would most definitely go back and would probably be a regular if I lived here!"}
{"text":"white people sure love this place.  buns = ehhh dumplings = why not cocktails = no way ramen = aye caramba blergh"}
{"text":"HOLY YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just Yaaassssss!  LOVE the Ramen so much had the pork one.... OMG I just cant even describe! MUST TRY"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the veggie ramen! it was delicious and it came it quickly. My server Leah was very attentive and one of the nicest servers I have ever had. I recommend this place and getting Leah as server. I will be going back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Cozy ramen bar serving limited but perfectly nice menu of ramen, dumplings and pork buns. There is a children's menu with nice selections, but if you think you are going to get chicken fingers and pizza, go elsewhere. Our well-behaved seven-year-old was perfectly fine here. Decor was spare and certainly kept some of the spirit of the original house."}
{"text":"Went here last night and I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from the pork in the ramen. I went home and two hours later I felt nauseous and vomited. Food was mediocre, and the broth was lukewarm which was probably why the pork was undercooked"}
{"text":"Points for being a rehabbed home, but that's where most of the excitement stops. Staff has never been all to welcoming/friendly/warm/suggestion-oriented and honestly up and down Willy I can get some pretty mean dumplings at a number of places. Their buns are tasty though, I'll give them that, but I just don't think it's worth the trip for one specialty item."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a staple of my diet for years.  I recommended this restaurant years ago, and I would still again.   Order the Tonkotsu ramen and the pork belly buns."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner and drinks here to round out a weekend visiting Madison. There was a little bit of a wait as their kitchen was apparently under-staffed for the day but nothing that was unreasonable.   The restaurant itself has a nice and homey feel and the wait-staff was super friendly!  We ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodles and a spicey bomb and the Pork and Chives dumplings. The Ramen was delicious!! The noodles were perfectly cooked and with the spice bomb the broth was the perfect level of spicy! The egg was also perfectly cooked in the ramen which is always a nice surprise. The dumplings were also quite tasty and the spicy dipping sauce it comes with hit the spot!   We rounded out the night with a few mango mojitos which were a perfect refresher on a hot night!   Overall I was a huge fan of this place! The Ramen was spot on!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Umami last night after walking past it a thousand times. Great decor and atmosphere - cool bar area appears to be an addition on the back of a house that has been converted into seating space for the restaurant. The interior was clean and hip and unexpected based on impression from the outside.  Menu was fairly small and to the point: comprised of starters, \"buns\", dumplings, and ramen. Hubby and I were starving and ordered spicy pulled pork buns to start with. They came out within 3-4 minutes and were very tasty.   We opted to share a large order of dumplings (pork and scallion?) and a bowl of ramen. Dumplings were good - took a long time to come out. Our server had warned us of the delay - about 15 minutes she said. They actually took closer to 25-30. Came out VERY hot (Seriously, be careful!)  and were pretty good. Nothing wrong with them, I just expected them to be... better. We had just had VERY GOOD dumplings at Ha Long Bay the week before, so I may have been biased.   The Tonkotsu Ramen was served in a big bowl - enough for us to share, although a bit awkward to each be slurping noodles out of the bowl in the middle of the table. Great warming and filling broth, pork, bamboo shoots, a soft boiled egg.  We didn't add any \"toppings\" to the ramen, but I was intrigued by the garlic bomb and would probably get that next time.   Overall, we left happy and with full bellies for a decent price. I'll probably return for my very own bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"I'm local to Madison and have tried many restaurants in the area. Umami remains one of my favorite restaurants. The buns are incredible - very soft and filled with tangy spice. The ramen is FRESH and that makes all the difference in terms of taste. Umami's cozy location offers the excitement of dining out as well as the comfort of a home."}
{"text":"This gem was on my list for some time now. Stopped in with my girl on a Tuesday night. (Last night) once we walked in, there was a small line.  However we were seated quite quickly. Still could not believe how packed for a Tuesday night!  I like old houses revamped and zoned for restaurants. Decor was nice and simple. Waiter was very kind and helpful. Beef Bun apps were Freaken amazing!! The Ramen noodles were definitely home made. My mother makes home made for her chicken soup. Ramen Noodles were not as starchy.  In short, the Miso Ramen with added pork was fantastic!!  Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on Saturday night and were surprised to see it wasn't more busy.  It's unassuming from the outside (it's in an old house), but the decor inside is very cool and lounge-y.  We ordered saki-tinis, pork dumplings, and veggie and miso ramen.  Drinks were interesting and fruity without being too sweet--you could definitely take the sake.  Dumplings were delicious and we'd recommend the spicy dipping sauce.  Both our ramen bowls were excellent, not at all too salty (as other reviewers suggested), and I'm pretty sensitive to overly salty foods.  Overall, great value for the price, since the ramen bowls are huge and only $10 each.  Good variety on the menu, and love that they're open late and serving the full menu until midnight on weekends.  Service was very attentive and the server was knowledgable and able to recommend dishes.  (Definitely beats Natt Spill!)"}
{"text":"I was pretty underwhelmed by Umami.   Yes, they serve dumplings. They're no better or worse than dumplings I've eaten at a Chinese restaurant, or even those that I've bought that were made fresh with the sushi at the grocery store. The pork buns were not bad, but again, nothing spectacular. A little overpriced for what you get. Good specialty cocktails but nothing super amazing. Some friends ordered other dishes and everyone was pleased, but not ecstatic.   Been there, done that, probably won't return."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time tonight at Umami during Restaurant Week! We've never been here before, but I hope we'll go again many more times.  I should mention that usually I hate Chinese steamed buns ... mostly because I think the texture is odd, and the ones I've had before were filled with weird tastes that were new, but unappealing. NOT HERE. I was sad I only got to have one bun as part of the Restaurant Week menu, but never fear, there's a food cart right by my job!  I got the spicy tofu bun and loved it. It was not spicy enough/as spicy as I was expecting, but it was still tasty. Then I got the vegan dumplings -- excellent as well, but they kept falling apart. Then, a veggie ramen bowl. It was a perfect summer night, and a little chilly, so the ramen was also perfect. It got pretty heavy and salty for me by the end but I loved all the veggie flavors and noodles. I also love the noodles are made by R.P.'s ! Lastly, I tried the black sesame mochi. No complaints here!  Our waitress was nice, location was great, etc. Thanks Umami!"}
{"text":"I told that chef that if I knew the date of my death, that I would want him to create my last meal. He is a genius."}
{"text":"This past year I have seen ramen restaurants on the travel channel.  I have said to Rhonda, \"Why doesn't Madison have ramen\".  I wasn't looking hard enough.  Umami is here and it is really good.  Restaurants in Chicago, LA and NY should have better food but I am very proud of the restaurant scene in Madison.  Umami doesn't disappoint.  For it's location, parking is plentiful.  The decor is great.  I was a little worried at first about how our service was going to be but it turned out to be great.  We arrived when they opened and all the staff was standing around talking.  Being that they are all young and the restaurant is trendy I thought we would be treated bad but I was wrong.  Our server was funny and the bartender knew her job well.  Rhonda had a mojito and I even liked it.  We had the dumplings.  WOW, I thought I have had some good dumplings in the past but I didn't know.  Umami's were great.  The only bad thing I can say about the ramen is I thought it would have been a little spicier.  Next time we go back I am going to ask about it.  The flavors were delicate and very fresh.  You could taste each ingredient.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal, but the service is laughably bad. It almost seems like a schtick. When I asked the waiter if I could sit with my wife for 10 minutes while she waited for her friend for dinner on a patio with roughly 6 other open tables, I was told doing so is against their \"seating policy.\" I even ordered a drink. Hard to believe a place that has a \"seasonal\" dish that is easily the best thing on the menu and could undoubtedly be offered year round has a policy for anything, but okay.   Don't waste your time. There are too many other good places to eat in Madison without being made to feel like you're unwelcome."}
{"text":"This place is pretty standard for Ramen. I ordered the miso Ramen and I was content with it... I did think it was a bit too much that I had to pay extra for their spice bomb, which is basically a little dish for Sriracha. Their sake was pretty good, the bottles were kind of pricey for not that much in it. Overall the atmosphere was chill and the service was pretty good. I just don't think the food was anything that stuck out to me."}
{"text":"The food was great! The staff was not. nice decor. There is on street parking which is usually available. Downside is it does't open until 4"}
{"text":"I had tried Umami's dumplings and buns at the Willy St fair this summer and they were awesome so I was excited to finally check out the restaurant and try the ramen. I am not a ramen aficionado, but, I really enjoyed what I had at Umami. I ordered their special and unfortunately I don't remember the name but I believe it had a pork (and maybe chicken?) broth base with pork belly, the noodles obviously, some veggies, nori and an egg. The portion was HUGE and I ended up taking about half home with me and it was delicious the next day for lunch. Had I known how much they give you we may have skipped the chicken and mushroom dumplings for an appetizer...but then again, maybe not, as they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious surprise!  Anytime I'm out of town, I search for a hip local restaurant to try out.  After a long search around Yelp, nothing quite grabbed me....just a lot of steak and cheese curds. Luckly I found Umami during a last min Google maps search!  Outside, super cute, looks like you're walking into a house!  Inside, just as cute, very cozy!  There was a wait on a Saturday night of course, but we got a seat at the bar quite quick!  Bartender was amazing, she really knew her stuff and was making awesome drinks in seconds!  Food came out quick too!  I frequent ramen shops, and what really made this stand out from other places was the flavor infused eggs, spicy bomb and garlic bomb.  I freakin' love eggs, these were some of the best ever!  And the broth....I should have worn stretchy pants.  I try not to drink all my broth because I know how high the salt content can get.....not going to happen here.  I made sure every kernel of corn and every bit of scallion made it to my mouth!  The mantou buns were equally amazing!  Some of the fluffiest I have ever had, no wonder they are such a big hit.  I made sure to acquire a t-shirt with the happy pig hanging out in a bun.  Folks back home so jelly...  We wanted to go back the next day, but had to get on the road asap.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried to get a reservation on Friday at 6:30pm for a group of ten. They prefer not to have big groups early but the hostess called me and tried to work it out. We ended up splitting the group up by choice but they were very accommodating. It was very busy but the waitress was very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of.   We always go there for pork buns and ramen and they didn't disappoint. Also love their ginger lychee soda. Must try their dumplings next time."}
{"text":"I saw that this place had Ramen, pork bun, and dumplings and was curious.   There was plenty of dimly lit indoor seating but also outdoor seating facing the street. Watch for the wasps! Parking is available in the back.  Service was great. I was checked on a few times. Drinks and happy hour deals were available.  The pork buns were decent and the bread was not not that thick. It was just enough to cover the ingredients.  I ordered a veggie ramen but I might have been better with the pork-based soup. The noodles were not quite what I expected but for the location, I accept. Perhaps it was the texture of the noodle.  The pork and cabbage dumpling were tasty. They had offered a soy vinegar and  a sweet-and-sour sauce. The skin was thin and held together well.  I wish I had room for the green tea cr√®me br√ªl√©e.   Visa is accepted."}
{"text":"We came to Umami for an earlier dinner, which was nice because it beat the crowd that was to follow. We were able to find street parking (although you may want to just check the lot first) and were quickly seated inside.  Our server for the night was very helpful and attentive, and really answered any questions we had being first timers to Umami. I figured I didn't need my own bowl of ramen, so my boyfriend and I ordered pork buns and dumplings to share, a umami mushroom arugula salad for me, and lastly a big piping hot bowl of ramen for him.   For the food, I have to say that the pork buns were delicious and trumped anything else I tried. If that's the route you want to go, then I may recommend checking out their food cart here in Madison. The dumplings were okay, but didn't stand out as much as the pork buns. My salad was good.  But the real reason people come here is to try the ramen. Overall, I think the ramen was good but was just missing some flavor. We are far from ramen experts and I'd love to try some of the other options on the menu. The bowl was pretty large, so I am glad i went the hodge podge route and ordered a few things to share.  I've heard the brunch menu is amazing, so next time that might be the route we take to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Umami came highly recommended, and the food is fine--but not great by any means.  My problem was really with the service.  Our server took our menus away before we ordered, then came back to take our order (???)  Later, he left our empty plate on the table for a very long time, despite the fact that we were clearly ready to pay the bill and leave...not to mention there was a long wait to be seated.  The real kicker, however, was when I gave him my credit card--which is a Chase Visa card.  It says \"Visa\" on the back side.  He came back and said \"Sorry, we don't take Chase\"...and I told him that it was a Visa card.  Seemingly agitated, he said, \"WE DON'T TAKE CHASE!\"   I gave him another card, he ran the check, and we left...a very modest tip."}
{"text":"The food here is through the roof good. The presentation, the taste, the selection. I have a soft spot for ramen bars and this one does not disappoint. The prices are rather high and I have never left dropping less than $40 on a simple meal, but I was always very satisfied.  I came here for my birthday and Valentine's Day so reservations are a must. This place gets packed even on a weekday so call ahead! I've everything--the lychee mojito, the warmed plum sake, the tonkotsu ramen, the pork belly buns, the mochi ice cream, the potstickers...all out of this world yummy.  Service here is always great and the decor and the cute cocktail glasses are a treat for the eyes.   i think the Pittsburgh equivalent is the Ramen Bar but a quick look at their menu reveals a complete absence of the famed tonkotsu ramen--the best one! So I miss this Madison restaurant a lot, even if I don't miss Madison that much."}
{"text":"If you're expecting Japanese quality ramen then look elsewhere. If you're looking for an alright hot bowl of broth and good noodles and toppings then worth a stop. The dumplings were the biggest disappointment here. Wish I was in Madison longer to try other ramen spots but this wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"After reading my 2 star yelp review, the owner contacted me and offered to comp drink&dessert if I came back.  I came back two months later and the service was very good.  However, the food was still disappointing. The dumplings: I wish they didn't charge for having more than 1 flavor of dipping sauce, and to me, honestly, they didn't taste much better than frozen dumplings and reheating them at home.  The ramen was also disappointing, mostly tasting of salt. I really wanted to like it, but it just wasn't very good.  Desserts were OK--they offered creme brulee or an ice cream sandwich.  The drinks, however, were good, I ordered one of the cocktails they have featured on the menu.  I would go back here for drinks if I was in the area, but nothing else."}
{"text":"We took a chance on this place.  We have been looking for a ramen place since we left Japan.  We spent 3 years in the middle of the heart land...and since then, not been able to find a place that comes close.  This place was close, but not on target.  I will say that the ramen was over priced...very good, but over priced.  This place is more for the small quite bar then their soup.  If you want a unique bar...then this is your place.  if your here for the soup on a cold day...this is not the place.  Service was great by the way."}
{"text":"A fantastic meal for #RestaurantWeek will have me coming back for more! The BBQ Beef buns and and spicy sauce with the dumplings were perfect. It won't matter which dumplings you choose. They are great.  I went wit the Arawe Ramen and it was exquisite. These sent just noodles. They are like manna from heaven."}
{"text":"They ran out of buns the night that we were there. Boo.  The Ramen was ok. They charge you for the hot sauce (don't think it was even house made--maybe just Sriracha?). Really? I mean it should be standard for a bottle of it to be on the table. Their dumplings were SMOTHERED in oil and I am NOT a fan of that.   If we have to be back fine, but trust me I won't be the one to suggest it."}
{"text":"I wasn't really blown away by Umami unfortunately. I thought it was fine...nothing spectacular but certainly edible. I LOVE the outdoor seating and the location but my ramen was actually a bit bland and the chicken in my ramen was beyond tasteless. I will say the broths did have some dimension but it was sort of marred by the bland chicken. The buns were the food highlight for me-I'm a fan of anything with hoisin and the pork in the buns was fantastic!!! Would I go back? Yeah I guess so. Would I be thrilled to be going back? No, not particularly."}
{"text":"Japanese place for breakfast? I was a little skeptical about this place but my wife was really counting on it and we went to this place. I really had the best time ...The bloody mary was out of the world and the steam breakfast buns were really interesting. My wife had mango mimosa which she seemed to enjoy it a lot , but the omu rice she was hoping to taste for a long time was not upto her expectations."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem to have in Madison! Their brunch on the weekends is amazing, and they are the only place in town to serve one of my favorites - Omurice! Absolutely delicious, we will be back and back again just for this dish. Restaurant is small so next time we will definitely make reservations."}
{"text":"We love Willy St & we're looking for a little something with outdoor dining to have a late lunch. Umami looked very charming. Our waitress was so sweet but seemed to forget a few things like water & plates & whether she ordered our ramen or not. But she couldn't have been nicer so it was forgivable.  1st up was the steamed pork buns and the pork dumplings.  The presentation was very nice & the dumplings were really tasty!  I love Chasu Bao and the steamed pork buns were just like it except open.  They were really fresh but had very little taste. It was a bit disappointing.  Then the brunch ramen showed up & bingo!!!  Nirvana!  It made me want to do the Japanese tour on the search for the best ramen noodles in Tokyo.   We shall be back!"}
{"text":"We came to eat and there was a 25 minute wait for a 5 top. The place was half empty but only had tables for two available. We returned 25 minutes later and there was no change so they pushed two tables together for us. Then the hostess realized only 4/5 of our party was there. She then said we'd have to wait for the fifth party to join before seating us. He was two blocks away having drinks with a friend. When they told us there'd be a 25 minute wait we told him to take his time. She did not tell us when we first got there that the whole party would need to be present to be seated."}
{"text":"Overall, an enjoyable dinner in a nice atmosphere.  The variety of dinner offerings are quite vast for a rather small menu. Known for dumplings, buns, and ramen, you might have a hard time deciding on which one to choose; so get one of each! That's what we did and were rather pleased. The buns have a pretty weird texture (they look like raw dough?) but are tasty nonetheless.  Don't let the grandma's house appearance from the outside fool you. Inside is done up quite nice with orange walls and soft lighting.  Oh, and the booze. Although this isn't a place I would come running back for a Friday night out, the lychee saketini was a wonderful compliment to the conglomerate of Asian dishes we ordered. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I personally love Umami! Went the other day and shared the chick and mushroom dumplings, a salad, pork buns and summer rolls. I thought it was all great. You guys should teach some other places how to cook pork belly...  YUMMY"}
{"text":"Every time we dine here we get exceptional food and service.. Even on busy days its well worth our wait! Enjoy"}
{"text":"This gets a full on YAAAASSSSS KWEEEEEEEEN! from me. We started out with the tuna poke and the pork dumplings. The poke was really nice and fresh, and all the flavors melded together so nicely. The wonton chips tasted homemade, and the slaw and the seaweed salad were so good together. The dumplings were your standard pork dumplings. They didn't really stand out for me, but they were good.  The plan was to try multiple items on the menu, but we got hung up on the pork buns. THE PORK BUNS, GANG!!  I actually cashed out my 401K to buy more pork buns. So good. The bun itself has a marvelous texture. Light and fluffy, and a perfect vehicle for the filling. The pork and hoisin combined with the cucumbers and scallions was beautiful. So beautiful that I changed my son's name to Pork Bun the next day. And then brought him here for a pork bun, so he could experience the gloriousness for himself.  I could eat myself sick on these pork buns. And that's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Brunch. Ramen. A house in Wisconsin.  While this sounds like a badly done MadLib, Umami is real, and it is very nice. It made me extremely nostalgic for Portland or Eugene's food scene.   We went here for brunch after a wedding, where in true Wisconsin fashion, the Spotted Cow flowed and the Death's Door poured. So, we were in pain, and the typical brunch sounded awful. No pancakes or Bloody Marys please.  I had the vegetarian breakfast ramen at Umami, and it was great! The only concern I had was that it could have been slightly spicier; but seeing as how it was a miso flavored soup, it makes sense. A new ramen option for brunch with a spicy broth would be great! The waiter was very attentive and kind (probably due to my brunch partner's moans of lager-induced pain) and even gave me an extra egg! The smoked eggs are DELICIOUS, by the way.   Speaking of, my poor partner swore he was too ill to eat anything and just sipped his tea. The waiter kindly recommended the brunch dumplings, which were eaten soundly and enjoyed. Bacon and dumplings, how could one go wrong.   The outside patio, where we sat, was very lovely, underneath trees. We felt like we were at a friend's house. The inside seemed dark though; probably very nice for dinner, but we were happy to be on the porch.   We recommended this place to my brother and SIL in Madison, as SIL is a California transplant and misses her some ramen."}
{"text":"Atmosphere **** Pork Buns **** (but overpriced) Dumplings *** Ramen * (sorry, but it was terrible, horribly overpriced) Drinks & Service ***"}
{"text":"We came here on a busy night. It is a small area for waiting but service was good. The hostess got our drink order pretty fast while we waited. I got the mango mojito which was a little on the sweet side. The wait for a table was very long but we didn't have a problem sitting at the bar which was faster. The bartender took our orders and she was great at explaining the menu. We got the tonkatsu ramen and pork belly buns. The pork belly was way too fatty and I know it is suppose to be fatty but there was barely any meat on it. The buns were nice and soft though. And I've had ramen and pork belly other places and never experienced it that fatty. The broth of the ramen was also insanely salty; and I am an over-salter, I love salt. But even for me it was a little much. Service was really good though. We might come back to try the dumplings but probably not because there are now 2 other ramen places in Madison to give a try and if I want dumplings there are other places to go for just that."}
{"text":"4.5 rating overall!   Service - 4 We went on a Saturday evening 6pm. It was crowded and there was barely any space to stand. We got our seats in like 25-30 mins, the waitress was sweet she handed us the drinks menu while we wait.   Food- 4.5   I loved the pork belly sandwich! Must try it! One won't be enough!! They were scrumptious! I had the pork Raman with garlic shot and spicy shot, I would recommend to order 1 shot between 2 people since the portion is good enough and it's $1 extra for the flavor shots. Raman was really tasty and the pork was very tender and very well spiced.. for dessert we had green tea creme br√ªl√©e , it was absolutely delicious, there was no bitter taste of green tea as I assumed it would have, I would say it was one the best creme br√ªl√©e I have had! Overall this place is great and I will definitely be going there again!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I wasn't too impressed the first time, so I gave it another shot.   I ordered the Tonkatsu with Shiitake Mushrooms. They charge for any extras you have, which is pretty standard of most ramen places, I think. The broth was flavorful, but pretty salty, so I didn't drink the broth after eating the contents of my bowl.  The spicy pulled pork buns are delicious! I find it hard to justify paying that much for two buns, but it was pretty darn good.  I got a Thai Iced Tea. It wasn't too sweet and kind of watered down, to be honest. Hopefully it isn't always like that.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"When you are in Madison, you must stop by this restaurant. I came here 3 days in a row on a recent business trip because the food and drinks were so amazing. Umami is a hip restaurant with an artsy decorated interior. It is a small place converted from a house but, there is plenty of seating at the bar, indoors, or the outside porch area. They have a unique brunch and dinner menu of food and cocktails with an Asian flare and a modern twist. The pork buns are what kept me coming back everyday. The green tea creme br√ªl√©e and white ice saketini are also worth noting. The quality of food here is top notch. The service is also very good and consistent. I highly recommend Umami and it's roaming food truck if you enjoy eating delicious food and decadent drinks. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My first Umami experience was with a great group of fellow Yelpers, which is the perfect way to experience this place as they have a menu conducive to sharing.   While I'm usually not big on the pickled vegetable concept, the seasonal vegetables pickled in sweet rice wine vinegar were admittedly good. They had just the right amount of vinegary saltiness to them and retained their crunch and vibrant color. They were a healthy sort of tasty and visually appetizing.  We also tried the tuna poke, which was a sashimi grade ahi tuna with seaweed salad and apple cucumber slaw with sweet soy and wonton chips. I love appetizers like these and it was indeed good at Umami. A flavorful, yet light way to welcome in the meal.  We of course tried the dumplings and the three sauces: soy vinegar, sweet, and spicy. These were quality. The skin/dough portion was pleasantly thinner than I was expecting and stuffed with much more delicious meat than I had anticipated.   You definitely can't forget the steamed buns. You know they're good when Umami has a food cart dedicated just to these buns. The melt in your mouth pork belly is my personal favorite, but you can't go wrong with any. The bun itself is served warm and is oh so pillowy. And whether its oven roasted house cured pork belly, koren bbq beef, or fried tofu, they don't skimp on the filling.   As my main course, I ordered the Umami mushroom arugula salad with shiitake, baby portabello and button mushrooms, red onions, cucumber, and cherry tomato. I also added smoked tofu and a garlic bomb, which is a puree of roasted and powdered garlic. Yep, it's a few full tablespoons worth of pure garlic nirvana. While the salad was smaller in terms of salads, I left satisfied thanks to the intense flavors of the dish.   Though I'm already convinced of Umami's deliciousness, I need to get back for their namesake ramen, their green tea cr√®me brulee (yes), and what I hear is an excellent brunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I go out for lunch a lot.  We do not live in the city which makes it hard for us to enjoy dinner there.  Umami is only open for dinner.  We happened to be in town a bit later yesterday and went to try them out.  This place has always intrigued us.  Not any more! We each ordered a plate of dumplings.  She had a plate of six vegan and I had nine pork.  We split a summer roll as an appetizer.  We enjoyed our drink and the roll.  It went downhill from there.  About 15 minutes or so after we finished our appetizer, our waiter stops by to tell us that they accidently served one of our entrees to another table and if we could choose another appetizer, on them, to nibble while they recooked our meal.  He served us our free App.  After another 15 min or so after we finished, someone shows with our food.  THey served me the six dumpling plate when I ordered nine.  I mentioned that to the girl and she said she would tell my waiter.  When I was about half done with my plate, the waiter stops be and I mentioned this again to him.  He finally shows up with my other three dumplings about 20 minutes after I finished the original six!   I denied the other three and asked they be removed from the bill so we could get out of there.  A manager never showed his/her face. The intrigue is gone.  We have lived and eaten in the Madison for ten years and have NEVER gotten worst service as we did last night.  No, We will never return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times I thought the ramen was just alright. But I love this place simply for the drinks and the beef and pork buns and dumplings. I could go just to eat appetizers. I do wish the ramen was a little more flavorful, but overall it's a cool place and the inside has a very nice and hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had previously heard great things about this place, so I had some pretty high expectations going in. And, while the restaurant was hip and fun and made me feel cooler than cool just by being there, the food wasn't anything I was about to write home to mama about. :/  I got the vegetarian option and it was fine, but I also think I would've been happier (and richer) if I'd just made some ramen noodles at home. My ramen was also smaller than I thought it'd be for the price ($12) and came out slightly cold (but it also might be that I just like everything to be scorching hot?).  Sooooo overall, the ramen wasn't anything special and I really don't think I will be back anytime soon. It was fine, but your girl is in college and she's too broke to pay $12 for a 15 cent packet.   Btw i am not a ramen expert by any means, so take that as ya will"}
{"text":"Four of us went there.  Edamame appetizer, pork buns, ramen ... everyone enjoyed their meal. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Not sure how anyone could give this place more than 2 stars.  The ramen is definitely not made fresh.  The broth is heavy, the noodles weren't boiled long enough, the braised pork had freezer burn taste and the eggs still had ice in the yolk."}
{"text":"Forgot the mushrooms on my wife's mushroom arugula salad. The rice in my burrito was still hard. Bland. I would not go back. Our waitress, Megan, was nice."}
{"text":"I used to live in Okinawa, and have been trying to find authentic tasting ramen here. Although still not quite the same as japan, this place has the most delicious ramen I've found so far. The ambience is nice, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is great. Try the pork buns, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"MMMMM Umami!   When this place opened, it took me a long time to try it. Not sure why. Maybe the location and parking? Maybe because it's in what appears to be an old single family home converted to a restaurant? Who knows. All I do know is, I should have just gone because when I finally did, I was so impressed.   First visit we sat at the bar for dinner. Our bartender was great. Chatty and attentive but not in your face. We both ordered ramen, different kinds. SO. GOOD. I am pretty picky with ramen. Texture of eggs, ingredients thrown in, the flavoring - it was all perfect. I was really happy with my selection.   My second visit was for brunch. I wasn't sure what the menu would have for brunch as I typically only associate ramen and the like with dinner. We had bacon dumplings, the omurice (rice omelette) and the biscuits and tonkotsu gravy. Everything was really good!   I definitely recommend Umami!"}
{"text":"I'd compare the pork buns to those we had at Momofuku Saam Bar in NYC.  We also like the dumplings but the ramen not so much."}
