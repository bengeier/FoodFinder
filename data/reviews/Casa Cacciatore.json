{"text":"I was traveling in Montreal and wanted to see \"Little Italy\" for some pasta. I don't know French so it was difficult having the menu exclusively in a foreign language. The only downside to the experience was the waiter. He was really rude and said he couldn't help me if I didn't know how to read the menu. I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and had them add shrimp and clams. It was pretty good but the waiter acted very put out the whole time. The bruschetta was delicious! There were bugs in my wine but I just drank it instead of dealing with \"Garson\" some more. All-in-all, I think I would go back here given the chance. It was the best of my dining experiences during this trip (the others were very bad)."}
{"text":"When I want classic Italian, and not some funky reinterpretation of what Italian might be like after an \"in-Fusion\" (can I patent a word?) of something else, this is the place. I don't WANT the decor to change: it evokes old paesano. Never had a bad meal here, and most were stellar. Over the years, had veal (many times), pasta (hard to pass, and I can't think of better than their lasagna), and a few wanderings into other areas (fish, and steak once, but I always feel odd having steak in an Italian restaurant).

Read other reviews. One mentioned an absence of chicken. Might have been a random occurrence (a group ate it all?) but they have two chicken dishes on the menu, and that has not budged in quite a few years.

It IS getting pricier, but they have to live with the times (municipal taxes, power, heating, and the ingredients themselves ever on the rise)."}
{"text":"Great last night in Montreal!  Great find in Little Italy, Casa Cacciatore. Gnocchi light and delicious, well-prepared veal, scrumptious sauces. The dessert crepe with marscapone filling heavenly. Impeccable service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a favorite in our family. Usually, we order in, but when we go to the restaurant, it's even better. Even before the meal, you get a plate of bruschetta. Ours was slightly burned, but they offered us a new one free of charge. The new one was great. The décor gives the place a nice Italian feel. There were many choices on the menu, and we decided on fettuccine with pesto, manicotti, and spaghetti with meat sauce. This was a bit much for a party of one adult and three kids. The pesto was a bit bland, but the spaghetti with meat sauce was really tasty. We even considered buying some of the sauce. The manicotti was great. All in all, an amazing, authentic pasta place."}
{"text":"Amazing. Service was stellar, food was even better. This place doesn't look like much from the outside but trust me -- it is worth it. And great prices too."}
{"text":"This was by far some of the worst Italian food I've ever had. Fettuccine sauce like bad Mac and cheese. Tomato sauce liquidy, runny, and slimy. Also under seasoned, or badly seasoned. Absolutely no finesse or knowledge of Italian cuisine was apparent. There was no chicken on the menu. Veal, seafood, beef. Shabby decor, and the lighted was atrocious. Recessed lights turned up all the way. The service was ok, and the younger man serving us was quite nice and helpful (typically Canadian!) there was an older man serving us, too, who seemed confused, and was hard to understand (I speak French). Very disappointing, since we spent only 3 days in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best authentic italian family restaurant in Montreal. 

This isn't your fancy 6 course kind of italian restaurant, but if you're looking for some great authentic pasta, this is definitely the place. Generous portions, reasonable prices and great services, what more could you ask for? 

Located right outside Jean Talon Metro, this italian jem could easily be missed due to its plain exterior. As soon as you step inside the restaurant, however, is a whole new story. Theres a whole wall dressed up as a wine rack and everyone from customers to waiters are Italian. 

We went with the waiter's recommendations, and ordered the seafood pasta to share (there is over 20 choices of pasta on the menu). They also bring you bruschetta as appetizer to share, and even the bread was nice and toasty. 

The food: BEST PASTA I'VE HAD IN MONTREAL. The clams and mussels were so fresh, and the pasta sauce was superb. Unfortunately, since we've just had pizza right before, we didn't have the room to digest anything else but I can't wait to come back and try more !"}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Best manicotti I've had.  Kid friendly?  VERY questionable.  Maybe for older kids, but not a 4 y/o.  Count on multiple water spills because the glasses are huge and hard for a kid to hold.  The service was good as was the complimentary bruschetta.  The bread was fresh and hot and even the house wine was really tasty.  I'd go again, but only with adults."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem. It features it's own pasta but that's just the beginning. In an effort to save your eyes I will only say GO!!"}
{"text":"What a great find! In the heart of Little Italy the waiter was excellent and helped us out with the French menu. Full bar and the special full course was fabulous. It gave us the opportunity to try the primo pasta with a secundo and dessert. Both pastas- gnocchi and Tagliatelle were great. The gnocchi were served in a white sauce that was delicious. All plates were hot keeping the food at a great temperature. Entrees were great as was the desserts. We ate all of that but did not feel uncomfortable full at the end so just perfect!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My buddy was craving some pasta, so we stopped by Casa Cacciatore to have an old school Italian experience. The interior of the restaurant really gives off that old generation feel, with dark oak walls, old photos, various twentieth century guns, etc.

I ordered their ravioli à la crème. It's quite simply ravioli and a cream sauce. No surprises there. If you're a pasta lover and not shy of the carbs and oodles of cream sauce, you'll find yourself in a happy place with this dish. If you're me, and somewhat concerned about health, you'll want to nibble on maybe half of this then throw in the towel, because boy is that ravioli swimming in cream. 
I also had a chance to try my friend's spaghetti, which was fine.

I'd sum up the pasta at Casa as reliably predictable. You're likely not going to be wowed, but you won't be disappointed if you're a pasta fan."}
{"text":"Best pasta i ever had! 

An italian coworker told me that's the only italian restaurant her family goes to because its so authentic. Therefore, i decided to give it a try since my family loves italian food! 

- service was great and attentive
- The pasta, you can taste the freshness, this is the real deal 
- veal - simply yum!!! 
- we were 8 and all ordered something different, I tasted everything, and all was so good!! i think this is a no-fail restaurant! can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Traditionnel. On est pas ici dans le resto italien branché. On est dans la cuisine traditionnelle bien riche et généreuse. C'est évidemment adapté au public local donc les plats sont servi de façon combiné à la française plutôt qu'en plusieurs service à l'italienne.

La table d'hôte le midi est offerte pour moins de $20 et le service est professionnel et rapide."}
{"text":"Lunched here alone on my last day in Montreal. Great ambiance, great service, and most of all great pasta. I got the tagliolini Alla Gigi - the pasta tasted very fresh and the creamy sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to our must stop place while in Montreal for Grand Prix - Little Italy and Jean Talon Market. I had been checking different Italian restaurants and this was one of them when by chance there they were just outside the market!  Turns out that entrance is kind of the back with a patio. They were repaying the street so what a mess and noise but heh we were up for trying it.  They set up a table for us just being past noon and were very well looked after. I really think they didn't think anyone would be eating that side of the house with all that paving crap. 

We had some good white house wine to start and then they brought out the bruschetta and a similar item that has tomato sauce, cheese, and more sauce; both are very good.  The homemade breads are fresh 

My husband ordered the egg plant appetizer with large tuna salad for the main. I tried both - awesome!  I had asked the waiter to suggest my offering because I couldn't pick one. and he chose the Tagliolini alla Gigi L'amoroso and let me just say that it was freaking amazing.  It is rich and creamy rose type sauce with mushrooms and a hint of cognac. I could not finish it all and actually too left overs to the hotel :). We talked to the waiter as we were paying up, the pasta is made fresh and cooked to order, which explains the bit of a wait but nothing's no more than I wanted as we enjoyed our time and appetizer(s). 

Try this place, it's great, it's simple, and good good Italian food."}
{"text":"Every year my office has a Christmas diner party at a local restaurant. We have been several times to Elunda, La Sirène de la mer and Villa Armando, so this year, they decided to try something new (what a pun there since its a very old restaurant!).

To start, I'm not what you can call a pasta fan; i usually don't eat it out. But, the food was good, although it did not come close to throw me off my chair. I could not get the appetizer I wanted because when they have marinated salmon, they don't have smoked salmon... 

Service was really really good. They (yes, we had several waiters) were attentive to everyone's needs and liking. 

I would try it again for sure."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and attentive. The sauce was perfect. The bathroom needed servicing. But I recommended 4 people to eat there right after I finished eating at the corner!"}
{"text":"Old School Italian.  My daughter and I wanted a good meal in a mellow setting but with a nice standard and Casa Cacciatore fit this exactly.  It's very comfortable, very calm and nicely set up.  It's very traditional Italian decor and food.  The wait staff was attentive and helpful but not overbearing or snooty.  They are equally comfortable in English or French.  Our food was very good and fresh, perfectly cooked, and I had a nice house wine by carafe.  The bill was completely reasonable and we were delighted with our whole experience.  I had the shrimp (crevettes) a al provencale, which was delicious and came with a mushroom risotto side.  My daughter got pasta and loved it.  We ordered a sauteed spinach with garlic as a side (definitely you can share it), and although it is strange maybe to say spinach was outstanding, it was the best version we've had and we ate every bite of it.  Definitely good for families, definitely good for a quiet date, definitely good for a solid, mellow, completely enjoyable meal start to finish."}
{"text":"A friend of mine made reservations to the resto as we were looking for some Italian. Came in through the back door and at first was not impressed. This Casa opened up to a nice little restaurant, full house (expected for a Saturday), clean restrooms and great vibe. Our waiter was very bilingual, friendly and did well for our party of 8. I had some of the best gnocchi that I have ever tasted and the rest of my meal was great. I am sure to return."}
{"text":"Restaurant traditionnel italien, tres bon service, bonne ambiance et terrasse à l'arrière qui donne sur le marché jean-talon. J'y suis allé plusieurs fois et c'était toujours très bon. Les pâtes sont particulièrements bonnes, et pour les viandes ca dépend de vos goûts. J'ai pris de l'entrecôte et du veau je me suis léchée les doigts, par contre ca reste dans le connu, rien de special. Les portions sont énormes, ca vaut la peine de partager. Mon conseil, ne pas y aller sans prendre des pâtes, même si c'est en entrée. Bon restaurant pour accomoder tout le monde, y a beaucoup de choix!"}
{"text":"The food is OK... Much better the next day.. rude servers and takes a long time to get your food. Burnt bread."}
{"text":"Si vous êtes au marché Jean-Talon et qu'un petit creux vous tenaille ou que vous avez une faim de loup, vous êtes au bon endroit!

Que ce soit pour manger une soupe minestrone sur le pouce ou un repas digne d'une mama italienne, tout est bon et classique. J'y ai mangé ce midi et j'ai pris la table d'hôte qui comprend une entrée, le plat principal, café et dessert entre 15,95$ et 19,95$. Tout était bien préparé: la soupe minestrone, le saumon grillé, le café et la salade de fruits frais. Les pâtes sont cuites al dente et le menu offre beaucoup de choix. 

Le midi, la clientèle est plus hétéroclite: des touristes, des clients du marché, les clients du coin. Le soir, c'est plus familial. Les serveurs étaient très gentils, rapides. J'entendais le personnel parler italien. Grazie!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in the entire city,hands down. If I could give them an extra few stars I would.

When I lived in Houston,I used to dream of their divine food. The chef/owner is a genius that serves up food porn on white plates. It's conveniently located right by Jean Talon market. 

It's busy on the week-ends so make a reservation or go after 20:00. Group reservations are accepted with forewarning. Full bar is available,the limoncello is potent.

The first time,we went was approximately 10 years ago. It was near closing time and the entire staff were seated at a large table watching the hockey game on a 90's TV,I knew right then that this was the beginning of something special. 

The name of the restaurants translates to the house of the hunter. It has an old school vibe to it that makes you feel right at home with white linen table cloths & napkins. They have an entire wall dedicated to wine bottles. Intimate & romantic,it's great for anything from a first date or a family/friend get together.

Once you become a regular,the staff remembers you every time,it's a nice touch in today's world. Most of them have been working there for well over 15 years which is a good testament to how the place is managed.

The menu is cooked fresh in house including all the pasta with the only exception being the bread which they buy at a bakery down the road.
As soon as you sit,they bring complimentary bruschetta & marinara/cheese crostini (one of each per person) & warm bread with butter. The house wine is surprisingly delicious as well.

The menu is quite extensive & a table d'hote is offered as well. Antipasti,eggplant parmesan (my favourite) & other appetizers are available. Veal,chicken,quail,beef,fish & pastas are offered as mains. My spouse's favourite is the gnocchi with rose sauce. I swear they are the best anywhere,little potato pillows that melt in your mouth. They aren't on the menu but they are available. Same goes for the cheese filled manicottis. The marinara is delicious not too sweet or acidic with a great consistency.

Over the years,I've fallen in love with the linguini al pesto genovese. The balance of flavour & creaminess are mind blowing. Should you find yourself unable to choose between 2 pastas get the pasta duo & for a few extra dollars you can get both. Treat yo' self people! 

The chicken parmesan is phenomenal in all it's crispy glory,moist & well sauced,just the way it should be. It usually comes with potatoes & vegetables but you can get pasta for a few extra dollars. The chef chooses the pasta for you if there's something you don't like let them know. I generally always end up taking left overs home & they reheat very well. 

The dessert are good but by the time I've eaten the appetizer & main entree,I'm usually full at that point.

Finally for the gluten free peeps,you can bring your own GF pasta,choose your sauce & they will be happy to cook it for you.

It's one of my happy places."}
{"text":"In the end I was disappointed but overall the meal was A-OK. Service was fast, friendly and authentic, and the menu was varied and had virtually every Italian food. All my family members ordered straciatella soup which was admittedly good when I tasted it. I think I may have just ordered the wrong thing...I ordered veal with the name \"Cacciatore\" which I assumed would be a cream sauce with mushrooms but was very very buttery and way too rich. The meat quality wasn't especially good either. All portion sizes are large. I'd consider going back and re-evaluating. They have an outside eating area."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place that served fresh authentic pasta. I came across Casa Cacciatore, I had read good reviews, so I decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised. They started out with a plate of bruschetta, followed by a basket of warm bread.

As for the food If you like Italian, the menu covers everything. I ordered a small plate of tagliatelle Gigi and veal parmesan as the main course. It hit the right spot, i mean I have had a lot of Italian food but this was the most authentic i have ever tasted. I still can't get over that sauce, WOW!!! I am already thinking about going back. The staff is very friendly and they know the menu very well. Even their house wine was good. You can't go wrong, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food, very nicely prepared , generous portions. We had complementary bruschetta  . My sea food linguini was loaded  , pasta al dente . Service is impeccable. The chef came to welcome us and ask us about the food. Everybody enjoyed the meals . The restaurent is old style not a hipster place but rather have the feel of authenticity. I definitely recommend the place . Next time we will try the mussels it looks appetizing on the table next to us . Oh yes and the house wine is good and at a good price, complemented well our food."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, but nothing exceptional. Decor is interesting, location is excellent, and the service was good. Not a particularly memorable dining experience"}
{"text":"I'm staying in Montreal for another week, and have easily decided to have dinner here every day. I had the Bufala salad which was among the best I've had. The mozzarella wasn't just a slice, but it was actually crumbling a bit when handled. Lovely with a fresh, grainy texture. They don't have Burrata but their Bufala compensated for that. Then I had the Seafood Pasta which was delicious, cooked just right, and very fulling. Their Tiramisu was ok. Order came fast and hot. I ended up paying quite the sum, but then again I had a 3-course meal."}
