{"text":"Fresh fish! Loved it! I got an order of fish and chips. Great taste, not fishy and a great portion for the price. I would have to say it's the best fish and chips I've had in Calgary. Their food is so good they were out of a couple of things I wanted to try so I will definitely be back. Tried the donair sauce and dipped my fries in it. Really good sauce, can't wait to try it on the donair pizza! The guys here are great! Little place off 52nd ave. Parking lot is small but there is street parking. One picnic bench outside, but it is a take out place, so don't expect to go in and sit down. Enjoyed my food in my car and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Scotian Style, as the best place to get awesome donairs. I have to say we were not disappointed.   There was a little bit of wait for the food. Since they were busy with takeout orders. But it was only 15 minutes. Not bad of a wait for good food.  I was indecisive as to what to get. Torn between a lobster roll and a donair. So I got both! The lobster roll was AH-MAZING! All lobster and no other fillers. The donair with Bros Pepperoni and that donair sauce was drool worthy. The sauce lingers on your tongue for a bit and it makes you want to take more bites of the donair.  My husband who is from Vancouver and happens to be quite biased when it comes to donair (he's got his fave spot in YVR for the best donair)... devoured the donair platter... which was large enough to feed 2 people... enjoyed every single bite of the east coast style dish. When I say biased... he hasn't liked any donair place here in YYC until now.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish n chips, hubby had the donair and we shared garlic fingers. The fish n chips was perfect, light batter, crisp, not greasy and the fish was fresh and flaky. I'm often disappointed by fish n chips because its overcooked, has too much batter, too much grease, etc... This place really knows how to do their fish right!  They also have the choice of haddock or cod. The garlic fingers had a nice fluffy fresh dough, and were very good. Hubby seemed to really enjoy the donair. The staff was very friendly & we would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal if you're looking for authentic Halifax donair and pizza. It's a great fix when I'm homesick! The team is super friendly. I only wish it was located in the SW but it is worth the drive to the NE."}
{"text":"The whole clams and chips were very good. The service was prompt and friendly. Will visit many more times to come to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"Being a Bluenoser myself I was excited for my first visit. Sorry peeps but really disappointed. We had donair and clam strips. Sweet sauce on donair was weak. Clam strips were okay.   I'll try again when the dulse is in."}
{"text":"At the Yelp! Elite Cactus Club event a bunch of us were recommending favorite places and hidden gems - one that stood out to me was Scotian Style Take Out recommended by Stephanie M. The reason why it stood out to me is because I work with a bunch of guys from out East and they've been talking about Halifax donairs, garlic fingers and this 'donair sauce' - Scotian Style Take Out happen to be in the NE, in the same quadrant where I work, so it was perfect.   The next morning, I was excited to tell the guys about this place. That afternoon, they decided to check this place out and of course I tagged along. Scotian Style is located on 52nd Street NE in a little complex between convenient and liquor store. There are some designated parking spots out front. The menu is extensive, they offer donairs, subs, pizza, garlic fingers, donair eggrolls, a variety of seafood options (deep fried), platters, fries, poutine, burgers, wings and salads. It's a small take out place where you can pretty much watch them make your food. They also have some frozen items, chips, pop that you can grab and go as well.  The guys ordered large donairs with the works (onion, tomato, donair sauce), an order of garlic fingers, 6 donair eggrolls. We bought it back to the office to eat, alternatively, there's a dodgy looking picnic bench in front of the parking lot on the grass if that tickles your fancy.   The guys were super curious but excited to see if the food compared to the food out East. The donairs were double wrapped in tin foil, we soon discovered it was double wrapped to keep the donair sauce in! S took a first bite and was noticeably pleased \"daaaaamn that's good\" he says. I tried a bite and the meat was juicy and tender, the donair sauce was a very nice and sweet addition. Next, the donair eggrolls - exactly as written, donair meat wrapped in wonton wrappers, comes with a side of donair sauce for dipping. These were unique, they were nice, tasty and crispy...the donair sauce is a must! Eggrolls are a must try. The garlic fingers are a pizza dough topped with cheese and garlic seasoning, these were pleasant, nice and soft with that crisp you hear when you take a bite, donair sauce to dip is a must for these too. Per the easterners, the crust should be a little thinner but it was pretty close. Also, they mentioned that the sauce is really good but it should be a bit thicker. I was thinking after refrigerating the sauce for a couple hours, it would be the right consistency. Overall, they were pretty satisfied and they said that the Scotian Style Take Out is really good and pretty close to what they serve back at home - they're fans and will be back!"}
{"text":"I finally had to try this place out after hearing about it from friends.  I have to say I'm not dissapointed, the food is a very welcome taste of back home for me.   I've lived in Alberta since 97 when I moved from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia so I'm super happy to have found a place to enjoy some back home comfort food. I have to say my favorite are the donair egg rolls, they are to die for!!  The donair sauce is heaven and just like back home.  I had the whole clams and they where tasty, I plan on trying the PEI bar clams next but I do have to so you just can't beat clams and chips from back home, just something about them being super fresh. I've yet to try out the donair, donair pizza or any other pizza but I'm sure I will be back for more. I also have to add that they brought in some favorite pops from back home recently and I'm so happy to finally have some Sussex Golden Ginger Ale to enjoy here.   Check it out, great food and even friendlier staff!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the East coast, but going into Scotian Style makes me feel like I've been close. They're a humble little kitchen with some eclectic East coast decorations scattered around. I simply had to go whilst in Calgary because a family friend who has spent considerable time living in the East recommended it as the BEST donairs in the city.  We stopped in around 5:30 and although we were able to walk in and order right away, there were deliveries and phone orders ahead of us, so we ended up waiting around 35 minutes until our order was ready. There are only a few guys working in the kitchen so the speed is definitely understandable, but I would phone ahead with your order because, well, why wait!  We got Scotian Style Super donairs, which are made with beef, onions, tomatoes, SUPER good pepperoni, and their delicious donair sauce (of course). In addition to that, we ordered a dozen of their donair egg rolls, which BLEW MY MIND. They fold up a bunch of the beef that they put in their donairs and fry it in egg, then give you the donair sauce to dip it in. Oh my WORD, my arteries were extreeeemely mad at me, but the happiness my taste buds got was absolutely worth it. To wash it all down, we got a few cans of Sussex Ginger Ale, which I had never had before and although they were super good, my Western taste buds actually prefer Canada Dry (yeaaah I know, sue me!). I should also note: I can eat quite a lot and I was JUST unable to finish a large Super donair, with some egg rolls and a bit to drink as well, so trust me, you will most certainly be full off of that amount of food!  I would love to give them 5 stars, but I actually noticed a little bit of a hygiene concern when I was inside waiting. The employees work without gloves, which wouldn't be a big deal but I also didn't see them wash their hands the entire time I was inside. Maybe I missed it but I feel like it should probably be done often enough that I would notice it, for being inside that long, you know? BUT, as this fix is easy enough and I can't say whether or not it was just an off day, Scotian Style will sit pretty at 4 stars! :)"}
{"text":"The first time we ate here it was awesome. We stopped in just to check it out.  I really enjoy the lobster roll and fries we got.  the price was decent and we didn't wait that long for it. We liked it so much we wanted to show my inlaws it, since its not too far from their house. We got delivery. Big mistake, it took a long time and we found out after they forgot our fries. They did come back but by that time was cold. We had one of the pizzas and all felt very off the next day."}
