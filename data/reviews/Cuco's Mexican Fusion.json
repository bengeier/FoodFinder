{"text":"Big turnaround! The food was fantastic, service excellent, and price was affordable. Glad they switched to an authentic menu. Really delicious, atmosphere was very quaint"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously over priced. A small order of chips and salsa is $6 and if you want guacamole with it is $6 more! Definitely don't waste your time and especially your money on this place."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to and overpriced to boot.  Worst guacamole I've ever had unless you like just mashed up avocado.  Nachos were a joke!  12 chips drizzled with what tasted like creme of mushroom soup from a can.  The service was slow and incompetent and the restaurant was about 1/4 full.  The bathrooms were about 90degrees and twice Mexican music popped on for about 20 seconds at full volume.   My drink was wrong and I was never offered another because the server just never showed up.  I did like the decor and layout..  Hopefully a restaurant worthy of the space will move in soon,"}
{"text":"We tried Cuco's Mexican \"Fusion\" on one of the first days. That's always dicey from a service standpoint. First off, this is not a fusion restaurant. Fusion, by definition, means that you are fusing two or more cuisines into something unique. That's not what's going on here. They have \"upscale\" Mexican fare and a separate sushi bar (two different and totally unrelated and unfused cuisines). This combination is nothing short of absurd and in my opinion. The only apparent reason that there is a sushi bar in this place is because it's in the space of the former Muramoto (which is now just up the same street a half a block) and so the equipment was there. 

We did not try the sushi. I'm not sure why someone would come here for sushi when the master of that genre, Muramoto, is just steps away. We ordered the guacamole \"tableside.\" It was not prepared table side as promised in the menu but rather came in an uninspired scoop on a plate with too few chips to eat it. We also tried one of their soups. We had no silverware so had to ask the waitress for spoons. She brought us two iced tea spoons. The guac was very average and the salsa was run of the mill. We couldn't get a server's attention to see if there were other salsa options. 

We then tried the seafood stuffed poblano pepper as a main. This dish showed promise. It had a tasty sauce and nice, large pieces of lobster in it. The ratio of rice to sauce was off (too much rice) but overall, a pretty nice dish. Here's the thing though, this was a $30 dish. At that price you are competing with Madison's finest restaurants - and you are no where near that league. 

My suggestions:
-- Get rid of the sushi. It's absurd.
-- Get a real sign out in front and take down the cheap beer advertisements in the windows. If indeed you're shooting for an upscale experience with prices to match, provide the whole experience and be careful of things like that that make the place look like just another average Mexican restaurant. 
-- Hone the upscale Mexican dishes both in flavor and presentation - make them live up to the price and promise of \"upscale.\"
-- Train your staff. If indeed you want to serve $30 entrees, you need to provide a fine dining experience. The service was nothing short of terrible. Our waitress presented us with the bill before we had finished the entree! She could have offered dessert, coffee, additional cocktails, etc. That's not only good service, it's good business for you. 

Absent a significant shift, I don't think this place will be around long. I'd love to see and experience a truly upscale Mexican restaurant, but the effort here is half-baked at best."}
{"text":"Three point five with potential so I'm rounding up to a four. 

So far I've only been in for drinks, and they were delicious but pricey. This iteration of Cuco's is going for a more upscale experience focusing on sushi, seafood, and hand-crafted cocktails instead of tacos and frozen margs (though they do have both of those things). 

On a super stormy Wednesday night we stopped in and headed to the bar. I decided to bring some sunshine into my day with the Cocochata and my boyfriend ordered the Mai Tai. The bartender, Ivan, was super great about answering our questions and made sure I liked creamy drinks before constructing mine, letting me know he could sub in Malibu for the coconut flavor to thin it out. I personally loved the blend of Rumchata, Cruzan coconut, and pineapple juice and am looking forward to enjoying it again on their patio on a warmer day. 

The Mai Tai my boyfriend ordered was tasty but very sweet - they use a good amount of grenadine. I have a major sweet tooth so it didn't bother me, but I think many people may want to ask them to go light on the syrup. 

When we finished our drinks Ivan surprised us with a house margarita to try. It's made to order and is seriously boozy, but it's quite tasty. They've been offering a lot of 2-for-1 deals on their margaritas and that's definitely worth it if you are a tequila fan. The marg itself tasted salty but I couldn't tell if it was incorporated into the liquid or if a bunch of salt had just slid off the rim into the glass. By the end I was struggling with the saltiness, but I order my margs with no salt so I don't anticipate a problem in the future. 

While I enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks, I can't afford to be a regular. Our two drinks with tax and tip came out to $26, and I threw down another couple of dollars on our way out for the surprise margarita since it was such a nice gesture. Most dinner items are in the $20 range (fusion rolls are mostly $20-25 per roll), and for my tastes it just doesn't appeal to me enough to have a $100 dinner. 

They do takeout and the lunch chimichanga sounds reasonable at $10 for chicken tinga or barbacoa. Looking forward to it and looking forward to seeing what specials they come up with. The staff seems passionate and I hope they have success! I'll just have to keep an eye out for specials."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner there this evening. Chips and salsa were perfect and my partner and I each got some fajitas and enjoyed them. Service was fantastic and will definitely be back for some more Mexican fare. One of the better Mexican restaurants I've been to in Madison."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great service, great food! Love the interior design! Workers are all so friendly! And tacos were spicy and delicious! Will definitely be back :)"}
