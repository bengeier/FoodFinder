{"text":"Wow let me explain from the bottom up this place was amazing. We had a wonderful server, great food and a lovely atmosphere. The deserts are to die for. The steak melted in your mouth and the pickles & bacon, big time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It was my husband's birthday and he loves steak and apparently Gibbs's is an institution. The atmosphere was something from the 70's, and seemed dingy and dark. While the portions were large, nothing was very tasty. It all seemed like something from a 80's era Sizzler.  My kabob's were cooked to my request but lacked flavor. The Gibby's salad was just a standard salad with a basic dressing, not sure why everyone raves about it. They did provide a huge amount of pickles at beginning of the meal, which my husband appreciated. They also provide a palate cleanser of lemon sorbet (too sweet) between servings.  The recommended wine was barely palatable. Our waitress was kind but she had so many tables to attend to, we hardly saw her. For more than 250 CAD$ I expected delicious and just got ho hum."}
{"text":"First night in Montreal and we were spoiled for the rest of our meals!  
Service was top notch - they had our table reserved and waiting for us even though we were 20 minutes early and they were pretty full.  Waiter seemed to be always around when we needed him for refills, etc...but never really noticed him hovering.
Started off with the Escargot and the Shrimp Bisque - both excellent!  They even brought bread, butter, a jar of pickles and a bowl of fresh bacon bits (really????, however we used them up in our salad and entree sides!).
We ordered the 22oz bone in Ribeye (Medium) and the 10oz Filet (Medium Rare) - both were cooked perfectly.  The Monte Carlo Potato was like a twice stuffed but with extra onions!!!!!
Our waiter made our Martini table side (nice touch) and the wine list had a lot of good selections.
Overall, great experience - staff was really top notch and the food was perfectly prepared!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Gibby's for over 35 years. Even after we moved out of Montreal when I was 6 (I'm 24 now), we continued to make Gibby's our go-to celebration spot. I'm obsessed with Gibby's birthday cakes and with every trip to Gibby's to this day, my family tries to trick me into thinking they stopped doing the cakes. 

When you're seated, they bring over their amazing homemade bread along with my favorite pickles and a bowl of cottage cheese with chives. I could make a meal out of those 3 items alone, but then I'd be missing out on the whole Gibby's experience. 

French onion soup is exactly what it should be- rich broth, sweet onions and lots of golden cheese. Fantastic. 

The salad dressing is some of the best garlic dressing I have ever had. It's so garlicy that they bring you a citrus sorbet (as a child I was really excited about ice cream in the middle of dinner!) to cleanse your palette before they bring out the entrees. 

Steaks are consistently great cuts of meat cooked perfectly. The monte carlo potato it comes with is a nice change from the usual steakhouse potatoes. We mostly order filet in my family, but ribeye and rack of lamb are also great. 

Every trip to Montreal includes at least one visit to Gibby's, sometimes more and I would never have it any other way"}
{"text":"The steak is good but everything else from the sides to the desert and service were sub par. Not worth the money or meal in a city with food like Montreal"}
{"text":"Normally I like to talk about the food first, which is top notch here. But I must say that my favorite thing on the menu here is a dessert, item. First of all they make their own ice cream here which is one of the best I have ever had. Do yourself a favor and order the crepe jubilee. Homemade cherry sauce with vanilla ice cream rolled crepe. This is the best dessert I have had.

Then not to forget the beef wellington is great here. Just remember they give you big portion size so remember to leave room for dessert.

Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Determined to try all the different steakhouses Montreal has to offer, Gibby's was next on the docket. 

Arriving at around 6 on a Friday night, we were seated immediately. We ordered the clam chowder, the crab cakes, the mustard encrusted steak and scampi on the side. 

We started the meal off with complimentary bread and pickles. Pickles get me every time. Then came the surprise of the night- lemon granita to cleanse the palate! Unexpected, but most welcome. The clam chowder was very good and hearty, plenty of seafood and potatoes. Definitely made my insides smile. The crab cakes on the other hand were a let-down. For 17$, you get 2 small crab cakes with a red chili aioli. The crab cakes tasted like burnt breadcrumbs more than anything. Definitely made my insides sad.

I'm not much of a red meat eater, but according to my boyfriend the steak was good, perfectly cooked to his medium-rare-liking. The steak came with a \"Gibby's salad\" and a Monte Cristo potato.

The service was impeccable- our server Cynthia was fun and attentive. All in all, I would go back to Gibby's but only for special occasions."}
{"text":"Despite coming on a busy night during Labor Day weekend, we were seated after about a half hour. Large portions. You definitely won't leave hungry. Attentive service, hard working staff. The food was very good, however our steak was cooked a bit under from what was requested. Garlic shrimp and crab cake were absolutely amazing. I wish that there was a more extensive drink menu though. They offer mostly wine. When I asked for a gin martini, I was given gin and St. Germaine in one glass and then a separate glass with grapefruit juice. My boyfriend had a similar \"2 cup drink\" situation as well for his drink request."}
{"text":"Looking for great food & atmosphere, look no further!!
Situated in Olde Montreal, the decor of Gibbys is wonderful. An olde stone building with lots of history, reminiscent of an olde tavern. The atmosphere is warm w/ a sense of luxury.
We came for 6:00, promptly seated by friendly waitstaff.
Bread, butter, pickles...... & bacon bits served with every meal. Very tasty.
The french onion soup was very good, if I had to nit pick....too much cheese.
Salads were very fresh, crisp lettuce, onions & very nice house vinaigrette dressing. 
In between courses a seldom seen citrus Sorbet, an old classic!
We opted for the smaller rib steak, even the small was at least 16 oz. The Gibbys cut would have been far too much beef.
The steaks were cooked perfect with just enough seasoning not to overpower the flavour.

We recommend Gibbys steak house for great food, atmosphere & dining experience.

Please be aware Gibbys is not a cheap steakhouse, it is worth the visit. A table for 2 could easily spend $250."}
{"text":"Under-seasoned + overpriced = underwhelmed. I've enjoyed my share of excellent steaks at top-notch steakhouses in NYC, Chicago, and other major cities. Dry-aged, prime beef well-seasoned and cooked to perfection...perhaps my expectations were too high for Gibby's, but my wife and I were not impressed with the experience. 

We were seated promptly for our 7:30 reservation on a Thursday evening, given menus, then ignored for 15 minutes. Seriously?  It isn't like they were packed tonight. After finally placing our orders, they brought out a bowl of good garlic pickles, small loaf of bread (nothing special), and 1/2 a stick of butter plopped onto a small searing dish. 

Wife had the gazpacho & I had the Gibby salad, although the anchovies I requested were not to be found; otherwise, both were serviceable if nothing special. 

For dinner, I had the Gibby's rib steak. Totally lacking in salt, pretty clearly not dry-aged - I do better with Costco rib eyes on the grill @ home. Decent ambiance, but no way was it worth the $145 for two entrees + two glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Steak!  Double baked potato, pickles and a loaf of bread.  Not cheap, but it was a great meal."}
{"text":"The service is always fantastic, the ambiance is great.  Started with oysters Rockefeller which were some of the best id ever had. Had the wellington which was cooked to perfection (medium rare). They could give Ramsey a run for his money.  The Monte Carlo potato never disappoints and is well worth all the carbs. If your looking for a place to go look no farther!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening. I thought the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the smoked salmon and my boyfriend had the NY steak. I felt like the salmon was over-smoked. I wanted the Monte Carlo potato, and asked to have no bacon added in (I don't eat meat), but the server said the potatoes were already pre-cooked. Kinda sucked. The bread roll was very good, sweet and served alongside with bacon bits, and pickles. They also have an extensive wine menu. It was a busy night when we went- the restaurant was packed, so staff wasn't as attentive to our table. Yummy chocolates at the end of the meal. Overall, we felt the food was fine, but overpriced."}
{"text":"If this is a steakhouse, I am a walrus. Never in recent memory have I ever left more than half of my steak on the plate. I'm not sure what has to be done to remove all taste from a rib-eye but behold this establishment has achieved it! 

If you're a fan of pickles, they come complimentary. If you detest the sight of them, no one will warn you and they will come complimentary anyway."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome!! Excellent service, the waitress was extremely friendly and even helped me choose my steak entree. It was absolutely delicious!! Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The ambience is also to be mentioned. The wood beams and exposed brick give this place a cozy feel. They provide sorbet to cleanse your pallet and their homemade mint chocolate at the end of the meal is a wonderful treat! I highly recommend this establishment. Order the ribeye!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the good ratings and recommendations for this place.  For the price I would have expected better service. Save your money for a steak somewhere else (and cheaper, even in Old Montreal!) The only thing I see worth while was the pickles.

1) Too touristy (which is to be expected, but be aware this did not seem to be a 'local' hangout)
2) Service was slow
3) $50 beef wellington - puff pastry was thick and soggy inside yet burnt on the outside (my wife has even cooked it better at home before!) In addition, the filet tasted like medium pot roast even though I ordered medium rare.
4) Waitress took back beef wellington and said that she didn't charge for it, but when the check came, she still charged me for a \"salad' for the sides that came with the meal.
5) My wife's rib-eye steak was extremely fatty and lacking flavor
6) Wine was no better that Trader Joe's 3 buck chuck... anyone who knows trader joes knows that their wine is amazing for that price. (Ordered Hardy's 2009 Shiraz/Cab-Sav blend for $32)

Overall the service was bad and the quality of the food was worse that what I can get at the supermarket and make for myself."}
{"text":"it's for American tourists. Not much local individual will show up here. Food is in HUGE portion and had long lost its French spirit."}
{"text":"C'est peut-être mon steakhouse préféré. Le buf wellington est délicieux! Le service est impeccable et efficace."}
{"text":"Steak et fruits de mers... A1"}
{"text":"This restaurant is outstanding.  The food is terrific!!!  The atmosphere is warm and comfortable. It is beautiful.  The service was great! My husband had rib eye and I had a Cajun rib eye.  They were the very best.  The Cajun was really spicy. The twice baked potatoes were very good.

We highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait until our next trip to Montreal to go again."}
{"text":"during our stay in montreal we were lucky enough to get a reservation to dine at this wonderful restaurant  the food was hot, plentiful, beautifully prepared, staff was able to answer all questons, valet service, beautiful atmosphere great wine selection
the bisque soup was the best i every had, loved the bread and pickles  sit downstairs for a quiet diner  diner is expensive but worth it  the restaurant is in a beautiful old building    we had steak and fish and both were delicious"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I have been here with family, customers and other people from work.  The steaks are amazing.  The Beef Wellington is probably my favorite.  This is a pricy restaurant but it is worth it!  Go with a few friends, take your time, relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse in Montreal. Amin, our server, was a true professional and gentleman (he cut my daughters steak for her without hesitation). The atmosphere is traditional and the service is professional yet warm. The food, oh the food, still thinking about days later. It's not cheap, but neither are you! So enjoy and spend some time and money on yourself!"}
{"text":"Gibbys has a great atmosphere!  We had a very attentive waiter who knew exactly when to come over. They gave very tasty pickles along with a great loaf of bread while you wait for dinner. The Monte Carlo potato side is to die for! I could have had that for dinner alone! Well worth the dining experience!"}
{"text":"Lovely and romantic environment, server was very nice. We order steaks. That was very very good. You must try it if you come Montreal"}
{"text":"I stopped by Gibby's on my last trip to Montreal and it was one of the best steakhouse dinners I've ever had and for a high-end steakhouse it has absolutely fabulous prices.

The atmosphere is typical old school steakhouse, dark, earth tones, a manly feel.

After taking your drink order the waiter will bring out a bowl of pickles, big pickles. They're on the saltier side but damn good tasting. The waiter also brings out a bowl of grated Parmesan (I believe) cheese, which left me confused at first as it's obviously not meant for pickles.

My drink, a Bombay Sapphire and tonic came out in 2 separate glasses, one with ice and gin in it and another with the tonic water, you mix it yourself from there, which I quite enjoyed.

For an appetizer I had escargot, they came out boiling hot in a wonderful Bourguignonne sauce. Which after eating the tasty little snails I sopped up with the excellent bread they give you.

Your main course is served with a choice of soup, their house salad or some sort of vegetable dish. I chose their house salad, the Gibby's salad. For the life of me I can't remember the dressing it came with but this where the Parmesan comes into play, it goes great with the salad and I do remember that I ate every last piece of it.

For my entree I had the Gibby's cut rib steak, medium-rare of course, with an au poivre sauce because. It came with steamed asparagus (my favorite vegetable with steak) which was cooked perfectly and the best potato I've ever had in my life, they call it the Monte Carlo, it's double baked and has bacon, sour cream and chives in it. It's a little piece of starchy crack. I could have eaten 10 of them no problem but alas I had a beautiful steak to take care of. Speaking of the steak, it was cooked to perfection and amazingly tender and flavorful, same with the au poivre sauce, just perfect. One of the top 5 steaks I've had in my life.

With dinner I originally wanted a glass of Beaujolais-Villages because I'm a fan of very light red wines. The waiter, a prefect representation of a steakhouse waiter (and I mean that in the best possible way) did not agree with my selection and instead advised me to try the Pinot Noir, he was right, it went great with my steak.

And because I intended to gorge myself I got the creme brulee for desert along with a B&B, like the rest of the meal, it was great.

On a side note, the menu at Gibby's is in English however our waiter was definitely a Francophone, there wasn't any problem with ordering though. The portable credit card machine was in French however and because my French is incredibly limited I had to ask for assistance with it."}
{"text":"Gibby's

In an ancient stone convent
Once a hospital 
By the river
Where French is music
To my ears
The beams of wood know stories 
I would like to hear
Of anniversaries and parties
Love affairs 
Fond memories of friends
Waitress almost too tall for the low ceilings
Waiters accommodating and prompt
A family with a beautiful baby
Her older brother carries a toy guitar
A mother who gazes at her son
She is laughing because 
His story, so funny 
Is true"}
{"text":"Went there after several years, nothing really has changed. The location is still the prime draw. Menu had a few off the wall mains including shrimp curry with mango chutney, which really is a bit out of place given the average price of mains is $40+.  Server seemed already overwhelmed while the crowd had just begun to file in, and forgot the drinks of two people out of a party of six at the table. Steaks are still the best bet, my filet mignon was perfectly cooked med-rare, but was not as juicy as you would expect for $50 hunk of meat. Monte Carlo potato is overrated, and so is the famous Gibby's salad. Bottom line: if you are looking for overpriced but undersized portions with an underwhelming service in a picture perfect setting, Gibby's is the place to go."}
{"text":"Don't let yelp steer you wrong like it did me.  Was in town and needed a restaurant in a pinch. Found this on Yelp and disappointed doesn't say enough.  Shocking that this restaurant has received so many favorable reviews.  The food was greasy, tasteless, old fashioned, and of low quality.  Not one of the dishes ordered for the table was acceptable.  Both salads were filled with yellow iceberg lettuce.  The shrimp appetizer was surprisingly cooked well but swimming in butter. Beef Wellington was greasy, unseasoned, and extremely over cooked. It is served with a gravy that is most definitely poured right out of jar. Lobster tails were cooked reasonably well but totally unseasoned and tasteless. Lobster tails themselves had no flavor (I'd guess that they are frozen and not fresh). Accompanying the dinners were sides of white rice (Gibby's refers to white rice as Rice Pilaf) and over cooked asparagus.  I suspect the kitchen is run in a similar fashion to a cafeteria rather than a fresh cooking restaurant. 

In a city with so many wonderful restaurants I have no idea how this place still exists.  On top of the terrible food the service was also poor. Our waitress seemed as if she did not know what to do with children at her table and came off as quite rude.  She came by no less than 4 times to \"remind\" my 4 yr. old to sit down.  As with any child he cannot sit for extended periods of time. He stood in place (holding a conversation not even eating) and this seemed to bother our server immensely. I didn't really think about her constant reminders until a guest at the table behind us leaned in to share that she thought our server was being extremely rude with her \"constant hounding of our son\".  Regardless, I do not let bad service ruin the night. I am a former chef and when I go out to eat I am there to eat. The food ruined the experience.  This sadly was one of the worst meals I've had out in a while.    

The only positive is the building. Very cool old stone building with exposed wood beams. It is too bad this location is wasted on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was great! Had the Rib eye steak tender, juicy, succulent one of the best I've ever had! Would definitely go back if I ever visit Montreal again!!"}
{"text":"CAN'T HANDLE STRESS!  Ordered Filet, cooked medium, came well done and very charred!  Then asked to get Beef Wellington, cooked medium, came rare.  Contacted management, and while apologetic, explained that it was a busy night for them.   Far from world class!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday. It was recommended by our tour guide so we thought to check it out. It's located in old Montreal. We drove to the restaurant and good thing they had valet because it was hard to find street parking. We made reservations on a Wednesday night. The restaurant is huge! 2 floors. Brick walls, dark lighting. It was pretty loud in the place with it being so big. 

We ordered steak and the osso bucco. The steak was cooked perfect at medium rare. Delicious. We chose to have the salad which was average. They give you bread and bacon bits. In between your meal they give you lemon sorbet to cleanse your pallet. Pretty awesome.  

Now the best thing was that if it is your birthday, they make you an entire cake for free! And then they take a picture of you, print it out, and place it in a Gibbys photo holder. Pretty awesome service for freeing you ask me! Service was so fast and efficient. Definitely recommend the place!"}
{"text":"As with the other reviews, they start you off with the pickles, bacon and bread.  Pickles were great but with dinner and wine, a little odd.  Started with the onion soup and mussels.  Both were very good.  Mussels were drenched with garlic, butter and bacon.    Could not stop dipping the bread into the sauce.  Onion soup was classic french onion done well. Ordered the jalepeno sausages and rib steak, Gibbys cut for main course.  The sausages were good not great and the steak was average.  Ended with the gibbys chocolate desert.  chocolate is always good but this was a little different with crunch that reminded me of stale rice krispies.  Some other tables ordered the apple desert that looked awesome.
Atmosphere is what you would expect of Old Montreal and service was very good. Total check was $205 with tip for two people.  We did have a great bottle of Bordeaux  ."}
{"text":"No trip to Montreal is complete without dinner at Gibby's.  They start you off with amazing pickles, bread and wine.  The steaks are delicious and consistently cooked to perfection. The menu is diverse, the wine list is amazing and the ice cream stuffed crepes are life changing!!  This is seriously my favorite restaurant in Montreal.

The atmosphere is romantic and old world charming.  The service is fabulous.... even on the busiest of nights.  There's nothing I would change. 

We usually go to Gibby's at least twice per visit to Montreal.  I'm already looking forward to our next meal there!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner tonight. I had the Beef Wellington. My son had the rib steak. My wife and daughter split a huge piece of Arctic Char. All meals came with a generous salad, twice baked potatoes, sorbet, asparagus and other items. We had escargot and shrimp bisque for appetizers. Everything was cooked perfectly. The service was terrific, friendly but not too over-the-top. We had mentioned that we were visiting Montreal for my wife's birthday and they brought her a birthday cake, not a piece of cake, nor a cupcake, complete with candle. A very nice touch. We left totally satisfied and grateful that we make the trip to Gibby's.
The building is beautiful exposed stone. Although the tables are close together, the room was not too loud and we could talk with the others at our table.
A wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Once again went to Gibby's on Christmas Eve with a few friends as we have done for the past several years.

Food is very good.  Service was good.  We would have preferred to sit in the main dinning room.  That would have made the evening perfect."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal and experience at Gibbys during a recent vacation to Montréal.  Needed to call for a reservation and glad we did!  The food was very good - my husband and I each had a steak and twice baked potato, plus the bread and pickles served to the table.  The restaurant is quite large though staffed very well and we didn't wait for anything.  Our server, Linda, made it a fun night and one of the highlights of our trip!"}
{"text":"I went to Gibby's for my birthday a few years ago and loved it. They made it so special for me and my friends. So I went back recently with my husband, had the same thing as the first time  (beef Wellington) and it was so awful. The Monte Carlo potato was amazing and thank god it was because it's all I could eat on that plate. Even the starter salad was disgusting, tasted like old leftovers from a dorm room fridge. This place is supposed to be legendary and for the price it should be every.single.meal. Never will I go back to this dated cave with bad beef."}
{"text":"Great place for steak.  A group of us that live in Boston visited Gibbys and found the steak to be as good, if not better, than the high end Boston steak houses.  The prices were similar so this is not an inexpensive place, however the price includes a salad and a side which is not the same as Boston.  We found the sauces to be excellent and tried the au poivre and the bearnaise and both were great.

Atmosphere was great and the waiter was excellent.  We arrived early and the place was full but they had a great outdoor area for us to wait in.  The only issue we had at all was the waitresses and waiters outside never stopped at our table so we could have drinks while we waited.  We tried to flag down one of the waitresses and she said someone would be right with us.  My guess is they were very busy and somehow our table was forgotten.  

Anyone know what you are supposed to do with bacon that they bring out with the bread?"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Would recommend to anyone visiting Montreal. Their Gibby salad is to die for! I had the prime rib with stuffed baked potato for dinner and it was amazing. Decor is very cool and I ta tie, and my service was amazing."}
{"text":"Typical steakhouse atmosphere and decor. In old Montreal which has a quaint area and vibe.

Believe it or not...this is where I had one of the best ribeye. Not just me, people I brought along were quite pleased and we repeated a visit when we came back here again.

Montreal is not exactly known for steak but the Gibby's Cut is juicy, tender and you want to savor every bite. Comes with side and appetizer. 

Cost is comparable to high-end steak in most places but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Great steaks, great wine, valet parking. 

I've  be been here a few New Years in a row, great family environment right by the fire works by the port of Montreal for the 12 o'clock hour. 

Reasonable high prices, if you compare to NYC or PHL it's in line. But for Canada it's expensive. 

Old chatoe  that is a restaurant. Very rustic but quaint. 

Love the place and excellent food."}
{"text":"Probably the best steak house I've ever been to. Easily beats anything in New York City. The salad was huge and fresh. The beef was seasoned and prepared perfectly. 

The best thing about this restaurant is the service. The staff here are the best I've ever seen. A flawless dinner service for a group of 9.

The building is kept immaculate for a 200 year old structure.Yes, it's pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best steakhouses in town. First off, you are given homemade bread and pickles, both of which are delicious. I ordered rib eye steak and it was perfectly cooked. The place is also very nice, keeping the old look to it."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Had the filet mignon and it was cooked perfect.  The atmosphere was very quaint. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Weird lighting inside, it's kinda of an orange vibe.... but not a big deal because the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome meat main courses, served with side and appetizer, as well as complementary sherbet before the main course and mint chocolate wafers after it. Good service, great food."}
{"text":"Was recommended to us as one of the best steak houses in Montreal.  We ate downstairs, which had a nice ambiance with stone walls, but was very loud.  Not sure if they had the a/c on as it became very warm as the night progressed.  

Good wine selection, especially if you are a French wine fan.  I had the oysters Rockefeller, which were well executed--not too much spinach and breading, which is too often the case at other establishments.  I had the rack of lamb, very nicely presented with mint jelly. Very tender.  My wife had the eggplant parm, which she said was tasty. For desert, she had the creme brûlée.  The custard was perfect, but the sugar topping was not crunchy as it should be.  I had the chocolate desert, which was over the top.  

A little pricey, but not to the point where you question the value.  The place could use a little freshening up in terms of the carpeting."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. We went there on a Friday night, expecting a wait to be seated and another way to find a parking space. We were wrong on both counts. They have valet parking and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, considering my lack of fluency in French. The restaurant is in old town, sat in brick, which of the fashion of the area. The interior carries out the same thing in this relatively large restaurant. Although large, each table achieved a degree of intimacy. A unique feature of Gibbys is the fact that all dishes are served on pewterware. Never seen this before, but it did add an elegant touch. Uniquely, on the table was a bowl of sourdill whole kosher pickles and a small cup of bacon bits.
For appetizers, my partner and I shared mussels Provençal and escargot. The former was outstanding and the latter excellent. We shared the rack of lamb, which was huge. They split the dish for us each receiving four lamb chops. They were just delicious. Even though it was split, each of us was allowed to pick our own side dishes. The baked stuffed potato was a standout. Even though we shared the meal, we were both too stuffed for dessert.
All in all, this was definitely a five-star experience!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal, charming dining room (a bit on the loud side). Service was excellent. Gibby's has a very large wine selection with a wide range of prices. The onion soup was superb. The salad was fresh and served with a homemade house dressing. We had the osco buco and the petite filet with grilled lobster tail. All fantastic. We met some locals while dining there and they told us this is the place to go. I would recommend giving Gibby's a try. Make reservations as the restaurant is very busy."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED Gibbys!  The place itself was charming and full of history.  When we first were seated, I did not like the table we were at (we were seated right where you walk in and it was our anniversary and I wanted something a little more out of the way) and asked if we could move.  The staff was excellent and without thinking twice, immediately moved us and apologized. I was very grateful as they were busy and did it with a smile.  Our server was excellent and very friendly...explained everything along the way.  I ordered the Beef Wellington and it was delicious!  I could not believe the size of the filet they give you in this dish. My husband had the Steak Diane and I must admit was out of this world. The cuts of meat were excellent and cooked perfectly. The sauce was amazing. I would highly recommend Gibbys for a wonderful night out with amazing food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"First of all, this is a MUST if you're in Montreal!!
I visited from los angeles and had to stop by. 
Made appointment 2 days in advance for 7:30, showed up at 7 and got seated within 5 mins. Got a great table by the fireplace. Great service! Host/waiters were beey friendly and super helpful! 

Before ordering, we were given some brrad and pickles. The bread was super fresh and tasted amazing!! The pickles were super juicy and tasted great!!
I ended up ordering a rib eye steak gibby style medium rare. The steak was super tender and was topped off with some peppercorn sauce which was super good! One of the best steaks I've tried and was well worth the money. 
Overall this place was great and would recommend it to any steak lover."}
{"text":"i have been eating there for 20 years and i have never had a bad meal. i'm not the biggest fan of steak and yet i still love it there....the chicken kiev is amazing. the rack of lamb is sick....best desserts ever!...and what a great spot in old Montreal and it has valet parking for free...and the staff is super friendly and accomidating"}
{"text":"Oldskool steakhouse in old Montreal.  I found it through Yelp and decided to check it out while I was on vacation this summer in Canada.  Yelp did not let me down!

Old Montreal gives the restaurant ambience by location, but when you walk inside, you get the feeling you're in an old place.  You can almost picture folks huddled around their mugs in an old tavern talking about the days' events in the 1800s.  It's dark inside, but also inviting, and the restaurant was filled with boisterous patrons enjoying a fine meal!

The food is classic steakhouse, with very choice cuts and classic styles like Beef Wellington, Steak Diane, Au Poivre, and Bearnaise.  They have chicken (Chicken Kiev too!), and a variety of fresh seafoods and salads as well.

They serve a dish of fresh homemade pickles to every table, and they are fantastic!  Gibby's is a can't miss restaurant in historical old Montreal.  A little pricey, but absolutely worth every penny!  I strongly recommend making reservations beforehand.  I was dining solo, so they were able to find me a little spot downstairs, but the restaurant was very crowded - another indication of a top notch restaurant!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friday night dinner... reservations at 8...promptly seated...the bread, bacon and pickles is a nice touch... the Gibby salad was very good and it was a large portion! I had the teriyaki steak with baked potato and my date had the filet and Monte Carlo potato... steaks were Devine! Potatoes were excellent as well. Dessert was key lime pie and Sherbet ... only drawback was the service was a bit slow and the waiter brought my pie but we waited 15 minutes on the sherbet.... in his defense he was dealing with a very large party... all in all highly recommended"}
{"text":"Worst steak I've ever had and it was supposed to be a filet. Overlooked. I'm sure there is better food on the menu but the price point didn't meet the quality. Good staff service though and that counts for something."}
{"text":"Rated one of the best steakhouses in Montreal, for what, I'm not sure. I must admit the location is prime: right in the heart of Old Montreal and the restaurant has been there for a very long time. I guess that's why people like it so much. 
1- ordered a half a dozen of oysters, one of them was a bad oyster (could have gotten poisoned). 
2- my bloody Cesar was probably one of the worst I've ever drank. 
3- waiter took 5-10 minutes each time I asked him for something.
4- the fillet minion was ok. Definitely not worth the money. 

It's overpriced and overrated. 2 stars because the valet driver was amazing."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of dressy venue dining, but fortunately, I allowed my friends to talk me into eating at Gibby's.  

The entrance to the restarant is through this amazing courtyard enclosed by old timbers and heavy stone.  You are instantly transported to another time.  The dining area is dated, not in a dusty and old way, but in a antique and time-honored way.

The homemade bread and pickles were probably my favorite part of the meal.  I could have eaten a whole jar of the pickles if they sold them that way.  For my main, I had the fish special of the day.  It was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  After reading more reviews, I wish I had ordered a steak and had dessert or at least one of those snazzy coffees!

Gibby's may be considered a tourist trap, but hey, I was a tourist and a good experience at Gibby's left me with great memories of Old Montreal.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A 17th century structure updated with modern conveniences but still holds an old world elegant flare. Our waitress,  Isabelle, was both knowledgeable and helpful in our selection of wine and food with 36 years of experience.  The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the Youville rack of lamb (8 ribs!) was simply amazing. Be certain to have the Monte Carlo potato and the Gibby's Chocolate Delight for dessert. The Brazilian Coffee Flambé is both a show and  delicious!"}
{"text":"I know Gibbys is a great steakhouse, but when I went I was in the mood for fish. The swordfish was awesome, and I also tried the salmon which was out of this world! I started off with the oysters, which came with a side of horseradish and cocktail sauce, which I also highly recommend. By the time dessert came I was stuffed, but saved room for the complimentary chocolates! Aside from the great food, the service and decor are great!"}
{"text":"This is an expensive restaurant, but I highly recommend to go if you are visiting and/or you are a meat lover. 
We went for dinner in a Friday night, we booked 3 hours before so I cannot complain about that. We didn't have the best table, but the ambiance inside is very good wherever you are sitting. The restaurant is very cozy and warm and you really feel like back in the days when you are inside.
About the food... I'm a steak lover, so when we arrived and saw the menu I was pleased to see that many options. The rib steak \"gibby's cut\" is amazing! I loved it and it was perfectly cooked. The portion was huge and the sides complements were also well served.
We ordered creme brûlée for dessert and it was also not disappointing at all.
The menu appetizers looks good as well, but if you are having a steak do not order anything extra or you will not finish everything.
Service was not the best, but in a Friday night there're not too many restaurants that can offer excellent service; it was not bad at all, but for the price you're paying, of course you expect an excellent service.
This is my best recommendation for a steakhouse in Montreal so far, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I wish they had a place like this in DC! It's tucked away in old town; the restaurant itself is sort of in the basement. Surrounded by old grey stones, like a crypt; up on the first floor they have this regal bar. Looks like something of out the Godfather set, with maroon leather chairs, and heavy oak tables. Has a great selection of beers including some local brews.

 Once you make your way down to the dining hall, don't try to count calories or (Canadian) dollars, and just go with the recommendations. They whipped out this great baked mussels dish. Loaded with butter and garlic, they had these enormous mussels actually baked into a clay dish. Then I got the Dore Amande, Canadian wall-eye, baked with a side of potatoes and greens. Simple as can be, but damn good. I think it was combination of how they probably poached it half an hour before and what they seasoned it with (and probably because they poured loads of butter on it). Chasing it down with sauvignon blanc.

 Risking not being able to walk to the taxi outside, I couldn't resist their chocolate cake, and had to obviously pick a nice single malt to wrap things up.

All in all, if you're in Montreal, don't miss out on Gibby's."}
{"text":"OMG... The lamb... the lamb... the lamb... Shared a large sirloin steak and took a chance on the lamb... holy sweet Jesus... the lamb stole the show. The portion is ridiculous as they gave 8 pieces and it was juicy, tender and delicious. It was perfection along with the mint jelly. The great thing about Gibbs's is that the sides are included. So you don't have to spend another $8-$12 per side like most steak houses that are comparable. 

If you don't understand my post... get the lamb!  :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Great ambiance. Had the oysters, nice and fresh. Onion soup was excellent. I got the rib eye, wife got the Wellington. Can't go wrong with either. If you are in old town, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant a better review, but sadly I cannot.  As a Gibby's patron for the last 30 years, I have always enjoyed my experience immensely, but I will not be returning to this once revered Montreal establishment. 

Our party waited over 45 minutes after our reservation time to be seated, and the host was incredibly rude, blaming us for not checking in with him, when we had gone to see him 3 times prior to being seated.  Several other patrons had been waiting 30 minutes past their reservation time as well.

The manager unfortunately did not help matters.  Recognizing the issue at hand, he offered complimentary drinks or dessert, but his demeanour quickly became highly offensive when after providing the drinks, he said \"Are you smiling now? Give me a smile.\" 

That said, the food and wait staff have always been and continue to be exemplary, but the host and manager have been enough to dissuade me from ever going back to a family favourite.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It was a very delicious! Really enjoyed the time with my friend there. Nice decoration!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Montreal for steak and seafood.
Quite and elaborate menu that you can't go wrong with.
Escargot, salmon and beef Wellington were good choices.

A great wine selection that goes well with the food.

Don't miss out and treat yourself to fine cuisine !"}
{"text":"Magnificent meal and a pleasing environment.  A noise level in the main dining room that is a tick louder than I am used to in an establishment such as this, but all you do is lean in a little to hear your dinner companion.  With that out of the way...I saw the Wellington and Monte Carlo mentioned here on Yelp often so I knew what I was having before we were seated (recommend calling ahead as we did).  The meal was all I could imagine along withe the pickles and fresh bread and a Gibby's salad.  My date started with amazing half-shell oysters and went for a clean plate with a baked potato and the filet (unless you have a hollow leg do not be ashamed to get the petite cut because the standard entree is abundant).  Had to go all-in with Creme Brulee for her and Coupe  Dame Blanche  (a sweet hot fudge sundae w/ vanilla ice cream we call it back where I come from).  This is a meeting spot for families and groups looking to celebrate and quiet pairs like my girlfriend and I (but tonight there were more of the former); so I wouldn't call it romantic.  But the surroundings are warm and the staff is skilled at what they do best and really keep things moving well (but not rushed)."}
{"text":"Gibbys used to be our go to steakhouse spot in town whenever there is an occasion or friends/family visiting. The quality of the meal dropped significantly over the past few months...would not go back..."}
{"text":"I went here awhile ago while on a business trip. Locals recommended the place, so I felt like I couldn't go wrong. It's like a hidden gem in Montreal; if you didn't know to look for the tiny Gibby's sign on the door, you would literally walk past the place. This restaurant defines luxury: phenomenal service, sumptuous food, and a warm ambiance. Steaks are king here, but the seafood is equally as good. I will definitely return during my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Loved it! Went for annniversary dinner with friends on a trip to Montreal. Our steaks were cooked to perfection unlike some of the other reviews have said. Medium rare & delicious. The atmosphere is not upscale but it is very Old Montreal. Our waitress, Linda, was an absolute delight who guided us to moderately pricd wine rather tha nudging us toward a more expensive one. Even my vegetarian husband was satisfied with his eggplant dish. 
Not cheap but hey, it's Montreal!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was excellent! Loved he pickles, bread and bacon to start with. We both got steaks (I got the Wellington) and we were both impressed except both found the food lacked a little seasoning. Still would definitely recommend this place to anyone and just suggest you add a little salt!"}
{"text":"Gibby's would certainly fall into the category of \"fancy\" dining options.  This is a not a casual place, so no sneakers and shorts please you filthy begger; you must dress properly for this special evening.  

  The building itself is positively gorgeous, and was built in the 18th century.  I love the iron gates and the beautiful courtyard, and the stone interior transports you back in time to a period over 200 years ago......very romantic.  Women love this place, hearts swoon, certainly a good option for us guys to bring a special lady.  Most importantly, the food is quite good.  But what the hell is with that little bucket of pickles they bring you?   I dont get that.  I do, however, very much appreciate the sorbet served between courses to help refresh the palate.  Always a nice touch. 

In closing I'd highly recommend Gibby's for a romantic or special evening, and you can touch off your night with a moonlit walk through the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal and stroll along the waterfront.  With a simply magical night such as this, how could you not get some?"}
{"text":"My husband insists that we eat at Gibbys every time we go to Montreal.  His family, both American and Canadian have been patronizing the restaurant for at least the past 50 years. According to my husband, it is one of the few primarily English establishments in Montreal. 

The atmosphere is cozy, the wait staff is professional, and the food is consistently good. On our last trip, I got a  fish dish (it was just okay), my husband got the lamb and our friend got the rib eye. Both were raving about their food the whole dinner. This is definitely a red meat type of establishment. 

And save your appetite, the portions are large and the bread they serve beforehand defies description. It is incredibly fresh. 

I read some reviews where people were confused by the bacon bits on the table with the bread and pickles... I finally found a use for them. Great to add to your baked potato side and salad.

The salad dressing is one of my husbands favorites, and is luckily available by the bottle now.

This is a great place to go in Old Montreal if you are looking for somewhere cozy on a frigid Canadian night.  After eating here every time we go up, though, I'm tempted to try something different next time..."}
{"text":"I was convinced by the waiter to get the Arctic Char instead of the Salmon.  This morning, I've just thrown most of it back into the ocean.
The service was actually very nice.  The couple next to us was celebrating an anniversary and they gave them a free cake!
The waiter offered to take the fish back when he realized I didn't like it.  I decided to keep it because I know it is a healthy fish, and because I didn't want to hold up my husband's meal, and I didn't want to wait myself for a whole new meal.  I didn't realize I'd still be repeating it this morning."}
{"text":"I do not enjoy visiting a steakhouse frequently for a health reason since quite some time ago, but if someone asked me what's my favourite place for a steak in Montreal, I would've picked Gibbys without the experience tonight. Gazpacho was really not good so I couldn't finish even a third; Beef Wellington was rare when I ordered medium rare (but still good one!); Gibby's cut rib steak was in much lower quality than before (better at Baton Rouge if I may); Monte Carlo potato was bland but salty; Rockefeller oysters were bitter (having assumed that they put too much liquor into the sauce or cheese), so we returned those and had the fresh ones but they were pretty much the same.
After the waiter was told that our last time visit \"together\" was a year ago, his manners became changed and kind of rude/condescending thereafter. What a strange guy. Gibby's service couldn't be better before if I remember correctly. Too bad. 

Compared to the previous experiences, only the decor (&servers' uniform) is still lovely. (still nice service at Valet parking, and classy ambience though)
So,,I'd rather go to Moishes or other excellent restaurants, believing now people's saying \"overrated.\" Always feeling disappointed to see a favorite restaurant change."}
{"text":"Gibby's is a very cozy steakhouse in a great location in old Montreal.  I stopped in with a group of coworkers and had a very pleasant experience.  The service was friendly and extremely professional.  This is probably the norm for steakhouses of this caliber, but I don't typically eat at places this fancy.

I ordered the \"petite\" filet-mignon because I wasn't feeling too hungry, and that turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made in a while.  It was still a very large piece of meat and  I struggled to finish it.  A few of my coworkers got individual steaks that could have fed a family of four.  We also ordered a few bottles of wine which were all very good.

Overall it was a good experience, and given its proximity to my hotel, I would likely return again."}
{"text":"If you're cost-conscious, just share an entree with someone because Gibby's portions are quite big.  So there's no excuse to skip Gibby's if you're in Montreal, no matter the budget.  Everything we've tried are good (lobster tail, gibby's cut, lamb chop, nova scotia lobster).  Bread always taste fresh and goes great with the optional bacon bits and pickles that are also on the house. The potatoes, salad and asparagus that accompany the entree were always great.  

Gibby's cut makes steaks from other Montreal restaurants look like a joke.  The difference is unmistakable."}
{"text":"I'm from the states, so I'm not sure the standard for Canadian steakhouses. I'll make the review short, and say that while the food was good, it was nothing spectacular, and I'm not sure it was worth the price. The service was good, the ambiance was okay. Honestly, Morton's is just as good or better."}
{"text":"This place was packed - strongly recommend reservations.  Host was very accommodating, estimated seating at 30 minutes but didn't even have time to order drinks in the lounge before a hostess sought us out to be seated.

Lounge: restaurant was filled to capacity, but only a few people in the bar area.  Dim lighting, comfortable seating by the fireplace, rustic stone walls and rough hewn timbers spanning the ceiling.

Tables in the restaurant are very close together, and atmosphere is loud. Same rustic look throughout.

Service was quick, bordering on brusque. Food promptly served and quick transitions between servings.

Lobster stuffed fillet was perfectly cooked and with just the right amount of lobster.

Wellington fillet: cooked on the rare side, very thin puff pastry wrap and delicious gravy.

Monte Carlo potatoes: twice baked - the way to go.

Bread served before meal with butter and chopped bacon in a dish.  Milk bread? Incredibly fresh and smooth texture.

Chocolate cake, get it with some port.  Definitely big enough to share."}
{"text":"Gibbys is as great a steak house as they come. Located in the heart of the old port you get an amazing feel of the older part of town. If arriving by car you are greeted by valet who handles the hassle of locating parking in this area. The main entrance is beautiful courtyard and a rustic wooden door. Wherever you are seated you'll get this great warm feeling as the atmosphere of the restaurant sucks you in. My go to order is the fillet mignon with Dianne sauce. I have never been disappointed by this cut and always have it cooked just right. For dessert a flambé coffee is the way to go. If you still have room you can grab any dessert or simply munch on a mint chocolate in the shape of the iconic gibbys door. Worth the splurge every time !"}
{"text":"I love this place so much; I think it has to be one of the Crown Jewels of Montreal. The ambiance, the service, the food, the personal touches, the quality, all excellent.

This was our second time here. Their bread is so delicious, kind of like pretzel bread, and they also give you some tasty homemade pickles, and even a little dish of fresh bacon bits. What more could you ask for? Fresh bread dipped in bacon bits? Yes, please. We (two of us) ordered some French onion soup to share, it was cheesy and delicious. We also ordered a ribeye to share with their Monte Carlo potatoes, and it was more than enough for both of us. Their ribeye is cooked perfectly at medium rare, with an excellent crust, perfectly marbled, garlic & spices in abundance, and no shortage of juicy flavor. Their house salad is great, throw some of those bacon bits on there too along with their house garlic croutons. If you don't have room for some of their delicious creme brûlée, don't fret, because you can satisfy your sweet tooth with a bite of their complimentary homemade dark chocolate with a hint of mint and the perfect balance of sweetness. Their wine list is to be envied by most places, particularly their delectable Bordeaux available by the glass that pair perfectly with any steak. 

This place is a MUST VISIT in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food was excellent, staff was helpful, nice and courteous. Although I was there with somebody who spoke fluent French  the staff was very nice to us who spoke English and were glad to speak English as well. My steak was excellent and the deserts were amazing. The building is a very historic spot and near St. Mary's Cathedral."}
{"text":"We ate here this past weekend for my brother's bachelor party.  We wanted to go to a steakhouse one night, and our hotel concierge recommended Gibby's to us.

We were a large group (22), so we sat in 3 separate tables next to each other, which was fine.   The decor is nice and old fashioned.  Our waitress was funny and nice, and we received excellent service from her.

I ordered the rib-eye steak (Gibby's cut) and the Monte Carlo baked potato.  Both were delicious.

However, there was one extremely disappointing thing about Gibby's that prevents it from getting a five star review. The total bill (including tax and tip) was about $2700.  We asked the waitress if we could have a round of Jameson shots on the house as we paid the bill.  She said she had to ask the manager - she returned and informed us that our request was declined.

When you spend $2,700 on dinner, I don't think asking for a round of shots on the house is unreasonable.  The previous night, Weinstein and Gavino's gave us a free round of shots without us even asking, and our bill was significantly lower than $2,700.

Bottom line: the food was excellent and so was our service, but the management is low class."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM is really all I need to say about this place! Classy, delicious, and fun. It can get pretty crowded, so reservations are needed, especially on weekends. Their baked potato is a MUST try....and needless to say of course, their steaks are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. The service was impeccable. Our steak was a little drier than expected."}
{"text":"Delicious HUGE portions and wonderful wait staff! We also got the Brazilian coffee flambé, which was so cool so watch them prepare, delicious, and very alcoholic! Could easily share the coffee and entrees between two, but why would you when the prices are so reasonable!? Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Gibby's is a great place to visit and dine if you are in Old Montreal area. Be sure to make reservation. I hear that the restaurant used to be a place for locals, but after visitors invaded the place. It has attracted more tourists. The place is loud and full of fun energy. The FOOD..yum. steak is cooked to perfection. As many reviewers agreed, the twice baked potatoe is quite good. I had the lobster tails entree (3 tails) and leftover to take back to hotel for lunch the next day. 

Gibby's, see you on our next visit ! 

P.S. casual attire. We wore shorts, t-shirts and sandals. 
P.S.S. bring a fat wallet !"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with great service! How can you go wrong when you start out with pickles! Excellent fine dining! Expensive! 400$dinner!"}
{"text":"Hotel booked us a last minute table after a mistake at other restaurant. We were sat right away even a bit earlier than we expected. They start you off with pickles, bread and a bowl of bacon bits. We both ordered the onion soup it was very good. Gibby's house salad was just ok. I ordered the beef Wellington medium rare one half of it was completely raw and non edible. Wife ordered the Gibbys rib medium rare  it was huge and a bit over cooked. The monte cristo potatoes were very good. Portion size was large so even if the temp control was on point we would never of finished the meal anyway. We saw almost every one walk out with doggie bags. Maybe a Saturday night is not the best time to go with them being so busy they can't get one tables temps correct."}
{"text":"Gibby's was so fantastic that we went there two nights in a row during our recent stay in Montreal! While the place can get crowded and the atmosphere can get a little loud, the tables are large enough and far enough apart that you don't feel too constrained. The building (inside and out) has a very old-world feel - lots of stone and wood and fireplaces. It was very warm and welcoming.

But the food is where Gibby's was really perfect. Let's start with the bread - amazing. A hot loaf of pretzely/sourdoughy bread arrives at your table with lots of butter, pickles and bacon. Very fine. I was tempted to ask for a loaf to bring home with me. Our meals (I think all meals?) came with a salad-like starter option. We picked the regular salad option (although there were others), and the salad was plentiful and had a very delicious and light dressing. After the salad, we were given little cups of lemon sherbert, which was light, tasty and the perfect amount. 

The entree was incredible. Both my husband and I had the petit filet mingon, which was cooked perfectly, topped with garlic and herbs, and accompanied by mouth-watering, burst-of-flavor-in-your-mouth asparagus stalks and (we chose) a plentifully large baked potato. The filet was as easy to cut as butter and melted in our mouths. It was definitely one of the best steaks I have ever had and, while we didn't take anything home, they certainly didn't skimp on the portions. 

We finished up with the chocolate mousse which (again) was plentiful and mouth-wateringly good. With the bill they also give you some mint-dark-chocolate squares, which were a nice treat. 

The service was excellent. Our waiters were professional and answered questions. At the end of the meal, Gibby's (like other restaurants we saw in Montreal) settles your bill right at the table with a hand-held electronic system which is fast and easy. Overall, the experience was great from start to finish, and I'm so glad Gibby's was recommended to us."}
{"text":"We are tourists in Montreal for a few days. My wife wanted a steak and Gibby's was listed on the hotel restaurant list. We were a little concerned about what would be acceptable attire since we were running around the port all day and didn't even bring dressy clothes. At Gibby's, you can go and be comfortable in shorts & a golf shirt (like me), jeans, dressed up or anywhere in between.

The building and decor are phenomenal, even if you show up without reservations (like us) and upstairs is full...downstairs is really nice also!

The wait staff were very professional, but would read the tables and be goofy / humorous if that was how your party was. We had Michel as our server and his interactions with us and busting my 14 year old son's chops was wonderful, but all still with superb service. The food was great; two of us had Chicken Kiev which was really good, one Beef Wellington which was cooked to perfection and very tasty, and one teriyaki steak which was a thick, juicy and perfectly prepared medium. Deserts were also outstanding!

This restaurant is not cheap, but compared to lower quality places nearby, the slightly higher price is well worth it since you get such a higher quality meal and service. 

Kudos!!"}
{"text":"This a good place to eat a grill lobster.  The portion are big and good quality.  The restaurant can also be crowded and a little loud. Good place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I had the fillet mignon Wellington and the Rockefeller oysters as an  entree. Wine can be ordered per glass, at a very reasonable price. The total is expensive, but you are well stuffed with amazing food. The only downside is that it's quite expensive. My bill came to $300 with tip, for two."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best steakhouses in Montréal. My friend and I were visiting briefly and heard of Gibby's through a work colleague. 

When we arrived, we were surprised to see how hidden away it was. But we were even more delighted by the inside decor.

The staff's service was above board and the food was out of this world. I had the New York Sirloin (16 oz) which was huge and excellent and my friend had the most tender lamb ever.

One of the best. Go here."}
{"text":"Really good steakhouse, friendly waitress...but the thing I will always remember about Gibby's is the cozy atmosphere.  Apparently, the building is over 200 years old and was formerly used as a stable.  The building is made of stone and there are wooden pillars all around.  It reminded me of a medieval garage.  I imagine it would be the perfect place for dinner on a cold Montreal night.  Definitely a one of a kind place."}
{"text":"As I work through my way of trying the best steak in Montreal this has remained the king. Suggest to get the Gibby's cut rib steak. Massive but so good. Unlike other steak houses that char the outside, they grill it properly. The bread, pickles are great as is the salad. The twice baked potato is quite delicious. Didn't like the beef sausages but who cares it's about the beef. Creme Brule was and still is one of the best I've had. 

Ambiance and service are both great.  Highly recommend going to anyone with the means."}
{"text":"Not enough can be said for both the quality of the food and service at Gibby's.  Fresh seafood, great steak and good wine selection."}
{"text":"Very nice steakhouse. Expensive but you get what you paid for. Ambiance and decor is definitely old school, maybe a bit more crowded than I'd like with most of the way the tables are laid out, but we were a large party and sat towards the back in a slightly more spacious area. Steak was excellent, cooked perfectly. Pretty good drink selection too from beer to wines and also a full liquor bar."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses.  GREAT wine list.  Classic : soup, salad and STEAK.  Great desserts too !  Nice ambiance walking through the cobblestones of the Old City into the stables....arrive at Gibby's.  I think a Montreal must.  I gave it a 4, I see lots of 5's..... it's not the best in the CITY, but absolutely overall, a wonderful evening......and I am a foodie...................."}
{"text":"Met some friend's here during the Grand Prix Weekend. The place was popping! Got here around 7:40 for our 8 PM reservation. They had the table ready and seated us on the spot. Ordered some drinks and a few appetizers. I had the escargot and they were perfect! For dinner I went with the swordfish that was fresh and delicious. My wife had the rib eye and it too was fantastic. Great flavor! It did seem kind of weird that the whole upstairs lounge looking area was empty. You'd think they would get a bigger kitchen and some more staff and fill that place up too when big events are in town.

In any case it was delicious and the decor both in and out was very unique. Get a reservation on the weekends though because this place was BUSY!"}
{"text":"Service was borderline passable.  Nothing spectacular for the price, but nothing to really complain about either.  Standard bread and pickles on table to start off but if you want pickles bread and coleslaw go to Moishes especially for the after 9 specials..  
Started with a salad which was extremely disappointing and kind of insulting.  it looked and tasted exactly like the pre shredded lettuce bags I get at Loblaws.  The sauce, despite the waitresses claim of being fantastic and popular no better than what is found in the grocery aisles.  
I ordered mignons of beef diane which was good.  Perfectly cooked rare, but both the sauce and steak tasted too buttery, and suggested wine pairing with dinner wasn't a hit and didn't go well with the mushrooms and sauce.  If I could have gone back I would have saved myself a few bucks and pick something cheaper as this was not a $50 dish.
All in all, I left somewhat disappointed as the food was nothing exciting, and nothing I can't get elsewhere for cheaper.  I don't mind paying a premium on food prices if justified with a nice setting or top notch serve such as Queue de cheval  and it was nice eating in the old port environment.  I'm glad I was dining with some friends and total damage was around $90  instead of ~$200 if I was with my fiance, at which point I would have left absolutely disappointed and annoyed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is expensive but so good! The pickles and fresh bread are delicious, and everything i've eaten there was good. Meals come with soup or salad - salad is a good pick!"}
{"text":"This is an old school steakhouse, so forget about a contemporary decor or an innovative menu, but if you're in the mood for a steak and a baked potato, this is the place to go. The food and service are top notch and it's a bargain compared to some of the other high end steakhouses in the city."}
{"text":"Place was just OK. Nothing spectacular, nothing bad. But I'm not coming back.

Should have avoided the place after seeing the tour bus stop up front. Maybe it was the crowd but the place was really noisy. Don't expect to be able to have a conversation unless you want to shout.

Food was a bit overpriced. We had steaks and fish. Fish wasn't the most fresh. Steak was ok. Better places and better value for money at places down the street."}
{"text":"Cut to the chase - Gibbys cut rib steak was charred to perfection. It definitely had the soft crunch texture on the outside and tender on the inside bite. I normally go medium rare plus to medium on non dry aged cuts, especially ribeye, where the fat melts into the meat a little more. It's simple and flavorful. 20 oz bone in so go easy on the apps as the portions are of a bonafide steakhouse. 

The Monte Carlo potato was a big win with the steak. Essentially twice cooked mashed potato stuffed back into the skin. 

The dining room had all the steakhouse charm with a quaint touch of Old Montreal. 

Bread & pickles for the opening is pretty good too. 

Overall great steakhouse experience. The best of the best in Montreal. A plus for being in the quarters of Old Montreal ideal for casual family or a impressive date."}
{"text":"I loved this place! This was one of the best dinners I have had in months. 

This place is old fashioned and reminded me of the type of steak houses my grandparents used to take me to as a kid. 

I love the value for the amount and quantity of food they give you. 

I had the mustard rack of lamb. The lamb tasted great and was cooked perfectly. The entree came with a delicious fresh salad, the monte cristo baked potato which was delicious, and perfectly cooked fresh broccoli. 

I had a bit of my friends rib eye and it was one of the best steaks I have had. 

The homemade chocolate dinner mints at the end were a nice touch. 

This place does dinner right and it tastes amazing. I'm making another trip to the city soon just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"It's warm, it's cozy, it's inviting. Gibby's is one of Montreal's oldest, finest and classiest steakhouse restaurants. It's hard and very rare to walk out disappointed, which has never happened in all my experiences there. It's worth every penny, and in my opinion, is ideal for the older crowds, a family get together, or celebration.

Menu favourites: Clam chowder, rockefeller oysters, crab cakes, filet mignon of beef wellington, lobster.

Topped off with my favourite desserts: Hot apple croute, and crepe jubilee

Bon appetit :)"}
{"text":"My dining staple in Montreal for sure.  Everything is simple, done simply, and done perfectly.  The steaks are perfect, the fish fresh and well-prepared, and if you like sauces on your food try the seafood crepe or the beef wellington.  The Gibby's salad which comes with the meal is fresh and tasty, and the sorbet intermezzo is a nice touch before dinner.  The wine selection is good and vast.  And the ambience , in a centuries old stone cottage is quaint and pleasant.  There are other places more fancy and more famous in Montreal...but I find myself eating here at least once a week when I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Vibe = ehh... sort of crate and barrel-esq which isn't what we expected. Steak was good but seafood wasn't as good. Service was amazing. They had our table ready immediately, we didn't like the corner they put us in and they were happy to change us to another table. Our waitress Nancy was amazing. She made us feel so special as we were there to celebrate my moms birthday. She brought a cake and took a photo of us which they printed and gave us at the end of the night. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. The room was really nice. Portions were a little bigger than I'm used to, so a little hard to walk out. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We love Gibbys.  This came recommended from a friend in Florida. Our family of three includes our 15-year-old teenager  We all had a wonderful meals including the teriyaki steak and the lamb chops. The salad and the appetizers were also fantastic. You cannot go wrong going to Gibbys"}
{"text":"Gibby's is without a doubt as good as it gets. Not only as a restaurant, but also as a life experience.

The restaurant is unapologetically unhip, rustic, and old-fashioned. From the minute you are escorted your table, it is clear that you are a VIP guest being closely looked after. Virtually everything served is made in house. They do not cut corners here and for their efforts they are rewarded with endless customer loyalty.

Upon sitting, you are immediately served with a loaf of delicious home baked bread that is still hot and has the consistency of pastry. Spread with butter and the complimentary homemade bacon bits, it's like biting into the forbidden apple in the garden of Eden.

You are also supplied with a never ending supply of dill pickles as well as full fat cottage cheese with chopped green onions (upon request). Up to this point, there is no charge for anything listed in this review.

Pair the free bites with a stiff drink or three and you are already well positioned for a great evening. Then comes the famous Gibby's salad included with every meal. It is a fairly simple salad composed of mixed greens and tomatoes. Where it excels however is with the addition of the homemade garlic dressing, homemade croutons, fresh cracked pepper, and anchovies (on request). 

After a few slices of the bread with butter, bacon bits, pickles, and salad, usually someone at the table will say that they are full and don't even need a main course. Ignore these people for surely they are deeply unhappy and damaged. They might even be a danger to themselves and the public.

The steaks here are both humongous and divine. While they don't get the same level of caramelization on the crust as some classic American steakhouses, they do come with spices and chopped garlic upon request and are usually cooked to perfection. From memory, they have 2 sizes of filet mignon, a gigantic sirloin, and the mighty ribsteak. Other spectacular dishes are the rack of lamb served in the classic style with classic mint jelly, shish kebab, and beef Wellington. 

On the seafood side, their butterfly shrimp is spectacular. You are served with about 8 or 9 huge butterflied shrimp which are lightly dusted with garlic breadcrumbs and served with garlic butter. They also have lobster tails, and fresh fish which is well prepared....but seriously, don't ruin your life by ordering the fish. We're here for a good time, not a long time.

Each meal is also accompanied by a side. Gibby's signature side is the Monte Carlo potato which consists of a twice baked potato prepared with sour cream and bacon. It is outstanding and actually goes well with the garlic butter or mint jelly if you happen to have them on your plate.

Desserts are also stellar, but somewhere between the salad and the main, even the seasoned bon vivant will throw in the towel and beg for mercy before it is offered. Most often, we are served with their (say it again......) HOMEMADE and complimetary birthday cake which is made with real butter cream and oranges or peaches. Even if you are busting at the seams, have a bite of this. It's beyond solid and tastes even better when eaten the next day on an empty stomach.

Did I mention you are served with a small cup of sorbet to cleanse the palate between the salad course and main course? Did I mention that the salad and the side dish, as well as the bread, bacon, pickles, cottage cheese, sorbet, and even mint chocolates are all included in the price of a main course? Did I mention that a meal here averages somewhere between 40-60$ per person before wine? This is what makes Gibby's a special place. While certainly not inexpensive, you get spectacular food and value for every dollar spent. I'm genuinely grateful that this place exists and in my humble opinion it continues to define the gold standard for dinner in Montreal."}
{"text":"Steak was excellent.  Edmund, our server was even better.  Unfortunately we were seated right by a waiter stand and got to know several waiters by their butts.

The constant clanging of dishes did not help either.  Good meal but pay attention to where you are seated!!!"}
{"text":"We used to come here years ago when it felt like stepping into the home of a wonderful French chef, now it is just cranking out meals riding on its name amongst us tourists having lost part of its soul. We have always lived nearby, visiting occasionally since I was young. Now over priced and past its prime. Our asparagus turned into inedible broccoli (a menu change due to availability perhaps, we did not ask), our meals not memorable as the ones from years past had."}
{"text":"Unique looking place. Early century atmosphere. Friendly and helpful servers. I ordered the new york sirloin. It was a juicy thick cut cooked perfectly. Medium rare in the center, crispy outside,  soft inside. Definitely must try."}
{"text":"Spent New Years eve here, amazing staff friendly and nice. Also the food was really good with great flavor. We loved the Gibby's Cut steak and the Lobster Tail"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this restaurant. From London Ontario my Boss told me we just had to go. The service was beyond perfect. Impeccable service from everyone. Ps the pickles are to die for."}
{"text":"This was my first time here in Montréal, I can with family to visit Québec. I must say I will definitely will be coming back to Gibby's Restaurant. We show up to Gibby's after going White water rafting. We were not dress for this type of environment and it was 7 of us who showed up with out a reservation. From the host to the waitress welcome us with open arms. It felt so GOOD!!! I asked If We needed a reservation for us to dine they told me yes, but will work something out for us. We waited all of 5 minutes and was seated to the table of Josiane, what a wonderful woman. She made us feel at home This restaurant get 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I took my parents to dinner at Gibby's in St. Sauveur on Christmas eve where we enjoyed our respective meals and left feeling very satisfied (read: roly poly stuffed!). Because I had been warned about their sizeable portions, I opted to skip the appetizer section; both my mum and I ordered the scampi, which were melt-in-your-mouth DELICIOUS. These were accompanied by rice, asparagus and a baked potato (either plain or Monte Carlo). The meal also included a starter (Gibby's salad, gaspacho or tomatoes/onion dish). I ordered the gaspacho (chilled, tomato-based blend of fresh vegetables and herbs), which was light and simple, though a bit on the garlicky side. My only complaint was that the bowl was too big! I would have been satisfied with half of what they gave me.  My mum ordered the salad, which was a bit plain but very fresh.  

My dad started with grilled jalapeno sirloin sausage, served with mango chutney. I had a bite and found them to be nothing extraordinary. The only thing that stood out for me was how spicy they were, but the meat itself was lacking in flavour.  He then had the Rib steak (Gibby's cut), which he raved about for the rest of the night - fresh, full of flavour and about an inch thick.

We ended the night by sharing profiteroles for dessert. This dessert is meant to be for one person, but it's huge - with the sizeable meal portions, there is no way I could have eaten 3 of those! They were good, but I'm pretty sure they were frozen, which was a bit disappointing.  The wine list was OK, but not great if ordering by the glass.

Overall, a great meal, but a bit over-priced. The service was OK but not fantastic.  I recommend Gibby's if you want to treat yourself, or for special occasions. Get the scampi!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. All served well presented. They have a valet service. 
Between courses you get sorbet, at the start of your meal you get bread, pickles and bacon. 
All the staff was extremely friendly. 
The flavour of food was unbeatable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Gibby's as an early anniversary dinner on our trip to Montreal. We had made a reservation, so we were promptly seated (in the downstairs dining room).

The service was fantastic - our waiter was very nice & funny and we didn't have to wait long for our food.

I LOVED the free pickles on the table and the bread was delicious. 

The pewter places and costumey uniforms on the servers added a nice old-world charm. The entire place just felt so cozy.

Food-wise, it's great. 

It's been a while since we went, but I'm fairly certain I can remember what we got!

To start, I went with the Gazpacho and my husband got the salad. The croutons were AMAZING.

We had planned on splitting a steak, but in the end, we splurged and each got the Filet Mignon (I got the petite). They were perfectly cooked and we both cleared our plates.

For dessert, we split the Crème Brûlée and Gibbys Chocolate Delight (a medley of smooth, dark and crunchy).

We were completely stuffed after, but it was totally worth it. I would DEFINITELY recommend Gibby's."}

{"text":"FOODIES: do NOT go here!!!!!! You will hate it!!

This place is the type of place my parents would enjoy.  It's dark, dingy, the server outfits are outdated, and the food is over priced.  Yet, this is a well known restaurant in Montreal so it keeps packing in the people.

Being from Texas, I know good steak, this is not good steak.  I've had better steak in Denmark.  Having traveled the world, it is rare to take a recommendation from a trusted source without first consulting Yelp but I didn't have Wifi so I went with the suggestion and now I wish I hadn't.

There is not a full service bar to eat at so if you're a single person, you will be seated at a table.  My waiter was Asian.  Nothing against him at all but from the start, you knew this was not going to be an authentic meal at all.

They bring you bread, butter, pickles and bacon pieces.  That's strange but I went with it.  All were pretty alright.

The wine selection is unimpressive to say the least.  I ordered Osso Bucco because I heard from the table next to me that the steaks were over cooked.  And I saw that the table next to me was served a well done steak.  Again, being from Texas, the cook should know better than to butcher a good cut of meat.

The Osso Bucco was a large portion and the flavor was not memorable.  As my side, I had a baked potato Monte Carlo which I was grateful for as it was the only food item I could really eat and it was not great.  On the side I was served carrots and asparagus, they were not prepared with any uniqueness at all.  They do provide you with lemon sorbet to cleanse your pallet and that tasted good, ha!  Oh, they do give you tiny chocolate square when you pay that are edible.

I don't know why people dine here, I can get better food at Texas Roadhouse.  I guess it's nostalgia?? I looked around the dining room and there were both young & old people so I'm guessing it's their reputation or name that keeps them in business.  

I wouldn't dine there again."}
{"text":"Gibbys is a sentimental favourite for me.  As a student, we celebrated graduations and birthdays here, and my husband brought me here the night he proposed.  We hadn't been back in about 10 years, so we were overdue for a return visit.  We brought my parents and my 14 year old daughter.  The decor is exactly the same, rustic and charming but slightly frayed around the edges.  Service is a delight, attentive and professional.  Steaks were very good.  They are on the pricey side, but the thing I like about Gibbys is that they include starter and sides with their steaks.  I have a real gripe with steak houses that charge you $60 for a steak and can't throw a potato and a few greens on your plate for free.  

My mom had the salmon and said it was excellent.  It was a huge serving and enough for lunch the next day.  

Mom and dad both enjoyed Irish coffees after the meal, expensive at $16 each, but prepared table side with a flourish, so worth a splurge.  The one disappointment of the night was my daughter's profiteroles, the pastry was stale and they went largely uneaten.  

It's comforting to have a few places that never change... stay classy, Gibbys."}
{"text":"Steak was quite good, but this location felt quite old, like it was not updated. Some people may feel it gives the place a unique charm, but I feel thay there are plenty of other options with nicer decor with steak that is as good if not better."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they serve pickles with the bread, but they are fantastic!  I had a hard time not eating all of them.  I ordered a ribeye that was rubbed with garlic and it was cooked perfectly!  I have been to a lot of high end steakhouses and I can honestly say this steak is near the top of the list.  I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere though.  For the price, it was pretty loud and crowded and tables were basically crammed into a giant room with very little in the way of ambiance.  The service, on the other hand, was top notch.  The waiter was excellent at being very attentive without seeming like he was hovering over us.  Our water and wine were constantly refilled and the food came out at an excellent pace."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a really proper, old school, steak house, this is it. The steak is fantastic, and they have Wellington on the menu which is such a delight. This is not a fine dining steak house, nor is it a secluded date spot, but it is a great place to have a very good meal. In fact, the steak here was better than most of the steaks I've had at \"upscale\" steak houses.

To be honest, they got me at the bacon and homemade dill pickles (which you get as soon as you sit down). I even bought a bottle of the dills to bring home with me. True story."}
{"text":"Brilliant! My work colleague had the Beef Wellington and I, Steak Diane. Both were cooked to perfection. Served with twice baked or was it thrice baked potatoes, asparagus and roasted red peppers. Beautiful."}
{"text":"What not to like about this restaurant?  The setting is beautiful and unique.  The food?  Outstanding!  And I have been to some of best steak places in NY, peter lugar included.  This place topped all.  I loved the sirloin en croute with delicious mustard sauce!  It pained me and my hubby to have to leave some behind as we had no place to keep leftovers!  Now if I can replicate this at home??"}
{"text":"After all the Yelp hype and personal recommendations, I was so disappointed to discover that Gibby's did not live up to either.  I went a couple of months ago for a work trip with 4 other people from my company, 3 of which were of the same opinion as myself about the food.  

We started with the salad with Gibby's signature dressing.  I will pat Gibby's on the back for their AMAZING homemade salad dressing... I tried to buy a bottle or two, but they were repackaging it and didn't have any on hand at the time.  I'm sorry to say the salad dressing was the highlight of the evening and things went south from there.

My coworker and I ordered the beef wellington next.  I have never tasted a more bland and utterly inedible piece of meat in my life... my coworker felt the same.  I wouldn't have taken a second bite if my boss wasn't paying $50 for the thing.  It tasted like it was barely sprinkled with salt - no other marination whatsoever.  The accompanying mushroom gravy, A1, and Worcestershire didn't help either.  I couldn't imagine how much worse it could taste reheated, so I most certainly did not take the rest to go.

Another coworker who ordered the rib eye steak was also not impressed, even after dousing it in the sauces mentioned above.  Another coworker order the fish course, which she was not fond of either.  Our team is from Texas and we've had some truly great steaks there for half the cost of Gibby's.  

The service, however, was excellent.  I couldn't bring myself to mention to our kind and attentive waiter how disappointed I was about my main course. 

If you've absolutely got to experience Gibby's, have the salad, a side dish and dessert and stay for the cozy atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Every time I visit the city I make it a point to eat dinner at Gibby's. Great steaks. Great drinks. The service is good considering how busy they get o the weekends. The prices are tourist focused so do not go there looking for a discount meal but you will not walk away hungry. No way. 

Parking in this area of the city  is very tight so there early and be prepared to search for a parking spot."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD plus the service and ambiance are incredible, too. Bar upstairs to drink while you wait for seating. Definitely try the oysters and lobster - to die for! The sorbet in between dishes really helps clear the palate and the pickles with bacon bread is a unique and yummy starter."}
{"text":"Lovely place (where they serve everything on metal plates, zomg)!

Inviting and comforting interior, great service and amazing food.

The bread they give you is amazeballs, the pickles are great too...but the bread is where it's at (ate way too much of it). 

I started with a French onion soup, it was good, I liked the sweetness it had.
For my main I had the steak Diane, $50 isn't cheap but it came with two (!) huge filet mignons.
So technically you could eat that one plate with two people, it was really that much.

On top of that it was my birthday dinner and the waitress served me a birthday cake (big enough for all four of us) and took a picture of me & company, which she later gave me in a Gibby's envelope.

It was a great evening.

So much food!

I'm coming back here for sure, but skipping the appetizers...and probably try to resist the bread (as if)."}
{"text":"Awesome place in an Old part of Montreal. The pickles, gazpacho soup, lobsters, sorbet and homemade mint chocolate are sooo delicious that I will defenetly be back for more."}
{"text":"Went here after many friends telling me this place was excellent and I have to say I was quite disappointed. My steak arrived over cooked when I asked for medium rare. By the time I got the plate back I wasnt even hungry anymore since I had stuffed myself with the Monte Carlo potato and the bread at the beginning. Moishe's is definitely better. Not sure I would give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Gibby's is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal, so my husband and I made reservations to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary on a Friday night in February.

From start to finish, I was disappointed with the whole evening.  We were given a table in the very back of the main floor, wedged between a rowdy table of 6 and only inches away from another couple.  It seemed like we were in the party section as all the other groups around us were loud and boisterous.  We asked to move to somewhere more quiet, but were told that \"It's a busy night\" and no other tables were available.  So much for an intimate, romantic evening :-(

The waiter, although polite to a fault, seemed almost passive-aggressive and a little condescending... And the usually quick service was so slow that we noticed the table beside us turned TWICE in the time it took us to receive our main course. 

Our appetizers were delicious - when we finally received them. I had the  smoked salmon and my husband had the mussels.     Both were perfection.  The main course arrived quite some time later and while my husband enjoyed his grilled salmon, my filet mignon was cold and under-cooked to the point that I could barely choke it down.  It was so bloody, it made a soupy mess on my plate - I had asked for medium-well.

Dessert was somewhat redeeming.  My husband opted for the sorbet trio, which was the perfect light ending to his meal.  I chose the more decadent chocolate delight, which was scrumptious - though had I actually eaten my main course I probably would not have been able to finish it.

Overall, the evening was a disappointment because I know how good Gibby's CAN be. It just sucks that they were having an off night on our anniversary :-("}
{"text":"FOODIES: DO go here!!!!!! You will love it!!

This place is the type of place my parents would enjoy.  It's dark, rustic, the server outfits are traditional, and the food is nicely priced, unless you are from Texas. So naturally, this is a well known restaurant in Montreal so it keeps packing in the people.

Being from the less racist part of Texas, I know good steak, this is good steak.  I've not had better steak in Denmark.  Having traveled the world, and trekked with gorillas, it is rare to take a recommendation from a trusted source without first consulting Yelp but I didn't have Wifi so I went with the suggestion and now I'm thrilled I did. Just kidding, I don't give Yelp that much credit because come on it's Yelp.

There is not a full service bar to eat at so if you're a single person, you will be seated at a table.  But fortunately I'm not single, so we got a nice table. My waiter was Asian. Nothing against him at all but from the start, I knew his race would not affect the authenticity of the meal at all.

They bring you bread, butter, pickles and bacon pieces.  That's strange but I went with it.  All were pretty alright.

We got the 20oz rib steak Gibby's cup with herbs and spices medium rare. It was near perfect. Not he best steak ever but it hit the spot. We were able to share and had leftovers. Also got lobster tail, mushroom tart, and they came with generous portions of sides. All were delicious.

We also got some wine and cognac. Generous pours. Need I say more? Oh, excellent service.

I now know why people dine here, I can't get better food at Texas Roadhouse. That's not surprising. I looked around the dining room and there were both young & old people so I'm guessing it's their reputation or name that keeps them in business.  

I would dine there again and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good restaurant overall.  The creamed spinach was nice and the Monte Carlo potatoes with the entree was very good.  The steak was well marbled and had a good consistency was ok.  For a non-aged steak it was flavored well and cooked to the right temperature.  The palate cleanser before the main meal was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Went to Gibbys to celebrate my boyfriend's 31st birthday. What a curious establishment. It feels like the type of fancy restaurant geared to families in the 1970s, but not one thing has changed since then. You get a bowl of pickles and a stick of butter with your bread to start. And they go around individually serving croutons for your salad like they're still a novelty. Food is pretty simple but if you want to dazzle it up, they'll give you a little bowl of capers to spoon on top of anything you order. In the end we really enjoyed ourselves because we got to peak into a world we never see. A world where culinary progress stopped dead in it's tracks sometime before I was born. But the food was pretty good just the same."}
{"text":"While in Montreal, I visited this place once again. The food and service is still consistently 5 Star. I even had the same 2 lb Lobster!!!! You just can't go wrong with this place. Where everyone jacks your bill up with everything a la carte, Gibbys gives you a complete meal for one price. You even get a small taste of sherbet in between courses to cleanse the palate. This is truly a must for a great business or special occasion dinner. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Classic Old School Steakhouse done right... Ordered my bone-in (Gibby's Cut) Rib Eye medium rare alla Cajun style... Perfectly seared and absolutely delicious... Go and eat here!  That is all I have to say!"}
{"text":"PROS:
-Great steaks, cooked to perfection. 
P.S. The steaks are MASSIVE (15 OUNCES!!!) :-O

-Complimentary pickles, bread, and a light lemon sorbet between your salad and entree. 

-Great place to go for steak and special occasions.

-Friendly service and not pretentious as might be expected. 

CONS:
-Not a place I would go to more than once a year."}
{"text":"High quality steaks and the like. Was here with a group of 10 colleagues for a business holiday dinner. Enjoyable, big meal complete with decent red wines and a very chocolately dessert. Cost is on the higher end but not unreasonable for the vieux port."}
{"text":"When you eat here make sure to take it easy on the bread or you probably won't have room for the rest of the meal. It comes as a warm loaf, and everyone I have eaten here with needed massive self discipline to avoid scarfing down the entire loaf.  It's a cozy place with subdued lighting. I've had some nights here with less than perfect service of my seat was out of the way, but in general it's not been a major issue. The food is good, I always order the steak when I'm here."}
{"text":"We were visiting from the US and stopped in here for some steaks. Wow. Excellent food, awesome setting. The atmosphere is really laid back, it's busy but quiet. The steaks were incredible. The desserts were great.  The coffee was to out of this world. If ever in Montreal again, would love to come back! 

Does anyone know what brand coffee they use here?  Man, would love to get my hands on some of it."}
{"text":"We came on a good friends recommendation. We took an 8.45pm booking.

On arrival the restaurant was fully occupied so we dined downstairs - which was also full. The welcome and service was friendly attentive and informative. We were given ample time to select our options. I do like the initially serving of the pickles...what a healthy and different starter.

An important aspect to selecting a main course is that it comes with a three starter option of which we choose a salad and a soup. This is built into the pricing of the main dish. The menu is dominated by fish and steak.

We really enjoyed the gazpacho soup - the salad was more basic. On the night my partner was looking for a white meat option and choose the only one, Chicken Kiev. On reflection not a wise decision given the focus of the menu.....this dish was ordinary. Conversely the Fillet Mignon was a splendid choice. Presented to perfection as was the taste.....a very substantial piece and was adequate for us both to share. 

We shared a crepe, the 'Jubilee'- it was all ice cream and limited crepe.

A good wine list and we enjoyed an Amarone, a reserve - it was drinking well. We did have to request that it be decanted.

This is not a fine establishment - it is all about the red meat (and the fish).....come with an appetite and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Once for a bachelor party and once with my wife and another couple. The food here awesome. Got the Gibby's cut steak. Massive steak. Cooked perfectly. The Monte Carlo potato was awesome. The service here really makes this place stand out in my mind though.

The first time I was there our server overheard us talking about it being a bachelor party and without warning brought us a congrats cake on the house. Amazing. Second time our server was also very attentive. It's like he knew what we wanted before we did.

Great place overall. Good price for what you get. Some of the best service I've ever had."}
{"text":"I would move to Montreal just to go to Gibby's on a regular basis.  After reading the reviews here (thank you Nicholas M), we decided to keep Gibby's on the list of possibilities.  We were up in Montreal for the weekend (basically, all day Saturday, and Sunday morning) with a hockey fan club (Go Devils!!).  After walking around Old Montreal for the day, my hubby and I went back to our hotel to freshen up and head back out for dinner.  We were staying in the trade center and there weren't too many options for dinner (or nightlife), so we wandered down Rue McGill for about 15 minutes, didn't see anything that interested us, so we went back to the hotel to get directions to Gibby's.  Thankfully, we did!!!   We walked about another 15 minutes, turned the corner, and found it - very unassuming - stone/brick front, people waiting in the alcove for the valet parking attendants to bring their cars around...we weren't really sure where the door was, but had 4 people following behind us and we wanted to get in before they did in order to get a table first!  (LOL)...  We found our way in to the packed lobby, the hostess took our name and noted that we were a party of 2, and told us it would be about 45 minutes, but we could go upstairs to the lounge and order a drink while we waited.  We said sure and were lead upstairs to a huge lounge, with only about 8 other people waiting.  We sat at a little table by the fireplace, and ordered 2 glasses of wine from the waitress.  She brought our wine and the hostess came up to tell us that our table was ready!!  The dining room was packed, but not too loud.  The decor was stone and exposed beams and after reading our menus, we found out the history of the 400 year old building (it was part of the stable and the hospital run by the Grey Nuns)....    We checked out the menu and I decided on the Grilled Swordfish special, while my husband got the full-sized filet mignon.  We noticed that all entrees came with a salad, a choice of baked potato, Monte Carlo potato (twice baked potato, blended with sour cream, bacon, and cheese - THANK YOU, AGAIN, NICHOLAS M!!), rice pilaf, and asparagus spears, so we opted out of getting an appetizer since it seemed that the entrees themselves would be more then enough.  After a loaf of tasty, fresh bread was delivered, our salads arrived, and although they were salads (with fresh ground pepper added at the table, and fresh, crunchy, but chewy, croutons, also added at the table) these were the best salads I've ever had (there was a little kick to the balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and some serious garlic...YUM)  After we finished those, a scoop of palate-cleansing lemon sorbet was brought to the table.    Then came our entrees....which were filled with one of the best meals that money can buy (or at least, the best grilled swordfish, filet mignon, potatoes, and asparagus that we've ever had) - My swordfish was perfectly grilled, with the grill marks and all - it tasted like a steak!!  It was PERFECT!  My husband ordered his filet with a  medium temperature - it was more toward medium rare (which is my choice), but definitely NOT disappointing to him nor me!  And the Monte Carlo potato...to die for!  Baked, and re-stuffed with the potato, blended with just the right amount of cheese, sour cream, and bacon, not so you could taste any one part separately, but so all parts 'blended' together into one palate-pleasing medley.  And the asparagus was good, too...  Before our meals came, we noticed some desserts going out to the tables around us and I said 'no matter how full we are, WE ARE GETTING A DESSERT'!!!  Unfortunately, we just had to finish our dinners because we couldn't stop eating, and couldn't let such a fabulous meal end - we had not one inch of room for dessert.  I asked our waitress what time they opened on Sunday, because we were going to come back JUST for dessert, but they open at 5 PM on Sundays, and we would be on our way back to NJ by then.  Next time, I WILL make room for the pastry with the apples and caramel and ice cream, or the chocolate thing that we saw passing our table....  Apparently, Gibby's is the place to go, and  you should have reservations (we found this out on Sunday, after speaking with a 'native' Montreal-an) - but we lucked out and didn't have to wait long for our dining enjoyment.  The prices were a little high (dinner for 2, with all the accompaniments and 2 glasses of wine each, came to about $100/couple) - However, it was definitely worth it for the quality meal and friendly service that we received.  PS - don't go if you are in a rush - they give you time to enjoy your experience - we were there about 2 hours...which was fine with us - We will be back, Gibby's - see you soon!!!  XO"}
{"text":"The food we had was amazing! They gave my wife a little birthday cake and took a photo of us and put it in a framed card to take home. Very cool and thoughtful. The service was a pleasure as well. The only downside is that we were leaving the next day so we could take home the abundant leftovers!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and great service. Loved our steaks and lobster. Cocked perfectly and served correctly. 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Best meal that I've had in years. Definitely stop by if you want an affordable dinner experience in Montreal."}
{"text":"Was up in Montreal for a weekend with friends, and made a reservation @ Gibbys based on a few recommendations. The setting is different than the vast majority in NYC, and surrounding areas. It has an old feel with the entrance being hidden in a stone walkway to a courtyard. As you enter you notice the exposed framework made from big, heavy timber, warmly lit, and a feeling you just went back a hundred and fifty years. The waiters wear, I'm assuming, a sort of traditional uniform and were the most polite and bubbly servers we had in Montreal. 

The recommendations were spot on, the spicy sirloin sausage was great and the Oysters Rockefeller were insanely good. I pride myself on my impeccable manners, thanks mom, but I definitely grabbed a second before confirming everyone got at least one. 

I ordered the center cut fillet, and the waitress coerced me into the Monte Carlo potato; I buckled, but assured my self I would only eat 1/2 of it. Turns out I took it right to face, killed it, it was amazing... the fillet was cooked perfectly, and with a table of 8, all ordering a various steaks, each of ours were cooked perfectly. 

We were all discussing how amazing the dinner was, thinking the ride was over. We then ordered some Irish coffees... they rolled over what appeared to be a dessert cart with a big flame in the middle... they caramelized sugar on the rim, lit the whiskey in the glass on fire (then added a little more). Added the coffee, fresh whip cream, and then lit Irish Mist on fire, and poured the flaming liquor into the best Irish Coffee I've ever had.  Gibby's is the Truth."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant, only a 3 star because they have a \"full bar\" but not able to make any drinks.
Black Manhattan- no
Boulevardier- no
Old fashioned? Yes but not able to do it correctly. No orange peel or anything.

Crappy beer selection, and basically come for the food, don't expect a good cocktail before dinner."}
{"text":"Fail-proof steakhouse, never disappoints. Service is impeccable and I enjoy the wine selection."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite restaurant on the planet. I live in New York City and this restaurant is a good 5-6 hour drive, some fridays after work i legitametly wrestle with the idea of going up for the night just to have Gibbys. The service is top notch, atmosphere is extremely rustic, almost a medieval feel but i love that. Stone walls with raw wood trim everywhere, roaring fireplace, the works.  Everytime i go i get the escargot to start which is the best ive had and the steak en croute. Its an expensive dish, no doubt, but extremely tasty and worth the hefty asking price of $42.00. Its basically breaded steak cooked to perfection, served with a warm mustard peppercorn sauce on the side. Bliss. If i were to have one gripe about this place and it is only one, that is their beer selection. Nothing from canada on tap. As a matter of fact there is nothing on tap at all. The wine selection is endless but i would love to be able to have a hearty pint of Rickards Red with my steak."}
{"text":"We came here on a friends recommendation.  The food was good, but not really a wow.  The best part was the twice baked potato. The place itself was quaint and cozy & it was nice to see old Montreal."}
{"text":"This elegant, long-standing restaurant is housed in a 200 year old stable by the waterfront in Old Montreal. I've only been here on rare occasion, for special celebrations, and the last time was over 30 years ago. I brought my daughters here tonight so they can experience one of the city's finer establishments. And I was so glad at it was just as I remembered it to be: gentile and refined with a sense of tradition and history the moment you walk in.

First, how wonderful that they offer free valet parking. I made it known that we were just coming in for desserts and coffee, and they were still happy to park my car for me (note: as many may know, parking is a royal pain in the patootie on a busy Friday night at 8pm in the summer! And nearby lots cost $15 to park in them). 

We were told they could seat is in 30 minutes, so we strolled the old port and Place Jacques Cartier Square, marveling in the business and vibrancy of this great city. Upon returning to the restaurant, we were immediately seated. Tables clothed in white linens, leather-bound dessert menus at our seats. The waitresses were all dressed in period uniforms from the last century. 

Oh, and the food was divine! My youngest had the epitome of a chocoholic's fantasy: the Chocolate Delight,which was a decadent chocolate mousse-like cake with a crunchy chocolate topping, plated on a gorgeous swirled sauce. She said it was the best dessert she ever had. Meanwhile, my other kid and I shared the Crepe Cerise Jubilee: a thin, delicate crepe with vanilla ice cream with lots of cherries (and some blueberries). This was, hands down, the best dessert I've ever had. Ever. I was in heaven. 

My cappuccino was too strong for me, but my daughters enjoyed their French teas. And how lovely, to get some dark mint chocolate medallions on our table as a complimentary treat. Very lovely gesture."}
{"text":"Wow.... What the Keg should be.

It feels so warm and cozy inside. Only way that it would feel better, would be at a ski lodge on Christmas, after a day of cross country skiing.
 The food was phenomenal and great whisky /drinks menu. Steak.... WOW!! Great portions as well.
  I most definitely would love to come back if and when I go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant in a really cool location (old horse stables), but for the cost better can be had.

For a steak house in this price range, I expect better. Check out Queue de Cheval...it's a bit more expensive but the food is infinitely better."}
{"text":"First time dining at old port and it was an amazing experience. Service was really great and friendly. Would definitively go again probably once a year since i dont have a job hahaha but yes the food was delicious. Salad comes as an apettitzer along with sorbets to cleanse your taste. I ordered the beef wellington, the beef was really tender and the sauce was compatible with it."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! We had Valerie who served our table. She is the best! Always on the beat and understand quickly our request. I ordered Guibby's cut and my mom ordered New York cut. Both steaks are amazing! And the sorbet is just devine. Even the free bread and pickles are delicious! This meal definitely worth the price and we will come back."}
{"text":"Me and my Wife celebrated our anniversary at Gibbys and had an absolute great time! Portions were amazing and the food quality was top notch. Highly recommend This restaurant to anyone wanting to have a great candlelight dinner. 

They also sent us away with a full cake after learning it was our anniversary!!"}
{"text":"Went to Gibby's for our one year anniversary. We came from NJ and my wife and I are self proclaimed steakhouse connoisseurs. We where thoroughly impressed by a combination of the decor, service and quality of food. We started with the signature Gibby's salad which was great. My wife ordered the surf and turf and got the beef Wellington.  Both meals where executed to perfection and to put the icing on the cake the meals where not a la carte which is a great thing. I definitely recommend this place whenever in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ok looks like I will have to come back again ...I was not impressed with Gibby's rib Steak perhaps, I came on the wrong day; but from a taste (let in savor in your mouth each bite for  30 seconds) perspective it did not make my top 10 steakhouse list ... The baked bread and pickles were excellent as were our side dishes. Atmosphere cosy, sweet decor, great place for a date.  Our server was a little loud excitable but friendly as compared to what you might find in other venues in other cities. I will come back I have a feeling I won't be disappointed the next time around."}
{"text":"Amazing! I went last night with my fiancé, the food is delicious and the service great! I strongly recommend to leave room for the crepe jubilee, it is so so good!"}
{"text":"According to a friend who is a local, Gibby's is an \"institution.\" It is very old and very rustic, a classic steakhouse. 

I'm not a big steak eater so I ordered the Chicken Kiev. This was the first time I ever ordered this dish and the waitress had told me to be careful but I didn't quite catch on. My first cut through the chicken caused hot liquid butter to squirt out all over my brand new top. I was a mess! Our waitress, Nadia, was very nice and brought me some club soda. You live and you learn!

The chicken was delicious, even after all that. My husband and our friend both enjoyed their steaks. We all shared the creme brûlée for dessert which was good, but nothing to write home about. 

I liked this place but since steakhouses are not really my thing, I will give it four stars."}
{"text":"Just perfect, from polite valet parking to a professional waiter namer Rainor. The food is perfect. The meat is tender and remarkably tasty, the Monte Carlo potato is wonderful. The lobster is also remarkable. All in a pleasant setting with truly professional unhurried service. Wow....I grew up in this town and have been away for years. I come here when I visit family and what amazes me is how consistently good this restaurant is. It is world class...Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"We had a company dinner at Gibby's this week for a work dinner.  Service was great, food was pretty good but the steak was overlooked.  Definitely get the Monte Carlo potato. YUM!  Great location, but I recommend sitting upstairs...the downstairs had a really low ceiling that made it a bit crowded.  Overall great spot to try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I flew up from North Carolina and had dinner on Friday night at Gibby's.  We had browsed the menu online.  She had the Beef Wellington and I had Sirloin en Croûte.  I have to say it was the best piece of beef I have had anywhere.  The portions were such that we could not eat all of it.  So we took it back to the motel, borrowed a knife and sliced it for lunch on Saturday.  Anyone visiting Montreal should go to Gibby's, but be sure to make a reservation because it is popular and without a reservation it could be a long wait."}
{"text":"Beef Wellington with monte cristo potato was delicious. Server could not have been more patient with our bachelor party of 10."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! The service was exceptional and the food was even better. If you're looking for fine dining without the exorbitant pricing, Gibbys is the place for you. While you will pay more on average compared to other restaurants, it's well worth the price of admission and you'll leave full & satisfied. The steaks savory & succulent, cooked to perfection and tailored to your preferences."}
{"text":"I live in the States about 11/2 hr drive to Gibby's.  We have been going to Gibby's for over 10 years.  When we have a visitors or something to celebrate or just haveing a Gibby's craving we will make the short trip,  It is well worth the drive.  I have eaten at all the top steak house's in the US.. Morton's, Ruth Chris, Flemings, Capital Grill and more.  Gibby's is in a class all of its own.  The combination of old world ambiance, great service, consistently great food and out of this world desserts makes it a must go to if you are in the Montreal area.  After your very satisfying meal you can roam about Old Montreal on foot or take a ride in one of the many horse drawn carriages that you will find in the area."}
{"text":"2 stars is accurate for the experience we had especially since our stay in Montreal has been a culinary extravaganza. 
The good: Napa wine and crown Manhattans
The average: the service; wasn't up to par with every other restaurant we visited in terms of sincerity and helpfulness. 
The bad: my \"Gibby cut\" was overdone and my wife's fillet was underdone-they were sent back. We were 1 of 3 tables (that we witnessed next to us) that had \"temperature\" issues. The manager did not charge us for the Rockefeller oysters which, for sure, were made with an \"Italian herb mix\" because they smelled and tasted like pizza.  Also, I pointed out to the waiter that 1) there are lots of spider webs around the picture frames that have been there a while because of the dust build up, and 2) the centipedes crawling in and out of the old stone wall were...not appealing (another table next to us, they did not have temperature issues, said on previous visits that they have had centipedes jump from the wall onto their table). 
Unfortunately, we must have hit a bad night because the Yelp reviews are spectacular, plus, two different friends from home strongly recommended this place, but, we can't deny what we had or experienced...we do not recommend this restaurant nor will we return. I hate to write poor reviews, but, with the high quality of food and service we've experienced in the last week we cannot justify the risk of another sub par meal when the city is filled with fabulous cuisine."}
{"text":"Food was average. Server was fabulous. Order the clam chowder, have a pickle, a glass of wine and desert. Petit Filet was over cooked."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak house in Old Port Montréal. The food was fantastic, and reasonably priced given the caliber of the restaurant. Our server was good, the food was even better. The bread and pickles were delicious, as was the salad. The Monte Carlo was FANTASTIC, definitely order that as your side! There was lemon sorbet in between courses, which was a nice touch. I ordered the petit filet mignon and a lobster tail- both great. I ordered the steak medium and it was perfect. We ordered the crème brulée for desert; also delicious and plenty big enough for two. I strongly recommend Gibby's. Great food, great environment. Classic steakhouse with that desirable Montréal feel."}
{"text":"Twas the night of a bachelor party, and Montreal was stirring. We'd eaten many hours ago, and our stomachs were purring. A top three steak house and dishes seemingly hard to beat; I think I would've enjoyed my meal had they just turned down the heat!

Poetry seems fun as I write this review from the air on my way back from a weekend full of debauchery in Montreal. Gibby's. Oh Gibby's. I'm torn on the rating here. We were a large group in a very crowded basement dining room (had a country club grill room feel to it).

Eight of us seated at a round table that would've been optimal for six. The trouble came when the servers had to get to the far side against the wall, a feat only accomplished by squeezing between chairs and reaching over others. Staff didn't come around much in the beginning though, and we probably sat around for 20 minutes after the drinks came before ordering any food. Meh.

Things picked up once the meal was served, so on to the important part; the meal.

Here were the orders around the room:
- Petit filet mignon
- 2 lbs lobster
- NY strip
- sirloin en croute
- tuna steak
- salmon
- halibut

They provided a lovely bib for our lobster eater; he looked like he was going to the dentist. Funny stuff. We all enjoyed our food. My tuna was expertly prepared. So you're wondering, why am I torn?

Although the featured items were great (minus one issue with an overcooked sirloin en croute), the dish also included a choice of rice pilaf/baked potato/baked potato Monte Carlo and asparagus. A lot of steakhouses only serve sides a la carte, so this was a perceived plus...

Most of us ordered the rice pilaf, which the sever described as wild rice. It tasted great, but was nothing more than plain rice with some specs in it. We each received three spears of asparagus. 

Herein lies my issue. A top steakhouse can have real wild rice and can afford to be a little more generous with the vegetable, no?

In the end, I felt that at least my dish could've been something I made myself. That's not what I expect at a top establishment. So what I felt I got was a really good tuna steak with some rice and a little asparagus that I could've made and spent less money on, all the while enjoying a drastically more comfortable dining environment. The restroom area was at least 15 degrees cooler.

The restaurant did comp our coffees because of the overcooked steak, and they also made a complimentary special cake for our special bachelor, which was very, very nice. 

Unfortunately this place left me feeling underwhelmed, especially in comparison to some of the other steakhouse experiences I've had.

All things considered, I respectfully submit three stars for Gibby's. A fine place, but I'd likely look for a new place given the chance to return to Montreal."}
{"text":"What an unforgettable experience!!! 
Their service and food were outstanding. We came here to celebrate my husbands bday while on our first visit to Montreal.  And I'm so happy that we chose Gibbys. 

I would like to start this review with a huge Thank You to our server Tammy! She was so great, attentive and had such wonderful energy. 

We ordered fillet and lobster with a side of baked potato.  The portions are massive. Their salad was delicious. Bread was sooo good. 

Little things like after the salad, gelato was served to clean your pallet. Warm water with fresh lemons was served to rinse our hands after lobster.....  blew my mind. Nothing really surprises me much and very rare a particular restaurant exceeds my expectations. This one did. 

When Tammy found out it was my Husbands birthday, they brought out a small cake with candles!!!!! Not a piece of cake but a small entire cake.  Insane! Their dark chocolates made on premises ... Delicious!!!! Apparently all is made on premises. 

She then came out with a camera to take a pic of us. I'm thinking they'll post this on the restaurants site or something. Nope. She came out with 2 printed pictures each packed in Gibbys paper card. 

Basically, their attention to detail is nothing like I have ever seen. And we as a group dined in some amazing restaurants in NY and DC. 

Again, Thrilled with our experience and will recommend this place to anyone who makes it out to Montreal."}
{"text":"This now fine dining establishment used to be a horse stable in the 1700's. Much of the stone building was still a part of the modern day restaurant today. We went on Memorial Day Monday which is not a holiday in Canada, so it made reservations a piece of cake. 

The pickles and bread that come beforehand were delicious. The odd thing though was that the bread came with a dish of bacon bits. Now, I know that bacon makes everything better, but no one was quite sure on what to do with it. However, who are we to question it. We ate our bacon and it was good!!!

Ordered french onion soup and shrimp bisque for apps. The FO soup was really good. Very traditional French presentation and flavor. The shrimp bisque was ok, but was my least favorite item during the meal. After the app course, they gave us lemon sorbet as a pallet cleanser. This was a nice touch!!!

The entrees consisted of petit filet and regular filet. They were $43 and $49 respectively. They came with asparagus and a baked potato/twice baked potato/or rice pilaf.  The steaks were both huge. Both steaks came out perfectly cooked coated with a pepper/onion/garlic seasoning that was great. We added on a side of mushrooms that were tasty as well. We also ordered 2 bottles of Cote de Rhone wine. It was delicious. On a side note, they were offering a 2 lbs lobster for only $47 dollars. Not a bad deal at all. If I did not live in Boston and was not at a steak house, I would have gone with the lobster for sure.

For dessert we shared a triple chocolate dessert. It was light and delicious and the perfect ending to the meal. They also gave us chocolate thin mints that were actually chocolate, not the standard mints that one usually sees. 

The server was friendly and nice, but disappeared toward the end of the meal. When she came back to the table smelling like tobacco smoke, we knew where she went. While we may have been her last table, this knocked a star off the review. With that being said, if you are ever in Montreal, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and decor. The old stable barn is quite the unique setting and provides great ambiance. The food was amazing: we had the sausage, shrimp and mushroom tart for appetizers and each one was superb. I had the petite filet and it was cooked perfectly. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came to gobby's on the recommendation of the hotel front desk trainee. It's interior is nothing fancy. The food and service, however were tops. The best onion soup one can expect to find in Montreal, or anywhere else in the world.  The bone-in ribeye was excellent and service very good.  Gibby's is definitely a place to put on the must-come-back-to list."}
{"text":"I can't give this place less than 5 stars. It's become a family and friend tradition when we're in Montreal. AND everyone loves the big giant juicy steak after spending a day in the sun at the F1 tracks.

The staff always treats us well here. We called about a week beforehand and they told us they were full until 10pm. We pleaded with them informing them we only come once a year and it's our favorite restaurant, so he was able to accommodate us at 7:30pm with this long table in the back for 14 people. Knowing we were hungry, the waiter brought over the pickles and bread and butter. We quickly scarfed it down and each ordered our own entree.

The table got the Gibby's steak, artic char, beef wellington and a few other steaks. My Gibby's steak, which I get in rare, was pretty good. I wouldn't say it's the best steak of my life, but it was passing. The steak was cooked to how I like it. Everyone seemed to be pretty satisfied with their meals.

I wouldn't take a date here though. It's dark and gives you that old mansion feel."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely evening with great friends over a tasty grilled & sizzled to perfection rib eye steak with unlimited bread and pickles, a delicious salad, a Monte Carlo Potato at Gibbys Restaurant (My Top 5 must eat resto) in #Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent steak! The twice baked potato is also really good. Also had the clam chowder but be aware, it's quite heavy."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Montreal to celebrate a friends birthday. We decided to try out Gibbys after reading all the reviews. We are so glad we went. To begin, this place is so nice and comforting inside. You feel like you're in a cottage with how the holiday decor looked. All the waiters and waitresses were beyond nice and helpful. We started off with a bunch of appetizers: the jalapeño sausage, mushroom tart, and French onion soup. Loved all of it! I'm not the biggest fan of mushrooms, but the tart was very tasty. The French onion soup was delicious with all that gooey cheese. The sausage came with mango chutney which paired well with it due to the sweet and spicy. At the table itself, they serve pickles, bread/butter, and a bowl of bacon bites. We were all in love. We each ordered our individual entrees (which the lady told us when ordering appetizers it's a lot of food, but we didn't care). My petite filet was good, however a little undercooked from what i had asked. Right away the waitress took it back and within minutes brought me a new plate with new sides. I was beyond shocked because usually i would just get the steak back. The Monte Carlo baked potato was really good with sour cream, bacon and chives. The asparagus was okay, a little too thick. 

For dessert we ordered a cake for my friend, which you can tell was homemade. The cake itself was very light and fluffy and the cream was a fresh buttercream. Others at table ordered the tableside Irish coffee which was a wonderful show to end our evening and it tasted so good. Once we were done (we were one of the last groups in the restaurant, we asked if they can take a picture which they did and even helped us \"stage\" the picture by picking a nice backdrop and moving the tables/chairs. 

Hands down one of the best steakhouses I've been."}
{"text":"On one of my walks through Old Montreal, I happened to stumble upon this \"horse-stable-turned-restaurant\" built in parts, between 1694 to 1850 and decided right away that this is where I wanted to have my anniversary dinner with my husband that same week. Very, very happy with our choice, the location is beautiful, the service was impeccable and the food is fantastic! All the staff were also very friendly and accommodating in making sure we got exactly the type of wine we wanted. Was a lovely anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, very friendly staff.  Had the beef Wellington.  Amazing.  Large portion but so very good you just had to eat it all.  Very knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Great traditional steakhouse with plenty to choose from on the menu. Rib eye is delicious and cooked to perfection. 

Great atmosphere and excellent service. Seafood options are great and one of our guest said the halibut was great. 

You won't go Hungary here with the big portions. 

Will be back when we come to town."}
{"text":"I found it expensive for what it was.  Very old school.  I started with the escargots - which were tasty, if a little salty and rubbery.  I was then brought a mixed green salad, which consisted mainly of iceberg lettuce (which was a bit rusty). I ordered a filet mignon for my main, although it looked as though it was cooked perfectly (medium rare) strangely it was rather dry and at least one other dining companion had the same complaint. Could it be that the meat had been frozen and defrosted rendering it bloodless? The accompanying rice was so dry and tasteless it would be better served coming out of a Gatling gun, absolutely dreadful. The sorbet in between courses was ok if that's your thing and the pickles were rockin'. I ordered a Brazilian coffee to finish as I heard that they put on quite a show. They roll up in some rickety old cart and heat the glass etc etc, not very impressive honestly.  The service was ok. Our server was kind of grumpy at first and then got friendly as the night went on. One of the servers looked really anorexic. The horrible uniform they make them wear was hanging off her skeletal frame. Not who'd you'd expect to be serving your food - you have to wonder what she's doing on her break? I'm sure I'm forgetting something but that speaks for itself.  Overall I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's dated and a tourist trap."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Everything we ate was fantastic. Steak was great. Still think about the escargot. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decor : Very rustic and home-like decor. 

Food : a little pricey, but very good and worth it. Everything is well seasoned and well cooked. 

Service : The staff is very dedicated (considering they all own shares of the business) and very knowledgeable. 

I'm a person who likes experience above all and this place will offer that. You can go there with a significant other or a larger group of friends and still have a great time.
 
* i prefer this location to the st-sauveur one."}
{"text":"Must be the best steakhouse in the MTL.  Been here three times.  They cover all the cuts of beef and have lots of seafood as well.  The sides are classic with original touches added in.  Very good wine list and friendly service.  Mrs G and I agreed that the server was one of the best we have on memory.

It is located in the olde city and the ambience is olde style steakhouse.  If a martini (gin and tonic, scotch and water, etc) followed by shellfish, salad, and steak appeals to you, this is a good haunt."}
{"text":"Its been a few years since i visited Canada but this was one amazing restaurant. The steak was out of this world. I mean who really can cook a well done porterhouse without making it a tough piece of meat...Gibbys can. 
Service was top shelf and the mood was lite. 
When you find time and the money GO."}
{"text":"Everything was really good but not super killer. Maybe I expect too much for a bill that is a over a Hundo per person. The food overall was fresh, cooked properly, tasted good. I just feel I've eaten at better steakhouses and the word on the block was I wouldn't be able to find better. None the less the Gibby cut steak was good and cooked perfectly med but had my friends beef Wellington and it was AMAZING!  Oysters, asparagus, twice baked potatoe were good but not great.

Service was great, food was just above average, but nothing impressive..."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse with large portions which are perfect to share. The building is beautiful with large historic charm and wood beams everywhere. My husband and I split the filet steak, Monte Carlo potato and a salad. It was a perfect size for two people. Looks like a place that also serves large parties quickly so would be perfect for a family,bachelor/Bachelorette party,etc. Defintely coming back next time we are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant to visit in Montreal when you're a tourist with exchange-rate friendly money to burn. I ate here a few times before I became a vegetarian, and I'd probably go back now that I'm a big meat-eating cheater, because the steaks are excellent, as is the ambiance. It's in a historic building, which the designers incorporated into the restaurant, so it has that old world charm you came to Montreal for in the first place. If you're a local and you're reading this, you probably prefer going elsewhere. Please email me a list of your favorites, because I love your city.

Gibby's, I gather, is something of an institution which means something of a tourist trap, but it's not an overrated, Times Square-esque tourist trap, so I'd say it's worth a visit before you move on to whatever secret hole in the wall your French-speaking cousin wants to drag you to instead."}
{"text":"On a 3-1/2 week vacation through Canada, this was THE BEST MEAL of the entire trip.

My meat was perfect, my potato was perfect, my \"adult beverage\" was perfect.

I don't know what else to say.  If you enjoy it, if it's delicious, it's a great meal.  Remember, I was on a cruise ship for 3 weeks, famous for good food, and THIS was my favorite meal."}
{"text":"Service was great. The steak was overdone slightly from medium rare, which made it really tough and dry.
Otherwise the Monte Carlo potatoes was great. As was everything else besides the steaks."}
{"text":"Best damn meal in Montreal. Their menu is a little pricey, but the meal is worth it. You will not walk away from here with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Prima restaurant. Aanbevolen door onze huurbaas en gelijk uitgeprobeerd!
Niet het goedkoopste maar zeker waar voor je geld. 
Zal een goede herinnering aan mij steak overhouden. Heerlijk!

Kom zeker bij een volgende gelegenheid terug."}
{"text":"My steak was cooked to perfection!  Gibby's never fails to disappoint. The last time i was there i shared the Oysters Rockefeller which were really tasty. I ordered the filet mignon which was a good size and perfectly medium rare. The service was really good and the decor made me feel like I was in a nice cabin enjoying a great steak with friends. I don't mind paying the price for a meal this good. I left so full really had no room for dessert at all. Yes it was expensive but sometimes its nice to treat yourself. Major plus is this place is in old Montreal, probably one of the nicest parts of the city with a lot of tourists and close to the water."}
{"text":"Bread...lots and lots of warm delicious Gibby's bread. Gibby's is a Montreal institution. The atmosphere is incredibly unique as the restaurant is in a 200+ year old stone building in old Montreal. It's great bang for the buck, your meal comes with amazing bread, pickles, coleslaw, the signature Gibby's salad and yummy mint chocolates at the end. The steaks are very good and they have an amazing Clam Chowder. The ambiance is a bit dark and the restaurant is huge so there's always room but it never hurts to make a reservation especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"I have entertained business guests at Gibby's thrice and I find this an excellent choice. The place has an old-world charm. And considering what a nightmare parking in downtown Montreal is, the valet parking is a blessing. 
Ambience inside is pleasant. Tables are not packed too tightly, and so it didn't feel cluttered, and is conducive for conversation. Service staff were attentive and cheerful. 
As for food, the steak is outstanding - with a smoky flavour and cooked to perfection. However I have to say that I find the portions too large. My wife chose the petit filet mignon and it turned out to be a better size. The Provence prawns served with garlic butter was equally outstanding. So was the lobster tails. 
The desserts are also of huge portions each. The chocolate cake was memorable even though none of us could finish it. The coffee flambé (Spanish, Irish or Brazil) were wonderful - \"performed\" (mixed and flambé) there and then by the servers. A dramatic end to top the evening. 
Price of food and wine is on the high side for casual dining. In our case, inclusive of 2 bottles of wine our bill worked our to $100 per person. 
I would still come back for the special occasions."}
{"text":"This place is a classic. It has a cosy old Montreal ambience, very good service, valet parking, a fairly varied menu and prices to match its classic style.  The food is good and portions are generous."}
{"text":"Wow... what a great, friendly restaurant. We hosted a customer dinner for 45 people. The staff was amazing. Took care of everyone and were beyond friendly. The food was delicious, large portions, well cooked steaks. I had the fish and it was yummy. Highly recommend, especially for larger parties."}
{"text":"I started with the French onion soup which was excellent.  it is by far my favorite soup,  and they do a great job with it.  The ribeye was awesome and so was the twice baked potatoe. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great steak place!
I ordered the snails to start. Fantastic! Not too creamy but had a great flavour!
The. I had the rib steak with salad and Monte Carlo potato. 
The steak was so big! It can be easily shared by two people. I got it medium rare. And it was fantastic! Its seasoning was perfect and the steak itself was juicy and tender. 
The potato was awesome too, must try!
We got the cream puff thing for dessert, it was a nice ending to our meal. 
I also have to mention their excellent service. There was a small portion of lemon sorbet serviced after the appetizer to cleanse your taste buds and get you ready for your main course. And there was a bowl of water served after the main course for you to clean your hands. Sweet!
Anyway, we had a great experience at Gibbys."}
{"text":"A friend told me this place was fantastic and worth the money. Not at all worth it. Cocktails are 12 dollars a piece.  Very crowded and LOUD! We couldnt have a conversation it was so loud. Food was very bland needed tons of salt and pepper. Beef wellington looked so good. Cut like butter, cooked perfectly medium rare and it was like eating tofu. Completly tasteless. Will not go again or recommend. Much better places here for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"I'd say three stars overall, two if you give much weight to the price. On the plus side, it's in a beautiful building and has a great vibe, and the valet parking is a life-saver for anyone (like us) dumb enough to drive into this neighborhood thinking they'll save time. 

On the minus side, the food ranges from decent, neighborhood restaurant-quality (the steaks and fish) to standard diner-level (the salad and appetizers), to supermarket-level (the bread).  

We were treated to some surreal comedy by a deadpan waitress determined to hard-sell the salad:

\"Are you sure you want the gazpacho? We're famous for our salad.\"
\"That sounds nice, but I'm really in the mood for some gazpacho.\"
\"We're FAMOUS for our salad.\"
\"Yeah, I don't know ...\"
\"And our dressing. You've never had anything like it. We're FAMOUS for our SALAD.\"

So almost everyone ordered the salad, which turned out to be a big bowl of iceberg lettuce, big wedges of half-flavorful tomatoes, and what tasted an awful lot like Newman's Own Italian dressing. It felt a bit like a Seinfeld episode. 

I was the only one at our table who took a chance on the gazpacho, which, while better than the salad, didn't distinguish itself in any way. It was under-seasoned (it hit the spot after an addition of pepper and the bacon bits they give you to tart up the bread)

The arctic char I had was competently cooked, on the conservative / flaky end of the spectrum, and well seasoned. The ribeye steak I sampled was good quality and perfectly cooked medium-rare, with very little temperature gradient. It didn't taste like it had been dry aged or that it was any special provenance. It would have been an impressive steak at a lower price, but I hope for a little more when the price goes north of $50. 

We had a great time here, but I doubt I'll go back on future Montreal trips. I suspect the city has much better offerings. Gibby's reminds me of many New York City restaurants that have been around forever, and are now mostly famous for being famous. As such they mostly attract tourists (like us) who haven't done enough research."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I found this place overpriced for the quality of the food I had. There are better steak places that aren't tourist traps!"}
{"text":"I like this place , the steak  and lobster are good And I love the deserts also the staff were nice and I love the interior design ! Good place for a romantic dinner for two but  just remember for the price U are paying U would definitely expect more than that but its okay it worth a try at least once"}
{"text":"Prior to coming, I read reviews about this place but I was very disappointed leaving here. First, we made a reservation for 2 couples to not be seated with each other and they ended up seating us with each other. 

Pros:
- Decor: I loved the entry to the restaurant. Very cute to take pictures of with your friends or significant other. It has a very rustic vibe to the restaurant. 

Cons: 
- Food: Our clam chowder was not very good. The clams were not fresh and had a different taste to them. We also got the Filet Mignon of Beef Wellington and the beef did not taste so great either. My partner got the Lobster Tails and they did also not taste fresh. 
- Price: For the quality of food I got and the weight of the price, my partner and I were not to happy. 
- Parking: You will probably have to pay for valet here. Unless you leave early and can find parking in the area. Unfortunately, we are from Toronto and did not know the area well. 

Overall, I do not think I will be coming back. As nice as the restaurant is, I was fairly disappointed with the quality of food we, had for the price we paid."}
{"text":"10 stars out of 5!!! Oh my God is this place incredible! My husband and I were in Montreal a few weeks ago for a couple hockey games and we are lucky to have found this gem.  We wanted a delicious steak dinner and we got one. Gibby's has such a great steakhouse feel, the ambiance is perfect and their food is out of this world- even the bread and butter was amazing! We started with shrimp cocktail and the salads that came with dinner- both delicious. I ordered the Filet Mignon and added the Canadian Lobster Tail- absolutely incredible, the best best steak and lobster I have ever had.  My husband felt the same about his dish, he ordered the sirloin steak and loved it.  The waiter was great and service was amazing. This meal and experience was everything and more. We were so thrilled that we found the perfect steakhouse in Old Montreal- will definitely go back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Gibbys is an old time classic steak house that is definitely one of the best in downtown Montreal and in my mind could be the best consistent restaurant in the old port.  You enter this place and it has a rustic charm feel to it that is both warm and cozy. Like being in an old lodge or tavern. Word has it that is used to be the stables for the horses way way back! 

Onto the menu. There are so many different cuts of beef that even the most difficult curmudgeon will find something to his or her liking. They excel with their peppercorn or mustard sauces on steak. Also there is an excellent selection of fish (salmon, tuna, swordfish, Arctic char) just to name a few. Shrimp and lobster of course. Really a super duper menu! 

On this fine evening I had selected the curry shrimp. I know this is a steakhouse but eating a big morsel of steak at 8:00 pm = a bad nights sleep for me! The curry shrimp came out on a very generous serving on rice with pampadams and asparagus. I found the curry sauce a bit gooey but it had a decent spice and was flavourful and fragrant. One the less! Portion size here is \"unbuckle the pants\" a bit big! 

We had 18 people in our group and it was one of the best group dinners we've had together! Everyone had a blast!"}
{"text":"Our overall experience at Gibbys was good, but over priced.  Orders at our table included the ribeye, the New York strip, and Beef Wellington. All the dishes were in the $50+ range, and while good, did not seem worth the price. What was excellent was the service; our waiter took very good care of us."}
{"text":"I'm planning on another trip to Montreal for the upcoming holiday  and a visIt must include a return to this old school Vieux Monttreal iconic landmark.

A great location, Vieux (old) Montreal takes you to another world and centuries away even though you are only 90 miles from Burlington VT

But let's get back to the food...their steak done perfectly( Rib Eye is a favorite)  ample bread and as I recall fantastic pickles...and all reasonably priced.  We started with a Gibby's house salad and frankly the portions were so ample that  sides were superfluous. They are also known for  seafood if red meat isn't your thing.

The ambience is old school steak house. A bit rustic..The wait staff attentive  and friendly.  In the heart of the most beautiful section of the city.

Full bar...great old school cocktails...a nice wine list.. And the bill with tip was less than you'd expect...certainly the best value for your Canadian Dollar.

I recommend a reservation...and get there early...have a drink upstairs while you wait.

I suggest stay right in Vieux Montreal ... And become a Francophile ...

Vous Aimerez Gibbys!"}
{"text":"A quaint building houses one of Canada's best steak houses. Rural old-world charm. Wooden tables, comfortable plush chairs and dimly-lit dining areas give this restaurant a romantic feel.

Reservations weren't difficult to get on a Sunday night when called in the day before, although we were told to come at 8-ish. We were seated promptly when we arrived at 8pm.

The server brought fresh bread, jumbo pickles and a ramekin of bacon crumbles to the table when we sat down. Pickles seems to be a Montreal tradition, but I've never seen bacon served with bread before, but when in Rome! It did add an extra dimension to the bread though.

Appetizers consisted of escargot bourguignonne and mussels provencale. The escargot was excellent, very tender, prepared in the traditional way with garlic, shallots and white wine; served out of the shell in the usual escargot dish. The mussels were baked instead of the more familiar steamed, with tomatoes, herbs and garlic and more bacon!

All entrees include a choice of Gibby's salad or gazpacho and are served with a starch choice of baked potato, Monte Carlo potato or rice pilaf. The Monte Carlo potato is similar to a twice-baked potato with cheese and chives. Asparagus was also included.

We ordered the filet and the petit filet. The regular filet was massive. I would guess a good 14-16 ounces. The petite had to be at least 10. They are on the expensive side, but given the size and the included salad, starch and vegetable it worked out to be good value for money. The steaks were tender and cooked to the correct temperature and the Montreal style seasoning (pepper, onion, garlic) made them delicious.

We rounded off the meal with a shared triple chocolate dessert, which was delightful. We passed on the offer of table-side flaming coffees ($14ea), but the table next to us did order, so we got to see the show.

Service was good, but the server would often disappear for extended periods of time between courses. The tobacco smell emanating from her clothing told us where she had been...."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. 

Had Christmas dinner here. Everything we tried was well prepared and delicious. The beef wellington and snail starter were standout dishes."}
{"text":"Everything super salty, to the point where it's unbearable to eat. The staff are nice but nothing beyond. The two waitresses kept chatting and starring at us the whole night, a bit uncomfortable I would say. Not the place I would dream to come back to. Nice and cosy atmosphere though."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in Montreal hands down. I got a medium rare filet mignon steak it was amazing! Tbh you don't need to order anything else besides a main dish! They give so much extra food besides the main! I had a house salad which was amazing with they're croutons. They also serve amazing bread with this cottage cheese dip and amazing pickles reminded me of Home!  With the steak I ordered the mashed potatoes it was so creamy and good .My boyfriend had a steak with a bone and it was the best marbleized steak with so much flavor pouring out of it. I really recommend gibbys for any occasion. They're vibe and food is over the top!!!!"}
{"text":"Gibby's makes me LOVE the meat! My husband likes coming here, and on his latest business trip I had a chance to join him. The restaurant is located in the Old Port of Montreal, and the historic building is about 200 years old. Once inside you feel you've been transported to a different era. Anything you order is of the highest quality, including the desserts; and although the prices are high, you are paying for what you get: an overall excellent experience."}
{"text":"This place is as quaint as it's food is delicious. It is very cozy and the tables are plentiful but to stacked on top of one another.  

Our server was peasant and efficient. The food was stupendous starting with a eel made bourbon old fashioned.  The gazpacho has a nice balanced and fresh flavor.  The sod was crisp, cold and topped with a flavorful garlic vinaigrette. The filet was perfectly cooked to medium. The baked potato was just the right combo of flavors to set it apart from a regular baked.  

The chocolate dessert was a slice of sinful richness. 

Such an awesome spot to try while visiting this awesome city."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were walking around the old port and we craved for steak. We had a friend who recommended this place to us. When we got seated we were served bread, a bowl of pickles and some bacon bits and butter. The bread was amazing! I even asked them for another one. We ordered the crab cakes and oysters to start. Both plates were really delicious. It's probably the best crab cakes I've had. Oysters were also very fresh and not fishy tasting. For our main, my boyfriend had the steak with the bone in it and I had the teriyaki steak. Each of our mains we got to chose a side, he chose a potato and I got the rice. The mains were also served with a salad and soup. My teriyaki steak was delicious, perfectly seasoned and went really well with the rice. My boyfriends steak was cooked to perfection medium rare and also deliciously seasoned. He also got a side order of the mushroom steak sauce which was delicious. The soup and salad that our mains came with we weren't a big fan of. It was a cold soup which was not to my taste and the salad I found was a bit bland but those are given to any mains. I liked how they served us lemon sorbet in between appetizers and main meal to get rid of the taste and also customized Gibby mint chocolate slices at the end of our meal. The service was excellent and we were well looked after, they always checked to make sure we had everything we needed as well as bring out our mains on time after we had finish our appetizers. The next time I  go, I am looking forward to trying their clam chowder soup and I will be ordering my teriyaki steak again. For dessert we shared the creme Brule. It was delicious and creamy, only complaint is we wish they had burned the sugar more as it wasn't burned enough which was lacking. The sugar on top of the creme brule was barely burnt and it was almost as if it wasn't burned at all.. but This restaurant is delicious and deserves a lot more than 5 stars. The bill for 2 of us was around $250. We got 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 1 dessert."}
{"text":"This is a classic steakhouse in old Montreal. I'd not been to Montreal in bout 5 years. The weather was miserable (cold, rain/snow mix) & the parking was difficult but we endured!! I had a 6oz Petite Filet. The reason I gave them a 5* is because they nailed the steak!! It was done precisely the way I wanted it cooked. The Monte Carlo potato which was indescribable delicious. One more thing....the giant garlic dills are wicked. So thick..almost a meal in itself."}
{"text":"Waiter Jan smoothed the way through Gibby's offerings - a succulent black cod for me and the rare (spot on) and tender ribeye for my wife Jan (no relation - smile) - wines were finely paired thanks to Jan's counsel and delight was elegantly achieved."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here for my friends Bachelor Party. Arrived with a big group and was treated to excellent food at great price! Our waiters, Tammy and M-Claude, were awesome and super accommodative to our large group"}
{"text":"I went to Gibbys on a Thursday night. This was my first time there, I had read great reviews about the place and with the price I was expecting amazing steak. Unfortunately, i was slightly disappointed. Honestly, almost everything was great. Nice ambiance, free valet, staff was attentive and outstanding  with there service. They start you off with in house bread (very tasty) pickles. When you order a main plate, salad and potatoes come with it. Salad was very good, nice light dressing, Monte Carlo baked potato was out of this world. The ribeye was very delicious however my beef wellington was not that great. 

I was watching master chef and Gordon Ramsey was showing how to make beef wellington and it looked so good. So I searched Montreal restaurants and found that Gibbys had this item on their menu. But I was let down, first I had asked for Medium cook but the brought Medium rare. I asked them to cook it more. Once they brought it back, the meat was not seasoned at all and was kinda tough. I did not enjoyed it at all.

I am still giving it a 4 star as everything else was excellent. But I do not recommend the beef wellington"}
{"text":"Great food and service at this Montreal treasure! Located in old Montreal, this spot had a vast menu and provides a great dining experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. I came here with my husband to celebrate his birthday while in Montreal, based on a colleague's recommendation. I loved everything about this place! The ambience is very nice and romantic. Looks kind of cave like inside. The servers and hosts were very friendly. To start, they give you a fresh loaf of bread with butter and pickles. Yum! Our entrees came with a salad which was delicious as well. We ordered the filet mignon and rib steak. Both were accompanied by Monte Carlo (which is a baked potato twice baked with bacon, sour cream, and chives) and asparagus. I was soooo full before the entree but HAD to finish the Monte Carlo because it was Soo good. I would totally recommend anyone in Montreal to come here for a good steak dinner! Free valet parking too!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for 7 days and ate here 2 of them - that's how good it is.  It reminds me of an old style chop house with wait staff in formal looking clothing, tableside preparation and a big menu. Service was good although a little slow at times but it's a huge place and the staff were doing all they could.  One nice thing is that there isn't a \"it's not my table\" philosophy - if a staff member is near you they will check in to see if you need anything.  We didn't pack dressy clothing and felt perfectly comfortable in slacks and nice shirts.

 I've read some of the negative reviews on here and my response to them is check out the menu before you go.  If they serve something you like you will be very pleased, if it's not what you're looking for, go somewhere else but don't blame it on the restaurant."}
{"text":"En famille super bon, huîtres, moules puis filet buf et homard excellente expérience. 
Service ok et agréable."}
{"text":"Wow! If you are ready to spend a little extra on a good dinner, go to Gibby's. House made pickles had my girlfriend almost full before we even started on dinner and the pretzel roll had me smiling. We ordered drinks, wine for her and a cocktail for me. Both were pleasing and mine was particularly strong. Dinner was Filet Mignon Wellington for me and I don't think it could have been better. A light flaky crust quickly have way to an expertly prepared steak. My girlfriend ordered the rib eye and it was just slightly over done (we still enjoyed about 80% of it). Dessert was perhaps the best I have ever had. Crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with blueberries and raspberries had me full to bursting! The experience was capped with mints and was $20 less than we planned for. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Out of the nice steakhouse's that I've been to in Montreal, this is the best in my opinion.

Moishe's is expensive, but it has no atmosphere and the steak is unacceptably inconsistent for the price.  Gibby's has a great atmosphere, with a full restaurant that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside with the low ceilings .

The food is consistent and worth the bigger price tag.  Servers are friendly and attentive, fulfilling the expectations that you usually bring to a place like this.

They also have great seafood options if you're not in the mood for beef (or lamb, etc.)."}
{"text":"Good, traditional steak house... Good choice for a business meeting, but there are better choices for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Our visit to Gibby's last evening was simply mahvelous!  After a few opening cocktails, I had Gibby's salad along with a veal chop and the Monte Carlo potato. Ended the meal with Key Lime pie. The setting was cozy, the service was great and the food was delicious. Wonderful steakhouse."}
{"text":"Wow! Simply the best steakhouse I've been to in a while. The rack of lamb was perfectly cooked and my appetizer was fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent service but it could be that we got lucky with the waiter who was sooooo wonderful!!  We only came here based on the very good overall reviews but to be honest, my steak was eh.  I've had the top of the top steaks before so I know these cuts weren't that good.  I mean, it wasn't altogether terrible but i did expect better. 
We ordered the rib eye and Gibby's cut.  

I am giving a high rating because our waiter was fantastic to us.  The wine was excellent.  I enjoyed the sorbet.  At the end, our waiter gave us dark chocolate that we all liked.  

The place had a lot of tourists, which is nice.  The decor was rustic.  The waitstaff in the front was a little stoic to me... meaning, there wasn't a welcoming greeting nor even an attempt to be welcoming.  Weird huh?  Like I said, the best part was that our waiter was sincere and really nice.  Forgot his name but our table was all the way in the back.. so maybe you can ask for that area for seating? hehe.

One of the most recommended sides was the monte carlo loaded baked potato. that can be shared.  I also had the escargot, YUM!  

Reservations must be made in advance."}
{"text":"We reserved a table here for my birthday, unfortunately I cannot review the food as we did not stay to eat, the restaurant was busy, so we went upstairs to the bar to wait for our table, the wait staff in the bar pretty much ignored us, eventually we were served, our drinks order was wrong twice, so third time lucky, every other table was given snacks, not us, not that we wanted to spoil our appetite, but to be offered rather than ignored, would have been nice, after 45 mins, no updates, many other arriving later being seated first, we paid for our drinks and left. Never again, they trade on a name made 25+ years ago, along with the decor, which has never been updated or cleaned since opening."}
{"text":"Great meal! We were told by everyone we asked to try Gibby's. They were all right. Food was wonderful as was the service. A definite must if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"I took this recommendation from a local patron at La Casa de Habano, and glad I did. 

The huge stone building appears to have been a stable, or at least it has a courtyard for carriages.

Try the Beef Wellington. It is excellent, tender and the mushroom sauce is the bomb. It's enough for two if you are having salad and dessert. 

Get a reservation. This place stays busy all the time. It's a Montreal favorite for dinner and celebrations!"}
{"text":"Our favorite steakhouse on the planet! We make the  drive from Long Island every year, and while our list of restaurants to hit changes, Gibbys is always a staple.  It sounds funny but their pickles are damn good and served at every table with butter and bacon bits.  We got the grab cake appetizer and it was great! Had an aioli sauce with it.  The steak is just unbelievable.  I got the filet medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  The atmosphere is really cool too.  Can't wait to go again next year."}
{"text":"The place was nice, cozy.. and busy! Service was great and the food came excellent. the portions were very good, as I still had room for desserts. Overall nice environment"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food, really great service. Trip to Montreal is not complete without Gibby's. Their potions are generous and it was worth every penny! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Over the top quality, great service. 
This is a must in old Montreal. It is old but what great ambiance.
The calm chowder is a must, one of the best you will ever have. Beef Wellington is fantastic, my wife had the halibut and it was perfect as well.
In Montreal do not pass up Gibbys"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is consistent, the service is amazing.  You can dress up or go casual, and there's no judgement.  yes it is a little pricey, but it is a steakhouse in old port montreal; at least you get great food,and a lot of it ( we always have leftovers or order 2 appetizers and 1 main if we are two;for example)"}
{"text":"We decided to come here after reading all of the reviews and wanting to go somewhere very good for our last night in Montreal. 

From the outside the building looks quiet and small, but once we walked in we were surprised to see that it was not only full, but a very large restaurant. The dining room has a homey feel to it, like it's a popular local mom-and-pop place. 

The service was excellent and we really enjoyed the complementary bread, butter, bacon pieces, and pickles. The pickles were especially good - very vinegary and salty. Drinks were also great, and so was the French onion soup, although it was sweeter than I like. Portion sizes are huge here, so don't get carried away like we did. I thought the salad that came with dinner would be a normal side salad size, but it was huge - almost a meal in itself. The steak was great and cooked perfectly, and the swordfish came with a Cajun seasoning that was pretty spicy and good.

We didn't have any room for dessert and left very happy (and with leftovers). While paying the bill I talked to the waitress and she explained that almost everything is made in-house, including desserts, pickles, and bread.

Definitely worth a stop, especially if you're very hungry."}
{"text":"My goodness. Great service and the food was great as well. I had the chicken which was stuffed with butter and onions. They started us with salads then a little sherbet to cleanse the pallet. The entire came then the dessert. Cheese cake was heavenly."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of four hungry gentlemen. We left full and happy. The service was what you'd expect from a good old-school steakhouse: knowledgeable, but not warm and fuzzy, and that's fine. 

I ordered the Gibby Cut and added some shrimp to make it a surf and turf. It was amazing, and the local seasoning they added made it even better. The sides were good as well.

As for the decor, it can be best described as a mix between an old tavern and an old lodge. 

This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Great place!  Awesome atmosphere.  Had the attic chard it was fantastic!  Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"My hotel concierge recommended this restaurant, and it was late already so I didn't do too much investigating into it before I just sat down at a table. It's a very cozy, rustic Montreal steakhouse. The service was very good. The menu had mostly steak and fish options for entrees. Escargot and onion soup were good. Dinner was also good, just not fantastic. I felt it was over priced. I prefer trendier, more creative menus, so I think this place just wasn't for me as a tourist."}
{"text":"Don't get what the hype is about.  First time there for me.  The place just has an old fashioned feel to it (not in a good way), the waitresses' uniforms are ridiculous (what's with the frills?) and the prices are outrageous.  Is the food good, it's a steak.. and it's cooked the way you ask for it to be cooked.  Is this something outstanding?  No- it's a steak restaurant - it's what I would expect.  There is really nothing exceptional about this place, and the prices are high.  Was it good, yes, was it great... it was steak...  would I go back?  Definitely no."}
{"text":"Gibby's deserves all the five-star ratings it gets on Yelp. It really is the perfect place for any special occasion. I went to Gibby's a couple months back to celebrate my birthday. Although it's a little more upscale, the staff is still welcoming and friendly. It's nice to be in a place where it seems like most guests are enjoying a special night out. 

1. Bread & pickles - The bread is amazingly soft and warm. The pickles are little too salty and (dare I say) I might prefer the ones at Moishe's. 

2. Oysters - Deliiiicious. Very fresh and a fresh start to a steak dinner. 

*Citrus sorbet as palette cleanser

3. Filet mignon with baked potato - Very tender and meaty. Cooked to our expectation 

4. Beef wellington with Monte Carlo potato - The pastry was flaky and the beef was extraordinarily tender. Really nice mushroom sauce. The potato was so creamy and satisfying. Ended up taking half of the portion home and it still tasted delicious the next day. 

No room for dessert but will have to go back another time!"}
{"text":"Gibby's should definitely be on your list if you're a meat lover. And if you're looking for a full-blown meat experience, you won't leave disappointed, as the menu offers a wide range of steaks, cuts, and even more finest dishes such as fish, chicken, seafood, etc.

Gibby's is stacked in a 200-year-old building, which gives to the restaurant all its charm and ambiance. Magnificent and stunning. 

I had nature oysters as the appetizer. They were absolutely delectable. These were followed by the Gibby's salad and the Petite filet mignon, very rare AKA blue. One word to remember here : tender. 

To top it off, I added to the whole experience the Gibby's layered chocolate cake. Dinner couldn't have been better without it. Simply delicious and special. 

Only thing that could be improved is their wine list. Since I'm a wine lover, I love to pair good and funky wine to my delicious dish. Sad that their \"exhaustive wine list\" isn't that exhaustive. I wish they could add more private importation bottles and also by the glass.

Service was lovely, professional and fast. The waitress gave me nice recommendations."}
{"text":"By far the worst restaurant we have been to, we travel a lot and visit many restaurants, but this takes the trophy of worst steak, and service. 
We ordered 3 steaks and some shrimp and a bottle of wine. 
The steaks were over cooked the first time so we didn't get to taste them. Then they came back and they tasted like low quality oily steak. The shrimp tasted like one big garlic, the server was no where to be found so we had to get up and find croutons, napkin, and silver ware. 
Oh and to top off our night they spilled steak bloody sauce all over our white $4000 leather jacket and shirt.
The nastiest restaurant, and worst steak in our life! They said they would clean the jacket; but they didn't follow through, and even then white leather doesn't clean that  well when the stain is blood and steak sauce!!!"}
{"text":"These boys know how to grill a steak - perfect temp on the inside and seared to carmelized perfection on the outside. And I take my steaks rare thank you very much. The boneless rib eye was off-the-charts mouthwatering good; almost melting in the mouth. And what a service team; everyone pitched in to help regardless of what needed to be done. All of our orders arrived at precisely the right moments - just enough time to fully savor the previous course before the next arrived. Dining out has been elevated to an art form and that form is Gibby's."}
{"text":"Brilliant steak house...brilliant service..great pickles and bread to start!!!! Love old Montreal and this place is not to be missed...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Spent a week in Montreal and luckily found this place.  Best salad, yellowfin tuna, twice baked potato and ambience I experienced by a long shot in the city."}
{"text":"Went here for business meal in mid December and the place was packed.  We were able to get a table for 6 but quarters were tight.  There were some very energetic and interesting waiters & waitresses but, ours was soft spoken but attentive.  

Gibby's is in a 200 year old building with a rich history ... tall people need to be very careful. The historic building and old world charm of the restaurant really makes you feel like you're in a different time.  But, the menu prices brought me right back to 2015 (a strong US dollar helped make it reasonable).  

The food lives up to the reputation as a high end chop house.  We all had steaks of some kind and everyone enjoyed.  Starting with the fresh baked bread that keeps getting replace with a full loaf and the famous Gibby's salad - which comes with anchovies and is similar Caesar.  Both were delicious.  

I had the Beef Wellington rare.  My first time trying this dish and it was terrific.  They use a filet cut that was so fresh, it actually came across as almost tasteless.  The mushroom & pastry coating were great. But, the mushroom gravy was amazing.  If it was appropriate, I would have drank some straight from the gravy boat.  

Bottom line is that Gibby's is a high end restaurant in a historic part of old Montreal.  It's a fancy place and you pay \"fancy prices.\"  But, the food is very good & worth the money. And, the atmosphere is worth a visit for a special occasion"}
{"text":"We traveled from Dallas to visit Montreal and chose Gibby's for my husband's birthday dinner. I don't think we could chosen a more perfect place. 

The service, from everyone was incredible. I even messed up our reservation time, and the team worked us in quickly and with a smile. 

And if the service was a 10 out of 10, the food was a 15 out of 10! Everything from appetizer to dessert: perfection. 

I highly recommend a visit for all ages!"}
{"text":"While I'm not the biggest fan of steak I love some good seafood so when the chance arose to go to Gibby's I said why not.  Situated in Old Montreal the restaurant is housed in an old stable and offers a warm and cozy ambiance.  It also has complimentary valet parking which is good to note since parking in the area can be next to impossible sometimes. 

The portions here are HUGE so I opted to skip the appetizer.  Besides you also get a starter included with your meal (salad, tomatoes and onions or tomato gazpacho).  I opted for the gazpacho which despite being tomato based was loaded with lots of other vegetables such as green peppers which really upped the flavour of the dish.  Be warned though that there is lots of garlic in the gazpacho so it is not the best choice if you're there for date night!

I opted to have the lobster tails as my main with a Monte Carlo potato on the side.  The Monte Carlo is a baked potato with sour cream, bacon and chives and it is definitely a cut above a normal baked potato.  The lobster just fell apart and when dipped in butter was like a little taste of heaven.

I finished off with blueberry cheesecake for dessert and the texture was just right.  Also it didn't taste too rich.  The waiter also brought mint chocolates at this point too which was a nice way to finish off a good meal.

The service was pretty good except for a couple of minor errors where they brought us the wrong items.  That being said they did correct the mistake quickly.  In the end it was a good meal but given the prices here it's the kind of place where you come to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"First time visitor.  Just arrived to montreal with my wife from toronto.  We've been looking forward to the food here for quite some time.  

We were incredibly impressed with everything tonight.  

The atmosphere is excellent.  The portions are generous and more importantly tasty.  We really appreciated the mid meal lemon sorbet to cleanse the pallet and the minty dark chocolate at the end of the meal. 

The steak was a bit on the garlicky side but we agreed to the extra topping.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes. Lots of children and grandparents, people in very casual wear. Hotel made the reservation, yet we were still seated next to a bussing station. Good for tourists and families with small children, but if you are two adults wanting a nice meal, check Yelp for other suggestions."}
{"text":"Always great. Been coming here for years and they've always been perfect. The service is professional. The food is exquisite and fresh. Their homemade bread, pickles and bacon are wonderful starters. This time I had the NY sirloin and it was perfectly cooked. Will continue making it my favorite steakhouse."}
{"text":"Gibby's est une institution et la qualité ne bronche pas. Tout est bon! La qualité des produits est incontestable. Je craque pour: la soupe à l'oignon, sûrement la meilleure que je n'aie mangée; le carré d'agneau; les fruits de mer; les pommes de terre Monte Carlo et le profiterole! Rien à dire de plus. J'adoooore!!!"}
{"text":"Great location . . . former stable in Old Montreal.  Lone Star food for Morton's  prices.  Diner-level service.  No visible management.  They scrape the dirty dishes in the dining room . . . where they serve $50 steaks, really?  Popular tourist restaurant, but overstated.  Average restaurant in a great restaurant city."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but service was really bad. Wanted to have a nice dinner for my bf's bday. We waited in the lounge for 30 mins, they never came to see us to serve us drinks. There's no bar to go up to order, there was only 2 waiters and they are walking by so fast not even looking. We order, at this point it's been an hour and we are hungry, brings bread no butter for another 15 mins. Wont go again, possibly bad timing, but for the amount I paid, i expected at least service while i was waiting in the lounge."}
{"text":"Very very nice in every way. Recommended to us by a former resident of Montreal, and glad she did. Met friends for dinner and both the food and the service was spot on. The ceilings are very low but somehow it doesn't detract from the ambiance. No hesitation on the 5 star rating."}
{"text":"In the heart of Old Montreal, off Rue Youville. Previous 18th Century Stable house. Three floors with a mix of modern/contemporary decor. Wood on inside with big fireplace. Stonewalls covered with beautiful vines on the outside. Patio closed today due to down pour of rain. Quite the fine dining experience! Service was on par with knowledgeable staff. Bathrooms located on top floor where there is a lounge or the bottom floor where there is rooms for lager group events. Knowing for their Rib-eye and strake- also has a seafood option. We started off with Fresh baked bread with creamy butter and large dill pickle. Your choice of wine or cocktail. Next can the Appetizers and ended up getting the regular green salad and others tomato /onion. Portions were not small- so pace yourself and be prepared to eat. I got the Steak of Dianne with an amazing gravy glaze that cannot be explained with worlds. Meat was cooked to preference. Came with rice/ veggies and lobster tail. Others ordered 1/2lb of lobster which looked and tasted like it came fresh from the sea that day! They gave us lemon glacé to cleanse our palate between meals and then when we thought it could be enough- there was dessert. Known for their chocolate moist cake and featured key lime pie. Choice of coffee or after dinner drinks. We were so full - we had to sit for a bit longer in which staff did not mind they were quite friendly and entertaining. One ordered the chocolate bourbon latte and there's was a cool \"fireshow\" to go with it. Our waiter did not disappoint. Can buy local sauces and dill pickle in jars of u so choose. Good thing about location- you could and would have to walk back to digest all that's eaten! They do have taxis that can drop off and have valet parking."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but last week I went two nights in a row. Thursday I went with my colleagues. I started with the Gibby's salad, the rib eye steak and the Monte Carlo potato followed by the blueberry cheesecake. The steak was ok but the cheesecake was very good! It's not too sweet and it's pretty big and filling!

On Friday, one friend n I had the beef wellington with the Monte Carlo potato. The first time I had it, it blew my mind!! The pastry was crispy and the inside was nice and tender! It was perfection! Since then it honestly hasn't been as good at it was the first time but it is still my favorite thing on the menu. However that night, the waitress gave my friend a beef wellington cooked medium-well, which was not what she had asked for but when she cut it it was actually more on the medium rare side which was what she wanted. Whereas I asked for medium rare and it looked more rare than medium rare. We still ate it and it was still tender but it wasn't cooked the way we wanted it. Our friend had the rack of lamb. It was breaded and very tasty. We let them know in advance that it was our friend's birthday and they provided a whole vanilla cake for free. They also took a polaroid of the group and they gave it to us...it's a nice little souvenir. 

The service on Friday wasn't as good as the service on Thursday. In general I did notice that the service is a lot better during the week when there are less people, which I guess makes sense. For example, it took awhile for the waiter to fill our glasses of water on Friday and we had to refill our own wine glasses but on Thursday our glasses of water and wine were always filled. One time I went and the waiter was so nice and gave me extra bacon for my leftovers and extra chocolate mints to bring home which I really appreciated. Normally I really enjoy the service here. 

Gibby's is good but I wouldn't say it is the best steakhouse in Montreal."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat. The steaks are especially good.  Make sure you get a reservation well in advance.  Very good wine list.  The pickles are always a hit.  Sadly the service is up and down.  We are batting about .500 right now, and it is getting close to us branching out to other places.  The owners need to make all of the servers understand that folks are dropping some good money and expect the human experience to be as the food."}
{"text":"The hotel concierge recommended to visit Gibby 's , so we went..
Located in the historical building in old town Montreal Gibby's wasn't that good as we expected it to be
The service was average , we waited for our food 40-50 minutes((
The food was pricy but average"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for work and my coworkers and I decided to go here because of the reviews. 

Honestly, I thought this place was overrated and over priced. I love steakhouses, but I was utterly disappointed with the flavor and taste of it. It was a little lackluster.

Foodwise, I ordered the French Onion soup which was okay. I've had way better. The top was too burnt and for an onion soup, the flavor wasn't there. It was just okay. My coworker and I split the Canadian lobster tail and the Gibbys ribeye steak to try the best of both worlds. So, portions were massive! For the price you are paying, I sure hope so. The lobster was good. It was cooked well, the butter sauce was good and I had the double baked potato which I think was the best thing I ate out of everything. The steak was a great piece, but as I've mentioned, the flavor didn't really hit me. I was expecting more, especially with all the great reviews from others - but I was disappointed.

The ambiance was pretty cool. It's a busy place so expect to be there for a couple of hours. We were there probably for 4. 

If you want an over priced, average steak, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"For the price, you can do much better in Montreal.  The place is stuffy, especially in the basement, the service is very inattentive, clueless at times and the waiter had little manners (Sniffles?  Blowing your nose?  Come on!).  You do get the feeling you're in a steak factory.

The prices are absolutely scandalous.  Expect to pay SAQx3 from the wine card.  The food itself is very good but you can get a comparable meal elsewhere.  We had the filet mignon and it was delicious.  The monte-carlo potato was top notch.

After dropping north of $230 for two, I will definitely never go back."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good steak place... buuut since America is probably the steak capitol of the world  - I was kind of dissapointed.

I think ruth's chris does a better steak yeah? Had both the rib eye and the wellington. Not bad. 

But for the price....

It's definitely one of the  nicer (pricier) restaurants in the area though. So if you are looking for that..."}
{"text":"After so many years Gibbys is still one of the best steakhouses in North America . I was there today with my wife we really enjoyed the food ,except on e little thing :) ok restaurant has 2 sections upstairs and downstairs , I never been downstairs before , ok it's nice but it was soooooo cold :))) constant cold air flowing from outside  they have to fix the heating system . Other then that? Nope no complains"}
{"text":"Excellent meal all around and perfect service. The French onion soup was excellent and the table pickles and bacon were very fun and new to us. The bread was awesome and the food was great. We really enjoyed it very much.

Only 4 stars because one of our steaks was overcooked, but they made it up to us by comping a dessert which was very nice of them."}
{"text":"I really loved this restaurant - one of my top picks in the city, and I loved every meal. We started with a variety of appetizers - jalapeno-stuffed sausage, smoked salmon, mussels, olives - they were amazing. I could have eaten the mussels as my meal, they were so delicious.

The service was also stellar and the wine fantastic. We ordered the sirloin cruste and petite fliet. Both were fabulous and the sides were also delicious.

I can't imagine how anyone could give this restaurant a poor rating. The service was stellar, food and drink were superb and it was such a neat location. Highly recommended overall."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned steakhouse. If you're feeling nostalgic, then this place is for you.  It's trendy, with all the perks of an old world restaurant :)
Steak and sides are very good. Salad is amazing.
It's on the expensive side... So maybe best kept for special occasions."}
{"text":"Warm bread and pickles

Gazpacho
A hint of spice. Delightful
Onion/spice after taste but not too strong.

Lemon sorbet (palate cleanser)
Worked really well because my mouth had a lot of aftertaste of onion left.

Monte Carlo
This came with our main. It was really good! And it came on a medium/large sized potato.

Rib Steak (Gibbys cut)
To be honest, I was kind of disappointed by the steak. There was too much gristle and the steak was rare, not medium rare.
But the other experience superseded the disappointment (even though I was looking very much forward to the steak). The sauce that came with it went really well with the steak though.
Side note: The portions here are huge and the cost performance is great. It might've just my cut that was bad.

Side dish of lobster tail
They tasted really good. Especially when you dip it in the garlic butter that comes with it.

My friends got the Beef Wellington, Salmon, and Mignons of Beef Diane, and they loved it! I've tasted them and they were better than my steak.

Service was on point. Our waiter was Sebastien. He filled our water very regularly, and he was very helpful with food/drink suggestions.

Overall, I would definitely come back again. :)"}
{"text":"Two words: clam chowder. The BEST I've ever had and I've been from east to west of Canada with no restaurant that can compare to here!! It is so rich and not too filling, with so much hearty meat (seafood ofc), seasoned so perfectly! My mouth is watering just remembering back to it. 

For the steaks - they are HUGE. Keep in mind, they don't mention the size (oz) of the steaks on the menu so I did not expect the big portions at all. My boyfriend ordered the Ribeye Gibby's cut which turned out to be 19oz, WITHOUT the bone. I ordered the NY Sirloin which was 16oz!!! Perfectly cooked to our preference and oh-so juicy. We were both wow-ed by our first bites. 

For the sides, we both got the Gibbys salad which was okay. The monte carlo potatoes on the other hand - definitely a treat if you want something more savoury than regular baked potatoes. It was recommended to us by our waitress and it did not disappoint. 

I really wish I had room for dessert, because that menu looked pretty good too. But with the shared clam chowder & a steak each, my boyfriend and I had some leftovers and were beyond stuffed. 

The service is amazing too - free valet, seated right away without a reservation and our waitress really took her time to go through the menu with us. 1 star taken off my rating because the restaurant was more than half empty yet the host sat us down right beside the workers station. So it was a teeny bit annoying trying to enjoy the ambiance when workers are constantly coming to the wall behind our table to wait around, dump their dishes or prepare their settings. Other than that, the food was amazing so will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has great steak. and French Onion Soup...the service was a bit spotty."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal with friends and decided to go after reading reviews. I liked the food. Not the most amazing food ever but I gave it a 5 because the service is amazing which makes the food taste better. I would def go back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Montreal,  especially for out of towners.  A fancy restaurant without any pretention. If you want a Jewish steakhouse in Montreal this is it.

The prices are high but include sides with your meal, unlike most steakhouses.  Choose the monte carlo potato, don't hesitate.  The Gibby's salad and the tomato salad are both good choices. Dont forget to add croutons and bacon.  The pickles and especially the bread put out on the table are delicious. Mouth currently watering for that slightly sweet and freshly warm bread.  I always used to get the crusted lamb.  The beef Wellington is amazing.  I recommend the fresh blueberry cheesecake for dessert.

A great choice for an occasion where you want to feel special."}
{"text":"Gibbys was recommended to us by others who have eaten here on their trips to Montréal. Gibbys is located in the beautiful, rustic neighborhood of \"Old Montréal.\" As soon as you walk in you feel like you're in a different era, a colonial era. Even the servers wear uniforms that remind you of simpler times.

Gibbys is open for dinner service and it's highly recommended you make a reservation. We were the first guests in the building for our reservation, but not even an hour later almost all the dining rooms were full and they were on a decent wait. There is a nice, large waiting area upstairs where there are many couches, seats, etc. The restrooms are also located by the waiting area upstairs and to my surprise it was a gorgeous, clean restroom (strange observation, I know, but too many places these days don't take care of their facilities).

Dinner service starts with bread, homemade pickles and fresh bacon bits. I didn't know what to do so I just ate the pickles and scooped some bacon bits in with the mixture. Their pickles are DELICIOUS. They are giant, whole pickles with lots of flavor and crunch. I started with the French Onion soup and wasn't impressed. Soup was very sweet and didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I'm more of a salty French Onion person, but that's just me.

For dinner I had the escargot. Escargot was delicious, but I was surprised it didn't come with toast or bread of some sort to dip in the oil. My Mom enjoyed her salmon and said it was perfect. It did look great and the vegetables accompanying the dish were just the right \"al dente\" style so I would say salmon there is a safe choice if you're looking for a fish dish. My fiancé had the filet and loved it as well. It was cooked to the temperature of his liking. 

I guess for the money I would expect presentation to be more than it was. None of the dishes had that \"WOW\" look to them. Taste is always more important than presentation, but sometimes presentation can deceive the mind into thinking the food tastes better, or vice versa.

I do want to note that the service was SPECTACULAR and we made sure our server knew it. She made our experience memorable. We were here celebrating my fiancé's birthday and she came out with a birthday cake (not sure if it was complimentary as I did not see the receipt) that said \"Happy Birthday Ryan!\" and was enough to feed 6-8 people, if not more. The cake was light and not too rich, with some lovely fruit in the mixture. We all loved it. They also take your picture and then at the end of the meal come out with a Gibbys paper frame with the picture inside! It's such a unique touch and we greatly appreciated the gifts. Everyone from our server to the hosts to the reservationist and management were extremely friendly and welcoming.

I would say this place is so popular because of the nostalgia feel it gives the folks of Montréal who have been dining here since they were children. The food was just OK to me. I'm glad I tried it, but don't know if I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! A gorgeous converted barn in old Montreal, the atmosphere is very friendly and warm. Food and service were great, up there with some of the best I've had. The table had rack of lamb, the Gibby's rib steak, and a chicken Kiev. All portions were huge so be warned! The quality was superb and all were perfectly cooked. An extensive wine list makes it easy to find something to suit your pallet and budget."}
{"text":"When asking the hotel concierge what was the best steakhouse in town, they said Gibby's. After securing a reservation for us, we took an Uber and we were so excited from the moment we saw the charming restaurant. The stone building held the traditions of a great restaurant. 

The menu is full of choices but it seemed clear to us to get the additional lobster tails with our steak which based on pictures on Yelp and our server, it was good enough for 2 people. The steak was a little more well done than the medium rare we ordered but it was good nonetheless. The lobster was tender and came on top of rice which we did not order but accompanied the lobster well. The baked potato with all the fixins already blended together in the potato is worth trying. 

It was my birthday and it was so sweet when our server took a picture of me and gave it to me in a Gibby's picture holder. I will not forget this delicious celebratory meal in such a historic atmosphere, friendly staff and wonderful food."}
{"text":"It's a birthday occasion for our gathering and I have to say that everything we ordered was better than expected.
Not only the food is fantastic, the ambient and service were one of the best we have ever experienced.
Will highly recommend to all our friends and family~
Will definitely come back to explore more dishes on their menu~"}
{"text":"Gibby's is old school and great.  The menu is full of classics like a New York or Steak Diane.  The building is classic Old Montreal, big old stone barn, free valet parking and a big dining room (only wished they had a patio).  

Get the Monte Carlo (twice baked) Potato, loved the Gibby's salad, fresh bread and the bowl of sour pickles.  The steaks were huge and the fish was fantastic.  I had the Rare Tuna and someone else had the Salmon.  Ask the server for suggestions, she had tons of ideas.  Treat yourself to a classic dining room experience.  I thought it was well priced, it's not cheap, but worth every cent.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the rib steak. Classic steakhouse with good services. All around great food and reasonable pricing. Location  is great"}
{"text":"This was the finishing touch to an outstanding culinary experience in Montreal!  This is an exceptional steakhouse with great food and a very classy atmosphere.  

We had a group of colleagues and everyone was very satisfied.  I started with the house salad which was simple but very good and went with the Gibby's cut for my entree.  This was such a flavorful steak and was cooked perfectly.  Per a recommendation from a colleague, I opted for the monte carlo potato to accompany the steak - I can honestly say this was the best riff on a twice baked potato I have ever had.  You have to try it!!!

For desert, we shared the profiteroles and also had the Brazilian coffee.  Both were great and the preparation of the coffee was a show to watch!

Our service was top notch throughout this great meal - was very happy to have visited and recommend everyone gives this a shot if they're looking for some great food and an even better experience!"}
{"text":"A famous restaurant in old Montreal which I have been many many times. Its become a tradition in our family that we come here on birthdays so today was my daughters turn. 
I must say that normally service here is just OK but tonight it was excellent and made a point on my way out telling management about it.
I had Gibby's cut Rib eye steak. With an onion soup to start. Both excellent. Although I found that the steak was a little tough it was still good.
I found that it was a nice added touch they gave a free bday cake and took a picture and gave it to us in a nice Gibby's card. Classy!!!!
We will continue to go back....."}
{"text":"Gibby's is by far one of my favorite steakhouses/seafood restaurants in Montreal!

Tucked away on a quiet street in Old Montreal, this restaurant proves itself time and time again with topnotch service and unbelievably prepared dishes! Free valet parking also makes this restaurant a great choice for those cold winter nights.

As per price, most people might consider Gibby's a little on the pricier side, but I've been to many steakhouses in North America, and Gibby's is a little bit more moderately priced than some others.

I highly recommend the filet mignon, to which you can add on an order of jumbo shrimp grilled in garlic butter if you're a surf and turf lover like me, or I also recommend the 2lb lobster, which can be served grilled or boiled.

They have a wide selection of other cuts of meat, seafood, and chicken.

All main courses come with a choice from two or three appetizers, but you should definitely go with the \"Gibby's salad,\" and you also get a choice of potato -- baked, mashed, fries, or double baked. Double baked is commonly referred to as a Monte Carlo potato, and that's always the one I choose!"}
{"text":"I came in from Texas not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality steak and atmosphere.  This place was highly recommended by everyone I talked to in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's an old fashioned experience and ambiance.
We came for my husbands birthday.
 
He ordered the ribeye and loaded baked potato. He liked it but has had much better.
I ordered the petit fillet, medium. It came medium well and chewy. My baked potato was undercooked. Really.
The best part of the meal was the birthday cake.
Expensive and nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Food was great! Met a gentleman from Egypt  who works as a hostess  was so lovely . Food was ok."}
{"text":"How can you not like a great steak especially when its in this very cool rustic stone building which is over 200 years old. Apparently this is a tough place to get reservations at but I had no problem calling that morning and reserving a Saturday night dinner at 8pm for 4 people. When we got there we only waited around 15 minutes for our table to open up and considering how packed it was I was pretty happy with that. We sat down and and had 4 completely different dinners all of which are cooked just right and tasted delicious. I had the prime rib, my friends had the rib eye, lamb and some other meal which I have forgotten, but I tried it, and I will vouch for whatever it is that he had. The drinks were a served a little bit different from what we were used to. Now its hard to tell if its a Canada thing or if this restaurant just made it a little different. That hardly takes away from the meal though as there was enough food that we were all satisfied. If we werent going out that night t party after, we would have finished off the food and been stuck in food coma till the next morning...but then again, thats usually what a hearty steak dinner can do to you anyways. Since I dont live in Montreal and its kind of a trip to get there Id love to sample other restaurants before I go back but you better believe I will be telling all of my friends who visit to check out Gibbys."}
{"text":"This iconic restaurant in the old port is a must when visiting Montreal. Opened two years after the first Gibby's (1972) in St Sauveur (1970) this place will definitely win you over if you're looking for a steakhouse.

I've only been here once many years ago and remembered having a really fun evening. This time around was to celebrate my mom's birthday. We were a group of 16. Some came late, other had way too many questions and demands. You know, the annoying ones ;). The waitresses were more then nice and patient. No complaints about the service here. Everything was great!

The wine list was ok. It has too many American wines and certainly not enough wines from France (they only had red Bordeaux). Menu is pretty straight forward and there is no extra fee for sharing the plates! Now THAT i love!!! Our meats were cooked to perfection. The only thing that i didn't like was the watery/wilted salad. I think they dressed it too early. Portions are huge! Free pickles! Free bread and free real bacon bits. 

I don't think i could afford eating here every week but can certainly come back when craving a great steak!"}
{"text":"Really cool place... You can see and feel the history in Gibby's interior, but it's not just for tourists. Many locals eat here regularly, and it's easy to see why.

The food and service are fantastic, and it's both an experience and a consistently great meal when you come here. They also offer a very nice wine list, and heavenly desserts

Recommended"}
{"text":"I was torn between rating Gibby's a 4 or a 5, but Shannon, our server, deserves it to be a 5.  Before I go into any other detail, I need to make sure you all know  the service is hands down some of the best we have had. Drinks were never close to being empty throughout our 2 hour meal.

The food is phenomenal--from the appetizers to the meals. We had the shrimp cocktail, French onion soup, Gibby's salads (yum! Where can I get that dressing in the US), a Gibby's cut ribeye and a petite filet Mignon. Both steaks were cooked perfectly. I was jealous of my husband's steak because he got the garlic butter/herbs on his, but mine was fabulous, too. The Monte Carlo potatoes are also delicious! I wish we had room for dessert--the apple crisp that was going by looked to die for.

The only downfall to our dinner was that we were seated in the basement area, and it was extremely loud. I know Gibby's is located in a city, and I know the majority of loud parties were Americans (like myself) enjoying a night out in Montreal, so I can overlook the small let down. Just be forewarned if you're looking for a romantic dinner, this may not be the ideal place to go on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"It is a very nice traditional Steakhouse in Montreal. Food, service and the atmosphere of restaurant are so impressive. Especially Wellington Steak and Rib Steak are delicious! Love this place!"}

The steak is out of this world! I would recommend the teriyaki shish kabab or the filet mignon. Medium well was good for me. The Malbec wine by the bottle is also a good bet. 
Do not fill up on bread before you get your meal because the portions are sizable! Service is great. 
You can't eat outside, only have a drink. 
The crowd is older. But who cares cuz the food is so good! 
They give you mint chocolate at the end!
Don't forget to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Atmosphere is cozy, feels like a lodge.  Food was decent, but no creativity and definitely not exciting food.  Check out my blog for more!"}
{"text":"We had Christmas dinner at Gibby's, and experienced some lapses in service during our time there. 

The food was generally good. The grilled Arctic char and gibby's cut of steak were cooked well and pretty delicious. The Monte Carlo potato and the chocolate delight was yummy too! Portions were humongous. However, the escargot, Gibby's salad, gazpacho and creamed spinach were so-so and could be skipped. The wine we ordered was not bad, but we later discovered it was priced at least 3x the average commercial price for the bottle. 

The ambiance was also generally good. We were not rushed and were able to have good conversations and sufficient privacy. 

In terms of service, my friend who ordered the lamb rack got her order delivered wrong twice. Once it was overcooked to the point of being difficult to separate, the next time it was delivered almost blue inside. While our waitress was courteous and did all she could, including offering a complimentary dessert for this, these mess-ups at the kitchen side still delayed our dinner considerably and made it awkward for my friend who felt bad returning the food, and who either felt compelled to finish her meal fast or sit awkwardly without her dish while waiting for a replacement. 

We also experienced an incident at coatcheck, with a friend's gloves and metro card falling out of her pocket during the time. Luckily she realised her gloves were gone before we left and returned for it. The coat check lady clearly knew that the gloves had fallen out of someone's pocket as she was able to quickly retrieve the gloves from the front desk, but she had not proactively displayed the gloves or asked if anyone had lost their gloves. 

My friend only realised her metro card was also missing when we reached the metro station after a grueling walk in the ice and snow. We called Gibby's to request they do a search and confirm if it was with them. Gibby's front desk was rude and curt, and said they would call back IF they found the card only. As I explained that we would want to know WHETHER they found the card or not as we were waiting at the metro station and would walk back immediately if so, Gibby's front desk initially refused to do so but later cursorily said that they would. We spent some time waiting at the metro and eventually decided to just repurchase a metro card as it was late and cold. We never got a call back from them. 

Those incidents really ruined our Christmas night, which was a pity given that we spent quite a lot at this restaurant (almost half a thousand for a group of 6) and had looked forward to it as our festive treat for our trip. Therefore I feel extremely ambivalent about recommending this restaurant or returning again."}
