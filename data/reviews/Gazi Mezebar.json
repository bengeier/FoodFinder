{"text":"We arrived at 8:15pm ordered some appetizer which came out quite quickly and were delicious. We then ordered our main course at 9:00pm and by 10:30pm we still hadn't received our main courses. The manager and waitress weren't very apologetic and didn't do anything to make us happier. Horrible service for what could've been a great spot."}
{"text":"I was at the Gazi Mezebar for the first time on the night of June 9 for a Greek concert. One of my favorite Greek stars, Giorgos Sambanis, was singing for the second night of his 2 day concert in Toronto at the venue.. I was one of the earliest in the bar at around 10 pm and by 1130 pm when Giorgos came on, the place was packed full . I was the only Asian there and was glad to make friends with a Greek couple. The decor and vibe of the bar were great .. However, an hour and a bit to the show, I smelled cigarette smoke and true enough, quite a few people in the front of the stage who probably paid a high price for their tickets were found smoking...and no one at Gazi made them stop.. Really unfair to non-smokers who went there to enjoy the concert. I guess the place was so cramped the 'VIP's didn't want to move from their seats to squeeze themselves through the crowds to the door to smoke. A really terrible situation here cos I found it hard to breathe and couldn't stay till the end of the show.  I didn't try any of their food which was mentioned in the previous 2 reviews and am not sure if I want to return to the bar ... Just hoping the manager/owner enforce a non-smoking rule and not let anyone get away with it, regardless of whether they are important guests or not.  Agree?"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday evening after work with some friends for dinner. My friend heard of this restaurant through BlogTo, and wanted to give it a try.   It was a bad idea.   The restaurant was completely dead and i think i lost my hearing from the really loud music being played.   We ordered 4 dishes - thank goodness - and none of them tasted extraordinary. The most shocking one was  the beet salad. We ordered the beet salad hoping it would look somewhat to what they had posted on their Instagram account, but boy were we in shocked when it arrived at our table. I included the picture of our beet salad in my post. Please compare it to the picture on their Instagram picture. Very very very deceiving!   I will not be coming back again! Service was good, but food was not."}
