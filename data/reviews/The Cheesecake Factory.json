{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory period but The District location is my ultimate fave in Vegas."}
{"text":"Another all-time fave restaurant in Vegas ~ 

The food selection is tremendous and I end up ordering the same thing almost every time I dine here ~ Pasta Carbonara with chicken or shrimp ^_^ and of course I order a different cheesecake each time because they are all delicious. 

Their happy hour is a definite reason to come back ~ half off appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Omg! I love this place, amazing food, service, and friendly staff. My boyfriend and I come here quite a bit you have to get the avocado egg rolls they are the bomb ! Served with chili line sauce and chicken pot stickers but I would ask for the sauce on the side.for some reason the potstickers are swimming in the sauce  if ordered in original form.  If you decided to get a strawberry lemonade make sure to ask for water because it's overly  sweet. Entrees I got the luau salad it's amazing very healthy and he got the teriyaki chicken so good comes with your choice of brow., Or white rice . Lastly our server was very nice and attentive but seemed to be overwhelmed so we felt bad asking for anything."}
{"text":"Great service.  Good food. Monster portions and a menu that goes on forever. Just your typical Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer there,and I always get the same thing.which is the luau chicken salad.I realized that they had added pineapple to it,and it didn't have a flavor to it.plus I use to love the dressing ,but i realize that the dressing was too vinegry....and I realized that they put the complimentary bread in the microwave........

I honestly didn't want to make a scene,but I realize that ,something changed in that place,even though the food came out very quick,but I just felt ,who ever made that salad,did a sloppy job.by the way,it have been more then a week since i ate there.I honestly love the cheese cake factory,I will always come back,cause,they have stuff on their menu,that you can't find any where,but i just wish,the luau salad, didn't have the pineapple.plus it wasn't too appetiting."}
{"text":"Love the busy and loud atmosphere, perfect for a weekend retreat. I always go for the chicken little, their veggie and salads are also great. The portions are enormous, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant I patiently waited behind another customer who was greeted and taken to be seated. I stood in front of the hostess station for roughly 5 minutes without being acknowledged by the hostess, although there were numerous times where eye contact was made, there was no attempt to greet, acknowledge etc... At the point were she began to have a casual conversation with another hostess, I asked if she intended on seating my wife and I. She stated in a very short manner \"well I thought you might have been with another party that had already checked in\". A simple greeting and may I help you could have cleared any uncertainty.. My wife and I were then seated immediately by another hostess who apologized. I asked to speak with a manager and someone who appeared to be a waiter approached the table and stated that he was the manager and would address the poor customer service my wife and I experienced on what was our wedding anniversary lunch. He didn't seem to take my complaint very seriously and to top it off, once we received our food, it was extremely salty. I didn't feel another complaint would go anywhere so I kindly paid by bill, tipped the waitress Alisha and left.. I will never return."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for Dinner and were able to get a seat right away on the patio! There are heating lamps out there so was not chilly at all. We had the crab cake appetizer and Loved it was cooked crispy and delicious. I had my favorite salad Which is the Luau Salad and is a huge portion! Haley had the club sandwich and was excellent as well."}
{"text":"I love this place its got Morrocan Atmosphere and the food and service is very good! I love the variety of choices with a huge menu! They also have a Skinnylicious Menu if your trying to watch your calories. I had the Luau Salad and it was  Yummy with lots of ingrediants and very fresh tasting! They make excellent cocktails as well ! The passion ice tea is also very good!! They have amazing cheesecake choices as well."}
{"text":"For the first time I get disappointed at the cheese cake factory, we had one of the worst server ever. We had to wait forever to get our order in!!! And longer time to get our SALAD it's not like it has to be cooked. I know if I go back to the same location I'll make sure I don't get the same server horrible."}
{"text":"Oh CCF how you pleasure my taste buds with your delicious vanilla bean cheesecake! A must. Ordered to go and was bomb!"}
{"text":"Your name says what you do best and I understand that, you want that dinner crowd. And I'm gonna say this as nice as I can when you cook for people the least you can do is to use seasonings. A little salt and a little pepper can go a long way. If you don't wanna use salt you can use things like onions garlic and shallots. Ps switch to a better grade of ground beef your Sheppard pie was swimming in grease. The only reason I gave you a three cause your cheesecake can't be matched by no one."}
{"text":"Love the place!! This exactly whats needed after a long day exploring the strip & shopping. 
Staff are super friendly & overall the place is aesthetically pleasing. Usually pretty busy so you may end up waiting a while but the foods worth it. 

Got some buffalo chicken strips & guh... Big portions, yet so damned tasty ... & I still don't like celery regardless of what its dipped in. 
Refreshing smoothies to boot with care taken in regards to allergies. 
Tried the vanilla bean cheesecake, it was lovely & light. I'm gutted we didn't get to try all of the cakes the bakery looked amazing!!!!! 
Reasonably priced as well & overall pleasant experience, so I have no complaints asides from potentially long waits."}
{"text":"Spent $350 PLUS tip for 4 adults 3 kids. Service was meeting the BARE minimum at best. A lot of staff just clustered around the host stand. Had empty glasses for approx. half of our meal. Not at all what we expected for the price.

To make me even MORE angry, my husband, my little son and I, were SICK ALL NIGHT.  Upon calling my mom and sister, they were sick as well. Worst, my sister is pregnant and really doesn't need to be more sick than she already is! Whatever it was that we ate yesterday night at the good ol' cheesecake... had our factory's running. Needless to say, we are both at work today, suffering. 

We will NEVER go back. 

I didn't call management directly, because I have a feeling that they wont care at all. If management is a reflection of the staff that they hire... I don't think that the call would be worth my time. The apology will be half hearted and insulting... and they will probably assume that I am making all this up. 

BEWARE OF GETTING SICK HERE!  

I don't know how this place makes so much money!! YOU SHOULD BE EMBARASSED."}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory has typical prices for a chain but far better than typical quality food and service!

Highlights:
Best tex-mex egg rolls! All appetizers look so good
Extensive menu that caters to any customer
Good burgers
Cheesecakes were wonderful...lemon raspberry is my favorite
Timely service and very clean!

I'm excited to back and try a pasta dish and more appetizers!"}
{"text":"Incredibly good value with a great varied menu and the obligatory huge portions.
The snickers cheesecake was unforgettable!"}
{"text":"We went there Saturday. We were seated and waited over an hour for our meals.  There were 3 adults & 2 children.   We ordered salads & soup!!!!   Should NOT take over an hour.  Also 3 tables that came in AFTER us had their meals before us?????
When my soup & salad came there was NO sour dough bread.  Waitress said it didn't come with bread?   I got a menu again and it DID come with sour dough bread!  I told waitress that & she said. \"I never saw that before\"??????    I will NEVER go to  Hesse are factory again!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night for an impromptu dinner date and because we had a gift card to use. My husband ordered the Shepard's Pie & I ordered the shrimp scampi/herb crusted salmon combo. The quality of food has gone down the drain. My husband got super sick from the Shepard's pie! My plate had way too much sauce and was extremely garlicky. It was basically drowned in sauce, my shrimp was soggy and the plating was a mess. I don't think we will be ordering any food from the restaurant but only cheesecake."}
{"text":"Loved the avocado egg rolls. Unique flavor. Kahlua cheesecake was out of the world!"}
{"text":"I thought it was overpriced and it took forever to get seated. The pasta i ordered was ok, but there are better places for cheaper prices."}
{"text":"A table for two was a less than ten minute wait at 4:30 on a Saturday. Once we got to our table we sat at our table we were told our server would be right with us. 5-minutes in sitting time a different server with a giant flower in her hair said our server would be right with us. 10-minutes in that same server gave us some water. 15- minutes in we walked out.

I don't understand how this happened. We were looking forward to a delicious meal and received nothing but disappointment."}
{"text":"Great food great service never had a problem when coming here everything is always fresh waiters are always nice and the cheese cake is to die for"}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in AZ,  Vegas,  & SD. Starting to write my reviews.  This place was by far the best in service.   Food great but for the calories it better be. Well worth it. Our server Tanya was awesome."}
{"text":"Three of us girls rolled out late on Sunday morning and enjoyed the practically empty Cheesecake Factory by the Superstition Springs Mall out in East Mesa.  We sat by the bar in cozy wicker chairs and ordered brunch.

I had the Energy Breakfast, which was way more food than I could stomach, but very light and healthy (egg whites, tomatoes, chicken breast (2) and English muffins...erp).  My friends ordered French Toast and Eggs Benedict and they were all smiles.

Accompanying our meal were Chai Tea Lattes (scrumptious, they liberally added cinnamon) and a Vanilla Honey Latte.  Both came frothed.  (Tip: Don't breathe in when you drink the froth)  

Our waiter was handsome, helpful, earnest (we pressed him on if we should splurge and get the Monte Cristo) and even pronounced my last name correctly, which NEVER happens.  (big tip time)  

Everyone knows what to expect after going to The Cheesecake Factory, but I think their breakfast, which is available until 2pm, is a great way to start the day....or afternoon."}
{"text":"This review is based on my visit on August 1st, 2015.

I went here to enjoy the lovely Linda's Fudge Cake, and to enjoy dinner, too, of course! Our party arrived around 5:30, but was seated immediately, a shock considering the Saturday night crowd was arriving! The hostess who brought us to our table was one of the most chatty hostesses I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She asked me about my day, and appeared genuinely concerned with the guest experience, handing the menus to each person individually, a very nice touch. 

Unfortunately, it took quite a bit longer to see our waitress than I would have expected! Drinks took quite a while to arrive, but I was expecting this, given the size of the joint and the fact that most of our drinks came from the bar. After the waitress returned, I decided to order the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo, which came out of the kitchen not too much later. The gumbo was packed with flavor, though I was let down on how spicy it was. The texture was also fairly poor - it seemed almost mucous-like.

Fortunately, I was able to end the night with Oreo Cheesecake, not the Linda's Fudge Cake I had thought I would order. I couldn't have been happier with the choice to order cheesecake, it didn't have that rich, over-powering chocolate that Linda's Fudge Cake has. And, come on, who doesn't love Oreos?"}
{"text":"Of course once I began to read the novel the call the menu I found myself in that glutonous disposition where I wanted one thing from each page. I actually skipped on the appetizer (a first) in hopes of forking some food off of everyone elses plate, after I was done with my Bang Bang Chicken. YUM. Seriously chicken curry at the cheesecake factory? Yup. you name it and they've probably got it. Just avoid the Chicken Curry Cheesecake (kidding). Bring your reading glasses and decide the base food you want: steak, chicken, pasta. Trust me it will save you an hour."}
{"text":"It was prom night and bridal party night so fairly busy, yet our server was ver accommodating, seating us (just me & my husband on a quiet night out) in a fairly secluded booth for privacy.  The bread was mostly great.  The pumpernickel was absolutely delicious but the sourdough (was that what it was) was too hard and dry to bite into. No points lost there however, as some people enjoy crusty bread like that.

His kobe burger was cooked perfectly (he asked for rare) and my luau salad was consistently delicious, as it is whenever I get it. Always plenty to take home.

We ordered banana cream cheesecake and chocolate tuxedo cheesecake to go so I won't know how they are until later.

All in all a good experience. Friendly, accommodating staff (they happily brought us more bread when asked) and a comfortable environment. The music was a touch loud but I guess that's how most restsurants have it these days. It privides a bit of an auditory veil between us & other diners."}
{"text":"Salted caramel cheesecake : Right balance of salty and sweetness in every bite. The cake size is good as tea or dessert but too big right after a full meal course."}
{"text":"I love cheesecake factory . I love there raspberry lemonade and my family loves the jambalaya. The fettuccine Alfredo is really good. The cake is amazing. The Charlies outrageous cheesecake is so good. My family love the cheesecake."}
{"text":"We decided to check out the Cheesecake this past Saturday. Began lining up at 1:10pm. Thought the line was moving fairly quick, but that was just the line to put your name down. Got my name down at 2pm. Had to come back after 30 minutes to get a pager. Lined up again for another 10 minutes and then finally got one. Gave us an estimate of more than hour and half. Got our table at 4pm. 

I ordered the classic meatloaf. Same portion and flavours as when I get it from the states. We had to order our cheesecake while we waited for our main because the wait time was approx 1 hour. Our food took approx 20mins... the cheesecake took about 1 hour after it was entered. For a slice of cheesecake that's already pre-cut?? We decided to order cheesecake for take out while we were dining as well since the cheesecake take out line was out the front door/over 1 hour wait. 

Our server did not offer to refill our waters or bread, but service wasn't terrible. They definitely need more people working at the cheesecake counter. Will wait until after the holidays to return."}
{"text":"Like several reviewers here, I have been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants in other locations, enjoyed my various experiences, and was excited to see one land in Madtown. 

But...oh, boy...

The place was hopping at noon on the Monday before Christmas--admittedly one of the busiest times we could have possibly chosen. Lucky for me, my party was already seated in the bar when I arrived. The decor seemed swanky and modestly cool, but the first thing that struck me as I sat down was that the bar tables are far too small for a party of four to comfortably sit and eat lunch (amazingly, though, no disasters with water glasses or plates happened during our meal). The noise level was really quite uncomfortable. My party had ordered nachos as an appetizer, which gave me some time to peruse the menu and order. Quite a bit more time, it turned out, than I needed. 35 minutes later, the nachos arrived, followed shortly after (5 minutes) by our entrees. Our waitress, to her credit, was clearly annoyed that the food had arrived as it did. 

Back to my order. It was foggy and miserable outside, so I was in the mood for comfort food. I am a sucker for Shepherd's Pie, which I ordered despite the misnomer: SHEPherds herd what? SHEEP. Like, uh, lamb. (C'mon man, ground beef makes it COTTAGE pie! But, whatever.) When the entree arrived, it looked fine, albeit with an entire parsley sprig plopped unceremoniously on top (I tore off some leaves and shredded them over the dish). 

But my first bite revealed the insidious truth: hiding out beneath the copious mashed potatoes and gravy was...not ground beef. Not in the traditional sense. You see, my dish appeared to be a subterfuge for hamburger patties that had not made the cut at the grill (it didn't take much for my imagination to slide to the slimy bottom of that slippery slope--GAAAACK!). Many of the huge chunks of torn-up patty were burnt on one side or both, and all of them were quite bland. (Which made me wonder about the quality of the hamburgers--but I'll leave that for some other hapless patron to review!) A few vegetables had been tossed in and the mix was slathered in gravy, then cleverly hidden under fluffy mounds of cheesy mashed potatoes. After a few bites of this vile concoction, I ate enough of the mashed potatoes to fill me up--as in, the part that was not in contact with the slop--and left the rest. There were no questions from the waitress when she took my almost entirely slop-filled plate. It didn't matter, because I would not have ordered anything else: I was too grossed out. The very idea of re-purposed food makes me gag.

So...to recap. Long wait. Loud. Slow service. Expensive. Truly sub-par food. 

Sounds like a job for Kitchen Nightmares.

Need I say that I won't be back?"}
{"text":"The hostess lost our seating ticket. Then sat us at a dirty table. Took 20 minutes to be greeted or get drinks. My husband found a bone in his chicken dish. When I asked for a manager she said, \"I wish you would have told me sooner that you had a bad experience.\" FYI management, do not ever put any blame whatsoever on the guests."}
{"text":"The food has been great here but today my wife and I  had a similar reaction after eating the mushroom burger. Don't know why yet. Talked to manager,"}
{"text":"I should start by saying that Cheesecake Factory used to be my favorite restaurant ever. And this particular Cheesecake Factory used to be on point. But it's been off for a while. I keep giving them chance after chance to get back to how they used to be but every time it's a major disappointment . I got one of my go-to dishes tonight--crusted chicken Romano. It was mushy and totally flavorless. I used to be happy to pay the price they ask because the food was always delicious. But as of tonight, I'm done with the Cheesecake Factory. I should also note that my disappointment is so profound that I signed up for yelp for the specific purpose of giving this poor review. Cheesecake Factory lovers: be wary!"}
{"text":"My first visit ever and I was pleased by the service, décor and the huge menu. Although I don't eat cheesecake it was easy to see why so many flock to this establishment. My son loved it and so did his friends. I hear Reno will have a Cheesecake Factory coming soon! Wahoooooooooo!"}
{"text":"Get yourself a Peach Bellini while waiting for the avacado eggrolls, so good!"}
{"text":"Love the cheesecakes but not so much the food. Since I can't eat a whole lot of sweets I mainly order the Thai Lettuce Wraps, it's probably the best thing on the menu besides the dessert. 

You would think Thai Lettuce Wraps is hard to mess up on, but sadly they burnt my chicken. It was a total disappointment for me! As for the pastas they are A-O-K; the Cajun jambalaya is probably the best one. Made to perfection! Most of the other pastas seem to be dry (lack of sauce). 

Best part of all DESSERT! I love the red velvet cheesecake, so if you haven't tried it yet I would definitely try it. 

As for service, not the best, the server forgot a lot of things and would disappear out of no where when I needed him. Not only did he forget to get my drink but he messed up on other peoples order."}
{"text":"Today was our first time at The Cheesecake factory,  I was kind of skeptical about how the food was going to be as this is a chain restaurant.  However,  I was pleasantly surprised. We only had a 10 min wait during the Sunday lunch rush,  once seated our server promptly took our drink order.  We got the egg roll sampler which was good as well as fresh sourdough and wheat breads.  For our main course we got the fresh Basil and tomato flat bread,  pot stickers,  the lousianna chicken pasta and a chicken parmesan sandwich.  Everything was delicious and even the the first two items we order we're small servings they we're perfect for staying low calorie like we wanted.  We then got the kaluha coco cheesecake and the chocolate hazlenut crumble cheesecake. These we're both amazingly delicious!!!!!  I didn't even get a picture of these because we couldn't wait to dig in.  

For a family of four our bill came to around $80 (we ordered water and no soft drinks or alcohol)."}
{"text":"I go to this Cheesecake Factory a lot because It's close by, the food is good and there is outdoor patio dining which is one reason I go there, I like to dine outside.  I had friends arrive from the cold Midwest yesterday and having been cooped up on a plane all day, they were looking forward to having a nice dinner outside on the patio.  Driving up to the place, we were happy to see that lots of emptyt patio tables.  

I dropped my guests off while I went to park the car and told them to go get seated and I'd find them.  After parking the car, I went right to the patio looking for them and was confused when they were not there. I walked in the front door and finally saw them waving at me from a booth way in the back, by the washroom.  As I made my way over to them, I saw there were all kinds of empty tables, far away from the washroom.  My friends told me the hostess informed them it would be at least a half hour wait for an outside table but she'd give them a nice table inside.  Nice?  A dark booth by the washroom door!  Nice?  I went back to the hostess and explained to her I had just come in from dropping my friends off and she immediately pointed and said \"Oh, I just seated them over there\".  I answered that I knew that and asked why we couldn't sit outside when there were so many empty tables and she said there were only two servers outside.  I said we wouldn't mind waiting outside at a table for the half hour until a server could wait on us. I told her we had come especially to sit outside and that furthermore, if we did have to dine inside, I was not prepared to sit in a dark cramped booth, way in the back by the washroom when there were plenty of other desirable empty tables.  She began giving  me some kind of idiotic reason why she couldn't do that and made some remark about getting the manager for me to talk to.  I told her her not to bother, we'd go someplace else where we could dine outside.  I went back (by the washroom) to inform my friends we were leaving and just then a really nice waiter, Tony P., whose table they were sitting at, came and told us he would take use out to the patio and serve us out there, even though it wasn't in his station.  We agreed and from then on, the evening was perfect.  

Tony P. was pleasant, attentive and courtious and we didn't have to wait long at all to be served.  As usual, the food and wine were excellent.  So, what began as my first bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory due to an indifferent hostess, ended with my friends and I having a delightful dinner, thanks to our server, Tony P."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout to bring back to my room at Caesars.  Chicken and biscuits, steak Diane and mac and cheese.  The cashier said 20 minutes, and I came back at 15 minutes and saw a bag near the register.  After waiting 5 minutes for the people ordering cheesecake to get their orders, I got her attention and asked if it was mine.  She said yes but she was waiting on the mac and cheese.  After another ten minutes she said it shouldn't be much longer, and finally went back to check and came out with it.  I said my dinners had to be ice cold by now and she very rudely said it's fine and handed me the bag.  When I opened the dinners a few minutes later (it only took three minutes to get back to Caesars) the food was ice cold and garbage.  It was almost a half hour from when the dinners came out until the dried up mac and cheese was added.  Totally unacceptable that a takeout order leaves the kitchen before everything is ready.  We threw most of it out because it was inedible."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory is in a great location right off of the 215 and Green Valley. Lots of available parking, comparatively speaking to the Summerlin location at Boca Park. We arrived at 6:30pm this Friday night and waited for about 30 minutes. Even though it was really busy, none of the servers seemed to be running around with no remorse for guests who were waiting in the lobby/hostess area. I've been to Cheesecake Factory's in the past where this has happened.

After we sat down we were greeted by our waitress Andrea R. Very knowledgeable, very friendly and patient. DEFINITELY, three important qualities needed for working here as a server. 

We started with avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts. Avocado egg rolls, as always were fantastic. Buffalo blasts were great as well, however it seems there's a little too much extra breading around the outside. I'm sure for the cooking style it's beneficial, and they are still very delicious otherwise and definitely a sufficient enough portion. 

Since the dishes are so plentiful, I chose to order an additional appetizer, the Crabcakes. They were fantastic (even though I only enjoyed one of the three) and served fairly well. The only adjustment to this dish I would make is how the Crabcakes are served. They are presented on a bed of Chinese noodles (little foam type noodles). As you cut through the Crabcakes the noodles stick to the Crabcake and it changes the consistency of the bite. The crabcake itself was DELICIOUS. But, it would have been far better if I didn't have to fight noodles through every bite! 

After dinner I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple Cheesecake and it is wonderful. Not too sweet, very satisfying if you're a chocolate lover. 

The service here is excellent, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere like any Cheesecake Factory is comfortable. I will come back here again and I would recommend any one else too as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten here way too many times. I still like it once a month now. I have been weaned off my edible crack, however I can and will have that relapse. I suggest the Orange Chicken. Damn good cheesecake!

The specials never change. I never order them.

I will eat at least 2 baskets of their wheat bread."}
{"text":"Not very good service.  Maybe they are busy but we have been coming here for many years and it has been getting worse.   The table is still dirty and bathroom is also not clean.  I can't stand that. The manager at this location doesn't know how to say \"I am sorry\".   They seem to feel that responding to customers is a waste of time.  That's it! I am done here.  We should have stopped coming a while ago but kept giving them the benefit of the doubt since we had been coming here for so many years."}
{"text":"My family loves the food here and the great service! Not to mention of course the cheesecakes! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, if you like oily chicken dishes. The seafood dish was good, the service was good too. The desserts were out of this world!!"}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory needs to work on their Curbside To Go! EVERY time I order pick up they MESS UP! EVERY TIME! I don't recommend it. Yummy food but bad service!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner served on the patio.  The steak Diane was amazing, especially for a chain restaurant.  Anne Marie took exceptional care of us and earned a 25% gratuity for her extraordinary efforts. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years but a co-worker suggested it for lunch yesterday and I was glad he did. The parking situation here is terrible but once inside we slid up to the bar area and enjoyed a great lunch. The service was prompt and friendly even during their busy lunch rush and my water glass never ran empty; which is a big deal to me. We split the chopped salad from the \"skinny\" menu as well as a sausage flat bread and both were delicious. The chopped salad is huge and was more than enough for both of us and the sausage on the flat bread had great flavor. I will certainly be keeping this place in mind for further meals."}
{"text":"I recommend the shrimp scampi paired with well...anything. This continues to be my very favorite dish after 20 years. My most favorite version is the traditional way it comes with angel hair pasta, but it's also awesome with one of the combination choices, like the herb crusted salmon. And it's hard to go wrong with any of the cheesecake, of course."}
{"text":"Yep it's a Cheesecake Factory alright. 

Giant portions, decent food, standard upper-middle tier chain type prices. Expect to have enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Nothing is out of the ordinary for this this Cheesecake Factory. The wait staff is friendly, the building is huge and they have a lot of outdoor seating. It was very nice and a mildly breezy spring evening. 

They have advertisements in the menu as if it were a magazine. I'm not offended by it, I just thought it was odd.

{"text":"Their \"Glamburgers\" are very good! Le Burger at the Paris Casino is still better, but I was pleasantly surprised! The last time I ate here was a year ago and my fish and my husband's steak were both grossly undercooked...and they MICROWAVED them and reserved them to us. A year later, I didnt get the fish, hahah! I got the Farmhouse burger, so good! Over-easy cooked egg on top. Cant miss it! Shephards Pie is OK but best shephards pie in the area is at McMullins Pub by the Orleans Casino."}
{"text":"Always great! Their menu is so big it's hard to decide what to choose. Great for groups or with a friend, never a disappointment.
Staff is always friendly, reasonably priced for the huge portions and plenty of healthy options."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service!!! Both over the phone and in person!! I waited on hold twice to place a to go order. The first time I was disconnected after a couple of minutes the second time I gave up and hung up as I was almost to the restaurant anyways!! Walked in the was rudely directed to the bakery. Waited there to place my order. Was given the wrong order and had to ask for it to be corrected which it was. The cheesecake is always good but I will drive further to a different location for better customer service any day!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bristo shrimp pasta tonight and a fresh lemonade. The pasta and the sauce was on-point, but I was disappointed to find most of my shrimp was burnt black. The waiter was kind enough, when he noticed me picking out the shrimp to get me new shrimp... However at this point I was already done eating and boxing up my left-overs. The fresh lemonade was very sweet-- fair warning if you are hoping for tart lemonade. 
Overall, the service was great and the atmosphere is always nice; it just depends what you decide to order from the extensive menu if you will really enjoy the while experience. 
BUT- I am disowning The Cheesecake Factory yet... I have had some really great meals with them. ( Like the beet & goat cheese salad and their non-alcoholic piña colada) B"}
{"text":"I had a very good experience with Cheesecake Factory and didn't even dine in. I called to place an order over the phone for pick up and spoke to a lady named Chris and she was amazing! She answered questions I had about their amazing streak tacos that they have and was so nice about everything. She even allowed me to have the sauce on the side because I preferred it to be on the side. 5 stars for Cheesecake Factory and for Chris. Thank you for your wonderful customer service, I hope you see this :)"}
{"text":"Crazy busy & loud! The food is amazing. Menu is a bit overwhelming for a first time customer. Cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"We visited Cheesecake factory for take out tonight. Isabel was so kind and accommodating! I had my baby in my arms and she promptly took my order and my food was ready in minutes. She walked around the corner and said, \"let me walk you to your car, clearly your hands are full.\" It was pouring outside and she went above and beyond to help a mom. I appreciate the over the top customer service and will return. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Customer service was not that great. We were taken to 3 different booths because the tables had not neen cleaned yet. Why not just have us wait? After the tour through the restaurant, I ordered the chicken picatta. It was fair at best. My son had the hibachi steak which was very good. And my daughter had chicken alfedo. Then the waitress made an unforgivable error. After she took my daughters left over plate (to pack in a to go box), she first stopped by a dirty table to clear dishes. She walked back into the kitchen with my childs plate of food in one hand and someone's dirty dishes in the other. Total cross contamination!! YUK!! Needless to say...we left the to go box there and it ended up being a waste of money and a disappointment!"}
{"text":"great restaurant! love to come here to celebrate special occassions (birthdays, graduations , etc) with friends and family. Food is always good, and service is excellent! We celebrated my son's birthday Feb. 6th of this year, 2016 and we enjoyed the food and appreciate good , professional, attentive service .My family, and friends will sure comeback again, and again! Keep up the good work, Cheesecake Factory!!! yeay!"}
{"text":"I took my husband for his birthday last night, the staff was awesome! I dropped off balloons and flowers before we went and they were very helpful surprising him! They brought it out with the dessert and sang happy birthday.  The personal touch really made it an excellent time!  Thank you so much for the help!"}
{"text":"Adrian the bartender, probably one of the best I've seen.  Being a bartender myself. Great food and beer. Definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch today with my family and was served ANTS in my lemonade but it was OK because they said sorry after I had drank some of it."}
{"text":"Walked into Cheesecake on a Friday night, 15 minute wait so that wasn't too bad. Once we were seated, the waiter took maybe 10 minutes to get us water, which wasn't a big deal considering it was relatively busy. Once it came time to order, I ordered what I usually love getting which is the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.. When it came to our table, I took one bite and noticed that it wasn't quite right. The bun was toasted way too much, to the point where it was like biting into a burnt cracker. Also, there was maybe a pinch of buffalo sauce. Maybe. But I couldn't see it or taste it. So, naturally, I ask the waitress if they could take it back and make it again. She apologized and said she would be happy to have the cooks do that for me. What happens next was down right disgusting. She put my plate on top of someone else's dirty plate with half eaten rice and tomatoes on it, and brought my food back to the kitchen to be made again.. Or so I thought. They ended up just throwing another bun on it and sent my bitten-into sandwich back to me. One thing I learned from working in a restaurant, you never bring someone's food from the table, to the kitchen and back to the table again... You should always  prepare a new dish. After that I received no discount, no coupon, nothing but an apology for the burnt bun. Very grossed out and disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in and asked for a table, they gave me a pager and I gave them my phone number. They said that they would call me and give me a quote for time. They never did. I came back in about 45 minutes and the lady at the desk was very apologetic and said that they would be ready for me in about another 45 minutes. I came back after that 45 minutes and gave my name and the lady had to go get someone and talked to her for about 5 minutes as if you there was something wrong. She then came back to me and told me that if I wanted to eat there it would be another 45 minutes. I waited an hour and a half just to be told that id have to wait for two and a half hours total to eat after driving an hour there. I am very disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory and will not be making the long drive just to be turned down ever again."}
{"text":"Just left the location in the Chandler Fashion Center mall and I had to write a review. The food looked and tasted great, and the service was good and quick for a weekend lunch. 

I ordered a BBQ burger cooked medium rare with fries and my fiancée ordered a Cuban sandwich. Both were bigger than expected and cooked as ordered. 

The menu at Cheesecake Factory is huge and there were lots of entrees I wanted to try. I even scoped out other tables to see how their food looked at it was all awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience Shawn was our main waiter and he was great. Great service by the whole staff. Shawn went xtra mile"}
{"text":"It is a corporate chain. The food is consistent across all the restaurants and it is good to excellent depending on what you order from the enormous menu. The skinnylicious offerings are quite good too - sometimes I wonder how they actually lower the calories in these meals (smaller portions and probably higher salt content).

We have gone to this location at least a dozen times over the past year. In almost all cases, the service has been excellent. Friendly and attentive. All you would expect.

In terms of parking, it's generally easy in the \"token\" lot right in front of the restaurant (2 hours free). If you are going at a busy time, there is additional free parking at the back of the shopping center only a few minutes walk away. There is also valet parking.

In terms of the wait, you might experience one depending on when you go. It's a popular place. We try to go just before the busy hours (e.g. 11:45 on a weekend) so we haven't waited more than ten minutes. However, when we leave around 1pm, I can see that there is probably a 15-20 minute wait.

Good place for lunch or dinner. We'll keep going back."}
{"text":"The food is always good, fresh, and cooked to order! We love this place! The staff is always friendly!

A ton of complaints about the wait, but that's part of the character of this restaurant. If you want to eat here during a busy time (weekends, some evenings) you're going to have to wait. There's no way around it. There's no call ahead, there's no app to get a better place in line, there's no giving a cell phone number and getting a text when your table is ready. If you want to eat here you have to wait the old fashioned way.   That being said, if the wait is over an hour we will often go to the mall for a little bit, but beware your pager doesn't reach past the front doors and if you miss your page you lose your spot in line!"}
{"text":"The food and service is always great when we come here. 
We got the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer: excellent!
I got the mushroom burger, which was delicious since I'm a big mushroom lover. 
For dessert, I got the red velvet cheesecake... Amazing!! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go for Thai but my dining partner wanted cheese cake and we both wanted to eat outside. 

The service was all you could wish for, the atmosphere is chain, the cheese cake looked good.

I chose a healthy chopped vegetable salad that was meh, fine. I can't even find descriptive words for it. It was as if on a lazy day I cleaned out the fridge of bits and ends of cooked and raw veggies. Mostly lettuce, huge bowl, couple chunks of asparagus, unexceptional dressing, a couple pieces of beet, a handful of good cheddar chunks on the top for $10 without chicken.  

For $12 I could have gone to Mad Mex and had a similarly large salad with lots of grilled chicken and a spicy sauce, for $7.50 I could have had a homemade Thai soup with drunken noodles at Red Orchid.

I will never willingly go here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed! I asked for pumpkin cheesecake with NO whip cream. I get home and whats on my cheesecake..... You guess it, whip cream! I'm not sure what it is about customer service in 2013 but it's awful. Aside from me having to scrape whip cream from a $8 slice of cheesecake, the actual taste was eh. I had to doctor it up a bit with some pecans and carmel from my kitchen. I WILL NOT RETURN!"}
{"text":"I arrived right on time but I didn't make a reservation so it was no problem. I had a gift card but it couldn't be used towards food or drink so I bought a t-shirt. The sizing was a bit off I have to admit. What is usually a medium for me is more like a small at the factory. Biggest complaint would have to be about the sizing. And not a lot of designs. It would be cool if they had one that just said THE FACTORY on the front and on the back it said 'cheesecake, that is' and their hours. Get your shit together."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Terrible table, terrible service. I was served a fly in my drink, and no one apologized. It took 15 minutes to get a new one. Used my Christmas gift, a Gift card to pay full price for a meal I was too disgusted to eat. Ruined my Valentines day 2016. WILL NEVER RETURN. shame on you for acting like YOU DID NOT SERVE ME A BUG. GROSS!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday dinner.  Server acted like we were the first table he ever took an order from.  He was very unsure of himself.  
Food was presented cool not warm or hot like it should have been.  I ordered the shrimp and pasta dish.  Shrimp were cold and smaller than I would have liked.  My spouse's entree had very little flavor.  Salt helped.
Didn't order dessert as they already had too much of my money.  Probably will never go back.  Very disappointed and on my birthday to boot."}
{"text":"This is the first time we didn't have to wait for a table at Cheesecake Factory. We were shopping at the outlets during Memorial Day Weekend, and wanted to grab dinner at the outlets before returning to The Strip. The service was fast and the food was decent. Will definitely return if we are shopping at the outlets."}
{"text":"Called when they opened requesting reservation for 6...informed that they do not make reservations after 5. Which is fine. Except after 45 mins of waiting we saw a group who came after us be seated with the same amount of people as us. Numerical error I'm sure, but considering it was a birthday celebration they made it less than pleasant. We even asked if they could allow us to sit on the patio, that was a no. Eventually we realized that our business was not appreciated or wanted. Thanks for the waste of time."}
{"text":"I know alot of people seem to like this place,but you wont see me going there again.We had some friends in from Boston,and they wanted to eat somewhere that wasnt very fancy,so we picked Cheesecake factory.You should know that our groupd consisted of our 2 friends,my husband,my 4 yr old son and my 2 yr old son,and myslef who was 9 months preggers at the time.
               When we got there,it was extremely crowded,we gave them our name and they said 10 minutes tops.Well 40 minutes later we were finally seated.The waitress was nice but stuffed us in to a very small booth.She was slow bringing our drinks and our apps,and only refilled our drinks once.
           All of this could have been forgiven if the food was good.My husband and friend Tim ordered the steak both medium rare,what they got was a piece of meat smaller than the palm of my hand fully cooked.I ordered the Philly Cheese sandwhich,it had no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave.Ive bought better at Wal-Mart.I ordered two kids chicken finger dinners for my boys but they only brought out 1 and when I told the waitress,she insisted that I only said one and that maybe the boys should share because the kitchen was really busy.
                    I will never go to this restaurant again,bad service,horrible food,and not a good value at all."}
{"text":"Some people go here just for the dessert and I cant blame them.
ADAMS PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE was honestly a harmonious blend of peanut butter and chocolate. Neither too strong or too soft, just good. 
That's what we ate the next day. At home.
Because I couldn't bring myself to even attempt the cheesecake, after the buffet we had at the restaurant.  We went unannounced on Valentine's night. The wait was an hour which was understandable. 
AVOCADO EGG ROLLS and FRIED MACARONI & CHEESE.  Sound like a lot? No, me either, but I couldn't finish my meal. So I guess it was. We really underestimated those appetizers, because I'm dumb. And honestly that could've been our meal.
And I don't why but I keep trying to find a suitable mac and cheese, but I guess I just like it simple. Because anything too fancy just doesn't do it. For me.
CAJUN PASTA JAMBALAYA  was the dish across, and the SHRIMP SCAMPI & SALMON was the dish in front. Of me that is.  I know what shrimp and salmon taste like, but That salmon was perfect. Enough for me to mention it again here, I was just pleasantly surprised. Even with how full I was, I dominated that thing. Like a duck. (No chewing)
If you've never been, then you should, at least once. It's one of those places that you wish you could call it you're favorite restaurant (because of the decor, the ambiance, the food) but then you see the people you're eating around with, because you decided not to get a booth. And sad face. 
But it stills bare mention though, it's just not a place you want to go all the time. Just once in awhile."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant a couple of years back and had a much better experience with both the service and food.  This time it was quite a disappointment.  Much smaller portions and everything tasted the same.  Food was not presented in an appealing manner (kind of slopped on the plate...what's up with that?!) and as usual, martinis waaay over priced.  I don't mind paying for expensive alcohol, but the food better be up to par or the waiter/ress better be over par.  It seems the quality over all with this particular CF has gone down over the years."}
{"text":"Red velvet cheesecake is the bomb. Like that they're offering healthy choices showing calorie count. Pricey but the serving can last me another meal."}
{"text":"Lots of choices but the food always seems to be bland for the price. And more then once I got the orange chicken and it tasted weeeeird. If your in Scottsdale there are so many better places to eat, I can't understand how this place gets so busy."}
{"text":"If you want a place that has something for everyone this is the place.  The menu is at least 15-20 pages long.  Check online before going so you are not completely overwhelmed.

We have been here twice.  The first time we had a horrible experience with service.  We asked to have the manager come to our table and he only spoke to me even though my husband was talking to him.  We were given free cheesecake as a compensation and it was warm.  Needless to say we were not impressed.

We tried it again last year and the wait was long again, but at least we got to our table when promised.  Service was better too.  He did mix up drinks and checks though at the end with our party.

If you have not been- go once and see what you think.  Most of the prices are $8-$15.  Cheesecake will run you between $5-$8 a slice."}
{"text":"The wine was great, the cheesecake was awesome, the crab cakes were delish! My daughter had the mini corn dogs a great deal and she loved them! Very impressed with the cleanliness of a restaurant located in a busy mall."}
{"text":"We ordered, a relatively small order over the phone to pick up and we were told it would be ready to pick up in 20-25 minutes. We arrived at the restaurant and proceeded to wait 45 minutes before our food was ready. We had to call three times for our food to be brought to curb-side pick up. The food was up to its usual standards, but if you want a quick meal, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but not as good as I remembered. Also, expect to wait 3x the amount of time that you're told."}
{"text":"Grabbed a seat at the bar and a bartender immediately came over to take my drink order. Despite there being an hour wait for  table, I ordered dinner at the bar and had it within 10 minutes. They were busy but incredibly fast and polite. Good food and great service at this location!!"}
{"text":"Our server was David Allen. We visited on July 30,2013. This guy was EXCELLENT. He showed real enthusiasm, good menu knowledge and was fun! We watched him show this same attitude at both large and small tables. Our meal was great (bowtie pasta dish and chicken madeira) and we gladly left a large tip for which our server expressed sincere appreciation. Good dining experience!"}
{"text":"We were given a gift card for the Cheesecake Factory as a wedding gift & figured, well hell, let's use it for a meal while we are in Vegas on our honeymoon. Las Vegas is an expensive city so I won't say no to a little bit of help to buy some food!

First of all, let me start out by telling you about our waitress. Her name is Alicia & let me just say that this girl really knows her stuff. She knows the menu well & is very informative. She went above & beyond in her customer service. Her amazing job is enough to make me consider going back the next time I am in town & for me to give their location a 5 star Yelp rating.

Their portion sizes are incredible. I ordered the fish taco's, which easily could have fed two people. My husband & I both left with to-go boxes. The food was delicious & the drinks were great.  I was a little angry with myself because I ate too much of my dinner & could not order cheesecake! I should have taken some to go. The presentations of the desserts are lovely!"}
{"text":"I have taken advantage of the 4-6 PM Happy Hour food and drink 4x in April 2011 and never felt disappointed. Southwest eggrolls, Chicken Coquettes w/fontina cheese, Avacado Eggrolls, Stuffed Mushrooms in marsala wine sauce. Over 30 items under $6 for HH. That's impressive! Everything was well cooked and delicious. Large, well made drink specials like Long Island Iced Tea $5, pizza for the kids and desserts to make you smile or moan.  A special small plate menu in addition to the HH menu. Many, many choices on the regular menu around $13 which is a bargain in LV.  I met several people who eat there 2-3x a week. This chain is a winner and tops any other I have ever been to. Going to miss it since there is none within 3 hrs of me.  The Rampart location does get crowded but there is plenty of parking although. you may have to walk a block across the parking lot if it is dinner hour. Have not tried the strip location inside Caesars Forum Shopping complex."}
{"text":"Great menu, but very slow service. The drink service is especially slow, even at the bar itself. I think they overextend themselves and aren't always able to keep up with the demand that having such a varied menu requires."}
{"text":"Probably my best dining experience in my young life.  I got the cajun pasta and it was sooooooooo amazing.  The service was awesome and the decor made me feel like I was living the life.  No better way to eat after a Day party in the burning hot sun.  The one downfall is how far of a walk it was but I got over that quickly once I tasted my food.  The cheesecake with macadamia I ordered was nothing less than delicious!"}
{"text":"Want to simply give 6 stars to the bartender who recently moved to the west coast from Miami...  customer service for me and my lady. Showed love to Oakland and even said he would adopt our Raiders if they moved there!

Keep up the great work my brother"}
{"text":"Located deep inside the Forum shopping Arcade in Caesars Palace this place is always a more casual dining treat for us that never disappoints; If only becau of the amusement at the size of the portions! 

The menu is immense, the service efficient and the atmosphere lively. 

The dishes are too numerous and eclectic to recumbent anything specific, but I would recommend you don't have both an app and main course (I promise you, it will be far too much food!), choose one or the other and save yourself for a cheesecake. 

Don't expect haute cuisine, just generously portioned indulgence!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my very favorite restaurants!  My daughter and I normally split a meal and a piece of cheesecake, which keeps the cost down some and leave stuffed, since their portions are big!  We always have great meals here and the cheesecake is to die for - yum!!!"}
{"text":"$7 per slice for a Cheesecake? Okay that's understandable for being at the most expensive commercial real estate on 24st & Camelback in Phoenix. 

What is not excusable is the Moroccan Chicken. The only reason I got in my car a blew $30 on a meal on take out, is because of a video showing how delicious it was. What I got from this location was nothing short of horrible. It looked nothing like what I saw in the video, and on top of that the chicken was so dry I had to chase it down with water just to swallow it. It did not matter that they were generous, giving 3 breasts with the meal, because I could not finish even one. Since I hate wasting food I gave it to my 3 cats, but they would not even eat it, and they love chicken!

I would not have even written this review because I hate bashing businesses, but this place refused to answer my email complaint about the bad meal. At least answer and acknowledge you read it. Next time I'll just go down the road to Chili's. At least they try.."}
{"text":"I like the Cheesecake Factory menu, but the portions, calories, and sodium and fat counts are really too much. I like their happy hour, however."}
{"text":"Generally do a great job but I've got a rant.  You changed the eggplant parm dish.  The new dish is awful.  Please go back to your old preparation.  I'm guessing the new one comes straight from a freezer to the microwave to your table which is the reason for the change.  The previous dish was beautifully prepared.  I liked it so much I had most of my family ordering it as well.  
Lastly, I've enjoyed some very nice meals at the bar.  Can't recall the gal's name but she is a gem and I've gone back just because of her.  
I'm going to give 4 stars as I think you do a good job but you have to fix that eggplant dish."}
{"text":"If I could give this business a zero star rating I definitely would. I got food poisoning from this restaurant when on my lunch break (I work in the forum shops). I ordered salmon and hadn't eaten anything else all day and felt violently sick immediately after. I wrote to the corporate offices online simply to notify them of the incident so that it didn't happen to someone else, I wasn't looking for something free since I don't plan on eating here again.. And they replied with a few questions about how I paid, what I ordered and the date and time which I gladly answered. About a week later I got a letter from them saying that their temperature and refrigeration was up to par and that they won't reimburse me for my meal. Great customer service Cheesecake Factory. Pretty much telling me.. \"Nope you didn't get sick from our food. Have a nice day.\" It's not even about the food, now it's just horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Even though it's a chain, this was the first restaurant (not this one in particular) that my husband and I went to together, so I guess we have a sentimental attachment to it.  I love the luau salad, my husband always gets the bang bang chicken and shrimp.  I always get the strawberry shortcake at the end, it's a huge biscuit filled to the brim with fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and topped with whipped cream.  Even if you normally order cheesecake, try this dessert one day, it's so good!!"}
{"text":"Excelent service. Meat loaf was okay. Cheesecakes were great. Fine Arnold Palmer.It was a goofs spot to rest and get a bite after a long walk"}
{"text":"Service here is great! Amazing strawberry lemonade. I ordered the chicken marsala and was very surprised at the portion size... its HUGE.. they should lower their prices and decrease the portion sizes.. That isn't what subtracts the stars for me... it's the taste of the food... the marsala chicken was bland and dirty tasting... no flavor or anything. What a huge disappointment..."}
{"text":"Se amate davvero il cheesecake, il vostro posto è qui! Con oltre 24 diversi tipi di cheesecake il Cheesecake Factory è un ottimo posto dove gustare l'originale cheesecake Made in USA. Ma il Cheesecake Factory è anche un vero ristorante dove ovviamente troverete tutte pietanze tipiche della cucina statunitense. Assolutamente da provare se siete da queste parti."}
{"text":"Horrible experience waited 70 min for a table then waited an additional 50 min for a child's spaghetti and meatball dinner and the adult meals sat under a warmer and dried out. Ordered a cheese cake for desert and was told the bakery staff were on a change of shift and waited over 20 minutes for a desert!  I can not recommend this place due to slow poor service."}
{"text":"Amazing staff today at the cheesecake factory. The staff came out and sang Happy birthday to our new building a bears. Storm Trooper and Chebaca"}
{"text":"My best friend loves coming here because of the assortment of Cheesecake available.The quality of service and food remains consistent every time we come. Never disappointed with what I order it always works out. One of my favorite appetizers are the lettuce chicken wraps.
 
But forget about getting into this place for any special occasions like Valentine 's or Mother's day. Its literally crowds waiting to get in, you would think the restaurant was giving away cheesecake for free. This place stays active considering it's the only location in Charlotte. I just dislike the long wait to be seated but overall it's a restaurant for a good time with friends and a variety of entrees at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Extremely large menu makes it hard to decide.  The service staff is never very helpful as they are always busy and usually unfamiliar with the menu.  Very pricy but the portions of most dishes are very large.  The desserts are fantastic, but take it out and eat it at home."}
{"text":"Standard cheesecake factory restaurant with typically extra long wait because of the location and the prices tend to be a little higher then usual also due to the fact that it is located I. The heart of Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"Food not as good after the recession. Baja tacos are much smaller. Just not the same. It seemed like the food tasted way better before. Recession is way over. Charging more for less!"}
{"text":"I usually like to go to Cheesecake Factory with a big group because there is something for everyone.  We were seating immediately on Thursday night, which was unusual for me as we normally have to wait for most CFs.  The service was good.  My biggest issue was that the food came out at all different temperatures (my pasta looked like it had been sitting a while).  I have eaten at the CF in Caesars and found the food better but the wait much longer... Trade-offs..."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I have paid multiple visits to cheesecake factory before. The food is diverse and made right most of the time but my visit tonight will be my last. Being a server myself, I understand that it can be complicated in the kitchen but a bad attitude from a server (whose name I don't know since she never bothered to introduce herself), is not acceptable. We started off with the portabella mushroom avocado and zucchini fries which is a staple for us and it was served different than other times but we've become accustomed to getting this dish looking different each time. We also ordered the tostada salad to share. Three iced tea refills later (one of which was the wrong kind of tea), and I had to ask the waitress where our salad was and she informed us that they burnt the tostada and were making a new one. Fifteen minutes later we get the salad which looked more like a bowl of lettuce with nothing else mixed in it. It was clearly missing some of the ingredients. The manager came around and offered to replace the salad with a new one made correctly. After three tries, we were served a simple salad that should've been on the table an hour before. I did my best to be understanding towards the server until she dropped the check off with three salads on there and she had only taken off one of them from the total. Basically they expected me to pay for THEIR mistake. At that point, I had given up on the server and once again asked to see a manager and all he did was take one more salad off and have me pay for the bill as if it was served right at a reasonable time. He never bothered to apologize or try and make up for the inconvenience. Over all it was not a good experience. People do not come to a restaurant to wait around and be treated this way. Restaurants are equally valued for their customer service as they are for their food in my eyes and cheesecake factory failed at both this time. Considering the way management acts around here, I do not think there will be a change made in this restaurant's ways. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Miso Salmon is simply amazzzing!!! Dont have to mention regarding cheescakes! Always busy!!!"}
{"text":"So I'm back in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks and decided to go to cheesecake factory. I mean u can't go wrong with the cheesecake factory, iv been there before it's a safe choice for lunch or dinner.

So anyway we sat down waited 15 mins for our waiter to come just to ask us what would u like to drink while still for our bread to come while need I to remind u that our utensils are soooo dirty we had to ask them for new ones twice until we decided to clean them our selfs and this was for after lunch hours wasnt very busy around 3ish pm place wasnt that packed.

Ok now I ordered the sheperds pie while my mother got the lunch sized vegi pizza with salad my dad got the garlic noodles all the food was \"ok/good\" the garlic noodles were exceptional my shepherds pie was nothing to write home about tho, didnt get a chance to try moms pizza. Also be mindful that I have been here plenty of time and I can't stress this enough that the utensils were this dirty and service was horribly slow every single time. 

So overall
Food 3/5
Service 1/5
Bang for your buck 3/5
Decor 5/5
Cleanliness 1/5 

I considered all these factors in my review"}
{"text":"Having moved to the area, i was excited to go to cheesecake factory. This is my third attempt to eat at their Summerlin location, as the other two attempts have not gone well. There is no service standard what so ever. So last Saturday on October 17th, around 10:30 pm, my girlfriend and i went in. There was nothing going on; as Boca Park dies around 9:30pm all week. We sat in the bar, and were greeted by our server. My gf orders a coffee, i get an iced tea, iced tea came out fine coffee was ice cold. we let the server know. and a new pot was brewed 10 minutes later my girlfriend gets her coffee. While waiting we were ofered bread, complimentary bread is nice, no knives to cut the bread or spread butter though. Well we finally ordered now we have been here for close to 30 minutes, my i get a quesadilla, she gets an omelet. On the first attempt its the wrong order. now the manager comes by, he wants to make sure we have a good experience then you Frankie our experience blew. So now he goes to the kitchen tells us he will make sure everything comes out perfect. The next omelet comes out and is completely raw, with a long black hair through it  So now we have been here for 45 minutes, the ambiance is terrible, the service is terrible the food quality is terrible and now lets hit management. So Frankie comes up to us and deeply apologizes and tells none of his cooks have long black hair, that's all well and good but my girlfrined is blonde. So he then tells us that our bill would be comped and offered us cmplimentary cheese cake. we respectfully declined as we just wanted to leave. I put $15.00 on the table for the server to call it what it is. We walked out and the manager came running out frantically screaming at us as if we skipped out on the bill. NO, FRANKIE, YOU SAID THE BILL WAS COMPED! So we come back into see what this clown was going to charge us with, we then are given a bill from a server who was not even ours telling us this is our bill..   Like i said I have tried this place 3x since I have moved to Vegas and they are horribly ran. Their don't give a shit attitude its Summerlin is horrendous. Frankie has zero customer service! Insteqad of retaining customers, you lost one. Cold Coffee. No knives. Wrong Order. Chased in to the Parking lot but hey we were offered free cheesecake ..lol"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! I ordered some wings without thinking to ask how they were cooked since I am allergic to shellfish. I realized after I had ordered my grilled fish tacos. The serve spoke to the manager and they took it off my bill. What made me love this place more besides the delicious food was that the manager (forgot his name) brought out my plate personally and stated it was totally shellfish free. I really appreciate the fact that he took the time to bring my plate out and acknowledge my special needs. We joked around and he was very nice and accommodating. He was awesome! 
Now on to the food. I love coffee so I know good coffee when I taste it and their caramel macchiato was amazing. The fish tacos were really good and omg the Mac n chz are a must Have! I chose a simple fresh strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  Usually when a place says fresh I don't expect it to be really fresh. But the strawberries taste so fresh and sweet and it all went perfect with the cheesecake. I will definitely be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I loved the fried macaroni balls but unfortunately one of the chicken sliders was undercooked..."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory:  First hand walking into the establishment was beautiful, the ambiances was spectacular.  Then it ended from there.  The bar tender had know idea how to mix drinks.... was our first to kick off the experience at this establishment.  So we asked for the second in charge to give it a try.   The drinks were much better.  Then it went down hill from there!   Really!  The service was horrible, just horrible.  After three drinks we were cut off.  Management was very unprofessionally gave our seats away after waiting for 45 min.  All due to the malfunction of the beeper's did come around announcing our name.  I guess paying the bar tab was too slow for them. The server was slow, after asking four times for new silverware, which was dirty.....finally received a clean set.  Food was slow coming out to our table.  When it did arrive it was not hot.  The flavors where sub par.   None of the food delighted my palate whatsoever.  A return trip here will never happen."}
{"text":"The food is a little too expensive for what it is. It's nothing really special. 

One time I went there the server was amazing the other time not so much. The second time we sat there for 15 minutes before being helped. The guy brought us bread but dropped it off and left so quickly I was unable to tell him we had no plates or silverware. Had to ask another lady cause our server wasn't anywhere near us for the following 20 minutes. 

The cheesecake is great though!"}
{"text":"First timers in USA. Had this twice at the Vegas north premium outlet branch. I think they just opened this new branch as part of their new expansion. We were pleasantly surprised that the Coke were refillable, the portion here were ALL SO HUMONGOUS, we had a hard time finishing our food. We particularly liked the nachos--they were crisp enough, well salted, and huge in size! Prices are reasonable too. We loved the attentive service also. Well recommended for a hearty meal, I think most people will have smth inside the menu to satisfy their craving."}
{"text":"I have to agree with everyone else who has had issues with this particular Cheesecake Factory. I'm a huge fan of the chain and was excited when a location opened close to my work downtown. At this point, though, I can say my co-workers and I will probably never return to this one again.

We were a party of 8 and arrived early, so we beat the entire lunch crowd in terms of getting seated and getting our orders in. When we ordered, I asked the waitress for bread and butter. 10 minutes later, we were all sitting around, still waiting for our bread and butter.

45 minutes after we had ordered, our food was still nowhere to be seen. When the food did begin to come out, it came in waves. Eventually, all but one of us had gotten our food. This was bizzarre because three people at the table had ordered salmon. Two got their salmon, the third was left waiting. It was a solid 7 minutes that we all sat around staring at our food as it grew cold while we waited for the final person to get her meal so we could all start eating. 

The manager did come and appologize for this, and gave her a comped dessert, so that was nice. Another person's salmon ended up being completely burned on the bottom, so that had to go back and the manager her a comped dessert as well. 

We were there for a celebreation, so when it came time to order dessert, several of us ordered cheesecake. I ordered a slice of the Banana Creme Cheesecake. They brought our cheesecakes, and I took one bite of mine and it was FROZEN. At that point, I was so over it I didn't even want to mention it to the waitress, but the rest of my party was fed up and told her as soon as she came over again. She made a face and informed us that the Cheesecakes are all freshly made.

I poked the cheesecake with my fork to demonstrate and it made the classic \"crunch\" sound of a frozen cake, so she took away my cheesecake and was gone for another 10 minutes (this was the trend of the whole meal). When she returned, she asked if I'd like to have strawberry cheesecake instead. I said no thank you, can I please just have another slice of the banana creme? She then informed me that the banana creme was all frozen. So I ended up with no cheesecake.

And all would have been well if that had been the end of it. I'd have left sad and disappointed, but not angry. No, the anger came when I got the bill and saw that my frozen, inedible, cheesecake that I had been forced to cancel was charged on the bill, and then marked as a \"comp.\" Being forced to take back food because it is frozen is not a \"comp, \" that is bad customer service. It is insulting to your customers when you mark food as a \"comp\" when in fact they received nothing. I had one bite of frozen cake and was forced to send it back. You have not done me any favors by not charging me for that cake. That cake should never have been given to me in the first place. 

Overall, the main dishes we did receive were the usual yummy quality of Cheesecake Factory. But getting our bread took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our desserts took forever, and getting our bill took forever. There is a serious managment issue going on with this location that needs to be fixed ASAP."}
{"text":"Sunday at 2:00 pm my wife and I split French country salad and steak Diane, which we often do at this location.  The restaurant was busy but the greeting and the service (Rebecca was our server) was friendly and professional.  Bread came promptly as requested (we requested only dark bread).  Bread was fresh.
The French country salad tasted excellent as usual. However, it was supposed to contain grilled asparagus, which was missing.  The steak Diane was delicious with an ample serving and prepared exactly as I ordered it, medium.  The mashed potatoes were real and excellent.  For dessert we order Linda's Chocolate Cake.  Excellent!  Server, Rebecca, made sure we had extra plates for sharing the meal.  Overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant here in Las Vegas. I eat here at least once or twice a week. I also order take-outs fairly often. The food is always delicious. The menu has a ton of variety, so I never run out of options. The waiters are usually always polite and talkative. Of course, there are a few bad apples here and there but overall, the waiters I've met are great. This location is only 5 mins from my house, so very convenient. Love this restaurant!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We visited Cheesecake Factory yesterday, 9/26, for a late lunch. My daughter's first time there and my last visit was in Houston,Tx 15 yrs ago. I bragged about this place after my last experience of great food and service. But unfortunately, you won't get a good rating from me this time! First I'd like to say our server, Rachelle D. was good, but that's all that was good on our visit!! Food was horrible I asked for hot wings, asked if I can get all flats, they stated they come pre-packed so it's mixed even. I get them and I get almost all drums, which I hate, and 3 flats, so I decide to eat them anyway because I was starving. The taste/ flavor was not good at all, you couldn't taste any spice or flavor, because all you can taste is the \"overload of salt\" on them and they appeared to be burned under the sauce. So after one bite I sent them back and got the pot stickers like my daughter got and they weren't too impressive either, I ate only two! Then the spinach dip with chips and \"salsa\" came and that was gross, very oily and stale chips and the \"salsa\" was in fact \"pico\" which is NOT salsa! When manager came over because I sent wings back I got, \"oh I am sorry and took them off bill\" and when I mentioned the \"salsa\" being pico, she states, \"oh, that's our salsa that's how we make it, it's not really spicy\" so I said it's not really salsa either that's pico! So over all our experience was not good at all and we will not be returning! Horrible over priced food....such a disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could have rated this place higher. If I was rating just the food, I would have given it 4 stars.  But, that's not how it works!

I went with my friend after our horrible experience at Aquae Sulis spa.  We  both had mint green teas and the lunch-sized cobb salad.

The mint tea was fantastic.  The salads were huge for a lunch size, and the ingredients were fresh and cold. I like that there was no fat at all on the chicken.  The dressing could have used a bit more flavor.

To finish, friend had the carrot cake cheesecake, I had the red velvet cheesecake (which I love!!).  We both left very happy with our desserts!!

Unfortunately, the service was pretty lackluster.  It took forever for her to stop by the table to take orders, refill drinks, pick up plates, bring the check, return the check, etc.

Maybe she was just having an off day, but like I said, if it hadn't been for the slow service I would have rated 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites across the board due to the consistency of the food and service. Tonight I ordered the fried cheese starter platter, soup du jour (tortilla), and the Chicken and Biscuit entree. Let me start off but saying the fried cheese was excellent, about 8 little triangles perfectly breaded and crisped with Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses and melted to perfection. They were the perfect temperature. The soup was so-so, a basic bisque like consistency with corn and some other veggies. It had a nice spicy finish but at first bite the saltiness is a little  overwhelming. The entree is one of my favorite a good solid buttermilk biscuit, very flaky and buttery, with a vegetable melange (carrots were slightly undercooked) , mushrooms, and peas. The chicken however was moist and juicy, pan seared to perfection. It also had just the right amount of rosemary crust. And the gravy that they use is fantastic, not to rich or thick, and not overly seasoned. That's what I like about this entree it's not overly done so you can really enjoy each component. And our server, Nick, totally professional and nice and a real babe. Over all a great experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory and have been eating at different ones religiously throughout the years, but my experience at this location was a gigantic disappoint, to say the least. 

When I suggested The Cheesecake Factory to one of my friends, he said that the food wasn't great and overpriced at that. Since this has always been one of my favorite places to go, of course I had to argue with him. Determined to prove him wrong, I insisted that we go here for dinner.

We went in, put our name down on the wait list, and went outside for a cigarette. Now this is a normal practice, and typically restaurant hosts will always check outside for the next table to be seated if nobody answers their call from inside, especially if the waiting area inside is full! They didn't even try to look for us when we were literally standing just outside of the door (which we had also let the hostess know before stepping out), and it took a leaving customer to inform us that we were up for a table. We ended up having to sit outside because they sat somebody else at our table.

Our waitress was friendly (which was the only pro of the night). I ordered a rare steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. When the food came out, my steak was COLD. Not even room temperature, but cold. When I informed our waitress, she had the audacity to tell me that in order for them to cook it rare, they could only throw it on the grill for a couple seconds which meant that it was normal for it to be cold. Are you seriously kidding me? I don't ever eat anything BUT rare steak, and I have yet gone to a restaurant and been served a cold one. Furthermore, if you don't know how the steak Diane at The Cheesecake Factory is, the steak is actually thinly sliced into little pieces, about three inches in diameter. So it doesn't take much for the meat to get heated up. As a reference, I have ordered this dish before at several other Cheesecake Factories, and not once have I encountered this problem. 

At this point I was just bummed out, but my friend insisted on complaining to the manager, so that's who we asked for. It was a good 15 minutes before anybody walked past us or any of the tables around. We had to asked for a manager twice before our waitress came back with my steak re-cooked. The manager lingered in the background behind her and they both left after she gave me my steak. At this point we just asked for the check and a to-go box since our appetites were gone. I didn't even bother checking my steak to see if it was any good this time around.

I didn't bother mentioning, but my herb crusted salmon was exceptionally bland. I had to season the life into it with salt and pepper myself. At least it was decently cooked, and with how they treated my steak, I didn't even want to complain about anything else. I don't remember what my date had to eat, but it's safe to say that we were just as impressed with his dish as we were with mine, which was not at all.

I'm a very easy-going and forgiving person, so for me the big issue isn't necessarily the poor cooking, but the service and management (as I've seen other reviewers have pointed out). They should have just fixed the problem when it was presented, instead of making excuses. We were not being rude or unfriendly (in fact quite the opposite, despite of everything) and it's not like I was asking for the meal to be comped or discounted. In addition, I've never seen worse management skills. The manager never bothered to introduce himself or ask us how we were doing, even though we had specifically asked for him. Everything was a huge hassle and they made me feel like I was someone who was super picky or asking too much.

My friend is right in that The Cheesecake Factory is a relatively pricey place to eat and based on my experience at this location, it is definitely not worth it. Worst $50 of my life, which doesn't even include tax and tip. It's a good thing our waitress was at least friendly and smiled through the night, because her other service skills were quite lacking. I don't even know how the manager was hired, because he showed no managerial skills whatsoever. I was so embarrassed that I insisted on going to eat here and defended this place when everything turned out to be horrible. 

This particular Cheesecake Factory is definitely not up to par. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here. Told it would be a 30 min wait for a table, 50 min later checked in and still waited 10 more minutes to sit down. Waitstaff was good with checking in, but our meal took 1.5 hours to get a salad and a steak. It wasn't the steak that was the hold up.. but the salad. Specifically the onions on the salad. I never received the onions after I asked for them to bring it out without them. My poor fiancés steak was lightly warm from being under the heat lamps waiting on my onions. In the past I have LOVED The Cheesecake Factory but I won't be dining with them. From now on it's Cheesecake to go-if at all."}
{"text":"Went here with three family members while on vacation. We shared two nachos orders and now we all have food poisoning. Not how I imagined spending my time in Vegas! Needless to say I don't recommend eating at this location."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory - My love restaurant in US!  They are always busy and long line up.  Reasons pricing and full menu.  Die for their cheesecake.  Our server is good, and very attentive.  Ordered CRISPY CRAB WONTONS, and they are soooooo tasty and crispy.  Also try their Factory Burger, with Sweet Potato fries.  A little disappointed as the charbroiled beef patty is a bit dry and they don`t come with any sauce inside the burger.  Love their BAJA CHICKEN TACOS, Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Tomato, Avocado, Onion, Chipotle and Cilantro."}
{"text":"Granted it was the grand opening, but the service was amazing and the food...three words...OH...MY...GAWD...run, don't walk, to this place for dinner!"}
{"text":"Don't come here! My 9 year old daughter begged us to take her here for her birthday. They won't take reservations. We came at 6pm and they didn't seat us until 8pm. Then they crammed 11 of us into the space of 8 outside after them temperature had dropped 15 degrees. They couldn't move the heaters to our table because other customers were complaining of the cold. Over priced and mediocre food to top it all off. My family will never come back."}
{"text":"Mmm LOVE this place.  We went on a saturday evening and waited about 20 minutes, which wasn't all bad.  Asked for a high chair and the hostess ignored me so we went without..made for a fun dinner with a 2 year old! LOL

Anyway, hubby got fish tacos which were amazing, would have preferred the fish to be a bit more seasoned.  The black beans were great.  I got a chicken club sandwich and a side salad.  Both were out of this world great!!!  Side salad is really big.  I took half of my sandwich home.  Baby got corn dogs, pretty good.... he really liked the diced fruit we ordered instead of fries.

Got the kahlua cheesecake which was awesome!!!  Overall wasn't too pricey - I think we spent around $41 and that was a lot of food."}
{"text":"Went with my mother for a nice meal.  Unfortunately although the food appeared good from afar, the meal I ordered with chicken and shrimp had extremely raw shrimp.  I was barely cooked and was still gray without a hint of orange indicating it was cooked.  Basically it was barely heated.  I brought it to the attention of the server who told the manager.  The manager came over and apologized and did not charge for my entree.  However, the serving of seafood in this manner was incredibly unsafe and it really was inexcusable to be plated and served."}
{"text":"Der köstlichste und gleichzeitig wohl gehaltvollste Käsekuchen in  so scheint es mir -mindestens 100 Varianten, den ich jemals gekostet habe! Leider gibt es die Cheesecake Factory nur in den Staaten.
Jaaaaa, hierfür irre ich durch die extrem unübersichtlich langen Wege der Shopping Mall des Cesars Palace!!
Endlich angekommen, warten wir, bis wir platziert werden. Da es hier wie immer ziemlich voll ist.
Für ca. 7 Dollar erhalte ich ein meist sehr hoch aufgetürmtes, sehr geschmacksintensives (je nach Sorte: schokoladig, nussig, fruchtig) Stück großartigen Käsekuchen. Als ob das noch nicht reichte, gesellt sich auf den Teller bzw. in die Box zum Mitnehmen noch ein Sahnehäubchen.
Bisher habe ich meinen Kuchen nicht geschafft, allein im Schokokringel obendrauf ist wahrscheinlich schon eine ganze Tafel Schokolade verschwunden.
Nebenbei bemerkt, die Cheesecake Factory bietet nicht nur Kuchen und Torten an, sondern auch eine horrende Auswahl verschiedenster Speisen (Pasta, Fisch, Meeresfrüchte, Fleisch, Salate, Sandwiches, Omelettes, Eiscreme, Desserts, heiße und kalte sowie alkoholische Getränke. Das alles habe ich aber leider nicht probieren können, weil ich das Dessert eben schon als Starter hatte :-)"}
{"text":"I was very fond of this place until last night! I ordered a cosmo and to my horror I found a really big piece of glass in my drink. How did they handle this? The manager comes along and apologizes for his mistake, informs us that he will return to get some personal information incase something goes wrong and needs medical attention. Never stops by! Thanks to my server for being honest and confirming it was a glass piece. At least she was honest enough.
Another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes-there were broken glass pieces on the floor- one of the servers kicks them like he was playing soccer in his own field.  Smiles and walks by! Really?? Were they going to wait for the worst to happen! 
How does the management handle both these situations apart from bringing this to their attention? They don't!! Just ignored it!!
Had I cut my mouth or my tongue- they would have taken actions? What if I had consumed small glass pieces in my drink? Is the solution to these incidents to ignore them and console us by paying our bill? No. I'm really disappointed with them. And will always think twice before walking in there."}
{"text":"Love The Cheesecake factory! Their Steak Diane melts in your mouth, good quality and excellent mashed taters! The setting is romantic and elegant. Very nice atmosphere and you get superior service! This location at Ceasars is fun and relaxing, better than the other two locations!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times in the past, but I've never experienced what I experienced yesterday. After being in the nearby Apple Store for about 3 hours, my friend and I decided to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated fairly quickly, which was great, but our seat was in a super small corner and very close to the the table next to us, so we opted to sit at the bar. This is where the trouble came in. 

The bartender first poured us water and took our drink order. When he placed the water down, he slammed the cups in front of us. We thought very little of it initially. Next, he delivered the drinks and walked away without saying anything about food, which we had previously told him we would be ordering. We called him back to order. My friend ordered a pasta dish and asked for extra sauce to be poured in. He replied, \"No.\" We were confused and actually thought he was joking, but he said \"no you can not\" again. She asked why and he explained that many people ask for it and it comes out too soupy and he \"wasn't about to send any food back because it was too soupy.\" Then he called out to someone else (another employee) and walked away. He poured a glass of red wine for another customer then He came back and pointed to me and asked what I wanted to eat, but he hadn't resolved the soupy pasta issue with my friend. We had decided that we didn't like his attitude or the way he yelled out to someone and walked away in the middle of taking our order so we decided that we would enjoy the meal at a different Cheesecake Factory. I told him that we wouldn't be eating here and that we were leaving. He took the receipt for the drinks slid it in front of us and said \"don't forget to pay for these.\" We hadn't had one sip of our drinks. We asked to speak to the manager because we didn't want to walk out and have it look like we skipped out on a bill. The manager was understanding, but not apologetic, and told us that we wouldn't have pay for the drinks that we never touched. 

We left, went to the Cheesecake Factory in the district at Green Valley, had a fantastic meal and even greater service."}
{"text":"They need to update their page bcuz it
Says they take Reservations but when u call they refuse"}
{"text":"Sad to write this.  Was there last week and sat at the bar.  The service was excellent the bartender was on it! Even though they were super busy she was awesome.  My problem was with the aftermath.  I had the jambalaya which I always have.  We look for cheesecake factories so I can eat it.

While eating the chicken and shrimp both tasted a little bit \"off\" I thought maybe it was the cajun seasoning (this one was more seasoned than the usual ones) well it wasn't I was up all night puking not the best way to spend our last night in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just was snapped at by the hostess for asking why I couldn't get a buzzer while waiting for a table. Wanted to browse at LL Bean. Was told very testily it was because they \"weren't on a long wait!!!\". Didn't appreciate the attitude. Was also told they do not send texts. So basically, \"Too bad, stand in line.\". What kind of customer service is that??"}
{"text":"OK, it took me a while to finally visit this restaurant and I had to get a gift card to go...I have good intuition about places. Come to find out I was right on the money, this place sucks!

First off, don't serve Mexican food if you have no idea how it is made. I should have known better than to order the chicken enchiladas but hey, I felt daring. This ridiculous small amount of food was a joke. They have no idea how chipotle or cilantro is used. The rice was doused in so much cilantro it would have gagged Speedy Gonzoles, Their chipotle sauce used on the enchiladas tasted canned and the side of black beans were undercooked, not al dente, undercooked.

The plate was about $14, I have no idea how much my Shirley Temple was but it must have been a lot since I only ordered a slice of cheesacake to go and the whole thing, with tip (I left 15%, crappy service) was $32! I suppose to some people that's not a lot, but to someone who actually WORKS for a living this is outrageous especially for the quality of food one recieves. I think it also imporatant to mention my stomach hurt that night when I got home, and I normally have an iron stomach.

It only got one star because it doesn't give the option for NO star.

Bad show."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Have not had a bad experience here yet. I come here with my friends all the time. The prices are really reasonable . For about $32 I got the fried macaroni balls , chicken picata  and a chocolate cake. The portions are huge. I always have so much left overs.The chicken Picata is always on point . Very moist, tasty, fresh, and hot. The servers are always very friendly also. They always made sure I was ok and filled my drinks on a timely manner. This is always my go to place when you family comes to visit. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cheesecake is in the name of the restaurant . You know this place is going to be good. Although I try and stray away from chain restaurants this once you truly can't miss. They literally have everything on their menu. This can be a blessing and a curse. There are so many amazing options it can be hard
To decide. What I can tell you is this.

The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is amaze. It's Parmesan crusted chicken served over pasta with a spicy New Orleans sauce. The portion in my opinion
Is pretty large. So you could share. 

My absolute favorite however is
The stuffed mushrooms. Mmmm. Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce. Some times when I eat
It I want to tell the waiter I love him just for bringing me the stuffed mushrooms that I ordered...but at that point in our relationship we've only
Known eachother for about
20 min so maybe thats to soon to take
That step. 

They also have amazing soups. I seriously doubt you can go wrong with one.

Now for all of you calorie counters. There's is a menu to make
You feel a little
Less guilty. It is called the \"Skinnylicious\" Menu. It's basically menu full of food saying \" eat me I have not
Cream or butter.\" 

Cheesecake has something for everybody. It's an excellent
Place for a group. It is
Pricier but manageable.

My Tip:
GET THE CHEESECAKE. It's called the Cheesecake Factory for crying out Loud. It is simply not  to say no to a slice. I suggest the red velvet if you really feel in the mood To have a relationship with a cake. It's literally to die for. Not an
Exaggeration ."}
{"text":"My sister and I come all the time for Sunday brunch and I am a fan. One thing I enjoy about Cheesecake Factory is their complimentary bread basket, including a sweet, wheat bread and a crispy sourdough. The warm bread is a great started before our meal. 

Our usual order is the Bruleed French Toast ( $10.50) and the Spinach and Mushroom Omelette ($11.95). The French Toast is huge and so good! The outside is crisp, whereas, the inside is light and fluffy. It comes with one strawberry on top (why not more strawberries?!?!?), with great syrup. 

The omelette is fluffy, stuffed with excellent sautéed mushroom and spinach. The omelet also comes with toast and country-style fries. The omelet is served all day, whereas the french toast is only served on the brunch menu (from 10:00am- 2:00pm). 

I also love their cheesecake. I have tried the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, Fresh Strawberry, and Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake ($7.95/slice). You can't go wrong with any flavor! 

Cheesecake Factory is usually a go-to for dinner, but I prefer their Sunday Brunch menu. Definitely try the brunch here and don't forget to grab a slice of cheesecake on your way out!"}
{"text":"Overall, this visit was doodie. We were a party of 5 for a bday dinner, not mine, FYI, Our wait was stated to be 20 minutes but it was more like 45. Waitress was great but food and dessert was very disappointing. Tried a few chicken entrees and very average at best that night. Our cocktails tasted like dirty dishwater and I was not alone in that thinking. Big fan of cheesecake and sweets in general. Tried the new nutella cheesecake but should have stuck with the classic. For the wait and the price, it should have been much better."}
{"text":"My son asks the waiters why they don't have any \"fun menus that you draw on\" and the guy was awesome and pulled some paper out and gave him a pen to draw with. Any person that goes out of their way for my child is amazing. I'll update with a name."}
{"text":"My niece picked this for her birthday dinner. Called for a rezzie - no reservations, come in and wait.Sis planned for 7:30 on a Sat. I arrived at 7, anticipating a short wait. The wait was quoted as 75-90 min. I only waited because this was a birthday choice. Waiting area was very crowded, busy with take-out, but then a party allowed their children to sit in the middle of the entrance/exit aisle - smh.....
Sis approached hostess stand at 73 minuted point(hostess quoted time)and was told in a rather surly manner that tables were running on time as quoted and we would be a few more minutes. We were seated around the 90 minute mark - I didn't check quote time. 
Server was very prompt, knowledgeable and friendly. He did a very good job and was rewarded well for his service. 
The food is just awful. Deep fried Man & Cheese was cold in the center, crispy Cuban rolls were hot throughout and crisp on the outside but doughy. Crab & artichoke dip was very strong/fishy flavour. 
Entrees were not much better. Bang Bang Shrimp & Chicken lacked any bang, lukewarm, Chicken Chile was OK.......Factory chopped salad looked as though it had been factory produced - rather than chopped, it looked masticated, almost crushed and runny. One party member had Eggplant parm with some unidentifiable spag type side(zucchini pasta???) that was cold, unsauced and a little congealed.
We didn't complain about anything as we had already waited 1 1/2 hours to eat. Not worth an additional wait or the dreaded manager visit to the table.
Cheesecakes were very good. The rest of the party LOVED them. It's just not my thing.
Again, the server was great, but I don't really feel the food was worth it. The food rates somewhere on the lower end of mediocrity. I don't understand the attraction."}
{"text":"We chose The Cheesecake Factory to entertain our  out of town guests today,  and were EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!

Complaints: It took over an hour to get our lunch of sandwiches and salads... the salads did not come out first as requested....they served the food one plate at a time over a15 minute period so we were not eating together. ....  and we still did not have the coffee we ordered by the time our food came out. 

 We went to the restaurant about 2 in the afternoon between the lunch and supper rush. The restaurant was not busy,  and many tables were available.  We were told we'd be seated in about 5 minutes.  At 2:20 they finally gave us a table. We ordered quickly as there was a plane to catch.  Our meals were simple.  Beef a jus sandwich,  chicken Caesar salad,  grilled chicken dinner with salad, and a club sandwich with a salad. 

At 2:55 I asked to speak with a manager as our salads were not out yet and we still had not received our coffee.. At at 3:10 they brought the chicken dinner and salad out together.  At 3:15 they brought out the Ceasar salad and club sandwich.  Several minutes later they brought out the beef sandwich and the salad that went with the club sandwich. 

Needless to say we did not have time to eat all of our food or drink the coffee. The manager came over and asked if we wanted a cheesecake.  I said,  are you kidding me?  No,  we don't even have time to eat or meal.  We have to leave.  He said, \"I'm sorry if you feel we did something wrong.  If you want to order cheesecake,  it can be packaged to go. \" My sister and I were speechless that he would try to sell us more. 

 If you want a good meal with good service in a timely manner,  do not go to this restaurant.  It was $28.68 for 2 glasses of wine and a virgin daiquiri while we waited to be seated,  and $66 for sandwiches and salads for 4 people with 2 cups of coffee. The manager never offered any discount on this $95.00 lunch,  not even on the coffee that we didn't get to drink,  and his apology was as lacking as the poor service.  He didn't apologize for bad service or a failure to get our salads out before our meal.  He said he was sorry that WE FELT they did something wrong.  I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone, or eat at another cheesecake factory.  They lost 4 customers today as will as any guests we might have brought them."}
{"text":"Was a bit disappointed when the food came wasn't what I expected but very good. Waiter was nice and didn't bug. I love wait staff that don't linger.  Don't recommend the booths by the kitchen,much louder than wanted for a date night conversation.. Reese's cheese cake is very good. Yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food and the cheesecake is to die for!!! Try the meatloaf."}
{"text":"Went here the day before my birthday with my boyfriend, everything was delicious as usual. Probably the first time I didnt have a vey nice server, he was kind of distant, but he was on top of things for the most part, normally the servers ask if we re celebrating something but he didnt, not did he ask if we wanted an appetizer. We sat for a long time, being a server I can see how that can be a little annoying but we did leave him a 35% tip."}
{"text":"Haven't been in awhile and on our last vacation took the family. love the surroundings and food although portions are large! Great to to place."}
{"text":"Careful eating here - This Cheesecake Factory gave me and my wife food poisoning from Chinese Chicken Salad, undercooked chicken or workers handling lettuce. Either way it has a history of unsanitary violations."}
{"text":"Unless you're eating out during a snowstorm or the Super Bowl, if you show up during a typical meal shift, it's common to wait up to an hour to be seated (sign in and go stroll the stores and outdoor kiosks while you wait). It's a fun atmosphere with good service, so this  restaurant is always busy. One of our visits included a large group, and we arrived at the early side of the dinner hour. Despite the fact that Cheesecake Factories don't take reservations, we were soon seated and our servers did a great job managing a large party. Menu items as listed tend toward calorie-rich, but servers are perfectly willing to adjust entrees to your specifications, and with an entire Skinnylicious menu, it's easy to make even those entrees even healthier."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely terrible. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday afternoon and we still had to wait about an hour for a table. The food was a complete disappointment.  Our server was the nicest part of the entire experience. Overall, I do not recommend it. I suggest going to maggianos instead."}
{"text":"I went into the Cheesecake Factory and was very skeptical. I had never been and had no idea if it was going to be worth while or not. I sat down and had dinner with my husband and was pleasantly surprised. I liked the food but the best part about our experience was our server. Monica was not only extremely knowledgeable about the menu but also attentive and funny!!! My husband and I both laughed, ate and had a great time. I would come back here for her if nothing else! We had a blast."}
{"text":"Being on a diet, I decided to try their skinnylicious menu.  All items on that menu are under 590 calories.  I tried the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp, served with angel hair pasta and asparagus.  It was wonderful.  There were 6 large shrimp cooked to perfection, the pasta and lemon garlic sauce was very good, not overpowering at all.  I was skeptical at first because when many restaurants try to create a diet friendly menu they almost always forget to keep the food with taste.  Not the case here, this was well done.  This was definitely helpful to my diet at mealtime, especially since I blew it having the pineapple upside down cheesecake for dessert.  Come one, who can go to the cheesecake factory and not have a piece of cheesecake."}
{"text":"I love the food at this restaurant and have been there quite a few times. However, my last experience there was disturbing and I experienced the worst service I've ever had in my entire life. First of all we were told it was a 40 min wait. That was fine, we waited. After we got seated, we were there for 2 1/2 hours!!! And all we ordered was dinner. No appetizers, no dessert, no cocktails (well my friend had one cocktail, that's it.)  Our waiter, Joe was not attentive to us at all. Im guessing its because we ordered water for our drinks and we are in our early 20's so he probably assumed we weren't going to tip well. (were all in the service industry and usually tip between 20-30%, little did he know). He tended to every single table around us and would look at us and then walk away. He looked at us and walked away more than 8 times, to the point when we finally got our food wrapped and he asked if we wanted dessert we said no because we didn't want to wait another hour and decided it would be faster to go to the dessert bar and get it ourselves. The only person that was attentive but not in a good way, was the bus boy who tried to take our plates 5 mintues after we started eating. By the time we left I was so annoyed that I dont care how good the food is I wont go back. The most disturbing part, however, to this whole expierence was I actually witnessed a bus boy drop clean silverware on the floor, pick it up, and put it back to be rolled up as if it were still clean. THAT'S DISGUSTING!!!! Im appalled that this is supposed to be a high class restaurant but yet has the worst service and is dirty."}
{"text":"Always have had great service here. The nachos and avocado egg rolls are so yummy! Little to no wait time even on a weekend night."}
{"text":"I ordered the Beef Medallions off of the Skinnylicious menu and it was so not worth the money. I understand they want to keep the calories low, but 4 small pieces of beef and less than a forkful of mashed potatoes was not worth $17.50. The manager was a complete jerk when I talked to him about it. Buyer beware on that menu item."}
{"text":"Had the Cheese Cake to go.
They were friendly and courteous.
The Cheese Cake was consistent.
The whip cream was fresh.

Everyone liked it but it would appear our French friends didn't like the peanut butter cheese cake.  I guess it's too rich for them."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a few friends around midnight (so they weren't busy at all) I was disappointed with the food first I ordered the Dynamite Shrimp the shrimp was WAY too over fried that I had to peel off the fried part and just eat the shrimp also the sauce that came with made me & my husbands stomach hurt. We also ordered the Louisiana Pasta which we had to send back to the kitchen because there was almost no sauce on the pasta. Salads were good but I asked for the smallest caesar &  she ended up bringing & charging me for the bigger one. We had to ask for lemons for our water 4 times before finally getting them. I do love Cheesecake Factory but last night I wasn't happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Bad service, filthy tables and undercooked food. The staff was frantic in a near-empty restaurant and they seemed perturbed when we complained about our disgusting uncleaned table. They eventually moved us to a booth and changed our server to one who was less distracted. I could see our old table from our new one and the staff proceeded to refold our handled napkins and left everything the way it was for the next unwitting customer. Our plates were dirty on the new table and the food we received was not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. There is something everyone can find on the menu. The Cheesecake was amazing. I had an apple Cheesecake and it was so good. The portions are so big that you always have food to take home and eat for the next day. We were seated quickly and got our meal quickly. 

There was a little something wrong with my mahi mahi dinner and the manager immediately took it off the bill. BTW. I ended up exchanging and eating the fish and chips and they were great."}
{"text":"I've had Cheesecake Factory numerous times but this is the first at this location. HORRIBLE! I first wallK in and I'm not even greeted. The hostess doesn't even acknowledge me and continues to do what ever she was doing. After what seemed to be a minute (just as I was going to walk out) she finally looks up and doesnt say a word! Mute are we?! I have to initiate the conversation. My server was nice but i think she forgot about me once my food came out but no worries. I dont need the attention. As for the food... UGH! Horrible. Ordered the carbonara with chicken and it was bland! The noodles were soggy and the chicken was boiled and was dry. I probably used a tablespoon of salt just to add flavor. The table next to me had his server take his dish back. He ordered a pasta dish and it had no sauce! It had that look when the noodles sit out of the water for to long look. I'm not knocking Cheesecake Factory... just this location. AVOID IF YOU CAN!"}
{"text":"Tonight my brother in law went to get our family dinner from here, and I must say it was a big disappointment.. Normally we eat there and have really good service, but tonight we decided to order and take out. To start off the charges us for the bread when I thought it came free with the meals but I'm not sure about that one. Also we ordered tacos and the side we decided on was rice and corn NO BEANS, and they gave us rice and beans. On that note it was also cold.. And then my dad ordered fish and chips and instead of coleslaw he asked for double fries and they didn't give him that, they gave him coleslaw... And the last thing was my mom ordered steak medallions on the skinnylicious menu and they're was literally barely anything on that plate. This entire experience was just so upsetting and I hope you tell your location staff to next listen to what we ask for next time. Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"Garbage.  And this review is for both the Crocker Park, and Lyndhurst locations.  Also, I had the same experience in Miami, FL...must be a cheesecake factory thing!

I order the same damn thing every time, and they can never get the order prepped right.  I get the buffalo chicken sandwich.  It is either over cooked (with crunchy fried bits of who knows what that nearly crack my teeth), undercooked, over salted fries, or less fries.  

A few times when I ordered some ice cream dessert, there was cellophane wrapping in the ice cream.  What a way to end dinner than flossing with free cellophane :/

I'll take my business to local non chain restaurants and skip your over priced garbage.  I learned my lession, and will think twice when going to chain restaurants.  Local independent restaurants is where it's at!

EEEEEK!  METHINKS NOT!"}
{"text":"Our server Georgina, took our drink orders and left. When she returned, she had forgotten to bring a tea for one of our party. Moments later, holding a tray with a cleaning rag on it, she dropped the tray just beside me and splashed both myself, and my friend sitting next to me. I absorbed most of the splatter, in my mouth, left eye, and face. She fortunately was only splashed on her body and hand. Georgina didn't even say anything to us, but picked up the tray and kept going. After a few moments of waiting, I got up and went to the restroom to clean myself off, since I didn't even have a place setting or napkin at the table. On the way back, I stopped and asked to speak with a manager. A young man with curly hair, and square framed glasses was brought to me and didn't give me his name. I told him our situation, and what had happened. I told him I could not only smell, but also taste the cleaning solution that had been on the rag and tray. At first I asked if it was bleach based, and he assured me it wasn't. Then he said he'd talk to our server, and left things at that by turning around to talk to the hostesses. Clearly, I was dismissed. So I returned to the table, disgusted, upset, and smelling of cleaning solution. My appetite was ruined at this point, so I choose not to order anything. Having chemicals splashed into your mouth, even a few droplets, will do that to a person. At this point, our friend STILL hadn't received his iced tea. We flagged down a passing server and asked her if she could bring it for him. She went back, and came out with the wrong tea. Now in this, I say it wasn't really her fault. She wasn't our server, and didn't know what type he had asked for. Correcting that issue was minor. Next up, comes our long wait for our orders to be brought out. Georgina hasn't been back to our table for at least 15 minutes at this point. Another young man stopped and dropped one basket of bread and a small dish with 4 butter pats, to serve a group of 7. Another long wait, and the table next to us, who were seated after us, and ordered after us, gets their meals. At this point, my left eye was feeling irritated, and I went to flush it out in the men's room with water as best I could. When I returned to the table, our orders were just coming out. And my roommates order was wrong. He had ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp, and NO asparagus. And he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles. At this point, he notified the food runner who had brought his dish that it was wrong. The young man said sorry, and then walked away without offering to replace or fix the order. he decided to just pick out the asparagus, and deal with it since he was hungry, and didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes. At this point, Georgina has appeared at our table 4 times total. While refilling glassing, she is reaching directly in front of my roommates mothers face, my face, and our friend seated on the other side of the booth. No excuse me, no words at all, and STILL no apology from her for the splashing. While my friends ate, I again went to the restroom to flush my eye. I again stopped to speak with the manager from earlier, and asked him for the name of the chemical used for cleaning. He immediately told me that \"I already told you sir that we do not use bleach products here.\" He furthermore told me that he had spoken to our server, and she said she didn't have any cleaning solution or rags with her when she dropped her tray. Outright calling me a liar as I see things. Please take into account, from the beginning I told the manager I didn't want anything, and wasn't asking for free meals, or drinks, or desert etc. I simply wanted the name of the chemicals used, so that I could give that information to a doctor if I felt the need to seek out treatment. He informed me that they didn't use chemicals for cleaning, and then said they used a sanitation solution. I'm sorry, but that would be a chemical. I pointed that out, and told him I was very upset with how this had all been handled. I made it clear again, that I wasn't looking for anything from him, except the name of the chemical. He asked if there was anything he could do to make my evening better, covering my meal or anything. I once more told him that I had chosen NOT to eat, after getting splashed and having that rancid taste of chemicals in my mouth. He then said he would get me the name of the solution used, after my having exhausted every other avenue, and telling him I would be contacting the corporate office. At this point, I told him I was done with the conversation, and wanted nothing more to do with him, as he clearly didn't care about the situation. The rest of our evening was spent with little service from Georgina. She had come and taken a desert order from our group while I was speaking with the manager, without even asking if I had wanted anything. Granted, I didn't. She didn't speak a word to me the entire time after the first complaint, and treated"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants, so the utter disappointment with our visit there last night really makes me sad. We didn't have to wait to be seated which is really surprising since this place is always packed. The hostess showed us to our table, and as we were sitting down, a waitress very rudely came to the table and told the hostess that someone was already sitting there. The hostess said it was okay to sit there anyway, so my boyfriend and I started looking at the menu. The waitress who said that someone was already sitting there was literally giving us the evil eye. The hostess came back a few minutes later and asked us if we would mind moving to another booth because there were other people who were waiting for that booth first. If that was the only problem we had, I wouldn't be writing this review, but it got worse from there. 

Our waitress was very nice and pleasant, and she in no way contributed to our horrible experience. We ordered our food at 6:45pm. I ordered the chicken maderia and my boyfriend ordered the Moroccan chicken. We waited and waited for our food, and at 7:15 a manager came to our table and said that an \"overwhelming amount of people ordered pasta\" and because the Moroccan chicken came with kous kous, our food would be delayed. She said something like 300 people ordered pasta and the kitchen couldn't keep up. I've never heard of this happening before. She said it would be a little longer until we got our food, but it ended up being another half an hour before our food came. I'm sorry, but waiting an hour for 2 meals is not acceptable. My boyfriend said his meal was terrible and was not worth waiting an hour for. Needless to say, we won't be back to this location and probably to the Cheesecake Factory at all."}
{"text":"Horrible experience- when you get seated two tables away facing the kitchen you get to see as meals come out from the kitchen. Watched as my shrimp gf pasta sat under the lights. Waitress came and refilled drinks- food still sat-waitress cleaned up bread/butter from table- meal still sat. Watched other wait staff slide dish to side time and time again. Waitress brings out one of three of our orders and my dish still sat halfway under light. Watched as they finally brought it out- cold shrimp- gf pasta was cold and had sat so long if absorbed all sauce. Called back waitress - she didn't even bother to look surprised- she knew- shame on waitress for even serving. My husbands fish tacos apparently sat next to mine as his came out cold too.  Ordered salad to replace the dish thinking it would be faster- arrived when others were done with their meals. Kitchen staff cant get meals out at same time, Food was lousy, over priced for quality and service was beyond poor. Cant believe my husband even tipped. This was the first time back in about six months as the food was mediocre then- figured we would give it another chance- don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"I lost a key and it was returned to an employee at Cheesecake Factory after asking the manager to locate the employee barely attempted to help me. I waited patiently for 2hrs in the 2hrs I asked him once more to check he said he made an announcement and that's all he could do. Another employee saw me there for so long and asked if I needed help. 2 mins later the same manager approaches me and tells me that he can't go around asking all his employees that match the description I gave him and at this point I was being a distraction. I explained it was my car key and I can't leave without it and he said there is nothing he can do. I went to the security office and they had to pull it up on camera walk me across the entire mall and tell another mangager that it was given to an employee on camera and voila the 2nd manager finds my key in under 2 minutes. The 1st manager clearly didn't have the time or patience to deal with my issue. He has a very impatient demeanour and an extreme lack of empathy for absolutely no reason. People like him should be in a position of authority. He was the most unpleasant manager I have ever had to deal with and I wouldn't spend 1$ in the establishment while someone like that is employed."}
{"text":"Dissapointing. Food took way too long. Server could care less if we were there or not. Food alopped on the plate. Not a usual experience with this Chain. Madison Cheesecake needs to step it up."}
{"text":"So happy to see their wait staff change from all white top to bottom to now just a white shirt, tie, black pants and black shoes. Not sure why in the world they made their staff where all white at one time....it was not clean at all....it was actually disgusting seeing them especially their shoes all dingy from their floors....ok rant over, now on to my review for the evening.

Arrived at 9pm for dessert and coffee with the family. We were seated immediately, with waters only moments later.

We all ordered cheesecake and coffee. My favorite is the tuxedo. The combination of the sweet cheesecake paired well with the bitterness of their plain cold brew. 

Server, cant remember her name....sorry but she had a sweet Mickey Mouse tie....lol...was very attentive and nice !

Didnt wait long for our order , we were in and out within 40 minutes !!!

Will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"I can't recommend The Cheesecake Factory. When you flip through the menu, you'll see why -- it has too much variety. Variety sounds like a good thing at first, but you've heard the phrase \"Jack of all trades, master of none,\" right? The Cheesecake Factory is worse than a typical chain restaurant, it's a chain restaurant that has no focus or mission. It's a restaurant that, because of the sheer numbers of dishes it serves, can't possibly concentrate on any of them long enough to make them well.

On a menu like this, choice is more a crap shoot than an opportunity."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i just ate there afew hours ago and it was great.our server was very nice and sweet.they served my soda in a huge glass and refilled it as needed without me having to ask.the wheat bread they give you before dinner is awesome.the white not so good.I ordered off thier new light menu.(called skinny something or other don't remember)I had the chicken soft tacos.they were excellent.I couldn't even tell they were low cal.they also had cabbage in them and the cilantro was seasoned nicely to add lots of flavor.my b.f. ordered a burger well done and it was cooked just right.I never eat burgers but I tried a bite of his just to see,and it tasted great,like it was fresh off the grill.the rice that came with my tacos was very flavorful and a good size portion as well.the only complaint I had was that as I sat down,I noticed a lil black hair on my napkin/linen.luckilly I saw it before I used it.I asked for a new one and the server was nice and apologetic about it.honestly it was so small I can see how it was overlooked.these things happen.I don't blame anyone for that.overall it was a good dining experience .(minus the hair of course)."}
{"text":"First time eating dinner here and the shrimp and chicken gumbo was excellent.. The service was great and our server was polite and very attentive.. I would go back the menu had lost of endless choices to chose from."}
{"text":"I've been here once, and I was expecting this place to wow me. It didn't live up to it's reputation of being so dazzling. I waited about 10 minutes in line and when we finally got seated the waiter took 30 minutes to ask for our order. I ordered a steak (well done) with a side of French fries. That took another 30 minutes to arrive and my steak was very raw. I didn't bother asking anyone to do it again because no one was around and I didn't want to wait any longer. Though the steak was bad the french fries were alright. Funny thing is, they only took about 5 minutes to give us the check. 
Service is mediocre. Food is a downer."}
{"text":"Food here was excellent as was the service. We came on a crowded Saturday evening, but were able to be seated fairly quickly. Our server got all the order correct and the food showed up in less than 10 minutes. I was impressed with the flavor and would recommend here for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"The food is consistent excellent but the menu can be daunting with all the selection! Serving size is always generous as many American restaurants are. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I dig Cheesecake Factory. I've been here a bunch of times and never had a bad meal there. My last visit was for lunch with my friend and her 3 year old daughter. As soon as we were seated our server brought us bread and fruit for the kiddo. Portions are ginormous -- we had the Asian Chicken Salad and the fish tacos and went home with a full bellies and doggie bags.  The cheesecake rocks - I recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just came into town, and had wonderful service by Vince.  The smaller portion menu is great as well.  It is nice to get great customer service it is a real treat when so many companies could care less about it.  Vince does and it showed."}
{"text":"my boyfriend has wanted to take me to this restaurant for 3 years. we finally went on a special occasion. i was looking forward to a really good meal and nice ambiance. ok, so the food was way overpriced for what you got. we went for breakfast. the portion was average, nothing spectacular and it was pricey for what you got. the service was super slow. yes, it was busy, however, it was slower then slow. it was very noisy, putting a damper on our special occasion. the decor was the only nice thing about the visity. service blew. prices blew. nothing special. i could've went to a hole in the wall diner and got a heaping portion for less money and better service."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed dinning here, but tonight was an exception. My salmon was overcooked and very dry, with veggies cold. The server returned again with my same plate so hot and food all overcooked. The server had poor attitude and pretty much ignored us. Manager offered a new meal after guest finished eating their meal. Forget this place server said we were lucky to be comped."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Vegas! Food was amazing!!! Loved their angel hair pesto like pasta with chicken. So good! Loved their bread basket esp the rye, really fresh! Just disappointed to one of our visits as our waitress never served them. Their shrimp and fries, chicken strips with corn on the side were good! Portion sizes were huge! 

Can't beat their desserts! Red velvet and carrot cheesecake were fantastic! Really recommend these 2 flavors."}
{"text":"Went with a big group and service was great. Food was very bland and boring. Ordered shrimp scampi which was shrimp and noodles with roasted garlic. No butter sauce. 2 stars for the service but will not go back."}
{"text":"The factory was over-crowded Saturday night. For two of us, there was about a 90 minute wait. Good thing Ross Park Mall is next door which gave us plenty to do while we waited. I ordered the Hibachi Steak which was fantastic. The service was very good even though we were a little disappointed to be seated in a little corner in the bar area. Even though the place was mobbed, we could still have a nice conversation. I would go back again, but not on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"You really can't ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory  no matter what city you're in.  (Though I've found the one in Northern NJ and in Phoenix is better than Baltimore) Big menu, decent eats, and affordable."}
{"text":"The best \"go to\" meal on a Sunday period.  We love the food...and the service is stellar.  We have been going to this location for the past 7 years and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Within the last few months I went twice while visiting Pittsburgh.  The first time I had the Miso Salmon, miso glazed salmon on a bed of brown rice with sugar snap peas.  Absolutely excellent...except that the dish contained only 5, maybe 6, snap peas.  I didn't get my veggie serving in on that meal.

The second time I had the Chicken Marsala over Bow Tie Pasta.  The pasta was gummy and hard...like they only cooked it part way in prep and hoped it would cook fully after  tossing it in the pan and putting it under the hot lights -- which it was because the top layer of pasta was hardened.  The flavor was good, but there was not enough sauce.  The sauce was overly greasy, too.   It came with four tender, pounded thin, chicken breast pieces, about the 4 or 5 inches in diameter.   I ate half of it, carefully saving a lot of mushrooms (button and shitake) because they gave the most flavor to the dish plus two of the four chicken pieces, so I could have some take home in my hotel.  However, when I opened the take home container the next night, I had only one chicken piece and, literally, one slice each of button and shitake.

WTF?  Where the heck did the rest of meal go to???  

Because of this and the loud back room (steerage, I joked, to my companions) where  they seat the undesirables -- drunken parties, families with children, teen dates, and underdressed folk (which we were because we had just come from the airport on both occasions) I gave only two stars.  I would have given one if not for the awesome salmon (which I ordered rare and they actually obliged!)"}
{"text":"I hate that I am writing a horrible review about Cheesecake Factory as it is one of my favorite restaurants. I have worked in the food and beverage industry for about ten years so I like to think I am very reasonable when it comes to my expectations as well as being understanding that things will- and do go wrong daily in this business. My last experience at The Cheesecake Factory was unacceptable. I have never felt the need to write a bad review after a bad experience but I feel compelled to address this particular situation in hopes that it will never happen to myself or any other customer again. My boyfriend and I frequent this restaurant as it is one of our favorite places to dine and while out for my birthday a couple weekends ago a series of unfortunate events occurred making it hard to want to ever come back. From the beginning our server seemed like he was in the weeds and struggling to keep up, I could tell because another server asked if he needed help and he was frantic while talking to us and the tables around. Like I mentioned before I have worked in this industry and have served many years so this particular part didn't bother me as much, but maybe he should have more training or an easier section on a Saturday night for the sake of the customers. Where it starts to get messy is after we ordered. I had ordered the four cheese pasta and my boyfriend had ordered the Filet Mignon. I am not sure if things were sent to the kitchen at different times or if there was a mistake in the kitchen because my pasta had been delivered to the table a minimum of 20 minutes before the steak got to the table. I had completely finished my meal (with some help from my boyfriend since he was starving) and was done before a steak came to the table. While very understanding that things happen in restaurants I am baffled by the fact that nobody communicated with us on what had happened. Our server was blatantly ignoring us, avoiding eye contact and didn't explain anything. The whole time this was happening our drinks were empty, never being filled. Finally he came to the table and when my boyfriend had mentioned it was unacceptable all he said was that he was going to send someone over to talk to us, still no explanation on what had happened. A steak finally arrived at our table and he started eating when another worker approached us and said he had received the wrong steak. Not really a problem because it was switched out fairly quick, but still another mistake made by our server. My boyfriend had finished majority of his steak dinner and was done eating so we flagged our waiter and asked for a check. Still a manager hadn't come over to our table and we were completely done eating. At the time we asked for our check I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. Finally a manager came to the table and said he heard there was a timing issue. While I hate creating a scene and ruin other peoples dining experience I didn't say much other then I had been completely done eating before his  food came out. The manager asked if we were getting dessert and I mentioned I had already placed the order. Still we had no explanation of what happened and the managers visit was very short. We were STILL waiting on our check and I could tell that the communication between the manager and our server was very poor. Our server came back still with no check and asked if we wanted the cheesecake to go or for here. I had ordered the cheesecake to go long before the manager came over so I was confused as to why he came back to ask that and it was clear he still hadn't sent the order through. So on top of waiting a unreasonable amount of time on food we spent an even more amount of time just trying to get our check and cheesecake to go and leave the restaurant. In the future I hope the employees at this location communicate appropriately with each other and the guests to avoid situations like these."}
{"text":"The sugar caddy at our table was empty the waiter was nowhere to be found, so I saw a manager (tall guy black hair and black glasses) talking to a waitress at a side station.  I got up to ask him for some more sugar and they completely  ignored me and went about their conversation.  so I asked a busboy waking by. This manager had the audacity to come to my table to ask was everything ok after he finished his conversation and I revived my sugar. when I asked him why he would ignore a customer asking for something and continued his conversation with his waitress he had the nerve to say that customers don't usually walk up to side stations. If there was sugar on the table and a waiter that could be found I wouldn't have to get up in the first place. This is not The way you treat paying customers.  Needless to say this manager who has zero idea how to handle customers ruined one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"This place is tacky as hell. Literally this is my hell. It's  the Indian Jones ride at Disneyland that serves dessert. Came in late on a Tuesday and the service was pretty good. The food is okay. Nothing spectacular but the cheesecakes are amazing. It's their namesake so I'm glad it is."}

{"text":"Yesterday was my 25th birthday and the day before was my 3 year wedding anniversary so my husband and I decided to celebrate at my new favorite place, the cheesecake factory. And being Vegas locals why not go to the new one so that we can shop at the outlets right after. Lets start off by saying I'm 9 months pregnant so waiting for food for too long is not my best friend. We came in and it took a second to be greeted by the host because she found whatever she was doing to be more important. After she was done she did greet us and we waited to be seated. Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren't offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied \"oh I'm your server give me a minute they seated three of y'all at once\". First that's very unprofessional, second don't think that because we're both African american that I'll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests. So of course I took my business elsewhere so thanks a lot for wasting my time that I can never get back and ruining my birthday and I will be sure to yelp you folks as well. Very poor customer service"}
{"text":"The negative effects of this dining experience (on my pallet, stomach, and wallet) inspired me to join yelp to warn others to avoid the place. Of the six entrees served to our party of six, four were saturated with garlic and salt. Its amazing how they were able to come up with so many variations three main ingredients: salt garlic and butter.  I am lying awake now hours after the meal with indigestion, regretting the choice to eat there. The waitress, while very attentive, frequently interrupted our conversations. I was told the cheesecake was good. They automatically add 18% to the bill for parties of 6 or more, which offends me.

This is my third meal here in the last 5 years. Each has gotten progressively worse. The next time I return to this location it will be another business. My guess is that it won't be long."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had in a long time. Came during lunch and it was not yet the lunch rush. Ordered my food that came out wrong.  Had to wait for it to be re-made and when it was it was too greasy to eat.  Once I received my bill, I get charged for a drink that was never ordered.  Overall a bad experience and will not return to this location."}
{"text":"An hour and 45 min wait turned into thirty minutes really quickly.  We sat on the table and got swift service.  Barely had to wait long for our food and the rose martini is to die for!  Our waiter was down to earth and professional.  He got our whole order correct and I will be returning to this Cheesecake Factory.  Great food great service!  My advice.  Always go for pastas with this place.  So good."}
{"text":"First time eating at Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburger and it was so good it rivaled a Gordon Ramsay burger and I love Gordon Ramsay burger. Service was good and restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I love the Factory Burger here. It's a little different with the brioche bun but still retains its classic American burger taste.  The location is great so  I never have to leave my Summerlin bubble.  I usually just eat at the bar where I get fantastic service every time."}
{"text":"Very unhappy. I don't get out much for meals so I was hoping for a treat. This is a Tuesday and I had chosen my menu item last Saturday. I never order a drink but decided to on a whim. I ordered a mojito. They had no mint. Ok. I could live with that. I ordered THAI lettuce wraps. They couldn't provide them either. Don't they have buyers? It was the lunch hour !!"}
{"text":"First, I can almost guarantee that you will not find better service in the Valley that tops The Cheesecake Factory. Every visit, every time; this place has it together. 

The only reason it gets four (4) stars is due to the price. Taking my family out here and I am sure to get a bill topping one hundred bucks ($100) easily. 

However, aside from price, the staff is great and I have never had an issue with any of the waiters/waitresses that work there. The food, albeit a wide variety of it, it always good (with the exception of a steak that I felt was a little dry).

If we are looking for a great place to eat and have a little extra cash to spend, this place gets our first looks."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was excellent, the place was clean, and i really enjoyed the fresh ambiance.
The only problem was they didn't  pre bus my table."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Had the chopped salad. Awesome!! Cannot say enough about this place! Beautiful restaurant and excellent service!  Will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Vegas for the Sema show and Thursday night we were hungry so we stop by the cheese cake factory we had this waiter his name is Vaughn and oh WoW Wow Wow Wow I was impressed by his service and his mannerisms all I can say that Vaughn can work anywhere .... We have been to so many restaurants and no one has ever giving us the service Vaughn  did his great and I hope the best for him. Now days is hard to find people the give u good customer service because I know from experience working with the public can be challenging at time but Vaughn was amazing wow 2 thumbs up for this guy !!!!"}
{"text":"Just walked into the lobby for dinner and the lobby is packed.  I Walked around the restaurant and counted 15+ open tables.  When I asked the manager he said it was because of a shift change.    I've been in many Cheese Cake Restaurants and never seen one this mis-managed."}
{"text":"Found a hair on the side of plate and just took it off thinking it was my own but then in the middle of my entree while cutting up a piece of shrimp another hair emerged and it was buried within the sauce of my dish. It was taken by a server, never heard an apology or if they were going to make another dish. As well as I didn't even get to explain what happened. Long after the rest of my party ate, a manager (I assume since she wasn't in a uniform) brought out my food and placed it on the table as quickly as she could and left without saying anything. Six out of the seven people at our table needed refills and didn't receive it until we flagged down our server. Then at the end of the meal, the bill came out where they \"comped\" the first ruined entree with a hair in it and charged me for the one they made after. I'm not one to try to get a free meal but with poor service there was no reason to even charge me for something that had a hair in it, no attempt at finding out what happened, I didn't even asked for it to be made again, and no apology. We asked for a manager since nothing was being addressed at all and they just comped it without even coming to the table and again no one apologized."}
{"text":"Granted they were busy, but the service was lacking and slow.  My water glass was consistently empty.  

Chicken marsala and bow tie pasta:  chicken was good but the pasta was completely dry and blah.  

Bang bang chicken and shrimp:  way too much coconut flavor, overly sweet.  

Id say my wife and I left about half of our plates un-eaten.

Ordered coffee and cheesecake.  Cheesecake was good, coffee didnt show up until after we finished the cheesecake.  Again poor service.

All of that for $52.  Not worth it for a big plate of mostly plain dry bow tie pasta and the other mostly rice.  Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Part of me doesn't want to like this place, but let's be honest...for the most part, the food is freakin' delicious. 

What I'm trying to get past though is the 500 page menu with nothing that is particularly healthy. Also, as a general rule I try to stay away from chains (it helps me feel more snobby). But like I said at the Cheesecake Factory, everything seems to taste great.

On our last trip I went with the \"Bang Bang Chicken.\" Sure, it wasn't what I'd expect from an authentic Thai restaurant, but I wouldn't have been at the CF if I wanted authentic Thai. For an American take on the dish I'll say it tasted awesome.

If nutrition is on your mind, it's a bit tough to navigate the menu. You'll probably be able to get out under 1,000 calories, but you need to know what to look for, limit the alcohol intake and skip dessert.

At the end of the day, if you're looking to meet up with friends it's a great venue. Tastes will appeal to almost anyone, the drinks are good, and if you're splurging, the Cheesecake is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this place, live down the road and ordered a pickup today of the Luau Salad, had a little mishap mid meal once I got home. Called to explain the situation to one of the managers, Rob answered and took care of it with the utmost of professionalism and courtesy. Definitely a return customer."}
{"text":"Only one thing to say: Lemoncello cream torte.  

My sole reason for entering the restaurant."}
{"text":"I wish I could have the team who designs the inside of these restaurants design my house.  Between the 'Factory in Chicago and the one in Charlotte, they're probably some of the prettiest places to eat.  

The food?  It's good.  I've never had the issues the other reviewers are calling the \"6 o'clock sweats\".  But the food here does seem to have some quality that leaves me feeling completely saturated.  Maybe it's one of those places that makes your eyes fall out of your head when you see the nutritional facts on their food.  
Whatever the case, the menu is pretty diverse.  I've eaten about a dozen times split between the two 'Factory restaurants I've visited and only been disappointed once.  

Their cheesecake is pretty unique.  I can down a slice of cheesecake in a sitting pretty easily, but the cake from here takes me at least 3 attempts to finish it.  But that's a good thing.  It packs all the flavor (and calories, I'm sure) of 3 slices of your typical cheesecake into one slice.  

The service has always been very good, even when it's packed, (which is often.)
Their beer list is usually pretty decent.  They usually have the typical summer wheat, a couple lagers, a dark and one or two \"local\" brews, (for Charlotte, that means Yuengling.  Chicago was Goose Island.)  Nothing extravagant, but their beer selection does a good job of matching the light, stylish mood of the restaurant.

It's pricey, but I don't come here when I'm searching for a good value.  I come when I'm looking for a reliable menu and a lot of atmosphere.  

If you've never been, you really do need to try it.  For the cheesecake if nothing else."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see this particular store was so very 
different than all the other Cheesecake Factory's I've 
eaten in. The service was poor, the table was a mess,
the silverware was haphazardly placed. The table was actually dirty and when I brought it  to the attention of staff, she scooped it off with her hands,  we were speechless. 
The flavor of the food has diminished over the years,
or is it this location? I'll try The Cheesecake Factory 
ONCE more....another location!"}
{"text":"Spectacularly vast menu, and every option I have ever had has been delicious. I typically pick up the 'Tossed Salad' for lunch. Three separate occasions I was waiting 15-20 minutes for my salad after the pick up time they had given me. They also messed the actual order a couple times. Anyway, it happens, but several times is a little annoying. I'll still go though because it's a great salad for a great price. Just need a little work on service."}
{"text":"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory over 20 times in the States. So happy they have finally opened up their 1st Canadian location in The 6. And it's just as good as it's counterparts in the States. Wait times maybe a bit long but it brand New & in Yorkdale the busiest mall in the city so what do you expect. However the service is phenomenal & as time goes on it will only get better & more efficient.

Let's get on to the Food. Note Portions are Huge. And Bread is Free. Do yourself a favor & get the Brown Bread as it's incredible. You can even buy it as a baguette & take it home for $4.50. 

For Apps I def recommend the Sweet Corn Tamale Cake. Trust me order this & it will Change Your Life. 

For Mains my fav is the Wasabi Ahi Crusted Tuna, but it's unfortunately not on the menu. So I went with the classic Steak Diane with Mash Potatoes. It's always a Winner & you can't go wrong. 

And for dessert Hands Down the Best Cheesecake is the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. It's super light & easy to eat even after a filling meal."}
{"text":"great for a midweek brunch treat. Nice location. did not appreciate that my waitress DID NOT tell me that cranberry is not part of the kids' meals options and costs an extra 3.00 a glass."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a chain, and it's very easy to find something for everyone here. The staff has always been friendly, and the menu is huge! The food is just okay though. Would return with friends or for convenience, but we would not go on our own."}
{"text":"First time we went my family and I waited 1 hour and 45 min -  our pager buzzed and we were told to stand in another waiting section, because there was noone available to walk us to our table - so we stood and waited with the other people who were also waiting to be seated for another 15 minutes. Finally, we get seated...placed our drink and food order and no bread came....we are starving by this time...so we ask for bread...waiting, waiting...bread finally arrives then our food.  ALL of our food was COLD...by this time were are getting frustrated...we tell our waiter and his response upsets all of us. His response was \"all I can do is offer to \"reheat\" it\"  REALLY!!! You want to put our food in the microwave!!! So my husband asks to speaks with the manager - our food is remade and its pretty good - we even get free cheesecake. So by the end we are all fine and say we will come back and give it another chance.  Well we went on Friday - only had a 30 minute wait this time - we ordered our food and get our bread (without having to ask). Our food arrives FREAKING COLD AGAIN (pissed and annoyed) my daughter and I decide to send ours back- my husband sucks it up (I ordered the flatbread pizza) my daughter gets her meal back (watery) and I got HALF of my flat bread pizza back with burned edges - YUP, you read it right...HALF of my DAMN pizza was missing and they didn't say shit about it - like it was cool! I did not send it back I paid for the damn meal AND still gave the server his tip - BUT MY FAMILY AND I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!!!!!! PISSED!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite !!!! I ordered the fried Mac n cheese and onion rings !! I was so full I didn't have room for cheese cake :( the staff was fast and friendly and the place was very clean and inviting!"}
{"text":"We have visited this Cheesecake factory location several times and the food has always been ok, service a little slow.  On our most recent visit, my daughter and I both ordered the White Chicken Chili (which I order almost every time I visit) and it arrived looking very different than usual.  It tasted like they had dumped a whole bottle of chili powder in our bowls and I asked the server if they had changed the menu recently, because the White Chicken Chili is usually WHITE, not dark red.  I also told her that it tasted pretty bad and I wasn't able to finish my meal because the spice they used was overpowering.  Our server said she asked the manager and the kitchen what they had changed and came back to our table and told us that they had left an ingredient out of the recipe in error and that is why it tasted that way.  Really? No offer to make it right - just substandard tasting food at full price.  Because I had eaten about half my meal and so had my daughter, we didn't feel right asking for a refund - but I can tell you that we won't be returning to this location.  To cap off our lunch we waited almost 20 minutes for our server to run our card before we could leave."}
{"text":"Wonderful and large plates means a take out bag every time. Lots of variety to please. Cheesecakes that go on for days! Always satisfied with this chain."}
{"text":"Typical good experience at Cheesecake Factory. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it was spicy and very good. My wife had the Herb Salmon and loved it. Sat on the patio and enjoyed the nice Arizona weather. Only bad thing was  we didn't leave room for desert since portions were so large. Only downside was it took awhile for food to be cooked"}
{"text":"Summary: A 90 minute wait for subpar food and service and an injured child. 

I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. I had heard it was good, so we decided to check it out. The wait time on Friday evening was 90 minutes. This is understandable. What is not is watching tables be vacated and then seeing them sit dirty for 15 or more minutes before being flipped. On a busy night, that should be done within minutes. 

We were seated in their 'outside the restaurant but inside the mall area' without being given a choice of where we'd like to sit (in or out). We had our 2 1/2 year old son with us and put his order for corndogs and fruit in right away. In the meantime, I had water,my husband ordered a mocha, and our son had chocolate milk. Our drinks took about 15 minutes to get to the table, as did the basket of bread. The waitress dropped off the drinks and the mocha was lukewarm, not hot. It took so long for us to get our drinks, that when the waitress finally dropped them off and took our order, my son's food was done and delivered to the table.

This is important if you have children: do NOT get the corndogs, or if you do, remove the sticks before you let them have them. The sticks they use have pointy, sharp ends inside the hot dog. My son bit into his hot dog and ended up cutting the inside of his mouth. We didn't realize the extent of his injuries until we were home and he started crying while brushing his teeth. (My husband waited 15 minutes on the phone for a manager before he hung up and called back and demanded to speak to one). 

Another aspect of the kid's meal we didn't like is how they did the fruit for the side. It was chopped up into teeny tiny pieces. Many little kids are picky eaters and won't eat something unless they can see what it is, which is why my son wouldn't eat it even though he loves all the fruits that were in the side. I would prefer larger chunks that are still manageable. 

As for the adult food. I had the Skinnylicious Turkey and Avocado sandwich with a side salad and my husband ordered the gumbo. I expected a warm sandwich, and instead I received cold turkey, on a very cold bun, with cold bacon. My husband said his chicken and shrimp was overcooked. I tried a bite and the gumbo itself was pretty bland. 

At the end of our meal, we had all our dirty dishes stacked at the end of our table for a good 10 minutes before our waitress came to check on us. This was pretty thematic throughout the meal. Our waitress was pretty scarce. We wanted some cheesecake, but since there was no wait staff around, my husband went to the wait station and grabbed a menu for us to review. When our server returned, it took 15 minutes to get 1 slice of cheesecake to go. Let's be clear, this is a pre-sliced cake that's been sitting on a plate in a display case. It should not take that long to put a slice in a to go container. We had our bill paid and were sitting and just waiting for our cheesecake to go. 

The service was abysmal. Our waitress looked like half her section was in our 'outdoor' area and half indoors. This meant that she wasn't around much. Not once did a bus boy or other server stop by while we were waiting to check on us or clear our dirty plates. We did not see a manager during our entire time there. 

TL;DR - skip the hype. The food is not worth the wait or the price. Check your kids food order if you do decide to risk it to ensure no dangerous, pointy items hiding in there. 

The cheesecake was decent. So maybe call in an order for cheesecake to go, stop in and pick it up, and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. Trust me, the service will be quicker and friendlier that way."}
{"text":"I visited this Cheese Cake Factory for a late lunch date.  My recommendation was a mistake.

First we arrived at 2:30 PM and submitted our name to be told it would a 15 to 20 minute wait. I found that to be unacceptable considering the time of the day and considering that the restaruant was far from busy.

We were finally setted and given a menu.  The waitress did arrive at our table in a timely manner.  We both ordered an Ice Tea as a beverage.  She returned timely.  We told her that we needed a few minutes to decide on lunch and she left, returning timely. My date ordered a Crab Cake appetizer, a Chicken Oriental Salad. I an old fashion Burger and Salad combo. My date told the waitress that the Crab Cakes were good, but the chicken in the salad was over cooked and very dry.  My burger was at best etable and the salad small.  So far, just lunch, not so good!
  
Then we were ask if we wanted dessert and my date ordered the Pumkin Spice Cheese Cake. It was delivered and as she ate the Cheese cake, I noticed a hair in it. I called the waitress over and she offered and it was accepted to get a new piece delivered. It was placed in a take home container.  It was never offered to take the item off the bill, which I felt should ahve been the case. I mean a hair in it?

Issue number two.  We were never ask if we wanted a refill on our Ice Tea. although it was obvious that our glasses had been near empty throught out entree's.  

So in a nutshell, we had a less than enjoyable dining experience and the tab? In my opinion, was to expensive. For a simple appetizer, oriental chicken salad. a burger and small-small salad, and two ice teas, came to $52.64.  then add a tradional tip of $12.00, it cost me $63.00 for a lunch!  I doubt that I will recommend or entertain another date at this place!"}
{"text":"I love the cheese cake factory for there cakes. The reason they are getting three stars is they are very over priced there menu is massive and there food is ok. But the price makes you flinch for what you get. Yes they are large portions, but I would rather have good flavored food and smaller portions for the price you pay."}
{"text":"It was great the last few times...
 till I found a dried piece of spinach stuck on my fork when I unwrapped the silverware, and dishes had crumbs encrusted on them."}
{"text":"Their cheesecake and food is amazing however the service is terrible. Waited 15 min to get my check and then another 15 min for the server to return with my credit card. If you are in a hurry skip this place!"}
{"text":"they have awesome cheesecake.. u got to check it out!! every meal on the menu is so good... got the kobe burger omg.. wat a burger..the environment so awesome.. good for the night life and good to bring ur family out for lunch or dinner..."}
{"text":"I hate chains...and yes, I admit, we went here yesterday.

But you know what? Cheesecake is freakin solid. I've tried hating this place and decided to give up.

The five of us ventured here yesterday to indulge. We ordered the following: Ahi Tartare, Calamari, Chicken Marcel, Chicken Teriyaki, Salmon, Cobb Salad, Four Season Pizza, Bloody Mary, AND coffee/espresso... yes we were pigs. 

My favorite is the Ahi Tartare. The Ahi is fresh and the dish is just perfect. I also tried the Calamari, and was very surprised. The seasoning was awesome, and the portion was great for us to share. A little on the greasy side, but still very good.  All of the entrees were awesome as well, with plenty of leftovers. And the salads are always yummy. 

The service was solid as well. 

Do I feel like a corporate chain loving whore? Yes. Is it ok to feel that way at times? Absolutely. My tummy agrees."}
{"text":"Long, long, wait times, but the food is good. The server I had, Pierre was excellent! The menu prices do seem a bit over priced but let's be honest. The only reason we're going to this place is for the cheesecake :) If they could somehow fix the crazy wait times I would give this place 5 stars. But it's been like that for years now. A great place to go every once in a while."}
{"text":"First off, this place is AMAZING! My wife and I come here three times a month at minimum. It's the go to place! We split Factory Nachos and a strawberry lemonade. Over the years I can count ONE time that our nachos were unsatisfactory and when we talked to a manager they took excellent care of us! The only reason for the one star is the occasional bad server, But that's very rare. We'll typically leave a twenty percent Tip without hesitation. Defenitly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food:
The lunch special really surprised us. The portion was enormous. We ordered the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad and Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. 

Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: The pasta was kinda sweet yet spicy at the same time. We really enjoy it. 
Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad: I kinda like the fried onion strings on top. It was very crispy and crunchy. However, there was too much dressing on the salad.  

The only thing amazing about this place is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake!! We are in love with it!

Atmosphere and Service: Long wait time and the service was really slow. The indoor design is nice, but the outdoor building design looks much more amazing.

Overall: Definitely recommend everyone to come try out their cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"This is a 2 star only because my wife's meal was edible and the manager took care of my meal issues.  We went to lunch expecting a nice meal.  We have been to this location at least 30 times over the years and have had good meals.  Today not the case.  Start with the edible meal.  My wife ordered chicken tortilla soup and turkey sandwich with small salad.   The bowl of CHICKEN tortilla soup had 2, maybe 3 pieces of actual chicken in it.  Hardly any tortilla in the soup, but it had flavor and was spicy.  We were given white sourdough bread, but expected the good dark sweet bread that we have received every other time here.  For some reason we didn't get the bread we liked but the tables next to us got it?   Her sandwich was okay, nothing to brag about.  I ordered a dinner portion Cobb salad.  I have ordered this before and really enjoyed it.  This time it came out looking sad.  I noticed a literal ball shape of chicken on the right side of the salad.  Upon inspecting it and peeling apart the chicken layers, it was nasty.  It showed many signs of being undercooked, was a bit slippery, and was fatty.  It was also stone cold.  It looked like someone reached into an old tray of chicken and grabbed a ball of old chicken and set it on my salad.  The kitchen staff obviously did not inspect the chicken.  The rest of the salad was not too good.  Hardly any egg around the edge like I normally get.  Barely any dressing in the salad and not much bacon.  It was basically chopped lettuce.   I showed the waitress the chicken and her face showed it all.  She showed the manager and he came over and apologized and agreed that the chicken looked bad.  He did not charge me for the salad.  I was offered replacement food as well but did not feel like eating anything else there at the time.   The salad was $15.  I hope they have not changed their salads since the last time I had a good one there.   It definitely was not worth $15 even with a good piece of chicken.  

Overall, a nice day off with my wife and the lunch was a huge disappointment.  I probably won't go back to this restaurant for a while.  The staff were nice and I left a 15% tip based on the full meal price before the comped salad.  Not the waitress fault that the kitchen was inept today in performing their job."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu to choose from. Their food is just okay and a little bit pricey, but you do get your money's worth in terms of food portion. 

They are usually very busy and there will be at least a 15-60 minute wait to get a table. Service will be kind of slow since the place is extremely huge. They do take reservations on the weekdays, but not on the weekends. It will be first come first serve and they recommend you coming in at least 45 minutes early with half of your group in order to sign in.

All in all this is a great place to go for a special occasion, but not really good for a everyday night out dinner."}
{"text":"good service, good food, good atmosphere. slightly too dark inside... hahaha no big deal though."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars for service. The food was great had sweet potatoe fries. There was a delay in getting food at same time in our party. The mgr came out explained small delay, offered us appetizers, cheesecake. Things happen. They gave excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location does not know how to handle or accommodate the masses. We arrived for an early dinner around 4:45 pm on a Saturday. We were told there'd be a 45-60 minute wait...........we waited for an hour and a half for a table for TWO PEOPLE and still ended up walking out due to starvation. Need I mind you this is after we witnessed others come in after us and be seated before us.  Stop by on the weekends if you have 6 hours to spare."}
{"text":"I love eating here. Huge menu selection and healthy choices if you want. I really like the barbeque chicken salad. Large enough to bring half home as leftovers!"}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night out. The food was good but, not anything special. The portions are great which makes it worth the price.The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere.The place was clean the waiters were really friendly and attentive to our needs even though they were extremely busy."}
{"text":"We went here on st. Patricks day and it was terrible. We were told the wait was 30 minutes but waited over an hour. While we were waiting I noticed a roach on the floor. 

The waiter took ten minutes before ordering our drinks once we were seated. My sandwich was burnt. My boyfriend got his food and they told us the fries were being cooked so he had to wait longer for the fries. The second waiter we got was much  better. Had it notbeen for his kindness and staying on top of things I would have left.

Service was terrible and the food was gross. We only went because we had a gift card. Not gonna go back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Going twice a week to same location but this time is gonna be the last time. Horrible service, the gentleman who served us didn't want to come and ask if we need anything. Took at least 10 to 15 min to make a order after I asked about a meal he said I have to be at the different table and I'll be back. He was gone for 10 min again. I asked for brown bred he brought a white one and just dropped at the table and was gone. We had to ask a lady to get it but she just told him that. Now he brought only 1 peace and we where 3 person at the table and it was dry and cold. We had to ask if he could refill our water never happen, he never come just walked by. We asked for straws as well never received any. This service change our mind to come there again. I better drive to different locations but not there."}
{"text":"I have been many times at the Cheesecake Factory and what can I say? I would come back anytime babeee ;)

I have tried many dishes and they all have been tasty, well seasoned and had satisfied my dear tummy. 

Portions tend to be large and in case you are not that hungry, you can always get something from their lunch menu (served until 5:00pm) and they have a nice variety of dishes. 

My favorite ones, tan taaann:

* The old fashioned burger, nicely charred and very tasty!

* Shrimp with Angel hair (I switch it for Penne pasta, personal preference) great fresh taste with lots of crushed tomatoes, lemon, garlic and a touch of basil and thyme. 

* The grilled Salmon is always flaky and delicious! One of my top favorites :) it comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli but you can have other sides upon request. I like the mashed potatoes, carrots and green beans, I think the broccoli is very bland. 

I also discovered a cocktail that I shouldn't have asked for! The reason? I fell in love with it but it's expensive, $10.50 :( it's called Ruby red crush (Vodka, lime, grapefruit juice, St Germain), it was a little bit strong, but so delicate made, I could taste every single ingredient and so perfect for summertime! 

Service has always been good and I appreciate that. For me, the Cheesecake Factory is part of the the restaurant list that my boyfriend and I like to visit, yes, you guessed right, the one we always fight for because it's hard to choose from! Even though we all know the Queen of the house it's the one who says the last word ;)"}
{"text":"Last weekend while running some errands in Charlotte, my husband, daughter and myself decided that it was time to hit up The Cheesecake Factory. Any other time we have gone, the food is always okay but pricey and we always get two pieces of cheesecake to share. This time around, my husband ordered the meatloaf lunch and when he got it, the meatloaf was dry and he compared it to chow hall food in the military. He said chow hall food was better than that! When the waiter came back like 15 minutes later, I told him that the food as gross. He took it away and never said a word. The manager popped up about 10 minutes later and offered him a menu but told him that everyone's tastes are different and they have never had a complaint about the meatloaf before. My thoughts were, \"it's dry and tough....Who would eat that?\" My husband just ordered a soup and salad lunch combo after he got another menu which was priced at like $15. The salad was horrible and the soup tasted like vegetable water almost. When our waiter came to the table, of course I had to be the one to call out the issues because my husband won't and I didn't want to have to pay for something that he didn't eat. Of course they did nothing about it. They just brought out the cheesecake and made us pay for a meal he did not eat or enjoy. Since I'm heading to Charlotte for my 24th birthday next weekend, I will definitely remember not to go back there and they won't get our business again. We will just mosey on over to Maggiano's for our next big business meeting."}
{"text":"I loved the rosemary chicken it was delicious...Anaheim Cheesecake Factory was delicious"}
{"text":"We don't go here a ton but it is an every other month restaurant for us. Typically I can't finish my entire meal as the portions are huge and if I want cheesecake then I have to save room. The service is typically adequate to very good, but compared to the Plaza branch I'm used to in KC, MO it is missing a little bit of charm.  A few things I was very happy to see on this trip (October) were firstly a very expansive healthy menu that filled all of mine and my wife's needs and secondly a new cheesecake that was made to have hints of pumpkin pie. Both were welcome additions and both were full of very tasty bites!!  Things that would make this a more regular trip to me and my wife....more draft beer choices and super cold iced draw glasses, and lastly more intimate seating."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly server, but blah food. No one in our party reported liking the food. Maybe it was the prices. I don't think that we will return."}
{"text":"Called in my order for curbside to go. I was told the order would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. I arrived 15 minutes later and parked in the appropriate place. I called several times to let them know that I had arrived. 45 minutes later I went in to get my order. So much for curbside service. The managers excuse was simply, \" lack of communication from the front desk\". And he also stated that this location don't get much business from curbside. 
Unhappy customer."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! My only objection was that we were a party of 2 and a party of 2 that came in after us was seated before we were. But, the wait time for a table was 5 to 10 minutes. I was in Las Vegas for 8 days and I have to say that was the quickest we got into any restaurant on the strip. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure our drinks were kept full. The atmosphere is beautiful but it is rather loud. We happen to get there when the Atlantis show was going on which made it even louder. The food was excellent. It was hot, great tasting and plenty of it. I left full and with a doggy bag. I spent close to the same amount I spent at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill that I only got three tiny sliders and ail at. Here I had appetizers, main course and desert. I would highly recommend here and would dine here again."}
{"text":"Dirty and expensive. Watched a busser drop silverware on the floor and just picked it up put it in the napkin as the next place setting!   Made me want to vomit!   What do they do that people can't see?"}
{"text":"I give you three stars Cheesecake Factory, for being what Family Guy calls, the practice girl.  You're always around when I need a pick up, you're not too fussy, and at the end of the night if I don't want to call you the next day, I don't have to and you don't mind. Food is priced pretty average, no meal should cost you more than 20 bucks if you don't get the cheesecake, but by all means, get the cheesecake, it's why you came after all.

In fact, a friend and I only go here for cheesecake, our once every six month hang out to dish over life at our respective colleges and stuff our faces with white chocolate raspberry truffle and godiva chocolate cheesecake respectively. 

They also give decent breads and are in a nice plaza with other similiarly wish-I-was-in-LA-Summerlin-boutiques and a new Gordon Biersch next door when you want to start slamming them down and accepting your life as the Real Housewives of Las Vegas. Cheers to you soccer mom, Cheesecake Factory is your Ketchup with class."}
{"text":"We visited this past Monday and sat at a big round table around 4:30 in the afternoon. The restaurant was not very crowded. The service was mediocre at best. The waitress forgot my salad and the burger that came to our table wasn't cooked how we ordered it. Took forever to re cook it. I always viewed the Cheesecake Factory as a nice place to go for a date or special occasion, but the past few times I've gone the staff has just been so \"blah\" that it doesn't even feel special when we go."}
{"text":"disappointed with the service. i went to this location just for dessert, and was there for 45 minutes. we were sat immediately and order within the first 5 minutes. my  cheesecake was wonderful as always but the server was inattentive to us, which I'm assuming was because we had made it known we were there for dessert only. we should have been in and out in 20 minutes, instead i sat there for 20 minutes waiting for the check. the waiter was nowhere to be seen, so i couldn't even stop him to ask for it. would i have received the same service if i had ordered a meal?? i think i will continue to make the trip to Caesars palace to enjoy the cheesecake factory in the future."}
{"text":"From Under Cheese Factory
By The Rue

Thursday lunch was the Cheesecake Factory,
Ordered an iced tea but not a daquiri,
Chicken chipotle pasta was satisfactory,
The bread and butter were complimentary.

The hostess was hot like they always are,
She led us to a table that wasn't very far,
When I go golfing I shoot way over par,
You cannot pay your tab with an Iraqi Dinar.

My friend ordered some asian salad,
Crispy and fresh the taste was valid,
This review is reading like a rock ballad,
There aren't many words that rhymn with salad.

I would have given them 4 stars, just one thing,
Even the lunch menu thinks you have bling bling,
$11.95 for a bowl of pasta like I'm a king,
On the weekends you and your wife like to swing. 

The service was great, waitress was aware,
I look like a hobo, she avoided my stare,
I usually go commando, undies I don't wear,
This place was good, and the food was fair. 

Brownies!!"}
{"text":"The food was good standard cheesecake factory food. However the lighting was so bad that i felt like i was eating in a dungeon. It was so cold that it may as well been a cave. I had to use the light on my phone to see the menu, which inspired others to do the same. (thankyou table of buisness nerds beside us) I will go back but only at noon maybe then they will have good lighting."}
{"text":"I have to update my review since the last three times we have visited. Each time we received a new waitress. Each time they acted as if we were bothering them when we asked questions about their menu as I have an allergy to butter and most dairy. I had high hopes for this place but they are so rude and could not seem to get my order right each time we went. Then I had to pay for the meal even though it was covered in cheese each and every single time. Mind you I said no cheese at all twice and the third time I asked for it on the side thinking this would be easier for them. I was wrong because they seemed to have just added more the last time. I didn't eat anything all three times we went so we have decided that if I am going to pay high prices for food then I would at least like to be able to eat it so we won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. My waffle was undercooked but my guest enjoyed the chop salad. 

Service was good but was surprised the inconsistency in food prep."}
{"text":"Have been to The Cheesecake Factory twice in the last two weeks. Each occasion we went, we purposely arrived between lunch and dinner when it wasn't crowded.We still waited for over 25 minutes for our meals (we ordered salads) .When we asked for extra dressing, another 10 minutes passed...Like I said, it was not crowded so I don't understand the wait. The second time we went, the same thing happened, but it took even longer to get our meals. Our waiter seemed distracted and rushed even though he was waiting on only 3 tables. We waited over 20 minutes for him to bring us the check. Ridiculous. Food okay and over-priced. Good service should be a priority. Also, music is too loud."}
{"text":"Amazing food. It was so hard to pick which cheesecake to take home! So I picked 2! This place is a bit expensive so I go as a special treat but it's worth it. Also don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"If I could, I would rate it as a 2.5 stars.  Last night was my first time going to this location and probably will be my last.  Upon arriving there was a weird fight over the hostess and some other girl in who wanted to seat us... thought that was unusual.  My husband went to the restroom to wash his hands and said neither of the faucets were working.  Those things weren't that bad and I can deal with it, however the low stars because of our server..

We ordered our drinks, my husband got his and five minutes later I finally got mine.  Then our server never seemed to come back, someone else gave us our meal and halfway through eating, she comes back saying she will give us some boxes.  I wasn't even done eating and I felt like she was rushing us to get out of there,(it was around 8-9pm) and I didn't even get to order a dessert."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ate here twice in a 12 day vacation in Vegas. Have previously eaten multiple times at the one in Orlando and they're both of same great standard.

Food is reasonably priced, delicious and generous sized portions. In previous orders I've had the mushroom burger, Kobe burger, bbq chicken pizza and some sort of pasta and each dish was delicious. I've never had a bad meal here. 
The service was fantastic too!
I've tried the vanilla bean cheesecake twice, the carrot cake (not cheesecake) twice and the red velvet cheesecake once.
The red velvet was the least favourite of mine but the carrot cake is probably THE best carrot cake I've ever tried anywhere and the vanilla bean cheesecake flavours are to die for, delicious! 
The location in Vegas has two floors so plenty of space to get seated even if it is busy. 
Wether in Vegas or Orlando the Cheesecake Factory is my go to restaurant when I have a sweet craving!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I came here for the first time and thought it was amazing. Most places give you a tiny personal pizza and you end up still hungry. Because of this, I ordered a personal pizza and chicken tenders. I was wrong and a big, still warm pizza came with large chicken tenders and fries. I ended up having to take most of it home. The wait for our food was a bit long but we had delicious bread at our table along with butter. 10/10 would go there again."}
{"text":"Went late (about 10pm) so no wait. Server was prompt and professional. We ordered a couple larger salads and food came quickly. Portions were quite large and so take home was necessary. They do have the full menu available, including a healthier 'skinnilicious' menu with smaller plates, apps and salads. 

First visit to this location so an average score to start, they meet expectations, no compaints"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is always good for me ! One of my favorite places. Good food, good service."}
{"text":"They got the orders from 50% of our group wrong including mine. Then got the factory nachos. The chips were burn, the cheese was barely drizzled on it, about 5 pieces of jalapeño. Was not worth $5 and nowhere near the $12 they charged. Horrid compared to what you get out at other locations like Boca. Total ripoff."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the sweet corn tamale cakes, great flavored. For dinner I had the crab cakes and Caesar Salad, perfect combination. And for desert, I took home a piece of banana cream cheesecake, I definitely will be returning, and I can't wait to have the sweet corn tamale cakes again! 
Unfortunately I had to deduct a star cuz the hosts up front were very rude to us the the other customers waiting also. I actually felt horrible for an older lady trying to find out how much longer she had to wait. The hostess said there are other places around here if you have a problem waiting for good food."}
{"text":"For some reason I've been to this location several times and there's days I get the same dish and it's brought out to meet different I don't know if it's been cooked something differently or something change feel good in my opinion just not consistent"}
{"text":"Just ate at the Cheesecake Factory. Where the food was good again. The service was terrible. Had the bread, then the drinks came 10-15 minutes after they were just ice tea, cokes and lemonade. Then refills never came till the food arrived after asking for more. The server wasn't paying attention messed up the split checks and how it was charged. The food was delayed between people and they forgot my cheesecake. Cheesecakes were amazing. Too bad service is a big part of a restaurant so I give it 3 stars. Hope you have a better experience. I hope next time when I come back its better."}
{"text":"I ate here earlier tonight with a couple friends of mine and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. The line to get in was pretty long but surprisingly enough I was seated within 5 minutes of my arrival. The atmosphere was amazing, and the food itself was even better. This is my new favorite restaurant and I would greatly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good food with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dined here during my last 3 Vegas trips. Food and service have  been excellent. Ribeye and prime sirloin steaks were both excellent. The garlic herb butter on top of the steak was da bomb! Just exploded with flavor with each bites. The garlic mashed potato is loaded with calories but Who's counting.  Best CF location in my opinion. Manager, waiters/waitresses/hostesses are courteous and acommodating. While waiting for a table, The huge aquarium infront is definitely icing on the cake, no pun intended"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, they make one of the best burgers around. Exceptional cheesecake as well. The Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp is superb!"}
{"text":"Came by for dinner on a Monday night. Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Our server, I forget his name, was awesome. It was too loud in the area to be able to hear him unless he leans over and speaks up.. Perhaps it's just me and my hearing? *shrug*
I didn't have a big appetite that night. Just ordered something off their \"skinny menu\" ones with smaller portions and \"lower\" calories. Had the Ahi Tartare and the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps. Both was enjoyable and was filling, for me. 
All in all, very affordable, great for a date or with a large party. You have the option to sit inside or \"outside\". 
The restroom is upstairs on the second floor. Kind of a little journey just to wash your hands!"}
{"text":"Threw a friend's baby shower here and it went pretty smoothly. We made reservations well in advance, and it was a small party. I'm not a huge fan of their food but it's always busy so clearly other people don't have my same opinion. The three stars is for the service, they were super attentive and everything was taken care of for our party. I just don't think the cheesecake is that great, I'm sorry! But the apps aren't too bad."}
{"text":"Jerk server!  Took forever to take even our drink order Saturday during lunch!  My wife wanted to go because she loved a burrito they had several years ago and ordered the only burrito we could find. It wasn't the same - this one called Grande burrito.  She liked it anyway but not like the old one.  She mentioned it to the server and he said \"been working here a year and a half that's the only one\". Okay great, our bad, they stopped making it.  She still liked this one okay.  He came by again later and asked if she didn't like it and she explained it was good but not what she expected and could she have a box because it was huge.  She was smiling while complimenting their portion size!  His reply- no joke - \"grande means big in Spanish\" and I wish I could have videoed him - total ass!  I got a club sandwich, hard to screw that up - long story short, we'll make our own cheesecake and eat elsewhere if this is what The Cheesecake Factory has fallen to!"}
{"text":"Overall the waiter was great until the food came. My kale salad was salty. We sat next to the kitchen and the salad was sitting for some time. By the time the dishes came the buffalo blast were over fried as if the grease was old.  So the server took it back. Within 2 minutes they brought out the same blast that I just sent back. When they finally brought the blast out they looked the same.  If anyone has ever had an order of buffalo blast they are very light with a hint of chicken and a blast sauce inside.  So of course I didn't want them 20 minutes later.  The bun on the bacon burger was hard as if it was stale. The bacon burger had 2 strips of regular bacon and literally 2 small squares of applewood bacon ;(. When the waiter brought out the check he took off the order for the blast but added an order of buffalo wings that no one ordered.  The only thing that was worth the trip was the bread and butter. Of course the check was adjusted but we were really disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory.  

Thank goodness for Winchells being open 24 hours. The wings are amazing"}
{"text":"well its exactly what you expect from a large chain restaurant, massive portions and below average food quality.  Kids like it and its not a bad vibe.  If you are anywhere near being a foodie don't go here!  Find a locally owned restaurant and enjoy dinning out.  I had the chicken and biscuits, it was presented as a pile of food that looked like a pizza delivery guy drove it around the block a few times before it made it to my table.  need I say more......."}
{"text":"I am giving it high reviews because I love going there.... I love the small plates and the big plates too.... Few suggestions.... Make a cheesecake sampler dessert plate (for those that are arguing what to get)..... Make a vegan cheesecake... Make one with ricotta cheese, call it a cannoli cheesecake.... (I want royalties for that one!!!) Make cheesecake mini bites (for someone who just want a bite!!!)..... 
I ordered an Asian steak dish forget what it was called and it was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"It's The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to several and they've all been good. I don't have anything really bad to say. The food is good, but maybe just a tad on the pricey side for what you get. This particular one was busy when we went, and it was before 5 PM, which I would think would begin the dinner rush, but they seemed to have it handled. Our waiter took a while every time to get back to us when we asked for something, but again, we were there around 5 PM, so I'm sure he was occupied. He wasn't too friendly towards us, but again, I don't know what he's had to deal with that day. He wasn't rude or anything, just not overly friendly. I would come back again because they have such a big selectioni of food, and honeslty I don't think I've ever had the same thing twice yet, so I would like to go back and try their other items."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out for our 16th wedding anniversary.  Now we do not go out often, we don't have a lot of extra money so eating out is a treat we do on special occasions, kids birthdays etc...so this was a big deal.  Ordered the fried Calamari, greasy and rubbery.  Bread was hard.  I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with grilled shrimp...$23.  It was so greasy and the shrimp were rubbery.  This was the first time I've ever sent food back.  My husband ordered the steak tacos, they were cold.  Since he was so hungry, he ate them anyway but regretted it later that night.  The only good thing was Diane A. our waitress was amazing.  Hopefully she got to keep the whole tip!  So much for a romantic anniversary dinner without the kiddos!"}
{"text":"Very good service excellent Steak cooked perfect to My liking the asparagus was delicious.  My Son really enjoyed His Hawaiian Pizza abd of course the. Cheesecake was incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"The farfelle chicken with roasted garlic was so good. I want to go back already!
Cheesecake factory's food and service is so much better than the grand luxe cafe!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Super busy and the service is mediocre.. Huuuuge menu.. I had the 5$ happy hour burger and it was good."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since my wife and I visited a Cheesecake Factory. Our experience today was the same as we have always come to expect. Great food, excellent cheesecake, and superior service. Can't wait to visit again when we are in the area. We even got a bottle of wine we didn't finish packaged to go."}
{"text":"Went to the cheescake factory this weekend. Service was great and our server was amazing, however the food was not cooked as ordered. Managment was very understanding and rectified the situation right away so that is always a plus. Kudos to them and their staff."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas. I live across from Cheesecake Factory on Camelback Rd. I was hungry one night and stopped in for a quick bite on December 4th. I've always enjoyed their pineapple Mojitos  and the menu variety . I sat at a small table in the bar area. It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) \"I thought that you forgot about me?\" His curt reply was \"It's gotta cook!\"....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito. I am discovering that there are many other options in close proximity to me.....You NEVER know who your customers are! I've been in the restaurant business for over 30 years in New York, Paris and Las Vegas and have moved to PHX, to live and open a restaurant here....Oh, yeah, and I happen to be one of the Top Chefs in America:-)

{"text":"can't get passed the dessert list on the menu. their cheesecake is out of this world good! i always leave with a \"doggy bag\" and end up having to bring my cheesecake home to eat hours later because of how full i get from appetizers and the main dish. great place to eat."}
{"text":"Always good avacado eggrolls, ice tea, and chicken teryaki. A good choice everytime. This location is busy but you can walk around after a meal.which is a plus."}
{"text":"One of the best Cheesecake Factories I've been to.  Service is always just ok, but here we had very friendly, prompt service.  Food was good as it usually is.  I had a small chopped salad, hubby had lettuce wraps & daughter had a burger.  Crispy onions weren't ready so they brought the burger out with the rest of the food with an apology.  Onions were brought out shortly after.  Went back after our daughters soccer game to try out curbside delivery for dessert.  That was easy and quick too.  All in all, very happy with this visit."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love cheesecake? I do... hands down! I sat at the bar and had amazing service. It totally uplifted my spirits to have a friendly bar tender to chat with while watching the basketball games. Plus, I ended the night by eating three pieces of cheesecake.  My favorite was the red velvet cheesecake.  It's a must try. My car enjoyed the whipped cream."}
{"text":"Went with friends for my wife's birthday dinner. The evening started off okay. Went to the front area to check-in and get our buzzer. Our friends hadn't arrived yet, so waiting wasn't going to be much of an issue. Told the girl that we would be having 6 total guests, but 2 were a surprise for my wife, so please make sure the staff doesn't say anything and to only have 4 place settings at the table. I also told her it was my wife's birthday and to do whatever they do special for birthdays. (Cheesy singing by the waitstaff included.)

We went to the bar to have a drink while we waited. WAY overpriced drinks here. $16 for a Merlot and a pina colada. Strike 1.

Our pager goes off so I go up to have the staff seat us. I remind the girl up front that the head count is a surprise for my wife's birthday. The hostes takes us to our booth and says \"party of six?\" to which I replied to her \"no it's 4\". So, she went ahead and removed 2 of the 6 place settings. Strike 2.

Our friends arrived shortly after we were seated. They were brought over to sit with us and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. 
Fried calamari and roasted artichokes were good. Everyone else also enjoyed the avocado rolls. So far, the food is showing some promise over the dumb staff.

I ordered the chicken and sausage gumbo. Everyone else was half through their dinners before I got my dish. When it arrived, the only thing resembling gumbo was the rice. After the first taste, it was very bland and resembled some kind of creamy stew of unknown origin. Our waiter came by to ask if everything was okay, and how the gumbo was. After I told him it was so-so, he just asked \"just okay?\", smiled and walked away. No checking to see if I wanted something else instead.
About halfway through the gumbo, I started to not feel well. Our group ordered dessert, which they were all gushing over after it arrived. Unfortunately, the girl up front never shared with anyone that it was my wife's birthday. I had to say something to the waiter who smiled, said Happy Birthday, came back after 5 minutes with a couple of waitresses, none of which looked thrilled to be there, sang happy birthday, dropped off what was supposed to be a sundae, and walked away.

After a bit, my face started to swell, I grabbed a waitress to ask if they happened to put clams in the gumbo, which I am severely allergic to. 
After checking with the chef, she came back to inform me that they put clam juice in it. Anyone who knows about gumbo knows that the classic recipe doesn't have any clams, or clam juice, in it. And, the menu has no claims of allergy causing foods.

After a 20 minute ordeal of just trying to get the check so I could go get some pills from the nearby CVS, we were able to cash out and go. That was about the most embarassing and painful 20 minutes I've had in some time. When I first said something to the waitress, a woman came out from the back and simply said we're sorry, touched my shoulder, and went in the back again. 
Our waiter came by, asked if anyone came by to say anything, and saw that I was having trouble seeing the bill to split it. He offered to split the bill for us. At no time did he offer to get a manager to come talk to us. Shortly after the waiter left, a manager did come over after hearing what happened from the woman in the back. He offered to comp my gumbo and my wife's cheesecake.

Count me out from ever stepping foot in this overpriced carnival of lousy food and mediocre cheesecake. I'm from NY, and I've had better cheesecake out of the freezer at Costco.

The staff was nice enough, incompetent, but nice. Glad they offered an apology and to comp part of the meal, but I'm still upset that I had to pay anything after this ordeal.

NOTE: IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALERGIES, MAKE SURE TO ASK BECAUSE IT WON'T BE ON THE MENU!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Renees trio. $12.50 includes soup, salad & sandwich. All 3 were excellent, and the servings of all 3 were very generous. No cup of soup, it was a bowl. The chicken salad sandwich was wonderful except it was grilled and had i known i would have requested it not grilled. Loved it."}
{"text":"Spent 5 days in Vegas and went there for 3 dinners. Large portion sizes and at a great value. Food never disappoints and you know what you are getting. Staff were very attentive and wait was not long at all.. they seem to know how to run the place very efficiently. Well done - can't wait to go back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. By far The Cheesecake Factory is the best and has the most consistent quality for a chain. We were a party of 10 and the service was flawless."}
{"text":"Wait is longer than indicated - no reservations. Hosts do not acknowledge or update you."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chains but let me just say something about their tropical iced tea, because that's what I really go there for!  It's the best iced tea anywhere ever. Please don't ever change your iced tea.  Of course the food and cheesecake are good but the iced tea is truly where it's at!!"}
{"text":"TL;DR at the end.

Today is December 23, 2017.  I had my name and number of people in my group (ten) written down on the waiting list and received the buzzer.  I was also told that my entire group had to be present upon being seated at 10:00AM.  Since three out of ten of us were still on our way to the restaurant, they would not have been able to make it for 10:00AM.  We realized that and went back to see if we could change our seating time to 10:30AM.  No problem.  All was well at the time.  

Pager beeped at 10:00AM and ran to the front desk with the buzzing buzzer in hand and handed the buzzer to the head hostess.  (We were later told by our server that her name was Anna, so we will call her Anna.)  Anna asked me if the rest of my group was with me.  I said yes, they are walking towards the restaurant and will be here shortly.  I asked the front desk if they were told about the time change (from 10:00AM to 10:30AM).  They were not informed about it.  I explained, \"We have seven out of ten people who are present.  The other three are running late due to traffic.  Is there any way that we can push our time to 10:30AM as the man at the front counter outside marked us down for 10:30AM.\".  I was given a stern response by Anna saying-- this is not what she said exactly but it is along the lines of it--, \"We can't push other tables who are in front of you back because of your group's sluggishness.  Being stuck in traffic will take them about half an hour to get here. I'll have to cancel your table and bring in the next one\".  To her colleague Anna said \"Bring in the next one\".  

Before I continue, I must explain that I'm clinically diagnosed with anxiety.  This means that I'm easily anxious under pressure.  I'm also not trying to get sympathy.  I know how busy they can be.  I understand the situation and that they couldn't help it.  I'd also like to mention that Anna's attitude was not pleasant from the get-go.

When my group (same seven out of ten of us) finally got to the restaurant.  I wasn't able to properly relay the situation to one of them at the time.  Let's call her K.  K was told by either Anna or one of the hostesses what happened.  I was trying to calm myself down and K assured to me that everything will be alright, and that all I had to do was to relax and not worry.  Anna had an awkward look on her face.  I brushed it off.  K then told Anna that I have anxiety. She said this to clear the air of things.  Suddenly, Anna looked at me and said, \"Well we don't serve people with anxiety.  You better step back over there (near the exit) and chill.\".

WOW, ANNA.  Firstly, you don't serve people with anxiety?  You just showed yourself as a prejudiced and ignorant human being.  I don't care if you are like that as a person, you're AT WORK in the CUSTOMER SERVICE FIELD.  You said this to a CUSTOMER.  You're supposed to be professional in a workplace.  Where did you customer service manners go?  Anna somewhat lacks common sense it seems.

The remaining people in the group were close by.  Anna immediately had a change of heart and said-- again, not exactly her words, \"So since they're close by I can seat you now.\".  Anna, did you finally realized that you messed up and then you tried to sugarcoat the situation?  Needless behaviour from a HEAD HOSTESS, meaning that she was technically the leader of the host crew.  

On the bright side, our server Shanon (I believe that this is her name) as well as another server (my apologies, I forgot her name!) made the dining experience memorable.  I should just forget about the Anna fiasco, but it must be addressed.

TL;DR: 
Head hostess displayed horrible customer service (prejudice and ignorance against those with anxiety/mental illness) due to lack of communication within their team.  Our table was almost canceled."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a birthday. The wait time was 10 minutes on a Sunday evening.... arriving at 5:45. It was 20 minutes and parties of a similar size who checked in after were sat first. Our booth was past the bar area and the seats were covered in crumbs. We had no silverware when we were sat but it did come with the bread. Our service was ok...she was nice. Her timing was off but considering waiting tables while pregnant is a challenge....she did ok. Our food arrived fine but we had ordered chicken OTS with the four cheese pasta and it arrived 20 minutes after the entrees and it was bland. I asked for a manager to bring this kitchen issue to his attention, he never showed up. When the server who dropped off our food didn't have the chicken with him, he confirmed we were missing it but it was 20 minutes for it to arrive. We had finished eating by then. We did dessert to-go. Not sure we will return to this location."}
{"text":"First we went out because it was my mother in law's birthday and my husband's. Absolutely HORRIBLE hostesses. Just a bit of advice... if you want to talk about a customer wait until they can't hear you or read your lips. They were rude. I called ahead asking if it would be busy, they said it shouldn't a problem. When we arrived they said it would take 2 hours for a table. My father in law went in no more than 15 minutes later and asked for Why two tables were empty and if we could just sit there. The hostesses rudely said yes and we were able to seat IMMEDIATELY. We sat down at the table around 6:45 and ordered the food around 6:50. My son got his food at 7:40 and IT WAS AFTER I had asked for it to be brought out as soon as possible. It was corn dogs and fries. There were several tables that sat before us and were served. We did not receive our food until 8:00. The food was cold and the salmon had MULTIPLE bones in it. One of our guests had to LEAVE without even being able to sit and eat because we had waited so long. She had to ask for it to be boxed. The manager didn't even say a word about it. The manager didn't even act like she cared and she looked disheveled. The standards at this restaurant are equivalent to a fast food restaurant, but with colder food. I will continue to tell everyone and anyone not to visit this location if they ever want to be satisfied. A waste of $110, while no one at the party got to eat a good and warm meal. We were disgusted."}
{"text":"I called before and they said they don't do reservations. When I got there, the line was almost out the door with 30-40 people in the lobby alone. I'm almost certain that had to be a fire hazard. Told to come back 30-45 minutes to just get the notifier or my spot would be not in the que anymore. Came back and told another hour and forty five minutes. Total elapsed time to be seated, two hours and fifteen minutes. Our waitress came and was below average for that fancy of a restaurant. Rushed us and came back with my fiances drink in and out of the cup. Got snappy when i asked for clarification on the menu. 

Maybe they should consider reservations because the two to three hour wait times are asinine and poor world class service. Another tip, hire staff that will provide world class service. As someone who has worked in customer service for 3 years, this was not world class service. I probably wont be returning and be taking my business elsewhere where i feel valued."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is one of those things that, to me, sounds better than it ultimately turns out. 

The Cheesecake is good, but the rest of the food is hit or miss. The menu is huge and difficult to comprehend. Portions are on the large side. The restaurant itself is massive, with really high ceilings and decor that reminds me of the classier venues in Vegas.

Summary: Definitely edible, but not my favorite place in town for the money."}
{"text":"It has an interesting decor. The business casual dress of the staff adds a unique flavor. They have a large lunch/dinner menu that won't disappoint. 
The dessert menu lives up to the reputation."}
{"text":"Based on the ratio of positive and negative reviews I guess we got lucky. Immediate seating for my family of four at 6:20pm on a Tuesday. The hostess was pleasant upon our arrival, and she wished us a good evening as we left. Our waiter, Sean, was courteous and attentive. My Cobb salad was tasty and large. My wife enjoyed her Asian chicken salad & her tiny $10 margarita, and the children seemed to enjoy the pulled pork sandwich with fries and the kids menu chicken strips with fresh fruit. My water glass never went empty which is a major factor for me. Haven't tried the take home cheese cake yet, but in the past it has always been yummy.

We had a huge booth away from the bar and TV which was nice because I found myself enjoying my family instead of the basketball game on TV.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Always a good time here. Amazing cheesecake (salted caramel), prompt service and no complaints! The grilled steak medallions on the skinnylicious menu was a small serving but tasty. The cheesecake was so rich we split one slice 3 ways. Nice to be next to the Atlantis show outside."}
{"text":"I've had good meals here before, but today was not one of those days.  We ordered over $100 of food to go and the food was terrible.  The California cheesesteak was terrible!  The meat was disgusting, tough and just plain terrible.  The chicken enchiladas were horribly bland and the rice literally tasted like cardboard.  I've never been this disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"Best cheesecake I ever had! The waiter is very kind and we took his recommendation of banana cream cheesecake. 

Also really like the pre-dinner bread. It's black bread coated with oat and honey, warm, and served with butter. Sooooo good!

Shrimp pasta is good. But not as impressive as the above two. Otherwise I would give five stars. Shrimps are big and fresh, properly cooked, but besides shrimp, there's only tomato and red pepper in the pasta. It'll taste better if more veggies like onion, broccoli, mushroom etc could be added."}
{"text":"The menu is massive.

Sarah T was a patient and attentive server.

The food was plentiful, well seasoned and casually prompt.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"OMG I am in food coma still!  The service is great, the food wonderful and the dessert to die for!"}
{"text":"Nyöppnat och fräscht! Personalen väldigt trevliga. Perfekt att avsluta en ordentlig shoppingrunda med. Steak Diane och Lemon meringue cheesecake var super!"}
{"text":"The Ahi Carpaccio was amazing, and the food was better than good. We had a very late dinner even for Vegas standards so it seemed like we were imposing."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was by far my worst experience in a restaurant. My date and I both ordered the filet (I would think one of the most expensive meals on the menu). The steaks were delicious. The potatoes came \"garnished\" with onion rings. I was eating an onion ring and couldn't chew it. The \"onion\" was the skin of the onion. I had to pull it out of my mouth (in front of my date, on New Years eve)  I let our waiter know and showed him the skin. He just danced around it and barely acknowledged my complaint. He proceeded to take our leftovers and box them up, and brought back our check. I asked him if he could accommodate me at all. He said he would grab his manager KIM. A couple minutes later Kim came to our table and asked me how my steak was. I told her it was delicious and then proceeded to let her know what had happened. She said sorry and that she would let the cooks know, in a super condescending way. She said it was a \"garnish\" and was glad that everything else was ok and told me to have a Happy New Year. I was shocked that she didn't offer me even a desert or to accommodate me in any way. I had to make a little more fuss about it, embarrassing me again in front of my date. She then asked me if I wanted more onions rings. What??? Why would I want more of something that I just had a bad experience with and after I already had my leftovers boxed up. She finally says, I can give you the drinks (which totaled 8.50). Any time I have ever had an incident in a restaurant, I have always been fortunate to have someone actually care about a mistake. I completely understand mistakes happen, BUT, at least own up and take accountability when they do. KIM, the manager, did not want to own up at all. 
I definitely wouldn't recommend this particular location at the Kierland Commons, to anyone. Kim and her waiter Alan should be ashamed of themselves for how they handled this situation. I will be contacting corporate about this as well. I'm sure they won't be happy to hear about how I was treated."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was just ok. The appetizer came out pretty quick, but the main dishes took a while. The quality of the food was just ok. I had the jambalaya which besides being a little spicy there was really not much flavor. I should have gone with my usual bang bang chicken and shrimp. The crab and artichoke dip was tasty though. Probably won't be going back anytime soon. Grimaldis is just a few doors down."}
{"text":"The food was divine! The cheesecake and the fresh basil, cheese, and tomato flatbread exceeded my expectations! My waiter was very kind and welcoming. I would defiantly go there again!"}
{"text":"I had the Ahi Tartare and the Chicken Taco Lettuce Wraps. The Ahi was totally small. It didn't look like the picture and had barely any ahi in it, but it tasted good. The chicken wraps were okay. A good amount of food, and the sauces were good, but they did fall apart. The cheesecake was awesome. I got the reeses cup cheesecake which was tasty. Overall wasn't too bad tasting. The service however, was horrible. We had one server lady who was not very personable and forgot to put my ahi in. I had to remind her when the other food arrived and it was supposed to be an appetizer. Then they switched servers on us to another lady. She was slightly better, at least more personable, but still not that great."}
{"text":"If you are looking a flavor explosion in your mouth.  Open wide here comes Cheescake Factory. Everything I have tried here is really good.  The tiramisu cheesecake is the best I have ever had.  Even if you do not like cheesecake you will love the tiramisu. The standouts for the appetizers are the buffalo blasts.  They are like shredded chicken deep fried with cheese around it dipped in buffalo sauce. Oh it's so so good. I also like the factory burger for my main dish. It's a hamburger in sour dough bread with onions with fries. Trust me it's really good. My wife and I always go on eachothers birthdays so the workers can sing to us. Great food, service and setting.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Evelyn was by far the best waitress I've had in a very long time I had the ribeye steak rare the steak was cooked to perfection it was absolutely delicious I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory on Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Saturday evening and was promptly told to wait one hour; the place was definitely popular!

Staff was friendly and accommodating and portion sizes were large. Our food came out approximately half an hour after we put in our orders, and the waiter graciously offered us extra bread to tie us over in the meantime. Although the food quality might not be considered gourmet by any means, for the price, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Gawd, I hate this place. Ok, the cheesecake is decent. But the entire place is such a machine and not a very well oiled one at that. 
But my #1 pet PEEVE about this place, and it COMPLETELY irks me, is that they have advertisements in their menus!!  Are you KIDDING me?! For that alone, I feel like they should be paying me to eat there. 

The food is just okay. It is what it is. An \"upscale\", soulless chain. 

Unless absolutely forced to by a huge group of crazy people that don't enjoy eating, will I eat here. Ok, maybe an exaggeration. If I had to choose between Subway and this, I guess I'd go for Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at this location. I have been to the other locations in Vegas and I wanted to try this one in Summerlin.    

We arrived and were promptly seated after  a few minutes. 
We were there during a shift change and had two servers. Both were attentive, friendly, and professional. They made our visit enjoyable.

The food was awesome! After I decided what to order. The menu selection is huge.
My wife had the chicken taquitos, which were very authentic and dang good!
I had the Steak Diane and herb crusted Salmon combo. The Steak with the sauce and mushrooms was very flavorful. But the star of the meal for me was the Salmon. I normally don't order Salmon at restaurants but the description sounded good and our server indicated that it was wild caught, which was the selling point for me.
I'm just going to say that it's the best Salmon I've ever had at a restaurant!  Nough said!

Overall this is the best experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I highly recommend a visit to this location."}
{"text":"A half hour wait for a sandwich to be served. No warning. No attention. The excuse: this chain's kitchen is unable to serve individual customers and a large party simultaneously. So why are they in the restaurant business?"}
{"text":"Dirty silverware..dirty glasses and the bathroom was absolutely disgusting..I'd think twice about eating here..cleanliness has to be a top priority."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this Cheesecake Factory location in the last 6 months, and I must say, without a doubt, it's a classy unpretentious restaurant.  The staff are friendly and inviting.  We ordered a variety appetizers, soup, salad, fish, steak, chicken and all were excellent - both in taste and presentation!  This is a place I would take my house guests to."}
{"text":"The food was SO good and we had an exceptional waitress named Marcie. Its nice to know there are people out there that still believe in great customer service. Thank you for making our experience so lovely after a rough day and making us smile.  We will be driving back even though its not close to our home."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give any place 5 stars, so I just went with 4 for now.  But that could change if things improve from last time I went.  I had gone twice previously and hadn't been overly impressed.  It seemed a little overpriced and the food just seemed to be slightly above average.  But we went this past weekend with some family and it was AMAZING.  I tried something that I normally would never get, which was the Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta, and it was incredible.  For an appetizer my wife and I shared the Avocado Egg Rolls, and they too were very good.  To drink I had a Typhoon Punch, which was really tasty.  My wife got the 4 cheese pasta, and she loved it.

My only regret was I didn't save room for dessert.  Next time I will!

Overall I'm not sure it's entirely worth what we paid (final total came out to $65, which was for 2 pasta orders, 1 appetizer, and my alcoholic drink), but I think we paid a little bit more than most Cheesecake Factory locations due to its location inside Caesar's Palace.  BUT, we will definitely be going again in the future."}
{"text":"The desserts were soo yummi!!!! We had carrot cake and red velvet cheesecake! Definitely coming back!!  Our waiter was soo friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"My shrimp scampi with pasta was super salty.  I always order the same thing, and it's way too hit and miss."}
{"text":"From over two hours away, We had calvin c as our waiter and he was amazing! Such a great, friendly guy, that is amazing at his job! Defiantly needs some recognition. Everything was good but thanks to Calvin we had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Un considerate staff , wait times are a joke and not accurate , the line to get in is not that long to make the wait 3 hours . Owners probably trying to make a big thing out of the restaurant so making people wait for it . 
Will never step foot there again ."}
{"text":"The food was good as usual, as was the service. I was only able to eat half of my hamburger and most of the small side salad. The tiny bit of salad was placed in a box to take home, but not my hamburger, this was discovered when we got home. For some reason our waiter decided not to box up my burger. After paying as much as we did, I'm pretty upset that they would do this. I don't think we'll be visiting this location anymore."}
{"text":"Jacob rocked!  We sat on the patio, we love the patios in Arizona! Jacob engaged our two children, which is always the sign of a great server and creates great dining memories for the kids! 

We started with dessert first and Jacob brought our cheesecakes out super fast. Very attentive and courteous to listen to our kids' drawn out stories. He even had extra bread sent out to us, yummy!  

The food is always great at the Factory, but the service Jacob provided made our visit Fantastic!  Thanks Jacob!!"}
{"text":"Oooh this place always has my taste buds going!! I recommend there weekly soups and amazing salads (: and of course there cheesecake and Ice teas. You should never leave dissatisfied here"}
{"text":"Really really bad service. Slow, lots of mistakes. I'll do carry out in the future.
Didn't bring out bread until asked twice, brought empty bottle of steak sauce, burger ordered medium well came out red with bun soaked in blood."}
{"text":"I don't care for this place all that much. But my friends do, and I can see how uneducated normal folk get sucked into the \"Cheesecake Factory Vortex of Doom\".

i came here for a get together with friends the other night. The menus are a bit much with all that advertisements in them. The menu is eclectic, but I definitely think the prices are borderline gouging. 

The portions are big, that is correct. But, chicken is cheap, and a plate of it with mash and gravy for $16 is a bit much. 

The cheesecakes are delicious, all though we were a bit bummed to find out that the cheesecake is not made in house. My friends first choice was said to be unavailable because it was frozen. That means the place is not a Cheesecake Factory, but merely a Cheesecake Depot, where the real factory trucks in the baked goodies. 

I strongly feel this place is WAY overpriced for what it offered. It is a casual, family restaurant with upscale dining prices. If they had a better product, I could stand spending $60 for 2, but not when it's a sandwich and Chicken and Biscuits."}
{"text":"I love love love the chicken Cesar salads here and of course the Cheesecake. Service is always really fast and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I don't mind waiting for a table when it's busy. If I didn't like the wait, I would go elsewhere. But when you are finally seated and then you get to watch servers run around you for 15 minutes and not even one stops to greet you, THAT is very annoying. I finally had to get up, go to the hostess station, and threaten to walk out in 60 seconds if a server didn't show up. Well, that got their attention, or so I thought. Then, the server comes and complains to us (!!) that he was taken out of his section and \"thrown\" at us. Thrown?? Sorry to be a burden, pal. Your comment directly affects your tip unless maybe you don't understand how a fleeting patron-server relationship works. You be nice - I be nice. It's that simple - not a long-term commitment. We haven't been back since and it would take a lot to get us to walk into another Cheesey-cake Factory. Why not just call it the \"Factory\" if that's how you treat people?"}
{"text":"I been to a few different Cheesecake Factory and this ranks probably at the top.  Not only did they seat up near the fish tank (trust me...this helps when you have two kids), they cut the bread and banana in small pieces for my kids while we waited for the entrees.  I had the chicken piccata which was awesome...highly recommended.

We even got to watch the Caesars statue show while dining."}
{"text":"It's disappointing to say that Cheesecake Factory didn't exceed my expectations. I've been an avid Cheesecake Factory fan for years but now I realize why I never compliment the service. 

The food is amazing as well as their fantastic cheesecakes. There's a large variety so there really is a little something for everyone.

However, I've come to realize that I have the same issues almost every time I come as far as the amount of time I'm waiting on food/service. 

Today I happened to want to surprise my family with some cheesecake and tried calling ahead numerous times to put in a to go order and no one picked up the phone. I understood and shrugged thinking that it must be busy. I am a server and working in the food/restaurant industry has given me a very forgiving perspective. Come to find that when I walk in the door, it is completely dead and the hostess is letting the phone ring nonstop without picking it up. 

Now this could be the hostess' fault for ignoring her duties and I will always come back for the food--but I urge Cheesecake Factory to put their employees to be the absolute best they can be."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Service is generally pretty good, but not always. Best service is at the bar. Yes you can eat at the bar. We have been here over a dozen times, and are very critical of restaurants. The Variety of food here is excellent and everything is very well prepared. I would recommend all of the cheese cake factories we have eaten at. The food is consistently excellent. Very popular restaurant and you may have to wait to be seated, which is why the bar is a good choice since you can often get immediate service without waiting."}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I visited a cheese cake factory but this visit made me realize there are so many other better restaurants out there for the price. 

We ordered the flat bread with pears, blue cheese, pecans, and baby spinach. It was good but the portion was pretty small. We also ordered the herb crusted salmon salad. I expected the salmon to be warm but it came out cold. Most salmon salads I'm used to the salmon is nice and warm and cooked medium but it seems like cheese cake factory's salmon was pre-cooked, over cooked and sat in a refrigerator until served. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and was not attentive.

Overall I'd rather choose a mom and pop shop spend the same amount of money for better food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything I have had on the menu is really good, particularly their fish and chips and their burgers. They cook the burgers perfectly and they have great ingredients on them... my favorites are the mac and cheese burger and the Americana burger, but their BBQ ranch sauce is awesome as well! Cheesecakes are awesome as well.... Out of the ones I have had, the best are the white chocolate blueberry and the red velvet..... had great service here as well!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at the cheese cake factory in Henderson Las Vegas. We were seated promptly  The   staff was courteous and very welcoming. Our waiter was attentive and very informative regarding the food on the menu. We ordered shrimp gumbo on noodles. Very tasty and a little spicy. Would highly recommend  the Cheese Cake Factory in Henderson Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Au fond du centre commercial du Ceasars Palace, il y a Cheesecake Factory, caché par une grande fontaine. Pour y arriver, il en faut du courage, il y a pas mal de marche et la tentation de s'arrêter en route est de plus en plus forte avec les autres restaurants de ce centre. Mais la marche vaut le coup, les plats sont servis généreusement, le service est sympa, on blague aussi avec nous avec quelques anecdotes sympa et les conseils sont avisés.
L'addition est un peu élevée, mais reste dans le même ordre que dans d'autres restaurants du centre.
PS : Rien à voir avec le Cheesecake Factory de la série Big Bang Therory ;) Les uniformes et l'ambiance n'est pas la même. D'ailleurs, je rajouterai que la musique y est un peu trop fort"}
{"text":"Horrible experience first the bathroom was nasty with no toilet paper and i let the server know idk if the cleaned it then we ordered and i ordered my steak medium well and it came to me charred on the outside and medium rare in the inside so i sent it back and then the manager came over and apologized and had them make me a new one and gave me a crown and coke for free so i was ok... so i ordered a piece of cheesecake while i waited... the cheesecake was awful it was grainy and not set it should of stayed in the cooler at least another 30 mins to set but they served it instead which shows that they dont care about their products and whether it was good to serve to their customer I had two bites of it and pushed it away then i waited 20 mins and the steak came again and it was medium.... so i sent it all back...again not what i asked for....  so i asked for the manager and he came and i explained what was wrong and what happened and he apologized which was fine and he comped my meal but still i left there the same way I came in which was hungry.... The manager and waitress were nice and tried to fix it but obviously the rest of the staff doesnt care about the product or its presentation to the customer and they take no pride in their work."}
{"text":"My daughter and I used to eat here often. There are so many choices, and even though it can be expensive for us, it was so good that it was worth it. For the last several months, however, this location has been getting worse and worse.

We often go fairly late. We try to come no later than an hour before closing, because the staff get very prickly, and sometimes very rude. To me, if you're open until ten, you need to be open until ten. If I come in at nine, you shouldn't treat me like I'm a jerk for it. We've had staff give us the silent treatment, and have even had one be pretty rude. We don't get bread about 80% of the time, and I think it may be a passive-aggressive move. Does that sound paranoid? Evs. This place really needs a staff meeting.

The service is bad, but the food is the real issue at this location. My daughter always gets the four cheese pasta. The last three times it has been weird. Once she only got half the amount as usual, and the other two times it was super liquidy with barely any pasta. I ordered a well-done hamburger that came out almost raw. That is the only time in my life that I've sent a food back. I always order a hamburger well-done when I'm out, but I am willing to eat it if it's at least above medium. I could not even think about eating that burger. The manager came out and apologized and assured me that it wasn't cooked enough (oh, gee, I'm happy I wasn't making that up...), but she offered no kind of discount. So I just got to wait half an hour longer (not exaggerating) for what had already taken half an hour to get in the first place. There are other issues as well; chicken sandwiches with fatty, gristly filets, salads with iffy to rotten lettuce, reluctance to provide enough ketchup or tartar sauce.

This place used to have standards, but now it's not even as clean as it used to be. I'm going to miss you, Cheesecake Factory. Let me know if you ever make things better."}
{"text":"Been to the Cheesecake Factory on the strip and on Rampart and the food was amazing and service was excellent. Paid $8 to valet just to eat at the Cheesecake Factory at the outlet mall sat at the bar top. I have been gone for a week traveling for work so it was the first time my husband and I got to sat down and catch up with each other and we decided to go here for lunch. Bartender was not friendly seemed to be inconvenienced that we sat down at the bar to eat. The lady who brought our bread was nice but the bread was burned. My husband enjoyed his turkey burger but my shrimp pasta was not good at all the shrimp was very rubbery and overcooked and the asparagus was not very good and limp. Bartender never came back to ask how our food was or I would have politely told him that I did not like my entree which he should have known as I did not finish it. He must have been in a rush to get us out of the bar as he already presented us our bill before we even got our entree in a glass cup in front of us!!! At the end of the meal my water glass was empty and did not even ask to refill it therefore we just paid the check and left. It is very unfortunate for the money I spent on our lunch to not only be satisfied with the food but also the service. Lastly we sat at the end of the bar by the well or the servers pick up the drinks and unfortunately it was surrounded by fruit flies as I kept swatting them away from our area of the bar. Wish I could have gotten our $40 back for this meal."}
{"text":"Asked for refills on my hot chocolate but I was not informed that I would be charged for again, no refills on the hot chocolate, didn't see it until my bill came. Old fashion burger was good but the fries seem to have been sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"with a name like Cheesecake Factory I HAD to try it!
I kind of wish I had just kept wishing to try it, so it didn't ruin it for me.
NOT WORTH THE PRICE
Food was OK at best and service was less than par. Not much variety in food choices either
Not a fan...  Bummer :(
PARKING IS HARD TOO BECAUSE IT IS AT THE MALL"}
{"text":"I have previously enjoyed this place but tonight, it was bad...heres the storyHello,
We visited your restaurant for our 2nd wedding anniversary, because we have always enjoyed our food and time there.  However, tonight was a bit disappointing.  My husband spent more than i would have on his dinner, a steak and it showed up on a small plate, with basil or something, that looked old. The steak itself had lots of fat on it he had to trim off himself, and the steak overall did not taste great.  This was after waiting about 5 minutes for our server to notice we were not eating because my husbands side dish had not arrived.  When she finally brought it over it was plain french fries! Are you kidding me?!  For $25.00!!!  What a joke.  They looked like frozen, out of a bag fries.  Secondly our service was pretty bad, we asked for straws, they were pretty much thrown at us, and so was the bottle of ketchup.  Wasn't the nice dining experience we were hoping for."}
{"text":"Charmaine was our server! Awful experience!!!! First she never went to our table to greet us, then when I finally went to the hostess she told the server that we had been there for over 20 min, then she came with an attitude to get our drinks and walk away without even ask if we were ready to order, when she came we told her that we were ready for some appetizer and she said well I'm not ready yet! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?! With our food I ordered a burger with a salad instead and the salad never made it to the table, with our dessert we want it the chocolate cake with a chocolate milk shake split for 2, that never happened! In the end really disappointed and upset! Never again I'm going there."}
{"text":"Had to wait for a bit because most of the guests were celebrating with family and their recent graduates.  We ordered the Avocado Rolls for appetizers and they were awesome.  For the main meal, I had the Meatloaf and it's so much food, I couldn't finish it.  But I did have room for the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake and now I have diabetes. (Just kidding).  Definitely a restaurant I'd stop by again whenever I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the cheese ale factory and I Recently took my friend who had never been and she was easily over whelmed by the large menu. Thankfully our server was more then helpful in narrowing it down for her and she was stoked with all her choices. We of course had left overs and of course we got cheesecake to go. Over all awesome meal!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it is always because it is just a convenient option. As far as chain restaurants go, it is fine. The decor is always awful and quite frankly I have no idea what it has to do with cheesecake. I also wonder why they make their servers dress in white. It seems like a bad idea because they will always look dirty. You just can't keep white clean in a restaurant. I think they want you to feel like you're in heaven but if so, it must be the dodgy part. 

The food is decent but I find their portions to be way too large creating inflated prides. Also, their menu is so large it seems impossible for them to make anything amazing food-wise. I do like their cheesecake but I question the amount of unnecessary ingredients they use. 

We ordered the white bean chicken chili from the Skinny menu (because we wanted normal portions). And we also shared the kabob appetizer. Both were among the most enjoyable things I've gotten there. The chili was very good and a bit spicy. The kabob could have been better but I wasn't expecting authentic kabob taste. The meat was the disappointing part. The yogurt sauce was good though.   

Our waitress last nice gave us an extra 25 minutes to decide on dessert since we weren't ready the first time. I'm not sure where she went but we didn't even see her to flag down in that time period. 

Overall this place is fine in a pinch but it will never be among my favorites."}
{"text":"The food was good, however the service was not. We waited 15 minutes before our waitress even took our order, and it went downhill from there. After my mom received her lunch and had time to ask for dressing TWICE, the waitress realized that I had not received mine yet. She came back and admitted that she had \"totally spaced\" putting my order in and it would be right out. So then the manager visited our table and gave us the obligatory \"sorry\" but didn't offer any adjustments to our bill...not even a free dessert or drink. After finishing my lunch, I asked for a couple boxes so I could take the leftovers home and was shocked at what happened next. Our waitress actually walked up with 2 boxes, handed me one and said \"oh gosh, I was supposed to bring you 2...but this one is for someone else so I will be right back.\" Needless to say, I was utterly shocked. We left full of good food but the bad taste in both of our mouths is impossible to overlook. Sorry Cheesecake Factory...We won't be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"They finally have a kids menu!!!  We used to go to Cheesecake all the time with our kids.  We basically got sick of paying for adult entrees for our kiddos and family dinner out would cost well over $100.  Cheesecake is not a place that my husband and I would choose if we were out alone.  So aside from the occasional lunch salad while shopping or getting cheesecake to-go, we haven't been here in a long time.

My #3 son chose Cheesecake for his birthday dinner.  Items ordered included calamari (same at all chains), fried mac and cheese appetizer (delish), Chicken Maderia (sweet, tender chicken), Low-calorie chicken and asparagus (boring, but served it's purpose), 4 cheese pasta with chicken(huge portion, but again same as any chain), buffalo blaster (fried  boneless chicken wing something), kids quesadilla (over priced for tortilla and cheese), farmhouse cheese burger (good, not great).

We had 4 cheesecakes...Key lime, red velvet, apple caramel struesel, reeses peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake.  All were FANTASTIC!

The cheesecake will always be the 1 thing that keeps us coming back.  I still think everything is overpriced, but at least they are consistent. 

Service was good this time.  When we left, they were on a wait, but there were tables open everywhere.  Clearly a staffing issue, but I am sure frustrating to customers."}
{"text":"I took my brother, his girlfriend, and our mother out to lunch this weekend. I was seriously so excited because I had been on a Cheesecake Factory kick the last 2 months and was happy my family was coming. It was a Sunday and it really wasn't that busy around 3:00. The server we had took 20 minutes to even come to the table after we were seated. Then only offered water and bread and walked away before I could even get the other drink orders in, and seemed irritated after we had asked for more than water. Both bathrooms were absolutely disgusting, there was vomit all over both, and it had clearly been there for a little while. My mother ordered the fish tacos, and apparently was the only one who made a safe choice. The 3 of us however, all ordered a meal with chicken and all 3 of us got food poisoning. I don't know what happened on Sunday, but I am seriously so disappointed in that entire meal. Normally this place is 5 stars, but this is absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"The main reason I am giving this restaurant three out of five stars is because of their wait times. The wait times here are absolutely atrocious and they do NOT take reservations which I find absolutely ridiculous. It's their company policy that there is not wait times, however, this location is the only Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh and gets too much attention and they should start doing it. I like to take my 62 year old mother here and she does not want to wait over an hour to get a seat when on medication and with a bad hip. We came here once before a concert to to see the Transiberian Orchestra. They told us the wait would be 45 minutes and we waited 1 hour and 15 minutes and eventually left. The second time was today, after the failed to take my reservation I walk in and the place was packed like sardines. I didn't even bother asking how long of a wait, as it was probably over an hour. My moms birthday dinner was fast food now because this place (as well as it's surrounding restaurants) are all too busy. I don't know what it is about the south side, people just love this area. 

I love the food here and that's the reason it's popular. Their chicken marsala is hands down the best dish I've ever had at any restaurant, beating out traditional, family owned restaurants and the works. The cheesecake as well is their mean thing, it's excellent and although severely overpriced they at least give you a huge slice. They've got a huge menu to pick from and their alcohol is also excellent with probably the best margarita's I've ever had.

If you want to eat here, I recommend going on a secluded business day when everyone is working. in the past, I used to get seated in 10-20 minutes, but in the past couple months the wait times have been unacceptable. I also don't trust how well their cooks and staff can keep up with so many people if they cook the food well enough, I mean this place gets stupidly busy."}
{"text":"I've had better... I went for the Asian Salad on the \"skinny\" menu. It was ok, really large portions, but lacking flavor. Panera does a better asian salad."}
{"text":"This is an elegant place. I had a good time with my family there. The prices are reasonable.  The customer service is extremely great. However, we had to wait a little long (sometimes) to get the food."}
{"text":"Food is fine and tastes the same as all other Cheesecake Factory's.  That is not the issue.  The issue I have is the way this location was designed.  The front door is near valet to the mall where only 100 cars can park. The other 10,000 parking spaces are located elsewhere and lead directly into the mall.  But the back door to the Cheesecake factory is closer to the actual mall and much more convenient for people to enter and leave the restaurant.  Half the seating in this location is located in the row going from the check-in to the back door.  And this is the only seating where they allow children.  So as your eating you literally have 100's of people walking back and forth past your table to enter and leave the restaurant.  No one uses the front door since it leads out to the street and the mall is the other direction.  Now add a stroller with a sleeping baby in it.  We usually ask for a table away from others so our child is not a distraction.  We know what it was like before we had a child.  But this place was packed and we had to take the only available table which was a booth.  So we placed the stroller plush against the front of the booth since our child was asleep.  But now with 100s of people coming in and out the back door we closed traffic to one way since the stroller was there.  Now the manager noticed the interruption of bodies moving because of the stroller and was about to ask us to move it down the hall when he realized our son was asleep in it.  So I asked him to make the back door an exit only like most businesses.  And he tried explaining it is a fire hazard which is not true.  it is only a fire hazard if it is locked and you can not get out.  So this meal was certainly not relaxing and not enjoyable.  Trying to make sure people do not run into the stroller and eat at the same time is not fun.  They are more worried about losing customers because they cant actually find the front door to this location than making the people their comfortable.  And if they had told us from the get go their was no place to sit with a stroller we would have gone somewhere else. Lola's is across the street and has the best cajun food around."}
{"text":"Well, my family and I decided on the Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner. When we arrived, the hostess cheerfully greeted us and swiftly seated us. My two grandchildren ordered sliders and French fries with ketchup on the side. My wife ordered lettuce wraps. Now I need to tell you how picky and particular she is with this dish. After the first bite, her comment was \"this is the best lettuce wraps I've ever had.\" My daughter ordered a grilled vegetable salad which was excellent. Last but not least, I ordered Boulliabaise, over a large bed and portion of spegattini rested fresh muscles, clams, shrimp and white fish. Another excellent dish and choice experience a fine meal. We will make the Cheesecake Factory a special place for us to dine. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor awesome. Wait staff great with service. Food was mediocre and overpriced. The cheesecake was even mediocre. Average meal around 15$. I don't think that we would personally go back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty similar whatever cheesecake you go to. Their curbside- they made me wait til there was another car outside so she only had to make one trip with the food. Come on. If I had known they would do that I would have gone in to get it. Normally I would give 3-4 stars but they lost points for making me wait an extra 10min for no reason."}
{"text":"I like Cheesecake Factory. I like the consistency in the food.  You know what to expect and you know its going to be good. Wide variety of food ranging from the usual burgers and pizzas to asian and mexican cusine . The cashew chicken is the bomb though I love the Crispy Chicken sandwich with the Buffalo sauce. The tons of fun burger is another favorite. Dessert is, what else cheesecake and more cheesecake though they have 30 or more different types of cheesecake and other types of dessert too. Wait times can run up to an hour or even more on weekends. But you do have the Chandler Fashion Square next door where you can kill some time. Service is usually excellent and you can be sure you will be well looked after."}
{"text":"I spent Memorial weekend in Las Vegas. I had a great time people watching and outlet mall shopping. One evening before I noticed it was quite late and I needed to eat. I chose Cheesecake Factory because the food was familiar and reasonably priced. The service staff was friendly and attentive despite the late hour. 

The most interesting part of the evening were the people around me like the loud, obnoxious men who kept shouting \"It's Trump's America\" or the girl who literally took a nap in the bread basket. Love Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"At this Cheesecake Factory the service was very good, the food tasted good, unfortunately my son and I had food poisoning after our evening meal. I had the southwest Chicken Sandwich, and my son had the Macaroni and cheese burger."}
{"text":"Wasn't very busy when we went in,  still took them 15mins after we where seated to take our order and that was only because we said we wanted to order when we could get hold of them. Ordered 2basic meals (pasta and burger)  waited more than 30mins and even then order was brought out incomplete. 

Food was bad, pasta was mainly sauce with a few pieces of pasta swimming around, burger was subpar and well below most places even with the higher price.  Went in with getting cheesecake in mind and left without getting since everything we asked for took so long to appear. 

Will not be going back here"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory, and I really enjoyed it. The environment was classy, and the waitress who waited on me was very nice. There is patio seating, but I thought the inside was just as good. Finally got to try a prickly pear margarita, which I had been wanting to try for a long time. They have a lot of good options for both food and beverages. The choose your own omelette I ordered was nice and fluffy. Would like to return in the future."}
{"text":"The lunch Caesar Salad is bomb. It's a large portion and comes in a chilled bowl filled full of fresh crisp romaine lettuce. They're really good about having lettuce that is not brown or wilted. Perfectly crunchy croutons with tangy garlic dressing. I like to add shrimp but you can add chicken. Also comes with a dusting of grated parmigiana and you can get fresh cracked pepper at the table from the server. Extra fresh cracked pepper is best. Just slide your bowl to the edge of the table otherwise you'll have pepper all over the table and in your lap. Give it a try it's bomb."}
{"text":"I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory in Milwaukee for years and loved it so I was very excited when one opened in Madison. I went once a year ago and was very disappointed in the skinnylicious menu. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad and it was very blah...not like the higher calorie one. Half way thru I noticed that I hadn't tasted any chicken so I called the waiter over. They brought back a dish of chicken with apologies but didn't take off the price of the meal or even discount it. I complained on the corporate page but again didn't get a call, email...nothing. Now, a year later I finally went back and ordered the skinnylicious chicken enchiladas. They were very bland and tasteless and the chicken was very chewy. The waitress never even asked how our food was. Probably would be a good idea to drop this part of the menu as you do it poorly.....
I doubt I'll go back......
By the way, my husbands hamburger was excellent he said."}
{"text":"I think The CCF is a little too expensive for bar food, and I got the worst headache from my drink with what was supposed to be Grey Goose vodka. They need to check there bottles. I don't get headaches from top shelf liquor normallly. The lighting in this restaurant is horrible. My husband and I  could not even see our menus. OK if you are just hungry and want to spend a lot of money on chicken, burgers and pasta.  My advice is to go to Ruby Tuesday's or Apple Bee's, better value for your money."}
{"text":"You know, I go through phases of getting cheesecake for a couple weeks on and off due to the quality of service, it has gone way down hill, the other day I can get an exact date I was calling in a curbside order a salad, I had given her my specifics to which she seemed frustrated taking my order then I had let her know that I would like extra croutons, she told me she'd have to CHARGE ME FOR CROUTONS?! Since when do you charge for extra croutons? She said since she already put the order through she'd have to ring it in separately, after a couple of years of dealing with inconsistent pricing and customer service I will NOT be returning till the quality goes up.. shame"}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory has a great wide selection of food with large orders that are easy to share with my wife. The service is usually good and we really like sitting out on the outside patio. I highly recommend this location opposed to other locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Celiacs beware. Do not eat here if you have a gluten allergy. Menu items may say gluten free available, but there is way too much contamination or a disconnect in the kitchen concerning how to serve someone with a gluten allergy. I ordered the gluten free pasta carbonara and the supposedly gluten free Godiva chocolate cheesecake. The pasta was a little crunchy and tasteless and I only managed one bite of the cheesecake because it was so incredibly sweet. Then I got sick. I was not happy. I definitely would not recommend this location for people with Celiacs or a gluten allergy."}
{"text":"We dined in for lunch today.  The server, Brett, must've determined that since we ordered so little (margherita flat bread and soup and salad) that we weren't really worth his time.  He alternated between looking like he'd forgotten something and spending time stopping by other tables before he would stop by ours after we caught his eye.  So it was difficult to tell if he was new or just a bad server.  He never really apologized or explained that he forgot our bread or why it took a long time to come out.  When he did come to the table he seemed to be in a hurry and didn't have the time to spend with us.  The food was actually pretty good.  But the experience was spoiled by the bad service.  We ordered so little because we were saving room for dessert.  Which we did order, but he was in such a hurry we had to stop him to tell him that we wanted it.  Then he didn't bring it out correctly.  We ordered cheesecake with just fresh strawberries, it came out with the strawberry sauce on top of the strawberries.  I would normally excuse that kind of error. But he was in such a hurry I don't think he heard me correctly.  But since we doubted he would be coming back anytime soon, we just ate it quickly and paid the bill.  
A lot of the food the other tables were receiving looked really good.  But not so good that we will be trying it anytime soon.  Maybe we'll try another one in another area."}
{"text":"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory but, his last time they sat us by the server area. We could hear everything they were complaining about. The servers were running back and forth like crazy and it was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think. I had the chicken lettuce wraps and my husband had the Shepard's pie. Although,The food was very appetizing. Late that night I woke up with food poisoning. I hadn't had anything else earlier that day to eat so, I came to the conclusion that maybe the chicken was bad. Down and out for 3 days. No fun! Was very displease with this last experience here. It's going to take me a while before I tempt to eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything about this place is good.. Ambience, food, people. We are vegetarians and this place has good options for us. We had avocado egg rolls, Ligurian pesto pasta, spicy chipotle pasta. I am going again and again not just for the items listed in menu but also for the fresh baked bread with butter."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service we have ever had. We always used to look forward to going here while in Vegas but will never go again. 
When we went we were seated straight away even though the entire top section of the restaurant was closed which was unusual for this location. 
After asking for the enchiladas with \"no sliced up peppers or onions on top but sauces would be totally fine\" we received a plate with plain white rice, 3 flour tortillas and some plain unseasoned chicken breast. No tomatillo sauce or salsa at all. When we sent it back the restaurant manager came back 20 min later, mumbled something under his breath and slammed down the same meal, cold with some tomatillo sauce thrown on top. 
Probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Disgraceful."}
{"text":"Kimberly was great and the main reason for the 5 stars. She made our experience enjoyable. She went above and beyond to retrieve ingredient information given our dietary restrictions, checked in w our table frequently, we never felt abandoned. 

We will certainly return, but we'll be sure to request Kim!"}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  It had great food and attentive servers."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar the bartender offered good service"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience. My family and I waited forever. The electronic device to let you know you're ready to be sat didn't work. They gave me another one but didn't program it. Another 25 minutes went by and nothing. If it wasn't my mother-in-laws favorite place to eat, I would have left already. When I went to the desk to see how long we had, our name was crossed off. I complained yet again. Then the girl who originally took our name said \"Sorry your next\". About a minute went by and she forgot and sat another party of 3. How can a 1/2 way Intelligent person forget something one minute later? \"Are you kidding me!!!\"  I will never go there again and hope anyone that reads this takes warning of the bad service."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory offers good food and reliable, attentive service. I like that they offer reduced calorie items. Try the French Country salad and split a dessert to control the caloric damage. They have a tasty skinny margarita. They make good coffee. Also like the burgers and the sweet corn tamales. Exercise after.
One thing - I wish they'd wipe down their menus more often."}
{"text":"Don't eat at this location!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What happend to us tonight was ridiculous! We were waiting one hour and half to be seated and after that we were one hour waiting to get a food. In the end we called manager to talk with him and it turns out that he told us we were waiting only 5 mins.So we  told him that we are unsatisfied and to help us at least with free drink on the house but he couldn't because in his system we were waiting only \"5 mins\", so basiclly he called us liars. Customer service poor. He didn't even say sorry for your waiting or anything. 

Wooow unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"Worst \"take-out\" service EVER!  Hold times on weekends (especially Fridays) are over 10 minutes!  As I write this, I've officially been on hold for 19 minutes and 10 seconds. I wrote this review because this is the 3rd time it has happened. Regretfully there isn't another Cheesecake Factory in the area, that's why we have to go to this location. Should just drive to the Strip! It'll be quicker than dealing with this horrendous service. Could we go somewhere else for dinner? Yes, but that's not the point of this review and I'm craving Portobello Fries...

Sure, we're calling during the \"peak\" hours, but isn't that all restaurants on weekends? No other restaurant in Summerlin has this problem in our experience. Since this is happening EVERY weekend, isn't that an indicator that perhaps they need more staffing? Every time I call, they always say: \"Let me get the manager to help take orders.\"  Duh! Shouldn't they already be involved? 

Finally got Cesar on the phone (total of 21 minutes and some wait). The 2nd star was for his great attitude and exemplary service (thanks Cesar).  Extremely apologetic although not his fault.  He's the only reason I proceeded with the order and was comped a cheesecake. If they keep it up, there's only so much cheesecake to give away before they run out with their subpar service. 

I'll be forwarding this to corporate."}
{"text":"Food....idk what it is about this place but I don't particularly care for their food. Every time we leave I feel as though we have overspent on just ok food. The cheesecake is always good but how much can you eat before you feel sick.

Ambiance....very nice and very clean.

Staff...extremely well trained, efficient, helpful.

Verdict...for the money I think there are many better choices."}
{"text":"Although our waitress Kristen was awesome, we had a very poor experience dining here this evening in celebration of my wife's birthday and Mothers day.  After ordering, we waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for our food.  Then they forgot to even prepare my wife's dish so she had to wait an additional 10-15 minutes for it to be prepared.  Upon confronting the Manager about this she proceeded to get argumentative, make excuses about how busy they were (as if they didn't know they would be) and actually blamed our waitress for the delay in  my wife's dish.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, event though they comped our meal to try and make it up to us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on 1/17 and we genuinely had a great time! Food was good and our bartender Kevin went above and beyond to meet our specific needs. My boyfriend tends to be a little particular in the way he likes to be served and Kevin was happy to accommodate each and every request. We will definitely be back because of Kevin!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but also expensive.  The menu feels like reading a book- I know options are great, but there are just way to many!  We ordered cheesecake once, but found it to be very sweet- this is probably just a person preference, but I don't like my cheesecake to be super sweet.  All in all an okay place to eat."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is delicious!!!! My fave the California Cheese Steak with fries! Portions are super large...good luck having room for their awesome desserts!"}
{"text":"It was ok but not great.  If felt like we paid way to much for what we got.  The cheesecake was great!  Our server was a dud,  no personality.  I felt like we inconvenienced him"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner. But it was very hard to read the menu. The lighting is very bad. Service was ok..... 
I'm not sure if I'd recommend this place to anyone. Especially if they have bad eyes! 
~Mamatpp"}
{"text":"I became very sick after eating at this location. My friend notified the manager that I was sick and throwing up in the parking lot. The managers response was\" let me know if she goes to the hospital so I can get corporate involved\". My food didnt taste good, it made me sick but the icing on the cake was the mangers response. I would have appreciated at the very least a drink of water. EXTREMELY  DISSATISFIEDD & Dissapointed in the entire experience."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for her birthday  because she had never been and she's a Big Bang fanatic, so she had to go \"visit\" Penny. When we arrived we only had to wait 10 mins, but once our name was called there was a sea of people that filled the front. So I'm guessing it's a great idea to call ahead. service was fast. Our server Daniel was very nice and poise, looked like he had been serving for years. We started with a CUP of soup, it looked like a regular soup bowl. By the time out entrees arrived, we could barely eat. good thing, because i was so0o disappointed in how my entree tasted. I order a Smokehouse Burger, and it was so0 dry and bland =[ I figured i was a bit out of it, and my taste buds just weren't awake after that AMAZING clam chowder, but no. I brought it all home to my Hubby, and he was confused on when he was going to get some flavor. I don't know if it was an off dish or what, but next time I'm ordering a steak or some pasta, and if they can't get one of those tasting great, then Cheescake Factory will only be for Soup & Cheescake for this family."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in was terrible.  From getting seated to our food.  All messed up, literally.  What's so hard to get simple things right! Yes, when I say everything, I mean everything.  Appetizers, main entre to our check.  Cannot think of a nice thing to say about this location.  If you want to walk out with a sour mouth of a bad experience this is your spot."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid no matter which city you are in. The menu is long, which is pretty amazing that they can offer as many different food options they do and they all taste good!"}
{"text":"This place is GORGEOUS! I have to say that the decor is like nothing I have ever seen in a restaurant. Very high ceilings and a gorgeous, well stocked bar. Waiters wear all white (shirt, pants, shoes and even the belt is white) and are very friendly/attentive. We had sun dried tomato pasta and a pizza. Finished it off with Red Velvet Cheesecake....big enough to share, and OMG delicious! My only \"gripe\" is that they serve free bread baskets and we never got one, forcing us to order an appetizer because my blood sugar was crashing and I needed food quickly. Fried zuchinni was to die for, and for only $5 it is a very cheap appetizer. Overall, very good and can't wait to go back!
PS, the menu is an actual book, so there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Food was great, quoted a half hour wait ended up being half that long.  Service left a bit to be desired sittingon the patio but at least they weren't over bearing."}
{"text":"Everytime i'm in Vegas I make a stop at the cheesecake factory in Caesars Palace. The selection is great, never dissapointed, never too long of a wait, and the staff is exceptional. Our last visit over the weekend we had the pleasure of being served by Gabriel. He was so delightful, fun, witty and charming. His service went above and beyond. Love this place:)"}
{"text":"Went for an early Valenyines date with the boyfriend
Fantastic service! Best service ive had in a long time at a restaurant!  Waitress was  promt when we needed somthing but left us go to enjoy our date otherwise!

 Food is always fantastic here. I got the Tostado chicken salad.. huge portions!!  Would highly recommend for a great date night!"}
{"text":"I know exactly what to expect from Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The food is always consistent, they have plenty of choices (maybe even too many), and the cheesecake is rich and delicious. I've been here a few times during off-peak hours and there is sometimes still a wait. The wait on weekends just isn't worth it. 

The food is rich. Everything is rich. Sauces, toppings, cheese... and if those weren't heavy enough, they bring warm endless baskets of bread with butter. Hmmm, can anyone really leave without dessert? OK, it's delicious. Yes, it's delicious. But, this isn't the place you want to eat three times a week, or you'll soon be buying a new wardrobe. (Check out their calorie counts for each menu item--some entrees have a whole day's worth of calories--and that's before you add on appetizers, bread, and, of course, the cheesecake!)

Enough of that...  The menu is about a half inch thick with lots of variety. It's a 'something-for-everyone' place that offers seafood, meat, poultry, and pasta. Most of the entrees are pasta-based meals in very generous portions. We usually leave with plenty of leftovers to make another meal. 

Every Cheesecake Factoy I've ever visited has the exact same menu, the exact same portions, and the exact same decor. Once inside, you can't tell if you're in a Cheesecake Factory in Florida, or a Cheesecake Factory in Pennsylvania, or a Cheesecake Factory in Moscow (if there are any in Moscow!) There is a reason they call this place a 'Factory.' It's like going into an expensive McDonald's--you know exactly what to expect, both good and bad.

The decor is 'Bellagio' meets 'Disney World.'  The interior of this place (like all other Cheesecake Factories) is someone's idea of ancient Rome (I think). It looks like the interior of most houses on that old TV show \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' proving that there is no correlation between wealth and good taste. 

As everyone else comments, the wait is long--sometimes painfully long--and the seating is often cramped. They don't accept reservations, and the range of the pagers is not too far from the front entrance. The hostess will give you a fairly accurate estimation of how long your wait will be, so you're probably safe taking a walk around the mall and returning reasonably often to ask, 'How much longer....?' That's IF you really want to eat here. When I do go here, I usually plan on a late lunch/early dinner (3PM) or visit on weekday evenings.

I have to admit, I started this review with 5 stars, and as I wrote all the negatives, I kept whittling away at stars, until I ended up giving them 2. If you're in the mood for heavy, rich, 'comfort' food, by all means splurge (both calories and $$$) and eat here. I usually go here when friends suggest it. There are other many other good restaurants within a mile or two."}
{"text":"Not your grandma's Cheesecake Factory we all got to know and love.  Those good old days are long gone, my friends.  You're better off turning around, heading back to the Food Court and buying yourself a Subway sandwich."}
{"text":"The avocado egg rolls were a surprisingly good. They're not cheap at nearly $10 for 6 halves, but I would actually consider ordering them again for sharing despite their price. Other portions were pretty generous but prices are a little high."}
{"text":"This review is for the pinacolada cheesecake only. I died and went to heaven. OMG."}
{"text":"Second time we had Cynthia as our server, she's very cheerful and knowledgeable about the menu. Which is useful as their menu is rather large.

The Restaurant was clean and really makes you forgot your in Las Vegas.

I also remembered on previous visits the granite floor tiles were super greases to the point I thought I was going slip. This time however it was not the case.

It would be nice for ya some plain ice tea, instead of that flower tasting kind."}
{"text":"Food is really good but also really heavy. There is no way you can look good in a tube dress after eating here. The portions are always generous (even on the kids menu) so come hungry. Everything is yummy! Pastas can't be beat"}
{"text":"I've been to the cheesecake factory in Seattle and Bellevue several times. I had been to this one for Sunday brunch before, and the food was good. However, this past experience was terrible. The wait was ridiculously unjustified for the quality of food we were served. The coke was without syrup twice in a row, basically watered down coke. I didn't complain the second time, the third time the coke was brought, the glass was so dirty I was disgusted to have drunk out of it. When the food finally arrived it tasted bland and almost as if it had been reheated. The angel hair was stuck together to the point where it needed to be cut into squares. I'm disappointed and don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"I love salad from this place taste fresh, crispy, just like a salad is supposed to. Our servers name was ebony she was wonderful.  Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"My wife likes to visit Cheesecake Factory when we are at South Park mall. The service is fast, and the menu is HUGE. The Cheesecake as everyone knows is delicious. I don't really like dessert, but I save room for cheesecake here."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory!

It was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory and I was SO looking forward to having a heavenly slice of cheesecake. 
Of course I was there for lunch so I had to order and actual meal before getting to dessert. The portions they give you here are MASSIVE! 
Food quality was great, it was yummy and price point was good too.

We had a hard time figuring out what we wanted as the menu features so many different options. 

I ordered a slice of cheesecake to go and ate it in my hotel room. nomnomnom."}
{"text":"After a long walking around.  Since we had a late breakfast, my daughter and I got a bit hungry while waiting for the rest of our family who went gambling at the casino.  After, looking around to get a bite, we decided to try this restaurant.  Since it's 3 pm...we decided to get a light lunch and try their so called cheesecake.   The kale salad was great and the crab cakes wasn't that bad...the cheesecake was so good. So overall, service was ok, food is good and cheesecake is definitely a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff, the food was exceptionally good and are priced reasonably; Other than that, I personally find the cheesecakes a bit \"too common\" and is overhyped and the wait time is too long"}
{"text":"This place can't seem to put it together. Despite many positive experiences around the country at other locations this one can't put it together. This was my 3rd try here. The first two ended up with conversations with the manager. This experience started with a long wait to be acknowledged, bread delivered with no plates or utensils, substitutions on entrees were noted but missed. No attention to detail at all but our waitress seemed to have loads of time to talk with coworkers at a nearby work station. Food was good as usual but I have now given up on this place. Too many good choices in Madison."}
{"text":"The 50 minute wait was more like 75 minutes. Party of 7 we were told they were waiting for another party to leave that had been there 90 minutes before they could seat us. The food was great. I asked the waitress to pack up my leftover shrimp scampi. 20 minutes later she came back to the table and when we asked where my food was she said she threw it out. She went to speak to the manager and came back and said they were making me a 1/2 portion to take. 20 min later she said they had a lot of tickets and it would be 15 min more. That she would let the manager know.  The manager came over and informed me that the first batch of my food was \"messed up,\" and they were making me another half portion. It would take 2 min. 15 min later my food came out. 
Thanks to the manager for not offering some kind of compensation for the $20 meal that was thrown out, and for the 55 minute wait to get a 1/2 portion to take home, and for not keeping me updated on how long this process would take."}
{"text":"Service was decent.
Food was meh,

You're pretty much paying for the atmosphere. 

Everything can and should be better but, its not. 
This is a rather pretentious place."}
{"text":"Long wait times the opening week are to be expected but waiting for over 1 1/2 hrs before getting our main course makes the experience even more tedious. It's a good thing we ordered appetizers as well-which did come in a reasonable time. The food is hit and miss. The baked Mac and cheese and the crab bites are awesome but the spicy chicken Chipotle pasta was hard to swallow. The pasta was undercooked and tastes like eating pasta drenched in BBQ sauce. The waitress/ ppl serving us were super friendly  and apologetic when they messed up a friend's cheese cake order but overall this restaurant is just meh at best. I've been to other cheese cake factories before so in comparison  there's definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"I am still waiting for my gift card with the refunded amount that I still haven't gotten by mail for over 2 weeks. I called the manager the next day and she assured me this would happen and it hasn't. Just more broken promises. I still have my receipt and if sending me a gift card was a lie then I want my money back! You saw the condition of my food. Enough said."}
{"text":"Service was good. Barbecue chicken salad perfect and red velvet cheesecake is a must,unbelievably great"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Prices are managable. Cheese cake is out of this world! Only have to take a star off because it gets loud in the restaurant and alcoholic drinks are too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"The wait wasnt that long despite the number of people actually waiting.  The food was good and could have probably done without the appetizer.  The reason  for the three stars is because the cheesecake tasted like something bought off the clearance bakery rack at walmart.  It didnt taste fresh at all and it seems they pride themselves more on the number of flavors of cheesecake rather than the quality of cheesecake."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  The service was GREAT!  Only negative I saw was the size of the menu.  There are to many choices.  No can ever say they couldn't find something to eat there."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Cheesecake Factorys over the years, all over the west.  This one... never again.

We went for lunch.  Terrible service and it's just way too expensive for what you get.  It took 3 tries to get me the lunch I ordered.  The first try was just wrong, the second try was closer but still wrong, finally the third try was right... she kept bringing someone else's burger.  And what a disappointment it was.  The burger could not have been more than a 1/3 lb with 2 pieces of thin bacon, cheese and 2 onion strings for $11.50.  It was a $7 or $8 burger at best.

After the DOUBLE mistake, the waitress was flustered and pathetic.  And of course, offered nothing for the trouble.  At the very least a manager could have stopped by to apologize.  

CF used to be know for their creativity, portion size, and great service.  Well things have definitely changed.  Now you get small to average sized portions and terrible service.  I guess that may be why you don't have to wait an hour for a table anymore.  Sad"}
{"text":"Cheesecake here is amazing! So many choices and experiences! Food is pretty lame. Some dishes are alright, but they are the ones that everyone does. Most of the food is oily or weird. It's always busy so you wait a long time for mediocre food. Remember to pick your cheesecake as you pock your food as they take the menu away."}
{"text":"I really do like this place. I don't know why I don't come more often. Today I tried Shepherds Pie. It was fantastic with chunks of ground beef plus mushrooms and peas and carrots in a gravy and topped with mashed potatoes . I also had a TJ lemonade which was like a hard lemonade. Pretty good too. Our server was Jalen and he was on top of things for our party of 10."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service from Brenda!! Dessert , atmosphere little busy but is ok, line at the door to be seat it is ok!! We have a good lunch!!"}
{"text":"Every Time I been here was great experience. I love the food  and also the server always so nice and amazing . Always checking on us if we okay if we want more drink .  Me and my friends never had this great service till we went here . I have recommended to every person I know and they absolutely love it here thy bring there dates here and also family. Thank you so much and keep it up ."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out; A portion of nachos, the seared tuna sashimi salad, and a slice of lemon and raspberry cheescake (after much deliberation).
Too many nachos for two people to get through, but the seared sashimi salad got eaten with ease. The cheesecake as expected was divine. Completely refreshed the palate."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I work in the forum shops so I have ate at this location for the past two years. I ordered a to go order, skinny steak medallions.... Come with potatoes, asparagus and cherry tomatoes. I've ordered this exact many times. So today when I picked up my food and got back to my store I opened and was disappointed in the portion, knowing it is off the \"skinnilicous\" menu so it is supposed to be smaller portion but this was beyond small.... 4 tiny pieces of steak and a scoop of mashed and maybe 3 small pieces of asparagus. I was bummed but what ever I didn't have time to get anything else, I was about to start eating when I noticed a piece of plastic in it, looked like a piece of tape, but at least a inch long   I called and asked to speak to a manager, she said to bring it back so they can see it and they'll start a new one right away and throw in a piece of cheesecake.  I get there the to go lady was nice, she says they are making a new one now.... I wait prob 10 mins get back to my store and open it. No tape but seriously gave me the same container of food back. So cool I got back a tiny portion of the food that had a piece of tape in it that someone stuck there fingers in to take out. Not cool."}
{"text":"Ok, First let me say I've never been a big fan of \"The Cheesecake Factory\" been a half a dozen times and the only reason was because my Girlfriend at the time liked it.
So yesterday when my friends said let go I wasn't to keen on the idea but I said fine I'll give them one more chance.This time I went for Happy Hour so I only ordered appetizers. Chicken Pot Stickers, Chicken Sliders and the Fried Calamari. So here's what I thought I wasn't Impressed Nor Disappointed. The Pot Stickers had good flavor but were a little salty the Fried Calamari was good could have been cooked a little longer and the Chicken Sliders were good not a lot of flavor thou. If you beem here before you know they have a Great Atmosphere and the Service was good as while.
Over all I might go back for Happy Hour but not in any rush. Hope This Helps"}
{"text":"Went here for a steak Diane and crusted salmon... serve brown rice or white if you don't like mash potato...good cake for dessert and to top it off great service from Jaime!!!good job Jaime!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love The Cheesecake?  You have 100 things to chose from. Portions are huge. I've never had a bad meal there. Tonight,  Parmasean herb crusted chicken. Was it good? Ate the whole thing!"}
{"text":"I work.around the corner from here so when I get off every so often I stop by for lunch. I just ate here again yesterday. I love all their food! Make sure to try the mahi mahi! Its the bomb!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places too take the kids when there home from college or during the holidays good food and great cheesecake though seems rather hard too navigate through sometimes.very professional waitress thanks again will be back .Dave s"}
{"text":"Don't go after dark if you have trouble reading in low light.  The place is as dim as a dive bar.  I asked to have the lights turned up & was told the lighting is corporate controlled.   She brought me two \"candles\" to read by. 

The food was good but more expensive than it was worth.  I went home & made a plate of food.  

I might go back some day, but only during the day."}
{"text":"Finally!!! I loooove this place excellent food as always but the service is really what makes it so wonderful!! Our server Kaytee was absolutely amazing! She was so fast and stayed on top of everything, she noticed we weren't happy with our appetizer and immediately took action even the manager came out to apologize! Kaytee was so sweet and on top of her game all the tables around us were in awe and bragging about her.... Literally! I have been searching for a great spot and lets face it...Vegas has alot of places with great food but it is beyond hard to find good, fast and friendly service BUUTTT I think I finally found it! Great job Cheesecake Factory! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly there was no wait and we got sat right away. The service was a little slow but it was also really busy. Our bread came out right before we got our food. I always get chicken farfalle because it's my favorite. Maybe it was because it was really busy but the sauce was super runny to the point it was almost soup. The noodles seemed a little hard as if they weren't cooked long enough. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best experience I've had at Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since my husband and I came here to eat. We were so glad we chose to come back because we loved it! We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese for an appetizer. The Louisiana chicken pasta for an entree. And our favorite part was the Cheesecake which we ordered the Kahlua and the oreo cheesecake to go. Everything was absolutely delicious! The portions are very large! We easily could have shared just the entree and been full, but at least we took so much of the food to go. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I just finished eating at The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is so extensive. I'm a vegetarian and I got the veggie burger minus cheese. It had really good flavor but it was falling apart as I was eating it. I had to use a fork to eat quite a bit of it. My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delicious!  Not too sweet. Next time I want to try one of the super antioxidant salads."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service. Bar. One of my favorite restaurants. I never had a bad meal. It gets crowded at the dinner hour."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF BOOGERS!  Just as we were taking our second bite of food we observed the bus person that was cleaning the booth behind us picking his nose right in the middle of the isle!  As if that wasn't bad enough he went over to the  utensil station and grabbed clean silverware and bread plates with his snotty hands and put the items on the cleaned off table. Next customer is getting an unpleasant surprise......We complained to the manager and walked out and will never return....if you can't teach your bus people some cleanliness, can you imagine what goes on in the kitchen!  I will never go back.  Could be why some of you other reviewers don't feel well after eating there.  They probably don't wash their hands after using the restroom either."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time on curbside to go unless you have an hour to spare. It is difficult to order as it appears only one person in the restaurant can take curbside delivery orders.  Then all food is not ready at appointed time and another 20 minutes later the wrong beverage is delivered and in 2 small containers as out of regular sized containers.  By now the food is cold.  
A manager is suppose to come over and yet no one is here. 
What has happened to Cheesecake Factory?  It use to be top notch."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here if you are gluten free.  I ordered a burger from the gluten free menu and they served it on a wheat bun."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  HOWEVER, we were celebrating my Mom's birthday and my husband ordered his favorite dish.  Chicken and Biscuits.  This is the only dish he has EVER ordered in Atlanta and here in Charlotte and obviously LOVES IT.  WELL!!!!  They changed the recipe and presentation of the meal.  Before it was served in a lovely deep bowl with delicious chicken, carrots, peas and yummy white sauce between the best biscuits ever.  What did they change it to?  The meal is put on an oblong plate, the chicken and other ingredients are swimming in the gravy which isn't appealing and the kicker, no more biscuits; They now serve muffins.  CHANGE THE MENU PEOPLE TO SAY  Chicken and Muffins.  Our very nice waiter informed us some genius in \"Corporate\", figures, made the change and they have had complaints.  Well here is mine.  Listen to your customers and your wait staff who inform you what customers like and don't.  Otherwise the meal overall was just ok."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and prepared super quickly. When some of our orders were accidentally dropped by a server the manager came over and paid for all the dishes dropped. 

It's family friendly and very clean. 

We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place.. I visited yesterday on a busy Sunday.. and even though we were a huge party  and it was slammed, they got us in quickly and in a friendly way.. The servers where awesome.. They took interest in our party.. The food was excellent and spot on.. I cannot say enough good things about this place.. Love it."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice but we ordered the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich. The sandwich was very tasteless and the chicken felt like it was boiled not grilled.. We ordered the strawberry cheesecake that was really good. The atmosphere is beautiful, I wouldn't recommend going there if you want food. I only like the cheesecake."}
{"text":"The food is alright, just typical chain restaurant food. I usually get the Louisiana chicken pasta which always has a lot of flavor. Sometimes it comes like it's been sitting out for a while because all the sauce has settled to the bottom and left a greasy film on top. My beef with this chain is their portion sizes. They're insane. Like, not even the hulk could finish a plate of pasta from here. I feel like they give you a huge plate of food just so they can justify charging $17 for bow tie pasta and paper thin pieces of fried chicken. CF is just a corporate restaurant at its finest. Nothing special."}
{"text":"This was great it's inside the Cesar's palace shopping area and is usually packed but they are very organized and were able accommodate gluten free requests!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time dinning at this location. Cheesecake Factory is obviously known for cheesecake, but also a variety of food and great service. I may be bias because I'm a local to Summerlin Las Vegas, but this location lacks \"great service\" the food is sub par, and food wait times are extremely long . Like I said I live in Summerlin and the Boca Park location has exceptional service, the food quality is much higher and the time it takes to receive your food is shorter. Each time dinning here it's been an extremely long time before our food came. If you're a local definitely avoid this location at all cost, I suppose it's convenient for tourist."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE the cheesecake factory. The menu is extensive something for everyone. The salads are incredible. Tell me that you don't love the bread, served warm and soft, and I'm not much of a bread eater but I must say I LOVE the bread at the Cheesecake factory. 

Audrey was an excellent server recommend the Cajun pasta which was excellent with a spicy kick. The
 barbeque chicken salad was incredible which Audrey also recommended. 

I hadn't visited the cheesecake factory in a year. I truly must say I missed one of my old favorite standby restaurants and will  definitely be back and highly  would recommend that you stop in and enjoy a great meal with someone or alone. 

Audrey, thank you for the incredible service . you rocked it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fantastic food. My husband and I ended up eating here twice due to how good everything was and for a reasonable price. I highly recommended it! Try the made to order guacamole. Yum!!! 
On a side note do NOT go to the Planet Hollywood restaurant in the same mall. It's aweful!!!"}
{"text":"This place was our late night go-to spot. When I say late night, I mean after 10. Usually good service and good food.  Last night the service was bad. The server was more focused on socializing with her coworkers than providing service.  Our food was cold, the bread was cold. The Sangria I ordered was so watered down it tasted like water with food coloring."}
{"text":"The perfect place to stop for a snack and a drink while shopping.  We always splitt some appetizers. The staff is friendly.  No complaints, for a chain restaurant.  It's a nice change from the super-inflated prices on the strip.
The mushroom flatbread is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Worst customer service of all time. Would not try. Waited 3 times on the phone to place takeout order for over 5-7 minutes each time asked to speak to a manager and they couldn't even find one to speak with for another 5 minutes. Poorly ran place. For basic food not worth the wait or pain in the butt to deal with that service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Their big menu has a lot of variety and it's truly a blessing if you're a vegetarian! Their avocado eggrolls are yummy and their eggplant parmesan is amazing!!!!! The eggplant is cooked perfectly and is crispy on the outside and tender in the center - not soggy. The pasta for the eggplant parm has pesto in it that is so delicious! Their cheesecake is my all-time favorite dessert ever. OK, some cons to be fair: this location is usually busy, tables are really really close together (feels like you're all in one party with your neighbors), and they do not clean the booth-style seating or their floors very well - you will find bread crumbs 9/10 times because they simply wipe the tables really quick in between patrons and a lot of the the bread crumbs seem to land on the floors/seats. Otherwise, great place to eat! I def. recommend!"}
{"text":"A little busy but at the end of the day, they have pretty good service. The have is a free cheesecake because of wait time. There lunch specials are delicious and the ceasar salad is amazing."}
{"text":"We normally love going to Cheesecake Factory, however this location was awful. It's in a really nice area so it's very surprising this location was so dirty. The floors were disgusting with food, menus and something slimy all over our section. The service was so slow and they weren't even busy we were there early evening. Two of the dishes we ordered came out cold and out third was fish and chips which was mushy. Such a disappointing experience. I normally don't do reviews but this was so many things wrong I hope that the manager reads this, because other locations are definitely above and beyond ."}
{"text":"Like many have said in previous reviews, it is a huge time commitment to dine in at the Cheesecake Factory and it's true, you might as well drive to Buffalo at this rate. 

From the time of getting a buzzer to paying the bill, my experience took roughly 2.75 hours on a weekday (lunch). My time doesn't include getting to eat my cheesecake. Wait times were estimated at 1.25 - 1.75 hours and then expect another hour waiting for your food to come out cold. In my case, we ordered chicken enchiladas and it was cold. 

On the upside, our waiter and her manager were very responsive and ended up remaking and waving the meal. However, we ended up just taking everything to go including the cheesecakes in frustration because it was taking too long. 

I guess the restaurant is still working out the kinks and you shouldn't expect everything to be perfect as the restaurant is still new. I suggest for prospective customers to wait a few more weeks or even months until they get their shit together and hopefully be on par with the US.

Take away for management:
1) Ensure food quality control
2) Improve turnaround time (I'm sure you guys are well aware)
3) Service = Excellent

If you're a person who gets hangry (hungry + angry), make sure you have a snack."}
{"text":"I moved from California to Cleveland recently to return to school, but when I saw Cheesecake, it just reminded me of home. Being inside (do all Cheesecake factories have the exact same layout?!) felt exactly like being back in SoCal so that was already an A+ in my book. 
The food was reliable as always and like always, their wide range of culinary selections can please all types of palates. Service is always great and obviously dessert is a must-have. Thank you Cheesecake for being so reliable and tasting and feeling like a big comfy fatty slice of home. 
Oh I got the special (chicken da vinci? or something like that) which was breaded chicken on pesto pasta with arugula and pancetta. It was comforting and delicious and a massive portion so I was happy. I also recommend the godiva chocolate cheesecake and I also love their shrimp scampi."}
{"text":"Great food but slow service.. As other Cheesecake Factory locations, this one was super busy too."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory Restaurant is a great place to have a quick meal as there is a large collection of meals to suit every customer's tastes. The restaurant claims it serves gluten and sugar free options. One can place an order and then walk around to do some excellent shopping. I had the privilege of sampling Mexican cuisine and did not regret the option. The orders are served unbelievably quickly while still very hot. The restaurant gives revelers sugar free cheesecakes with some strawberries. The floors are meticulously clean, an attestation to the efforts the management puts into cleanliness. The prices are incredibly decent for a restaurant of this quality and fame. Customers are assured of quick and friendly service from the ever-smiling members of staff. The restaurant serves amazingly huge parts and customers can request take out boxes if they feel like doing so. It is a very popular restaurant and so a visitor might have to wait a bit longer on set days. Nevertheless, no one wants to dine at an unpopular place"}
{"text":"Average to poor food. I've had orange chicken, a salad, and chicken enchiladas. They all sucked. They all cost more then they should have."}
{"text":"SO delicious. We've been to Cheesecake Factory many times before, the atmosphere and service is always consistent. The sweet brown bread and sourdough loaf are very good. I always order either the fried mac and cheese (yum!) or the buffalo blasts with bleu cheese (so much flavor! big enough to share)...as for dessert, the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake is delicious! A well deserved five stars for food, atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cajan style ribeye which is marinated for 36 hour and it was delicious. Good customer service and clean."}
{"text":"Every time when I am at South Park, I need to have a cake fix here with Pinot Grigio. I like Red Velvet cake. Its texture is oh so good!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the Cheesecake Factory! I went during their pre-opening and we ordered a bunch of things to try. 

1) Fried Calamari - this was good, I'm not a fan of seafood, but my friends loved it! 
2) Four cheese pasta - this was amazing!! The sauce was rich and creamy, but it wasn't overwhelmingly cheesy. I liked that the tomato sauce was sweet. Overall, this had great flavour. I would definitely recommend this, and I'd order it again. 
3) Louisiana chicken Cajun pasta - didn't try this myself, but my friend loved it! 
4) Shrimp platter - this was large enough to share with everyone as well! 
5) Tempura fish tacos - you get four tacos, and it's a great entree to share 
6) strawberry lemonade - this tasted soooo good and the glass was HUGE. FYI - it's on the sweet side 
7) Hershey cheesecake - this was AMAZING. If you love chocolate, get this! It's really rich and creamy, and you have to share it because it's huge. 
8) tuxedo cheesecake - this was really good too, and was lighter and tasted more like a mousse. 

Keep in mind: the portion sizes for everything are HUGE. You can share the mains with 2-3 people, or just take your leftovers home. So for the price, you're definitely getting your moneys worth. 

Overall: I'd recommend this place! There's so many options to try (over 250) and if you go with friends, you're all able to order whatever you like!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. I went here on a date and had awesome customer service. Very warm and welcoming. Place was very clean. And all the employees were dressed and groomed very well. Only gave it 4 stars because I asked for no mushrooms... pasta had mushrooms. Mushrooms are icky."}
{"text":"The other day, i took my holiday guests to share dinner at yourBiltmore location. My friends had arrived from Paris and were famished. I chose your establishment because of the extensive selection of menu items and the quality of food. It was approximately 5pm and we decided to enjoy our meal on the patio where it was relatively quiet. 

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I was concerned because I didn't see anyone else eating on the patio which typically means the server sometimes can forget they have people outside. Our table was clean, music was at an acceptable level, the sunscreens were pulled down and everything seemed perfect, then...our waitress arrived and introduced herself as Nikea. At that precise moment, our experience began to change. 

Granted, had been shopping all day. My guests were experiencing jet lag from their travels. Their English is not that great which required translation and patience just to get through the menu. The four of us were hungry, but we just couldn't believe nor did we ever expect what happened next. Nikea created an environment which made us feel as though we were being welcomed in her own home. Not once did we ever feel rushed nor did we feel like red headed step children for sitting on the patio. She had other tables on the inside  but somehow knew when we needed drinks or her assistance. She made reasonable suggestions and was present for our entire meal.  Although we had just met, she created an atmosphere in which I felt as though I had known her for quite some time. One might ask what exactly did she do?  Everything. Absolutely everything was perfect and exceeded my own expectations this making taking our dining experience from perfect to a remarkably extraordinary epic experience! If she isn't part of your training crew, I would highly recommend you consider making her one. Her mannerisms, attentiveness and overall professionalism was superb, but it was her personality which boosted her A game and placed a personal touch on our experience.

I truly hope you take the time to share this with her. Thank you Nikea for a remarkably relaxing and memorable dining experience. Entertains guests from foreign countries who have limited knowledge of the English language is very exhausting and sometimes stressful. Thank you for making this an amazing dinner for me and my guests. 

And if you are reading this to her, I hope you give her a great big hug for me right now. You absolutely put the \"awe\" in Awesome!"}
{"text":"Michael is serving us right now (10 pm 7/12/17) and he is so professional and charismatic! My family and I are locals and this is one of our favorite cheesecake places because of the great service employees provide! My mom forgot her reading glasses and he was so kind to offer his so she can read the menu. Haha thank you, Michael!!!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I ate at the cheescake factory maybe to long.
     We had the grilled artichoke this was very good , had a nice grilled flavor to it , unlike some places that say they grill ,but you cant' tell. We also had the stuffed mushrooms from the tapas menu. It was stuffed with fontina cheese and garlic, topped with parm cheese in a wine sauce.   
              For my main course I had the cobb salad it comes w/ a balsamic dressing but i chose to have it with ranch. This was the dinner portion it was huge. It was full of bacon , boiled eggs , chicken  ,blue cheese and topped with  a half an avocado. This was more like a chopped salad which  I prefer.. Everything was chopped into small pieces except
 the chix which was sliced, and it was full of chix. I joked to my wife that they put a whole chix in the salad , she had the same thing and hers was full of chix too.
             We also had the low carb cheesecake with a walnut crust , yummy.   Service was a little slow but i don't blame the server she ran her butt off , it seemed they were under staffed. It was very busy."}
{"text":"Great happy hour with a large selection and variety to choose from. Good drink specials too."}
{"text":"Took the family here tonight and had a very good dinner. Hibachi steak was cooked to a perfect medium and wife's salad was good quality with fresh greens.  Nothing over the top but always a good, consistent experience at ckf."}
{"text":"I am giving ZERO stars (but it forces me to give 1) because I ordered a chicken caesar salad and it was almost $18.00 and had a shit-ton of lettuce but barely any chicken.  This was a to go item so clearly why don't you mess with the girl that won't open it up until she get back to work.  Thanks for the 6 pieces of croutons that you dumped in there and the crusty old bread that you gave me with it....totally worth the $18.00.  I'm glad you put so much friggin lettuce in there.  This salad should cost a MAX of $8!!  Get that straight!i"}
{"text":"Though the prices are high and the menu is massive the food is well worth it. Our meals were delicious and the service was wonderful. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the most consistently good eateries in Summerlin.  There is never a wait, the help is super accommodating, and the food is just delicious.  The water is served with lemon and the two breads (wheat and sour dough) are perfect to get your empty stomach under control before the entrees arrive.  The outdoor tables are nice but I like to be seated in the rotunda."}
{"text":"I just finished dining there, and due to the long wait chose to sit at the bar. I just wanted to tell all that I thought the bartender was fantastic, I was there just to zone out, and not be bothered, and he did both. Very friendly, engaging with all the customers, but left me and kept making sure that my drinks were filled until I was ready to leave. Then once I was ready, checked me out got me on my way. Even took enough time to notice my name when I paid (with my credit card), and thanked me for coming in my name. Of course I didn't have catch his but great bartender!"}
{"text":"We ate here today for lunch.  Although the food and service is good, the cleanliness procedures are bad.  Flatware is placed directly on table top where people put there dirty elbows, purses, even sit there kids and dirty diapers.  Also, I wanted a refill of diet coke and the waitress asked a customer at a nearby table if he wanted tea refill.  She took both our glasses. When she returned,  my diet coke tasted like tea at the bottom!  She mixed my glass refill with a total stranger!"}
{"text":"Date: December 28, 2016
Time : Around 7:00-8:30 PM
Company: 4 adults, 1 child

I was excited to eat at Cheesecake Factory since most of my relatives were raving about the food quality and taste these guys offer. The waiting line was long since it's in an outlet mall so I already saw that coming. The receptionist informed me it would take around 40 minutes to get a table and we agreed. 

We sat by the long bench BESIDE the recepionists desk because we didn't want to miss our names. 30 something minutes passed and I asked for an update. They said we were to be called next, just waiting for the table to be emptied, so okay. So far so good. A few minutes after, they called in a party of 5, then a party of 3, and then another party of 6. I was confused because they said we were next. Approached the employee who was informing guests that there were available bar stools for anyone who wants them. Rudely answered and argued with my brother. He was in my brother's face already, so I talked to the receptionists behind the desk. I was so shocked when they said they called us TEN TIMES ALREADY, the other said FOUR TIMES. WOW, talk about inconsistency. Again, we were seated BESIDE THE RECEPTIONISTS DESK. No way we couldn't hear them IF EVER THEY CALLED US. Asked for a manager, but he was impolite and inattentive. Tried explaining our situation and get an apology from him but what he did was straight on unprofessional. He shoved the paper with my name on it to let me know that we were getting a table now. The worst manager ever, or so I thought....

After seating at our table, another manager approached us, hoping for a better response, we tried explaining what happened, never listened, kept cutting our sentences and even had the nerve to tell us not to argue with him. We were explaining, not arguing. Even told us he'd talk to the crew right away, followed him with my eyes, he didn't even say a word to them. So arrogant and ill-mannered. Walked away without even apologizing. 

They should thank the waitress they assigned to us. Made our experience a little tolerable. 

SO I WANNA SAY THANK YOU, CHEESECAKE FACTORY FOR MAKING MY FIRST DINING EXPERIENCE THE WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Would have given no stars if it was possible."}
{"text":"yes I'm one of those people that waited in line for hrs to get in and let me tell you it was worth it. Me any my friends throughly enjoyed ourselves. Most of the food was delicious, the portion sizes were huge, you honestly cant finish it.  the only thing is that there is a lot of that plastic American cheese on the menu which is no surprise because this is an American restaurant, so just try to stay away from those kraft single slices. some dishes were on the bland side I order a mushroom pasta and it tasted like boiled noodles with nothing on it, but they quickly replaced it at no charge for something else. The cheesecakes were amazing and took me 3 days to finish my slice at home. I had the key lime pie cheesecake which was simple looking but packed a punch. However it was very tart so if thats not your thing I recommend ordering a different one. Lastly I really appreciated that the waitresses were normal women properly dressed. It bothers me when you go to a restaurant and all the waitresses are size 2 wearing skin tight short black dresses."}
{"text":"I had the catfish breaded  to perfection seasoned not so much nice helping of mashed potatoes the green beans were fresh and snappy, sauteed with sweet carmelized onions excellent with a side of corn tartar sauce nothing special I was little disappointed that the catfish didn't come with more seasoned flavor. 

Topped it off with a slice of key lime cheesecake they were out of the Mango Key Lime so the classic Key lime was a good substitute and it was as I suspected creamy indulgence a little too much whipped cream."}
{"text":"We stopped by for few desserts, took chocolate fudge, lemon merangue cheesecake and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, all of them was amazing! Beyond description, plus service was professional and our waiter Daniel was a hilarious man. You know what, we're coming back tomorrow for dinner."}
{"text":"Everything about our visit to the Cheesecake Factory today was great. We had a very good waiter, Zach, who was always on the ball and very friendly. Management should give him a raise!

I ordered the Grilled Chicken Tostada salad. First of all, it looked beautiful. And it also tasted wonderful! One of the best salads I've had in a long time.

The atmosphere was great as well, except for the crazy kids that were sitting in the table behind us.

All in all, it was a wonderful Sunday afternoon at the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"ok. so let me start off by saying i love chessecake factory but this one here in lv was the worst experience me and my fiance experience. so we walk to the receptionist and gave her our name and wait time she said 15 min. thats perfect no problem. then within 3 min theirs another couple white couple extra friendly with eachother she gave them 5 min wait time like really are you serious . now in the next 3 min they were called in and i notice that so i got up as soon as that happend so i took it so offensive and more of a racist thing that happend . so im not white so i dont get better service wtf is that!!! i told her and she said oh i thought they were here b4 u no bitch u know damn well they wasnt stop that bull shit . so she said sorry let me take u in rn . racist . her name is jasmine african american!!!!"}
{"text":"Officially, Cheesecake Factory became the Cheezwhiz Factory with the ruination of the formerly perfect Factory Nacho recipe beginning today."}
{"text":"My daughter, son-in-law and I met a family member here today that we had not seen in over 30 years.  So obviously we were doing a lot of talking.  The waiter was very patience with us.  Took us forever to order because we were so excited by the reunion.  He did not let us feel like we were being a pain in the ass (which I am sure we were.)  

The Vietnamese spring rolls were very good.  The sauces it came with were awesome.  Our party had flatbread which was great.  Our relative had ahi tar tare which was fresh and flavorful. 

The waiter was very tolerant of the fact that we sat and talked long after our meal was over.  Granted we came in at 1 P.M. and they weren't that busy but if I was a waiter I would have been thinking \"jeez people, are you moving in?\"  I thought we would never get the bill and then discovered my son-in-law had paid during his trip to the rest room.  He's a good boy!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, only issue i experienced is little bit slow and getting the bill takes too long. Need to ask bill ahead not after finish dining"}
{"text":"We were waiting 15 min for someone serve us, and then 10 min for ordering food, the coming 20 min for food cooking and came out no napkin no silverware but a rush guy threw the dish on the table then left.  That's my first experience eat at CHEESECAKE FACTORY, but also last time too at least the last time!  Btw, the food is under cook!  Good luck!  Guys."}
{"text":"Always a crowd pleaser..... Who does not like cheesecake???  Big menu has plenty of choices for everyone.... Service is consistently very good too!  It's a big hit for the very young and seniors because of the various portion sizes and styles of food...."}
{"text":"Normally when I go to cheesecake the service is slow, there's a long wait to get seated and the food is okay. Nothing that amazes me. I asked how long it would be to seat 4 people and they seated us right away. Our waitress Joey was attentive and didn't mess up our order which is something I have a problem with when it comes to other cheesecake locations. The food was better than other times. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best chicken Pam around! Oh, and always get cheesecake. Not doing so should be a crime."}
{"text":"The wait is always ridiculous (have more seating in the lobby for those who are older), but every time my family receives  incredible service. I brought my mother in for her birthday, & our server was nothing short of professional and kind. Exactly how a waitress should take care of a table. I'm impressed, & I wish I could remember her name to request her every time we come."}
{"text":"Cheesecake and comfort food.  Service is a bit slow especially upstairs so avoid if possible.  Server was never around to ask for refills or other items needed.  Tip reflected the service."}
{"text":"THE worst manger I have ever dealt with EVER. I had a party of 8, 2 were in the bathroom and they refused to seat us until 90% of our party was here. They finally seat us after 15 minutes (as we are still waiting for the 2 in our party). They give us 2 booths back to back. We wanted a table together. We saw 2 tables so we asked our waitress if we could connect the tables and sit together so she went to go ask. In the meantime we start setting up the tables. The manager (Amid which refused to give us his full name) walks up to all EIGHT of us (this is the first time I've seen this man) with an attitude and starts saying very rudely get up, no this is not what we agreed on either move tables or don't dine with us and get out. My sister calmly says we did not agree on anything and I have never seen you before. I dealt with the hostess. He says no no no and does not let my sister finish her statement as were walking away my brother asks what is your name I'm leaving a review he says Amid we then ask what is your last name he then proceeded to say I will not tell you we go back and forth for five minutes then says get out or I'll call security.
Now to me this is no way to manage a restaurant I felt disrespected. 
I would definitely not recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Now I know why they call it \"the Cheesecake Factory\" BEST cheesecake I ever had.  I ordered the sea salt and Carmel. The menu was literally 35 pages long, so it takes awhile to decide.  I went on a busy weekend night but my husband went up to the bar and ordered us Mai Tais and they were really good, we sat outside on a beautiful night with our mai Tais and people watched, the time went by quickly.  I ordered some spicy shrimp dish that was delicious, the bread was good and they had something for everyone. I will return.  Good service and not overly priced."}
{"text":"Great and fast service. My wife and I each got the fish taco, one got grilled and one got fried. Both were amazing! Each had their own taste, did not expect this. Grilled was slightly spicer. The beans were amazing and I hate beans! Rice was just cooked I personal would have liked it a little softer. If you like raspberry lemonade it is always a must at Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, had the Cajun pasta and if was the perfect meal with a little heat! Great service and friendly people! Wish I had room for their amazing cheesecake but the meal was to large to save room for desert!"}
{"text":"Only positive that I had from my experience was the food was ok, and neatness of the restaurant, but their customer service is horrible.  The way they handle parties of 6 or more is ridiculous.  I tried to make a reservation for 20 people, could not do it because they do not take reservations.  I get there earlier to get a table and wait for my friends to arrive.  They said they will have one ready for all of us, but could not let us seat at the tables until at least half showed up.
So there they kept us for about 45min until we were a total of 10.  
To me that is total bullshit, is in the middle of the week, not too busy, just a fiasco from that point forward.  If you are planning to have a big dinner, birthday dinner, or anything involving parties of more than 6 people choose a different restaurant.
TOTAL BULLSHIT."}
{"text":"Wow what a great restaurant.
The gucamole here is absolubly crazy!!! If you love avocado, plates that have it are a must try.
................................................................................................"}
{"text":"first of all they took so long to bring the food out waiter brought my food out cold  and for got about us the whole time  i been here before and the food was great  but  now  seem like it been going down hill  not worth  the money i could of when some where better the money i spent here never again"}
{"text":"Asked for stuffed chicken tortillas done crispy the server asks well done and I said yes the girl who brought it out said the plate was hot but they were like room temperature and soggy as could be so I got up and left like a gangsta cause I saw waiting and I'm not gonna take a chance on getting it redone."}
{"text":"I took my friend  here for the first time. We both had the Cobb Salad and it was so good we also had cheesecake for dessert, we both had the sugar free to take home. My friend wants to go back again."}
{"text":"My first time here. Its was awesome. The waiter was excellent, very attentive. The food was very good. I would recommend and will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Long wait time. Food just ok. Customer service is lacking. Cheesecake is delicious   Its worth the trip to the forum shops @ Caesar's where you get in & out in less time including travel time. IMO."}
{"text":"I had the eggplant parmesan. It was terrible. Way too much garlic. The pasta that came with it was also disappointing. Very plain with a few herbs sprinkled in. My companion got the fish tacos. They were good. But the thing that I really hated was the way the seats were. We were a foot away from the next table and couldn't help but hear everything they were taking about. That seating arrangement was very popular at the trendy restaurants in the 1980's. I hated it then and I'm over it now.  We were planning on getting dessert, but couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"I love the fried mac and cheese, and the mac and cheeseburger!  Booth 94 in the rotunda room has a beautiful view of the city. Its the only inside table with a view. The outside is pretty the lights twinkle like stars lok. The cheesecake while good is frozen and if you buy the cheesecake factory brand frozen ones at Walmart its the exact same cakes they serve in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a party of 23. They do not take reservations. When our group checked in we were told it would be about an hour before our table was ready. We ended up waiting 2 hours for our party to be seated and we had to split our party up in 2 groups and sat on opposite sides of the room. We got 2 complimentary orders of nachos for waiting so long. Service was horrible. They insisted on taking our order a certain way but when the food was delivered, they had no clue who ordered what food. There were 2 servers for our group. One server was scheduled to go home and rushed some of us to pay our bill. They didn't check on how our food was and at the end brought us the bill without even asking if we'd like to order dessert.  I will not be going back to this location again!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  If there's a special occasion and I can pick the place, this is it!!!!!  I love the cheesy buffalo chicken tenders appetizer and the asian chicken wraps!!!  The portions are huge and priced right."}
{"text":"We like coming to this restaurant because it has great food and great service. We like the calamari. We also liked their cheesecake."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Food is delicious (in photos: seared ahi tuna, green salad, hibachi steak, peach smoothie, warm honey oat/wheat bread, and mango key lime cheesecake)
- Ingredients are fresh and good quality
- Price is only slightly higher than the pickle barrel next door, but the quality is better
- Large selection of items
- Accurate lineup estimate and logistics for so many people

Cons:
- Long wait. At around 5pm, 1 hour lineup to get a buzzer and then another hour to get a table
- Customers must lineup in the middle of the mall corridor
- Confused servers repeatedly get items wrong or do not check on the table. If they did not make so many mistakes I would have been able to finish my dinner at least 45 min earlier
- Some portions are very small for the price and some are large (inconsistent)
-  Takeout requires a wait time of 40 minutes
- Cannot handle large parties or groups. Most of the tables are small. Good for couples."}
{"text":"A very big Thank You to the manager, Frankie and our server Josh! As busy as it was tonight, the service and food was excellent.  My son is getting ready to deploy and our goodbye dinner was generously complimented with a dessert for him in gratitude for his service. Well done!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Are original waiter had to go because he had his lunch break. So another waiter came along, then a few minutes later that waiter leaves and a new one comes. We wanted to order desert but we never saw are waiter. So then we finally ordered are desert, (cheese cake) we finished and we asked for the check. The waiter TOOK FOREVER to take the check back and give us our change. But at the end the food was delicious and sometimes your don't get the right servers :/"}
{"text":"We like the CF ambience and taste of the food, but it is often very starchy, high in fat, and salty.  It's convenient when you are out shopping and get hungry!"}
{"text":"Came here last night to celebrate a loved ones birthday, we had a party of 7 adults 1 child. The lobby was very packed with guests waiting to be seated so we knew it would be a bit of a wait but we ended up waiting to be seated for over an hour and a half. We saw families that arrived after us dine and leave even before we were seated. Food and service from waitress was good, once we were done with our meals we asked to speak to a manager. Matt came over to talk to us and as we expressed how upset we were over the waiting time he, instead of being apologetic, was very argumentative and defensive saying how that is \"normal\" for large parties. All we were hoping for was for a sincere apology since the hostess manager Brad failed to do so and to top it off didn't even seem to care that we were standing there waiting that whole time. As we were leaving three hours after arriving Brad walked past us and all he did was look at us and looked at his watch, that could of been his second opportunity to apologize for the wait time but he didn't. If you plan to come here with a large party please take your business elsewhere or be prepared to wait a long time without even being acknowledged that you're there. Will not be coming to this cheesecake factory again."}
{"text":"Amazing menu... Chopped salad is amazing. Great service!"}
{"text":"I love the lettuce wraps.  Garlic Bread  Was One Of The Best I Have Had.  Our server was great, not sure her name.  In fact I think there were two helping us. Jason and I enjoyed the chocolate peanut butter cheese cake after. With A Late.  We where going to go for drinks at a local bar, but decided to stay and sit at the bar.  So pleased we did.  Go just for the bar experience."}
{"text":"The National Cheesecake Day deal was just too good to miss. I, being the sugar-addicted dessert aficionado that I am, had to visit not just once, but twice. If I lived closer I probably would have gone for all four meals during the two-day promotion.

Overall, the service was timely, professional, and attentive. The decor, atmosphere, and layout are that of a typical Cheesecake Factory: could be great for a date, but no one cares if you show up in a t-shirt and jeans. The quality of the food is great, but the prices are a little high for it to be more than the occasional treat (especially for a college student). The menu is very large, which can be a little overwhelming.

I stopped by on Friday afternoon around 2:30 pm with a friend. We were seated at a table outside within a few minutes. The complimentary bread was yummy; I prefer the honey wheat brown bread to the sourdough because it is softer. I ordered the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread, and my friend got the avocado, zucchini, and portabella fries, which were served with two dips. These were considered \"small plates and snacks\" on the menu and cost $6.50 each. Without cheesecake, the portion sizes would not have filled me up. (But I guess that's the point, I've never gone to the Cheesecake Factory and not gotten cheesecake). I enjoyed my flatbread--it had a great, crunchy crust. The amount of toppings was perfect, although the flavor profile isn't one that I particularly cared for (just my tastebuds, though). My friend enjoyed her \"fries\" as well, especially the zucchini ones. 

Then, of course, we ordered cheesecake. We split the new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch and Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. The Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch had a great, strong hazelnut flavor; however, I found myself missing the bitterness of the chocolate to balance out the sweetness. Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple was even sweeter, being loaded with candy bars and caramel. The plain cheesecake at the edge that didn't get the caramel swirl or candy bits was a relief.

I returned again on Saturday around 1 pm by myself. This time, I ordered the Tomato Mozzarella Toast, which was much more in line with my tastes. The crunchy bread was perfect, the tomatoes were sweet and juicy, and the pesto burst with flavor. Really delicious, if a little overpriced at $8.50.

After my sweetness overload from the previous day, I decided to go with the Tiramisu Cheesecake. The coffee provided the bitterness I was looking for; this one was not too sweet for my tastes. However, the cheesecake itself could have been richer.

So, bottom line: pretty good. If I'm going to be picky, food is pricey. Cheesecake flavors are cool, but I prefer richer cheesecakes that are more tangy than sweet. But they're good to satisfy my need for sugar. If it wasn't for the promotion, I wouldn't have visited, and I doubt I will soon if not for a special occasion."}
{"text":"No complaints about the food, it was tasty and plentiful.  However, we had two major complaints about the service:

1) We specifically asked the hostess for the quietest possible table. She said \"sure\", and then proceeded to seat us right next to the server's station, where they were constantly banging and crashing plates and silverware around. Numerous times I had to plug my ear with a finger to block out the noise.  This in itself pretty much ruined the meal.  

2) The server was waaaay too \"attentive\". He was artificially perky and chatty and was constantly interrupting us with \"how are things\" and \"don't forget to leave room for dessert\", etc etc.   We had been trying to have a serious conversation over lunch but actually gave up on that due to the waiters constant (and unnecessary) interruptions. 

Between the deafening noise and the pushy server, we had a rather negative experience.

Update Feb 21st:  I sent CF a link to this review. The manager of the location sent us a $15 gift card and an apology for our experience. We went back and had a nice dining experience. Food was great, waiter was not pushy at all. Thanks, Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Good service. We ordered a chopped salad, pizza and jambalaya. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I went for just dessert and we were greeted promptly and waited on in under five minutes the food was perfect I will be back again and again and the parking garage was free up to 3 hours. That also made the experience more pleasant."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here was over 10 years ago. I actually remember how bad it was then so we have avoided them since. We were recently given a gift card for $25, so we decided to give them another try. After all, it would be free. Ordered calamari as an appetizer and the Fish and Chips for an entrée. The Calamari came in 2 temperatures; very cool and medium hot. It was obvious that we were offered some that had sat a while and some that was made closer to the time we ordered it. The entrée was hot, oily and almost neutral in taste. I ate one piece and called it quits. Our meal and 2 waters ended up $40.00!!! As a retired international airline pilot, I have eaten all over the world and would put this in the bottom 5% of all restaurants I have ever eaten at. The only positive I can say is that they are consistent; bad 10 years ago and just as bad now."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, because ordinarily, going to the Cheesecake Factory is such a treat! (We don't have one in Greensboro, NC). Sure, it's not \"fine dining\", but the food is always good and the portions are so large! With that said, my sister threw me a baby shower at this location on 2/13/16. They don't take reservations per se, but my sister was assured, 3 weeks ahead of time, that they would hold the back room open for our party of 25. My sister called the morning of the shower to make sure everything was still a go. This was around 10:45 am and she was notified that there was already a line of patrons outside the door. We hurried to the restaurant and arrived around 11:30 am and were told that the room and tables we were promised had already been taken!!

We decided to stay and wait, as invitations had been mailed out, and it was too late to change locations. Suffice it to say, we did not get seated until after 1 pm. This was difficult for me because I am 9 months pregnant and hadn't eaten because I never anticipated the wait. 

I ordered my favorite, Chicken Madeira, which was good as always, but the occasion was really ruined by the long wait."}
{"text":"We are sitting at this restaurant serves salty pasta and now have waited 30 more minutes and the food is not out.  Will not be back here for my bday. After an hour we get word something is wrong with the pasta. Needless to say we have left and we wont be back after others had complained before us. They should have figured out what was going on earlier.  You guys need a better management staff that listens to the customers."}
{"text":"The 3 different appetizers we got were VERY good. Tater Tots Fried Mac & Cheese Avocado Egg-rolls, the sauce for the egg rolls was  delicious. Of course the bread  was good, my favorite was the honey wheat. The hostess were very nice and friendly. Our waiter was ok. However both dinner plates we got were  Eggplant Parmigiana with Pesto pasta & the Shrimp /Sausage rigatoni pasta. We didn't have any dessert. If I would have liked either one of our dinner plates I'd give it better star rating. Oh we sat outside and enjoyed the view of the large fish tank. Best seat in the house"}
{"text":"Solid quality food and good value--very friendly service.  A great option for a reasonably priced meal that will be good."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of going to dinner there based on how busy they are. I do though love calling for curbside pickup. On nights that's its snowing and cold out its fun to just pull up and not have to get out if your car."}
{"text":"This was definitely a \"Meh. I've had batter\" My girlfriend and I love cheesecake factory and have been to many different locations. 

While at the one in SF we had the best dinner. I ate the spicy crispy beef, which by the way i highly highly recommend. 

I intended on enjoying a similar experience here, however left dissatisfied. 

We were sat right next to the entrance to the kitchen, which usually doesn't bother us, but just added to the roughness of the experience. The server was rude, prompt, and showed more of a desire to go home, than to do her job. 

Long story short. it was a sub par cheesecake experience."}
{"text":"Say what you want... Yes it is a chain restaurant. But everything I have had here has been perfectly cooked. When you come here you know they will not miss the mark. I think the service has been a bit hit or miss. It has been both excellent and atrocious."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Cheesecake Factory especially the happy hour.  My favorite place to celebrate my birthday every year.  Something for everyone.  Love the Godiva Gluten-Free Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"We met a few friends in Vegas, and thought it would be nice to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  We hoped that it would be consistent with the quality we have come to enjoy like the one in Waikiki on Oahu.

We were not disappointed.  We started with a few appetizers, the crab artichoke dip is the best!  My wife had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (with a Thai Curry flair) and I had the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo.  Both were outstanding, and highly recommended!

The hostess was very courteous, and our waitress was extremely attentive.  The only disappointment was not having time to stay for dessert!  We had to leave en route to a 7 p.m. show of the Jersey Boys playing at the Paris Hotel!  That was also a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you want to eat something that just melts of flavor when your taste buds devour the goodness you have bestowed upon them. Come to the Cheesecake Factory and you will find just that! I believe their food is phenomenal and I know most people who have visited here will agree. On top of that they have their own unique deserts. They have a type of Cheesecake that will fit everyone's specific taste!!!"}
{"text":"Tastes like dog food. All of it. 


Like oh my god. 
Worse than apple bees. 
I wouldn't even give a homeless person this as a meal...... They probably wouldn't even eat it.


Bad service, took forever. I wasted so much gas waiting in the takeout parking spot.

The shrimp roll.... Had ONE HALF of a shrimp in each roll..... I guess that's the portion for real...
The sauces that come with it are garbage, inedible. 
The noodles in it are gross. Overall a bad choice.

So disappointing. 

Crab artichoke dip tastes like canned TUNA and rotten. I felt like throwing up after I ate it. Plus they gave me four tiny slices of bread for a huge portion of fishy nasty dip. Just pretend you mixed cream cheese with cat food and warmed it up... There you go.

Edemame, freaking soggy and salty...

Potstickers..... Tasted like canned chicken... Sauce was super strong and nasty. Looked frozen and microwaved.

$55 FOR THIS 

FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS..............:::::


FIFTY.       FIVE.    DOLLLARS.        WHAT THE HELL.

I am without words. 
I have been to a cheese cake factory before in CA. It was edible atleast...

This one was a JOKE. 


One word. 

DISGUSTING. 


We're still hungry and threw it all out. Had to go get a burger some where else. The stand $6 for a burger... What a relief.

$6 

SIX DOLLARS 

SIX.   DOLLARS.  


Cheese cake factory.... How are you in business ??? And how do you live with yourself feeding people all of this nasty food... I wonder how many people have been sick and disappointed from eating here...

Stay away. Go to the stand or honestly Taco Bell, McDonalds... Anywhere else... Yuck id rather eat pink slime from McDonald's than cheese cake factory ever again...

I am in complete shock that this nasty food is being served and people come here... 

If I wanted to eat rotten tuna artichoke dip I could have made that myself and it probably would have tasted better than cheese cake factory..

You call yourself chefs... 
Hahah. 


Awful."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is home to my favorite dish of all time, the crispy chicken costoletta.  It is so good I can't even put it in words and for that alone it gets the 5 star rating.

The service has never been terrible and the drinks are pretty good too.  

Can't wait to see you again, Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Great menu. Very diverse with lots of options. Service is above average. I eat here every day for lunch! We always leave happy."}
{"text":"It deserves four stars,service is good ,food are awesome especially when you end it by a wonderful cheese cake , this is special , I never taste a great cheesecake like in this place , highly recommended."}
{"text":"I maintain that The Cheesecake Factory's menu is too large for its own good, but the service was great and the restaurant, as always, was comforting. The veggie burger (made with grains and...beets) was a bit above average--definitely better than I'd expected from a chain.  The Evelyn's pasta, though, was undercooked and mixed with charrred eggplant."}
{"text":"I love this place !! Great service and outstanding food. I would like to eat here again and again... Lol"}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times, the one in Scottsdale a few, and being from Chicago area Woodfield and Hancock Center.  The food is always good, HOWEVER, this time one thing wrong after another.  We got there 12:30 to meet a friend for lunch. Being this time of year in the desert it was quite empty. We were seated in a booth by the bar and the bartender took our drink order.  That came correct and timely. After giving our order we were offered bread and we accepted. Bread never came so we asked numerous times and finally told in oven. Nobody in the place! It finally came, not sliced or no cutting board. Our order came, but the large Cobb salad came 10 min. ahead of our ReneSpecial. Our friend sat while we waited for our meal. It came..wrong salad with wrong sandwich. Easy enough we switched, but was told they were out of soup bowls! Our complete meal was eaten and still no soup and we asked numerous times from whomever passed by. Bartender guy never apologized. Finally manager came with the soup in large bowls. Never offered a slice of pie or anything. Would have declined, but would have been a nice gesture. I could kick myself for giving a $8 tip on the $45 bill....2 cents would have been sufficient. Then just grabbed our bill and no thank you for the tip, but that seems to be a universal thing. Very rarely do we get a thanks on sometimes a 20% tip."}
{"text":"THE NAME SAYS IT ALL~!! I love, love, did I mention LOVE cheesecake!!  Oh, and don't they got a large selection of them.  Yes, it's over ten dollars for one slice.  Still that slice is so decadent and rich!! It's worth every penny!!

Then onto the food, I think the menu is a BOOK!  Their main characters in this novel of a menu is GREAT FOOD.  I got me the twisted salted pretzel spiked milkshake, drizzled with caramel.  These meals are not everyday meals, but special occasions.  This place is well worth the money!!  Then I got chicken taco's, and the hubby got some yummy mexican dish with those delectable black beans.  

Other times I've tried the portabella sandwich, that proved to be so tasty that I think I got it twice from there.  Cheesecake factory isn't just a restaurant, it's a experience.  There ambiance is superb, relaxing and just beautiful architecture.  This place has a upscale feel, in a laid back vibe.  I just LOVE IT~!!  Since this place is popular, and we have only a few scattered over Pittsburgh, there may be a wait time.  Especially on weekends.  Trust me, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Since we came here on a Wednesday, it wasn't crowded at all. I haven't been to Cheesecake factory for a while, so I don't remember their big menu and huge portions though I know I always have leftovers to take home.

It took us some time to go through the menu and decided what to order. My friend had Bistro Shrimp Pasta and I got the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad. We were shocked when we got the food. It was a lot. We both like our dishes. It was good to eat a big salad.

As for cheesecake, we had Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. It wasn't bad, but a little bit too sweet for me. Not much cheesecake in it either."}
{"text":"I called to place an order to-go. The lady who answered placed me on hold and transferred me to bakery. I'm not sure why but maybe that's how they place their phone orders? I was on hold for nearly 15 minutes and when someone finally answered, I began to place my order. However, this other lady tells me I can't place an order to-go because the mall is shutting down for the night. Ok but your business is posted to be open until 11pm and you have your own entrance/exit to your restaurant outside the mall. What does the mall have to do with whether I can place an order over the phone? I'm not from the area but when I'm near a Cheesecake Factory location, I like to treat myself. I have eaten at this CF location before and I've never had an issue but this changes things. I do not appreciate having not been informed immediately that I would not be able to place an order (because the mall is shutting down for the evening) and I do not appreciate being placed on hold for nearly 15 minutes only to be left disappointed. I was so looking forward to the cheesecake too!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today and was completely disappointed.  I ordered Renee's lunch special.  It included soup, sandwich, and salad.  The soup was tortilla.   It was like some kind of much.  It was barely warm. The taste was awful.  The chicken salad  sandwich had almonds and way too much mayonnaise.    Besides that buttered bread was on the sandwich.  Nothing in the description said the toast would be buttered.  The salad was saturated with the dressing.  Even the unsweetened tea tasted old. My waiter was Mr. positive but didn't wait on me or ask me if everything  was OK.  He was concerned that my tooth picks that held the sandwich together was taken apart.  I told him that I didn't like butter all over my bread.  He said, \"OK, just wanted to be sure that they didn't leave it that way.\"   I would expect that he should have asked me if I wanted bread without the butter but he didn't and got away so fast that I couldn't ask him.  He never came back to ask me if I needed tea or anything. The soup was so bad I didn't eat it at all.  I ate the salad or there would be no lunch. When he picked  up my plate, he said, I guess this means that you have no room for cheesecake.  I guess he said that because most of the food was still on my plate. Once again he sped off not given me a chance to tell him that the soup was awful.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This may be the non-fast-food chain restaurant I have been to the most across the country and in Las Vegas in the last few years...and this location is by far my favorite. Just off the freeway in the Green Valley area of Las Vegas, lots to do in the area before or after eating, and no crazy tourists (like the one in Forum Shops) or  nouveau riche with entitlement issues (like the Summerlin location). Do I exaggerate? Yes. Is it completely untrue? No. Admit it, you've seen it on occasion if you've been to either of those other LV locations.

Why return so often to this CF? Awesome food and service and rarely an unruly customer. We've visited for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner over the years and I think maybe twice there was a problem with the food, which was rectified quickly. We've been there as a party of two, with out of town friends, with a group, and each time have gone away happy. 

So, consistency in quality (food and service) is one point in their favor. Another is the wide variety of menu items. Sure, there are several pages of variations on chicken, but there are also so many different meat preparations, salads, sandwiches, Asian offerings and tasty appetizers to fit the bill. A bread basket to start, and two pages of cheesecake variations to finish (key lime is #1!)...mmmm...

I am a coffee snob, not so much (though a little) a chain snob, but even this is hard to find fault with at CF. Yes, it's a chain, but there are unique menu items (see other reviews, which I agree with) that other places don't have and can't reproduce in such surroundings. All that makes it kind of \"unique\" among chains and I've squared the circle as best I can here. 

The reason for four rather than five stars is my own little entitled whine...bring back the Turkey Reuben, I say! Every time I ordered it, the waiter/waitress said \"great choice,\" so why did it vanish from the menu in 2009?"}
{"text":"If I can rate this place a zero I would.  The hostess is very rude and very unaccommodating.  I've been through so many Cheesecake Factory and it's one of my favorite restaurant but with my experience on this Branch zero star for you guys!"}
{"text":"This place is always a treat. The menu is huge, with a variety of different cuisines. Some of my favorites are the spicy cashew chicken, and hibachi steak. The are both so delicious. Be prepared for a 1-2 hour wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"I guess The Cheesecake Factory doesn't really require a review but here's my two cents. I was a bit irate when they axed my favorite dish, the crispy spicy beef. Fortunately it was quickly replaced by my new favorite, the gumbo. I'm not really sure how a kitchen can specialize in every cuisine known to man but they manage to pull it off somehow. If i have one complaint, it's the excessive use of butter, which I can taste on my lips after every bite of almost every item on the menu. Then again, butter makes it better right?"}
{"text":"We went to the North Scottsdale location for my daughter's 18th birthday last night (5/11/2017).  We called to make a reservation for 15 people for 6:30pm when they opened at 11:00am, and were told they don't take reservations until 2:00pm.  I called back at 2:00pm and was told they only take reservations until 5:00pm.  I explained that we had 15 people coming for an 18th birthday dinner, so if they wouldn't take a reservation we may need to look elsewhere.  I was told that Thursday nights aren't busy, and if we showed up before 7:00pm we wouldn't have to wait more than a few minutes.  My daughter really wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory, otherwise I would have gone to a place that takes reservations.  

Our large party showed up at about 6:20, and we were of course told it would be a while.  A party of 17 had just showed up right before we got there.  We had to wait in the crowded waiting area for an hour to be seated, and when we did it was very cramped.  Our servers did a great job considering there were so many of us, and the food was pretty good, but I think it's ridiculous to only take reservations during lunch/early happy hour time."}
{"text":"Okay okay, here's the deal. I remember eating here, but I don't remember what anything tasted like. That's how irrelevant the food here is. I would rather face all of my insecurities than eat at this cheesecake factory EVER AGAIN. The Cheesecake Factory aesthetic is comfortable and fun, unlike Pancy, our waitress. She was no fun and did not get us extra brown bread when we asked for it. Maybe she was having a bad day, but SO WAS I! Anyways, definitely not worth the prices, but if you want to look cool on a date or business meeting. . .you should go here.  I had a subpar experience at The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! Always impeccable service, consistently good food and great atmosphere for lunch or dinner. Favorite appetizer: Ahi Carpaccio. The kale and salmon salad is always a winner and the veggie melt is one of the best vegetarian dishes I've had a chain restaurant. Of course the cheesecake is amazing. Lemon raspberry will give you just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth while still feeling light and fresh."}
{"text":"Despite reading some of the negative reviews we decided to give the Cheesecake Factory a try and we weren't disappointed.  We were seated immediately and drinks were served promptly. Our food was served hot and the best part was our waitress Karen was so attentive. She even brought complimentary soup since they ran out of turkey for my turkey burger. I didn't mind since they have so many wonderful choices. Yes, I will definitely return next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Gone downhill, The floors and tables are always greasy, and my salad had a distinctly grey tone."}
{"text":"For my mom's birthday, we sat outside. We ordered meatloaf, some salads and pasta. Everything was very good. The service was slow even though they were not busy. After we we done eating, we ordered a cheesecake. The cheesecake was delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went out for dinner there yesterday night while enjoying a nice night out together, and after our terrible experience with the place we had chosen for lunch, The Cheesecake Factory was a relief. Our service was exceptional, Laura waited on us and she couldn't have done a better job. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and let us take our time and choose what we wanted. Everything was absolutely delicious from the Georgia Peach I ordered from the bar menu to the S'mores Cheesecake I had for dessert. Keep it up CCF always a good choice and we will definitely be back!

Yummy - Orange chicken leftovers!!"}
{"text":"Lunch was Cheesecake ! my first experience of real american cheesecake, and worth the effort walking down the strip ..and back again to work the calories off !"}
{"text":"We wanted to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday while in Vegas. Hmm, where will they sing to her?

So even though I stuffed myself to the gills at the Village Buffet, we decided to surprise my friend for her birthday because that's how you show people you love them. We came at an off time, so there wasn't a wait. We sat upstairs (there is an elevator beside the staircase) at a round table in the corner. Hmm, what to eat when you don't want to eat? My friends ordered a bunch of appies, but I wanted to eat some veggies... lunch special sized Cobb Salad it is. When they dropped off the bread, everyone pounced. Ahh, I love the soft, warm bread with butter... I didn't really need to eat anymore.

The cobb salad is all mixed up instead of being a composed salad. It was very well mixed with an appropriate amount of dressing... not too little, not too much... just right. I love bacon... I love bacon with blue cheese... I love bacon with blue cheese and lettuce... this salad was huge, so I only finished like half. I would have taken it back to the hotel, but in a city of excess, I figured I would just find food someplace else... and I'm glad I did because I think our fridge was broken. The slice of red velvet cheesecake we took back did not fare so well... and melted. I almost cried.

Our server was so nice and even though she disappeared for a while, she remembered to bring a candle and brought some other to sing to my friend. We always have a nice time at all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants... always so consistent."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant,they offer different varieties of foods , delicious foods. They have professional staff, nice environment, good price , ofcourse Best cheese cake .just long waiting line so I recommend go early:)"}
{"text":"We were originally told there would be a 2 hour wait for our party of 8, however it only took 35 minutes. Nice! Service was good, food tastes great. Cocktail yummy!"}
{"text":"We had great service, and the food was good.  Much better than the one in San Francisco.  The food arived very quickly, the only bad thing was the noise level from some of the other patrons was loud."}
{"text":"Always love the Cheesecake Factory. This particular location ALWAYS has at least a 45-60 min wait. Food is always great."}
{"text":"I always come here for their happy hour! Amazing deals and great selections from the happy hour menu! My favorites are the road slider burgers with cheese& fried Mac and cheese balls! The drinks are delicious.. Kudos to the bartenders!Also, they have amazing service.. My favorite waiter is Javier.. He's super friendly and very attentive!"}
{"text":"We've had dinner at this location twice and had a great meal and service on both occasions.  I had the Steak Diane and my date had the chicken...both dishes were delicious!  The server was attentive and kept up with our beverages.  While it is moderately priced it was well worth it.  Finally, hardly any wait at all - we were seated within five minutes on both occasions.  I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory and this particular location to family and friends."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, the food is yummy and I enjoy the atmosphere. The first time I came here, I was a little disappointed in the service. It was crowded, but our waitress made it clear that she was flustered. She even got our bill wrong, charging us for items that we didn't order. It was a little frustrating. We decided to chalk it up to the possibility of her being new and inexperienced. 

The next time I came here - I had great service, great food and great cocktails. But still only 3 stars. I don't really like when the service fluctuates that much."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in two years.  Wow  I forgot how great this restaurant is.  Went here last night and it was great.  Service was on top of everything.  I ordered off the skinnylicous menu.  I had the Shrimp Creole, it was great huge portion with great flavor.  My wife had the salmon, it was a little dry but she still enjoyed.  We didn't get any desert but I am still thinking about the Oreo Deluxe Cheesecake, it looked amazing."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying the food was AMAZING as always. Now that that's out of the way, I am so completely upset that the recipe to the Banana Cheesecake was changed. It taste like a processed piece of cheesecake you buy from a piggly wiggly dime store. Thank you for allowing me to order it and take it home so excited and happy for the best cheesecake in the world and take a bite of that crap. I am so sad!!!"}
{"text":"All the tables were dirty and greasy. Silverware was filmy and the menus greasy. Wondered why there were 4 plus waiters just standing around yapping their mouths when they could have been wiping menus, cleaning tables or anything to help improve the ambience.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very Beautiful restaurant - that's about it.
I didn't expect fine dining but this was tasted like overpriced tv dinners.  It used to be ok now it just falls way short of acceptable."}
{"text":"The food wasn't the greatest, especially for the price I paid for my meal. The food was served cold and had zero flavor. I'm sad to say that the cheesecake we had after dinner tasted old... it had that old refrigerator taste, so the cheesecake was yucky too. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We ate a late lunch here on Tuesday. Arrived around 2:30pm and were seated immediately. My wife had the salmon lunch special with mashed potatoes and a small green salad. It was all delicious. I had the BLT Salad and it was also very good. Service was good as well. For dessert my wife had the standard cheesecake and I had the carrot cake. They were both incredible. This is a wonderful place to eat with good food, a good atmosphere, good service and great desserts."}
{"text":"I had a really great server there who checked back to my table often, and knew the menu very well.  The wait to get our food was longer than expected, and the food was fine.  Very large menu with lots of desserts.  They have some delicious cheesecake, obviously.  

When me and my family got there, we didn't have to wait to long (maybe 5-10 min.) and the meal pleased everyone.  The theme is like an ancient Egyptian style with interesting paintings on the ceiling  and good lighting.  

Of all the times I've gone there, I've had good servers, and food."}
{"text":"Waited for our food for about a good 30 minutes, not to mention the bread they gave us was hard and crunchy. Fresh bread ? I think not. It's ridiculous the wait time when it wasn't busy and they sat us down pretty quick. Other than that the food was pretty good. Would I go to Cheesecake Factory again? Of course I would. Would I come back to this one in the outlet mall? No way in hell"}
{"text":"We have been here about 8 times. It is a really big restaurant so it is unlikely that you will have a quiet and intimate meal. However, the food is always better than average and it is a great place to bring groups of 4 or more people. Also, the variety is unsurpassed unless you venture to a casino restaurant. 
We will continue to come here and it is definitely unique in the west to northwest part of town."}
{"text":"DID YOU KNOW ALL THE CHEESECAKE FACTORIES ARE THE SAME?  

I have been to a few of them, and this one was like the others.  If you like one where ever you are, then you'll like this one.  

SERVICE:  
The wait is long if you go around dinner time.  We waited, gambled, and drank to get a buzz and went later than 9:00 p.m.   So, we got seated fairly quickly.  The service...nothing special...it's what you'd expect at any Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  

FOOD QUALITY:  
The food was okay.  It was, as I said earlier, like any other Cheesecake Factory on the planet.  

WOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?: 
Probably not."}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience: my husband got his dinner, I ordered shrimp dinner, the waiter said mine would be 5 minutes late, the kitchen overlooked it and was making another; my granddaughter got her beef sandwich, no au jus, no salad and had to wait. Mine came and was almost 10 minutes late. A manager said 3 minutes, bad experience! Did not give a complimentary dinner ."}
{"text":"Great place for dinners for a date/families. Friendly employees great food and delicious cheesecake."}
{"text":"Orange chicken came out literally ice cold. We were so disgusted after taking a bite that we had to leave. Our server was also a jerk, and not very attentive...was more interested in hitting on his coworker (we were right next to the waiter station so it was impossible not to notice). Don't come here for anything other than cheesecake...and get it to-go."}
{"text":"Amazing food, always busy which might be a downfall because it translates to long waiting sometimes.

Yet I will always keep going there."}
{"text":"Love the steak of Diane. Plenty of dishes to like and choose from. Most of the items are delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes but the prices for a single cheesecake is ridiculous. 

The menu has so many options that it makes it hard to choose. I also hate all the ads in the menu!! Isn't this place big enough not to have ads. There always seems to be a wait even though there are plenty of open tables. Guess they just want us to think they are super busy. 

Definitely will come back for the cheesecake. Pumpkin is my families favorite."}
{"text":"Line started forming at 10 am -- and the restaurant opens at 11:30 am. Good thing we only had take-out. No line up there at noon. Service was good but had multiple issues with their interac connection. 
Ordered the pork belly sliders, bellagio, and two cheesecakes. All were good but the portion size of the cheesecake is small! Surprising since we have been to a few locations in the U.S. and the sizes are much bigger. This is what this restaurant is famous or infamous for --their gigantic serving. For $10 a slice it would have been nice to have the large portion as we've come to expect. (And before others may comment on how that'll be healthier for me in the long run, I share this with others or I eat it over a couple of days :-)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with the family. Excellent service and you're seated quickly. The food is always great and there are a ton of things to choose from. I highly recommend their Louisiana Chicken Pasta! Always on point. Love this place."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to The Cheesecake Factory. We were greeted nicely at the front door and shown to our table right away. This was nice as we don't usually wait, just a habit. 

Our waitress took our drink orders and gave us some time to wait for the rest of our party. When she brought our drinks she tried to drop them off and run, but I caught her and ordered an appetizer. The spinach, artichoke cheese dip was typical, nothing to rave about. 

Our party arrived and her drink order was taken and delivered. When our waitress came to take our order we had been catching up and my friend hadn't gotten a chance to look at the menu so she asked if our could be put in while she took a moment to look. 

The waitress walked away and I actually caught her rolling her eyes with a look of disgust on her face!

 When my friend had gotten a chance to decide she called her over and gave her the order. Our order that was put in about 5 minutes earlier than hers arrived almost 5 minutes after hers. 

I ordered a vegan club salad, it was great. 

My husband ordered the lemon herb chicken, it was so overboard on the lemon that was all he could taste. Most definitely not worth his money. 

My friend ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was so tough she had to borrow my husband's steak knife to cut it. 

All in all we waited longer than was necessary but we are OK with that as we were relaxing and enjoying each other's company. The waitress must of been having a bad day, but put on a smile and wasn't rude to our faces. Not worth the $100+ bill for three, may not go back, but may try another one for comparison."}
{"text":"Wow. I was so excited to visit the Cheesecake Factory in Vegas but never again. I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory so many times in California because it is one of my favorite restaurants for the quality and taste of food, consistency, and service. 

I always order a BBQ chicken salad every time I visit the Cheesecake Factory. The one I had in Vegas ruined this dish for me.  The salad was not fresh. The cucumbers were all soggy. Not only that, I found 4-5 lettuce head ends in my salad?! I've never experienced this, EVER!!!! Upon calling my server and showing him this, asking him if this is normal he stated \" a few can get in there but not this many\" he just asked if I was done with my salad, cleared the napkin I had with the lettuce heads and proceeded to bring my check. Exceptional service... buddy. Oh and thanks not checking up on us once during our entire dinner.....So disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy to not give it a good rating. Well not only that, but Cheesecake Factory's menu is just perfect. Literally has so many variety of items.
Want a burger? They got it.
Chinese? Got that too.
Pasta? You bet so.

Not only that, but they have AVOCADO ROLLS. One of the only places I know that has this. Just the best. Then to top it off, you get cheesecake for dessert! Just to finish some of the best dinner options ever, you get TWO pages of types of cheesecakes. LIKE,... WHAT? I think yes!"}
{"text":"Hi, 
I felt I had to share my experience with you since I will never eat at your establishment again during to the poor management staff you have at your ross park mall location.
On Monday afternoon my lunch guest and I ordered Renee's special. Nothing too complicated, right? We waited thirty five minutes for our meal and this entire time we never saw our waiter. He never filled our ice teas   or water or checked on us to pretend he even cared.
To really top this lunch trip off when we finally got our meal, our French onion soup was ice cold. Again, we didn't see our waiter until we were almost done with our meal, sans the soup. We told him our disappointment with the soup and wait time and he sent over a manager. The manager told us that HE forgot to turn the soup warmer on and offered to warm up our soup. THAT'S IT! After waiting for thirty five minutes you want me to wait while you warm up my soap?
I have never experienced such horrible customer in my life. I hope this will serve you on how to better train your management staff since they obviously need a lot of work."}

{"text":"I came here with my family for my aunt's birthday dinner. This was the first time my grandma has come down to visit from Cali, in months so we were all pretty excited. The staff was very friendly that day (we came on Saturday evening). Our server was nice and seemed very friendly and attentive. 

It appears my Grandma had stopped by this location before coming to our house so that she could put in the order for my aunt's favorite cheesecake. Apparently when we got the restaurant , she forgot the receipt back at our place. Fortunately, the guy who was our server was able to locate our order. 

The reason for the 3 stars is the slow service. They didn't appear very busy, yet it took over 20 minutes for my aunt to get her drink even though we all had our drinks and food already. We told three different employees about the drink and still had to wait and wait.

Overall, good service (just slow) and good food."}
{"text":"My first cheesecake factory experience. It's beautiful design and friendly staff added to the delicious meal and incredible cheesecake. The staff was on the ball. We had an enjoyable time. Couldn't eat all the cheesecake... great treat later!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and brought all visitors here because they have such a diverse menu. Something for everyone. After a bad experience a few years ago  I talked my mom into going since we were in the neighborhood. 

Staff is friendly and sitting outside is always a plus but that is where is the good review ends. 

I had a Korean chicken burger that had nice flavor but was literally a giant piece of chicken on a soggy bun with a few shredded carrots on top (cole slaw). It was the sadest looking burger. I mistakenly got a side salad instead of fries which was just soggy lettuce. That's it. The kind of lettuce that was mixed with dressing early in the morning and put in the refrigerator and served throughout the day. It was inedible. My mom unfortunately got a salad as well and I think they must have pulled the same lettuce for her. She didn't even eat half her salad. And the waitress didn't even ask us if something was wrong with it. Thank goodness for the bread!

Not sure I will be back but I sure miss the old Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Delicious food, menu is a touch overwhelming but our server was incredibly patient with us. Services was impeccable! Thanks Deena!"}

{"text":"The girlfriend and I drove an hour to Westlake for her birthday dinner @ The Cheesecake Factory. She ordered the cobb salad, I ordered some Asian salad thing. First screw-up was when the waitress didn't bring my salad dressing. BINGO! I knew this was going to be a bad experience. She didn't come to check on us after dropping off our food. I had to get up and find someone to bring me dressing. Really? And I'm paying $12.00 for a salad. Usually I don't complain, but a server has one job. SERVE. If you can't do the basics, find a new job."}

We were not checked on again until we were done eating!! Never going back!!!!  What once was a decent place to grab a bite has gone downhill!!!"}
{"text":"Dear cheesecake factory:  is this your best?
We were celebrating with family over some great news and chose your establishment to enjoy creating this family memory. 
Unfortunately,  it will be remembered as the memory from a place not to go. We arrived and checked in with our party of 7 just around 6 pm. We were told that all the beepers were dying and to return later to get one. We checked in every 15 min and finally got one. Then we were told to wait a while longer. 
It was just past 9 when our dinner order was taken. Some of the table was able to order appetizers and other half  was only offered to order beverages.  The food finally arrived and was mediocre at best with 2 of our diners not liking the entre. It wasnt until the dinner plates were being cleared from the table that we had a opportunity  to express dissatisfaction with the food. We were offered to order something else but at this point everyone else was done with the meal and table cleared.
Honestly, the 4 hour experience wasn't worth the wait or the insult of finding that parking ticket on our window after. Spending such a disappointing amount of time at your establishment.  
Getting  slapped with a parking ticket was quite a surprise since we parked in your lot and went along  the ridiculousness  required to eat there. Clearly  spending our time and money at your establishment was a very bad idea.
Memories taken that night include: the 2.5 hours plus for a table. The not so great food, unrecognized disatisfaction with 2 meals or checking back in a timely fashion to see, and lastly the 30 dollar ticket. I hope it's very clear to you we will never be back and we have taken the time to alert friends and family of things to expect should they still feel like throwing away time and money here. #Sorrynotsorry #disappointmentatthecheesecakefactory"}
{"text":"This is a must see if you're a Canadian. Every time we're in the States, we make it our mission to find a Cheesecake Factory. 

The menu is huge and everything I've ever tried is delicious. The portions are also huge and the price is extremely reasonable. Make sure to take a doggy bag because you MUST save room for dessert! Their cheesecake is heavenly! We had the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and I've never tasted something so delicious in my life. 

The service is also always great here as well and they give you bread before your meal. 

What more could you want in a restaurant. My only criticism is that they don't have any locations in Canada. I beg you Cheesecake Factory, please come to Canada!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service was BAD! There were five of us and our food came out in three different deliveries instead of one. Four of us were finished with our meal before the 5th person even got his food! I think the worst part was nobody offered to comp his meal or even a dessert. And then we waited 30 minutes for our cheesecake! Wont be going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for an affordable price and large portions. I love to come for lunch. There is a good selection to choose from and even healthier options. Also if u want to cheat a little there's always delicious cheesecakes to choose from. Solo many of them!"}
{"text":"Being from south side I frequent the Cheesecake Factory quite a bit.
I called tonight to place a to go order. They kept me on hold for 8 mins and 40sec. Which I feel is completely unacceptable. When I asked to spoke to the manager he seemed more irritated that I was wasting his time with my complaint rather then trying to rectify the problem.
I will NEVER visit this location again. I can spend my money where it is more appreciated."}
{"text":"What can I say i like this place, it isn't special. But I do love the Steak Dianne and Chicken Madiera..."}
{"text":"The cheesecake recipe has changed. The service was surly and slow. My sever barely spoke to me. I felt sad. The cake is foamy and not creamy anymore. A sad disappointment all around. The music outside was good. It was R&B.

It's so nice of the corporate arm to respond to me. I still recall how the server served me under my arm behind me, as if to hide his face. He didn't check on me after that underhanded serve. I still feel sad about that decision to go there and try to have fun. 

When the surly waiter discovered that all I wanted was a piece of cheesecake, he became pushy and then, dismissive. 

You're known for cheesecake. You even made up your own recipe for cheesecake, if my mouth is a good food sleuth. I used to go to a cafe at the Ritz Carleton on North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and just have dessert. Plenty of people go to a place for a dessert course. Your waiter was too poorly trained to be aware of that. He insulted me.  

Thank you to The Cheesecake Factory for the nice apology."}
{"text":"My go to take out restaurant. Whether I'm sitting at home and can't think of anything to eat Cheesecake Factory is always delicious with more then enough items to choose from. The Louisiana chicken pasta is my all time favorite menu item. If you are looking for a nice semi casual dinner with friends, family, or clients, Cheesecake Factory is always a great choice!"}
{"text":"It's amazing when you have one weird experience and then it happens again at the same location. Took my husband for his birthday and as usual had a nice table and a very friendly waiter at least in the beginning. Didn't have the bread we wanted and said it was cooking. Took order then i announced I would like a cake for his bday. He said no prob. Then we never saw him again. Another waiter brought the meals and another waiter never introduced herself. This happened 2x! He could of said I will be leaving now and ... Will take over. Never got the bread that was baking. Then the other waiter said to go that she will give us the white bread and full roll. Wrapped in foil the bread was dark. Omg then she overcharged for desert etc etc.....
I love the factory but something doesn't seem right."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is the best overall restaurant on the West Side.  We go there 2-3 times a week and rarely have a problem.  Have never had a problem with the service.  Give it a try. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years and never had problems until recently.  One one occasion I ordered the chicken piccata.  I was given chicken Alfredo.  I sent it back and it came out very quickly, the kitchen added lemon and capers to the Alfredo.  WRONG!  Again it went back and this time I got a reasonable facsimile of a piccata.  The next time I went in the bartender Chelsea ignored me for almost 20 minutes.  When she finally did come over she was rude and treated me like a second class subhuman piece of trash.  Today I went back and Chelsea was working again.  I had just returned from a hiking trip with friends and sat in the back of a Jeep for six hours.  I just wanted to have a drink and relax while I waited for an Uber to pick me up.  Unfortunately Chelsea's girlfriend was sitting at the bar and didn't shut up from the moment I walked in to the moment I left.  I'm not saying it's wrong to have friends come in when your working and everyone has the right to express themselves but there is a limit and boundaries need to be set.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory, you had your three strikes!"}
{"text":"Good, but not worth to wait for an hour or two. Those who are allowed time are worth trying."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had no wait for a table. Server was very attentive and gave us more time to peruse the extensive menu. Samosas were very good. Orange chicken actually had an orange taste. Loved that brown rice was available for the teriyaki chicken which unlike some places, was not overly salty and was all white meat. Portions are huge even for the lunch time size. Would prefer less food and lower price. Shared the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake which was outstanding."}
{"text":"I had the onion soup and Chipotle Chicken pasta. My wife had the onion soup, a Caesar salad and the crab and artichoke dip. Service from José our waiter was excellent and he is the only reason I gave two stars.

The onion soup was extremely salty, neither of us could have more than a few sips. The Chipotle Chicken pasta was decent but nothing to write about it. The crab artichoke dip was not good, I had one bite. My wife ate her Caesar salad, but it was nothing spectacular. 

We hadn't been here in years and for $60 plus tip for a so-so meal, it'll be years again. I guess we'll stick to BJ's brewery from now on."}
{"text":"I am always pleased with my food, waiter, server, greeters, everything. Cleanliness of a 10/10. It may just be this location but they seriously won't let you down"}
{"text":"you cant go wrong with the factory.  i was a bit skeptical about this particualr one, especially sucha large hi traffic location we were seated right away on a fridayafternoon, i had athe shrimp blt and green iced tea, service was great and attentive , i guess they need to get customer out with a quickness..somewhat pricey , but almost evrything on their menu you cant go wrong,"}
{"text":"The 1 star is definitely not for the customer service. Our server was really nice and sweet. The bad review was for the food, its for the taste and quality of the food. We ate at other locations before but never extremely impressed with the food, but at this location I ordered the burrito. I was fighting all night to keep it down, in the end the burrito won. The food was disgusting  and what wasn't disgusting had no taste at all whatsoever.  There were 7 of us total, and everyone was complaining of their food. My main question for the cook is how on earth can you cook the black beans, and make them tasteless? Definitely not planning to visit this location anytime soon. The time wasted waiting for a table and then paying a crapload of $ for crappy food. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was cold, service was non- existent, and the hostess was incredibly preoccupied with her cell phone than seating anyone. Will pass this mega-chain next time."}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory has always been my favorite restaurant. I have been to them pretty much everywhere around the states. Well, the one here in Vegas at Caesar's Palace wasn't the best experience. Fist off the hostess had an attitude. Second, the waiter seemed to be annoyed that we arrived at 10:30pm when they don't close until 11:30pm. I guess he wanted to get out early?? He didn't bring bread, our food came and we had to ask for bread. He didn't bring water, so we had to ask for water. Never came to check on us except to see if we needed to go boxes. Just a bad experience."}
{"text":"We ate here today, unfortunately.  The food took forever and a day to arrive.  When it finally did arrive it obviously had been living under a heat lamp for most of the time we waited.  I'm surprised it didn't have mold on it.  My wife ordered the ham and cheese omelet.  The cheese was cooked to a crisp...it resembled peanut brittle.  She actually sent it back because it was nasty.  The waitress agreed it was overcooked and placed an order for another one.  The second one took so long we just cancelled our order.  In the time we waited I asked for a water more than three times.  When we left one of my kids left a bag under the chair with a toy in it.  We returned a few minutes later and my wife asked a waiter if he had seen the bag.  He said \"we already threw it in the trash and threw the trash in the dumpster.\"  Assuming the guy just didn't want to look for it she said \"so you can't get it back?\" He said \"what do you want me to do, go dumpster diving?\"  Besides the fact the waiter was a complete jerk I'm shocked they managed to empty the trash 100x faster than they could deliver the food we ordered.  I will not be going back to the Cheesecake Factory!  Unbelievably bad experience."}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary. I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service. However, the food was not at what we expected at all! We ordered the shrimp rolls which looked like there was shrimp in the roll but they cut it into what it looked like thirds or halves to make it look like there was more shrimp than there actually was. Also the rice paper kinda grossed us out. We had never had it before, it was very rubbery. Our entrees came out and my pasta was very bland and the orange chicken was something we could have made at home. Our drinks and cheesecake were the best part of our whole dinner. We were disappointed because we were hoping for a nice dinner for our anniversary."}
{"text":"No reservations after 5pm, what kind of joint are you running, I'm already not a fan of your corporate set up or your food and now I can't make a reservation for a birthday party, ridiculous, I know where I don't want to go for my birthday. I'm taking a group of 15 people to a place I don't want to go to and I get to pay and I can't even get a table set up, Wow that's awesome"}
{"text":"Good environment, I ordered the famous meatloaf and it is large but a little bit salty. The waitress is not that friendly but overall I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Waited on my potatoes and was told they were unavailable after everyone else got their food. I had to wait on my food while my group ate. My replacement mash had a large chicken bone in it and I am vegetarian. It was pretty disgusting. We had to wait 30 mins for our food. The service was slow and very disappointing."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is a place to indulge high calorie meals in a \"luxury\" Midwestern setting. The Cheesecake Factory in West Towne is slightly on the tacky side--with seating in the mall hallway and hostesses with tons of makeup, the restaurant is more of a casual dining place than a fancy, upscale restaurant. The atmosphere is not inviting: parties waiting to be seated are crowed around the entry space; the place is chaotic. 

        However, once I was seated after the usual 30-40 minute wait, my waiter was very friendly and the food came right away. All of the dishes are savory and rich, and the portion size is massive. I would recommend splitting an entree and a slice of the legendary cheesecake with a friend; you will have more than enough food. The only downside is the price: in my opinion, twenty dollars for a pasta dish is a bit too expensive. Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is a great place to try if you are starving, as I guarantee you will not be leaving hungry. However, I wasn't a fan of the fake luxury decor, nor the high-priced entrees."}
{"text":"Really bad pizza,super slow serving cramberry is fake coke was not as normal 1 apple juice is 3/4water and  costs much the pizza was burned room tempeture is like it was inbtge freezer to them
I dont recommend  in,n out is way better!"}
{"text":"The food is fairly good but for the price I think it leaves some to be wanted. Our server was pretty good but we had one of those awkward moments where everyone's food was brought out except one person. So everyone politely didn't eat until the other food arrived (only 3-4 minutes later) and we enjoyed some awkward silence. I think ideally they should have just waited to bring everyone their food."}
{"text":"Awful service, awful drinks and the whole place seemed to be a mess. Love Cheesecake Factory, this location just sucks unfortunately."}
{"text":"They have ridiculously high prices for Mediocre food and mediocre service.  Save ur money and eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"my wife and I went there on new years day and the service was great. got a seat right away. I had the factory burrito grande and it was fantastic, she had a past dish which  was great too (not exactly sure the name of the dish) we were to full to have any desert..maybe it was because of all the complimentary bread they bring to you before hand.."}
{"text":"We had a group of 11 we waited a hour for a table took almost 30 minutes to even order our food I understand it was a Friday night. Although it was busy l thought once we sat down we would understand at least be taken care of But it wasn't that way at all. After we order the food waitress was not to be found for a while. Then it took 20 minutes to bring the ticket. I was very disappointed in the service and the long waits. The food was amazing and that is why I give the stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch the other day at Cheesecake factory and let me tell you, the food and service was absolutely amazing. My wife had the Four Cheese Pasta, which was delicious. I know this, because it looked so good I had to try some. I had the Pasta Da Vinci which also was very tasty. Are waitress Melissa was very helpful with the menu. She also recommended that we try there fabulous cheesecake, which we did. We had the Pina Colada Cheesecake, yummy. We will definitely come back. And we will ask for Melissa again. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for a amazing dinner and a great experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there on a Wednesday after the lunch crowd was gone.  The interior decor is very \"Vega\" and generally attractive.  The food, not so much.  It is true that you eat first with your eyes and the Cobb Salad they served was not a vision to behold.  When it came to the table for my husband, my first thought was that it looked like someone had thrown up on the plate.  There was a huge mound of green, wet, limp lettuce strips in the middle (including other ingredients) with julienne cut eggs (more like dried out spears) forming a moat around the bottom of the mound.  They forgot the bacon which was just as well since the server said they were \"bacon bits.\"  I have had a lot of Cobb Salads and this was without a question the poorest example of one I had seen or tasted.  Sorry to come down so hard but it was a lot of money for not very good product.  The server was nice but there is a definite push to get you to buy desserts."}
{"text":"I think this place is a great choice for food for a couple of reasons: price, location, food and outdoor seating.  Located in Boca Park near Suncoast and Badlands Golf Course, it is part of shopping complex that has many draws besides the restaurant.

The average price for this excellent quality of food is around $10-$15 dollars for an entree.  The desserts (the Cheesecakes, of course) are anywhere from $6 to $8.  I ordered Chicken Madiera with Steak Diane (a combo plate) that cost $19.99.  They bring out a couple different types of bread before your meal that will hold you over for the 30-45 minute wait for food (this place is usually always busy).

The food itself, I believe, is excellent.  it may not be at every location but with a Gordon Biersch next door, they have to step up the quality.  The steak I had was complimented nicely with mashed potatoes that weren't simply mashed potatoes; the meat was covered in a tasty mushroom wine sauce while the chicken was topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese (also with a mushroom sauce).

The desserts are excellent as well...they should be considering the name of the restaurant.  We had the Vanilla Bean (my son will only eat Vanilla) and Chocolate Oreo Mudslide Cheesecakes; both were rich and tasty and something we would order again.

The service here is as to be expected for such a busy restaurant.  We sat outside where there are fans and mist machines to keep you cool.  It was much quieter and less cramped; you also have a nice view of either the condo's next to Suncoast or the valley below.

The menu is expansive, I only covered what I ate, but I would try many other dishes here (I have in the past, all have been excellent).  The restaurant looks a lot fancier and expensive than it really is.  There isn't a kids menu so plan to order a full meal for them or just share like I did...there is plenty to go around!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars it would be fine with me.  I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before so my son took me while I am visiting in Las Vegas.  What a HUGE disappointment overall.  Why do people rave about this place?  

Here are some examples:  Our table was 14\" away from the next person and the waitress had to crane her arm to serve each table stuffing her elbow in my son's face more than once.  Next I ordered the Fish N' Chips, on the recommendation of the waitress, only to be served breaded cardboard over soggy chips.  I was hard pressed to find the dry fish anywhere on that plate.  The coleslaw was a jumble of minced vegetables with some kind of light dressing which did not resemble anything I've ever known called coleslaw.  My son ordered a hamburger and out came this smallish, overcooked (even though he asked for mid-rare) dry burger, again with soggy fries. I could go on about the line-up of people waiting for a table while the staff were all talking and giggling and paying no attention to the patrons. Etc.

The whole experience was terrible and nothing like we expected.  We paid the bill and left, never to return to this or any location.  However, when I talked to my other son and told him of our ordeal he was shocked and said that it must be the location because he has had delicious food in the Denver location.  Just our luck!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, but very expensive.  I had a gift card otherwise we wouldn't have gone.  I had a amazing raspberry martini, but it cost $10.50!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible, went there in June 8th. Got seated right away... My girlfriend then right away went to the restroom, came back, then I went to the restroom... And we waited, and waited. Mind you no one had acknowledged that we were there. Bussers, waiters, would walk by, and nope not even a \"Hi, have you been helped, yet?\" Nothing. So after maybe 20 minutes of waiting we finally grab a waiter walking by and ask to speak to a manager there. Again, another 10 minutes. When she did show up, I was suprised. Very unproffesional. Very, very unprofessional. Like she didnt care. So it turns out the reason we were just there, sitting was because the \"section\" was closed... Horrible experience. Dont go there. The waiters dont care. The manager didnt care. Dont go there."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The service?  My husband wasn't impressed. Since he pays the bill, it counts for something.  Our waiter was friendly.  My husband wanted a salad before his meal.  He did get a dish of ranch dressing, the salad was forgotten and brought with his meal. \"They overcooked the salad,\" was his comment about it.
We had to flag the waiter down a couple of times to get what we wanted.  Even the bill took forever to get.  It was a Monday night. There weren't that many customers. 
Overall, I recommend the restaurant. I know we'll be coming back. My husband didn't have enough room to try the cheesecake.  Odd, since it's one of his favorite desserts."}
{"text":"I would personally stay away from any of their pasta dishes but their gumbo is really delicious. This also happens to be my favorite Cheesecake Factory location to date, but it is also the busiest location I`ve been to. Thankfully the giant fish tank located right in front of the restaurant is a great source of distraction, especially if you have kids.  Quick and friendly service, great family environment."}
{"text":"I rated this two stars rather than one because I cannot deny the fact that the food is delectable, every single time. However, this was my second time at this location & compared to others, it just is not up to par. First off, it took us nearly 10 minutes sitting in the bar to be asked if we even wanted water. No server to be found. Upon asking of a server after being tired of waiting, we got one, who all night long was less than attentive. The only thing he did was take our order. Everything else; drink refills, food being brought out, bread, someone else did. It was as if we had 5 waiters. Our food took nearly 30 minutes. For two pastas. Which I will say, were amazing, I highly recommend the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce, it never disappoints. This location definitely needs some work though. And no, it's not that it is overly busy because it is at the mall, i've seen busier and bigger, some re training may be in order for the wait staff, or a reality check for management, since every table around us had the same problem even with different waiters/waitresses , and some even got tired of waiting for their cheesecake because they were \"out\". Very disappointing for such an expensive upper scale restaurant."}
{"text":"We came in here on a Sunday night and had the worst experience EVER. I love cheesecake factory but the service was horrible. We waited for 45 mins for our table, got seated & waited another 20 mins to get greeted. Our food came out cold and the server never came back once to check up on us once he delivered our food. We complained to the manager and he was nice enough to comped our dinner and apologized to us."}
{"text":"My first time in a cheesecake factory in 10 years and the quality has gone down tremendously. Service was fine if a bit pushy (really wanted to turn tables) but the food was just horrid. Sure, you are getting big portions but the quality was so low. It was just a hair above canteen slop.

I guess the good thing was that it didn't cost much."}
{"text":"Have never had a bad meal at any Cheesecake Factory and this one was no different. We were there on November 28 for a late lunch. We had no wait time. We received excellent service and the portions were large. Their bread basket is a great start. We shared their Asian or Oriental Chicken Salad, the Artichoke Appetizer and each got a piece of huge cheesecake (of course!) The food was delicious and the Cheesecake was sinfully rich. Loved every minute of it!  I would recommend them and  go again."}
{"text":"This particular Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants in town!  My family and I have been dining here since 2005! We've celebrated birthdays and anniversaries and it's always at the top of our list whenever we plan on celebrating a special occasion. The service is always phenomenal. The wonderful, helpful and friendly staff are genuine and are always there to greet you and make sure your experience is memorable. It's a fact that The Cheesecake Factory invests an average of $3,000 per employee on training - and it most definitely shows! 

In addition, the food is always fresh and fast and the hearty-sized portions will leave you satisfied with some leftovers to take to work the following day! Over time we've  tried dozens of the items on their menu and we've never been disappointed. We look forward to the warm bread and butter that they serve you as soon as you're seated (TIP: Ask for a side of shredded Parmesan cheese with the bread and dip the buttered slices into the cheese! WOW!).

It is very uncommon, but there were instances where mistakes in the order did occur, such as forgetting to remove the chicken when asked, or having a dish served cold. But when brought to their attention, they will always be extra sincere and apologetic and will always reimburse you to your satisfaction, so I won't take points off for that!

When all is said and done, I have yet to find a restaurant with the quality of food and service that this particular Cheesecake Factory has to offer!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at. Amazing staff. Quick and definitely my favorite place for desert lol"}
{"text":"Awesome prices for awesome portions!!! The menu is huge! I've been eating here for years and never experienced bad service or bad food! The Bistro Rock Shrimp pasta is very tasty, Fish Tacos are filling, Jambalaya Pasta is one of the best, Tex Mex rolls are delicious!!!! The whole menu which is like a bible is wonderfully appetizing!!!! Lines are long get there early for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and I must say they are on their A game today. I had the fried cod sandwich and the buffalo blast , as well as some freshly made avocado dip. All of which tasted very good. The atmosphere was really nice and I love the selection of music. It was a nice cool vibe once the cool air came through. It was a bit stuffy at first. Great Monday evening."}
{"text":"Went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time in a long time. Boy was it mediocre! My wife and I walked in at about 3:30PM and it was almost entirely empty. My wife is currently walking with a cane as she is recovering from knee replacement surgery. The hostess greeted us and promptly told us it would be about a five minute wait - please have a seat. WHAT??? five minute wait in an empty restaurant??? Did she see the cane? Does she know that 95% of the tables are wide open? I am not exaggerating, it was 95% EMPTY!!!! 

OK, let it go... she was stupid. We were seated in about three minutes - just long enough for my wife to uncomfortably sit down and stand back up again. 

Food took a LONG time to come out - especially considering how busy the kitchen was (sarcasm). I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad from their new \"skinnylicious\" menu. My wife had the Steak Diane/Chicken Madiera combo. Hers was what you'd expect - typical Cheesecake Factory OK meal. Mine on the other hand was UNDERWHELMING. Our server informed me that the salmon on this salad usually comes cold, unless I would like it heated. I opted for warmed. Big mistake. Their idea of warmed seemed to be microwaved to the point of shriveled and hard around the edges. Also their idea of salad seemed to be dump some greens out of a bag o' salad and dress it up with a couple of sticks of asparagus. Come on guys... make me a fresh piece of fish and use some higher quality greens. Like I said, UNDERWHELMING!

I really expect that in a restaurant, they should be able to prepare/cook a piece of fish better than I can at home. I also expect freshly cooked, not what had to be cooked yesterday (or last week) before it went bad and then refrigerated to hold it for leftovers for the salad. 

Lots of staff standing around with a dirty floor. No one seemed to care. My guess is POOR MANAGEMENT and POOR TRAINING. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, but you have slipped about three notches and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's a day early to beat the crowd. Christine was our server but I wish she wasn't. I ordered the mahi special it was disgusting. There was so much runny chunky tomato on top of the fish and mashed potatoes it was more like a soup. So if you like your fish, tomatoes, and potatoes all swimming together you might like it. I didn't say anything. I know the server noticed me trying to recuse my potatoes from drowning. So she said she was leaving and Jennifer would be taking over. Well I don't think Jennifer was even there yet. 10-15 minutes go by meanwhile Christine is still taking care of the table next to us. Finally Jennifer! She was only there to put in our cheesecakes to go and grab the check. I wish she had been our server the whole time. Night and day difference."}
{"text":"OK... You go to Cheesecake for the broad menu and maybe a slice of cheesecake. The service is typically good, however our experience here was horrible. Each of the special order requests (dressing on the side etc.) were not honored and there was no offer to remedy that. I literally had to put my hands around my mouth (you know... yell style) and almost yell to get our servers attention after she walked past us 3x without checking on us. We had asked for water and hadn't received it after being sat for 10 minutes. I eventually had to walk up to the hostesses to ask them to track our server down. Checked on Yelp after we ate and laughed... 3 out of 5 stars for a Cheesecake Factory? I wonder if this place is under corporate watch for improvement? Very unimpressed, there are many other better options. Steer clear!"}
{"text":"It's hard to review the Cheesecake Factory because honestly, if you can't find anything on the menu there's no hope. The food is good and the waiters are always very attentive when we go. Best time to go is on a week day during lunch time. Weekends get crowded which is very understandable for anything attached for a mall. But we always call ahead to see what the wait time is before showing up. Don't forget to stop by the cheesecake counter or get the eggroll sampler! It's a chain so my expectations are lower than a 5 star steakhouse."}
{"text":"Tonight we ventured into the Cheesecake Factory for a dessert and cappuccino.  We have frequented this location many times and like so many times before, this experience was great.  The low-carb cheesecake and pumpkin cheesecake was perfect.  The server was nice and prompt.  We could not ask for anything better.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for providing us dessert which was by far the best thing we had eaten all day!"}
{"text":"Great food as usual!  Staff was fantastic and our server was amazing!  Only issue was the seating process.  they took our name, had us come back after 15 minutes, and then made us all stand there for another 15 minutes (there were about 20 other groups waiting too).  it would be much better to either have a buzzer option or maybe a text option.  I've been to the Cheesecake factory all over the country - seating hasn't been an issue before so maybe this is new."}
{"text":"The service at this location is terrible, even if the food is good. My girlfriend and I have gone on two separate occasions and we were consistently ignored by the servers. They were too focused on the older and elderly groups at the restaurants and didn't help us when we needed it. Our most recent waitress was very disrespectful after we asked for a change in our order. We both felt very uncomfortable continuing to sit there. I've had better service at Olive Garden. 

The food is incredible however. If the service wasn't lacking I'd recommend this place just for its food to anyone."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I have ever received in a restaurant. 

We went to cheesecake factory on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30 for lunch. My friend and her boyfriend arrived before myself and two of my other girlfriends so they were first seated. So after we arrived, they were waiting for 10 minutes for a server. A total of 30 minutes pass by and still no word from a server!!! We just wanted atleast water to start the night off. We alerted a manager by the name of Adam Paige that we haven't been helped for 30 minutes and he showed absolutely no care that we've been waiting. He just said \"ok\". I was a host for two restaurants and I am fully aware how the restaurant business is. Either the host didn't notify the server or the server didn't know the section. Finally our server came to our table saying \"Sorry, I walked past you guys so many times and didn't even know you were my table\". We didn't know how to take that response so we just said it's okay. We finally got our drinks in and then she came back later to take our orders. Some people from my party ordered off the lunch menu, I myself did not. I ordered a Salmon crusted salad. We waiting for 45 minutes for our food to arrive and finally received it. Everyone enjoyed their food and as did I. When we all were full, the server came and asked if we wanted boxes. One of my friends who finished eating before me had her salad boxed by the server but I don't mind boxing my own salad, I thought my server had better things to do than to box my salad. With the salads being huuge, I only touched half of my plate. As I was putting my salad into a box, I KID YOU NOT, TWO FRUIT FLIES WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY SALAD. At first I thought, WAIT this cannot be right I must be seeing things. So I closed my togo box and told my friends. As I opened it, I had 4 witnesses seeing flies come out of my salad. so I immediately closed it again. At this point, I was so so disgusted. If two flies were still alive, I cannot imagine how many dead ones I ate. Maybe they were in the lettuce packaging when they made the salad, I do not know. But I sure as hell know what I saw. Me and My friend approached Adam Paige to let him know what was in my salad. I still cannot believe how UNPROFESSIONAL he was. I handed the box of food and said there were fruit flies in my salad. All he said was do you want another one..... ANOTHER ONE!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? There was no sincere apology, no I am so sorry, he didn't even offer to comp the salad. The SERVER asked me if he will comp it. I just couldn't believe this experience, and it just manages to get worse and worse!!!! All my friends who ordered off the lunch menu were charged full price. Our food was on one receipt, and the manager kept on entering it incorrectly. Finally after the third try a different manager comes to my table to clarify what happened with the receipt. He knew what happened to my salad because he comped it but didn't even apologize for MY experience, just apologized for changing the receipt so many times. I am still in shock at how horrific the experience was. Just wow."}
{"text":"I prefer local eateries but I did enjoy my meal at the Cheesecake factory at Kierland commons. Our server Ashley is a sweetheart and great care of my dairy allergy. The steamed dumplings were delicious :)"}
{"text":"Literally the WORST service ever!!!! My boyfriend also got food poisoning from eating their salmon. Love The Cheesecake Factory but definitely wouldn't recommend this location.."}
{"text":"Of course this place is known for the delicious cheesecake but tonight's service left something to be desired. We waited 10min to even be greeted by a server. Another 5 to get waters. Our server  just didn't seem to attentive. Not very personable. Our food was ok at best. I only go here for the cheesecake and I think from now in, I'll stick to just that."}
{"text":"The crispy crab bites on the lite appetizers menu are pretty awesome. You only get about 5 or 6, but they are super tasty and will not fill you up for your huge entree. I also ordered the Cuban sandwich. It's not your typical Cuban that's on a slim, pressed bun, but it's a huge sandwich that's you'd get at a typical sub sandwich place. I was kind of disappointed by that since Cuban sandwiches should be made a certain way. It tastes good though!"}
{"text":"This Chandler location has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The General Manager, Ariana, was extremely unhelpful in getting the matter resolved. I had to write to corporate office, which was much more understanding and was the epitome of customer service. For that reason, and from other reviews I have read there, it is THIS location that has bouts of poor customer service. The other locations are fine. Our large events will be held elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very good service for a group lunch.  Food is good and lots of menu choices, regardless of your diet type.  

and of course.... great cheesecake!"}
{"text":"First if you haven't been here prepare yourself mentally. It's huge! And has some very obnoxious people come to eat here, this is not the place for a date or a night out with a good friend or two. You can barely hear yourself at times from the echoes of others talking. Food is good - prices are fair but cheesecake is nothing to brag about. I've had better from my local grocer. On the other hand the place is not too shabby for a group night out but they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch portion Herb crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus , salmon and asparagus was good but the mashed potatoes were gooey and gross. Service was good our waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"The shrimp with angel hair was just like home-made paste by cooking with vegan pasta sauce. The flavor in sauce and in noodles are not well combined. 
The low carb cheesecake was using Splenda to replace regular sugar, while the Splenda has wired aftertaste. 
And everything is really OVERPRICED!!!!!"}
{"text":"Even though this is a chain restaurant, I love the vibe. The am also grateful for the new gluten free menu. The service is also great. I only wish they would bring back their beet burger (the way it was made about 8 years ago).  Hint, hint...."}
{"text":"Wow what can i say about this place. I love the Cheesecake Factory. This is by far the best place to eat. My favourite restaurant when i visit the U.S.


 Serves the best food and desserts. You cant go wrong with anything on the menu. Theres so much choice. You could eat there every single day for 2 weeks and have something different everytime. I love the Club sandwich and Lindas Fudge Cake or any of the Cheesecakes for dessert.
Like pretty much most places in America the portions are HUGE and the place is super clean!


 Its always busy and theres quite a wait for a table but thats understandable as that shows what a great place it is. Its definetly worth the wait!
Nowhere else can compete with the Cheesecake Factory in my opinion.


 I highly recommend eating here. Unfortunatly 5 stars is the highest you can give, because this place easily gets 10 stars ! :)"}
{"text":"There's a enormous selection of food to choose from- so not only cheescakes here.  I had dinner here, had the chipotle pasta, etc... There was a long wait for our food after we ordered- about 30 minutes... The food was good, everything was cooked okay, but was not a fan of the bread in the basket- the taste was bit off.  Our service was okay and the waiter checked on us throughout our meal.  I did try their cheesecake- nothing too different from any other one.  The only thing I could suggest to the restaurant is maybe increase the lighting just a bit more."}
{"text":"Well it is the same as everyother cheesecake factory in existence. Food was good, staff was friendly, and prices are reasonable. Only complaint is that the menu is almost as long as a bible."}
{"text":"Horrible experience for the second time...guess I've learned my lesson....our food was ice cold and when we asked our server to warm it up she combined the food (from a split dish) onto the same damn plate!! After bites were taken! Good thing it was only my mom and her bite showed me which piece of chicken was hers...the food came back and the sides were still ice cold! Never had a drink refill...never saw a manager...server stood around and chatted it up with the busboys....we will not be returning...it's a shame too..it used to be a really nice place to go."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was horrible. Call it what you will, but everything went wrong, in terms of service. 

First, we asked for a table inside for just the two of us. The lady said ok and the wait would be about 5-7 minutes. Well, a whole bunch of people came in after us and they all got seated before us. After a while, I went up and asked if we were still on the list. The lady said, \"Oh, yea....here's your table.\" No apology or anything. We sat down and my girlfriend was a little mad. 

The server seemed nice, but after receiving our food....someone messed that up too. She ordered white rice with the gumbo but got the regular brown rice. My girlfriend accepted the food anyway, but again....she was not happy. 

Overall, it was a bad experience. We still like the Cheesecake Factory, but I would probably recommend another one in town. This one isn't up to par."}
{"text":"It was the first time that I dined at a Cheesecake Factory and it will likely be my last.  The wait time wasn't bad at all even though it appeared very busy.  The waitress was pleasant but seemed rushed.  She filled our drink orders promptly which is a big plus.  It was very noisy but aesthetically pleasing.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was adequate.  We ordered the ribeye steak medium rare for our main course. It came out well done.  They offered to cook another one for us but we didn't think they the next steak would be prepared any better so we just ordered some pasta.  The waitress never apologized for this inconvenience. The pasta was pretty bland but edible.  Overall it was not worth the time or money that we spent there.  If your going to go to a chain restaurant stick to Outback, they at least know how to cook a steak."}
{"text":"The Chicken Madeira and Steak Dianne combo is terrific!! I always ask for extra sauce and they happily give it to me. Most days I go here the service is great. I think in all the times I come here, which is often, I have only had 1 bad server but I've never had bad food. The Texmex egg rolls are delicious and you can't go wrong with any of the cheese cakes."}
{"text":"The bomb.com!!! Eat here, leave happy!! The food will put you in a food coma! Cat fish was da bomb!"}
{"text":"Poor service!  It took 45 minutes for Kaylee the waitress to serve us two hamburgers.  My fiancee was in a hurry, but she just said \"sorry, guys!\".  Kaylee gave my fiancee his ice tea with out serving mine and didn't even say that my lemonade would be coming up.  After 45 minutes, I went to the manager, Amber, and asked her in front of the cooks and two other waiters if it's normal for two burgers to take 45 minutes!  I told them that I would never come back here again.  Amber said that the waitress would not come out on the patio again; but she came out three times.  Terrible service!!!"}
{"text":"If you want choices then you get them at Cheesecake Factory.   The service is always great but make sure you know what your getting because flavors varry from what you might expect.   For instance,  don't get a burger because it's not their specialty.  Salads and pricier dishes are.  If you not ready to spend $20 a person then you'd be better off going to Chipolte."}
{"text":"This place is very crowded. Waiting times are terrible. I can do grocery and cook a meal before they assign a table. It has always been a  bad experience every time I have gave it another shot. I will never go back here again. Not worth the aggravation given how many good restaurants are in neighborhood. When I got the table, the seat had food. They did not even have time to clean seat!"}
{"text":"Went over there last night with a party of 22.  Sat out on the patio.  it couldn't have been a nicer evening for a company dinner.  

Overall I would say the food was good.  The problem I have with this restaurant is actually their menu.  really, Mexican food, Italian food, American comfort food, Steaks, Fish, etc, etc etc.  It goes on and on.  Pick a style and go with it.

As I said it seems as though most everyone was pleased with their order but it was really confusing making a decision.  

Portion size unfortunately is solidly American style - WAY TO BIG!  I's no wonder we have a weight problem in the USA.

Our server did an excellent job of taking care of us, although the kitchen runners tried to serve us the party next ours food twice.

Overall I would go back but not the top of my list.

Oh and yes the Cheese Cakes all were excellent!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory seems to have traded quality for quantity to appeal to a different type of diner. I was very disappointed in the meal which was huge and tasteless. It reminded me of Mimi's, another restaurant that i will be sure not to frequent. The desert (cheesecake) was good."}
{"text":"Good, solid tasty food, well prepared in sizable amounts for reasonable prices. Waiters were friendly. Bartender poured big glasses of wine. Always a good option at home or travelling."}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory is porbably one of my favorite chain restaurants. I love the evalyns pasta and honestly everything i have ever ordered is great. My go to is the chicken Salad Sandwich which never fails me. 

This location however, I was a little disappointed with. My mother and I went on a Sunday afternoon after some shopping. We waited for what felt like forever once we were seated to even place our drink order. Though the waitress was super friendly, she just had bad service. We didnt see her again for maybe 20 minutes after handing us our drinks to take our food order. Then once the food runners brought the food order, she didnt stop by for another 15 minutes to refill drinks or at that point, just bring us the check. The whole experience just took too long and the service wasnt at all fast enough. Will continue to go to cheesecake but most likely not this location."}
{"text":"I got orange chicken and found a long hair and the cheese cake was so sugary if I ate it all I would have got diabetes.. No joke"}
{"text":"The Cheese cake Factory just opened up in Yordale Mall was just as good as the one I had tried in the States. The taste and portion is the same. The service was just as good. The manager was helpful. The server was cheerful, helpful .  There was always approximate an hour waiting time in the States. So I don't mind the 3 hours wait in Yordale Mall in Canada. Save the time driving and crossing the boarder. I went shopping when I wait. Sweet."}
{"text":"It was my birthday and I went here with my family. We were seated and waited about 10 minutes. A server told us she would be right with us. We waited about another 10 minutes. She brought bread to the table, didn't say a word, and left us again. She didn't bring us water, drinks, or take our order. After waiting about 25 minutes we got up and left. We go to this Cheesecake factory a few times a month and usually have good service, but because of this service it is highly unlikely we will ever return. There were many other servers that we could see were not busy, and not one of them came up when they could clearly see we had been waiting a long time. We then went across the street and received great service from True Food, as expected. Extremely disappointed in our experience at the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"The menu is large, so if you'v never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, I recommend looking through an online version of the menu before you go so you aren't as overwhelmed deciding what you'd like when you actually get there.

The service at this location is amazing.  The staff is extremely polite and very accommodating.  My beverage was never empty, and anything we needed, was provided (including plastic-ware for our to-go cheesecake).

For having such a large menu, I am surprised at how well they prepare each dish.  My table had the Fettuccine Alfredo (which needed a little pepper) and the teriyaki chicken (which was very delicious).  Right now there seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is available.  It is the best pumpkin cheesecake I have ever had!  I would also recommend their oreo cheesecake!

Just a warning: this restaurant is very dimly lit at night (makes for a romantic meal if you manage to get a booth).  I do not recommend eating here if your party includes someone with failing eyesight unless you bring a little light for them to use to see the menu."}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain, but I like it. It's a good go-to place for get-togethers. The menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so everyone can find something they like and leave full.

First off, I love the bread. I can make a meal out of that bread and butter any day of the week. And the cheesecake. How can you deny a slice of heaven? My latest fave is the red velvet cheesecake. I'm not a huge red velvet fan, but when you layer it with cheesecake and top it with cream cheese icing? Aweeesumm.

Other notable menu items: deep fried macaroni and cheese and the Chicken Madeira."}
{"text":"My first trip to The Cheesecake Factory. I was there for lunch on 8/4/15, when I told my server Laura S that the hamburger that I ordered well-done was raw in the middle, I got a lecture that I should have told her earlier so that she could have fixed it. Great, but this is the first time I saw you since I got my food. When was I supposed to tell you? No offer to fix it at that point. I ate the outside of the burger and left the center. When she brought the ticket I got another lecture from her that next time I come in if there is anything wrong I need to let her know. I let her know that I would not be returning."}
{"text":"dépaysant, copieux, service très soigné, à voir et à essayer ABSOLUMENT !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience, service was very attentive and on top of their game. We had a table of eight and they still managed to keep everyone's drinks filled and the bread basket full. We ordered the artichoke dip as an appetizer; a bit on the disappointing side. The chips were nice and crispy, but a little over-salted. I went with something I knew was good there...the Herb Encrusted Salmon with Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes (ha I write it like it's a move title). Anyways, it never fails to disappoint! They cooked the salmon medium rare (the way it SHOULD be cooked!) and the lemon butter sauce gave a nice sour edge to the entire meal. The decor is nice and laid back, although the lighting gets to be a bit too dim by the end of the night, at least in our section. Sometimes I feel like they crowd their menu a bit too much thus serving a lot of so-so dishes. They could benefit from a good spring cleaning of the menu :)"}
{"text":"Tasted like they heated up a frozen dinner for us. soggy."}
{"text":"First time there, the fact that just about everything is handmade in the kitchen is really nice for me and for people who have allergies and stuff, i got spaghetti  and meatballs. It was almost better than olive garden! It just needed a little more sauce but i mean it was way cheaper than olive garden, and you got more for your money! Plus nobody else has like a bajillion flavors of cheesecake. Oh btw get the s'mores its like a mouth bomb of flavorfulness"}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes to place a to go order on the phone, but Kevin the manager came to the rescue. Food was very good. Thanks to Kevin!"}
{"text":"My husband is allergic to carrots and informed the waitress. He ordered the hibachi steak which does not come with carrots. This should have been simple. When it arrived, they had replaced the asparagus...with carrots. We sent it back, of course, and I sat watching my food get cold and he sat staring at his empty glass (because the server completely stopped doing her job). When the dish arrived for the second time, it had absolutely no vegetables, so the dish was not even complete as presented on the menu--when we asked the manager about it, his response was, \"Well, they were so worried about getting the steak out.\" The result of all of this is that we left the steak on the bar and went to another restaurant for dinner.

I am usually a big fan of Cheesecake Factory--but the apathy tonight on the part of the staff and the management will keep me from going back to this location."}
{"text":"I have fallen completely in love with this place my food was delicious service exceptional and the place was gorgeous I was surprised by my daughter with a trip there for my birthday we came from Iowa city and it was well worth it, and can't wait to go back. 
My grand girls we very pleased also and we know it's hard to make a teen happy. The way she carried on about her steak was hilarious she even snap chatted about it. 
Everyone saw my Louisiana pasta and wished they copied my meal. It was so good even the 2nd day as I still had leftovers it was a nice helping of food I'm still thinking about it. My younger grandgirl loved the chocolate brownie and my cheesecake of course sealed the deal
Until we meet again"}
{"text":"Very good service here. Our server was Matthew and he was very attentive. He even swapped out my margarita for the lemon drop martini at no charge when I told him I thought the margarita had a funny aftertaste. The hubs and I were celebrating my birthday and the staff all sang \"Happy Birthday\" and made me feel special. We both enjoyed our lunch very much. Try the 'Evelyn's Favorite' pasta - it's vegetarian and extremely tasty."}
{"text":"I hate Cheesecake Factory with a passion. A MASSIVE menu is the absolute WORST concept a restaurant can front. It clearly shows since all 3 times I have been to this establishment the food has been unappetizing and just pathetic. Chicken Marsala was raw with a bland and watery sauce, I had 3 different kinds of noodles on the dish, how I have no clue. Any meat is not prepared to specification. Servers getting tables mixed up constantly. 

The issue is a massive menu, a massive kitchen, massive portions with a massive amount of employees just spells out a massive failure. Having a bible for a menu isn't appealing, it's just stupid. You sit there and spend 12 minutes going through everything and can barely see what you are reading if you choose to dine after dark. It hasn't failed yet in that each time I would find something different to try I would pretty much know something would be wrong with it. 

That's another thing, the \"ambiance lighting\". I suspect the reason for being that dark is so you can't see how bad your food looks when it arrives, so when you eat your meal there really isn't anything to look at and question. 

If anyone else is just the biggest fan of this chain, great, good for you. I'm not. The whole franchise just needs to disappear."}
{"text":"I did curbside service and they left out part of my order and got part of it wrong. I had to go back for the missing items after being told they would call me back- after being on hold for a while when I called about it I wasn't reassured that I would ever be called back by a manager. I didn't bother to get the other part of the order fixed since by then it was more trouble than it was worth.

The food was good but the quality of service can be improved, especially when it comes to putting to-go orders together."}
{"text":"Well, when my birthday plans fell apart, My roommate took me to the Cheesecake factory for dinner. 

We started with Calamari which was very good, the calamari was NOT rubbery , it was easy to chew , and was perfectly breaded. Completely delicious.

She ordered the Thai pasta ... and I ordered the Chicken Romano

Both were delicious. I loved the Chicken romano, the chicken was crispy and the pasta was delicious. There was so much that I could only eat half my dinner.

The Thai pasta.. I have to confess I kept stealing bites of my roommates dinner. The texture was good, the mix of flavors was just amazing ... I think I found a new favorite dish. I think my roommate was wishing she had ordered something else after I kept trying to distract her so I could steal bites.

We drank the Passion Iced Tea. It was really complimentary to the meal. 

Our server kept the glasses filled and even brought a huge glass of ice when ours melted too fast. 

Then we ordered CHEESECAKE...
She ordered the Tuxedo cheesecake . I tried a bite and the rich chocolate is definitely going to fit on my schedule from now on. It is perfectly chocolatey.  

I ordered The Caramel cheesecake I can't remember what the fancy schmancey name is .. but it was yummy in my tummy. 

They even sang happy birthday to me .. how rockin is that??"}
{"text":"I eat here every time I'm in Vegas.  It's truly a personal favorite.  The food is fantastic!  There's something on the menu for everyone.  For me, at The Cheesecake Factory, it tastes like somebody cares.  Love this location."}
{"text":"Love this place always good food!! And a good tip is the high top tables are seat yourself!!"}
{"text":"Was there on Sunday afternoon. Basically the food is overpriced and average at best. Friend of mine had the 'Orange chicken' and frankly I couldn't tell if it was chicken or fish. $2.95 for a glass of Coke? Are you kidding me? I really don't see the difference between this and any Olive Garden or Maccaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorites, can't go wrong with the chicken Madeira ( my favorite dish there). The chili was great too. One of the only places that no matter how full I am it is a must to get dessert."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people come here.  In fact when my whole party sat down, we all were trying to figure out why we ended up there.  The food just isn't good.  The salads were warm, the spinach dip so greasy, and the bread wasn't very soft.  It's just really not good for food, yet this place still stays in business.  It really isn't just this location either. 

The only reason I give this more than 1 star is that I LOVE cheesecake, and I enjoy the extremely decadent chocolate peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake.  However, I found out they are taking that off the menu because it's too rich.  But any place that has that much cheesecake gets an extra star."}
{"text":"What a disappointing trip to the cheesecake factory I have always been so satisfied with the meals here however on this occasion it was pretty pathetic.  The server seems to not care much about his job and just got done with a busy lunch he had no suggestions for us and could not keep our water full. We never saw the manager walking around to tell them how we felt about this experience.  In the future I will go to the superstition Springs location instead."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go get my cheesecake factory fix for the year and then I remembered why I only go once every 14 months, if that.  :( server was super awkward and not very personable...but I really liked their small plates menu, great way to try a few things, keep on budget and not stuff your face before it's time for a piece of their cheesecake."}
{"text":"I'm usually used to having good service and eating good food the cheesecake factory. But this was a whole other experience. We walked up to the front desk and no one greeted us for five minutes when they were standing right there. There were five people standing there and they were just talking the among themselves. After we got greeted they said it be a 15 minute wait so we waited 15 minutes and we sat down. We ordered avocado portobello and zucchini sticks they were so salty it wasn't even funny. So then our food came and my son had ordered a cheeseburger medium that was raw. My wife had ordered potstickers that were also very salty. We even got a cheese pizza that was salty. But my sons chicken nuggets were bland. Unless you're craving salty foods don't come here."}
{"text":"When I die, I hope it's because I was buried in a pile of the fried mac & cheese balls and I ate myself to death. No better way to go, imo. Also a fan of the Linda's Fudge Cake (I think that's what it's called?). Anyway, I don't know who Linda is but I hope she's living a great life."}
{"text":"ok the stars are for the cheese cake, it is really good i believe it was called upside down cheesecake..? yummy!.. cheese cake the only thing u need to go here for. Unless you starving, they give huge portions of dinner food, so be wary of what u get. I can say I would go back for a peach bellini! yummy!
     what brought me to right this review is the Bad food service, the waitresses and waiters were to busy, i'd say flirting, with each other. luckily we had a older respectable waitress. the food, how to put this.. the veggies looked great but tasted like charcoal! upon further inspection of \" where is that burnt smell coming from\" \"is it your food\" (snif snif) nope... bam it was the veggies that are served in a lil black tray. they were hard and so black on the bottom and gooey, some sort of morphing thing happening, a unbearable smell came out after moving the veggies around! its all we could smell. haven't been back since. so just smell your food upon arrival."}
{"text":"Okay, so I had to give at least one star because my food was amazing. However, my sisters was disgusting. She got an omelet, the egg was way over cooked and had what was like a rubbery skin and the potatoes were rock hard. We complained to the waitress who spoke to a manager and got it taken off the bill. Now I wouldn't hold that against them since they did provide a solution to the bad food. However, a manager never came over to talk to us about the situation or I would have mentioned the awful service we received. Twenty! Yes twenty  minutes after being seated our server finally greeted us and took our drink order. Since we were hungry I took that time to order an appetizer. Took another ten minutes to get a water and cup of coffee. Finally got to order. Waited yet another ten minutes for our appetizer that was brought by another tables server. She never came back to check how the app was and our drinks stayed empty for a long long time. Then our main food came again the server from another table brought it as ours was no where to be found. The table next to us commented that they just wanted to pay and leave. Finally she comes back and just says \"oh I'll get you more water.\" By the time we got that we were done with our meal. She never once asked how it was or my sister could have told her and not sat there hungry the whole time. But by the time she addressed the situation we were just annoyed and wanted to leave. We wanted dessert but couldn't justify being there any long or making our bill higher and then having to tip her any more money. For the prices they charge I expect good service and on this day we left angry and one of us still hungry. I'd never go back, but I will give a second chance as I can't imagine service is always that terrible. How does a manger after getting a complaint about food not go to the table and talk to the customer and apologize? Or how as a server who relies on tips do you ignore your tables. This whole experience took us an hour and forty five minutes, no excuse. You shouldn't have to wait twenty minutes to be greeted and places a drink order.  We just went here yesterday."}
{"text":"This is probably the one Cheesecake Factory I actually do like because the staff is super friendly and professional.  They don't take 2 hrs to come take your order and don't just brush you off.  When I go here it is usually for dinner with the family and or friends but there was a time I went in for lunch with just my kids as a treat for them and even then, the staff was super awesome.
Only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because the food is way too salty for my taste.  Might be okay for others since everyone eats differently but to me... way too salty."}
{"text":"Their Chinese Chicken Salad and Oreo Cheesecake are to die for!! I always get sat immediately and get really fast service at this location."}
{"text":"Good food with a calorie counter.
Portions from huge to \"shareable \" 
Lots of variety in their use of spices, sauces & mouthwatering 'bites'.
Inside can be a little noisy, but outside is lovely and cool.

My one tip ( and hence only 4*'s ) is beware that the food may not be hot enough early in the day. Not helped by cold plates either. 

I will always return, but not for an early lunch."}
{"text":"Been waiting to take the fiancee and son out for Mother's Day all week. This was our worst experience with any restaurant yet. Peter, our server, was awesome. The rest of our experience was a nightmare. Waited 30 minutes to be seated then over an hour for our food, which was cold and stale. Served my son hard, stale, and cold french fries. His chicken sliders were lukewarm and stale also. Our entrees came out 15 minutes after his and everything on our plates was lukewarm. We waited over an hour. Then the mgr comes over, introduces himself and states that he could have our food reheated. WTF? I don't want lukewarm stale food to be reheated. We just wanted fresh hot food. At this point we decided to leave. After ruining my fiancee's Mother's Day, they douche bag mgr still charged us for our drinks and appetizer. We will never revisit this location ever again and possibly never another cheesecake factory ever. Mother's Day only comes around once a year and ours was ruined by inconsiderate and unempathetic management. The one star is for Peter the server because he rocked."}
{"text":"skinny recipe & vanilla bean cheese cake is a must try:) right amount of portion unlike regular food."}
{"text":"Ordered their turkey avacado sandwich off their Skinnylicious menu. It may be a healthy menu but you think the waiter would have the common sense to alert a relatively large guy that he is ordering a sandwich the size of a Hawiian roll. $12 and I'd expect something bigger than a portion size for a toddler."}
{"text":"I had a great experience coming here. It's such a casual restaurant that also has its own elegant flair and atmosphere. 

Our waitress was very kind and helpful. I don't remember her name, but she always checked on us and was very patient with us when we couldn't decide on what to eat.

The food was definitely delicious. I'm usually not fond of the entrées when I come here because 1) they're supersized and when I use them as \"leftovers\", they get soggy and I can't eat them anyway, and 2) they're usually not the best tasting even at the restaurant. However, I decided to order only small plates / appetizers to satisfy myself. 

I ordered the crispy crab bites, which were decadent and had a lightly battered outside. The presentation was nice. It comes with six bites in a small skillet dish and a side of sauce and a lemon.

I shared the fresh basil, tomato and mozarella flatbread with my friend. She got the beet and goat cheese salad. Overall, we finished all of the food and we were still satisfied. The appetizers, in my opinion, taste 10000x better than the entrées. 

Now for the good stuff...the cheesecake. After several minutes of skimming through the endless list of various cheesecakes, I finally decided to go with Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which, in the words of the Cheesecake Factory gods, it is \"Layers of Moist Chocolate Cake, Chewy Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake.\" Ohhhhh yes...

My lovely waitress put this in a to-go box for me, and it was fresh the whole time I ate it. It was super sweet (which I love) and the coconut paired perfectly with the decadently rich chocolate and toasted pecans. And to top it all off, the brownie and cheesecake-y cream in the center made this cheesecake - eating experience all the more better for me.

I'm definitely coming here again, but this time, for the cheesecake only."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar because I was a solo diner.  Luckily for me, despite them only opening a week ago, I did not have to wait (because I didn't get a table).  At 4pm on their first Monday, the wait was estimated at 1.5-2 hours.  That's after the 20 min wait to get your name on the list.

No bread was offered.  Had to ask for that delicious brown one.  Not sure if they forgot to offer or they just don't if you're seated at the bar ordering dinner.

Told there was a 45 min wait for cheesecake so I ordered my cheesecake at the same time as my meal.  Got the Adam's peanut butter cup and it was divine.  It arrived when my meal did which was fine by me.

The waitress entered my meal incorrectly so it arrived wrong, and then they sent it back and forgot a key protein in the dish the second round.  Back it went again, and after 20 minutes it came out and was perfect.  Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  One of the tastiest things on that giant menu.  Order it with the \"cilantro rice\".  You won't be disappointed.

Servers were super helpful.  It was clear that they brought some from the states to help with opening week.  It was easy to tell who was new and who was experienced.  They were all very pleasant though.

Considering I was there for their first week, I was pretty happy with the overall experience.  Because they have so many other restaurants in the states, I only offer a little leniency for not having things running a little smoother.  Th pure volume of people is one thing, but once the restaurant is full, it's like any other full Cheesecake Factory restaurant in the states... and they should be prepared for the crowd and ensure their new staff are up to par.  First Canadian operation though, so I do acknowledge the learning curve."}
{"text":"Food is always good service has its ups and downs try to avoid going 5-7 pm always super busy in there and takes about 30-40 mins to be seated"}
{"text":"Love love love this place... Mike Lopez is the best waiter. We come at least once a day"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and do not come here. Do not waste your time and money. Not worth either. 

Food is mediocre at best and I've been to other locations and they ALWAYS fell short. The free bread  and water was the only thing good. But anyways, this experience was by far one of the worst. 

I came to celebrate my graduation with my bf and he has never been to The Cheesecake Factory. I kinda warned him that it wouldn't be the best food and that everything was overpriced but I just wanted him to experience it and the cheesecake is usually pretty good (as one would hope right).

 He ordered a burger well-done and it came out extremely pink inside but somehow the outside of the patty was incredibly charred. I ordered the jambalaya with pasta and the pasta was incredibly overcooked. As I pulled on the noodles they stuck together and tore apart. I had a couple bites and it was mush. The protien was good, the chicken and shrimp but the pasta was unpalatable. 

I am just so disappointed about the dining experience. Didn't come in expecting much but didn't expect it to be THAT bad. The manager was completely cooperative and even said straight up that he can tell we weren't enjoying our experience. He and the waitress insisted they could have the food redone but I just wanted to leave!!

He ended up comping us for the two entrees. I was not gonna pay $20 for a a plate of mush noodles and my bfs  $15 burger that was almost raw inside. Even the appetizer we got was not worth $6. Lol truffle bacon cheese sticks. Basically a sandwich with a thin peice of cheese and bacon cut up into 5 pieces. 

Still left a tip. Not a great one but still a tip nonetheless. Overall, was a complete waste of time and I'm not one to complain like that but i was so disappointed I wanted to just get up and leave. Wish I would have taken a picture but I didn't even think to. Like I said, the manager was very kind about the whole situation, so props to him!

How The Cheesecake Factory is still in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service every time we go!! Ambience is so good and I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Came in to Vegas for business. Andrew was such a great waiter. He made sure I was taken care of, very genuine guy. Food came out fairly quick and was great! I will definitely be coming back here since I come out to Vegas once a month. Chopped salad, no corn sub blue cheese for goat cheese, and sweet potatoe fries! Do it!"}
{"text":"A nice date night visit to Cheesecake Factory at the District on Saturday.  Only waited 15 minutes to get seated.  On a Saturday night-not too shabby.  The waitress was pleasant and very attentive.  We ordered the crab balls and they were so good along with the bread I was already getting full. LOL  For dinner I had went all out for probably the most fattening thing and got the fettuccini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes.  My BF got his normal - orange chicken.  His seemed too sweet for me but he liked it.  We both LOVED mine.  Amazing!  I think he ate at least a third of mine. haha  We ordered the pumpkin cheesecake to go and it was fabulous of course.  Both were way more than enough.  Maybe next time we will share the fettuccini! ;)

At the end of the meal we both thought \"why dont we come here for often?\"  The prices are good, the ambiance is ok-maybe a little loud, but the food is fantastic!  Big fan!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant in about 10 years. My Mom wanted to go for her birthday so off we went today. Prices are high keeping in line with other restaurants that offer this type of fare. Food is delicious and the cheesecakes are wonderful. The issue came with the service. My Dad is in a wheelchair and when we were leaving, 3 people were standing behind the hostess stand and said goodbye but not one came over to help us with the double doors upon exit. Poor form. The restaurant was not busy but we were there for a solid 2 hours because of the wait time for the server, waiting for food, and finally waiting over 1/2 hour for 3 slices of cheesecake! I finally tracked the server down and asked her how long does it take to cut cheesecake? Then they arrived within the next 10 minutes. One server came to our table to deliver the food and by accident, managed to tip my Dad's water glass into his lap and all over the table where it ran over to spill on my Mom as well. It was cleaned up quickly but I would have thought we would have seen a manager concerning the issue. Nothing. Folks, your food is excellent but your service leaves a lot to be desired. If you decide to go, leave yourself lots of time..."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Cheesecake. My favorite dish is the Chicken Picatta with a extra side of the sauce with a ice cold cup of their passion ice tea. Man it just makes my mouth water thinking about it. 

I'm so stuff after eating, I barely have no room for dessert but that never stops me from ordering a piece to take home for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Service seems to be getting better. But, the hostess told me a one hour wait unless I sat at the bar. When I resisted, a table was found. Remember, cheesecake factory, take care of your single guests."}
{"text":"Food is always good, service can vary...  I actually really enjoy the mexican dishes here, even though it's not exactly a Mexican restauarant.  If there were \"half stars\", I would probably say 3.5 out of 5, but since they have cheescake, we'll round up :)"}
{"text":"Long wait but was worth it. Had fetticini Alfredo and strawberry smoothie. It was all good. Worth the time and cash."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have been here to eat. I must say that it was very disappointing. Their soda machine broke, service was slow and for the first time the food was nothing special. 

You won't see me eating there any time soon."}
{"text":"Have been to this Cheesecake factory several times and the food is always AMAZING. Usually it's a quick wait but this last time was very long despite the 30 minute predicted wait. They could really benefit from some sort of paging system. It would be nice to be able to look at shops and while you are waiting for the unpredictable time. Once we got in it took a bit to get waited on but they were clearly understaffed. Still would recommend as their food is so consistently good with generous portions great for sharing."}
{"text":"Love your cheesecake and your variety of fun drinks and dishes but WHY, WHY, WHY did you have to take Caramel Chicken off the menu????? It was the best entree and now I'm left to try and re-create it (fail horribly) at home! Tearz.

If you love a variety of food with spot on flavor or if you just have an insatiable sweet tooth go to Cheesecake Factory. Personally, I love their thai chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. 

Sadly, I will rarely go here except for cheesecake because of the recent caramel chicken loss. Let me tell you that was a big loss!!"}
{"text":"Really bad carry out. Salad not so fresh, quesadilla mediocre. Blah blah blah. Do yourself a favor and do dessert here but dinner someplace else."}
{"text":"This location is terrible: from service and appearance to menu and food, there is honestly nothing that garners a \"star\" on this review. Unfortunately Yelp doesn't give me that option. 

Sounds harsh, I know. So let me break this down and hopefully someone would care enough to read the reviews and strive for improvement. 

Let's start with the host station; you know, the first impression of any business. Well, in this case we get a snotty girl who just doesn't give a f*ck. As if we have inconvenienced her to ask for a seat. Also she has this habit of setting off the wait list buzzer before anyone is ready to take us to our table. How perplexing... 

When we've finally managed to reach a table, we were extremely concerned by the bits of left over food stuck on all the silverwares. I assumed all the tables were set by actual human beings so I was a bit insulted by the level of dirtiness on my table. I mean, would THEY eat off of those greasy plates and forks?? 

On to the menu now: the menu is a novel. You can basically find every dish imaginable, from japanese to thai to mexican to irish to italian to american and beyond! And what's up with all the ads on ever page?? Note: allow for extra time when dining at CCF because the servers won't come back to take your order for at least 30 min. after you're seated, and trust me you'll need that much time to look through the plethora of choices offered. 

As for the food, lol.... First of all don't bother ordering anything for your kids on the kids menu; they're all watered down with milk. The soupiness and blandness of my daughter's mac n cheese made any kraft instant boxes look gourmet. Then came the gigantic entrees that would feed an entire third-world country village. Big portions are nice, but what's the sense in stuffing my face with raw pasta, salt, and grease? Paired with previous left over food bits stuck on my forks? No thank you. Mind you, prices per entree averages at $19.

So there. I will take my $100 and put it in any local restaurant that takes pride in their menu and cares about my patronage."}
{"text":"Service was great
Food was disappointing the crab bits we tasteless and over cooked
The mango cheese cake was good as well
Over all it was ok
And expensive
35.00 per plate"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with my son before he goes off to college.  Kyle was our server and was very attentive.  We started with the calamari which was crisp, hot and delicious.  My son got the salad with seared tuna, and I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps.  I had a special request for a different sauce, and it came just like I ordered it.  We finished off with a piece of salted caramel cheesecake which was amazing.  The GM even visited our table, and he was extremely friendly and professional.  We will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"Expected long lines but we were surprisingly seated within 15 minutes.  Instead of pagers, they just tell you to wait near the bakery behind the hostess.  Our server was attentive and the food was great.  I love Cheesecake Factory but I typically never go to this location because there are so many other places to try out in Vegas.  Since I had 2 picky teens with me, I figured we could please all palates here and have something to do afterwards in the Forum Shoppes."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day brunch 

Just 2 of us

Sat down. No wait at 1030am. 

Then no server. Amazing how like 20-30 people walk by without acknowledging us. 

Crazy thing is ive been here before and this happens often. It consistently sucks here. 

Finally ordered. What's the point. Our server never put in our order then went to take a huge tables order. We waited. No drinks came. Not even a water. 

Manager doesn't even notice. 

We walk out. The girl who sat us says thanks for coming. Get a brain. You just sat us 30 min prior and no one came to help us. 

This place is on auto pilot and it's crashing!"}
{"text":"I pretty much die every time I come here. I've never had a bad meal. Even when they're swamped with people the service is still pretty good."}
{"text":"Several weeks ago, our family had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory on Rampart. It is a familiar place that we can go because of the variety of foods. No one in the family can go wrong with the amount of choices they offer, and of course, there is cheesecake for dessert! 

Our waiter took an extraordinarily long time to take our drink order & to bring bread & butter. After we gave him the drink order, we still waited an extraordinarily long time just to get drinks, and still had to remind him of a beer that we ordered. When salad came, there was a toothpick in my son's salad. Had the toothpick got into his mouth, he could have choked, cut his mouth, or any number of things. One of the side dishes we ordered didn't come with our order & arrived much later. Overall, it was one of the worst experiences I have had at The Cheesecake Factory. Be forewarned about this location. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite places to eat. Big portions and the food is delicious. So much to choose from. Try the shrimp scampi, chicken madeira (ask for pasta instead of mashed potatoes),chicken picatte, shrimp po boy, thai lettuce wraps, cashew chicken, miso salmon, Cajun rib eye steak and calamari. The hits just keep on coming! These are just a few of the dishes that I have experienced. The service has always been consistently good. Do not forget the cheesecake and other sinful desserts. Deelish!

If you have never eaten here before. Trust me, you will be a fan."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and enjoyed their tortilla soup. The soup was really good. I cam here with a group of 6 and service was pretty good. Everyone's food looks good, I know they are known for their cheesecake but I didn't get any. Will be going back to try."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Got the ribeye and banana cream cheesecake for dessert. CCF doing it right. #Cheesecake"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go back to this place as long as one of their servers still works there...... So rude and disrespectful! I contacted the corporate office to file a complaint. Absolutely NO ONE deserves to be treated the way I did on today."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Super long wait for our food! Food was good, but prices are outrageous for what you get. Server acted like she was on something, and took forever to bring us anything. They charged me $7.95 for a piece, which looks like half a piece of Tiramisu. Very disappointed! We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy and have always enjoyed the cheesecake factory. They have never gotten it wrong with the vast menu and so many different dishes to choose from.
 I really try to only eat here every now and then especially since so many of the menu items are so full of calories and sodium. Have always had great service and friendly, knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"I had Dan as a waiter (call him David if you don't like him). He was amazing and went above and beyond in serving us. Whenever you visit this location you MUST request fruity Dan. Just like he was a man of his word I'm a man of mine. Love you Dan"}
{"text":"Ordered a well done classic burger  made it clear when I ordered I wanted it well done. I said actually very well done. Server said no problem.  Not even close to well done. Told her about. No refund no offer to redo it. Very poor experience will not return"}
{"text":"This was our first time to a Cheesecake Factory.  We could understand why it is a favorite among many.  We parked on the street a couple of blocks from the restaurant.  It is $1/hour on the street.  I'm not sure how much it is in the parking garage.  We went on a January Saturday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, we were seated right away. Our waitress was attentive.  The selection of food available is incredible and the portions are generous.  I had the dynamite shrimp, lunch herb crusted salmon and the mango key lime cheesecake.  Hubby had the wings and the mushroom burger with a side salad.  We loved our food.  The dynamite shrimp was deep fried and the sauce came on the side.  I'm not sure what the dinner portion would have been for the herb crusted salmon but the lunch portion was pretty big already.  It came with about five skinny asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The cheesecake....YUM!  It was really good.  Based on the quality of the food and the selection, I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Wow--management here needs a run on \"Hell's Kitchen\". We decided to eat here because we had things to do at the mall, and will NEVER return. I've been to the Scottsdale Cheesecake Factory several times, but this was a horrible experience. From meals not coming out simultaneously (how difficult is it to have two meals arrive together?), to orders being wrong, to being told the manager WASN'T interested in helping us with our complaints until we pushed it--just ridiculously bad customer service and a bad dining experience. We were so miffed we didn't even want to stay for the piece of cheesecake that we came in for!"}
{"text":"Although it is busy, I find that the staff is prompt when finding seating.  The food is phenomenal, the restaurant is clean, nice background music, over all I would say this is the best cheese cake factory I have yet to visit!"}
{"text":"I work for a very large corporate company and can't stress enough on how important it is to give clients a great customer experience.  It is employees like the ones that work for this location, that can make people think twice before coming back.  Our server was very incompetent.  He was by far the worst server i have ever had.  The server neglected to service our table.  He completely forgot about us. We had to ask the manager for our tab and get desert from the \"to go\" register.  The manager was less than concerned.  All she said was a very insincere SORRY. I will make sure to let everyone i know that this location needs help on the service side. As for the chefs, the food is always great."}
{"text":"I love their service I give them 5 stars their food is very good but their desserts are delicious. Favorite has to be the milkshakes, and the fish. We do enjoy coming here when we come to visit Arizona. Recommended by a big eater."}
{"text":"This is a great Cheesecake Factory, pretty much all of them are  great but this location is particularly nice. The staff is friendly and experienced. I would say I average coming to this restaurant three times a month. If she is working we try to sit in Jessica's section, she always takes care of us! We also do take-out often and the service is equally impressive. Like I said above, this is a great location. HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I suggest going on a weekday as soon as it opens. We went on a Monday around noon, got the buzzer upon entrance, and waited about an hour until we were seated. The service was great! We only ordered cheesecakes, which came out to be around $10 a slice (which isn't too bad considering the fact that cafe cheesecakes are $7-8 a slice). Lots of options!!! We had the Hershey and Reese cheesecakes. They were extremely filling! I'll definitely be returning for more cake."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my foods and services! We came in at 1:50 pm and waited for 15 mins just to order our drinks!!! And we didn't get our food till 1 hour later....and waited for 40mins for him to stop by so I can request for our check! This is ridiculous!!!!!! If I can give negative stars! I would!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, beautiful atmosphere and wonderful service. The parking was congested at 5:00, but there is free valet. The only complaint is that the food wasn't quite as good as the location I usually frequent, but to be fair, I was only here once."}
{"text":"Great place for different kinds of food.  food was so pretty we took pictures :)  Great food and friendly service.  Haven't had room for the cheesecake yet."}
{"text":"I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasts and it was delicious as usual. Being from Louisiana this dish lives up to its name (considering this is a chain restaurant).  With its large portion size, this dish can definitely be shared if you aren't super hungry.  I definitely recommend the sweet corn tamales for an appetizer. Parking here can get a little complicated but the staff and service more than makes up for any parking inconvenience."}
{"text":"Lunched here on June 4, 2013

Fried Mac & Cheese is TO DIE FOR.  I can have that and their complimentary bread and call it lunch. Mmmmm!!!  Didn't get any cheesecake this time... :(

Son had the calamari and loved it. Came with some fried mini octopus but he didn't eat those. LOL"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout(at 430)and the girl at the dessert counter was extremely rude. Acted like everything was a bother to her. Had to re-ask for items we asked to be ordered the first time. Food was great but customer service was terrible."}

{"text":"Love this place for special occasions. Good service, pleasant atmosphere and everything from drinks to fancy meal to delicious cheese cake. Only down fall is the cost."}
{"text":"I finally braved the lineup at the Cheesecake Factory in Toronto and actually didn't have to wait that long at all! To be fair, it was 4PM on a weekday but I'm glad my party of 5 were able to snag a cosy booth within 15mins. The food here is GREAT but the portion sizes are wayyy too big for the average human, so I highly recommend ordering appetizers instead of an entree or sharing - gotta leave room for dessert! The selection is impressive and there truly is soemthing for every taste palette here with unorthodox options such as tiramisu and keylime cheesecakes being offered. Staff here are always on the move and with the place packed expect to wait a bit to get your belly full."}
{"text":"I took my 5 yr old granddaughter to the Superstition Springs location tonight between 5:30 & 6pm, it was naturally busy for a Friday eve. We had to wait about 20 mins, which was ok. The ambiance was nice, the lighting was pretty dark, but ok. I ordered the kids mini burgers & FF for my lil girl & from the lite menu, the chix salad sand,w/ a small salad for myself. Our server was just ok. Took about 20 mins to get our food. I had 2 bites of my salad, which was ok, bunch of nice greens, 1 tomato wedge & 1 thin slice of cucumber, Then I took 1 bite of my sandwich, that looked nice & I bit into something sharp & hard, shocked me, I just spit it out, when I look it was a piece of wood from 1 of those large toothpicks they put in sandwiches, I pulled out the 1 in the half I picked up, well I guess the kitchen had put 1 in before which broke & they didnt remove all of it, a piece about 1 1/4 inch, I was so upset. When I bit into that wood it hurt my tooth & my gum.

At the same time my lil granddaughter said, something is wrong with my burg, when I looked the 2 inch in diameter very thin burg was RAW inside & the lil roll was super soggy, I looked & the 2nd 1 was the same way! Now I'm pissed!!!! I called for our server right away & said I need a manager now, He happened to be walking by. Well I first told him about her lil burgers being RAW, then my sandwich having a big piece of toothpick in it. He started making excuses & said I'll have them hurry & make new food for both of you, I said NO, dont hurry take the time to cook the damn burgers & I was so turned off I didnt want anything at all!!!! Then they were kissing my ass!! I told them to just bring my lil granddaughter her burgers fully cooked, she was hungry! I would never feed her raw meat, thats just crazy!! 

They kept coming over & by this time I just wanted them to leave us alone. He said the cook was sorry, he did break the 1st toothpick & he didnt THINK to remove it?? Thats just not right. They came back shortly with her lil burgers the meat was cooked, I think,it was so dark, but the rolls AGAIN soggy, OMG, are they just stupid!!

She finally got her lil burgers. What a mess. I will never go there again to spend my money!!! They took care of our check, as they should have!! You just never know what happens to your food, were at their mercy!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a good family dinner experience, and it was good enough. I sat down, took my order, but it took forever! I honestly couldn't believe that it took 45 minutes to prepare my meal. The food was pretty decent, but the atmosphere was astonishing. I wouldn't really fully recommend this place to anyone, but it isn't bad!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake itself is always amazing and the food is good. Server was very nice but very busy with 6 tables it was hard for quick service. I had dirty silverware wrapped in my napkin which turned me off right away. Nothing more disgusting then seeing someone else's food on your utensils. 

I probably won't go back to this location because of the dirty silverware but will visit the Boca Park location to get some cheesecake for sure."}
{"text":"CheesecakeFactory! What the hell was that? Do you also serve dishes like these to your guests in the restaurants? I ordered the white chicken chili with white rice. I had a half tablespoon of rice?! There was no salsa. 15 dollars for a dinner which hadn't been enough for a little kid. My husband had the teriyaki chicken. Also no comment on that. On his his plate was the rice for both of us :D but unfortunately no sauce at all. What you see on the plate is the good old Heinz barbecue sauce :D:D The only reason we would go back there is for the cheesecake but nothing else."}
{"text":"Always pretty good service. They have a very large menu with a lot of variety. Something for everyone. We've come for breakfast items as well as dinner. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming to Cheesecake Factory for there menu. There's something for everyone! Big wide variety of food. Food came out at a timely matter. Our server was friendly. We sat in the bar and ordered drinks while we waited for our table. We will be back!"}

{"text":"I went here for my birthday and the service and food were great! I was upset because I walked away for a moment and when I came back my boxed up food had been thrown away. However I spoke with the manager and she was extremely nice and made me a whole new meal, and it seemed like she gave me more food than I had in the first place. Definitely going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some cheesecake to go and found the service I received to be very slow and unorganized.  Especially considering there was no line in front of me when I arrived yet I still had to wait 7 minutes just to place my order."}
{"text":"Lined up for 1.5hour to get the pager to try out the new cheesecake factory at Yorkdale. The lineup was quite the experience, they had security escort us through different segments of the line throughout the mall. After we finally got to the pager, the wait was about 30mins more.

Food:
I really enjoyed the food in terms of taste and portion size. Ordered the chicken Bellagio and 
the combination with pasta was good. Chicken was nice and crispy, sauce was good balance of flavour and creaminess. 

I ordered dulce de leche cheesecake and celebration cheesecake. Celebration was Allright, nothing special since it has too much of the add ons which take away from it. Dulce de leche is good!

Atmosphere:
The atmosphere and service was great. Very accommodating and attentive. They advised us that there was a long wait for cheesecake and to choose early and order it at the same time as the entree. Although I changed my mind halfway through the meal, they were still able to accommodate with getting it to me in a reasonable time frame after my meal. 

I wish there wasn't such a long wait for a table so that I can visit again more."}
{"text":"The lemonade was AWESOME!! There's sugar on the rim! :) 

The food was good, I had the lousiana inspired dish, I can't remember the exact name. For dessert, I had the Strawberry Cheesecake. It was sooo yummy and AWESOMENESS!! :D 

The service was good, he kept checking up on us. The only thing we didn't like was the tea. My cousin ordered regular iced tea and got passion-peach tea and it was NOT good!! *blech* 

But other than that, it was a great place and I'd definatly go back!"}
{"text":"I've had one of my best dining experiences here!! I went with some friends one night and we had a grand old time! We laughed and had the cutest waiter EVER! The food was awesome! but the skinny minies I had with me couldn't finish their food! Ugh, nothing is more of a turn off than to see a girl who weighs 80 pounds soaking wet swearing she can't have another bite! 

Anyway I digress!

I went another night another friend of mine. Him and I had an awesome time! We arrived and a table opened up quickly. We sat and were served well. Our waiter was very attentative, my friend thinks he hit on him though... but we always fight about which server is hitting on who! lol! 

I ordered a SMALL cesar salad because my friend ordered a small soup. And they brought out this HUGE platter of salad! and the cesar dressing was so strong I couldn't eat it! I tried!! Really I did! it was like... stinging me! ouch! :'( 

But I did order the chinese beef dish and that was INCREDIBLE! He ordered... hmmmm... I don't rememeber... but it must have been good he didn't complain. lol. We laughed and joked and talked and ate. We had too much fun. By the end of our meal he orded an pineapple upside down cheesecake! oh it was DEVINE!!!! I have never, EVER had a more better cheesecake ever! I will absolutely come back! 

Our experience was amazing. simply amazing."}
{"text":"Knowing all too well this is chain eatery, this was still a disappointing experience. The single star was for our kind but goofy waiter. Let's begin with the drinks. All WAY overpriced and of poor quality. Word to the wise (if you miss happy hour), best to stick to water or beer in a place of this echelon. The apps are a disaster. Egg roll sampler was a cruel joke of deep fried baby food with 4 small petri dishes of insulting dipping sauces. The cheese quesadilla was a slap in the face, any 5 year old can make a better version... unless of course,, you like your soggy $12 quesadilla  served with a small dollop of browned guacamole (clearly plated at least 2 hours prior). Entrees were all overpriced and lackluster. Stay away from their \"Italian\" food. They cant even cook pasta properly. In a nutshell, everything is overpriced and poorly prepared. It's a perfect place to take someone you hate, like a funny uncle or a tedious in-law. Most fast food chains offer better tasting food options. This place is a type of hell reserved for your worst enemies. Plus, I got the runs."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried it for the very first time the food was amazing and the waiter James was amazing as well we will be going back there again and hopefully I can get James again his service was by far the best I have had in a long time so thank you James"}

{"text":"This is a cheap spot we visit all the time when in Las Vegas...we usually visit Las Vegas for spring break since my son was 9years old....but now that he is in college he do different things for spring break.  The food is fool proof...I order 1 of 2 items the Louisiana chicken pasta or the Jerk shrimp...both are really good in my opinion...our last visit we had the most amazing waiter and the best margarita!"}
{"text":"Recently ate here, great service. I wish I could remember my server. We were there late Tuesday. Our server was female. She gave us a good tip about the salted caramel cheese cake; it was dope. They have the best deserts and drinks."}
{"text":"After church, came to the District. We took the kids to the big carousel so that they could ride. The kids had a blast, shortly after, we walked around in the Whole Food market, and came to Cheesecake Factory. We had a little wait, but it was well worth it. We were seated as quickly as possible. The waiter was awesome. My son had a dish that consisted of meatloaf, mash potatoes, and a soup. I had a seafood sandwich dish that included the sandwich, salad, and a soup. Everything was fantastic. One of my nephews ordered the corn dogs and fries of the kiddies meal. My other nephew had kids pizza and kids Mac and cheese. My mom had a soup and salad dish. And my dad had an appetizer as his dish. The bill for the six of us came out to be about $87. We had a great time eating, talking, and taking in the ambient environment."}
{"text":"So I went to this Cheesecake Factory last night not knowing what to expect except for cheesecakes... I had a good time sitting around with some of the folks from work have a couple of glasses of wine, a shot of something (forgot the name), a sprite, appetizers, and of course the cheesecake. My friend ordered the tuxedo cheesecake and we shared.. It was good. For the appetizers, we ate nachos and chips (platter size) and other stuff. One of the girls ordered personal pansize pizzas for her grandbabies. We were thinking that they were maybe four pieces like Pizza Hut...Boy were we wrong. It was more like ten pieces. One of the kids had pepperoni and the other had a cheese pizza. Thanks, ladies."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go for lunch. The avocado egg rolls are amazing!"}
{"text":"Boca park store was good a little disappointing as we ordered spinach dip and the salsa that came with it was frozen!! As our entree was served there was a hair on the inside of the sandwich!  Remember the lighting in there in dim! It was replaced with another dish but took longer than expected .  Pet peeve is having dirty dishes sit on the end of the table and no one picks them up, which happened a few times!!  For the money that was spent this was disappointing.  On a up note the food was very good."}
{"text":"They have a wonderful selection for gluten free as well as traditional food.  They even offer a couple cheesecake delights gluten free . Thank you guys !!!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is and will probably always be one of my favorite restaurants. Especially since we don't have one close, it's a must when we travel. I wish I remember the specifics of what we had, I had some sort of Thai Salmon and my boyfriend had a shrimp and steak combo of some sort with mashed potatoes. We both loved everything. It was his first time visiting. Love the atmosphere, the staff, service, and food! Of course we both had to take cheesecake home. He had dulce de leche and I have pumpkin pecan, both fantastic."}
{"text":"Love,love love great place to eat at obviously, because it never fails always crowded.  But other than that the food is spectacular, the staff are friendly and seems to be un bother by the pack house, which indicates they very professional and use to it and able to handle it. Food melts in your mouth my go to place when I just need some good, good food."}
{"text":"Got take out since the restaurant was very busy on Saturday night.  Ordered a burger with salad.  Refrigerated the salad within 10-15 minutes after picking it up to eat the next day and ate the burger, which was fine even if it was cooked medium rather than the well-done requested.  After eating the salad the next evening, I had diarrhea and vomiting a few hours after eating until the next morning. I obviously won't be back."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory everywhere so the issue wasn't with the food.
Service was cool! Of course when the tip was received, the service got OFF THE CHARTS AMAZING while we were leaving.

I usually go to the Summerlin location, but after a day at the outlet with friends,and not knowing there was a cheesecake there, we tried it out.
I PERSONALLY won't be going back for the simple fact that there were flies above our table. When we expressed it to our server, he \"justified\" the flies as being \"bar flies\"... Can you say, still grossed the f**% out? 
Didn't offer to move us or anything.(there were 6 of us)

I understand the fruits and sugars and such attract buggies  but I work in the industry as well and we do not have that issue...( btw there were no flies or gnats by the bar)
Just saying."}
{"text":"Amazingly long menu, tons of items but yet the vast majority of it doesn't really interest me.  High quality food, and well prepared but am I every really saying \"oh, I gotta go to the cheesecake factory tonight\"?  No, not really. But at the same time I'd never really say no to going to the cheesecake factory, you're going to get a good well prepared meal there.

{"text":"I went here with my family for dinner last night, and we did not have a pleasant dining experience, mostly due to the longer than advised wait time.

We put our name on the waitlist at 6:15 PM, and were quoted a 55-70 minute wait.  The hostess told us to check back in \"an hour\" to see where we were on the list.  Shouldn't we have been quoted 60-70 minutes instead of 55-70 minutes?  We did as told, and were advised to check back in 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, they told us our table would be ready \"any minute\".  It took 10 more minutes for our buzzer to go off, and 10 minutes after that to actually be escorted to our table.  I remember being seated at 8PM (1 hour and 45 minutes after we put our name on the list).

I understand this location was especially busy, but I would appreciate honest information so that we may best plan our evening.

In addition, the food took long to be brought out.  My mother ordered a French Country Salad, and it did not contain asparagus as advertised.  We were sent home with a boxed salad.  The food we ordered did taste very good, the portions were huge, and the waitress was very cordial.  I wish we were not stuffed on bread (since we were hungry for waiting for much longer than expected), so that we may have enjoyed our meals a bit more.

I remember initially being interested in purchasing a gift card with a stipulation of returning at a later date to claim your reward (a slice of cheesecake).  However, I decided against that, because I am not sure I will return."}
{"text":"Love this place food is always great. Served hot fresh and in a timely manner. Most times service is great and the wait is never too long. If you do come here ask for the tamale cakes appetizers they are absolutely drop dead delicious! Its a bit pricey but once you try it youll forget that it costed $10.95. Lol"}
{"text":"Last night, I had a 3 hour wait. I would never, ever wait three hours to eat anywhere were it not my granddaughter's birthday wish to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for her birthday.

Upon getting \"beeped\" I approached the front counter where I was confronted with YOUR POLICY that made YOUR HOSTESS RUDE. She informed me that \"policy\" said we could not be seated because all 6 of us were not there. Two were at the bar closing out our check and one was in the mall because as a 73 year old, he needed to sit. YOU do not have anywhere near the seating needed for waiting guests.

Are you kidding? Do you really expect everyone to be there immediately upon beeping after three long hours? My lord, I wonder why the fire marshals have not ordered you to clear the doorway of scores of people waiting to be seated. Your food staff had huge difficulty navigating the immense crowd. Think guest safety. When Saturday night crowds are big and it is 10 degrees outside, perhaps you can isolate a better waiting area.

Everything about The Cheesecake Factory gets high marks but not your corporate policies or customer accommodation  (therefore the 2 stars as an average for food vs. \"policy\"). It is a very selfish attitude that causes customer-staff friction and it is needless. Yes, it spoiled our meals and left a sour taste that even you cheesecake can not remove."}
{"text":"not bad, long wait.... floor is slippery. Staff is very friendly... great Food"}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory. So of course, when I got homesick this was a great place to go! It was a busy Saturday night at Caesar's but we were able to be seated within 15min! Very impressed :) Service was great...unfortunately, I decided to try something different than my usual Chinese chicken salad & fried macaroni and cheese balls. Slightly disappointed. I definitely don't recommend their cream of chicken soup. Just a lil too watery and too many tomatoes floating around for my liking. 

BUT, the vanilla bean cheesecake was ah-mazing. Their slices are gigantic so we had it split and the waitress was even nice enough to bring it on two separate plates (*kudos* to good service*). 

So I think I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a million times (ok maybe not but...) and I've [so far] concluded the following:

Yay: Chinese Chicken Salad, Fried Macaroni Balls, Meat Loaf, Pot Stickers, Club Sandwich, Terriyaki Steak, Pomegranate Margarita, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.

Nay: Cream of Chicken Soup."}
{"text":"This was a total disappointment in customer service. We wanted to treat our daughter to a special night for her sweet 16 birthday. Our waiter seemed to be rushed creating a very uncomfortable atmosphere. The thought of begging our server for more bread and water as he rushed passed our table. Makes me wish we would have stayed home in the comfort of our own home for this very special event. When our food finally arrived after what seemed like a hour I could not help take notice the restaurant was nearly empty making me wonder why our service was so uncalled for. Our server brought our food out he again apparently was in a hurry since he handed me a very hot plate I nearly dropped it on the table! When I expressed the plate was hot he did not comment and rushed off! Don't be fooled by the fancy exterior I would much rather stay home."}
{"text":"Look - I've been to this Cheesecake Factory several times and have always had great service and the food has been good.  No complaints there.  

What I am here to complain about is their system for reservations.  My birthday is tomorrow, and my plan was to call and make a reservation for 8 people on a Friday at 6 PM.  I called, and was informed that \"they don't take reservations after 4 PM.\"  They then suggested that one person from our party get to the mall approximately an HOUR TO AN HOUR AND A HALF early, get a buzzer, shop, and then have the rest of the party arrive?  

I'm sorry, but this policy is absolute garbage.  It's a busy place, and I was trying to plan ahead for a relatively large group.  But NOPE!  Now I have to show up super early for my own birthday dinner and wait for a damn table because they don't take reservations - but only after 4 PM.  I've never been more confused.  

Basically, I'll be there tomorrow at 5 for a 6 PM dinner.  If I get turned away because my entire party isn't yet at the restaurant, you can BELIEVE I am going to complain about it in every way I can."}
{"text":"I can never give Cheesecake Factory a 5-star until they change their facility design (the hellish din when they are busy is what keeps me away most of the time.)  But I spotted an opportunity to dine al-fresco here at their South Side location and took full advantage.

What we found so great was that CF has implemented a \"skinnylicious menu\", and it surely is skinnylicious.  We loved our meals, they were tasty and low in calories (because low in carbs, IMO)  Hats off to you guys, I'll be visiting again whenever you're not busy or I can dine outside of your horrible echo-chamber dining rooms!"}

The wait was short, the food was great (I only had calamari but it was the best I've had in a long time and I loved their mint iced-tea!).. above all the service was absolutely the best! Thank you David and thank you Cheesecake Factory! :)"}
{"text":"The hostesses asked if my date and I were okay with a 2 top table. What they failed to mention is that the particular table is so small it can't fit two plates and two menus and we were also next to a 10 person party of screaming women. One lady was scream talking so loud that I was getting a headache. Lara was nice enough to move us to another spot and tried her best, but I could still hear the woman as well as the echos from around the whole restaurant. Ruined my date night. Food was okay, service was okay, but I was not impressed overall. Not really a place for a romantic dinner for two. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am going our of my way to leave my very first Yelp review. Thank you Shonya for being such a fantastic server. Very professional, friendly and attentive. We have been here in the past and did not experience the same level of service that she provided. Having a server like her makes us want to return. The food was delicious and fresh, portions were large and we had plenty to take home. We will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is yummy. They have the most amazing veggie burger that is actually handmade, and I love their french fries. Plus, of course, the cheesecake is fantastic. Try the cookie dough cheesecake!

Oh, and the asian salad is enormous. fyi."}
{"text":"I am usually a Cheesecake Factory fan, but my experience this time was only sub-par.  I arrived at 12:30 pm on Sunday and the wait was over 1 hour.  I realize this isn't the fault of the restaurant, but that time just seemed excessive.  I was actually seated in about 35 minutes.   
I ordered the Salmon and Steak Diane combo and asked for the Miso salmon instead of the herb salmon and the server said that would be okay.  They have done it for me in the past and I figured they would do it again.   Well, they brought out my meal with the herb salmon and I was sadly disappointed.  The server seemed a little busy and a bit disheveled.  
I tried their special salted caramel cheesecake.   It may be my new favorite one.   The cheesecake is work 5 stars, but the service and food brought it down to 3."}
{"text":"I heard about Cheesecake Factory from \"The Big Bang\" TV Show, so when I went there my first time, I was expecting something different, but since my arrival everything was amazing, I loved the place, the service n the food...since then I keep coming back to try n enjoy new dishes :)"}

{"text":"I've never been a Cheesecake food chain fanatic, but i have to admit the cheesecakes are sooooo good. I usually go just for that. I'm not crazy about all the food on the menu. I stopped in here for a slice of cheesecake since I was shopping in the area. The customer service was good and of course I ordered my favorite, the red velvet cheesecake. It was packed and ready by the time I paid for my food and I couldn't have been happier. I didn't get a picture because I savored every bite by the time I got home and forgot to take a picture!"}
{"text":"Save your money. Don't spend it on watered down alfredo & bunk chicken. Called to have an order ready 2 hours in advance & still had to wait 23 minutes upon visiting. Manager didn't do anything about it & neither did the company. Terrible, awful & nasty for $20 plate."}
{"text":"Basically:

Appetizers = pretty standard, warm crab and artichoke dip was good

Meals = not worth the hype, Cajun jambalaya flavours were bland even after adding Tabasco sauce and pasta was clumpy :(

Cake = worth the hype , very satisfied :)(if you like very sweet cheesecakes)"}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by admitting I didn't want to come here and I don't like chain restaurants like this, but someone we were going out to eat with really wanted to go here.

The restaurant was crazy busy and it's huge, so it was really loud.  The tables are like a faux-marble type material, so when the bus-boys were setting the tables and throwing down the utensils repeatedly, the sounds got real old fast.

We went here for lunch  and got the nachos with chicken as our app.  There was literally 5 random pieces of chicken on the nachos and it was gross and the flavoring was super sweet, which is weird to put on nachos.  The chips were saturated in grease and I'm not really sure why...

I ordered the Monterrey Burger to be cooked medium.  It was burnt/charred in some spots and completely brown throughout the burger.  It wasn't that great.  The arugula it came with was put on top of the hot burger, so it was all wilted and not the best consistency.  I only ate half my burger.  

We all got cheesecake since we felt like we kind of had to.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it fell short IMO.  The cheesecake itself was delicious! However, it was covered in thick chocolate cake and it was so rich - I didn't eat that part.

Overall, it was pretty much what I expected from a place like this."}
{"text":"You would think I would have learned my lesson after getting very sick eating their spaghetti carbonara two years ago--- and I have a cast iron stomach. But no. This past Sunday my family stopped here for dinner our way back from a long road trip--- we had not eaten since breakfast. Our server was friendly and courteous and yes, they do have a huge menu. We each ordered different things. My husband ordered the fish and chips. About 8 hours later in the middle of the night (and not having eaten anything else), he was extremely and violently sick. Sick for 2 and a half days, in fact. There is no way I will ever go near the place again. This time I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"My two star review went to my server and the cheesecake itself. 
I was starving when I got there and was told the wait was 15 minutes. I figured I'd order a cheesecake to go while I waited so I can eat something. My pager went off so when I turned it in, I told the lady I'm waiting for my order. She took the pager and called the next name so I proceeded back in line. A guy calls my name and I tell him the same story so he said he was getting me seated since he can't hold tables and would have my order transferred. He said they were busy. Then he asked if I needed a menu and I said no.( I knew what I wanted. Not the friendliest guy.

So as I get seated, there was a five minute wait for a server to ask me what I had so I have her the receipt and she took my drink order. I was starving at that point and saw how busy it was I knew I didn't want to eat there. My cheesecake was finally brought to me after my drink and surprisingly I wasn't asked if I wanted anything. I couldn't wait to leave.

I love the Cheesecake Factory but this left a bad taste in my mouth. The server was nice enough to give me a to go cup for my lemonade."}
{"text":"Afternoon lunch gone bad 4 my company.  Usually a great day here but alas not today. My mom tried her favorite dish orange chicken but it had to be sent back twice.  Even when asking for sauce when the dish was remade it was an epic fail, cold sauce.  This meal was like adding injury to insult 4 here. Our waitress really tried to make it better. My firecracker salmon was yummy. Dad's meal was good 2. The manager did stop to try to make sure she was ok and so paying for what she did try on her meal. Alas no leftovers or meal 4 mom here today."}
{"text":"My family enjoys the food at this Cheesecake Factory. We always order the Thai Lettuce wraps with grilled chicken satay, fresh vegetables, curry noodles & their 3 dipping sauces (peanut, sweet tamarind & cilantro). All the ingredients combined creates a explosion of flavors with every bite ! My family sometimes order one of their burgers with a side of sweet potato fries & of course a side of ranch dip for the fries. And, of course their cheesecake is always delicious! Service is a hit or miss at this location & their free bread  is sometimes hard/cold."}
{"text":"Check it out:

I was picking up take out on Valentine's Day for me and my gorgeous dime piece of a woman, because I love her and she deserves it. We like to eat at home on V-Day, in case a romantic mood strikes and we need to handle our valentine's Day extracurricular activities right there on the spot. 
Pretty much every pasta dish here is so bomb, it makes my spirit soar and my body react in a borderline sexual manner, so naturally, Cheesecake Factory take out was our decision this fine evening. 

Now listen, I'm not exaggerating when I say there was a line of 5-10 cars waiting for take out and the manager Sara was running around the parking lot, directing traffic, fighting crime, carrying 5 bags at a time, and heroically getting people's food to them in the cold. She was like Wonder Woman. At one point, I think she actually flew but I can't say for certain. She was dodging cars, slinging that delicious cheesecake left and right, just being a straight take-out savage, as we all stood by like PEASANTS in the presence of a higher power. Impressed by her service, I tried to tip her and she wouldn't let me (which is my only real complaint) 

If Sara doesn't have a raise/promotion the next time I come back here, I will be taking her, my top notch review and my business to a more deserving restaurant.

Long live Sara the Great."}
{"text":"Took my kids to eat. I was told there was a 10 minute wait after waiting for almost 40 minutes I asked the hostess why everyone walking in the door was being seated before me and my kids. She had no response but told me she would check on it. Which she did but left to go hide. 
Racism is still out there but never expected it from this establishment my money is not worth any less than the white folks that walked in to eat 20 minutes after we did. 
Never got serviced and we walked away after 38 minutes."}

He ended up cutting his mouth on a sharp skewer which was inside of his corn dog. - Honestly I have never been so upset or disappointed in a restaurant in my life.

Update: I did talk to the on service manager, however only after being on hold for 15 mins, then calling back and demanding to talk to her. - She was polite and helpful and generated an incident report. I have asked to have the Head Manager (Steve) to call when he reviews the incident report. - I will update this further at that point."}

{"text":"I'd rather go to an actual Cheesecake Factory, and I don't even like Cheesecake.

Cheesecake factory is like getting the same gift for your birthday every year, and you didn't want it the first time around.  You know what to expect, it won't make you happy, yet here you are again.

While always living up to my below average expectations, this place has one thing going for it, the decor.  It looks bright and nice and welcoming.  The food is average at best, and way overpriced for what it is.  Chilis or Fridays can match anything this place has, and at a few bucks cheaper.  

Come because you're hungry, leave your leftovers....."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, wide variety of options on the menu. Good for vegetarians too. I am a fan of their Veggie burger and Evelyn's Favorite Pasta.
The complimentary bread is amongst the best too, definitely beats Olive garden, especially the brown one.
I've tried only one of their chocolate Cheesecakes and I liked when when I began eating but it was too big for me to enjoy till the end. It would be a good idea to split a slice amongst two people.
This restaurant may seem a little pricey but the portions are big and the ambience and service easily make it worth it."}
{"text":"so, we had a pretty bad experience tonight. 
my husband took me here tonight for my birthday. he planned this for a while. 
we get there at 8:30pm. we were politely greeted and immediately say. first thing, something I have noticed before but didn't write a review because we've never had a bad experience, but the FLOOR. the floor here is SO slick you can easily fall and get seriously hurt, so a message to corporate: fix this before you find yourself in a lawsuit. 
now to the overall experience which is why I'm here. now off the gate, our waiter was good and our drinks were 8.5/10 so no complaints there. the food though? my husband ordered the filet and I ordered the shrimp/steak combo. my husband ordered his steak medium and I ordered mine medium rare. once we received our food and cut into them, my husband's steak was closer to rare but he ended up keeping it, but left about 3/4 uneaten because once it cooled off he found it an edible. my (medallions, not actually steak which the menu didn't say) were WELL done. I sent them back and said I would just take the filet and pay the difference. the waiter politely said he would do that. we waited close to 20min. to get my replate, once I cut into it, it was so rare that it was cool in the center. once again, sent the plate back. got the 2nd once back much faster but after waiting and was better. but after waiting so long to eat, I really wasn't hungry anymore so I took a few bites and took it to go. both times, the waiter brought the plates, never spoke to a manager yet two different ones cleared our plates without a word about the food. 
my husband ordered a whole cheesecake that we after found out they only had a few slices left of, which we ended up getting anyway. my husband proceeded to pay and I went to the restroom which, was disgusting. 
the first two toilets were clogged, trash on the floor, and no soap in one of the dispensers, hardly any in the other. 

overall, just not a good night for us at the cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in at around 8:30pm for dinner. We told the hostess that we wanted to sit at a table near the bar and she nodded and said \"okay.\" Nobody brought us menu's and we sat there for a good 10 minutes without anyone coming up to us. There were servers coming and going around us. The bartender even took a few glances at us and he didn't even come by. We were very disappointed to not get any service at all! Now I know why there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. I spoke to the hostess and let her know and she mentioned some servers were going home but she will find one for us. Ummmm...okay?! We just left after I saw her talking to a second server that \"might\" want to help us. Will not be going there again!"}

Bad: need to wait so long time."}

Came out a third time and it was slightly more done but still pretty red. Poor kid stuck to the mashed potatoes. Service has really gone downhill there (I haven't been in about a year). No wonder the wait was close to nil."}

{"text":"Went here with the family on Saturday evening for Fathers Day.  The waiter and overall service was excellent.  However the food was disappointing.  Not one of us had anything good to say about their meal. It was just the average lukewarm food you get at all the franchise restaurants.  The Cheesecake Factory used to be a step above the Applebee's of this world but I guess no more."}
{"text":"I would score this place negative 20 if Yelp would let me.    I had to give it one star just so I could put a review into yelp.    We ate tonight with 6 adults and 2 kids.  Kids got food right away.  Adult drinks came haphazard over a 40 minute period.  Pineapple Mojito being last and half of us never got the water we ordered.  Food came about 70 minutes after we ordered.  (Mind you- smaller tables around us arrived later and were already eating and turning over yo new guests).   I made the mistake of ordering a rare cheeseburger ( not raw with a light grill surface and not medium- barely pink-  and yes I checked with waitress at order time to manage expectations) So of course my burger was medium .  Not waiting for someone to check 10 minutes later I tracked down a server to have ut corrected.  I was told right away - haha.  Manager (Rob H.) shows up 10 minutes lates to apologize and say just a few more minutes.  Tic toc tic tic - 7 more minutes pass and waitress shows p with check and quick hides it when she realizes zistill have no dinnrr.  Manager appears with a raw burger gray on outside and cold cheese on top and announces this  is a  raw burger.  a little back and forth later he takesit back ,  offers a free piece of cake for the kids who are on way out door so no thank you.  Insult to injury they had the nerve to charge for both the wrong burgers and only take off price of one burgers .  Yes after complaining he fixed check but really does this sound like it was a customer friend family pre-wedding  celebration????  Hell no !! run from this incredibly poor managed/ run cheesecake factory.  There are great choices up and down the street with better food, service and prices."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has been around forever, but this was the first time I ate there. They had so many types of cheesecake that it was difficult to choose. Also, they were humongous and yummy! The food was what I would say is your average chain-food type of food--not great and  not bad. I liked their extensive menu with so many choices and know I'll be back to try some of their other things."}
{"text":"If I could give this cheesecake 0 stars I would. Our server seemed to have an attitude. We ordered a pasta with easy sauce but it was FULL of sauce. When we told the server she didn't seem to care nor did the manager. The least they could have done was say I'm so sorry the kitchen made a mistake. The manager didn't seem to care that I was disappointed in the service of his employees. We also got hot tea and the water was Pretty much cold. I won't be going back to this location and it makes me not want to go back to the other locations as well."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food. -1 stars for the wait time and service. Honey truffle chicken is my favorite dish. My best friend comes here every year for her birthday and I look forward to it. However, especially on that day, it sucks that they don't take reservations because the wait is always 30 mins+. Also hate when I request a specific, classic drink and agree to pay more and am still given some disgusting well drink."}
{"text":"This is the story me and my family where sited  outside we have waited 22 minutes to be exact and we did not get serves the beast part is that after 16 minutes I talked to the hostess and still no one showed up"}
{"text":"I've sat here for over 2 hours watching table after table being sat while they ignore our group. We may be a larger party but I've watched whole sections of tables that were perfect for us, be filled by couples who arrived long after we did. We called early, we arrived early and nothing changed. This is the worst service. I'm appalled."}
{"text":"Overhyped -- A good spot for desert once things calm down. 

This is an okay spot for desert. I would not however reccomend it for dinner. Much of the food at our table was served cold, the chicken and potatoes were bland, the burger was overcooked. We also found the service to be chaotic. 

Suprisingly enough, they did have a large selection of cheesecakes that many seemed to enjoy -- the only thing making this a 2-star review instead of 1-star. 

Overall, it is very difficult to justify the 3 hour wait and the price paid for truly sub-par fare and service."}
{"text":"Disappointed.   We have not been to this location in some time. Went here for dinner for birthday and my husband ordered his usual ribeye dinner.  I dont know what they served him but it was not a ribeye.  The manager came to our table to tell us that's what THEIR ribeyes looked like. 
He ended up not eating anything.  I ordered my usual but it was a much smaller serving than usual from another location.  I've always loved The Cheesecake Factory but we will stick with the location we normally go to."}
{"text":"What is so damn hard about adding butter to the bread for take out. You spend 100 bucks on a meal and can't get freaking butter for the bread. Every single damn time!"}
{"text":"Love their cheesecake it is good for your soul. The atmosphere is good and the food is great as well. Recommend this place to all I see"}
{"text":"I bring my girlfriend here for dinner about once every couple months and this location always treats us so well. She loves the four cheese pasta and I always get the burrito. You wouldn't think a burrito at the Cheesecake Factory would be anything special but this burrito is delicious!! It's huge so I never leave feeling like I needed more to eat.  Highly recommend this place for your next special event!"}
{"text":"I would give it no stars or negative stars if I could. The last two time that I have come to this restaurant I have had the worst service.  I figured the first time it was just one of those days where things were just crazy, we have all had them, so I let it go.  However when you have two bad experiences in less than two months it's no longer just one of those days.  We say we have a party of 7 so you would understand if things were slower, however after we ordered it took over an hour to get our food, and than it didn't even come out all together.  Some of us had to wait another ten minutes while others were ashamed to be eating but didn't want it to get cold.  But wait more....  The food was cold for many of the meals and after we all had food we did not get service again unless we waived down someone.  But don't worry we got our check and of course we were charged for a big party service.  Well I can tell you we didn't enjoy our meal the service or the lack of attention we were given!!!  We will not eat here again.  Now I know it will not hurt them if they lose a few customers however it will save me from wasting my money on bad food, horrible service and  just plain my time!!!  Eat there at your own risk but know your time and food experience will be wasted on such a bad chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Party of 10 , we were told wait is 45 minute ... after waiting for an hour and a half we were told by the manager that they are still waiting for 3 guests to leave in order to use their table. These guests have already finished eating, bill paid and table cleaned. They are just sitting there talking.

We asked the manager to get us another table, he said no
We asked him to move these guests to another table so they can continue talking and we can have our meal, he said no 
We asked him to inform them that we are waiting, he said no

After Waiting for 2 hours and no table , we left 

Not sure who's at fault here, Cheesecake Factory for not training their manager or the manager himself for having no clue how to run a restaurant 


Either way they lost a regular customer."}
{"text":"Server Jessica was amazing! The place was packed, but we got lucky with self seating high-top tables. Because it was so busy, the bar was backed up. However, the cucumber mojito was well worth the wait. For an entree I got the parmesan herb chicken. It was *Donald Trump voice*  HUUUUGEEE and excellent. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've had Cheesecake Factory many times and each time I think the food is average. It's way overpriced for the quality served. Today I got the fish tacos, $15. The presentation looks great but the I could taste everything but the fish. The fish was unfortunately bland. I've had better for a lot cheaper at food trucks. I think everything on the menu is way overpriced and there are just way too many items to choose from. 

I think the cheesecakes are worth the money, they are delicious, but the actual food is really not. I'd enjoy the experience more if it wasn't so pricey. I usually don't dine here but a friend of mine wanted to for the cheesecake. 

The service is so so. Our waiter smelt of cigarettes which was a super buzz kill and really unappealing because we were about to eat. He came and went really quickly just to take our orders and serve the food but we never got a refill. We hardly saw him. I'd also like to mention that the floor is always slippery at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and this one is no exception. Maybe it's the wax they use but they should reconsider this as it is prone to lead to accidents and injury. 

Probably would only come back for dessert but nothing else."}
{"text":"I'm not into cheesecake but the main entrée was delicious. I love the atmosphere and the service."}
{"text":"I try to plan ahead and look at the menu before I go to the restaurante. The two items I wanted I was told were not served anymore. They should update their menu when changes are made.I walked out. Went next door to F.Daves no dissapointments."}
{"text":"I celebrated my 21st birthday with a group of my friends and boyfriend! Service was great, definitely try the club sandwich!! I have extras and they taste better a second time! In honor of my birthday, I ordered the strawberry daiquiri and it was just...strong but so good! Rule of thumb for the drink: take some of the strawberry as you drink it! I made the mistake of dropping it in and smudging it to get more strawberry out of it, but after eating the big chunks I realized it should have been nibbled while drinking! Awesome time!"}
{"text":"I hate spend more than $15 for pasta for 26 years.... I always think it is not worth it!! Are you kidding me Pasta costs me more than $15  Hell No!!!! 

Cheescake Factory is a chain restaurant, the menu is the same anywhere you go, the food tastes the same. 

But I was wrong........This one I am telling you!! Because of this cheesecake factory ONLY at Caesar's made me change my mind... they make me started to love pasta!! 

Oh~ my Freaking God!!!! 

They have The Best and The Best, Best , 

Best x1,000,000 * Seafood Pasta with Red Sauce * 

Ever, 

Super,

So damn GOOOOOOOD!! I would fly all the way from L.A to Vegas only for this pasta!! And you tell me how good it is?? Get Real~!!\""}
{"text":"This restaurant ruined my daughters reception dinner! We called ahead and were assured by management they would accommodate the party of 20 on Friday August 7th. Knowing this is a busy place during this time we wanted to be sure there wouldn't be a two hour wait. We get there and of course it was OVER 2 hours late and to make matters THE WORST they wouldn't seat us all together. We had to split the party in 3 different areas. I wasn't able to sit and enjoy dinner with my daughter on one of the biggest days of my life. The icing on the cake? There were 2 empty tables in her section that were never used. When my daughter inquiried to mgt he said the party for those tables never showed. REALLY?! Management ended up comping her ticket,  however I was made to pay for the overpriced food at my table with 5 of her guests, where I sat and cried and couldn't even eat. My heart is still broken that I will never recapture that special time with my only child. I hope corporate notices this review so others in our situation aren't promised something they can't fulfill."}
{"text":"We really like cheesecake factory.... sometimes. It just seems like this location is hit or miss. Sometimes we come here and it's delicious, other times not as great. Our last experience here was a not so great one.The food was really greasy for some reason and I had an upset stomach for the rest of the night.  The waitress was pretty rude, when she decided to show up to the table, until the check showed then all of the sudden she was really nice and upbeat. We assumed she did that for a tip because she did it right in the middle of us signing the check. Ugh that really bothers me.  We are always nice to our servers and we are not hard to please. I wish I could say that maybe she just had a long day but she told us that she just got there and she was taking over our table from the other waitress who's shift was ending and I have to say she was so much nicer at the end of a shift than our new waitress at the beginning of her shift. Like I said at the start of this review, we like cheesecake factory but will probably not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I just had the best experience here. They were able to accommodate my special diet due to a genetic disorder. Eating out was always bland for me because I had to get just veggies etc. But today the people here were able to cook my low protein noodles and add a DELICIOUS marinara sauce. I felt so normal for once. Thank you Cheesecake factory! I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"5:00 pm Our party of 4 arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, located across from Sephora at West Town Mall. Was handed a buzzer and told the wait time was around 30 min. 

5:15 pm Pleasantly surprised to feel the buzzer going off. We walked back and waited as instructed on the side of the hostess desk to be seated. We were greeted by our hostess and proceeded to follow her to the exterior dining patio area only to see the table bestowed on us was not cleared off and therefore not ready. We marched back to where the hostesses converge and given another buzzer on a cusp promise of a short wait.

5:20 pm We were herded to our real table now, conveniently 10 feet from the hostess beehive and in front of the Cheesecake counter area of the restaurant.

5:25 pm Our server appears along with another gentleman whom I cannot distinguish between a manager or a server-in-training. We were given menus and drink orders (three waters and an ice tea) taken.

5:30 pm Our drinks appear and we are asked if we would like their complimentary bread basket. We are agreeable. Our group ordered the Clam chowder soup of the day as well as the mini corn dogs to start.

5:45 pm Our orders are jotted and bread basket are served. We received two baskets of a crusty sourdough and a soft dark bread, which tasted like a honey wheat brown bread, this was the star in our group. 

5:55 pm We asked for refills for both the drinks and bread. Our soup and mini corn dogs arrive. The corn dogs was one-length hot dog at one time, cut into four sections, dipped in cornmeal batter and fried to perfection. Strangely this was served with mustard and it took another couple of minutes to try to flag a waitstaff (not ours) down for ketchup. The chowder was delicious, meaty pieces of clam and potatoes in a thick, creamy base.

6:25 pm As we waited with baited breath, a woman in a black blazer comes to our table to reassure us that she saw our food and it will arrive \"within a couple of minutes\".

6:40 pm Three of the four entrees grace our table. We are given a promise that the fourth entree, Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi would be arriving shortly. Alas! The fourth arrives three minutes later.

The Chipotle Chicken Pasta was strangely sweet, it had an aftertaste of chipotle, but was otherwise not spicy as the menu indicated. There were sufficient amount of chicken, that was again strangely soft, almost too tender.

Two people ordered the Steak Diane, one as the meal and one as a combination with shrimp scampi. This was a standout in our group. Succulent, flavorful, medallions of Angus beef steak were bathed in black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. It was perfectly smothered in caramelized onions and baby portobello and shiitake mushrooms. Both arrived with mashed baby lusciously lumpy red potatoes. The shrimp scampi were not what we had in mind, as lightly sauté minimalist. Instead these were almost breaded and pan fried. I am not complaining, but again, just strange as expectations from the menu described as sautéed did not meet reality. 

Another solid dish was their Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. It came with Andouille sausage, juicy chunks of tomato, diced peppers, onions, and garlic, topped with a generous portion of white rice. I am having a hard time reconciling with the chicken, it's again a little too rubbery for me. I did appreciate the medium sized peeled and deveined shrimp. 

7:15 pm We asked for a to-go box and the cheesecake menu (the variety is over a pages long). Since we were familiar with the pace of service, we asked for the bill as well.

7:20 pm The bill and boxes arrive, but no cheesecake menu. In hindsight, we could have just grabbed one ourselves, being seated so close to the hostess podium. However, in our mode of glutton, we simply could not be motivated to do so.

7:25 pm We flagged another waitress and she handed us a menu. I wonder if she saw the disparity in our eyes, as we metaphorically clung to her. We decided on the Sea Salt Caramel ($7.95). 

7:30 pm Again, we are seated in front of the pre-made, cheesecake variety display. We were once again told that our cheesecake is coming while nothing appeared in front of us.

7:35 pm The cheesecake makes its appearance like an overzealous celebrity. It's what you dreamed of seeing, you have great expectations of this individual, you clearly overpaid for the privilege of experiencing this event live, but it disappoints you and even annoy you a bit by arriving late and have the appearance of their bad, ugly, meme. The cheesecake was the frozen version of what you can get at Sam's, but on steroids, if steroids were a layer of condensed cake underneath the cheesecake. 

As you can see it took well over 2 hours for the entire dinner.There were no adjustments to our bill for the tardy service nor any acknowledgement of the room temp Steak Diane, all in all, it was $104 for four people before tip. 

We came, we conquered, and the hype defeated us."}
{"text":"Located in the North Premium Outlet mall, having been given a gift card, we decided to stop here after shopping and wanting a drink.

We didn't order food and sat at the bar. But then again, once you've eaten at one Cheesecake Factory, you've eaten at them all. 

The lovely bartender took and made our drink orders straight away. We ordered a passion fruit mojito and a Long Island Ice Tea. Total with tip came to be about $25.

The mojito was deliciously served in a tall Pilsner glass. The fresh mint leaves was a refreshing treat. The LIIT was also good, with a heavy pour, but then again it's a LIIT."}
{"text":"I've visited a few Cheesecake Factory's in USA, and I've never been disappointed. 
They have the largest menu I've ever seen, and all dishes have good quality. 

And I love their original Cheesecake!!!"}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants I've been to (and we eat out once or twice a week so we've sampled quite a few), Cheesecake Factory is the one that I've had the best service at, hands down, no matter the location.  Other restaurants might have service that is as good from time to time, but only at Cheesecake Factory has the service been excellent every single time I've been there.

The food is also very good, and the menu has a lot of variety on it.  The one thing I don't like about it, though, is the ridiculous portion sizes/calorie counts.  I never finish an entire dinner meal (lunch for the next day, at least!) but even eating half of the portion I feel like I definitely shouldn't be ordering dessert.  They do have some lighter options, but not nearly as many as I've seen at similar restaurants.  Cheesecake Factory certainly is not helping obesity rates in our country, but with a little self-control I think it's a fabulous place to eat!"}
{"text":"The food was all right at the best. For a Saturday night wait was kind of long. This place is lower compare to chilli's  with double price. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend for someone with small babies and possibly energetic toddlers
The tables are very crowded which makes the whole experience bad and loud as well. Strollers are not allowed inside of the restaurant probably because it's set up in an overcrowded way. For us...my friends new born bedded their stroller because it has a bassinet and she could also rock the baby. But this was not allowed in the restaurant. So she had to hold her baby all the way through dinner. The server did mention that it would be better if we brought along a car seat... but not everyone uses a car seat and an adaptor for their strollers.  
Food wise I think it's just ok. Their steak Diane was marinated and matched its price (20something) but the ribeye steak was not up to standArd and it was Around 37 before tax, the rib eye they uses is not good. It was very lean and a bit over cooked. 
Service was great. Our sever was very tired but she kept smiling and trying to make us happy. 
Again, ambience was not baby friendly."}
{"text":"Our girls were begging for us to take them for dinner and cheese cake. We decided to try the out. It was a horrible experience. First the waiter was so busy she never even looked at us or give us ant real atention. She was rushing us to give her the drink order and pushing to order our food as soon we sat down. I hate waiters to rush me before I even have a chace to look at the menu. I ordered a Cesar Salad  wirh Chicken when I started eating I found a long black hair tangled the the lettuce. So gross. Then my daughter's meatball and spaghetti pasta came. OMG! Horrible no taste completely cold and the plate all dirty with this disgusting tomato sauce. Sent it back asked for them to write off from check and the only thing they took out was the salad. The supposed Manager came to the table, a very sloppy looking blonde older woman, never gave eye contact or an apology, just told me she would get me another salad. Another salad? Forget it!  One hair was enough. Our family will never be back to eat here again. A $90.00 check was a complete slap on the face. Very disapointed ."}
{"text":"Great place for... Cheesecake and their mixed drinks are good too. Atmosphere is amazing and service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is a great place to eat but the service is a little slower. The people are very nice there. It is very fancy but you don't need to dress up and that's what I like about. It  is kind of expensive but that's okay because the food is great. there whenever I eat the cheesecake it's like eating a little piece of heaven. It is a great restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed infrequent visits to Cheesecake Factory over the years.  The restaurants are always clean and pleasant and this visit was no exception.

The staff was friendly and our server was very accommodating as four of us tried to make lunch selections from their huge menu.

While I found my Chinese Chicken Salad to have far too much dressing and far too little chicken the greens appeared to be very fresh and the won ton strips crisp.  The other three persons were happy with their choices ranging from Fish Tacos, Meatloaf and a Chicken a salad sandwich and salad.  We shared a cheesecake and it was delicious.  I counted 37 different cheesecakes on the menu!

Prices are moderately high but acceptable.  If you know you're going here it would benefit you to look at the menu online to save time and indecision once you arrive."}
{"text":"Sorry for picking a chain restaurant as my favorite...but the sheer selection and consistency at every location is what keeps me coming back.  The food is good large and priced right.  The cocktails are a tad expensive but good!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow at 10pm. The waitress was lost thence found her.  Great food when it arrived. I almost forgot I ordered"}
{"text":"I have been going to TCF for over 12 years in Scottsdale at Kierland. Never disappointed. We got the fish tacos, fried shrimp platter and 2 slices of cheesecake. 
The fish tacos were extremely disappointing from this location. I've had them at Kierland and they were great. One of my tacos was 80% fried batter.  They did not give me limes like every picture has from this place, disappointing because there was a lack of flavor on the actual tacos. Only finished them because I added Cholula from home. The fried shrimp platter was decently sized buy another disappointment,  they use regular fries and Kierland uses shoestring fries which make all the difference. Next , on the tacos I asked for no beans because I have an allergy and if I could just have double rice. I only got one serving of rice. About 3/4c size. For 16$ the tacos were a huge disappointment. Considering we drove from the Cave creek area to Glendale to pick it up I guess my standards were the standards I have at the Scottsdale location. The shrimp platter 4/5 stars, even ordering extra cocktail sauce, the 2 small containers weren't enough 18$.  Fish tacos 16$ 3/5 , size, over breaded, no limes, no sour cream ,no chipotle sauce like the menu says and small rice portion . I guess I expected what I saw from other reviews in pictures, the burned tortillas and lack or toppings just made the fish dry and lack in flavor.
Cheesecakes 4/5 
These are definitely smaller sizes than I've had at Scottsdale and in Boulder,Colorado. Same prices. Just smaller portions . 

Total bill 53$ . Overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We will never go back and I will tell everyone not to go. Last time we went it was the same thing but figured we'd try again. First, the draft was broken so no draft beers. Then took forever to take our orders. We waited over an hour for part of the food to arrive. The manager comes out and says they are behind in the kitchen, no kidding. They bring 2 of the 5 orders, not even the he kids food. The potatos were cold, not even warm. We finally gave up and left after about 5 minutes and the other 3 plates never came out. Never ever again."}
{"text":"The arrival of The Cheesecake Factory at Yorkdale has come with much fanfare!  
Having been to several US locations, I was familiar with the menu and looked forward to my visit with a gal pal.  We arrived mid-afternoon and checked in with the hostess to receive our pager.  Our wait-time was on point and we were seated within that wait-time as promised.  

Our server, Krystin, was wonderful.  She checked off all of the boxes - professional, polite and personable.  

We ordered a house salad to share and the \"skinny salmon\".  The salad was a generous portion to enjoy with their amazing brown bread.  The mains were flavourful, cooked to our requests and accompanied by seasonal vegetables.  

To finish off our meal we indulged in our cheesecake favourites - a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake for me and a slice of Red Velvet cheesecake for my dining partner.  Unbeknownst to me, my friend had requested that my slice came with \"birthday wishes\".  I was serenaded by staff with a chorus of Happy Birthday complete with candles, candy confetti and extra whip creme.  

It was an awesome visit to The Cheesecake Factory and we look forward to making a return visit soon!"}
{"text":"We started our day at the North Las Vegas Premium Outlet and I saved my stomach just for this. We arrived around 12:48 PM and we were led to a table right away. It wasn't extremely busy but most tables were occupied. I ordered a hot cafe mocha, spicy chicken chipotle pasta (lunch special), and a white chocolate raspberry truffle. We were also served with complimentary breadsticks. They were warm and were great to munch on before our meal. 

The cafe mocha was large but nothing too spectacular regarding the flavour. It was a standard mocha. The spicy chicken chipotle pasta smelled delicious when it arrived. I also added some Parmesan cheese on top. The crispy tortilla chips added an extra crunch to the dish and I enjoyed it. The spicy chicken was flavourful, and had a nice kick. There were also pieces of asparagus and green peas to add a little green to the dish. However, I thought the pasta itself were too firm, it would have been better if they were softer. 

I took a long time to decide which cheesecake to get because they just had so many! After much contemplation, I settled for the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. It was a big slice with whipped cream on top and on the side. It was truly delightful, it wasn't too sweet which I liked. At first I was worried that it would be too sweet but not at all. The cheesecake itself was smooth and creamy, with a great balance between the white chocolate and raspberry. I cannot wait to try their other cheesecake next time I'm in the States.

Service was great, the server dropped by to check up on us and made sure everything was good. Food arrived in a timely manner. I asked for a to-go cup for my mocha and I received one promptly. Overall, I had a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We came early on a weekday for lunch, so the line wasnt nearly as long as itd usually be. 

The Canadian menu is exactly the same as the one they have in the US. I've been to cheese cake factory a few times in the US. In comparison, the Canadian cheese cake factory feels sloppy.. and slow. 

We ordered their most famous chicken dish - maderia  chicken and the chicken cutlet with mashed potato (forgot it's name ). The maderia chicken was paired with a wine sauce and mushrooms. It tasted an awful lot like an Asian chicken dish you can get from those Chinese take out places. It almost came with a large side of mashed potato. Unfortunately , you can still see there were chunks of potato in the mash. 

When in cheese cake factory, one must never leave without ordering cheesecake, even if it's to go. The cheese cake slices we ordered we're very standard. But they took 15 mins to come . 

Our totol came up to $90 .. can't say it was worth it for what we got"}
{"text":"I met a friend for a casual dinner on a Saturday night before going to a symphony at The Smiths Center. We sat at the and the bartender quickly gathered our order for some cocktails.

The Tropical Martini tastes like you should be on a cruise ship.  The martini glass has a sugar rim and the fruit taste is very refreshing.

We shared the Caesar salad and the firecracker salmon. The firecracker salmon is in a crisp wrapper that is very light and the salmon is soft and cooked well.  The Caesar salad is always good at Cheesecake Factory. Perfect blend of Parmesan and dressing.

The bartender was attentive and checked on us appropriately."}
{"text":"people talk about some fancy pants dessert when they talk about this place.
what do i talk about?

...really good pork tenderloin.
what?  you're going to the cheesecake factory, you say?
they have really good pork tenderloin.

hahha.  i just said tenderloin.

oh.  i guess they have good dessert too.  but i mean, the PORK."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time here. Yes it was short and simple but everything I expected!  When my friend and I came it was only a 15 min wait. When we sat down our server Nate, didn't rush to take our order. No, he didn't suggest anything but I knew that he just started his shift. I had a Carmel Royale macchiato which was on point! The calamari,  was crispy, little to salty but very good with the garlic sauce. And ofcoarse what we originally came for was the cheesecake! My friend,  order the pecan turtle cheesecake breath taking! And I order the warm apple crisp, delightful!  Everything came on a timely manner! I enjoyed eating here! Thank you Nate!"}
{"text":"Nice location and busy even on weekdays like Monday night. Overall service was good until my son is served with his order or pepperoni pizza with burned pepperonis. And you can tell coz the edges and the middles part of pepperonis are totally black. If you're the chef and the server/waitresses, would u still serve it?. It's not just over cooked its totally burnt... so think about that. Their utensils like knives, forks and spoon are just sitting on top of the table, who knows how dirty the tables are. Should be placed on top of a cloth or just leave it  on top of the plate and napkins... how DIRTY. When we complained abt the pizza the waiter just said do u want the manager... no apologies or like let me just get U another one. My son ended up only eating the pizza itself. We don't want to re order it since we're in a hurry... their water tastes so bad too. And the mugs needs to be replaced you can tell they have been using it for more than 2 decades lol!!! So experience for me is one star. Will never go back to this location. Ceasars palace would probably be better. Don't go to this location so disappointing.."}
{"text":"It was great years ago when Charlotte did not have as many places.  There are so many better places to go now.  The food is average.  The service is very good.  The dessert is excellent.  Overall it is a 3"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that if you let the wait times get to you, all the while holding extremely high expectations (guys, this is technically your standard chain restaurant in the U.S - it's not supposed to be some mind-blowing culinary experience), obviously you'll feel the need to make harsher critiques and are bound to have a more negative experience. 

I waited in line for a buzzer at 3:05pm (there's a line that starts by the end of the hall in front of Victoria's Secret), and got my buzzer at 3:10. Even before reaching the front desk, a nice lady warned me about the 3.5-4 hour wait with my 4 person party, which I already anticipated (shopping kills that time so quickly). The tall bald man distributing buzzers was also super nice and patient! We ended up getting seated at 7:20 but he sincerely apologized for the long wait times. 

Our waitress (I think her name was Jess?) was so genuinely kind and patient with us as we asked questions about the menu, how to order cheesecakes to go, etc. The food came quickly, just shortly after the warm bread (the brown bread is to die for!) was served, and in huge portions! I was kind of iffy looking at the prices, but the portions here are like twice the size you'd get elsewhere for the same price. Some items are hit and miss, but I would definitely eat here again once (if) the hype dies along with the long wait times. Nothing tasted cold, old, or stale, and pretty much everything we got (you can ask your waiter what the most popular items are, like the mac n cheese balls) was packed with flavour!

If you plan on walking around the mall or shopping anyways, I'd pick up a buzzer after the lunch and before the dinner rushes (2-3pm; as soon as I lined up, the line almost extended to Shoppers DM within 2 minutes) so you can have your dinner around 6-7pm! It was well worth the wait for me :)"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good. We tend to come here annually at Christmastime while shopping at the mall. Went last week with the ladies and had the ultimate food envy watching my cohort eat a chicken salad sandwich. Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots. 
My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional. I always have a sense of trepidation when I pore over the such an extensive menu. But 3 out of 3 dishes were a winner. Yet another chain with multiple locations in the valley."}
{"text":"I love ordering this but at this particular restaurant it was salty and darker than usual. Will not be returning to this location. Plus the one delivering the food walked right past me asking who's order it was."}
{"text":"I've never been here before... It was my first time and everything was delicious. I ate white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and my friend ate hot sundae fudge. I think it was the best... I'll come here again because I wanna eat dinner here. Our waiter is Daniel. He was the perfect"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love their food considering the hype. But I was disappointed after waiting for an hour for takeout, not including waiting for a cashier to take my order. 

I ordered the carbonara and two cheesecakes: tiramisu and the banana cream. The carbonara was nothing special. And it was 20 dollars, not worth it in my opinion. The cheesecakes were both light, not too sweet and it was smooth. But it didn't amaze me and they were 10 dollar for each. 

Service: Not impressed. They told me to come back 30 minutes for the food which I did and the food was not ready. I waited a whole hour for it. And the pasta was cold. Also, when I show the guy my receipt to pick up my food, he just took it and then went on to help other customers without telling me what is going on. It was after 10 minutes of me trying to get his attention that he told me that the food wasn't ready yet. He should've told me that instead of ignoring me."}
{"text":"Great food, terribly slow service.  Called ahead and ordered two slices of cheesecake to pick up.  After arriving and calling in waited nearly an hour to get our food.   Thinking this may be a fluke tried again a few months later, and a third time a few months after that, each time the same deal.  Curbside to go is a joke here."}
{"text":"It was great that they were quick to respond with an apology and that was all they gave. I feel like that's not enough, for the a stay in a hospital due to incompetence among the service staff. We were told on the 9th of May they were looking into it. But that was the last we have heard from them. That's just sad and poor management."}
{"text":"My sister really wanted to try this place so we decided to go on a Thursday night not knowing how long the wait tim would be. They gave us a beeper and said that it would take 1:30-2 hours for us to get a seat. We were beeped two hours later when my fiancé was about to pass out from hunger. When we got seated our waiter was polite and attentive. We order the cheeseburger spring roles and the taquitos as appetizers. They were both really good. For entrees we ordered a chicken piccata, the Louisiana parmesan chicken pasta, and the chipotle chicken pasta. All three were really good though the pasta in the two pasta dishes could have been cooked a litttllleeee bit more. And the portions are HUGE. Even my fiance who is a big guy had to get the rest of his in a doggy bag. For deserts we ordered a celebration cheesecake, coffee and cream cheesecake, and the Godiva brownie ice cream. They were all pretty good, however, especially the brownie one was extremely heavy and the ice cream was not good. The cheesecakes were amazing though despite how heavy they are. I would recommend splitting the desert. The prices could be considered regular leaning toward higher. We paid $150 for three people. Overall, i would definitely go again and give them 4.5 stars. I will probably go during lunch because patience is hard to practice at 7 or 8 in the evening."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Service is always awesome and the menu is huge, even the pickiest eaters can find something to satisfy their pickiness the cheesecake is so delicios! Always have to get a piece to go."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie burger but wanted it on sourdough. They told me it was going to be served as a baguette which was fine by me. But I told them I didn't want mayo or cheese on it. When my food came there was literally NOTHING on my burger??? I mean yeah there was no cheese or mayo but no other toppings that came with it? The waiter wasn't to blame obviously. But I was with a big group of friends and it was late so I didn't want to make a big fuss to get a new burger. Waste of $14.00"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I first had to send both my bread plate and knife back for being dirty. The table was also much too small for the two of us with nowhere to set my drink. Our meal took over 2.5 hours. I ordered the jambalaya pasta. What I actually received was fajita meat on top of pasta with Cajun seasoning added. Being primarily a tomato base, canned tomatoes were used. The quality of the dish was no better than a box of hamburger helper. $80 later, there's no question. Save half of your bill and go to Chilis for that \"type\" of food. You'll also save an hour. Otherwise, if you're looking for something nice, there's too many good restaurants in Madison to even consider this place."}
{"text":"Been here several times, but tonight was a first for terrible experience. Arrived after 9pm, so there was no crowds or wait time. Order was taken quickly and the drinks/bread also quickly. That's were the good service ends. Ten, fifteen, twenty, then thirty minutes pass with no food, and no explanation or apology. Waiter only seemed concerned with chatting with friends at a nearby table. At the fourty minute mark, I left. He started to speak like he would be bringing the check for the drink then changed his mind. Offered to send a manager to the front to meet me, but after ten minutes of waiting and watch him goof off with other staff members, I left. I wont cross this restaurant off completely, but if they seat you and your waiter has a man bun, ask to change to another server."}
{"text":"I always love The Cheesecake Factory especially the one down in the South Side. Their food is amazing and their cheesecake is incredible, obviously that's why they are called the cheesecake factory! It's so pretty outside and inside! I love how the lighting is dimmed. The servers are nice as well. My favorite cheesecake is the cookie dough cheesecake, and I get that every time I go there!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently great.  I've tried many items on their extensive menu and I've never been disappointed.  I really enjoy their appetizers, the fried Calamari and Crab Cakes are a couple of my favorites.  The ambience here very nice and the staff are very friendly and attentive.  Lets not forget their incredible cheesecakes, my new favorite is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake."}
{"text":"I like the restaurant and service at the Boca Park in Summerlin. Servers are professional and friendly. Food is excellent and you get top notch service."}
{"text":"We don't order out as much as we used to but I'm super impressed with the customer service and smooth operations of the Cheesecake Factory \"Curb To Go\" and crew at The Green valley location. 

Anthony makes us feel like V.I.P's and goes above and beyond each and every time we order, even when they are full.  

Great Job Anthony!!"}
{"text":"Thai lettuce wrap is bomb.com! It's like your own little build your own lettuce wrap station. Cheesecake wise, the red velvet cheesecake is delicious.. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I do recommend sharing the slice of cheesecake because the slices are good size but a little too sweet to finish it on your own. I think it's a cute place to have a date"}
{"text":"This restaurant really lives up to previous reviews. The restaurant is huge, and there are a ton of staff. The menu is a bit too big, but everyone will find something they like. I had the chicken bellagio, and it was delicious. My husband had the chicken madeira, and he loved it too. The portions were gigantic though, and it feels like such a waste. I only managed to eat about half. We shared the chocolate mousse cheesecake and the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake, and both were amazing. I'm always impressed when such a big and busy (and afforable) restaurant can produce food this good. 

Be warned the location can be a bit noisy, and I definetly recommend being seated inside. It's a busy place as well, but we only had to wait 15 minutes to be seated when we came on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Service here is always good from the hostess to the waiter, not to mention the large selection of food. I have yet to try everything because of their expanding menu. So far all items I tried is delicious.  Being on vacation, we splurged a little on the entrees, good thing they have lunch portions. Of course we have to have dessert here, so ate only 1/2 the entrees to be able to share their scrumptious Godiva chocolate brownie sundae. Hmmm...food coma. Definitely one of favorite places to do, consistent in all locations I have visited."}
{"text":"My niece found a piece of glass in her French fries - we told the waitress, and she told the manager - and it took him 15 minutes to come over to see if she was ok - no apologies - we had a party of 10 - and the bill was over $272 - they just didn't seem to be concerned at all - very poor customer satisfaction at this place.  We have been there for the past 3 years for my mother's birthday - and this is the last time we will ever go there - any of my family - and we will be telling everyone about this!  Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is a dependable staple in our takeout rotation.  My favorite part about these guys is the consistency of the food.  Always made right, they never forget anything.  Our personal favorites include the Crusted Chicken Romano, The Jambalaya Pasta, and the Chicken Madeira.  Yes, they are known for their cheesecake but their Carrot Cake is pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"I like to dine at the bar for lunch. Female bartender is very efficient at multitasking but she likes to scream across the bar to take your order while making drinks, even when it's not busy. Today, she faced the register while she took my order. I was literally talking to her back. She tends to need to be reminded a couple of times for things. Someone please tell her to slowdown, face her customers, stop taking orders from other side of bar. She looks like she's hustling but it ends up being bad service."}
{"text":"Living in Chicago, I used to go to the Cheesecake Factory all the time so I know what a quality experience here is. Decided to give the one in Madison a try. Took 20 min to get drinks. They came out wrong. Took another 15 min to get the correct ones. Ordered two filet mignons medium and they both came out WELL done. If I'm going to pay 30$ for a steak I want it cooked right. Unfortunately we didn't have another 30 min to send our food back. When we got the check we saw the incorrect drinks had been added on.. Awful experience. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I'm not big on chain restaurants but gave this one another try mostly because I was taking a friend and her daughter out for her birthday.   3 people - no alcoholic drinks nearly $80 with the tip, how ridiculous.   Mediocre service, which had to be hunted down several times for water and soft drink refills, they didn't even give my friend anything for her birthday.  
Best part is when we were ready to leave, we were told we would have to wait because their systems were down and they couldn't close anyones bill out - so 20 minutes and no apologies or discount later, we got our check.  It will be my last time at any Cheesecake Factory, they can take their overpriced crap and keep it."}
{"text":"Very nice location. Two-floors. Came here with a very large group of about 30 people without prior notice. The waiters split us into three smaller groups which we did not mind. Two groups were next to each other. The other group was across a walkway. We were fortunate to get the waiter who was probably new. He seemed to be a little panicked while the other waiter looked like he knew what he was doing. As for the group I was in, we had to wait a long time between ordering our drinks then ordering our food. This cause us to be the last finishing our food while the other group was ready to head out the door. Other than the service, the food was as expected...Good! I give the food four out of five stars. Service was a two out of five."}
{"text":"Well, let's talk about the cheese cakes first. They are not as good as you might expect, good enough to brand this chain restaurants. We tried three and they are all over sweetened. 
Food, average but relatively affordable."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Cheesecake factory maybe a dozen times since they opened, and had always had good experiences.  I went for lunch this past weekend for the first time in a few years, and was very unpleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere (and wait - 15 minutes for 2 people at 2:30pm) were pretty much what I remembered.  The food, however, has really gone downhill.  I used to love their fish tacos because it seemed like this was the only place I could find that didn't insist on serving them breaded and deep fried and drenched in mayo.  They were completely unappetizingly plated this time.  There was hardly any slaw on them, and what was there was warm and soggy.  My husband's chicken parmesan sandwich was good, but the fries that came with it were pretty much on par with fast food, and the portion was very skimpy compared to what is typical of this restaurant (and price). 

The highlight was the option to get the small plate appetizers.  We had the chicken samosas (4 of them for about $6), which was just the right size for 2-4 people.  More restaurants should offer appetizers and desserts in small portions, and I would definitely order them more often.

The service was adequate - not bad, not great."}
{"text":"Walker has by far the Best Customer service I have EVER SEEN. He's a manager who on top of everything and pays attention. Something came up no big deal and walker went up and beyond to let us know what had happened. I can't thank him enough for being the manager who takes charges and does NOT hide in the office Like most managers.  He's there to make sure you have a great time   And that's all that matters. Plus the food was SUPER FRESH AND TASTED AMAZING 


Side note lesa the waitress was amazing nice and friendly 
Her csi was top notch."}
{"text":"A friend & I decided to go to Cheesecake Factory because it was close to work & we hadn't been in a long time. We were seated immediately & it took 10 minutes to get someone to take our drinks order. Now. Some of you might be thinking, \"You're being unreasonable.\" No. Think of a place that you go for service where is acceptable to be acknowledged after 10 minutes when is not busy as fuck. This place was no where near busy. We are then greeted by Giovanni who was plenty friendly, but not a great waiter. After taking our order we advised that we were on a break from work so we would like the check immediately. We received our check last.  Our food arrived with 20 minutes to spare from our break. He said that he would bring to go boxes with our order. Not only did we never get a to go box, but we had to borrow one of there mother fucking napkins to bring our food with us. Again, I know some of y'all are thinking, \"Bitch, you didn't have to bring your leftovers!\" Yes we did. We paid for that shit. In conclusion, hold your shit to a higher standard instead of letting your wait staff get so high. Be as baked as you would like, just handle your high & bring us a damn doggie bag!"}
{"text":"Who does not like this place? Cheese Cake Factory is always the place to go for good food. I love this location, the only complaint I have is the noise from the shops can be loud, but it is still a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"The other night my family and I went to this location to have dinner and it was the worst experience. First, there was a wait, which was fine because the place was busy. Second we got seated in a section where there was food on the floor and the server Shawn took over 20 minutes to even walk over and get our drink order. We were very upset by then because our two little girls were hungry and ready to eat. Then, once he came over he took our order for drinks and food at once, the good thing in our appetizer came out very quick which was a lifesaver. However, our food is a different story, it took SO long for it to get to us and when it did, my husband's rice was so hard and he sent it back to be replaced. After waiting for Shawn to get back to us to let him know about it he rice. The plate was brought back to much later with the same orange chicken which was cold by then with the rice replaced. As we were having our meal, finally, our drinks were not refilled and we had spent so much time there that the option of getting dessert was not even something we wanted to wait for so we got it at the cashier on our way out. Not from Shawn, he is not a very good server at all and we were extremely disappointing by our decision to dine at this location."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory is definitely way above par for your normal chain.

The menu is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. 

The menu is also HUGE. Part of that monstrosity is advertisements (annoying!) but there really is a ton to choose from.

I have weekly (if not daily) day dreams about the Avocado Egg Rolls. Holy moly this appetizer rocks my world! Yes, it's an appetizer, but I actually order it as my entree, whoops. These rolls are chocked full of crazy amounts of flavor and texture. The middle is gooey and savory and the outside is crispy and delicious. And the dipping sauce, some sort of cilantro chutney... SHUT UP! It's amazing.

I also really enjoy the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes appetizer. These little babies are sweet and salty at the same time. Very filling. Nice presentation.

My favorite appetizer salad is the French Country Salad. Veggie friendly and delish.

The only thing I've had here I have NOT enjoyed was Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It's pretty boring and lackluster, I do not recommend.

And last but definitely not least, their namesake... the CHEESECAKES. Oh lord. Yes, It's okay to come here just for cheesecake. No one will judge you.

I would like to say I've tried them all. Unfortunately I'm in love with the Tiramisu and order it EVERY time. Except for in the fall and winter when The Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake is in season."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch on mother's day and I had diarrhea that afternoon. I ordered herb crusted salmon. Something was spoiled in my food. The waitress was nice though and the bread was good."}
{"text":"We were told the wait was 45 minutes but we were seated in about 20, service was good and the waiter was polite, my daughter ordered the fettuccini alfredo with chicken which we all thought was really bland, my wife had the chicken marsala which we thought tasted kind of like a teriyaki chicken and I had the hibachi steak which was really good but small, they had to get a box for their dinners, We all had a different slice of cheesecake also,  the snickers, adams and kaluha, and we have no complaints about any of them ! we had to get a box for those too, total bill was $94 without gratuity, don't know if we will ever dine here again but definitely would order a slice to go...."}
{"text":"I recently made my visit to Las Vegas, Nevada. In the past I have always made my visits to the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered their \"chicken picata entree\" which was awesome, it consisted of lemon flavored chicken (mixed/ cooked with other high quality ingredients) and angel hair pasta. The majority of their menu is outstanding to choose from however it matters most of what you are in the mood for or ask the server to give you the best ideal selections. The customer service is stellar as well as the prices (not too steep). For the service and the food quality this place usually tops/ does better than the other 5 star rating restaurants within the Vegas strip and you wont over spend your money. The location is inside the Caesar's palace mall (forum shops) nearby the aquarium. Again they usually do a great job getting you situated upon arrival however I usually visit them during the middle of the week."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here last year and this year as well when I visited Vegas. I love the pasta here. The cheesecakes are great too, but it is super sweet. If you come at the right timing, they have a show in the evening on top of the fish tank. It was pretty cool. Service here was great, but we had a server coming up to us asking if an order was ours (not very professional...)."}
{"text":"Went right at lunch time on Sat, they said a 15 min. wait, I looked around and thought--no way, too many people, but our kids had never been so we decided to wait it out.  We were called 15 mins exactly.  I had the chicken salad sandwich, I am extremely picky about chicken salad.  It was good, I ate most of it, but it wasn't exceptional, but to make up for that it was a huge portion and they did not skimp on the quantity of white chicken meat.  The fries were just fries, I think I ate 2.  They did mess up our son's order:  soft tacos with only meat and cheese, everything else on the side.  When they arrived with thinly shredded lettuce throughout the tacos, our waiter pretty much suggested we pull them out. You CANNOT pull out shredded lettuce from a taco...  He did take them back but it took a very long time to replace.  The quality of the taco meat was good though, not the normal ground generic beef.  The mixed drinks looked good, but my husband and I just had a draft beer (only 3 or 4 to choose from, but good choices) bc we were getting ready to spend ALL day shopping in the South Park mall.   I don't mind spending money for exceptional food, but I thought this was just a little over priced for the quality and service.  We would probly go back, but mainly bc the kids loved it so much, not for the quality of the food or value."}
{"text":"Last night me and several of my coworkers went to Cheesecake Factory I have never tried it before The menu is 300 items long you have so many choices I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich with sweet potato fries and the chicken Parmesan was on a baguette which was awesome . I also received great service from our server the whole restaurant was packed but we still got fresh food and great service
The portions are great for the price if you never tried cheesecake factory I highly recommend you do"}
{"text":"I try to review chains on their individual merits. How good is this version in relation to the other clones elsewhere? For TCF, however, they seem to be universally deplorable. It's criminally unhealthy, has the most gigantic and depressing menu I've ever seen in my life, and is, as culinary experiences go, utterly lamentable. I would rather go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Alexis was super sweet, educated us on the enormous menu and provided excellent service. The food was good- as always. I suggest the \"celebration\" cheesecake, it's amazing"}
{"text":"Good food, lousy service. If the server is named Stephanie L., ask for another server or risk getting the poor service we received.  We visited on a busy Mothers' Day weekend and the service was sub-standard. First, the server forgot our appetizer and brought it out only after we asked in confusion because our main entrées came out while we we waited for the fried calamari. Second, no refills were offered for our soda. Third, our take-home boxes was missing one of the entrées which probably didn't get boxed in confusion. Finally, I realized that the Cheesecake Factory is one of those establishments that calculates the customary 15% gratuity on the dinner + the tax instead of correctly on just the dinner itself. Anyone of these service issues by themselves would not have been a big deal, but all of them combined made our dining experience less than special for us. The only thing saving the Mothers' Day lunch was that the food was delicious."}
{"text":"As the hype train is still roaring on since it's grand opening only a few short weeks ago, my friend and I opted for take-out instead of dining in. We waited about 30 minutes in total from start to finish to get our take out versus probably 1.5 hrs minimum to be seated. 

We ended up ordering the Red Velvet and Mango Key Lime cakes. The cakes themselves are quite something; tasty, moist and definitely lives up to their reputation. My friend mentioned that the cakes pale in comparison to the American counterpart, but is similar enough to warrant a pass. As good as the cakes are, for $9 a slice this is one experience I would recommend only once in a blue moon unless you are dying to unload your wallet for the sweet tooth fix."}
{"text":"It's a Cheesecake Factory.  Consistent food; inconsistent service.  Twice this month I've had to argue over the use of the gift cards for a piece of free cheesecake.  Folks should really read their own cards."}
{"text":"Yummie! Flavorful dishes indeed! Chicken in the gumbo was so tender and moist.....just melts in your mouth! If softer jasmine rice was used, it would have sure hit the spot! 

Chipotle pasta also had a rich taste, a sweeter dish with the maple chicken.

Portion sizes were large, doggy bag for sure. Service was friendly and attentive.

Worth the wait time for a table, but can be avoided if your coordinate with your mall shopping time.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had cheesecakes and drinks there, of course, variety and quality are great.
The service was a little disappointing. We arrived around 4pm on a weekday. And during the 1 hour we sat there, the server kept coming to ask us if we are still working on the cheesecake. We felt like they wanted to kick us out. It was weird. 
We looked around and there were lots of table available. 
So, to conclude, unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Pretty horrible service tonight, came out for my birthday dinner. We had to wait 45 mins to be seated which is understandable. But had to wait 15 to get water and bread and over an hour for our food. It took the waitress over 20 minutes just to bring us our card at the end. Really awful and kind of ruined my day. :("}
{"text":"The wait wasn't long to be seated. The wait to order and the wait for the food to be served was long. There was a fly on the table that took forever to leave. So while waiting for the food to arrive we try to get rid of the fly. The food was delicious. The cheesecake was good too."}
{"text":"It started out really bad.  After checking in with the hostess, we're told about 10 mins wait and was asked to wait behind the counter.  Twenty-five minutes had passed and as we look around everyone that was waiting before us, including those that came after us, were seated except our party. It was then I've decided to come up to the counter where the manager Ahmad where standing and waited patiently for my turn to speak to him (he was talking to the hostess). He never even bothered to ask if I needed anything... he knew I was there and yet he continued to ignore me while he acknowledged this woman who just walked up to him. So, I finally asked  how much longer do we need to wait before we get seated.  Much to our surprise, they couldn't find our ticket.  My wife and I were furious at that point.  Glad we had Alicia as our server.  She asked how our day was and we told her what just happened.  Apparently, she told another manager,Greg, what happened. Greg approached us immediately, he listened and was very apologetic, and offered us an appetizer.  We politely declined but expressed that we were grateful he came and spoke with us.  Overall, what started as a bad experience turned to a very positive one..... Kudos to Alicia who was very attentive and gave us 5 star service."}
{"text":"I find this place to be really hit or miss with the service. Mainly miss. I've only been seated on the patio as that's always my preferred seating area. I'm not sure if they forget we're out there or what. The last time we were there my husband had to go inside to track down the server that was found standing there watching TV, literally just standing there watching TV WTH? While we were waiting for this guy and waited long enough to feel the need to track him down. The food is okay and the crabcakes are actually very good. My potatoes were served but they were not hot or even close to warm. I told the server and his response was \"do you want another order to take home\" I think by the time I got them home they might be cold again? And I would have preferred them with my meal rather than a bedtime snack. But he only found they were cold as we were given the bill because he didn't come back after the food was served to see if everything was okay. 
Patio service is sub par.



Update/Last and final
The crab bites are what kept me coming back but I've determined today's experience isn't worth it. I got burnt crab bites served with no plates so I ended up eating off my bread and butter plate. I did ask the server, Isabelle H, for plates but she forgot. The hamburger sliders were put on a napkin before she finally realized we needed plates. Bad service and burnt food. This is an instance where your food can't even overcome bad service. 
I really wanted this outcome to be different but once again the outdoor dining service is a complete flop. Obviously burnt food actually served... I'm done."}
{"text":"I realize that the Cheesecake Factory is the type of establishment that people who love and care about food, GOOD food, tend to despise.

But I just can't bring myself to hate it!

Went here after work today.  First plus: Nelson's \"Love and Affection\" was playing on the speakers as I walked in, followed by other tunes of the late '80s and early '90s.  Second plus: we got seated right away. (it was actually quite comical; we walked up, gave our name, then as we were walking away we heard \"Jessica, party of two?\"  It was a bit stupid, but we laughed.  It's too bad they weren't doing that to be funny!)

Third plus was the service.  Our waiter was awesome.  We wanted for nothing.

The food was pretty good.  I had a really fresh, citrusy arugula salad and a frickin' enormous plate of pasta.  Then of course I had to have cheesecake.  Yum.

One hint to staff: you don't have to give me a separate bag for each item! I got a bag for my leftover meal, then a separate bag for the other piece of cheesecake I ordered to go, and finally, when I wanted to wrap up what was left of my own cheesecake, I got a third bag.  Watch it, guys! Be greener and stuff.

I was expecting the Cheesecake Factory to be out-of-your-mind expensive, but I was actually pleasantly surprised when the bill came.  

But can I mention that Legacy Village makes me feel queasy?  So many cars!  So many lights! I felt like I was going to have a seizure.  It doesn't have to be Christmas all year round, people."}
{"text":"Went in just for a quick appetizer and juat spend quality time with my mother and grandma, Which we ended up having the best server by the name of Tosha , shes very professional and hospitable. She catered to our every need and was also easily approachable ! If you visit this location please ask for her :D"}
{"text":"Not that great.......when we arrived they told us there was a 40 minute wait but we got called after 10 minutes which was nice. After 20 minutes, we were finally served our drinks and delicious bread and butter. Our food came about 40 minutes after we ordered which was pretty annoying. I had Salmon, mashed potatoes, and broccoli which was just ok. The salmon had a nice sear but was lacking a bit of seasoning. The mashed potatoes were amazing but the broccoli was cold and hard. My grandparents and aunt and uncle all had the avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts. They all liked the buffalo blasts but the avocado egg rolls were not so great. Then the complications happened, my aunt asked for ranch because she didn't like the blue cheese the buffalo blasts came with and my grandmother asked for a salad since she said the food was too greasy for her. We waited 20 minutes and got nothing, so we told the manager. Nothing either after 10 minutes. FINALLY, we got our ranch and salad and they told us sorry and didn't charge us for it. Overall, I wasn't impressed by The Cheesecake Factory so I don't really recommend it."}
{"text":"Always really busy so we waited about 15 minutes. Food was good, service was good, pineapple Mojito was really good. The only drawback is the noise level. It's SO LOUD. You can't even have a conversation without raising your voice."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time last night.  It seems like they still have some bugs to work out with being a new location, as this is definitely one of my least favorite Cheesecake Factory locations.

Food is good, however, both my food and my husband's food were cold.  I had the chicken soft tacos, which have good flavor.  They describe them as spicy, however, I didn't detect any spiciness to them.  Rice was overcooked and hard.  My husband had the Cheesesteak and his was cold as well.  We were in a hurry since we had to get somewhere, so we didn't say anything and ate our food.  We ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and we waited for 15 minutes before we finally just left.  How does it take 15 minutes to get a piece of cheesecake to go?  I tried flagging the other waitstaff down to check on my cheesecake and not one person glanced my way.

Our server didn't seem to be enjoying her job and only checked on us once right when we got our food.  After that, it took about 20 minutes for her to stop back again.   Will not be going to this location again."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple cheeseburger with bacon, tomato, lettuce, ketchup and mustard (sans the bun). I was brought a plate with a burger patty on it. Nothing else. I realize they have a menu larger than god's ego but if you can't do a simple burger right maybe you need to take out about 10 pages from your bulging at the seams menu and concentrate on a few specialties. They can't even get a burger right. Won't be going back. They should just stick to cheesecake, period."}
{"text":"Waited so long for a Cheesecake Factory to open in Canada! And only to be disappointed after our first visit. Waited almost 3 hours for a table. Fine. Because we were told 2.5 hours wait. Then our food took 45 mins to arrive, because they left our order. No apologies. Then we finally got to order our cheesecakes. Another 20 mins. Got our cheesecakes and asked for the bill and got our bill. Another 15 mins for the machine to arrive. We ended up in Yorkdale for just over 5 hours. Remember not to park your car in the underground lots when you eat here, cause it's only free parking for the first 5 hours."}
{"text":"It's in the right location. We used to get a Oreo cheesecake and head to Hofbrauhaus. It was very convenient.

And there is an awesome fountain to play at right in front of this."}
{"text":"Place is good, love the atmosphere  great location .sad the service is bad our waitress was hard to be found  food quality  poor I have the chicken Marcella my son hade Louisiana chicken  pasta was hard to chew no flavor sorry to say it I'm a food lover and I love to cook but the only good thing is the desserts  good I give you that"}
{"text":"We really like Cheesecake Factory, but eat there only on special occasions since it's so pricey. We also don't have one in Prescott, so we can only eat there when we go down the hill to Scottsdale. This trip we went there for dessert after eating dinner elsewhere. Great cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Servers are friendly & knowledgeable.  Service was smooth but not to quick. The portions, for what we ordered, were large and we took some home. Outside dining is a little noisy, because it faces 83rd ave, but tolerable. The noise did not interfere with conversation. I especially like the Calamari appetizer and of course the deserts."}
{"text":"HOLY SMOKES! 

Waited for 4 hours on a Sunday to get seating for 16 people. Overall, I think this place is super overhyped, but that doesn't mean it wasn't amazingly delicious!!

I want to start off by saying that the portions are humongous! With my group, we all paired up with someone and ordered 1 main and 1 cheesecake. Prices are quite high but honestly, for the experience, I think it is kind of worth it. Definitely not a restaurant you would go to consistently, but for an amazing treat, I would for sure recommend. 

I ordered the Alfredo with Chicken and it was delicious! If i'm being super critical, I would say that the noodles are a bit too al dente and the chicken is a bit dry. Pretty plain meal to be honest, and very expensive. 

Had the celebration cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake. Humongous!!! Good ratios with cheesecake, cake and icing. 

Had the fried macaroni and cheese as an appetizer and lemme tell u guys. It was 4 small balls. LOL. 4 balls for $20. BUT I GOTTA SAY THOSE WERE SOME SUPER DELICIOUS BALLS GUYS!! Will definitely try to burger topped with fried macaroni and cheese next time. 

SO KEY POINTS :
- not that affordable
- big portions
- good for sharing
- awesome atmosphere and overall experience"}
{"text":"It is tough to find a restaurant with a 20 page menu.  Even tougher to find one that does it ALL exceptionally well.  

I've been here dozens of times and never, EVER, had a meal that wasn't great.

I haven't been much in the last few years because I really try to stay away from chains but went back again for the first time in at least two years last week.  Friggin awesome as usual.  In the past, the only part of their food that I wasn't in love with was their shoestring fries, and they no no longer offer them.  YES!  My meal came with normal perfectly cooked and seasoned fries.

The Navajo chicken sandwich is SO GOOD.  Pastas - SO GOOD.  Also, this might sound lame, but their chicken fingers are outstanding.

If you or your date are ever not sure what type of food you want, go here.

The selection and quality are unbelievable.  So is the service.  5 stars all the way around."}
{"text":"Good cheesecake, long lineup. You can drive down to the states, walk into a Cheesecake Factory, sit down, eat, pay your bill, drive back up in the same amount of time."}
{"text":"It took them forever to get our orders Although they are not busy. We waited atleast 20 minutes for Our drinks. 

We ordered calamari and it was very salty, we only ate few bites. 

The food we ordered with sauce are good. 

It took us almost 2 hrs of stay there because the service was sooooo slow

Our server is nice but have unpleasant odor.

We wont come back"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick snack and drinks. Sat at the bar.  Bartender was extremely friendly and helpful. The food is always excellent. And the portions are huge.  We always split an appettizer and an entree between the two of us. And we still have leftovers for lunch the next day. Always. Must hit stop on any trip."}
{"text":"Ok this is not a review on the actual location since I have never been to that location.  I had decided last week that I wanted to go there because I wanted a particular cheesecake I had before.  I called them up and asked if they still offered it.  The guy on the phone seemed very rushed but said yes.  So I was planning on going today for dinner and called again.  This time I was transferred to the bakery department.  They told me no that they do not offer that cheesecake anymore."}
{"text":"The menu has ads... That's pretty much the only negative thing I can say. The food is always spot on and very big. And cheesecake!"}
{"text":"A couple years ago, this place was good. I always loved coming here for the ambiance, and the food was always pretty awesome. Within the past year, though, I've had complaints, but still gave them chances to redeem themselves. But now, I don't think I'll be back for a while. 

During one visit, we had a group of six people. I don't know what was going on with our waiter, but he came to check on us maybe once after we got our food, and none of our drinks were ever filled. When it came time to drop off the bill, we were informed that gratuity was already added to the bill. In my experience, places only do this if your party is eight or larger. The only reason this pissed us off was because it then clicked in our heads, \"Oh, so that's why he didn't give a fuck about serving us. He's getting a fat tip anyway.\" And it's not like he was nowhere to be found. We saw him several times, checking on people around us, but could never get his attention. I only wish I could remember his name.

But what iced the cake was our last visit. My boyfriend ordered a burger, medium rare. When it came out, it looked good until he took a bite of it. The entire inside was raw. It was so disgusting, I couldn't even believe it. Our waitress seemed to agree, and she took it back for them to make a new one. Then a manager came and sort of apologized, asked if we wanted anything else. We're all modest and junk so we said, \"No, we're fine,\" but of course we were expecting they at least wouldn't charge us for the burger or, ya know, give us a coupon or something. Nothing. Guess they don't seem to care if the customer gets food poisoning because of their careless chefs. Not trying to sound like a freeloader, I just think it was a horrible business call. Anyways, it was enough for me to want to stay away for a while."}
{"text":"The host was very friendly, our waiter (forgot his name) I think ty was awesome! Our food delicious!! So While we where waiting to be seated which was very fast we saw the mango lime cake so we didn't think anything about it and decided to try it out, well not knowing it had coconut we freaked out cuz we have a child with allergies (epi pen needed) so it was a bit scary! 
But she is as fine she spit it out right way!! 
So I guess for families with food allergies it would be good to know ahead of the time!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here tonight for my daughter's birthday and they sang for her.  Food was great and the service was even better.  Try the Kilt Lifter on draught with fish n chips, very good.  Michael was tops."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday party and I will not ever be coming back with a large group. 
Problem #1: I called two weeks in advance and was told they don't make reservations for the time I was requesting and to come in 45 min early and I should be fine. I advised them it is a group of 20 and she said it was fine. Okay, so I came in 45 min early (4:15pm) and was quoted an hour by the manager. An hour and a half goes by and we are still waiting. I then speak to the manager and told him he quoted me an hour and it's well over an hour. He apologized and said we were waiting for another large party to leave because that's where we would be sitting and that he would have appetizers waiting for us. 

Problem #2: If you are telling people to just walk in with big parties then why don't you just take reservations to avoid getting slammed and you can prepare for it?! COMMON SENSE.

Problem #3: You shouldn't wait on a party to leave and expect them to leave in a timely manner because for all we know they can sit there and chat for another hour and you can't force them to leave!  
We finally got sat at 6:00 pm. The appetizers did come out about 10 minutes after we got sat which helped a little. The food seemed to take awhile but I get it was a big party, so kind of expected but the problem I had was my mom and little brothers food never came out. I advised the server and she's like it should be out shortly they are finishing up. Ummmm I actually don't even think they put their order in because my whole table was done eating and they were still waiting on their food! The manger came over and apologized AGAIN and said it would be take care of and gave my mom a free slice of cheesecake. I mean that's fine and all but my mom had to take her food to go because we were already there for 3 hours and everyone was ready to leave.
Honestly, worst service ever! Never coming here again and will take my large parties somewhere else. 
Cheesecake factory should allow reservations all the time. This will help and people will not have to wait foreverrrrr. 
OH and the least the manager could of done was give ME a free slice of cheesecake as it was my 25th birthday and we waited almost 2 hours to be sat! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Never been in this location but ordered to-go.  It was so nice to get home with everything we ordered with plastic ware. All warm food was warm and the cheesecake was cold.  Much appreciated for $90 in to-go food.  Love their lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my more \"high end\" dining out choices.  I know I can count on a special experience here when I take friends or family out for a special occasion.  The menu selections are endless !  But all are prepared with attention to the smallest detail.  The atmosphere is pleasant and upscale.  Every server I have had on numerous visits have been pleasant, positive and very attentive.  And, of course, there's the cheesecake...always a difficult decision - because they ALL are great !  Typically end up taking a slice home - the meal portions are large - usually enough for two meals.  The prices are very appropriate for the portions."}
{"text":"Just ate here and the waitress service was PHENONMINAL (Destiny), but when it came to the kitchen staff, the manager and the supply of food was ridiculous for a Valentines Day. You know its a holiday be prepared. Two of our fav. Items the cheeseburger egg rolls and the buffalo blasts were completely out, wouldnt you order extra of everything knowing this is Valentines day and also Las Vegas. Ordered our sons corndogs as soon as we sat down since he was fussy and we ordered the rest of our food 15 min later. All of our food came out before his three lil corndogs from the kids menu. The Manager Brandon did come over and apologize twice an apologized for the lateness but he stated that we make everything fresh. We had six in our party plus our son where all the other food that was ordered later came out.. Dont give people excuses just be honest and straight forward with what happened. I have been coming to the cheesecake for years and have never had an experience like this one. Way below expectations and the standard I know they have.

Wont be returning to this location if I do return to a cheesecake factory. I am a local to las vegas and was taking relatives from out of town to eat i guarantee that will not happen again at this location and potentially any cheesecake factory.."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. Matter of fact, I've never had anything less than a totally satisfying experience. And while you can't go here and not get dessert, the entree menu is large and its spectacular."}
{"text":"The place is okay. If they get too busy then don't expect them to go back and fourth all around you. The food is good though."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place. For 3 adults and 3 kids the price wasnt that bad. It looked well-kept. We got 2 Bacon- Bacon cheeseburgers which were big with some fries, the teriyaki chicken, a cheese pizza for one of the kids, grilled cheese sticks for another and mini corndogs for the last one. They were all good. The teriyaki chicken was a bit dry and needed a little bit more favor added to it, the pineapple that came with the chicken was super sour so wasnt touched after I tried it, the mini corndog meal for the kids were just three little things on a stick with a tiny bowl of fruit and that was gone in no time and the kid was still hungry. (News flash some kids eat more then others.. the kids menu goes from I wanna say 4 to 10 years old.. but that is too little for a 9 year old.. come on). The service could have been a little better we were sitting there a good 20 minutes before we could even get dessert. The kids hot fudge sundae was just two tiny ( barely there )scoops of icecream with a little bit of chocolate chips, and fudge on it and cost $3.50 ( again some kids can eat more). But besides all that. It was a very interesting place and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant in Yorkdale mall, its ambiance was pretty. The line to get inside was long - had to wait for 30-40min. There is a take out booth by the door which is convenient for some people. I got a whole red velvet cheesecake which never fails!"}
{"text":"Sheryl & Stephen are awesome!  4pm Happy Hour w/ them is fantastic & the crowd is very friendly.  Mostly locals.  I have to leave a new review because I had the Beet Salad for the first time here & I highly recommend it!  Super beautiful salad!  Mmm mmm!   

My friend got the Dynamite Shrimp & Spicy Chicken.  I tasted both & the only thing dynamite on both were the sauce on the side.  The batter on each were not spicy whatsoever.  My girlfriend got the Tomato Basil Flatbread & Adam's PB Chocolate Ripple Cheesecake & both were absolutely delish to share!!  I have to say the PB Cheesecake blew our socks off lol!  Wow!  The Reese's PB Cheesecake is mixed layers of cake upon Cheesecake so not an all Cheesecake FYI.  Mmm!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day this year. I haven't been since around 2010, and it was really good. I am a vegetarian, and there were plenty of options."}
{"text":"Came here at around 1pm on a Friday afternoon. Not crowded at all and was seated right away. Ordered avocado egg roll for appetizer and had 'Evelyn's Favorite Pasta' as my main. Ordered my pasta from their lunch special which is just a smaller portion off of their regular menu and for this particular one, it was only $2 less than regular. However, I thought the portion was still pretty good and I even had leftovers. Our server Jesse was attentive & came back twice to fill up our drinks. Would come back."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday for lunch, delicious, great service and we tried the stuffed chicken tortillas I think they are called and it was so delicious I kept eating from my sons dinner. I usually get the chopped salad from the sides menu and it is a really good sized salad with chicken and blue cheese.  It is $10.50 but can definitely be your meal and has just enough dressing to be light and you feel good after eating it, not over stuffed as it is easy to do here. The warm sourdough bread is awesome and I am not a bread fan whatsoever.  Our waitress was Brittney, an absolute beautiful young lady and she was very sweet. We love this place and have never had a bad thing to report. Just prepare to wait if you are in a vacation destination such as my hometown of San Diego or Hawaii. Very busy and popular."}
{"text":"The food we had was good. I had the filet mignon which was very good and cooked well. The mashed potatoes were cold and the green beans were cold and somewhat spicy. The other two in my party had shepherds pie and the bacon bacon burger and fries. They both enjoyed their meals with the exception of the fries which were sub par. The reason for the 3 stars is that the heaters on the patio were not on in warming mode and were emitting and foul rotten egg smell and our table as well as another table had to complain and the staff really struggled with getting it figured out. Our server Daisy was great!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Me and my family went on Wednesday for some drinks at the bar at our server Bria was spot on! And I mean PERFECT! Even when I had a problem she fixed it quick and made it happen! Thanks so much Bria! We'll be back for some more cheesecake! :)"}
{"text":"I went for lunch during birthday week, my lunch mates got salmon- big and looked awesome!  I tasted the fettuccine  alfredo- much too garlicky  and I like garlic! I had the luau chicken- perfect and this time they had pineapple  upside  cheesecake,  hooray!! Awesome"}
{"text":"Don't understand the fuss over poor service! My boyfriend and myself have been here several times and love the workers who know us by name. They are understanding and provide us with knowledge on the food options so we know what works best for us. Best environment, staff, and food in the valley! Would recommend to anyone who loves variety."}
{"text":"The best part of our visit was that the server was pretty attentive.  The worst part is that we had to send one of the meals back.  The cheese sauce on the mac-burger tasted bad.  This is something that the person who ordered it has apparently had many times at other CF's, and he said that the sauce on this wrong tasted bad, as in spoiled.  The server was nice and took it off our check."}
{"text":"This is the best location I've ever been to of the franchise. The bread is always warm, the service is outstanding, and the food is always very consistent. The vibe isn't the stereotypical vibe of a Cheesecake Factory, it's lively, fun, and caring."}
{"text":"Huge menu selection to satisfy anyone. This location always packed at prime hours. Servers are okay. Sometimes a little inattentive on checking on you. Food is yummy like all the places in the chain. Portions are big so eat half and save room for dessert. The cheesecake is super rich so eat half and save for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Good food with great service.  Plates are large and the offers way too many choices but once we waded through it were very pleased."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and has a relaxed and casual atmosphere. Everything on the menu tastes great and they even have a healthy menu although overall this place isn't the healthiest if you're watching your calories. Mostly comfort food but it's delicious.

I want to add that the service here is awesome! I went here 4 or 5 times now and every time the service has been phenomenal. The staff is super friendly and genuine. They are also very receptive and come around very quickly to make sure you are taken care of.

The only reason I'm taking off a star is because the cutlery was always just placed on the bare table which isn't the most sanitary thing. I would have preferred rolled up cutlery or at least placed on top of a napkin.

Aside from that it's a great place to eat while staying in Vegas.

Oh, one last thing. If you sit on the entrance side be prepared to listen to the zeus monologue or whatever it is in the mall area lol. It gets loud and you can actually feel the heat coming from the flames that accompany this presentation."}
{"text":"Went here for me and my boyfriends anniversary and it was so awesome. Our waiter, Joe, was honest with me when I asked him what his favorite cocktails were, and his favorite entree. He recommended the pineapple mojito which was delicious and the shepherds pie, which was probably one of the best meals I've had out to eat ever! Awesome service and food :)"}
{"text":"Went here with my parents after a long morning walk. Service was great, food was great. Dad and I had the crispy chicken sandwich with chipotle, he had fries and I had onion rings. Mom had special.... small sandwich with salad and potato soup. The fries and chicken sandwiches were excellent! The potato soup was the best mom had had at a restaurant. The salad was good as was her sandwich (turkey, I believe). The onion rings were ok but had a lot of batter and not a lot of onion. I would get the fries next time. If you're able to stay for the \"moving statue\" show, totally worth it. Loud but really good atmosphere and plenty of people watching."}
{"text":"Yes the line-up is crazy, but as soon as we got in and seated the experience was great! We loved the food and I was happy that I could have some for lunch the next day it was so tasty. I had a chicken mushroom dish, and my friend the spicy orange chicken. Mmm so good! I splurged on my diet and ordered a carrot cheesecake and it was the best cheesecake and probably piece of cake I've ever had. I can't wait to go there again, just hopefully when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Ups and Downs!

Our party of six was seated in less than 10 minutes.  WIN!

We weren't assigned a waiter and had menus but no beverages for 20 minutes.  FAIL!

We were really happy off of mai tais and margaritas they let us bring into the restaurant.  WIN!

We tagged 2 waiters and the second one brushed us off with, \"Oh, they'll be with you soon.\"  FAIL!

The manager found us and genuinely and thoroughly apologized, and offered to comp our desserts.  MEGAWIN!

We were assigned the second waiter that gave us the bullshit answer.  PWNAGE!

Ordered buffalo wings which were a perfect match of spicy and sour, and spinach+artichoke dip that came with chips instead of bread as usual.  WIN!

The 5 desserts we tried:
- Peanut Butter Cheesecake: Very very heavy.  Tastes like sugared up peanut butter and not for the weak of heart.
- Carrot Cake: Very classic, hard to go wrong but not spectacular.  Desserts are obviously overpriced at TCF but they don't skimp you.  Calorie for calorie you get what you pay for and the cakes are all a couple inches taller than the cheesecakes.
- Oreo Cheesecake: Not bad, hard to go wrong.
- Red Velvet Cheesecake: OMG sooooo good.  This was an unexpected combination for me.  The only thing I can think of is that the amount of cream cheese frosting can be overwhelming but other than that it's a really yummy dessert.
- Bowl of Fresh Strawberries: For $6.50 you get 10-15 strawberries.  Scam!  But for free it was a good combo with each of the cheesecakes.  If you have money to blow I would highly recommend getting this with any cheesecake order."}
{"text":"I went to this location , I will come back only for the best costumer service I got , my server LORLEN , she amazing , she's very classy the way she serve like 5 stars service , The food was very good , will come back for sure"}
{"text":"I wanted to take advantage of half price cheesecakes day and enjoyed a dine-in meal.  After thumbing through the book of a menu, I decided to save room for the cheesecake and ordered the small sizes chicken sliders and zucchini fries along with happy hour Mojito (my favorite mixed drink)! Even their small portions are sufficient! After eating that meal, I was so stuffed that I didn't eat my cheesecake until the next day! Whew, their food is fresh and awesome! The cheesecake was delicious btw and well priced! If you have a big appetite, you will enjoy their variety, fresh food and cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was a little slow as the place was packed, highly recommend making a reservation even if it is during the week...we went there on a wed night and we had to wait for 20min and then they messed up and some other ppl took our table so we had to wait longer. The waiter was nice, but you can tell he gets irritated when we ask questions since it was so busy and he prob had other things he needs to do...we had the eggroll sampler, the chicken sandwich and pineapple shrimp, and my daughter really liked her bowtie alfredo. All the food was great with generous portions, next time i go i will be sure to make a reservation"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their cheesecakes always hit the spot. It's hard for me to pick a favorite, but I really like the raspberry lemon, s'mores, and pumpkin cheesecake! The veggie burger is really good thanks to the grilled onions in the patty, but as soon as you take a bite it starts breaking apart. We went on my birthday and they sang Happy birthday & brought a complimentary sundae. I guess they don't do the free cheesecake anymore? The service was ok."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check this branch of the chain out right before I left for the military. There was a slight wait but they got us a table almost immediately which was great! 
Our waiter was really sweet and took care of us, definitely a plus in my book. Rude waiters are no fun. 
The food was good and came out in relatively good time. Our waiter set us up with some drinks and he checked in with us regularly. 
Next time I'm back home I'll definitely be stopping by!"}
{"text":"$15 for a child's bow tie pasta and $5 for lemonade?  Wow you guys have gotten ridiculous."}
{"text":"I went here last week with my son for lunch. My suggestion no less. I just remember that years ago it was very good. Not so much this time. 
We were seated in the bar area which was fine it is just that the table was very small. Barely held the drinks and the plates. We had two of the small appetizers, the corn fritters and the fried artichoke hearts. They were both very good. This is why I have to at least apply the second star. Now I can only speak for my lunch but it was inedible. I ordered the lunch Chicken Picatta. I knew as soon as it was set in front of me something was not right. The chicken was a shade of white like I have never seen before. I took a bite anyway, It was retched, I spit it right out. I thought maybe it was me, tried a second bite. Again same terrible spoiled taste. The only person I saw who worked there was the bus boy, I told him the chicken was bad. He promptly took my plate. He came back after a few minutes to tell me the manager would be over and they were cooking another one for me. I told him no thanks, just the thought of chicken was making me sick. The manager came over to ask me what was wrong. I explained, she was behaving as though she did not believe me. Starts telling me that they get fresh food every other day. I am not saying they don't, but the damn chicken was bad. She states maybe it is the capers, NO i have had capers a million times, I did not even put a caper in my mouth. I told her that I was being very discreet regarding this and did not cause a scene. She asked if I would prefer something else, I ordered a plain burger. When the burger arrived it was fine. 
What bothers me the most is that they were acting like I was making this up. Second my son and I ate in shifts. I do not see my son enough to want to have our lunch together ruined and eaten in shifts. 
When I got the check, my son asked if they removed the chicken charge, they did, he asked if they charged for the burger, they did. He was pretty pissed about this stating i should not have been charged for the burger. 
At this point I was over the Cheesecake Factory, and will never be heading back."}
{"text":"This place was super busy! Kind of wish it wasn't part of the mall. It has potential to be a nice romantic spot or a more quiet intimate spot for a dinner. The tables are so small, the place seems cramped. There were so many people breaking dishes and dropping things on accident because of the tables, or lack there of, I mean... the tables are pretty small... Sheesh! But this place has potential!!! The food was pretty good! Their Caesar salad was okay... I was pretty spoiled with Rare's Caesar salad."}
{"text":"My hope was high but was quite disappointing, for a wait that was longer then 2 hours, food LOOKS good with decent sized plate, decor was great service wasn't bad at all especially in a place that was this busy BUT!!!!!!!  After all people are there for the food and the taste was HORRIBLE!  Steak were as tough as my eraser, pasta was over cooked so it turns into mush, taste was blended.  After all, the place was named \"Cheesecake Factory\" although their food weren't too good but the Cheesecake was pretty good let alone the selection was endless which all in itself worth an extra star."}
{"text":"Five stars for being my go to cheesecake spot. With curbside service, all the selections and close proximity to my house, I go here all the time for desert. Why only 3 stars? Way too many menu items, overpriced dinner menu and execution of their dishes. The pasta is never sauced or buttered and sticks together. The taco's are just OK and none of their other dishes I have tried have impressed, other than the steak and scampi combo (which is garlicky and delicious). With all the other great and unique places to eat in the city, this is my last choice for dinner."}
{"text":"Food was great, but unfortunately we experienced a rude server and had to wait to be seated at another section after asking to move. After 45 mins we were finally re-seated and had a great server named Brittany H. Spoke to the manager about the incident with the first server and he did not do anything."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday afternoon, the wait time was about 30-40 minutes which was awesome. Only downfall about it was the buzzers limit where you're able to walk within the mall. Our server was very nice and attentive. We ordered off the lunch menu given the time we were there and I have to say the portion sizes were pretty big and I was satisfied with what I got in the Louisiana Chicken pasta, the cheese cake was great although it was a little pricey but otherwise a great first experience here. Will definitely be looking forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"I'd recommend breakfast at CF.  I've had the french toast twice now and it is delicious!  The portion is huge and it could easily be shared.  One of my other dining companions had the monte cristo sandwich which was also fabulous!  Reasonably priced and good service."}
{"text":"For my birthday my fiance and I decided to check out The Cheesecake Factory and we had a wonderful experience from the time we arrived! I knew from reading other yelpers reviews to expect a wait so I was totally prepared for waiting and to my pleasant surprise our quoted wait time of 15 minutes went by fast while we looked over there enormous menu. The time finally arrived for us to be seated (patio) and our waitress Emily was very friendly and also very knowledgeable of the menu. Upon her suggestion I ordered the Jamaican Pepper Shrimp and Chicken with black beans, rice, and fried plantains. All of which was delicious. My only complaint would be the temperature of my was not very hot. My guy had the rib eye and fries and he devoured Evey bite! I ordered the 30th Anniversary cheesecake to go because my entree was sooo big but that's a good thing. You guys helped make my day that much more special and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, but I had a craving for hot wings.  Those wings were huge! blue cheese chunky, buffalo sauce was good. Love the bread, love the cleanliness of the restaurant.  I def be back"}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory and our server Brittany was the best! We had the Cuban rolls which were amazing! If you want good food and great service come to this location."}
{"text":"Where to begin? We arrived at 3:00 pm on Sunday afternoon.  There were 9 of us.  We were told it would be a 40 - 45 minute wait because they do not do reservations.  At the 1 hr. mark I asked how much longer it might be and was told they were waiting for a final table to pay and leave to allow the staff to create our spot.  At 1 hr. 20 min I again asked how much longer and was told they were getting the table set up for us.  This amount of time is not acceptable!  I realize it's their policy to not take reservations, because, let's face it, they are always full and people are obviously more patient than we were.  Clearly this is a place that is not geared towards groups greater than 6.  DO NOT GO to one of these if there are more than 6 of you, and only if you want to all fit into a booth.  Otherwise, you will be waiting way too long.  Honestly, I think they forgot about us.  We were not given a beeper until we'd been there an hour and complained.  

In a way to mitigate our ire, they comped us with 2 appetizers.  Remember, there were 9 of us.  I think they should have comped us at least 4.  If we'd been a party of 4, they would've given us at least 2, I'm sure.  

I will say, our server was outstanding, and if not for him, it would have been a completely wasted evening.  Yes, I said evening; because, while we arrived at 3:00, we weren't seated until 4:30 and we didn't leave until almost 7:30.  And that's not because we dallied over our meal.  It was not an experience I'll ever have again.  This will be my second and last visit here.

Oh, by the way, the food was mediocre, and much too expensive for nothing more than high-end fast food,  

This is a review that's all about the service.  The food is secondary, and the service was horrendous.  There're plenty of places you can go that will treat you better and provide you with much much better food at this price point.."}
{"text":"Even though seating can be an issue, The Cheesecake Factory is always clean, organized and orders come in a timely fashion. Staff is kind and courteous. It's a bit loud inside for a lunch time unless of course you are looking for a quieter dining experience. Prices are a bit on the high side for a regular visit but for special events this is the perfect place!"}
{"text":"Tonight I took my girlfriend out to dinner to the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park. We arrived early and there was no wait. We were quickly seated in a dim lit booth. After searching over the 16 page menu we finally ordered edamame and calamari for appetizers to pick at before our entree arrived. They came out fairly quickly and were great. I ordered the orange chicken and was quite satisfied. My girlfriend ordered shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Both of the meals were largely portioned.  We were too stuffed to order dessert. But I have had their pumpkin pecan cheesecake and it's delicious. Overall, I would return there again and recommend it to anyone seeking a good meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.Although it be been there a few times but I can't order anything but the \"Da Vinci\" pasta, with chicken and mushroom. The bread is also a reason enough to go there with a combination of fresh homemade bread. The main attraction is the cheesecakes of course but don't let the name fool you; their menu is as good as the cheesecakes (so be easy on the bread if you want to save room for dessert!). Service is ok but seeing how busy the place always is, you can't expect fast service but they are efficient and friendly enough. My personal favorite cheesecake is the white chocolate, but I'm sure you will have your own..."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch after a day at the zoo!  Amazing portion sizes, great tasting food, and an updated, sizable new menu. I had a hard time choosing what to eat but eventually settled on a chicken piccata dish. It was amazing, the lemon sauce was to die for, and it came with three huge chicken pieces. Finished up with a piece of Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The wait was terrible...waiting to sign in to wait is asinine. The waitress was like a roller coaster....one second she was a good peak and then she was a bad valley. Like always it was a $100+ meal that should have been $25 due to the failure to fill drinks, bring hot food and the length of time that it obviously took to make the cheesecake. Thank heavens that I don't live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I had a nice experience visiting the Cheesecake Factory for the first time ever.

The restaurant itself is beautiful and even though it was crowded I found the atmosphere to be cozy. Everything that I ordered here ended up being excellent from the appetizers to the dessert, so I was pleased about that.

It is somewhat expensive, but I think it would be worth going to on special occasions."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for drinks. Food came out cold. The server was not having a good day.....plastic in my sons pasta! Couldn't get an extra chair because of a \"fire hazard\" ok then let your guest stay standing!!!!!!!! I'm not leaving here happy...."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here had the state and it was delicious has the warm crab and artichoke dip that was excellent the bread they give you the pumpernickel is so good my wife had the Caesar salad with grilled chicken and my mother in law has the state Diane from scampi and we're going to finish it off with the red velvet cheesecake also the strawberry lemonade is excellent will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The selection is overwhelming and I couldn't decide which cheesecake I wanted. I ended up ordering 2 slices for me and 2 slices for my husband. We had our dog out in the car and I asked the folks at the counter if they had anything dog friendly and they put whipped cream in a plastic cup for him! (Our order was to go.) Shoutout to Jelani B. (Jay) and Luz H. For your pawsome service!"}
{"text":"Normally very busy. I usually sit at the bar or grab a slice of the White Chocolate Red Velvet cheesecake. The wings are good, but that's only as far as I've went eating wise. I can't remember the name of the bartender but she made a good margarita! Drinks and Cheesecake are my go to."}
{"text":"You can't really mess up wine & bartenders friendly, but we kept getting a whiff of a dirty sink smell that made our visit shorter.  Love the location."}
{"text":"Busy location but the surroundings are interesting enough to keep you busy while you wait for a table. Aquarium in the Caesar's Forum shopping centre is a good place to sit.

The wait for lunch was only 10 minutes and the service was friendly and quite helpful, with advice offered on customizing our orders - the advice turned out to be well worth it.  Our meals were served in a timely manner and they were delicious.  A very good Cheesecake Factory location that is worth visiting just for the surroundings. The standard Cheesecake Factory decor really blends well with the Roman setting of Caesar's Palace.

I know its a chain, but it is a good one with a great variety of tasty meals that allows you to satisfy everyone in your party with individual choices."}
{"text":"Stopped at Biltmore Cheesecake Factory on my way home from Mesa to Surprise.  I ordered from the take out, Chicken Maderia without mushrooms, still want the sauce just no mushrooms because I don't like the texture of mushrooms.
I knew by the time i got home I was going to reheat it.
I opened it and sadly saw the best part missing the sauce!
Bummed I reheated it for 20 minutes.  The potatoes were still not cook at all!  They were hard as a rock.  Tried cooking it longer and just pitched the potatoes.  Then took a bite of the chicken and it was undercooked!  
So overall it sucked!"}
{"text":"great restaurant. large caesar salad with a perfect garlic dressing. great menu with lot of food. I like this location."}
{"text":"I went on September 12, 2017 @ 7:00. After using the free valet service I walked into the restaurant and asked about sitting outside for 1. The lady up front said it would be a 10 minute wait. I said ok I'll wait. Once I was called and seated outside. The waitress kept walking by 15 times with only 2 other parties outside at the time. At this point I was getting pissed. But I continued to wait till a lady finally Came (can't remember her name) and took my food & drink order. Once my food came out she never came by to check on me and by this time there was only 1 other party seated outside. I kept waving her down but she never stopped to see what I needed. After a haft hour I finally was able to get her and asked about getting a Togo box and the dessert menu. 20 minutes went by no Togo box or dessert menu. Another 20 minutes went by finally she brings me the menu and Togo box. Then another 20 minutes she finally came back and took my dessert order for Togo. She immediately brought me my bill and told me the order for the cheesecake is in it will be about 5 minutes. Well 5 minutes turned into a 50 minute dessert for Togo. Finally left the restaurant at 9:30. 

I did come into contact with a manger (heavy guy) that could care less. He pretty much said here's the corporate number have a great day. 

Come on 2 hours of just sitting and receiving bad service? NEVER AGAIN. CORPORATE WILL BE CONTRACTED."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Thursday night on a business trip. We were across the street the night before for German food and I saw The Cheesecake Factory!  Couldn't wait.  Sat down in a booth by the bar, watching the Chicago Bears Pre-Season game, drinking a Sam Adams Octoberfest in mid August. Our waitress was awesome; instead of ordering my favorite dish, Spicy Cashew Chicken I tried the Chicken Katsu. It's crispy fried over rice and spicy miso sauce, different but good. My co worker went with the spicy cashew chicken!  For dessert we both ordered the 30th Anniversary cheesecake. Definitely my top 5!"}
{"text":"It was our anniversary and we wanted to celebrate.  We don't eat out a lot.  We chose this restaurant for the dessert.  We have always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory in Rockville, MD.  The cheesecake is fresh and beautifully decorated.  They use the best ingredients and eating this dessert makes you feel decadent and special.  We were expecting the same from The Cheesecake Factory in South Park.  It didn't come close.  The dessert was stale and tasted as if they had make it from a box mix.   I don't mind paying $10.00 for a slice of cheesecake if it's baked by hand from scratch.  This was neither.  I am afraid that success has ruined this particular restaurant and I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This location is fine, but nothing special.

As always, the cheesecake is totally delicious. We have definitely come here before just to order cheesecake to bring home. 

Last night, we were able to sit outside, which was a bonus, but the service was only OK. Our app plate was never cleared throughout dinner and drinks were on the slow side. I had to ask for a second drink because our server never came around and asked. I've had better....I've had worse. 

I'm a big fan of the avocado eggroll app, so when we come here that's always a given. I've you've never had it, I really recommend it! It's one of the best things on their menu and the dipping sauce is delicious. I'm hungry just thinking about them!

I ordered the grilled fish tacos as my entree and they were pretty bland. There was no real flavorful sauce or even strong citrus flavor. They were fine, but I wouldn't order them again. 

Overall, it's a decent place to sit outside for drinks and some cheesecake. The atmosphere is nice and it wasn't too loud."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in. The restaurant was pretty steady. We had our name taken down. It was about a 10 minute wait which was great. We were then seated at our table, only to be given one set of silverware. We decided not to say anything right away to see if they had noticed. Our waitress takes our drink order minutes later not noticing we only had one set of silverware. My friend then asked for silverware and straws. The waitress thought she heard us ask for more bread. And we quickly said no and my friend repeated herself. After that, she then takes our order, my friend orders a Louisiana Chicken Pasta and I order a Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. My waitress then proceeds to ask if I wanted to fries with my meal. Confused, I said sure why not. We had been here now for an hour now, when they finally bring our food out. My friend got what she ordered but it was cold. I was brought a Spicy Chicken Sandwich, which is not what I ordered. Confused, I told the server I didn't order that. She said ok and that she would be right back. Then proceed to ask our waitress what I ordered and the waitress said, \"I swore she ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and not the pasta\". Normally a waitress, would read back what we order to make sure it was correct. She didn't and said she probably misheard me. They brought out the pasta only to realize that the noodles are under cooked because they most likely rushed due to the fact that the waitress messed up my order. I'm disappointed. I come often with family and friends for events and haven't had this happen before. I won't come back any time soon and hopefully when I do this doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"Great experience here tonight! Located in Forum Shops in Caesars Palace, this place seemed a bit quiet compared to the CF at home in San Diego. 

We ordered all appetizers: Avocado Eggs Rolls (my favorite--always amazing), Tex-Mex Egg Rolls, roasted artichoke, fried chicken sliders and a  combo of fried avocado, zucchini & portobello mushrooms. Great service from Scott. Food was awesome & we had great cocktails too."}
{"text":"Okay who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory? You can't go wrong here! Great atmosphere, great options for everyone and great portions! If you have a tough group to accommodate you can be sure to please everyone here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dessert, Lemon Raspberry Creme Cheesecake....my tummy loves the Lemon!"}
{"text":"Today's visit to Cheesecake Factory was pretty disappointing. First of all we were sat by a hostess in a very busy area-the bar. Service was slow, but that was due to her being the only server for 10+ tables and getting sat over and over again. I didn't understand why we were sat there when there were other areas of the restaurant that were obviously not as busy. Our meal came out before the appetizer, which was cold by the time it reached our table. It didn't taste good and we did not eat it but they still charged us for it, even though we told our server it wasn't good. She was obviously too busy when she couldn't even process what we were telling her. The area was loud and she had way too many people to take care of. Our bill was $31 and I put $40 cash in the book but she never came around to pick it up and bring change so after what we felt was way too long we just left. Great tip for bad food and service. We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This review is for the oreo cookie milkshake and key lime cheesecake very good....Nom Nom Nom"}
{"text":"Stellar service! Went in for National Cheesecake Day for 1/2 price cheesecake and they did not disappoint! We went in late to avoid the crowds though it did a little while still to get our cheesecakes since many ppl were still seated, I'm sure getting their desserts. But once they arrived at our table all was forgotten. These cheesecakes have the most delectable flavors. I couldn't care less what their calorie content is. Everything in moderation and this is the perfect place to splurge! 

The flavors of every single piece was ABSOLUTELY perfect! I'm not much of a S'mores fan but these flavors blended so well from the sweet light crunchiness of the graham cracker crust to the delicious light airy Hershey's chocolate cheesecake to the rich chocolate ganache topping and toasted housemade marshmallow. Kahlua is my usual choice for cheesecake and was spectacular as usual. My son ordered Hershey's Chocolate Bar and it too was delicious and he even had leftovers for me to enjoy the next day! Love love LOVE!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service was good.. We ordered three appetizers.  Avocado roll, tex-mex roll and quesadilla.  The tex-mex rolls seemed a bit over cooked and burnt. The. Waiter was attentive and helpful. His name was James.  At the last minute I couldn't resist a slice of Oreo cheesecake.  That was good."}
{"text":"The hostesses  at this location were absolutely terrible, but our fantastic server made up for it. She was very energetic and was on top of topping of beverages and such. Their serving sizes are ridiculous,  so if you don't like leftovers, order the lunch portion. I was also disappointed that a Virgin Strawberry Daiquiri was the same price as an alcoholic one, but oh well."}
{"text":"Great service.  Avacado egg rolls bere fantastic.  I just eat the insides...pure avacado heaven.  Chicken picatta was very good with plenty of big freshly sliced and sauted mushrooms.  Love the dark bread in the basket too.  I'm stuffed!  No cheesecake tonight."}
{"text":"I use to work at Boca Park and never ate here, but recently I decided to give it a try... several times. 

The bacon truffle cheese sticks are in my order every single time.

I've tried a couple of different burgers. All were seasoned very well and cooked perfectly.

Their cheesecake is great, but the best option is the Oreo cheesecake. 

I ordered delivery so I'm not sure what it's like inside of the restaurant, but I'm sure the food is probably even better without the long ride for delivery."}
{"text":"We love the factory. And thought we would try this new one. ( been here twice now) The menu and restaurant is always nice. 
The service was ok. The server did come over to be a bit grumpy, and slow sometimes. but may have been a bad day for him.  the food is always nice, and the atmosphere is always good. 
My only comment is that it can be dark at some tables, so can be difficult to read the menu.

Other than that. A great place and we will be back."}
{"text":"Starting with the good! I love love love the cheesecake and the variety in both entrees and desserts. You always get plenty of food for the price which isn't going to break your pockets. The staff is always nice, attentive, and quick. That's where the good ends.

In the past I frequented this place like every other weekend but as of last year that is not the case. I hate to say this is no longer my favorite place. Cleanliness has become a issue. Barely wiped tables/ seats and crumbs on the floor are too obvious for me to ignore. The food has become very inconsistent and can sometimes be sent back a couple of times before satisfactory or just giving up on the dish completely. 
It can be super busy so reservations would be nice but that isn't a big deal if you don't mind waiting. 
Overall its just decent at best now with exceptional cheesecake and good service."}
{"text":"Went at 6pm and though it was packed we were seated in 5 min. Staff was friendly and attentive. Our server Grant was very good!! Food was delicious and portion sizes were good."}
{"text":"Our server Edgar was funny and great. New app Parmesan Garlic cheese bread was awesome."}
{"text":"I already warned by my coworker about the bad service of this location but I said to myself everybody deserve a second chance. Yesterday 07/16/17 I ordered factory burrito grande over the phone at 12:13pm and I was told that it would be 15 to 20mins so I went there 5mins early and payed for my order. For a sunday the place not crowded yet because theres no waiting time to be seated for a dining customer. 25mins had passed still my order not ready yet. So I asked the cashier politely \"can i follow up my order its been 25mins now?\". She said \" I will ask the other cashier what's the status\"? and never return back to me . Now its more than 30 of waiting, I approached a manager whats going on? He said let me follow up with that , as I looked at him walking towards the kitchen a fellow employee talk to him and forgot bout my order. This location is very disorganize and lack of sense of urgency regarding customer waiting for a long time. i always order food from the ceasars palace brance but their service are always good!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go. Had the Parmesan herb crusted chicken, was delicious! Besides the food, the best service by Patricia D. Always a smile on her face, knew the right time to come to table, wasn't pesky. She made the dining experience that much better."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory never fails to let me down. I went came here the other night after a long day, so excited for the food. We were seated right away and had the best waiter, I wish I could have gotten his name. He was so friendly and diligent with refills. 

I love the Skinnylicious menu and all the options it has. It has a great variety with saving those extra calories for the cheesecake! I got the skinnylicous burger that came with a garden salad. I was very impressed with how quickly the food came out, being it was around 6:30 in the evening. The burger tasted very fresh and was cooked perfectly. The salad was very good. Whatever skinnylicious dressing they use, I wish I had a bottle of it at home! So good! The Cheesecake menu never fails to let me down. I always have to narrow down my picks. I went with the Reese's cheesecake. Amazing. Such a great way to indulge.

I would come back again, for sure!"}
{"text":"Im here Johnathan M... a wonderful server... look yall, i came in here with major dizziness ... blood sugar was super low.. he gave me a basket of fries right away.  He suggested dishes that were amazing ans checked on my very often.. im not one to ever order desserts.. but i had to show my appreciation for this place. Johnathan is very informative and amazing!! What a lovely experiemce.. living here in vegas... im so running back to the strip for lunch often.. cheese cake... yall did good, Johnathan is wonderful"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory may be my favorite restaurant chain.  I've been to different locations here and in L.A., but I'm a regular at this location now.   

The menu is very diverse, and regardless of location, the meals are always well-prepared.  I've tried many of their dishes, and have never been disappointed in one. 

I like to go to The Cheesecake Factory when I want to celebrate, so I usually get a bottle of wine or Champagne or just a couple of martinis.  I try to find a reason to celebrate something at least once a month.  

After dinner and drinks, I like to cap the celebration with coffee and -- of course -- cheesecake."}
{"text":"Stopped here while at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  The service is very slow at this location and burger was delivered undercooked after giving specific instructions to my server for well done preparation. I hope more staff will be hired and trained to become better communicators so future patrons will not have a poor experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while bike riding. Sweet corn tamale cakes appetizer is amazing. Delicious! I had the veggie burger with sweet potato fries and it was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. My hubby had the fried chicken sliders. Both great. We were too full for dessert. Service was amazing. Even though it's a chain, the food and service are impeccable."}
{"text":"I always like this place. The food quality is consistent and the service is worth a 20% gratuity. I enjoy loud restaurants that buzz, so Cheesecake delivers every time .

Menu is overwhelming at times, so I find myself sticking to my faves, such as chicken potstickers, bathing in a sweet soy sauce and black toasted sesame seeds. Depending on our hunger level, farfella with chicken and roasted garlic is full of flavor and perfect to share....a little more hunger and we dig into the spicy cashew chicken over white rice. I would stay away from the burgers, nothing special there.

It's a hit or miss if we order cheesecake, but when we do, it's usually the original cheesecake with strawberries....if the kids are with us, those chocolate lovers order the Godiva or red velvet cheesecake. Either way, they're all delish. 

If it's just the two of you and you don't want to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, ask to be seated at the bar or high tops...we usually get seated right away!"}
{"text":"Came here on New Year's Day, partly because it was one of the only places open. Had a very anti-climactic meal here. We ordered crab and artichoke dip, which they were out of, so we split the cheese and artichoke dip and a Chinese chicken salad. Both were just ok. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was sooooooo incredibly cloyingly sweet. 

Also, our server, though nice, left in the middle of our meal and the replacement server didn't come by for a solid 15 minutes. Eh. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"No different than any other Cheesecake factory. I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's an American staple and I adore it. This one was interesting because it had that absolutely bizarre fountain outside it and there was no wait. INCREDIBLE!"}
{"text":"Day 3...
Since we couldn't find Stage Deli at the Forum Shops we ended up here at the Cheesecake Factory at the Forum Shops. Maybe we needed a break from those expensive restaurants.

Didn't record our exact dishes but it was good and we had an attentive server.

Big, big servings! Come really hungry!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my coworkers and showed up at 11:10. It was not busy when we ordered, and the food we chose was not complicated either. We didn't get our food til 1220! Our waitress did not come up to check on us or give us an update on what was taking so long...anyway when the food finally came she said she was \"mad for us\" except she did nothing to fix the issue. I won't be returning. This place is over priced and has terrible service!"}
{"text":"We usually love the Cheesecake Factory, but lately not so much. We order two Cobb salads to go with ranch dressing on the side.  There must be a shortage on blue cheese because neither salad had any.  Blue cheese is the main thing I love about the salad and thought we had found the perfect place when the Cobb salad craving hits, like I said not so much. Next time tell me that you ran out of the ingredient so that I can change my order. If you had told me I wouldn't be so disappointed in you Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was very busy. Waited about 30 mins to be seated for a party of 6.  Not unexpected on the weekends at this location. Our waitress was really nice, she got our drinks and bread right away. I ordered the circumvent lemonade- very sweet and refreshing. I get it every time. I also ordered the buffalo blasts and bbq ranch chicken salad. If you like buffalo sauce and Bleu cheese- you should definitely try the buffalo blast. They are perfect and so the Bleu cheese is made in house and the perfect combo of creamy and chunky. The salad is like a southwest salad with black beans, corn, avocado grilled chicken and fried onion string. I was too full for a dessert, but super satisfied with my meal. One of my favorite brunch/lunch spots."}
{"text":"Dessert and coffee for me, dinner for Rob.  Really busy, but then it is Friday night.  The projected wait is only 10 minutes.  I need to remember a slice of cheesecake to bring home for Mom.  I had the Lemonchello torte and Rob had a Cuban sandwich.  I do like the atmosphere here.  I like the dark lighting in the evening.  They have a new menu and they finally have a lower calorie menu.  I guess after all the bad press on having the highest calorie items on any restaurant menu EVER, they finally got the hint.  I would like to go back and try some of the under 550 menu items."}
{"text":"The food is solid 5 stars, the service however is 3 at the most. Therefore, we'll split the difference and give this location 4 stars. The place is huge, two stories in fact, so it could easily accommodate a crowd. Food was great with huge portions, but like I said earlier the service was slow and the waiter was not attentive at all."}
{"text":"Usually have a nice time & meal, but today they seam to of had Sunday blues. They had no sugarless syrup when they said they do. They served an omelette that was incorrect. They dropped the onion rings on the floor. At least all the servers had their usual politeness. Hopefully they get through  the rest of today smoother than this morning."}
{"text":"We decided to go have our Easter dinner at the cheesecake factory tonight and I wish we wouldn't have.  Right away our server messed up the appetizer order, ok it happens, not too big of a deal. But it got messed up a second time. Then when our dinner was brought out the server never came back till everyone was almost done. My dinner was not good and I wanted to get something else. But I had to sit while my family are waiting for our server to come back. When she finally did, she questioned me on why I didn't like my food and if I had ever had it before....I had actually had it many times and was one of my favorite things. She became very rude after all that. Didn't bother apologizing. I had to wait another 15/20 min after everyone was done eating and paid for my meal to come out. The one thing that made this experience has was the rudeness of our server Alexandria T. I'm a server and I think one of the most important thing is to check back with your table to make sure everyone is happy. This could've been different if she had done that. At my restaurant when there's a problem, a manager always comes to the table....no manager bothered to talk to us. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Just another key chain with mediocre food mediocre service try the mushroom burger it wasn't too bad ordered it medium came out medium which is always a good thing smothered mushrooms and swiss not we'll just see but still pretty good not the best burger I've ever had not the worst either no average Burger had a side Caesar salad that suck Shredder butt is so small you can barely pick it with a fork and their Caesar dressing no flavor at all like I said everything's mediocre but restaurant that's open late night it's not bad better than Denny's yet more expensive than Denny's I prefer BJ's over Cheesecake Factory though may go back to the future and maybe maybe not who knows"}
{"text":"remember my first visit to a cheesecake factory 10+ years ago i was not impressed (different location of course). But every since I've taken the time out to visit this location they've been my new favorite , far as food goes!! service is Ehhh ! depending on who u ask ....recently went in for happy hour to enjoy and get better acquainted with the menu . Taking the chance to enjoy calamari , dynamite shrimp, crab artichoke dip, fried crab balls?, and one more item i can't quite remember. Everything was delicious for the most part ... oh yea stuffed mushrooms that came out cold... but dont worry they took them back and warmed them up before bringing them back for us to enjoy.Another issue i did have was noticing a couple with a kid who came in afterward, but receiving their drinks before we did ... but i took it out of his tip and made a  note of it , of course !!!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory was delicious. I expected it to be really expensive but it was one of the least expensive meals we had in Vegas. The only downfall for me was that you couldn't reserve a table and had to queue and stand around waiting for one.

I had the bacon bacon cheeseburger followed by a raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake. I could barely move after. The food was amazing. Don't make plans that you have to rush off to after! You'll be way too full up lol. Very tasty food here. You have to visit!"}
{"text":"First time going. Delicious! I had the skinny burger on my sisters recommendation. The mojito was very good. I could've drank several more. My waitress was very nice. The place is gorgeous. Rumor had it you were coming to my hometown. Please say that it's so. See you all again tomorrow."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and food, my favprite is the cobb salad. usually has okay service but could definitely be better! Won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday and let me tell you...the food is really good, our waitress was great (she handled our party of 9 great), and the cheesecake is absolutely wonderful!! I thought it was a bit pricey, but nothing too outrageous.  I'm used to sides coming with the dinners and not paying a la carte for them.  The floor is a bit slick so please watch while walking.  I don't know how the waiters and waitresses didn't slip.  Great food and great fun."}
{"text":"I've always loved  the Cheesecake Factory.  I remember eating at the one in Chicago, located inside the John Hancock building downtown. It was always so beautiful especially around Christmas and always so packed and busy and crowded and festive and all those things that make eating out so exciting and worth it. We used to always see Jerry Springer eating dinner by himself when we were there. I love the vast menu selections the skinny licious chicken and  pretzel covered chicken strips are a wonderful meal.  Another one of my favorite items Is the chicken chili. It is extremely pricey especially when you go with a family of four.  We spend an average of $200 bucks on dinner.   The location near me is a little inconsistent in their overall service and meal presentation. But I'll continue to give it a chance ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the World...  their \" Bistro Shrimp Pasta\" is heavenly... Service is always great and fast, despite being so busy!!!! You can tell that CEO\" s really do care for their staff. Love this place! I keep going back for great food and awesome, friendly waiters!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. My fiancé and I met up with our really good friend and we got a table pretty quick for a Friday night. It wasn't as packed than what I was expecting. 

We ordered our all-time favorite appetizer, Factory Nachos. And for my entree I ordered the Truffle-Honey Chicken (a fried chicken breast with truffle-honey drizzled on the chicken), which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus.

2 stars because we had very poor service. Our waitress didn't come by for our order for a good 15-20 mins, our food took forever to come out, my chicken was burnt, and our waitress only came by once to fill up our drinks. 

I love The Cheesecake Factory, but I don't think I will be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"My family and I have been repeat customers of this Cheesecake Factory due to the variety of foods on the menu, excellent servers, and on point floor managers. I've gone so far as to download the Cakepay app and religiously use it to speed up the payment process. With that being said, this experience sealed the deal on not returning to this location.

From the jump, our party of 5 ( 4 adults and my newborn baby ) were seated in a booth designed for only four adults. Normally, not a problem if you have a baby sling standing by. This was not the case. Our hostess stood idly by while we had to request a sling so we could fit our party into the seating arrangement. Common sense, not all too common these days. 

Moving forward from there, our server greeted us promptly and took our drink order. This was the highlight of our experience. I will admit that I'm always thrilled to have a solid server that takes this often unappreciated discipline and nails it. I ordered drinks for the table ( I know what they all wanted ) and then waited the 10 minutes for our drinks to be retrieved. A glass of wine, dirty vodka martini, a lemonade, and four waters brought the bar to a grinding halt. At this point, I was not only familiar with the menu, but I was reciting it verbatim. 

Our table ordered their meals. My wife made a simple request for a straw to be brought at the server's next visit for her water glass. Request... Denied. I ordered the Chicken AND Shrimp Gumbo directly from menu with the modification of brown rice over the white rice. ( We're eating healthier these days ). The rest of our table ordered from the on average $18 / plate menu. 

When our food arrived, everyone appeared to have their food arrive in satisfactory condition. Upon further review, I noticed that my gumbo had zero shrimp in the mix and the \" broth \" had a watery consistency. I stopped eating after a few bites and my wife noticed my behavior immediately. We then called our server over and pointed out the shortcoming from the kitchen. He said, \"oh, I thought you said, 'chicken gumbo, do you want me to take it back? ' \" . I replied that, \"It's alright, I'll just eat what was made.\" A few bites later, I stopped completely.  Any server worth their white shirt and black pants would've immediately removed the dish, grabbed a manager, and offered compensation in some manner. 

Quick background: my wife and I were both servers in our younger days. We have a level of respect that comes with leaving a minimum 20% tip for decent service... That streak ended this evening. He got 18% despite delivering a sub-par 15% level of performance. 

The meal was not up to Cheesecake Factory standards to which we're accustomed. The service while not horrible has slipped to a McDonald's level of customer satisfaction ( Sorry, Ronald ). I refuse to dine at an establishment at an $18/ plate average and accept mediocrity. We'll just go on down the road to Carraba's, Oregano's, or even On The Border... At least I'll get what I'm paying for at those establishments.

Thank you for making my decision easy to not accept sub standard service at mid-level pricing."}
{"text":"Love it here. Always fun and great service! On this particular visit I decided to try the Pina Colada Cheesecake and it was an absolute delight to my taste buds. For my main course I had the Jambalaya... extremely yummy to my tummy!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Mexican tortilla salad with chicken.
There were about four small bite sized pieces of chicken. When I told the waitress, so didn't do anything.
If we had not been with acquaintances, I would have complained. Will definitely not return.
Way too costly for the type of salad."}
{"text":"I think this location is one of their finest! 
My wife and I went to dinner in the Christmas eve when we were in Vegas. The service was truly great. The atmosphere was fabulous. 

I liked their interior design ... It looked little bit different from many Cheesecake Factory's locations. We ordered: 

Caesar Salad: Good ... I have to say not like the ones in LA, but was good really. 

Fried Shrimp platter: Mediocre in my opinion. I was expecting something much better than what it came that night to me! 

Chicken Cajun: Much better than the Shrimp's, but also less than the expectations. 

In all with the service and the design, it deserve 4 stars without hesitation."}
{"text":"Gotta make this one in english 

Last year I went to Vegas with some friends and i really needed to try their cheesecake at The cheesecake factory. I've heard good things and i'm a sucker for cakes so I really needed this. 

We went in and started with some lunch -and wauv..... got the best bacon & scrambled eggs and really big and delicious fat pancakes -yummi :)
Couldn't eat the whole thing because I also wanted the cake. I got one with mango on the top and my friend for one with lemon -they were both really delicious :)

The service was on top. Actually the service in the U.S is just better and sweeter than in DK. 
The waitress was there smiling all the time, came to ask if we needed anything, if the food was ok, just chatting and wanted to hear a bit about our vacation and DK. 

I am really going back -both to Vegas and the cheesecake factory - I've never gotten such great cakes and there was a lot to choose from -gotta try then all :)"}
{"text":"So, the final verdict is out. 312 menu items, not including beverage offerings. Holy crap. If you can't find something you like at Cheesecake Factory, you are just a grumpy Gus.  I had the taco salad-type dish. It was ok - sooo much lettuce - but my friend had the Santa Fe sandwich, which he said was tasty. Wine was good and didn't break the bank. 

This location is apparently the busiest in the world. I wouldn't doubt it... It's always packed."}
{"text":"I love the fish and chips here and the carrot cake and the carrot cake cheesecake. Nice bar area that you can also dine at without waiting for a table. Good service too."}
{"text":"Had high expectations going in, and it definitely did not disappoint. The wait was 90 minutes, but they took down our name and gave us a buzzer so that we could go shopping instead of waiting in line. The buzzer did go off after around 90 minutes. Our server was extremely attentive even though it was incredibly busy. Servings were huge as well (not complaining though)."}
{"text":"So I have been to a few different Cheesecake Factories and they all have one thing in common. Go there for the cheesecake the entrees and appetizers and all the other meals are more than subpar. I feel that it is overpriced especially since the food really is not all that great. But if you're looking for a good dessert then that's where you should go. I would recommend going restaurant hopping and getting your entrée somewhere else and then coming here for dessert."}
{"text":"Went to cheesecake factory and  Alex was our server, he did an excellent job, he mention from the soup of the day, to chef special to the 35 different cheesecakes and some special cheesecake. He refill our drinks and he was checking on us. If you ever  go there ask for him. Also, food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Cheesecake Factory lover, I really wanted to eat here before we left Vegas. My husband and I along with our friends went for dinner.  It's super busy, so the wait was about an hour or more. But they have cool attractions and stores close by. The fish tanks out front is very appealing. My daughter enjoyed walking around looking at the fishes.Cheesecake Factory's location within Caesars Palace is a prime locations because there is just so much to see. Caesars Palace had a greek god show (not sure if they have it all the time) but the show was cool. We got to watch it as we ate.  
The service wasn't that great because they were super busy. The food took awhile to come out. When it did come out, some of it was cold. I guess they wanted to wait for everything to be ready before they brought it out. But it was just too busy for us to ask them to heat up our food, considering we waited an hour to order and about 40 mins for our food to come out. Needless to say we still enjoyed our food. We are big Cheesecake Factory lovers. And the greek gods show definitely helped to keep us entertained. 
I would recommend Cheesecake Factory. Just remember if you choose to eat here, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Jack of all trades, master of none.  I have to commend The Cheesecake Factory for offering up meals that will appeal to anyone, but aren't really outstanding.  I had a vegetarian pasta that, while very tasty, made me feel like it expanded to about twice its' normal size in my belly about a half hour later.  Not a good feeling . . .

The avocado egg rolls were very welcome to two Californians on vacation but needing their avocado fix, but they were a little salty.

So, if you're in a diverse group that's hard to please, it might be worth the stop, or if you want a meal with a cheesecake dessert, then obviously this is a great choice, but for true culinary satisfaction, keep on' truckin . . ."}
{"text":"Always great service generously sized dishes and fast service the best thing here is the chicken so whatever you get with chicken you're good to go I haven't had a complaint here in the many times I've been between the drinks or food but have yet to experience the actual cheesecake"}
{"text":"This place was really nice! The drinks were really strong and the food was delicious. The waitress was sweet and she was really attentive. She made sure our drinks said full amd we never had to ask for much. I will come here every time I'm in Las Vegas. I was seated within 15 minutes and I was delighted."}
{"text":"This is a nice location. We were seated quickly and our food was quick to come out. 

We sat in a booth that was like sitting on a bench. We noticed the other booths were well padded. I don't know if this was intentional but it was uncomfortable after about 30 minutes and we ended up getting our meals to go. That was a definite draw back."}
{"text":"I could probably give 3 stars but I'm just not pleased with the experience we just had. Usually it is good but not today. Apparently they only have 4 high chairs in the whole restaurant at this location. If you don't have any toddlers with you you will probably have a good experience. We tried to speak with the manager but he was too busy to come talk to us. We tried to make a booster seat work but it was our granddaughters first time in one so she was having a hard time trying it out. Then they started seating more customers right next to us so instead of disrupting the people around us we decided to leave. We stopped by the hostess stand to try to talk to the manager one more time but he was still too busy to talk to us. We walked down the way to Kona Grill and are having a pleasant experience with a high chair."}
{"text":"Well let's start off by saying I love cheesecake, I mean who doesn't!? We come here every hear and there & will remain too, it's a nice restaurant. Tonight was super busy which was weird since it's a Thursday, but great for them! When we were seated we waited close to 10 minutes before our waiter came over (which was fine they have a HUGE menu). When she did I had to wait for my lemonade for another 10, and we also ordered one cocktail and that took about another 10. We got the chicken Caesar as well as the bacon bacon cheeseburger & they were both delicious and came out in enough time and delicious! I did have to wait another 5ish (give or take) for mine after he got his though, which if any has to wait I'm a firm believer in women first. We also ordered two cheesecakes to go which I'm about to eat and so excited! For what we got it was a little bit more than we would've liked, but hey you can't win. Probably go back in another year or so like normal!"}
{"text":"First of all, there was not enough handicapped parking. I am on a diet (surgery coming up) and expected that there would be calorie counts on the menu, as required by law. Nope. When I complained I was given a small supplemental brochure that was disorganized and type set so small that I could not read.  Our server explained that the cheesecake sales tumbled when they put calories on the menu. Obviously, they made the decision to violate the law."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is a fantastic restaurant. This eatery has everything that you could want. With their large menu and wide verity of items, it is sure to please all at the table. The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, steaks, breakfast items, fish and seafood, deserts and over 40 cheesecake options. They also have a menu for people who are watching their calorie intake or have gluten allergies. During the weekends they offer a Sunday Brunch option, a tradition in many families. Every online posted experience, the food always met or exceeded their expectations. The food is always hot and fresh with great flavors. Here is a quote from Foodie.com about the Cheesecake factory: \"You want selection? There are two pages of just appetizers. TWO pages! Just check out all the mouthwatering selections online if you have a moment. I haven't even tried a tenth of their menu, and yet it remains one of my favorite places to eat. Go for the cheesecake, stay for the food, never a disappointment!\"
This fabulous restaurant has incredible customer service. The staff will greet you right away. They will cater to your special occasions. As an example if you have a birthday or anniversary, they will surprise you with a free desert at the end of the meal. They will even gather the staff and sing happy birthday energetically to the birthday person. If it is an anniversary they will personalize the desert by writing happy anniversary. They will make alterations to the menu items to meet your needs and do it with a smile. Their great attitudes have made many post reviews online with many reputable sites. Some of them include Foodie.com and Yelp. There are incredible reviews written on Yelp for all over the US, proving the consistency of great service. Depending on the mood you are in they have a dine-in and a take-out option. For the take-out option, they also provide curbside pickup. One of the Yelp the reviews said \"Our waiter and he was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the best waiters I have ever had before. Not only was he very good at what he does (taking orders, getting drinks, making sure that everyone is taken care of at the table) he was also very personable. We talked to him a little bit in his down time, and he made us laugh a few times. Everyone at my table loved him, and said the same thing... that he is on of the best waiters we have ever had\" at a restaurant.\"
The atmosphere is a great combination of everything that a person could want. As mentioned earlier there is a dine-in and a take-out option but they also have many other options. Sitting out on the patio to enjoy the weather or stay inside the dining room to avoid the weather. Join the bar for a more social environment. The best time for the bar is during happy hour for that social mood. You could also, snug yourself away in booth for a more intimate setting. The vibe of the restaurant is very upbeat, friendly, fun, personable and beautiful. The walls have beautiful large European murals and pillars. The space is open but a cozy feel as well. It is a place where to dress up or dress down. Guests can bring kids or eat alone. No matter what mood, no matter who the guest is, Cheesecake Factory is a place that all will enjoy. On Foodie.com there are some great articles for Cheesecake factory. One of the quotes said \"I was just blown away by the architecture. The outrageous curves of the art nouveau architecture really sets the mood\""}
{"text":"Wow! First time at this Cheesecake Factory location tonight, and it was packed. Sat in the bar area, and had excellent service! Our server Sorren was very busy and handled everything perfectly. The food was great, and the skinnylicous menu is on point! I came with my mother and sister, and all of us enjoyed our experience. Love the food, love the service, and love the overall vibe!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant inside the Cesar's palace mall..good service but the only thing I don't like is that you have to put away your own left overs. Beside that is a great place with good food."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant! I love their flavors and portion sizes (especially portion sizes for their salads). Their cheesecakes are to die for, but the calorie count is beyond belief and just might kill you (as is the case for most items on their menu).

I love the brown bread they bring to the table when you arrive and their passion fruit iced tea is the bomb! Of course, the avocado eggrolls are exquisite, but I seldom order them. Instead, I found a recipe that tastes exactly the same so make it at home. Making the recipe, though, shows why their food is so good--they use unique and quality ingredients and their dressings and sauces include many, many ingredients (many of which are hard to find).

I usually order a dinner salad, eat half of it, and take the rest home (asking for a little extra dressing in my take-home bag). With the remainder, I can make two more meals simply by adding extra lettuce. 

The Cheesecake Factory is not cheap so is truly a special treat. They offer take-out so are a great option when traveling and don't feel like going out to eat or ordering room service."}
{"text":"I have the same dish everytime we come because it is so good, chicken picatta, and I enjoy a martini with dinner, Bombay Sapphire and Titos. Yes gin AND vodka, I order this everywhere I go and never have had the problems I have here....I have tried on more than 5 different visits and all 5 times I was charges differently.  The first time I came was 9$ fine...the 2nd time was 25$!!!....the 3rd time was 18$, then 16$ and finally 12$...  Each visit I asked for a manager to get my bill straight the 25$ excuse was the put it in as 2 called drinks..  WHAT????  The 18$ was \"input wrong\", and the last time when I was charged 12$ I was told 12$ is the right price because they charge 1$ per Bleu Cheese olive!!!  OMG!!!  I have been ordering this drink for pretty much my entire adult life with 3 bleu cheese olives and have NEVER been charged extra and they aren't even hand stuffed!!!  I have had the bartenders offer to make them for me in places that don't normally have them and they receive a great reward in the terms of their tip...I don't get charged extra!!!  The time when the manager told me the drink was 12 due to the olives I said I was very upset and would not be back, all he said was \"sorry to hear that\"  and walked away.... really made us feel wanted!!  The food and service is almost always on point and that's why we love it here but they need to be all on the same page when it comes to the charges!!!  Maybe appreciate the customers a little more as well...we are spending a small fortune for the short time we spend in your establishment!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great & the food was typical Cheesecake Factory. I appreciate the consistency, no matter which location we have been to. Their new Celebration Cheesecake was a hit with my little one and the pork sliders were my dad's favorite."}
{"text":"I've been here way too many times to keep count. The staff is amazing every time! The food isn't too bad but I prefer to come here just for cheesecake, and the endless bread. The bread is always warm and perfect. My brother claims that their burgers are juicy and delicious, but I've never tried them. My favorite cheesecakes here are the Godiva, Tuxedo, and White Chocolate Raspberry. The Godiva cheesecake is too tasty to resist; so creamy, so soft, so sweet, so delicious mmmhmmmm. 

It's absolutely delightful when I come here for a birthday, be it mine or a friend's. If you order cheesecake, then they write Happy Birthday on your plate and include a candle. If you don't, they present you with a complimentary sundae with a candle on top. A good number of the staff come up to your table and gleefully embarrass you by singing Happy Birthday."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory I love you. I love you. I love you.

I have tried every single thing on the menu. You heard me. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. (Okay, not including the new hibachi menu. That is a brand new page added recently)

It was all good. Mostly great. But if about 90% of your 1,000,000,000 menu items are awesome - you deserve 5 stars from me.

PS - Please clean your bathroom more frequently. This might knoock you down a star."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend last night started off with a super nice waitress that took our order fast then after a 10 or so minute wait some other waitress comes by and says she's ours that \"they had things to figure out\". The food wasn't terrible but could have been better. We decide to order dessert and mine had a hair inside!! It literally flossed my teeth as I was pulling it out of my mouth! I was so disgusted my friend explained to our new waitress that it was gross I didn't want mine and she'll take a new one as she was scared that hers might have hair in it too since it was the same flavor. She brought me a new one when I said I didn't want another one...I was pretty grossed out a brand new slice is not what I asked for. Then the bill came and my cheesecake was still on there! $8 for a slice of cheesecake with hair in it? No thank you. So I ask for a manager and after waiting 10 minutes he finally comes by and is upset with me!! Wow, what amazing customer service that was. We tipped her $5 but I feel like there is no point in tipping someone who can't do their job. I can still feel that hair in my mouth today...I doubt I'll be returning to this location at least."}
{"text":"this food is decent. But it takes a long time to get. It took 40 minutes to get the appetizer. And I had to ask twice for my milk. It Has now been here a total of 1 hour and 20 minutes since I came  - still waiting for food"}
{"text":"After a night of talking, listening to music and chillaxing with friends.  Around 11ish, about 11:15 to be exact, we got really hungry.  We all had the taste for pizza and wings.  We tried to order from the Streets of New York but they closed at 10 unfortunately.  So we decided to order take out from the Cheesecake Factory.  Can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.  It's been one of my favorite chain restaurants for yearsssssssssss.  I've never, ever ordered take out ever!

It was 3 of us.  I ordered the tomato basil pasta.  My friend ordered a creamy pasta dish with bacon and peas.  My other friend ordered a black bean dish with shrimp and chicken.  I'll start with describing my dish.  BLAND!  My goodness it was bland!  I could taste every ingredient separately, the noodles, the basil, the tomato sauce and the garlic, but there was no season.  It lacked regular salt and pepper.  My friend's shrimp and black bean curry dish did NOT have any black beans in it what so ever.  The curry sauce also didn't taste like much.  This is one of the 2 dishes my friend frequently orders so he was for sure it didn't taste the same.  My other friend's dish was just as bland.  We're all almost for certain that the reason behind the bland food was the fact that there were near closing time.  This no excuse for sure and was highly disappointing.  Of course I'll try this Cheesecake Factory location again, maybe even take out, just not within an hour of them closing."}
{"text":"Awful service from when we walked in the door to when we left. 
Right when we walked in the receptionist made eye contact with us then just ignore us so we had to walk toward her and say \"Hi\" first which is unacceptable. Second, she told us to wait a couple minutes to be seated while there was no waiting list. So she watched us walked out and walked back in and then she responded \" oh i thought you guys left\". She was just terrible at what she does. Also, i ordered a chicken burrito with guacamole and without cilantros and of course they made it with cilantros on it. It couldn't of got any worse but then they bring my burrito with no guacamole. I addressed it and she said they ran out of guacamole. At that time i was almost halfway through my burrito. It would have been nice to know there was no guacamole before they brought out my burrito for the second time."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight and everything was perfect! There was a 20 min wait even for a Wednesday, our server, Desirae (sp?), was amazing and completely on top of everything, food was fantastic with huge proportions and I can't forget the cheesecake that we took togo. Everything was great!!"}
{"text":"What is there not to like about this place? They have a menu for everyone! I love how they have all different types of food! The orange chicken is one of my favorite meals!! Must try!"}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could. We were seated fast  ... 15-20 minutes went by ... no server... nobody even acknowledged us. We walked out and the server just shrugged. It wasn't busy and I thought it was rude. I  have had good experiences at other locations so this was disappointing."}
{"text":"We decided to take a rare visit to a chain restaurant. The place is huge! Ambiance and decor is very inviting. But that's where it ends. Although the menu is quite large, the prices are quite high, and the food pretty mediocre. Drink prices are too high! Almost $12 for a Jameson Irish martini??   I thought the $19 I paid for my Bang Bang shrimp/chicken was not worth it.  Was somewhat on the bland side. Guess I'll stick to the mom n pop locally owned restaurants."}
{"text":"What can I say, we love Cheesecake Factory!  We just don't go often because we do have some local favorites or places we can get in and out of quicker.  You just have to go in expecting to wait when you get there for a table and again waiting for the food.

They have an extensive menu which I have tried a lot of, but Kevin and I have found the two dishes that we love and get every single time!  When we have a gift card, we usually get each dish, but if we don't, we usually get the combo, as these two dishes also come as a combo.  Great amount for us to share!  We of course love it when we have a gift card so that we can have it for multiple nights!  What are the dishes?  Chicken madeira and steak Dianne!  Both the chicken and steak are awesome.  We love the potatoes too!  If you get the chicken madeira, ask for extra sauce on the side because it is fantastic to pour on the mashed potatoes!

We are full by the time we are done, so we always take our cheesecake to go.  Can't go there without getting cheesecake as it is awesome and cheesecake is my favorite!  My favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the apple streusel, which we happened to get both of those this time.  Normally we try out different ones each time, they have some other good ones as well.  I am disappointed that they got rid of my favorite a couple years ago - the oreo cheesecake, but now they have the oreo dream extreme, I've had it once, but just give me an entire oreo cheesecake rather than all the chocolate richness in the cake and other layers!

We will be back!  (PS we are now out of giftcards, anyone who wants to give us one we will be happy to take ;-D )"}
{"text":"Let's start so we went the first time to The Cheesecake Factory we heard a lot about it so the service was very nice the waitress was very friendly. We ordered two appetizers and to main dishes till then we didn't know that this will be a such big portion so after the food arrived ( fried calamari and eggroll sampler we started to eat the sampler and oh man taste was good but seriously the outside batter was soaked in oil... we didn't know if the food was cooked in oil or oil was cooked in the food  oh man we tried some calamari too and same issue toooooo much oil we couldn't finish it so then the main dishes arrived and oh man again same issue u could see the oil, flavor wise it was fine. I would say reduce the oil and u guys are perfect...we took just to bites of the main dishes and we were done ... we could feel after hours the food in our tummy end of story upset stomach!! 
Just a advice reduce the oil but maybe they know it's oily that's why they have the skinny menu so maybe I should go with that for the next time"}
{"text":"Last weekend we were in Las Vegas and came here for my birthday dinner. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. This location is also so beautiful. I can't wait to go back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Avoid weekends, always a really long wait. I come on weekdays for dinner and lunch and then eat at bar for faster service. Great food, huge menu and more expensive than most chains, but worth it."}
{"text":"First .... have a house salad ... all kinds of spring greens.  It is one of the best salads I have ever eaten.

Second ... order the filet ... tell them not to butterfly it ... have the waitress repeat back to you ... do not butterfly 

Sit back and enjoy ... you will be give a cleaver to cut your steak ... a butter knife will do.

I won't even begin to describe the desserts.  

Wear loose pants ... you not going to want to waste a single bite."}
{"text":"Was here on the second day of opening. It was a ridiculous 2 hour wait and crazy line up at both entrances of the restaurant (one was for take-outs, the other was for seating). You have to line up to get your name on the list. Then after, they will give you a buzzer where the furthest you can wonder during your wait was as far as Victoria secret.

Our server was very polite and friendly. Even though restaurant was crazy busy, we didn't have to wait long for our food. We ordered three different appetizers which include spinach dip, calamari, and Caesar salad. The spinach dip was good but I thought they didn't give enough chips. It was nice that they also served the dip with salsa and sour cream on the side. Calamari in my opinion was just meeeehhhhhh. Caesar salad was good but the dressing had a hint of spiciness to it.

We ordered four different mains to share. There was a chicken filet dish with pasta on the side (I forgot the name but it was delicious), Diane steak with mash potato, chicken and Diane steak combo with sweet potato fries, and a pasta that tasted like a pizza. All the mains were decent. 

Last but not least, we obviously ordered cheesecakes. We had four different ones...red velvet, tiramisu cheesecake, salted caramel, and strawberry shortcake. Red velvet and tiramisu were the winners! I loved how the tiramisu one was light even those cheesecake was suppose to be somewhat heavy. Salted caramel in my opinion was just wayyyyyy to sweet. I felt like I ate like 10k calories just from that one (sugar overload). The strawberry shortcake was such a disappointment as well. Was totally not what we expected. We literally expected a cake but it came out as biscuit patties with ice cream. The biscuits did not even taste fresh. 

Overall, we had good services from the staffs. There was one who came and took our dessert before we received our mains as she said there was a long wait for dessert and didn't want us sitting around waiting for it after our meal..therefore, she wanted to get it ready first. Her intention was thoughtful but the desserts came out during our mains and we just got super confused by it. Management wanted to make sure everything was alright so they did come around to apologize.

I will come back but I will wait until the hype is over because I don't think it's worth the wait especially a 2 hour wait."}
{"text":"We went there expecting to have a good Father's Day meal..We got our drinks and we told the server we were ready and he walked away and it was literally a good 12 minutes before he came back to take our order. I guess the table next to us was angry with him so he came back with an attitude towards then we find out most of the dishes we wanted were 86'd. We waited another 35 mins for our food..no exaggeration. We were very disappointed, the server was very rude and avoided us a lot. I understand having a bad shift or having guests treat you bad but don't take it out on the guests that are actually nice to you. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I was recently in a rush getting ready for a party, so I ordered a cheesecake here for curbside pickup, thinking I could save some time. I called when I arrived and was greeted right away, but then I waited 15 minutes for them to bring the cheesecake out. When I got home, the cheesecake was still frozen. It tasted fine once it thawed, but I can buy a much better cheesecake from Costco that is twice as big for half the price. $30 for a frozen 7\" cheesecake was definitely not worth it, especially since the convenience factor was eliminated."}
{"text":"The food is decent a little bit overpriced my real problem with this place is the service we experienced. We were sitting outside for about 20 minutes waiters kept going by we got up and we were ready to leave when a server approached us and asked if we had a server so we said no  and he went and found who our server was.  Elizabeth than came to our table and said I kept wondering why no server was  checking up on you guys  turns out I'm your server. She kept making excuse after excuse not once did she apologize. By the end of our dinner we were already so annoyed by her she tried to get us to have desert and kept  trying to force us to have desert and than made a stupid comment  \"are you guys gonna make me run around here like a chicken with their head cut off to get you guys to order desert\" which we still have yet to figure out what she meant  by it. The bill then came you would've thought that when two people are spending almost a hundred bucks for dinner and drinks it would've been nice to have something taken off the check. Nope you're wrong not with Elizabeth. Oh and once more she made an excuse for making us wait 20+ minutes when the restaurant wasn't even busy. This happened about 3 months ago and I'm still furious about leaving her a tip. We've been back since and always make sure we don't have Elizabeth."}
{"text":"I have gone to this specific location many times, but I have never had such great service as I did on my most recent visit. Our waiter was Tim and he was fantastic (the main reason why I wrote this review). He was funny, attentive and, personable. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and, like always, was happy with the dish. If I was able to give Tim a raise, I would- he definitely deserves it."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the cheesecake factory? Can't complain, service was great! Food always taste the same no matter which one you go to."}
{"text":"The issue I have with the Cheesecake Factory probably makes me seem a bit ridiculous to some, but I think if you hear me out, you will see my p.o.v. 

I believe that the draw to the Cheesecake Factory is their atmosphere. They spend a ton of money on creating a rich and interesting decor. Okay, the other draw is the Cheesecake. But the real draw is how cool the building looks, inside and out. Given that what they are selling is ambiance, how can they sell advertising in their menu? Their mid-quality meals are totally overpriced, something I am willing to overlook since I feel like what you are actually paying for is the environment. When they sell ad space in their menu, they are removing their right to charge the completely bogus prices that they ask. I can handle ads in menus at local places like the Winking Lizard because they aren't charging you for ambiance. 

I am completely insulted by the Cheesecake Factory's audacity."}
{"text":"About to get the Chocolate Godiva it's hotter then lady GA Ga and looks bueatiful like the candy"}
{"text":"I visited here with my family, and thankfully the wait was not too long.  (I've visited the one in Columbus and the wait on a weekend is still 3 hours, years after it opened.)  We didn't think much of the atmosphere - it was quiet and very dark, almost to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating.

I ordered a pasta but requested no nuts on top, due to my allergies, which I made clear to the waitress.  Because the restaurant was so dark, I didn't realize right away that there were nuts on it, but when the waitress came around again, I had to send my food back.  This always leads to awkwardness - do your dining companions keep eating, or do they let their food get cold while you're waiting for a new dish?  The manager apologized but we were still charged for the meal.  We thought the least he could do would be to comp it, as the whole incident considerably disrupted our dinner and it was the fault of either the waitress or kitchen staff.  But we decided to not make a fuss.  We ordered cheesecake to go, as we were full.

Once I got home, I dug into my Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake.  At the time (this was several years ago), the menu did not mention that the cookie dough contained walnuts.  There was no little asterisk, no caution from the waitress, nothing.  I probably should have asked, but normally chocolate chip cookie dough does not contain walnuts, and with food allergies on the rise I feel that a restaurant should warn its patrons.  I made a complaint on the website and received a $25 gift card.

I haven't been back since, not because I'm boycotting but more because I don't find anything particularly fabulous about the menu and the wait times can be ridiculous.  But I did want to warn anyone with food allergies to be very careful about what they order, and to double-check with your waiter/waitress to avoid any bad reactions."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy the Cheesecake Factory; I hope this experience turns out to be a \"one off.\"  

The waiter \"Mike\" was very good, attentive, \"on top of things.\"  The appetizers were Corn Fritters (very good), Fried Zucchini (very good but not much on the plate), and Artichoke and Spinach dip, (tasty but very, very oily). 

The others ordered Burgers, Salads, Orange Chicken....all generally pleased.

My dinner was the Shepard's Pie, very large plate with a large circular dollop of mashed potatoes on top. It looked great....one bite later and all I could taste was \"cumin.\"  So overpowering I couldn't eat it.

It seems that seasonings come into vogue and pass from the scene every year. 
In this case, the current spice of the month, quarter, perhaps year is \"cumin,\" a spice which does wonders in minute quantities, and is ruinous in large doses. 

Unfortunately, the cook at the Scottsdale Cheesecake Factory uses a ruinous amount in the Shepard's Pie. 

I decided that while I waited for Mike to return to the table I'd eat the mashed potatoes from the the top of the Shepard's Pie....wrong; too salty to eat. If the person who made the mashed potatoes couldn't taste the salt long before it reached that level, there is something seriously wrong with their taste buds; combined with the overwhelming amount of cumin in the Shepard's Pie ( a dish not known for its \"cumin like\" qualities) it leaves you wondering how this person got into a cooking position.

Back to Mike....he was ready to make it right...took an order for something else, stayed with it to ensure I got my replacement meal quickly an in general took excellent care of a table of 5 like a pro."}
{"text":"My family and I where here to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It was a Saturday evening our server was very pleasant despite how busy she was. The Cheesecake Factory has a large menu and I found a sandwich that I would only have to make one substitution due to my allergies. Unfortunately, the kitchen did not prepare my sandwich correctly. I brought it to my servers attention and she was very appologict and the manager came out as well she was appologict and friendly and compensated us for the mix up and wished my daughter a happy birthday. It is very rare to receive this kind of customer service in 2018. Thank you Cheesecake Factory Scottsdale AZ."}
{"text":"Our experience started off on the wrong foot because we had called ahead to make a reservation and were told that they don't take reservations on Tuesday nights and that lead us to believe ..... Hmmm must not be a busy night for them??!   Unfortunately,  we got there and were told that we should've called ahead and made a reservation!  We spoke with management and explain thatwe did attempt to do just that and perhaps maybe their staff that answers phone needs better training on how to address their \"limited reservations\"....  overall I believe they were understaffed as a whole.  Our waiter did an excellent job balancing what he was in charge of taking care of and our food did arrive in a timely fashion and was all prepared deliciously!  We had a large group and had we known ahead of time about the \"limited reservations\" we could have planned accordingly!   Communication fixes problems before they start!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, but our waiter Skyler is the best ever. What an outstanding personality for someone if his age. If I was still working I would hire him immediately. This young man is going far. I hope Cheese Factory recognizes his talents and promotes him ASAP"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many cheesecake factories, from Biltmore/Phoenix to Kierland to Irving, CA to San Diego and beyond, and. I can honestly say that my experience this last Saturday has completely soured the experience. I know that one lousy waitress shouldn't ruin my entire opinion of a franchise, but \"Tiana\" our waitress as pretty much guaranteed that it will be a LONG time before I return. It took forever to get anything we ordered. After saying we were not interested in dessert, she proceeded to spend 15 minutes telling us about the new items on the menu. She brought out our check without asking if we would like to split the check. We gave her 2 cards told her to put $X on one card and the balance on the other. When she brought it back, she had done the opposite. A few days later when we looked online at our bank accounts, she did not charge me at all and charged my friends card twice.
It was just a miserable experience and I hope it doesn't speak for the chain as a whole and the types of people they are choosing to hire to represent their brand."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! I have been to this location multiple times and have never had a bad experience. The waiters are friendly and are very helpful. I like how there are many shops around it just incase you need to kill time and it is very convenient for the movie theater to be right across the street. 

They have a big selection of food, desserts and drinks. And the portions are big so you get your money's worth. The only downside is that this location gets really crowded because a lot of people from the Southside, downtown and neighboring areas flock to this location. Usually, if you go to get a table anytime before 6:30 it won't be a bad/long wait."}
{"text":"You could say I'm a regular... I've been coming about once or twice a month for the past 5 years, give or take. My recommendation- go ahead, take the time and read the menu. This place is known for their novel-length selection with literally hundreds of items and unique bites. Consistently mediocre service, great ambiance, and they always have exactly what you're in the mood for from sushi to barbecue. Oh, and cheesecake. Yeah that's pretty much the whole reason I love this place. 

Between friends and family, I've seen and tried a huge amount but my go-to is a dinner-sized appetizer with a few substitutions. It's called the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I substitute the noodles with avocado and the chicken with salmon. It's super healthy, the dips are to die for, and lasts me at least two meals. Some of my other favorites, and slightly less healthy options, include the Mac And Cheese burger and Chicken Bellagio (ask for extra sauce). You really can't go wrong with those. My mom swears by the kale quinoa salad and proclaims it's the best kale she's ever had. 

Okay as for the cheesecakes, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake is my newest favorite- replacing my previous favorite of Ultimate Red Velvet. It was seasonal this fall (2015) and became a part of the menu due to popular demand. I'm SO glad. I absolutely love cheesecake and have one each time I go. Other favorites include the White Chocolate and Reece's Peanut Butter Cup."}
{"text":"Usually my family and I love this place but that was not the case today. Our server Scott was terrible!  Took forever to bring our drinks and no straws. Never refilled our drinks and never bothered to check on us!  Food was great as always!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I went back to this Cheesecake Factory.  The food is never as good as the Columbus or Lyndhurst.  The service is usually not as friendly either.  Today's visit diffently proved that.  We were seated right away which was nice.  Then proceeded to sit there for over 20 minutes without any beverages.  One waiter asked us and said he would help us. So we saw he had other tables, so we waited (cause I was going to wait 1 more minute so that it would be an even 20 minutes at that point) while he helped his tables.  When he left, we thought, well now maybe we will get something to drink.  Then we saw him cleaning the tables.  I saw other people while waiting who did the bussing, not the servers.  So we all got up and left.  Then one in our party wanted to talk to a manager on our way out.  He happened to be at the hostess station we were passing.  He basically rolled his eyes at us with a smirk on his face.  Didn't even offer any platitudes or apologies (barely even looked at any of the four of us).  The restaurant was not that busy, not even half full.  Plus, they had plenty of people working there and walking around.

Edit:
So I pasted this review to the company's website.  The restaurant's General Manager just called me to apologize.  He was at least kind enough to do this.  Still highly doubtful I'll go back to this place."}
{"text":"Been coming to Cheesecake Factory for at least 20 years.  Have always enjoyed the food and ambiance.  My problem is that they have changed the variety and quality of their wines.   Only a couple of types of wine and the choices were not good.  Wines that generate a lot of profit because of the low cost. The Beringer that my wife just had literally burned going down her throat.  I sampled it and she was correct.  Not what I would expect at this type of restaurant.  Also, while I'm ranting, how about an IPA on tap?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed and frustrated with the service and quality of the food. 
Our waitress was very inefficient bringing bread and refills took forever. 
Our food came out an hour after we ordered it. 
One entree at a time and two of the orders were wrong and it took forever to replace them. 
My chopped salad wasn't fresh but okay. 
The Alfredo fettuccine only had butter without any sauce. 
Maybe instead of having such an extensive menu they should concentrate on making good quality food. 
Our table never got cleared of dirty dishes. This is the second time having such a terrible dining experience here. I thought the first time we had a bad experience was a fluke but apparently not. 
The manager did comp our deserts and the Cheesecake was wonderful but not enough to go back for lunch or dinner again. 
With all the exceptional Restaurants in the valley next time I will choose one that has good quality food and service."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a number of times, and have left satisfied every time. They have two floors and a seating area out in the front to enjoy the hourly show and huge fish tank (and people watching... who am I kidding). All of my waiters & waitresses have done a great job and making sure my needs were met :) The ambiance is like every other Cheesecake Factory; dim and romantic.

My most recent time here I ordered the Renee Special. It is half of a sandwich, a bowl of soup, and a small side salad. All of it was great! The only thing is the salad was a little bland and only had leaves and balsamic vinaigrette. The soup was incredible! Cream of chicken with bacon bits on top. The half of sandwich was really good as well.

I would recommend Cheesecake Factory for anyone, the menu is extensive enough to meet anyone's craving needs!"}
{"text":"Great place for dates!!!! If your looking not too expensive, not to formal but delicious!!! This is the place. I love the cheesecake factory it was one of the very first \"nice\" restaurants i had been too. Well what I thought was nice at the time. The decor inside is great, nice clean tables with linens, yes that right linens! the MENU is EXTENSIVE. They have everything from Asian to American and all in between. The food is really good but not up-scale quality. Always nice plating presentation. I got the chicken pesto pasta dish (wish I could remember its name) none the less delicious. The cheesecake menu is elaborate and they always update the menu with specials added. The bill leaving with cheesecake dinner and app with complimentary bread was around 40.00, YES i said 40.00 for 2. Such a great date night dinner paired with a movie its sure to impress any ordinary lady. A little more about the interior is huge high ceilings with pillars and faux painting to make the insides look like old Tuscan themed buildings. the lighting is a blend between modern and fresco period and lights a set to dim. Each table has its own real lit candles. This is a great place for groups and family dinners birthdays etc. I usually don't fall into the trap of what I like to call COOKIE CUTTER restaurants but if I had to choose between the factory and any other place Ive ever went its in top 3! Plus there is so much on the menu to choose from your bound to satisfy any palette."}
{"text":"We go here a couple times a year and always for my sons birthday,  as this is his favorite place. We were in there Sunday, March 12, 2017. Service was awesome but I was the lucky one who got food poisoning. I have never been so sick in my entire life. I ordered the Avacado Egg Rolls. I order these every time I come here. Tasted fine but the aftermath was horrible. At this time I can honestly say I can't imagine a return."}
{"text":"We showed up at around 9pm on a Saturday and it wasn't even busy. We did have about 7 adults and 3 kids but our wait time was only about 10 minutes. The only good thing I can say is that our kids got their food faster than anything else.

I just wanted a simple burger with bacon, the rest of their options weren't what I wanted. I got the bleu cheese burger WITHOUT bleu cheese...of course it was like an hour later they finally bring us our dishes and it had the bleu cheese. I was really disappointed because the waiter was kind of mean. He tells me ITS NOT and totally insisted i try it. If I don't like it, why would I eat it?! My husband tasted it and said of course it's bleu cheese. If it wasn't then there wouldn't be any cheese on the burger at all :( They sent it back and I had to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to make a new one...Considering our tab was over $280, I wouldn't go back there for the bad service I received and my burger wasn't even good to say the least..."}
{"text":"We tried this Cheesecake Factory after having a dismal experience at another Cheesecake factory further north than this one.  A couple's dinner and we ordered the following:
Avocado Salad,  Fresh and delicious.  Not overdressed. 
Chicken Piccata with pasta and plenty of Parmagiano Reggiano, grated right in front of you.  
Delicious and perfectly made.
Eggplant Parmagiana with Pesto Pasta,  Really delicious.  Sauce was great.  Pesto pasta was not overly aggressive with garlic.  It was just right.  
Kobe Burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms and sweet potato fries. Had this because there were no turkey burgers.  The Kobe Burger was OK but nothing to write home about.  Sweet potato fries were good.  
The bread was delicious but we had to ask about 3 times before we got our first service of bread although the place was not packed.  Tasty bread.  Other than that, the service was good as they kept our waters refreshed.  
I will admit that I was shocked by how good their pasta dish was.  I normally don't even try italian dishes at non-italian restaurants but the waiter, Jesus, convinced me it was a wonderful dish.  
It was refreshing to go to a Cheesecake Factory and have a meal that I don't have to complain about.  I just want good food and good service and I got it at this Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"In general I love the cheesecake factory.  We'd not had a great experience at this one last time, so I wasn't sure about trying it again, but we were please. The service was pretty good and the food was quite good.  I had the endive, pecan and blue cheese salad and my husband had the ahi tuna app...both very nice.  We will return."}

{"text":"I've been to cheesecake factory many time but tonight's experience was awful. It started out fine long wait for dinner with large party. Amazing server Drew was very upbeat and sweet, kept up with all of our drinks and was able to get all meals right. Once meals were tasted is where things went south. The pasta was awful and tasted like buttery noodles. No seasoning was on them or garlic flavor whatsoever. Some of us had this issue (4) of us out of the large party. We weren't going to complain because we have all worked service and it was not the waiters fault. But once something was said an incompetent old woman came to the table to let us know it was suppose to taste like butter. Which we all have had this dish before we are not children yet she only conversated for a moment never acknowledging that there was something wrong with the dish only trying to convince us that it's suppose to taste awful like that. Save your money people don't eat here. Not worth it at all!"}
{"text":"I have had to upgrade my original review.  We have gone back many times and we always love their food.  My husband orders something different every single visit, and he has yet to be disappointed.  I always order the pear flatbread, and I'm still loving it!  There is nothing lacking."}
{"text":"This is not my first CCF.  Lately I am afraid their quailty is going down.  I had a chicken sandwich and the chicken was tough and dry.  The fries were cold and tasteless.  For the cost of meals it really is not that great.  Service was good."}

My foood was delish as always when i finally got it right and lots of points to manager i see why he has his job he redeemed cheesecake factory for me"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and every time is better than the last. 
The food is fresh and is very consistent. It is good food, nothing exceptionally gourmet but not bad either. 
The service is what sets this place apart from the rest. The waiter we had was friendly and personable. He gave great recommendations and explained all the dishes in great detail. The food came out quickly and he was very attentive to the needs of the table. 
I would return again if nothing else for the great service and of course the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for decades. Through travels we've been to a few dozen (or more) locations. The food at this location was just average. To be honest, however, we arrived 15 minutes before they closed on a Thursday night and the servers we more concerned with cleaning the restaurant rather than working another table. On the other hand, if you stay open you should treat every group the same regardless of the time they arrive. We've ordered the same dishes at other locations and been more satisfied- and had much better service - something this chain normally hangs their hat on.   

A few examples:

*The bread: normally there's two kinds. Meanwhile, because it was late (we assume) they only brought the baguette, not the wheat. And, the baguette was hard, not fresh like we come here for. This bread is something we (and many others) come here for. 

*Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta: Had little to no flavor and the chicken wasn't flavorful and tender, which is normally is (I've ordered this dish a half-dozen times). 

*Flatbread: This flatbread was average, at best. 

*Spicy Cashew Chicken: hit the spot, this one tasted like it always does! 

Let's be real. The Cheesecake Factory normally dishes out better than average food, great service and a fun experience that suits large parties, those on a date or families. We got the short end of the stick on this outing, but they've taken care of us so many times we'll be back."}
{"text":"Fun environment, great staff, very nice Happy Hour and tasty food.  Only sore spot was the value of a glass of Sangria that costs $10.95 in either the \"skinny\" or regular version.  My wife had a glass of each style and we aren't sure that $22 for 2 glasses of wine and fruit is a good value.  It's your call on prices but in our minds that isn't a good deal.  I suspect we will return however you can be certain Sangria won't be included in our next visit."}
{"text":"Best place to eat on the strip.  Great ambiance with the Atlantis show in the middle of the forum shops.  Great service, Great portions!

I will be stopping here each year when we visit Vegas."}

I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory! So far the little nibbles that I got to taste are awesome! I'll be lucky enough to come back next weekend and try out their soft opening and test out the full skills of the staff!! Looking forward to May 14th for this place to open! Good luck! Be prepared for my second review with the soft opening!!"}
{"text":"In Vegas I kinda hoped it'd be all surreal and down the rabbit hole ish like the Chicago spot.

But even though it's not, it's still sooooo good! Sarah and I split the Miso Salmon and had to punch ourselves in the face it was so good!"}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying I LOVE the cheesecake factory. I would give the one in Anaheim, CA (in the Gardenwalk) 5 stars. With that said, I give this specific establishment 2 stars. The service is a hit or miss. Sometimes you will get a server that is right on point but most the time the servers are \"ok.\" The food gets screwed up at this place on a regular basis. One of the mess ups out of many was burned French fries. At an establishment like this I expect high standards. First off the cook was a jerk for even putting it out there to be served. Second the waitress failed by bringing it to us after clearly seeing that it was burned. We had to tell her they were burned (it was obvious) and she didn't even apologize or seem sympathetic she just said ok i'll get you another one, in a quick fast tone. If you alter a dish, they will bring it to you wrong. And i'm not talking about an extreme alteration. I'm talking about asking for a different type of pasta vs. the one it comes with. If they mess up your dish it will come back more screwed up as if to punish you for having the audacity to correct the mistake. Take out is always a guarantee mess up and they always give you less food when you do take out vs. when you sit inside. I am speaking from 3 years of experience with this place. If you can, go to the one in Summerlin they are much better and more on target. its really sad that such an awesome establishment is screwed up and nothing is done to rectify it. I'm not going to list all the messed up incidents from this place because it will turn into a novel. Its a great food chain with wonderful food. There is something for everyone here and you will not be disappointed with the taste of your food, when made properly. I know a lot of flack is given to this place for the high fat and calorie content. I really don't think that people are looking at it from the proper perspective. You need to know they give you huge portions here. The fat and calorie content is based on the huge plate of food you receive. This place is giving you all this food with the intent of being able to have the consumer bring some home for later. You cant possible think that you are supposed to eat all that food in one sitting. The food you get on your plate is way more then what you would get on the appetizer plate. Appetizers are meant to serve 2-4 people and your entrée contains more food then that. So I will leave you with that food for thought ;). If you eat the proper portion its really not that bad in fat and calories. Have you ever seen the fat and calories in a marie calendars frozen meal at the grocery store?! Just think, the portion in a Marie Calendar's frozen meal is 1/3 to 1/4 less then what you would receive on your plate at The Cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"One of the reasons why I love eating at Cheesecake Factory is because the menu has such a wide variety to choose from. It's perfect for when your with a group of people who all want different types of food or if you just don't know what you're hungry for. Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious. 

This particular location is interesting because it's in Boca Park where a lot of the Summerlin snobs hang out. 

Today was a beautiful sunny day so we opted to sit in the patio. Being that there was only 2 of us, and they weren't busy, we were seated right away. However I could tell, almost immediately, that this visit was going to be not a good as previous experiences. Our server, Shawn M, came over to us right away and said \"is everything okay over here?\" This was a very odd way to greet a couple who had literally just been seated. We replied yes. He asked if we were ready to order. We'd been there less than 5 min so we said no. We placed our drink orders and asked for a few more min to review the menu. This was a mistake! Almost 15 min went by before our waiter came back to take our order. We had even closed our menus hoping he'd see we were ready to order. He was attending to other tables right near us. He finally took our order. Another several min went by before someone brought bread to our table. As we ate the yummy bread and waited for our food, we caught wind of an unsatisfied couple right next to us. They seemed to be making quite a fit about some cucumbers and arugula being left off. The manager was at their table trying to smooth it over. Perhaps this is why the waiter in my area seemed off... Our food arrived finally. I ordered the mushroom burger with a salad. My bf ordered the chicken avocado club. Our food was very good. I got a side of ranch to dip my burger in and it was tasty. As we ate, the snobby couple next to us continued to be a pain. The manager ended up re-making their food to-go for them to make up for the mistake. The couple continued to sit at their table even after checking out. Awkward!! I was about half way through my food when they finally got up to leave. As they left I hear the girl say \"this is hysterical that they re-made our food!\" The Summerlin snobs left and mood quickly went from tense to peaceful. 

In conclusion, my experience today was just alright. My server was inattentive and overall a bit off. The Summerlin snobs complaining only made it worse. I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory before and have had great service. This time not so much. If you choose to eat at this location, just beware of the Summerlin snobs. I warned you. If you have an issue with your order, please tell the waiter/waitress quietly otherwise it is unnecessarily disruptive to those around you. Don't be a Summerlin snob!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. So many options so it's almost impossible to not please everybody. The pizza is wonderful here. Wood fired and you can just taste the greatness. I especially love coming here for Sunday brunch. I have never tasted anything as amazing as the Monte Cristo and the Lemon Ricotta pancakes. The pricing is very reasonable for the portion sizes and the quality. The waiters are all very delightful and very fast. The atmosphere is great itself as well. The restaurant is very clean and I don't think l have ever had an unpleasant experience. *Update*: went for drinks this morning ALL the silverware was dirty and the drinks are overpriced. Make sure the utensils are clean that your using if you choose to come. And next door brunch alcoholic beverages are a third of the cost."}
{"text":"My to go order was disgusting. How does a chef even send something out of the kitchen like this? Burnt and inedible. The meat you see that is black is chicken. Inexcusable! The quality of their food keeps getting worse and worse."}

Slow unprepared for a major event they promoted

Never come here again when they advertise a special

Not organized 
Don't come down not worth the wait
And when I finally did get my order way past I was quoted it was wrong"}
{"text":"The food and cheesecake are always great here, but the wait for everything is very long. Took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive. And 15 minutes for our waiter to bring the check to us. I also found something in my drink and had to get a new one."}
{"text":"The food is a little bit oilier than I'm used to, but still delicious. The restaurant itself is kept very clean, always. Also, the service has been excellent every time I've been to this location."}
{"text":"I am really happy that more restaurants have the lower calories menus now went here Sunday and they had a separate low Carrie menu. Since I belong to Weight Watchers but still like to eat out sometimes this helps me a lot Thanks"}
{"text":"Im giving this 2.5 stars . Went Monday night dec. 21, sat at the bar. I ordered an appetizer while waiting for a friend. This was at 430pm. My friend arrived at 5 pm and my app still hadn't arrived. The bartender went to check and brought it back with her. She said no one had brought it out. It was lukewarm as it had been sitting there a while.I then ordered the happy hour burger with a side of onion rings, side of bbq sauce, mayo and ketchup. The burger came plain with no onion rings. The bartender never put the order in for the rings. I had to ask for the mayo and ketchup as well. They finally did get the rings out and didn't charge me for them. The bartender apologized and was very nice, the burger was very good as were the rings. But the lack of attention paid left me with a bad feeling. I had never been to a cheesecake factory before and won't likely be back."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and years. But the last 3-4 times it takes FOREVER to just get drinks and takes even longer to get our food ! All we order is a chicken breast with steamed veggies ! Shouldn't take 45mins to a hour to get that food. Won't be coming back for a while until they change there kitchen staff. Takes way to long and the restaurant isn't even busy."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and the service inside is fine but take out is horrible! I've had many issues with being put on hold for 10 minutes and my order is wrong 90% of the time. I've started going inside and checking my order before I leave, so I can ask for the items they forgot. (Every time!) It's annoying because they offer curb side takeout but when they forget stuff, you have to wait for them to go back inside and get it. 

If I was rating the food, I would give them 5 stars but since I order takeout 95% off the time, my rating is based on the takeout service, which is lacking. 

They get super busy, pretty much every day of the week, so be prepared for a wait. They are open until midnight on the weekend and it's way less busy around 10pm."}
{"text":"Excelente localização e decoração maravilhosa, como nos demais. Cardápio muito diversificado e refinado. O Cheesecake então, nem se fale.

{"text":"Calorieake Factory, Henderson, NV

250 lbs - Drawn like fat little moths to our glittering temple....

If you're going to visit a restaurant that more than lives up to its reputation for dietary madness, go on an unrestricted night, because it's stupidly futile to observe gustatory rigor at The Caloriecake Factory. Their well-honed formula will suck dollars from your wallet and pack pounds on your waist. 

And it is a successful formula, at least as best I can tell: each dish is savory and well prepared if not totally inspired, and most spill over the sides of large plates. Gracious, competent staff, expensive drinks, and no room for dessert, which you will order anyway. 

Chicken Madeira: Heavy and comfortish, with nicely cooked chicken breast slathered in peas, carrots, heavy cream/chicken/cheese sauce, stacked on top of a George Foreman fist sized serving of creamy potatoes. Because this setup is too low carb, Caloriecake adds two standard sized buttery biscuits on top of all this, which is good because I totally didn't get enough bread before the meal. With butter. And beer. 

Total calorie weigh-in: 1650 for just the dish alone. 

Bacon-bacon burger: perfect sear over hot pink beef. Soft, sweetish french roll, fresh crispy veggies, and a joyfully disgusting amount of cheddar cheese and mayo. Man, what a good burger! Alas, sidekicked by fries with a sadly low crunch halflife. The fries could be better. 

Calories: 1500. This is so much naughty fun that it'll come with a hangover. 

Caramel Salted Cheesecake: 1000 calories for one slice. I'm laughing as I type this. 

Back on program tomorrow. The Caloriecake Factory adds just enough pleasure to your guilty to keep busting diets like belts. Go enjoy. Occasionally."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake factory has been open for a couple of months now so you would think that they would have it together by now. I know it was a Saturday night but every single thing arrived very slowly, food was just warm ,Steak Diane was good though! By the time our cheesecake arrived it was to go time. Don't need to come back."}
{"text":"Gotta say the food and service were excellent here. While yes this is a chain restaurant I do believe Cheesecake Factory in Las Vegas is one of the best places you can get a bite. My server Katherine was very friendly and attentive. 

Trust me if you walk in from the strip entrance you will take a nice walk through the Palace Shops and earn that bite to eat for sure."}
{"text":"Poor Customer Service. Waiters are rude and told me not to bring my baby's stroller inside and they let us sit outside just because we have a baby. Then I saw that other parents have their strollers with them. So I also did the same because I dont see anything wrong taking the stroller with me. We like the Rampart branch better. The waiter is just not friendly and they serve us cold bread. It was our first time in that location and it was really a bad experience."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we have been to the Cheesecake Factory. I think the quality has gone down over the years or maybe my taste has improved. 

We stopped in for a bite while shopping.   We got a salad which was gigantic.  The waitress was great. Very helpful. My wife always wants something changed and the waitress was more than happy to accommodate.  Nothing we asked for. Was unreasonable. The only bad thing about the salad was the quality of the tomatoes in the salad.  

I do not think they were cut fresh. I suspect they are food pack pre diced tomatoes because they were so bland and mushy. 

The four stars reflects the service we got. The food was more of a 2.5

We will definitely be back. Next time substituting the tomatoes for something else."}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday and it was truly a disappointing experience. 

I had a lunch portion of one of the pastas. There was three small pieces of chicken over powered by the mushrooms which tasted a little burnt.  The lunch portion appears to be around half the size for almost the full price. The portion size wasn't an issue since the food was not palatable. It wasn't a good value at all. 

My wife got a salad off the new light menu and it was basically just lots of lettuce. 

Service was slow. We had to ask for refills many times and were never offered a refill unless we asked."}
{"text":"Will never come back to this CF. waited for 1.5 hours for our simple curbside pickup order. Horrible service. No one knew what was going on.."}
{"text":"We were going to be in the area and my wife wanted to eat here. Wow, what a beautiful Resturant. We took the advice of another Yelper and ate dinner at another restaurant and stopped by for desert. It was around 2:00, and were seated immediately. As stated in another review the wait staff was indeed \"stuffy\", but that's ok. The Resturant decor is beautiful. We both had a drink,mixed to perfection. I decided to have the Ahi tuna Tatar appetizer, and we split a slice of 30th anniversary pie. The tuna was 1-3/4\" of avocado with 4 pieces of tuna, no bigger then the end of my little finger, on top. But that's ok. The Resturant is beautiful. The pie was the real hit, and was enjoyed to the last crumb. The bill for two drinks, 1 appetizer, and 1 slice of pie $38. When we left the Resturant we both busted out laughing. We couldn't imaging what the bill would have been if we had eaten lunch. By the way a slice of pie is just under $9.00. A whole pie is $$50.00. Again the Resturant decor is beautiful."}
{"text":"I visited on a Friday around 5:00 p.m had to wait in line for about an hour (just to get the beeper). After an hour we walked over to the next line only to find out that there were no beepers left and that we'd have to wait another hour to get our beepers. After finally getting our beepers we had to wait 3 more hours before we could get our seats. overall when we finally got the food it was very delicious loved it however it was not worth the wait. I'd say if you are planning on eating in the restaurant make sure you come very early for example come at 12:00 and you'll probably get in by 3:00 p.m 

I recommend the \"Evelyn's favourite Pasta\" and the \"Pork belly sliders\""}
{"text":"Same old same old. Loved this place 20 years ago. It always tastes great but we've learned to eat entrees and appetizers that are not sweet and loaded with sugar. So, though its always delicious we've found that by desert time we just really don't need more sweets! So we pass. 
This is still a very popular option for us and many others. Service is usually above average. Portions are usually quite generous though smaller than in years past."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat at. Every time we go on a vacation we always look for this place. The atmosphere is very nice and service is okay depending on location. This  is located at the end of Forum Shops at  Caesar Palace (where the animatronic show  begins every hour).  They have at least 18 pages (including a whole page of cheesecakes to choose from) on the menu with a variety of items to choose from. The waiter we had was very friendly and helpful in choosing the item she recommend. My mom and I both ordered Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane ($19.95 each)  and ordered caesar salad ($3 each). Our waiter brings our salad and  bread to our table. While I enjoyed the bread (especially the wheat bread) I didn't enjoy the caesar salad. The lettuce had bitter taste to it and the salad did not come with anything ( ex: cheese, onions, tomato,etc) that should be on it. I will say the ranch was delicious. About 30 mins later our waiter brought our entrees to our table.  The steak I had was tender and delicious and  the chicken Madeira
 with cheese was average. My mom thought her food was good also.  For dessert, I ordered the original cheesecake which was yummy! This place get pretty pricey ($60 was the check for  two of us) but was worth every penny.

I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas or when I'm  nearby one and would recommend those who haven't dine here to check this place out. It's something for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch or early dinner and Isaiah was our server, he just started his shift and he was absolutely amazing!!!! He never ever skipped a beat! I've worked in F and B and he is the guy that i would want training me or my staff. 
Thank you Isaiah you are pure perfection. 
Food was good too. Food is always good as is the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, but I am in Vegas with my kids and I wanted a child friendly place to eat.  This was a pretty good choice. 

We went there at 8 PM on a Friday night, and there was an anticipated 35 minute wait - but they gave us a piece of paper and told us to come back in half an hour.  That gave us time to check out the nearby stores and watch the \"Fall of Atlantis\" show right outside.  Unfortunately, it took an extra ten minutes before the anticipated time before we got seated and the kids were quite tired by then.

The prices were pretty reasonable. My Monterey burger came with cheese, onions, arugula and avocado an was $12, plus an extra one to substitute the fries with sweet potato fries.  The burger was good, though not as juicy as I'd like it (I ordered it medium rare), but the fries were phenomenal.  

My oldest had the pasta alfredo ($7), but she was disappointed by the lack of flavor.  Unfortunately our waiter was too busy so we seldom saw him and we couldn't ask him for Parmessan cheese before she was finished.  My youngest had the kids cheese pizza ($6), which was the size of a regular dinner plate - basically, adult size.  The pizza tasted like an Italian pizza margherita rather than your typical American cheese pizza, so she didn't like it.  I, however, did.  All the portions were large enough that we all took leftovers to our hotel (which fortunately has a kitchenette).

Of course, the only reason why the kids were willing to go to the Cheesecake Factory was the name, so we went on to have cheesecake.  The HUGE slices were $7 each, very reasonable IMHO, but I come from a city where food is grossly overpriced.  I had the Adam's Peanut Butter fudge cheesecake, and I would not recommend it.  It was way too sweet to allow for any cheesecake flavor to filter through.  My oldest had the Dulce de Leche cheesecake, which she enjoyed.  I liked it more than mine because it was less sweet, but next time I'll go for the plain cheesecake.  My youngest had the kids hot fudge sundae ($2!).  It was a large enough portion that she couldn't finish it.

In all, if you can deal with the wait and share dishes (or take the leftovers home for later), this seems like a good and reasonably priced place to dine in Vegas - no wonder there was such a huge wait!"}
{"text":"We waited a long time for a table to be ready. They were super busy so I understand that it would be slow. When we sat down, it took the waitress a long time to get out drink orders and to bring us refills and such. I ordered the Mac and Cheese burger and it was very good! The fries were really amazing too. I would recommend this place if you have plenty of time on your hands. Go Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Now I found my second favorite item on the 100 page menu. The truffle bacon cheese bread. It's delectable and delicious. I really coulda just had that - since it's was like a grilled cheese - an awesome high brow grilled cheese cut into 4 strips! I'm only giving 3 stars cause the pasta a order was ok. Basic. But my shrimp were terribly over cooked. Which I paid extra to add em. Live and learn."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've dined here but I thought it was worth mentioning. Very enjoyable. It's attached to Southpark Mall.  The atmosphere is surprisingly warm despite the just-under-montrous size of the restaurant; maybe it's the high ceilings that make it seem so big.  The menu is also big. If it's your first time, make time before you're famished beyond repair to browse the menu. They are gracious about making substitutions. They are smoke-free inside. When I first arrived in town 2 years ago, this was not the case. I'm happy to see places around town popping up with smoke-free air- fun for the whole family! There is also a bar area. They offer curb-side-to-go  - (704) 770-0915. It is crowded at peak hours. The wait staff has ranged from efficient to friendly to comedian (in a good way).  Oh yeah! They have a HUGE selection of cheesecakes! There are plenty of other dessert choices if you don't happen to like cheesecake.

Monday - Thursday 11:00 am - 11:00 pm

{"text":"Was picking up a to go order from here. Arrived at the time the order was supposed to be ready and went to the bakery to pick it up. Was told by the woman in the bakery that it wasn't ready yet and she would call us when it was done. Ended up waiting another half hour past the point when the food should have already been done. The same woman finally finished helping all the guests at the bakery and left to go get our food from the back. I have no idea how long it might have been done back there. She gave us our food without any napkins or utensils and left. We ended up having to ask another person there for those things.Will not be going to this Cheesecake Factory again."}
{"text":"Server Jamie was great and nicely changed the dry, greasy, tasteless fish taco with the Vietnamese summer roll which was ok. Never order the fish taco. Stick with the cheesecakes. That's why it's called Cheesecake Factory. Although, my granddaughter had ordered the Chicken di pana and raved how deliciously well made it was, so I guess your experience here really depends on what it is you ordered."}
{"text":"It's the Cheesecake Factory, initially I'm not a big fan because I've been there done that since high school back home in Chicago. However I have a teenager and this place ROCKS to teens so we end up here from time to time unfortunately.

When I'm forced to eat here I enjoy the small plates menu items which include the avocado rolls, salmon rolls & mushroom pizza. Our teenager ALWAYS indulge in the Buffalo Blast as an app and chicken tenders with fries as a main course. The hubby alternates between Jamaican Black Bean chicken and the Miso Salmon. I personally LOVE the Miso however this location is off on flavor and the whole Miso experience. 

It's pretty weird that Grand Luxe Cafe and Cheesecake Factory are owned by the same company. I prefer Grand Luxe as its much more upscale and the food options are better and much more tasty and presented better. Grand Luxe would've been a perfect fit for SouthPark mall, wishful thinking as I'm a Chicago girl and we have it ALL.

The dessert choices include the Lemon cake/cheesecake, the red velvet cheesecake and the chocolate cake.

Enjoy if you like 1,000's of confusing options and the pain of the mall traffic and long waits without the ability to make reservations."}
{"text":"I have been too this cheesecake factory twice now. Once to have..of course cheesecake, and the other to actually have dinner and a few drinks. 

The first experience was great, waitress was there when we needed her and we received our cheesecake in a timely manor and of course was amazing. 

The 2nd time there was very limited seating, we had ordered a appetizer and had taken our time with it, the table we were sitting at was big enough for if that, 2 plates. Our entrees had come and we were cramped for room, but as soon as a table opened up, the waiter was happy to seat us in a booth and move our food. 

I had the Hibachi steak which was a perfect choice. Rare like i asked, and full of flavor. 

overall, i am extremely happy with this place and hope not to have a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to work near one in Seattle and was somewhat of a regular.  After moving to Louisiana, I have to travel a minimum of five hours to get to one.  

On my way to Virginia over the holidays, we drove through Charlotte specifically so that we could go to CF.  

This location of CF is by far, the best I have ever been.  We had an awesome booth all the way in the back (read -- away from all the noise).  Our server was friendly and helpful. 

The food at this location was great!  Hot, huge portions and there was no skimping when we asked for extra sauce for our dishes (a must if you are a sauce freak like we are).

My daughter had her usual farfalle pasta (chicken, mushrooms, peas and some other stuff) and I had the chicken madeira (chicken, mozzarella, madeira sauce, asparagus and smashed taters).  It was all soooooooooooooo delicious!!  

We ordered one cheesecake -- the banana -- which is served with freshly sliced bananas.  It's now my second favorite to the lemon with raspberry glaze.  

When CF comes to Baton Rouge or New Orleans, my life will be complete.  Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I will be stupendously thrilled.

My recommendations --  Thai lettuce wraps (enough for a meal or appetizer to share) and then something from the specialties page, pasta or salad.  Skip the stuff that you can get anywhere any day of the week (burger)."}
{"text":"In my amazing experience at The Cheesecake Factory, I had the pleasure of enjoying the Roadside Sliders. These tiny exquisite burgers had the best ketchup I have ever had in my fourteen years on this earth.  I highly recommend eating here, even though the wait on a Saturday evening is 30 minutes. You can spend those minutes taking a stroll through the shops of Ross Park.  Oh and did I mention the ketchup? But besides that, the service here is very nice, and no one at my table had food left on their plates. The cheesecake here is no joke! Maybe that's why it's called the Cheesecake Factory? I got the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake and wow, I was planning on taking a photo of it to show the world it's beauty but I couldn't wait to devour the chocolate treat.  The best cheesecake ever, if you're a fan of mega chocolate delights then this will make you jump for joy.  Besides the food, the whole building is beautiful and well designed.  Overall my experience was one to remember!"}
{"text":"If you can't find something you love from Cheesecake's extensive menu, something is wrong with you. The white sangria was strong, sweet and delicious. 

Avocado egg rolls are perfect. Crispy exterior and soft flavorful interior. I like it dipped in their homemade ranch better than the sweet dipping sauce the egg rolls come with. 

Chili Rellenos were somewhat disappointing. The hot, melty pepper jack cheese inside is awesome, but the pepper has a very green pepper flavor rather than any spiciness. The crunchy fried outside is good but overall this was a miss for me. Not really worth the calories. 

The veggie burger was made with beets (along with brown rice, farro and black bean) and was not good at all. It was cold and sweet and bland. 

You can't go wrong with any of the desserts. We had the banana cream cheesecake, which is our standby favorite. And I also tried Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, made with layers of brownie, coconut cheesecake, chocolate cake, coconut frosting (similar to the topping for German chocolate cake) and whipped cream. It was good, but I've had better."}
{"text":"The only reason I'd come back here, is for the cheesecake, TO GO!

The other night a couple friends and I were craving dessert and cocktails so we sat down and ordered some cheesecake. My boyfriend had the vietnamese tacos which were supposed to be more like the \"bao sandwiches\" with the soft bao bread. 

--Well, it should have been soft bao bread but it was burnt and hard!! They served it to us like they didn't care to serve burnt bread.  SO DISAPPOINTING! 

I ordered the Kahlua cheesecake and a friend ordered the tiramisu. It wasn't that good, compared to other ones I've had (red velvet, Godiva, and strawberry) 

The service was OK. We had asked for some of that whole wheat \"chocolate bread\" and our server had told us that she would bring it out when it was done-- BUT she never did. I swear our server kept returning to our table, never mentioning the bread because I felt like she was trying to make us forget that we had asked for it. 

It frustrated me so I reminded her that we asked for it and she brought us two loaves. 

Another friend got a vanilla milkshake and it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"The service is really bad. Been sitting here for almost 20 mins and nobody's bring food yet. This has been a regular thing."}
{"text":"The wait was long on Wednesday night, we were sitting down looking at empty tables for 10 minutes before we were seated. Total wait time was 20 minutes though.

The bread they brought to the table was cold and hard and the butter was in individual packages equally cold. The food was good when we got it. I loved the LUAU SALAD. It was so delicious and plentiful. 14.95 is kinda high for a salad but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Actually, this was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory, and surprisingly, I wasn't that impressed with the food.  Maybe I didn't order the right dish. 

I ordered a fettuccine alfredo and it was just overall nothing special. I tried to eat as much as I could because it was the last meal before heading to the airport to go back home, and I'd get hungry if I didn't eat.  But anyway, I felt like I could've probably whipped up a better fettuccine alreado at home if I tried. On the other hand, I did like my boyfriend's pasta dish a lot more. 

We didn't get a cheesecake, since we were already full. (Well, I forced myself to eat as much as I could. haha) Hopefully, I'll be more impressed with another dish or just different location of the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time at this location. We came on a Saturday night and it was packed. We ended up sitting in the bar area to avoid waiting for a table. Although you typically don't get the best service at the bar tables that was not the case here! Bread was brought out and our orders were taken within minutes of sitting. We ended up ordering 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees & cheesecake and the total was around 80? which was expected. We specifically came to order the birthday cake cheesecake and were NOT disappointed!! :)"}
{"text":"Again this is another chain. You ate in one, you ate in all. If you like the place well you'll like this. If you don't well you won't!

It's decent priced and its packed again just like anything in South Park. Main reason I don't even want to go to the area. I'm honestly finding myself eating more and more home."}
{"text":"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience I have ever had. Avoid this location at all cost. The service from not only the wait staff but the manager was horrible. The food was less than average as well. I had to send my plate back because the cook had it extremely wrong. Then after speaking to the manager we had to request to have the meal taken off of our bill. The meal they messed up and we sent back. That should have been an obvious removal. How can you even think about charging someone for something they did not eat? Low class location stay away."}
{"text":"Always love the CF! Incredible how every time you go you find great staff. They know that huge menu so well! I appreciate that they allow me to substitute and create what I want when I order. Always excellent. It was packed out but we got in and out in an hour and a half."}
{"text":"First time ever dining at a Cheese Cake Factory! It's funny because there are two close to my residence but I go to Las Vegas to try it. It's in the the Cesar Forum shops right next to the Zeus Atlantis show. It's not a bad location and the surrounding is nice to look at!

Okay the food...wow. Their huge menu was off putting but the food I ordered silenced my apprehension. 

I ordered the portabella, avocado and zucchini appetizer. I never eat fried food but I'm happy I ordered it. Enjoy the finer, fattening things in life sometimes. 

My main dish was the fish tacos! Hell yes! I loved it! Fish was cooked perfectly and it came with black beans and rice. I was full by the end of the meal. Please try this place out and enjoy your time in a great city."}
{"text":"The hype is real. 

Coming to the mall on a Friday at around 1 for some Christmas shopping, I saw the line for The Cheesecake Factory and boy did I underestimate how long the wait would be. 

We decided to do some shopping first and then head down to eat around 6. The line had gotten longer and we were told that this particular line is just to get a receiver. Then the wait would be about 2.5-3 hours from there. We thought it was just an overestimate from their part.. it was not. 

During our wait, we made sure to know exactly what to order so we didn't waste any time. It was around 10:30 by the time we were seated. We were so close to giving up on waiting multiple times lol. 

The service was exceptional and prompt. Our waitress (I forgot her name) was very friendly and she checked up on us multiple times throughout the night. The appetizers, especially the stuffed mushrooms were super yummy! I had Evelyn's favourite pasta and I guess I always get sick of too much pasta, but it tasted good to begin with. 

The lighting is just so perfect. It's dim and creates a very cozy atmosphere. I wish it was slightly more spacious though. 

If you've never had cheesecake from here before, do yourself a favour and treat yourself. The white chocolate raspberry is my absolute favourite. 

I'll make it my mission to try every single flavour of cheesecake they offer."}
{"text":"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory... I grew up eating at the Brentwood location at least once a week & sometimes Marina Del Rey for a party etc. I now live away from Cheesecake territory so I get so excited for Pumpkin Cheesecake every year and am so excited when I can actually partake.... tonight we went to the Las Vegas Boca Park location for my dad's birthday (I swear the pumpkin cheesecake had absolutely nothing to do with choosing where to eat) and it was the WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Dirty silverware, our server didn't even know we were her table so we just sat there until we said something then we were pretty much invisible the rest of the time. Then topping off the experience we were told to pick a dessert to be brought to the table to sing 'happy birthday' but when the check came we were charged for it.  Our server was a very sweet person,  but regardless, whatever the reasons, we all left saying that we felt ripped off - the food was mediocre the service was shitty then that ... and it wasn't inexpensive. I don't think any of us are returning anytime soon and if I do it definitely will only be in L.A."}
{"text":"We usually time it perfect with great experience overall!!! Yesterday, Sunday afternoon about 4 not so good. Slow slow wait time. Two and half hours is too long to be in a restaurant. The server tried hard to make up for it. Hostesses need to step it up. Patio staff slamming plates on tables during set up annoying. Patio service needs work."}
{"text":"Same menu, service, etc. as any other Cheesecake Factory throughout the nation.  The only difference is that it's right next to that show that goes on in the Forum Shops with the fire and mechanically animated statues.  It was loud, hot, and annoying.  It freaked me out and we couldn't carry on a conversation for the 15 minutes that it was on.  My suggestion, if you eat here, is to sit inside to avoid the distraction of this show near the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had always seen The Cheesecake Factory at malls and never had a desire to have a go at it.  Though this passed week I was with family and they had so much good things to say about it, we decided on it for lunch.  
The menu had just about everything you could imagine.  The family and I Had a wonderful meal, the food was excellent with  something for everyone.  There was a variety of choices to pick from and the portions were absolutely monstrous.
The service was timely, well executed and gave us refills promptly.  We finished the meal with desert and man the cheesecake was outstanding.  If you are in the area and want a meal of what felt like an endless amount of food, you should give it a shot."}
{"text":"So full. So amazing. Would write more but I'm too busy continually stuffing my face. Second day of opening and the only thing that went wrong was that my side salad came with my meal. Not gonna complain about that!!"}
{"text":"Walked into cheese cake factory tonight, was immediately taken to our seats. Our server for the evening was Jon. His account of the menu as well as his excellent report with us, was just the beginning of a lovely meal. Our meals were fresh and served without waiting. A good time was had by all!"}
{"text":"A big fan of the cheescake factory. Love that this particular location wasn't crowded and there was no wait. I ordered the cobb salad which was unlike the typical cobb salad. It was big enough to feed about 4 people! Also ordered the slice of red velvet cheese cake which was excellent and was sized perfect for 2 people to share. Will definitely be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"We come here once a week for dinner. Tonight was horrible! It took an hr to get food and 45 min to get our drinks! The waitress was more focused on tables that had all men! The food was cold when it was delivered! Really disappointed. The waitress was really rude as well. Never have I ever received such bad service. Will not be returning any time soon"}
{"text":"First time into Cheesecake Factory. We were seated right away and our server Todd, was so very attentive!  We started out our order right with a Skinny Mojito and a Dirty martini and fried Calamari, maybe only 5 minutes after ordering i got out appetizer, the calamari was really good, the breading was light and delicious! I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits that had large chunks of cooked carrots, peas chicken laid on a tower of amazing mashed potatoes and smothered in Gravy! oh.. there were biscuits too. My husband got the Thai Chicken Noodles it looked really good. he said it would have tasted better if it was with shrimp but he still enjoyed it. The food was plentiful for the price. we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Looking for a dinner under $20 a person in Vegas? Try the Cheesecake Factory. If you can manage to make a decision from their huge menu (way too many options for me). I was very happy with my garlic noodles- and was really happy to save some cash on dinner after loosing some money on the tables. 
I left stuffed and happy with dinner and drinks- and our bill under $75!"}
{"text":"We sat in the bar for lunch. Julie, the bartender,  is awesome!  Exceptional service, which is hard to come by. Good food too."}
{"text":"Parking here is a real challenge with or without valet service. Huge selection of food,  overwhelming if I may say so. I don't like the fact that the food is not consistent. Same food tastes different on different days. 
Still good food and great dessert options"}
{"text":"I never ever eat at Cheesecake Factory at home because there is always an obscene line, but I was able to grab a table here.  I had completely forgotten how good this place is. The variety, quality and taste of the food is fantastic and the service was great too. I understand why people do actually stand in a long line to eat here."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday and it was a fun stress free evening with the family. I made reservations the day before for 5pm because the said they couldn't make it for any later. If I wanted a later time I would have to call back the same day. Any how we made it in time and had a pleasant experience. Staff were polite and attentive to our needs. Portions here did seem smaller than what we have become accustomed to for Cheesecake Factory. Went on a Monday evening, lots of elderly folks who wanted to chat, nothing wrong with that. Just we are trying to enjoy ourselves not get questioned about us being the biological parents of our children. I just may have to stick with the Scottsdale location in the future."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! I always get great service and the menu is HUGE. Their cheesecake is always delicious"}
{"text":"Food Great!
Location nice but hard to get to...
Parking - far away...
No reservation possible - Very unfortunate !!!!
Atmosphere 8/10
Service 8/10
All and All - recommended !"}
{"text":"Fun restaurant.  Has the most elaborate menu I have ever encountered!   Food is fun, love the grilled artichoke.  I recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here many times for lunch, and it is always a good treat. Services is shaky, sometimes great, sometimes horrible, but most of the time on the better end of things. 

I get the Chinese Chicken Salad each time, since it is something I know I will like and it is a full meal (the lunch portion), and it always comes out great. More chicken sometimes than the others, but overall good. 

My husband changes his mind up often, but gets the Sheila's Chicken Salad the majority of the time. Again, always consistent. 

We never come here for dinner because of the price, but do for their tiny-bit-discounted lunch meals. Their strawberry lemonade is delicious, but $5 for a drink that isn't alcoholic?! That seems insane to me..especially because any of their to-go drinks are in the tiniest of cups...a kids size. Their other drinks are in between $3 and $5, so none of the drinks are cheap, which is why I just decide to swallow the cash and spend the $5 on delicious strawberry lemonade.

Reason I gave only 3 stars is because the staff is never overly nice, place is clean most of the time, and food is always good. I just don't feel it deserves any more than 3 stars, but nothing really bad to say besides the overly prices food, but that's what you get for corporate food!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory several times before at this particular location.  Brought visiting granddaughter here today.  Bad move.
Ordered the chicken samosa appetizer, 4 small greasy wontons filled with chicken.  Doesn't anyone know how to fry anymore?  Why so greasy, pray tell? 380 degrees and they will be virtually greaseless.  These, were NOT.  I didn't complain. 
Ordered two red sangrias.  Sangrias came out with lots of ice (less Sangria) and very watery tasting.  I know good Sangria--it's in my genes---but this was NOT it.  Have you noticed that they don't give you the pricing on some of the drinks?  Well, my dear readers, these watery sangrias were $9.50 a piece plus tax and tip.  I will pay $15 for a good drink folks, but I hate being taken for a ride.  But I did not complain.  After all, I was taking a lovely guest out.  

Ordered one of my favorites, Fried shrimp in the basket with french fries and cole slaw.  Doesn't seem like such a big deal but when shrimp are freshly fried and delicious nothing beats them.  These, were NOT.  Something very strange with these shrimp.  Firstly, two different colors/tones (see photo).  I tasted the darker, flatter one first. Tasted like frozen shrimp from the supermarket, Carnation brand, or perhaps Sea-Pak?  The lighter, curlier shrimp tasted like it was pre chewed--no really.  It's just an expression but what I meant was that it was mushy inside.  Almost like a shrimp paste --they tasted like the precooked shrimp that come in a ring which were battered and then fried.  Very strange.  Granddaughter's theory was that the darker shrimp were leftover from someone else's plate and re-fried and served to me. Yuk at the thought).  I tried to eat them and ate two and then I said, why are you doing this to yourself?.  When our server, Dylan B, came around I couldn't help but to try to describe what the issue was with these shrimp.  I started with... \"I know you didn't cook this, but.....\"   Dylan B listened and apologized.   As we were about to leave a man (manager) came by to ask us how everything was.  I explained the shrimp fiasco.  He gave me an \"explanation\" or how when shrimp are fried and they stick together, one gets darker than the other.  Excuse me Mr. Manager, when was the last time you cooked a dinner?  I am quite a cook so Storytime Theatre didn't work for me.  Then he apologized and left.   Gee, everybody loves to apologize. apologies are cheap.  Is that part of their training?  As long as you apologize,  patrons can eat #######.  
I got the bill which amounted to $90.  No accommodation for the horrible meal I had or for the fact that I didn't even have dinner.  No small credit for the lousy shrimp, no slice of cake to make up for it nada, Nyet.  
So for $90, I had inedible shrimp, coleslaw overridden with mayonnaise, two watery Sangrias and greasy Samosas.  
My husband enjoyed his Chicken Marsala and that's why the ONE star.  
Not good, Cheesecake Factory, Not good."}
{"text":"We came here for my brother's birthday. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory here but this was my first time here as a vegan. Our waiter was really nice and helpful. She answered all my questions and went back to the kitchen to ask about my food allergies. I really appreciate everything she did, they just didn't have many options. I was hungry so I wanted avocado toast or a pasta but their bread and pastas have eggs baked in. One of their complimentary breads was eggless so our waiter brought a basket of that for me which was so sweet. I ended up ordering the falafel sandwich without any cheese. I didn't like it very much. The falafel did not taste very good, it was really mushy and tasted kind of sour. We had really good service and my family liked their food, but it wasn't good for vegan options. I don't think I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"5 stars from my picky eater son. He loves the Alfredo Chicken Pasta and I love the Skinny menu....a win for us both!"}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times and last night was the first time I've been even slightly disappointed - first waiting an outrageous amount of time for appetizers and then getting what looked like the chicken lettuce tacos instead of the Thai lettuce wraps.  

However, the menu is freaking giant and the food is always delicious.  I tried the tuna tataki salad last night because it is one of the healthiest things on their menu and I was not at all disappointed.  My husband's tomato and basil pizza left a LOT to be desired, though.

This is a great place to take people that have weird likes and dislikes because of their huge menu.  If you can't find something you'll like here, you just straight up have issues."}
{"text":"Food- Same as any other Cheesecake Factory.  My issue with this particular location is that they have a number of a-holes working there.  They walk by and make snide comments while you are eating. 

I was there once at closing- the waitress (who was great) was a little slow with the check and I was admittedly slow giving it back, so by the time I got it back, they were officially closed.    I sat to calculate the tip and two guys come by to clean the table next to mine and remark loudly \"Man, where did the music go? Oh that's right, we're CLOSED!\"

That whole thing was completely unnecessary, and the worst is that the manager was there and said nothing.  I've worked in food service and retail, so I get it, but I have never shopped anywhere, eaten anywhere, or worked anywhere where people acted like that.  

I complained to the manager about it today and he was very much apologetic, which I appreciated-hence the three stars instead of two."}
{"text":"Mom had just got out of her surgery and was hungry. she hadn't eaten all day. So I had suggested Cheesecake factory. I know she loves to cook for me. But she had just had eye surgery and you have to treat your mom. So we went. We arrived and it must have just been before the dinner rush. We got seated right away. Soon after we saw lots of people coming in. The place was getting full . Mom didn't want a lot. She was saving herself for some pie. she ordered the nachos app. and a salad. the side salad was great but the nachos were over whelming for her. Her eye got really big. she knew she couldn't finish them. As a good son I helped put a nice dent to it. I gat the spicy chicken pasta with asparagus. It was great. I almost didn't want to get a piece of pie. But we were here. And we were an hour away form home. Not chance on taking that home. So we got a piece. Each. Yup she went with the favorite. Fresh strawberries on top of her pie. I went with the Apple strudel. It was amazing like always. Are plates were great proportion. The pie was also great. Our waiter gave us great service. Had mom laughing . Over all they made me look great. Mom was pleased and full. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying we are HUGE fans of the Cheesecake Factory ! They have amazing Food with a great all around selection of dishes , desserts and appetizers!! We have been going here since it has opened and in no way will we stop going and or want anyone reading this to be discouraged of going as well !! 

Tonight we decided to go during HAPPY HOUR to have a couple drinks, dinner and spend some time together as a couple ! Our service was an issue from the start with a very slow start ! We ordered our drinks and something was floating in my wife's drink and we asked for another one ! We watched very closely to ensure that she received a fresh drink and this time the glass was dirty ! Third one was the charm although she really on drank one drink !! My beer on the other was tasty but and hour later finally received my second ! 

The waitress was nice and we did give her some feedback and I must say she had enough courage to tell her manager without us asking ! The first manager approached us and was full of excuses from the start blaming Happy Hour - For real , you have happy hour the same time everyday and a manager should never Make Excuses !! They had 2 bartenders three servers and a manager with less than 50 people to wait on ! Later on in the evening Dawn , another manager came to our table and took full responsibility and apologized 100% with no excuses giving us a 6.00 discount ! We were not looking for anything but I must say overall a disappointing experience this time around !!"}
{"text":"Typical American Fare, good food great atmosphere food is more of generic not really known for Signature Dishes."}
{"text":"Hey Hey Hey Az I gave this place a two star rating today not because of the service or ambience , that's always great ! My disappointment was with the quality of the food . Today's order was Shelia's  Cashew Chicken Salad and the soup of the day . Tomato basil chicken tortilla soup. On the menu Sheila's Cashew Chicken salad sounded great but when it was received it lacked lusciousness . Chicken ? Hardly any and it was shaved not chucks . It called for avocados and they were MIA\" !  All I tasted was a mouth full of crispy tortilla chips . The soup of the day was tasteful but the chicken in the soup was \"MIA as well . What the heck . At the end of the day it was just mediocre and I was going for \"WOW\"."}
{"text":"Food was nice and tasty as usual.  A bit on the expensive side, but that's to be expected.  Only complaint would be a slightly longer wait time for the food to be delivered.  Other than that, no issues."}
{"text":"It was our first night staying at Caesars and I was a bit worn out from the drive, so I didn't feel like going too far for dinner. At about 8:30 we went into the Forum Shops area and found a number of places that looked good. One of the last we ran across was the Cheesecake Factory. We didn't want anything that fancy and had dined at different Cheesecake Factory restaurants many times so we decided that this would be fine. We ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a Pizza.

While we were waiting, all of a sudden, loud throbbing music filled the indoor courtyard. We asked the server what was going on and were told that the Nike store next door was having a promotion or kick-off of some sort. The music was a non-stop throbbing `new-age' sound which was NOT pleasant.

The Pizza was eventually served, but w/out the Chicken Caesar salad. While sharing the pizza, the music suddenly stopped. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! Within just minutes there was an explosion and flames coming from the top of the aquarium in the center of the indoor courtyard. Then large animated figurines rose from amidst the flames and went into a `skit' for the people on the other side of the aquarium. It, too, was almost deafening w/ continued explosions and background sounds. As it was directed away from us we could not make out the dialog, just the explosions and screaming.

Well, we're on our second piece of pizza and the manager comes to the table stating that the Chicken Caesar salad would be a bit longer. I told him to forget it. He asked if I was sure and I replied, 'yes'. So, as we're starting our 3rd (and last) slice of pizza... out comes the Chicken Caesar salad. Plop... not a word... and the server (not our waiter) walks away. I nibbled at it, but wasn't that hungry and left most in the bowl.

Just as we are about to ask for the check the `skit' ends. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! The Nike noise returns... along with the check which includes the Chicken Caesar. I run down the server and recant my conversation w/ the manager. He says he'll look into it and after about 5 minutes returns with the check w/o the Chicken Caesar. At this point all we wanted to do was leave, so we didn't wait for change, leaving a 25%+ tip for service worth about 10% and an experience worth avoiding."}
{"text":"Chocolate cake was cold and hard.  Was it old? No herb tea. Water never refilled.  I was very let down.  Waiter polite but not attentive enough."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? I mean seriously, it's a factory that produces cheesecake! We love it!!"}
{"text":"The best Miso Salmon in town. 
The service is excellent too. 
If you're into sweets go for the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake :-)"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to echo what other reviewers are saying about the initial quality of this Cheesecake Factory. We had an early dinner (3:00pm) on a Sunday. The hostess was bossy, clicking her long nails on the counter to tell us where to stand while we waited to be seated. The server was friendly, but forgot to give us a napkin and the service was so slow. The food was fine but they need to iron out their act."}
{"text":"Our server was terrible. Couldn't get the order right and even when he though he had it right, he brought a burger instead of the salmon... They never refilled our drinks, and in general took an extraordinarily long time. It took us an hour and we are fast eaters. Good is very inconsistent. This is our third time here ordering the same dishes and they taste different each time... Worst cheescake factory I've ever been to"}
{"text":"I've been to different Cheesecake Factories before (in different states) and I don't remember the food being quite so terrible. My party and I ordered the fried macaroni balls and bacon wrapped dates as appetizers, shepherd's pie, a sandwich and salad combo, and Evelyn's favorite pasta as the main entrees, followed by the strawberry shortcake for dessert.

Appetizers: 

The fried macaroni balls were pretty good, but how can you go wrong with fried stuff and cheese?

The bacon wrapped dates were NOT good. I've had this dish before (at other restaurants) and have never seen the dates stuffed with parmesan. Bad choice. I love cheese, but the parmesan did not go well with the other flavors. Also, the bacon and the dates were all burned when they came out. We debated whether or not to send them back, but we were so hungry it didn't seem worth the wait for four little dates.

Entrees: 

The shepherd's pie was way too salty and the not at all like a traditional shepherd's pie. It was overloaded with mushrooms and not enough of other vegetables. And I don't understand why the carrots in the shepherd's pie were julienned? It seemed like a poor effort at adding flash at the expense of substance.

You'd think you can't really go wrong with a sandwhich and salad, but the bread on the sandwhich was rock hard and actually painful to eat.

Evelyn's favorite pasta dish was ok, but I think for the price it could have included a larger quantity of vegetables.

Dessert:

The strawberry shortcake was okay, but to be honest, I've had better. I did like how they included MOUNDS of strawberries with the dish!

Overall, the dishes were overpriced, the portions were big, but the quality was poor. I do have to say that the service was good and the atmosphere was decent, but I definitely will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"The food is ok at this restaurant, but in my opinion is quite overpriced and not worth the massive lines that are ALWAYS there.
But what IS worth the wait? THE CHEESECAKES! You will wait about 20 minutes (expect to add to that on a Saturday night) to order and receive your cheeaecake, but it is soooooooooooo worth the wait. They have at least 30 different varieties to pick from (which makes for a few minutes of intense anxiety when deciding) and I haven't had a bad one yet! 
Take my advice, go eat your meal somewhere else and take the money you save and then come here and buy extra slices of this heavenly cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I normally avoid chain restaurants but because we were shopping all day at Legacy, our tired legs were ready to bell up to the bar and have a few drinks and eat some grub.  On a weekend night be prepared to wait a long time (upwards of an hour).  We luckily scored two seats at the bar and sidestepped the wait.  The Blueberry Mojito was killer good.  Super refreshing and not overly sweet.  Bar service was very friendly and fast.  And kudos to the CF for having a lighter fare menu...nicely done.  I opted for the beet and goat cheese salad and a side of macaroni and cheese.  The citrus vinaigrette on the salad was delicious.  The macaroni and cheese was VERY disappointing...it was swimming in oil and bland.  And it was coated in bread crumbs that tasted like old oil.  If the bar would install hooks to hang your purse on, that would be great."}
{"text":"Wonderful service yesterday ! Walked in at 11:30 and did not have to wait at all. Service was amazing, food was good. Oreo cheesecake was the BEST ! Great experience overall !"}
{"text":"The chicken samosas were bomb. The bread is dangerous because it's so good. Great place for drinks and hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Love this place. The salmon is excellent, the herb crusted salmon with mashed potato and asparagus is my personal favorite! Wide variety to choose from."}
{"text":"it was an extremely long wit for a seat here at lunch (it always is) but their food is large portioned, decently priced and classic american fare. My friends LOVE their pasta and were happy with their creamy choices while my chicken tacos were good, but not amazing. The avocado was brown and the shells broke with the amount of salsa they put at the BOTTOM of the tacos...

Service was also extremely slow and we were hardly attended to but the tiramisu cheesecake is probably my new favourite! Not too heavy, plenty of cake and coffee flavour too!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and I am never disappointed with the food or service. Ive had the burgers and salads and both were delicious. And of course the cheeesecake is magnificent!!! I always tell people whenever they go they have to get the cheesecake.... it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory is located inside Caesars Palace and is absolutely beautiful! Eat outside if you can. We had no wait and our waitress was very accommodating. I ordered the Mexican Tortilla salad- delicious and fresh. As an appetizer we had the basil, mozzarella, tomato flatbread- also good but small. My boyfriend ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken- very tasty! Lunch portions are great. Of course we ended with Cheesecake and requested the key lime- tasted fresh and sweet and perfectly tart. Try the tropical iced tea too."}
{"text":"V E G A N S R E A D!!!
Okay so it's been a while since I've been here and I've been vegan for two years now. Anyways we came for dinner tonight and our waitress was so nice with us. I wanted bread so I asked the manager oh do you know what kind of bread this is. He said yes it's sourdough and whole wheat (I think he said whole wheat but Igs was wheat something) and then I said okay cool thanks and he asked if any of us had any dietary issues. I said I was vegan and he instantly knew what he was talking about. He said the whole wheat one aka the brown bread was not because it contained sugar. 
Personally, this is above and beyond knowledge because This is some deep vegan shit. And he knew it and it amaze me. Anyways I had such a pleasure being there and it made our girls night so much better. Thank you to the knowledgeable manager and the wonderful staff."}
{"text":"The one main reason I love Cheesecake Factory and the USA. PORTIONS!!! The food and service here were great!!! Price was reasonable. Did not disappoint on the dessert. Can't wait til Cheesecake Factory opens here in The 6 at Yorkdale"}
{"text":"So the hype is not worth the wait for this place. The service was great, our waitress was very attentive and helpful. We had too much stuff on our table and my full glass of wine fell, to which the immediately came and cleaned it up and replaced it (free of charge) which I was not expecting.

I got the chicken tacos and my friend got the chicken enchiladas.

The chicken in my tacos were dry, and my friend just got back from Mexico didn't enjoy their food either. It was very bland.

My honest advice would be to just wait in the front for the individually sliced cheesecake. Beats having to eat unflavoured food."}
{"text":"Went out for a date night, which was going well until my very last bite. Chomping down on what I thought was the end of a lovely dinner turned into disgust as I realized that something in that bite wasn't food. Never really figured out what that plastic piece was, but the end of dinner was pretty well ruined for me at that point. The waitress was very apologetic, but the manager never came out to apologize and just comped my own meal."}
{"text":"I have had their cheesecake before. It's nothing to write home about. You can find better at Yorkville. 

The Cheesecake Factory has \"American\" written all over it. The portion size is on the morbidly obese side. Anyone who's goal is to ruin their body with fried chicken between monster waffles with maple syrup and hollandaise sauce would love this place.
I had the \"best\" French Toast (see photo). Believe me, it wasn't \"the best\". The best French toast was at a B&B up north years ago. Compared to all the other American portion sizes that is served at The Cheesecake Factory, the French toast must have been the smallest. They basically searched my the same bread that was delivered to my table but cut larger and dipped in batter. So basically, I ate eight pieces of the same bread for breakfast. 
My wife had the plain pancakes. Thank Jesus the nice waitress allowed her to order the kids size. Their is no way she would have finished the fat American size! She took one bite an said \"That's enough. This is just garbage!\"
I tried some and realized that I can taste the starch, so much so, that it coated my mouth and can feel the stuff all over my tongue and teeth! Disgusting!

The price was outrageous for the quality of food. The price for portion size is ok. But quality.... uh.. not so much. 

The Pickle Barrel is right beside this fat farm and the food is much better!

That was the first and last time I'm going to the Cheesecake Factory!

The only saving grace was that I was not with all those other mindless \"zombies\" lining up for two hours. I arrived with my wife at 10am and was seated immediately.
I would have been pissed if I was actually stupid enough to lineup for two hours for the meal I just ordered. 

It made me sick!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this location! The service is amazing and everyone is really friendly and helpful. I highly recommend trying the passion martini or Cosmo because both are delicious. The menu is HUGE. This is the type of place where there is something for everyone. Call ahead to get wait times. You can always shop in the forum while waiting."}
{"text":"WARNING: CHEESECAKE FACTORY DOES NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS, SO PREPARE TO WAIT AT THEIR MERCY. On a late December 2013 night at Boca Park Cheesecake Factory, we were welcomed by shrieking toddlers (the kind of piercing, high-decibel sound that raises blood-pressure among the most minimally sentient humans) and boys big enough to know better who were treating the waiting area like a playground and endangering anyone who enters the place. There ought to have been some professional supervision to protect the other customers from those rowdy rascals. Our dinner companions chose to wait the forty minutes for a table--but outside, so that we could avoid the wanton pandemonium inside the restaurant. We had one good experience at this location a few months ago, thus figured that it was worth the wait. IT WAS NOT.


Our waiter was pleasant enough, but we had to constantly ask him for water-refills and he did not offer freshly-ground pepper to me for the infinitesimally small sirloin steak \"culotte\", though he did so for my sister's Caesar salad. Spotty at best was the waiter's service, and after we finished our entrees, the fellow waited a full hour before presenting us with the dessert menu. The bread basket held something white, and I inquired whether or not it was sourdough, with which I have been familiar  all my life. The waiter said \"yes\". Upon tasting it, one could not detect a single sour note, and this eatery-chain is based in California, where sourdough bread is ubiquitous! I was disgusted by the formerly frozen, inadequately cooked \"French fries\" that came with my pee-wee steak, and its two substandard onion rings. There was a paper cup on the plate that contained ketchup, of all things. Had the waiter returned, I would have asked for a suitable condiment (give the dish a French name, and you had better include Dijon mustard, not the risible, flavor-masking ketchup). The fries were \"immangeable\", to use a derogatory French word that means \"inedible\". And at around twenty-five bucks, a microscopic, pathetically thin steak is an insult to anyone with a sense of proportion. There was one high note on the table: an appetizer called Buffalo Blasters. Without them, I may have gone hungry--oh, the irony in a place with one of the longest menus in creation.


My husband had the usually fail-safe dish, fettuccine Alfredo. He perceived that the noodles were old or reheated. I noticed that the \"sauce\" was too thin to adhere to the pasta, and that the dish had been inappropriately infused with raw garlic, a vile act which constitutes sabotage. We detest the stinking tuber, and would never order such a thing knowingly.  It's a crime to call a dish \"Fettuccine Alfredo\", which NEVER had garlic in it, and turn the unsuspecting customer into this week's Garlic Clown, who has people running helter-skelter from his reeking person. An honest name for the concoction would be, \"Noodles in Raw Garlic Soup with a Hint of Cheese\". You cannot bastardize a recipe this way! Poor Chef Alfredo of Rome--his recipe has become a clown show in a bowl.

A slice of chocolate mousse layer-cake was dry, heavy and seemed days-old. My cappuccino was lukewarm upon arrival. The only positive thing about the evening at Cheesecake Factory of Boca Park was the company at our table. I submit mostly five-star reviews here at Yelp; because I don't like to shoot at ambulances, I refrain from offering negative reports. However, when a huge chain restaurant serves factory-food at boutique prices, I am duty-bound to say so. And when one looks longingly at a Jack in the Box sign on the drive home after dinner, something is very wrong."}
{"text":"Wait was shorter than expected but service was disappointing. Salad entree was served missing ingredients, ordered cheesecake to go and they gave me the wrong one (but I paid for the more expensive one) and they never brought plastic forks requested."}
{"text":"They have a broad menu, if you can't find what you like maybe you should not have come.  Prices are subject to tastes; the better the taste, the bigger the price but worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on the large commercial restaurants but I like to give credit where credit is due. Cheese cake factory is a step above the other box restaurants. The sheer variety of cuisines they offer is a kitchen marvel. The quality to price is fair. Service is usually held to a standard far above the price point. And of course, the cheese cake is to die for."}
{"text":"Went in for a late night snack w/ the sisters.  We were seated right away.  Our server was very nice and helpful.  One thing I really appreciated was our glasses were filled the entire time we were there.  Highly recommended and will be back whenever I'm around"}
{"text":"My last visit was on a late Friday evening after a few hours of shopping. We arrived super thirsty and were seated right away, in a table close to the bar area. We waited more than 15 minutes and I finally went up to the bar to ask for water. Well, the waitress delivered it to the wrong table, so I had to go back and ask again. Really unacceptable to have to wait 20 mins for water - let alone taking an order. While I only ordered dessert at this visit, it's a chain restaurant - the food is nothing special. The lemon meringue cheesecake was very good. It was a big portion- even with 2 helpers we didn't finish it. Overall the service is poor - it's an adequate place to grab dessert if you're not short on time."}
{"text":"We decided to come to this location instead of the one in Henderson since it was closer and we thought we would have a nice experience. 
Little did I know that we would have a really bad table.  
We had about 1 1/2 feet or room from the table to the left and when the gentleman on that table decided to step away for a moment his rear end ended up on my boyfriends food plate. 
I had to move quickly to avoid the waiter hitting my face with his elbow when he brought the food to the other table and to make things worst as I used my spoon to try the salsa for my tacos there was a dried up piece of food on it, didn't see it since its a bit dark inside. 
We had to laugh since the food was great 
But had to yell at each other since the table to my left was so loud and to make things even more interesting, the gentleman on the left started to pick his nose. 
What a great way to have a date night."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is wonderful but the service was incredibly slow. We waited at least 15 minutes to get drinks and bread at the beginning and then we got half of our meals after what seemed like a pretty long wait. It took another ten minutes to get two more plates delivered. The final plate, however didn't arrive at our table until after we'd all finished eating. The manager did comp the seriously late plate, and it's easy to forgive a missed order but the overall slowness of the servers leads me to leave this one star review."}
{"text":"Honestly amazed at their customer service. The food has always impressed me at The Cheesecake Factory and I've been to many. This time was no different, loved it and now they're serving a complete gluten free menu so I can take my gluten sensitive loved ones along with me! It is impossible to give The Cheesecake Factory less than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I went to Cheesecake Factory for my one year anniversary. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp thinking that it would be Spicy but it was sweet. Too sweet! I took two bites and are half of my wife's meal. The server was rude from the get go, giving us a dirty look because we didn't want an appetizer. After an hour of us sitting there she came by and saw that I didn't eat my food. She asked why I didn't eat and I said it was too sweet. She asked if I wanted something else and I said no. It had already been an hour and I had eaten half of my wife's food. When I got the bill I realized she left my dish on there. I was already mad so I paid it and vowed never to go back. I left an email of my experience at the corporate website and still haven't gotten a reply. If that's how they do business, screw them."}
{"text":"I understand the wait times being anew location best time to go is early sat in the bar ceaser salad was incredible very tasty chicken Marsala delicious with the pasta bow ties loved to top it off the 30 year signature cheesecake so so good was so excited when I heard they were coming to Toronto it will be my second home"}
{"text":"The food taste great, the portions are too large.  Servers are hit and miss.  Service is usually fair to slow.  Why is it that EVERY time I eat there I lose ten pounds in the bathroom within hours of eating there!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to have a belated Valentines dinner and everything was great! Our server Jenny was phenomenal! She went above and beyond to making this date perfect! Service was prompt. The food was cooked perfectly. I ordered the Miso Salmon with brown rice and I do recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing services here. Food was amazing and delicious. The portions are huge so if you're a person who doesn't have a big appetite, share a dish with someone. Waiting took an hour and half long because it just opened couple days ago and it's the first location to open in Canada. However, they give you a buzzer and u can go shopping in the mall while waiting for your table. The staffs will explain more about how the waiting will work. Staffs are really nice and friendly. Definitely will go back again after 90 days of the opening date because then they will start accepting reservations."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has a very large menu and the food is always very good. The serving portions are generous. The servers are friendly and pleasant. We frequent this location often and it's always busy. We like eating here but..................

The cons:1)  On my last visit over the weekend, it was the first time I used the restroom. If I had to rate the restroom facility using 'stars', it would get a 2. I was dumbfounded. For the size of  the restaurant, the restroom was small. Very dark, very dirty and wet (floors and counter). There were two other patrons in there and we all commented on how bad it was. Everyone was really surprised about it.

2) Parking isn't great either."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad off the \"superfood\" menu that proclaimed to have a plethora of nutrious goodness and ended up in a bowl fit for three people comprised mostly of iceberg lettuce. Dissapointing. The service was slow, too. 

However, I also got an avacado tartare, don't remember which fish was used. That was adorable and tasty but it had waaaay too much soy sauce that was not on the side and included hella fattening pita chips, a classic American adulteration of something supposed to be so pure, gah. It was tasty, though."}
{"text":"Awesome food which is expected from any location of this restaurant. I come here often for special occasions to get pasta and my favorite cheesecake, if you don't mind horrible service then it's ok!
Every visit I have here is unpleasant but if the food wasn't so good then I wouldn't come back. Staff is on their phones. Servers are very slow and unattentive. Hosts don't greet or seem friendly even on busy weekend evenings. For a higher up restaurant in a nice location you would expect more. But on the plus side the bread, food, and cheesecake = heaven!"}
{"text":"Great as always. I'm forever recommending their Ceasar Salad, fried mac and cheese balls, and Red Velvet Cheesecake. The only flaw is their seating. If you're upstairs near the railing, be careful. There's nothing covering the fence part, so if you drop a knife (as I did) you /will/ hit someone. Luckily, it landed between her back and the booth but still. They need to fix that. After the incident, the manager just told me to keep my silverware away from that side to avoid another mishap. 

That mishap would never happen again if they fixed that, but still. Always A+ food no matter the location. The staff is super friendly. :)"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here the food is good. I know they have cheesecake factories everywhere, but im a big fan of cheesecake, I like the variety they have, and it always tastes great.  I came here a couple months ago for lunch, and had the lousiana chicken pasta. It came out great. Although, the slice of cheesecake I had, seemed smaller, then what they served at the one at Caesars Palace. Then again, its been about a year since I ate at that one, so things might have changed, and they are cutting down the portions."}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger without the bun with a salad and it was great! Perfect option for my diet!"}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant a few times and have had pretty good experiences. I've come to learn to not be too adventurous with the menu - they have some really good options & some not too great choices so I'm starting to stick to the meals I know I like. As far as drinks go, the Tropical Martini, Georgia Peach, & Prickly Pear Margarita are a few of my favorites. For the main dishes, I really like the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, Pasta DaVinci, and the Santa Fe Salad. I'd say that this is a restaurant that's somewhat overpriced but the quantities but the quantities are really large. I'd prefer it if you could order their main dishes in half sizes at a lowered price. The Godiva cheesecake, Vanilla Bean cheesecake, & Fresh Banana Cream cheesecake are also worth trying. Keep in mind that if you're going in a large group, they don't do reservations so on a weekend night, expect a long wait!"}
{"text":"Had dinner after a long drive to Vegas and was pleasantly surprised. We were seated right away no wait. Then our waitress was super quick to get drinks and our apatizer came out in like 2 minutes delicious. Food took about 20min which was ok because other service had been so excellent. Reesees peanut butter cheesecake to die for! Would definitely go again and reccomend!"}
{"text":"Average American food. Nothing striking good. Thai lettuce is good. Calamari is great. Lunch menu is more reasonable than dinner."}
{"text":"Your classic Cheesecake Factory.  All of the food items I've ever had here were good, exactly what you'd expect from the Cheesecake Factory.  I love the location in Southside Works, close to shopping and other nightlife.  The service has always been great here too.  Overall, a good experience and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Too dark to read the menu. 

The foods are alright. Everything is very slow.... But the check... 

Will not come back again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. My husband and I went out with a gift card from my daughter for my birthday. We had not been there before so was a bit excited. The waitress soon took that away by just doing a minimal job. Didn't ask if we were there before just the whole experience was nothing to write about.
The catfish my husband had was okay at best. My bugers bun was a mess I left 3/4 on my plate. No one even asked what was going on. If it was good.
My birthday dinner was a flop. Thanks for nothing cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"We decided on The Cheesecake Factory for our latest date night.  When we arrived it was obviously busy and was told it would be a 30 minute wait, which was fine as we wanted to do a little shopping anyways.  The wait was closer to 45 minutes so by the time we got seated, we were starving.  We waited another 10 minutes or so for our server to take our order.  We ordered our drinks (JW's Pink Lemonade for me, and a Modern Old Fashioned for my husband) as well as an appetizer (Chicken Taquitos).

The Taquitos were good, almost an exact twin to the Firecracker Chicken Wraps at Longhorn.  My drink was super delicious, but if I had known it was going to be $10.50 (their prices aren't on their menu for cocktails), I probably would have ordered something else.  We ordered our meals (Chicken and Biscuits for me, and Thai Coconut Lime Chicken for my husband) and they arrived promptly.  One of my biscuits was very overdone, borderline burnt, but otherwise my meal was good, and my husband enjoyed his as well.

We were in and out in about 45 minutes, which is pretty good for a very busy Friday night.  The bill was a shocker though; I had no idea the drinks were that expensive (about $43 of the bill was just drinks), nor was I wanting to spend nearly $100 on dinner that night.  If the service was amazing and the food was spot on, then I could see it warranting that price."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Six of us came here today (as in I'm writing this from the table) and it took nearly an hour to get our meals. When our meals came out, one of the heuvos rancheros was really undercooked. We sent the meal back and it took another 20 minutes to get it back. Although the manager came over, he didn't apologize or anything. He just said, it will be out in two minutes...and it took another 8-10. In addition to this debacle, drinks took forever to come out and they forgot to give us basic condiments like syrup for our french toast. This was a really horrible experience. I think the manager and our waitress (Patricia A.) should be fired for incompetence and poor customer service."}
{"text":"The order came out wrong and instead of them replacing the meal the server brought the missing ingredients... WRONG!!!!! Secondly a manager never came to the table to explain or apologize; I personally asked to speak to one. His explanation was that there was a new hire working in the kitchen .... Uhhhhh, okaaaay.... Anyway, Cheesecake Factory BAD on you and thanks for not comping even the $8 cheesecake slice. For your lack of consideration I am not ever returning to this location. Just a total shame because I love CF."}
{"text":"Normally, service here is excellent. But tonight? FAIL. We're regulars at the Scottsdale location; it's walking distance from home!  Well tonight we waited quite a longer time than usual for our dinner. Even the manager came over to apologize as well as our waitress. No offer of a discount on our bill, free desert, nothing! We're not the type to be verbal, but when both the mgr and waitress are aware of an issue, and does nothing for the customer....thats an even bigger disappointment. :("}
{"text":"Valet parking now takes half the entire mall parking (all the restaurant side.)  paying for parking when the entire mall parking lot is 45% full rubs me wrong.  The food was good."}
{"text":"When we did not take a table outside tonight with the possibility of rain they put us back on the list but not the tip of list"}
{"text":"Huge improvement over the last few years. 

I have been to different Cheesecake Factories.  Upon first visiting this location in the District, I wasn't impressed.  After giving them another shot, I was pleasantly surprised of the vast improvement of service and food.  

Service here has been very attentive and friendly.  Drinks are refilled and food is served promptly.  Even the girls at the hostess station are more welcoming.  

The food dishes such as the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is becoming my favorite dish served here.  There are plenty of chicken and shrimp surrounding the rice.  The spicy Thai sauce is filled with flavors of curry, peanut, chile and coconut.  Every bite is delicious.  

Of course it's hard to leave here without ordering cheesecake.  It is an extensive variety to choose from.  I have yet to try one I didn't like.  Plus the slices are so huge and easily split with someone.  

I'm happy to say I'll be back soon for more."}
{"text":"I really love the Cheesecake Factory. I know the menu is huge but that means I never go to the same restaurant twice! My favorite is the grilled eggplant sandwich. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is also always a perfect choice. As for dessert...the tiramisu is fabulous. The only reason they are not getting five stars from me is that at this location, I have had crappy service twice. Indifferent servers who really seem to think they have something better they could be doing. The food though, always great. This is probably my favorite chain restaurant. The ice green tea they added to the menu about a year ago is so refreshing on a hot summer day and the best part...free refills! Love the green tea."}
{"text":"Good place with a huge variety in the menus. Convenient location, friendly stuff. Foods are great. The only not so good is that they almost always are busy so be ready to wait."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here.  Good food,  good service.  We have tried many menu items, never has a bad experience here.  We usually go later at night, but have been there art busy lunch times as well.  Always consistent service."}
{"text":"Food is awful. Taste like commissary prepared. Pass this place up."}
{"text":"This place was crowded, so we just got a drink to-go. Service was fine and prices were consistent with other Cheesecake Factories."}
{"text":"I have been to the cheesecake factory many times before and had a pretty good experience each time. However this was the ice cream on the cheesecake. We (a party of 6) arrived on the Saturday before Easter Sunday at around 6:00 and of course, it was busy. We figured that and were told it would be about a 40 minute wait. Fine and dandy we got a buzzer and waited outside. 40 minutes comes and goes and we haven't been called. After about 50-60 minutes I went inside and asked where we were in line and was told we were the next \"smallest large party to be seated,\" whatever that means. I went outside and we waited another 5-10 minutes and still nothing. Finally we all went inside and stool in front of the waiters podium and asked what was going on. 
Now, you have to understand that we had a young woman in our party who had been a severe car accident only a few months ago and had broken both ankles. She was able to walk, albite shakily and slowly. So she's hurting, we are all hungry, and we have all been waiting for about 1.25 hours. 
We finally get seated, after watching several other parties as large or larger than ours get seated. Our waitress was very friendly and brought us our drinks and took our orders very quickly. However we did not see her again. There was a party seated at the table next to us who was seated, got their drinks, got a basket of bread, and we were still waiting. I spoke with the manager on duty that night and he sent 3 other waiters & waitress to help us. Still, our waitress did finally show up again... And kept throwing dirty looks at us. Eventually we received our food. Some of our orders were cold. The only consolation was afterwards we bought cheesecake and it was delicious. 
The Cheesecake Factory has been satisfactory. But I will not be recommending this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but my food was at room temperature. My plate was hotter than my steak 
We would only eat there again if we had a gift certificate. Hostess sat us right next to a four top with kids, and there were 10 other tables that were more private. My wife had to ask for a more exclusive table."}
{"text":"We were there for lunch.  The overall experience is the same as the US locations, which is what you want.  Firstly, CF needs to update their decor - this place looks right out of 1995 with faux paint finished ceilings, dark wood and beige marble.  Its time for something new, fresh, brighter and lighter and they should have started with this location, which after all is a new-build.  Its strangely set up with the host desk by the outside entry doors and not one at the mall entrance.  This forces people to traipse through the restaurant to the middle, not ideal.  The wall beside our booth was greasy and food-covered.  You could see where they had tried to wipe it down -unsuccessfully - as it had an even film of gucky grease all over it - but probably didn't use anything but a damp cloth - you need glass cleaner, folks!
We were seated right away and our orders were taken without much wait.  The service was all over the place, well-intentioned and friendly, but lack of experience was evident.  I had to ask three times for cream for my coffee (why didn't they just bring it with the coffee?), my husband waited a ridiculous amount of time for his milkshake, but the barman actually came to the table to apologize - he was very sweet and funny so you just have to say \"oh well, not the end of the world\".  
We had a hamburger - it was very good but they cheap out on the fries, I had two appetizers which were very good, and a banana cheesecake also very good.  The bad was my cappucino was basically cold, and overall, the prices are quite high.  $15 for about a cup of spinach dip is crazy.
Overall, we did enjoy the experience but I think we would have had better food, better service (definitely) and more bang for our buck with a lunch at the Keg.  I would come here again, but only for cheesecake and a coffee.   This is a place where you go maybe once a year."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is a really great restaurant if you have more then 40 dollars in your wallet the food might be pricy but it's worth it if you ever go there I recommend that you try the orange chicken it tastes really good"}
{"text":"horrible service.  it is a Thursday afternoon before dinner rush we got sat. no one came to greet us at our table. we went to the host stand to ask if we could have a waiter. the waiter finally came and said I don't know why they sat you here if we don't have a server in this section. she blamed it on everyone one else. then it took forever to get waters n a drink. then we ordered food. we waited about 35 min for our waiter to come to us and say what did you guys order again. it's not in my computer... so she takes our order again and we wait another 20 min. let me tell u the restaurant was not that busy. we got our food n it was horrible. we always get the same thing so we know what to expect.  won't be back."}
{"text":"we like to go for the large portions (we like next day leftovers), ambiance, and of course cheesecake. service is usually good. staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We went last Friday the 14th of July,  another Cheesecake Factory,  another bad experience.  To start off with the Hostess was rude, and instead of waiting an hour,  we waited 1 hour 45 minutes to be seated. So we get upstairs, we have to wait another 5 min to be seated. We sit down and it takes the unhappy, uncaring, feminine waiter, about 10 minutes to acknowledge us, and another 10 minutes to bring our drinks, no alcohol, just water and soda. I was looking at the other waiter and he was fast with his customers.  We order our food...

45 minutes later they bring everyone their food,  15 minutes later they bring my chicken wings and cold fries.  During the long wait,  I filled up on delicious bread, that was the only good thing.   My aunt and uncle had cold, hard, white rice with their meal. The manager said he would give us all free cheesecake for our bad experience, wrong! Only 2 of us got it,  and my cheesecake tasted dry, and the whip cream on top was hard! 

Never again, Austin and Las Vegas Cheesecake Factory just isn't good!"}
{"text":"I definitely was disappointed the last two times I have been here. The cheesecake slices get smaller at night...shoot almost nonexistent. You wait forever for a table and then another log wait for you waiter and your food. The drinks are not worth the price you pay!!! Eh, next time I will just save my money and time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Was visiting town and my most trusted chain is Cheesecake Factory. The wait for the for was a bit long but it was worth it. The service is phenomenal and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Tex mex egg rolls were great. Crispy chicken sliders were really good. Road house sliders were disappointing. Bun with a tiny burger. No sauce. No onion. Nothing. Had to ask for condiments to eat it.  Server was pretty good"}
{"text":"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory many times and many locations, but I noticed I've never reviewed it! I'm in Cleveland on business and went with a few coworkers so thought I'd do my review now. My experience at this location was great. It was the first time I've never had a wait once I came in,(not sure if that's a good or bad thing lol). I ordered the fried zucchini, the chicken Alfredo with sun-dried tomatoes and 2 cheesecake slices to go! The white chocolate raspberry and the red velvet cheesecake. (I definitely preferred the white chocolate!) the zucchini was wonderful! Not overly breaded or dry on the inside! Also, although I got a pretty usual past, the sun-dried tomatoes gave it the kick it needed with that delicious sauce! (I specifically asked for them). *pat on the back* I always enjoy this restaurant, it is pricey but well worth it! Plus, I allllways have leftovers :)"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here.  I will say I do like it.  The first time was good.  I had Shepard's pie and really liked it.  This trip I had the skinny menu.  I ordered the salmon with veggies.  It was really good.  I liked the carrots that came with the dish.  I was craving something sweet and guess what I was at a cheese cake factory.  I had a cheese cake.  I love Nutella and had the cheese cake with nutella.  The nutella cheese cake was like the feeling of getting a muscle to release when I am doing yoga.  It was awesome and great at the same time.  Remember too.  Food is subjective and just because I like it does not mean you will.  I will try their raspberry cheese cake next time.  

This place has a huge menu.  They list the calories too.   Is that good or bad, well that depends on you.  They do offer a skinny menu too.  I like this place and will go back to try another item on their skinny menu.  I was thinking about their steak medallions with mushrooms."}
{"text":"Wow what an improvement this place has made with the service issues since the last time I was here over a year ago and previous visits before that.

Dinner hour was pretty busy but I didnt get handed a beeper and wait like always. This time I was able to walk up and hostess seated us right away. 
 
Like I said the place was pretty slammed, but there was never a lag in wait time, and servers never doubted themselves, something that I had a problem with on previous visits. This time our server and the runners did a great job with taking our orders, getting our drinks, food and desserts to our table in a timely manner. We were always checked on, our drinks filled. Staff was attentive, everyone was friendly. No one seemed stressed out. 

Only minor issue I had was when it got dark outside, the ambient lighting in the restaurant was too low.  We were cracking up because I was not the only table using their cell phone light to read the menu.

The SkinnyLicious menu was new to me and I'm lovin it!  A lot of the items are low carb or low cal most under 500 calories. I would so order their Kale Salad and the Flatbread with Pear, Blue Cheese and Arugula again. Flavors tasted really fresh and it is noted on the menu they hand make these items to order.  Hard to imagine that healthier choices can taste so good and be low enough that I can have a slice of the delish Kahlua Cocoa cheesecake (better than the Tiramisu!)  and not feel to guilty having it since Im still under my calorie intake for the day. Sweet I can have my cheesecake and eat it too! 

On the other hand the burrito and the chicken dish that were also ordered in our party didn't live up to the prices they charge for this (13.95 and 16.95) ..it looked and tasted blah. 

With a very pleasant dining experience I had tonight, I wont be hesitant now coming here for lunch or dinner. Stars for improved service, healthier choices on menu and star rating for the killer dessert!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory to us is always consistent.  Anywhere we travel we know what to expect and the Toronto location stays true to that.  The wait times are long and their estimated time they give you usually is at the higher end of the wait time if not a little longer.  The chicken bellagio was very nice with the pasta and fresh arugula and prosciutto.  Louisiana chicken pasta is always a go to for us and it's great with a bit of spice.  Wait staff are very good.  Space is tight with a stroller we had to fold it up."}
{"text":"Love the food.   Service is another issue.   Work in the area so used to eat there 2-3 times a week.  Since I usually eat with coworker, anywhere from 2,3 or 4:00...at the bar.  Most times service is reasonable, bartender always attentive.  However if 2 females sit at a high top in the bar area....good luck!  If you're a female eating alone....you better BRING your lunch!! Guys and couples ALWAYS get served first...even when they arrive after us! Their orders taken promptly, bread, drinks come right away ..and food is served usually in 15 min.  We are good tippers...and quick to order since we have an hour.   However when it now takes 35-45 minutes to get food, even when bar area is not busy, we don't have time to eat.....Too expensive to have to inhale the food and not enjoy a bite.  This never happens when a male coworker joins us....go figure!!  4 Stars for food/1 Star for Service"}
{"text":"I've been to Cheesecake Factory before and had a terrible experience. I remember my food tasting horrible... But that was probably 3 years ago. Tonight, I decided to give it another try. The food was delicious and our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We eat pretty healthy, so at first glance of the menu, we tried to justify how hard we worked out today, haha! But we ended up finding a few healthier options on their new \"skinnylicious\" menu. My one concern was they don't offer a whole wheat pasta. Why?? They offer so much gluten free, but nothing whole wheat. :("}
{"text":"Normally I don't review chain eateries but I'm feeling inspired after tonight's takeaway dinner.

It's all too easy for National chains to slip into mediocrity (my fave eatery phrase). Many start with ideals of quality, sourcing, and customer care, and get shoddy over the years. Not so for the Cheesecake Factory. Year after year, ingredient quality, service and food prep stay at a superb level.

Tonight: Sheila's chicken and avocado salad. The greens were super-fresh and included chicory, arugula, and baby spinach. Crispy won-tons (I removed mine), cashews, moist breast slices, perfectly ripe avo's, and a few other items rounded things off. As a carb-conscious diner with a healthy appetite, this dish was most satisfying.

In the past, I've also enjoyed the Asian chicken salad, grilled salmon with mashed (ok, it was a carb-splurge day ;) and 3-4 other dishes I can't recall.

Their managers are even gracious if there's ever an issue.

My \"only\" humorous-complaint is their menu listing several pages of \"specialties\". If everything is \"special\", then nothing is. But this is a trivial thing. Their food rocks!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a good meal the lemon aide is to die for great away a good time there we buy gift cards up to 200.00 worth cheese cake what can I say great deserts"}
{"text":"i've always really liked The Cheesecake Factory. my favorite menu item (Thai Chicken Past) was removed a few years ago so that made me sad. 
the funny thing for me was that i love cheesecake but never even tried their cheesecake until last year. i'm not very adventurous and just get the strawberry cheesecake which suits me fine.
our previous visit to the factory i tried the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. it was great. delicious proteins and the sauce was incredible with a touch of spice. 
last night i had the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combo. I was worried i'd ordered too much and wouldn't be able to finish it, but it was a pretty decent sized meal and i was able to scarf it all down. the sauces both were a mushroom wine sauce. delicious. the chicken came with asparagus which was cooked perfectly. the chicken itself was weirdly tender (very soft) but the taste was perfect. delicious. the steak was cooked just the way i asked but was a little on the salty side. nothing terrible and perfectly edible but that'd be my biggest complaint. 
Danielle had Salmon w/ mashed potatoes and broccoli. her broccoli was almost raw and wasn't seasoned at all. this was disappointing to her (and would have been to me also). she also said her mashed potatoes tasted too salty. her fish, though, was very good according to her. 
this visit was a nice night out with friends so all in all, a good time. 
i don't know when we'll be back again. it's kinda pricey for a chain style restaurant and the wait times are ridiculous (we tried to reserve a table since we knew we had a larger than normal party, but were told they stop taking reservations after 2pm on Saturdays. why?). we're also not too keen on the seating which usually has you sitting about 3 inches from the next table. it'd be nice to have some privacy or elbow room. heaven forbid you have to get up to use the restroom. your rear end would probably graze the plates of the tables next to you."}
{"text":"Just plain bs that this is the quality piece of cake you get for 8.00. The size is inconsistent it's absolutely crazy to me. 
I understand it can be busy at times however I'd rather wait a few more minutes to get a better cut piece. When the employee was asked why it was so small she said that's just how it is and shrugged her shoulders. Will not be back.

Not to mention the piece was half frozen. If I wanted something frozen I would have gone to the grocery store. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Dropped in  for a quick lunch, wasn't  surprised with the long lines and 45 minute wait. The strawberry lemonade and entree was well worth the wait. We took   two slices of their cheesecake and my taste buds desired more.  Most definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is always one of our go to places to eat. Always great quality and friendly staff.
Love love the Baja Chicken Tacos, Cajun jumbolia, sweet tamale corn cakes, and stuffed chicken tortillas to name a few!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for happy hour and was really surprised.  Great hh menu and prices. Giovanni, our server, was excellent and very attentive.  He looked out for me with my second drink order which he got in before hh ended (M-F 4-6). If your like for good food, atmosphere and service this is the place to go.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to this Cheesecake Factory for 12 years. This is the only Cheesecake Factory we will go to in AZ. Great service, food is always on point, prices are ok (but understood), drinks are a little pricey, service is great and always a good environment."}
{"text":"The menu here is like a JC Penney catalog. It has so many options on it that I always have a hard time deciding what to order. Even though this place is big and offers plenty of seating inside and outdoors, it is always packed. Parking can be a pain but I have never had to wait that long for a table. Our server (name escapes me sorry dude) was always checking on us and friendly. 

Started out with Stuffed Mushrooms. I have had these with clam or sausage before...but these had a blend of cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We got 6 with the order and they did not last long. I used some of the bread that was brought to the table to soak up the last bit of the wine sauce. 

For dinner I had a Macaroni & Cheese Burger. This was a risky choice...I knew I would either love it or hate it. The burger had fried macaroni balls and cheese sauce on it. I asked them to leave the veggies off my burger this time because I did not know if fried mac & cheese and tomatoes, onion or lettuce go good together or not. The burger was very cheesy and I enjoyed it. The fries it came with were hot and good. The side of ranch I requested was nasty though. It does not even taste like ranch but something bitter and gross and the color was more clear than white. My wife had half of a chicken salad sandwich and cup of tortilla soup. She enjoyed her sandwich and loved the soup but didn't like her salad due to the same nasty ranch being on it. I had half of her soup and liked it as well. We both left fulfilled and happy and had no room for cheesecake."}
{"text":"Not the best service that I've had a a cheesecake factory. We sat at the bar and no bread or food for 30 minutes. I still waiting for good service"}
{"text":"Great food. Great people. Open late. And they have happy hours and deals on certain things. Foods of all kind. And they change the menu a lot. So you can always find something new to try. Definetly a place for dinner parties and families. They also have a show right in front for the tourists since we r in Las Vegas Baby!!!!"}
{"text":"If you have a spare four hours, have lots of patience, and don't mind spending a lot of money for average food, this might be your go to chain restaurant.

We wanted to make a reservation for Thursday night (1-14-16), for ten. We were told that company policy didn't allow reservations, even for large groups. My wife asked how long it would likely take if we showed up at 6:00. She estimated 45 minutes.

My daughter arrived at 6:00 and put in a reservation for ten and was told it would be around 7:15. (75 minutes rather then 45). No big deal. We go to the bar and 7:30 rolls around. I wander through the restaurant and notice that they are severely limited on large tables and that none of the large tables are close to being done. We talk to the manager and he estimates it will be another 5 minutes. What did the manager see that I didn't? A little bit before 8 we get buzzed, get our group together including an elderly person with a walker, and are informed that the table is not ready but that he wants to give us an update. He puts the blame on customers who are taking too long to leave (we later learn it is really due to really slow service). The manager orders us two complimentary appetizers at the bar where we have already spent over $150. A single crown royal on the rocks runs $10, and the menu includes no prices for drinks. We finally getter seated at 8:15. This is an hour after we were told the table would be ready and two hours and fifteen minutes after we arrived.

This better be good. Our waitress was pleasant and expressed an understanding of our long wait but then proceeded to do nothing to make up for the poor service. Honestly, I have never seen a restaurant do a worse job of turning tables. There was almost always 5-6 tables that were not cleared, or were empty. The manager told me he was aware of this issue.

Our orders didn't get taken until 8:30,  and our food didn't arrive until 9:00. I ordered the steak tacos. The black beans were stone cold, the rice and tacos were barely warm. At this point I had talked to the manager twice and was simply starving. I should have sent it back but didn't. The cheesecake we ordered was average at best and took for ever to arrive. My son ordered a slice that they were out of. Long story short? We got out of there at nearly 10:00. It's not the customers that are causing tables to be occupied for 90 minutes. I thought maybe something besides the two appetizers would be comped. They were not. No apology from anyone when we left. Our food bill and tip was over $270 plus a bar tab of over $150. So....we spent about $42 a person for a four hour miserable experience. Any restaurant that knew what they were doing, would have given us a small gift card to give them a second chance on a better night. 

It amazes me that this place is this busy. I have been to the Chesecake factory in in Chicago and don't recall these problems. I suspect that after the novelty wears off, that people will go to the many other restaurants in Dane County. While waiting for our table, I shared my observations with the manager and asked him if he had read any of the negative reviews on-line. He said that he had and that corporate was also well aware of the problems. You will notice that management doesn't appear to respond to any reviews on-line. More importantly, they do nothing to correct the problems. We were celebrating three birthdays, but what we will remember is the service that sucked at the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times in the past. Have always been happy with the food quality and the service (try the Memphis Burger!). If you go in the winter, the busy season, be prepared to walk a LONG distance, parking in this plaza BLOWS."}
{"text":"One thing to rely on when visiting chains, food tastes the same. Always get my usual and a nice cheesecake to finish. What makes this one any different? Customer service! He was very patient with my kiddos. Even after a spill, he was still all smiles and very attentive to our requests. Menu choices: chicken madeira, crusted chicken Romano, pasta carbonara, pumpkin swirl cheesecake. All great!!"}
{"text":"Make sure when you put your name down you literally stand by the hostess stand. If you stand by the fish tank they will skip over you. We were told it was a 15 min wait, we waited 30 mins and then we're told they already called us. After waiting about 45 mins, we finally were seated. The reason they are getting 4 stars is because our waitress Tina was incredible! She was so personable and after a horrible experience with the hostess stand, she really was able to turn our moods around. If we come back we will definitely be requesting her."}
{"text":"Came down to enjoy Cheesecake Factory mainly because of the Avacado Eggrolls  I originally walked up to the bar because I'm aware there's no wait. I tried to sit with the bartender and he just was closed off and no personality and had attitude when I asked if there was an amount on the gift cards I had. So I walked away from the bar to grab a table. 
I got sat and I was restarting my meal. My waitress was Nicole and she was so so sweet. She advised me her honest opinions on one of these features drinks and I was not let down. I ordered the eggrolls unsure if I wanted a meal. I ordered the sausage and shrimp pasta which was good; however a little heavy creamy wise on the sauce. She delightfully packed me up my red velvet cheesecake and I was on my way. 
Thanks girl and thanks CKF."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorites but it seems they have made some changes. The tiramisu which used to be the best I have had outside italy, was all sugar. It even had a strange texture that was sugary. The strawberry lemonade was extremely bitter. They took off the menu the honey vanilla latte. I will have to find new desserts and drinks to try here. The food was great as usual. Just very dissappointed in the dessert."}
{"text":"Love Cheesecake Factory food but a 2 hour wait on the weekend is too much!"}
{"text":"I had to write a review about this place because I just read Will F.'s review.  My fave dish is the Chicken Picatta, too... yum!!!!!  My second favorite would have to be the Cajun Chicken Littles... and that is a very, very close second!  I love all the dipping sauces-- especially their ranch!  You have to ask for it because it doesn't come with the dish.  This location is always super busy...but probably not as busy as the Caesar's one. My favorite cheesecakes are, in no special order: original, white chocolate raspberry, banana cream, and cookie dough.  My favorite non-cheesecake dessert there is definitely Linda's Chocolate Cake.  It is super moist and chocolatey!!  Also love their strawberry lemonade!!"}
{"text":"I organized a \"post-holiday\" party for a group of my co-workers at the Cheesecake Factory. I had called to asked about reservations for a Sunday night at 6 PM. Unfortunately they weren't able to take reservations but said that during the afternoon, a wait time for a party of 10 was an hour and a half. I went down an hour early to put our name in and a manager came to tell me the wait time was an hour and a half still. Luckily for us the wait was only an hour and we were able to seat at 6 PM! While we waited, my friend and I sat at the bar and had drinks. I had a frozen passion fruit margarita and April had a peach Bellini. I wasn't a fan of my drink, but I liked April's! For dinner, I had the barbecue ranch chicken salad and chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. Both delicious! The gathering was a success and I appreciated the friendly hostesses, general manager and waitress that we had during our dinner!"}
{"text":"Nothing worth coming for other than cheesecake. If you're here for the food, don't bother. We ordered the honey truffle chicken - overall pretty below average. Expected more for the price. Nothing special and definitely lacked flavour. We asked for gravy, which made it slightly better. Also ordered the shrimp with angel hair (as per recommended by our server). Unfortunately the shrimp were not fresh, it was mushy and disgusting. The manager tried it, agreed and was apologetic so we didn't mind too much. We had requested to change our dish to the bistro shrimp pasta - this one was better. The shrimp was overly battered though, making it way too bready. Pasta itself was average. 
Would I be back to dine in? No. Takeout for cheesecake? Yes. Their caramel cheesecake, 30th anniversary cheesecake, and the blackout cake are my favourites. Their cakes are always consistent in flavour and just delicious."}
{"text":"Service is depending on how busy they are. They are pretty attentive though. Food always tastes fresh and servers are all friendly!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was good, service was a little slow as it was busy. A portion of my  meal was cold. The saving grace is that I have been here before and everything was great."}
{"text":"This is gonna be a short review. I can't think of any reason to recommend you eat here. Sure, it's hard to believe that a restaurant with the word cheesecake in its name could in any way disappoint. But believe it. 

This restaurant boasts of having 200 dishes on its menu. Points for variety? Nope, what this says to me is that instead of making a handful of dishes really well, they endeavor to make 200 mediocre ones. I've eaten here twice and sampled the entrees of my table-mates, so I'd say I've tried about 8 dishes. All were mediocre - neither great nor shitty. Think: the approximate quality of any decent hospital cafeteria food. At 3 times the cost. The desserts rank a bit better on the taste scale but not by much. The decor is gawd-awful."}
{"text":"Trying some fried avacado to die for!  Along with fried mozzarella, zucchini and eggplant!  Amazing!  Lightly  coated with flour, crispy on the outside and light and succulent on the inside!  Also had a Tomato, Mozzarella & Basil  Toast .  In a well done crisp flatbread with Greek yogurt as a spread with luscious toppings as stated above.  Our waiter was great!  Timely service.  Topped it off with a Chocolate Diva Cheesecake that I shared!!!   Amazing experience.  Moderate to high prices but has great lunch specials from 11-5 starting at $11 dollars!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really slow and unprofessional service can be overshadowed by exceptional food, but this place has bad food too."}
{"text":"We always have a good meal here and it gives you what you'd expect from this chain.  It's in a great location in Westlake to boot."}
{"text":"the food is consistent just like all the other Cheesecake Factory.  We had a late start so we had brunch.  I ordered the Mini Egg Breakfast $9 and fresh Orange Juice.  The food was good and the orange juice was full of pulp I had 2 glasses."}
{"text":"Came initially on opening day but there was a 3 hr wait to be seated, so the wife and I returned on day 2 (much earlier this time) and only waited 1 hr. The restaurant itself is almost identical to all other Cheesecake Factories we've seen from east coast to west coast in our travels throughout the states, which is definitely a plus. 

On to the food: my wife ordered her regular angel hair shrimp pasta in marinara sauce, which they were able to sub in fettuccini no problem, and I had the factory burrito grande. I can't complain about the burrito, it tasted decent and the chicken was seasoned nicely. The shrimp pasta, on the other hand, was dry and very bland. Our waiter gladly took it back to the kitchen for us and had them remake it. Unfortunately, the kitchens idea of correcting a bland marinara pasta was to add a mountain of diced tomatoes, which only helped make the pasta more sour and much less palatable. Manager came out to see us afterwards to see if he could change out my wife's dish, but at that point we had spent the last 2.5 hrs at factory and I was more than halfway through my meal, so we just wanted to get to dessert already. We opted to order dessert to go as we were becoming anxious from sitting at our table so long. This wasn't an easy process either, however. Our waiter took our cheesecake orders (7 in total), but messed up on so many things I care not to elaborate here. Let's just say the cheesecake order took another hour itself. Got all of them in front of me now, but can't comment on taste until we get home, hopefully all is good. 

On to the service: our waiter was quite personable and prompt, and I'm assuming under supervision still as another waiter continuously observed him in action. He was quite attentive to our concerns and prompt at addressing that which needed to be addressed. The manager also appeared rather concerned about out unsatisfying experience so far, and after implying it to him, he offered to \"take the pasta off the bill\", a gesture that normally would be offered without prompting. 

Overall, I was somewhat underwhelmed by the opening. The experience was very different from what we've come to expect from Cheesecake Factory. In all fairness, I understand that this is the first restaurant to open in Canada, and these growing pains are to be expected. I would most definitely try returning again in the future, albeit not for at least a few months. Hopefully by then the Factory will be functioning like a well oiled machine.

Recommendation: not worth a 3 hr wait, but definitely give it a shot if it's not so busy."}
{"text":"2nd time at this place. The food and service as awesome as the last time I was here. I ordered the chicken Bellagio and It was amazing. Calamari was great as well.. Luv it!!
Last visit I ordered the chicken Madeira.  It was soooo goood.."}
{"text":"I came to this location to stop and grab a large cheesecake. While I was there I was not dressed in what a waitress considered to be appropriate for the restaurant. This waitress proceeded to tell me that. Mind you I was wearing a t-shirt and a pair of shorts. I did not know there was a dress code that said I couldn't be in shorts and a t-shirt. This is very disappointing that a waitress stated this and did not say it in a nice manner but in a disgusted tone. Sorry Cheesecake Factory you should have more polite waitresses."}
{"text":"By far the worst service I have ever received at a Cheesecake Factory. The wait staff rushed us and the kitchen staff was loud and very rude. We ended up leaving .  I contacted the chain but they had no interest in speaking with me."}
{"text":"We have eaten here on several occasions and have always loved it.
The food and service are awesome. 
All of the portions are quite large and always good.  The desserts are
extremely good.
The menu is quite varied and there is something for everyone; this is our first choice to take company out for dinner."}
{"text":"I only come here on special occasions. And for dessert, never fails, we always get the Strawberry shortcake"}
{"text":"We've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times since living in Scottsdale and sadly will not be returning. Tonight we decided to eat here for my daughter's birthday and we all left extremely disappointed. 

Our waitress started off not wanting to be at work and very short with her words. She then reminded us several times that she has been working all day and very tired. 

For drinks, my husband and I ordered coffees only to have my husband's coffee come to the table full of grounds, not a little bit of grounds, but a lot! We asked for a different cup and simply never got one. 

When my husband's starter salad came out he ate half of it only to find a very large dark hair in it. He stopped eating it and we told the waitress. The manager then came out and apologized and offered another salad. Which we turned down. 

When our daughter's kids meal (spaghetti) came out it had a large black \"thing\" in it, which we noticed right away. So the waitress took the plate away and simply never came back with our daughter's food. 

After an hour at the table, our daughters ended up eating my husband's food since the spaghetti plate was never returned. 

The waitress apologized for all the troubles and said \"they\" would make it right. We were unsure what that meant so we didn't specifically ask how. 

When we got the bill, \"they\" took off our daughter's spaghetti kids meal (but JUST the spaghetti as we still had to pay for her kids drink) and mind-you she never even got her meal back to actually eat.

My husband left hungry and thirsty and the whole family upset about the experience. 

We honestly are the type of people who would come back as mistakes do happened. But this time we felt no one really cared about all the mistakes. Especially our waitress, who acting like she was just simply \"too tired\". 

No more birthday meals here that's for sure. :("}
{"text":"Another over-hyped location. I have no idea how this is possible, but I don't really like their desserts. I keep trying new things and every time I'm like \"I paid 9 bucks for this?\" They try, and things always look fancy. I must be broken.

As for the place, its huge! And they have you sit shoulder to shoulder with another couple which I hate. If you ask for a booth, expect to wait... there was always a wait. The layout is really clustered and uncomfortable. The waitstaff always seems overworked and forgetful. 

I have tried quite a bit of the menu and only like one thing... White Romano. Its an Alfredo remake of their chicken and spaghetti dish and its pretty great. Try it."}
{"text":"We had a really nice, quiet dinner after a night out with friends. It was around 1130/12. Our server was Jessica, super sweet. 
When leaving we were really thrown off at the new lounge next door, \"the mixx\".  It was super loud, tons of people outside yelling and singing. Not a good look for boca park."}
{"text":"Spoiler Alert!!! I didn't have cheesecake! I know! I know! 

I used to love Cheesecake Factory. I mean I would find any excuse to go here...but after a while things changed, the food was different and I stopped going. And then my friends came to visit from Virginia and where did they wanna go????  Our good old standby...of course! 

And here we go:

Drinks: 
My favorite for a long time has been their Georgia Peach. Vodka, Peach liquor swirled with raspberries and topped with a mint leaf so it looks like a peach in a glass. Perfect! Always delicious, and most certainly expect to order two! Mmmmmm! 

Appetizers:
We ordered the wings without the sauce. They were okay. A little dry but we just doused them in blue cheese and ranch. There are plenty of other options so unless you're craving wings try something else. We also ordered the Buffalo Blasts. Now these things are freaking delicious! It's chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce stuffed in a wonton and fried. You can always sign me up for anything with the words \"fried, chicken and cheese\" in the description. They were ahhhhmazing! Crispy on the outside juicy flavorful meat stuffed on the inside (and they are not stingy with the filling) served hot with ranch dressing...like Nike says Just Do It! You can thank me later! 

Dinner: 
I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon. It comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus over a lemon sauce. I'm a huge fan of the lemon sauce (always ask for extra) but last night the salmon just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, portion size was not the issue. But it was just very bland. The potatoes are chunky with pieces of the red skin, not a favorite for me but that's just my personal preference. The asparagus was cooked perfectly and dipped in the lemon sauce....simply divine! 

Overall, the meal was just okay. Nowhere near as good as I used to remember but not bad by any means. I'm sure I'll be back...and yes I'll make sure to get a piece of cheesecake."}
{"text":"Nice place, friendly service, but \"meh\" just about describes the food experience. My friend had a pasta dish that should have had \"with shrimp\" in teeny tiny letters as those were in short supply. I had about the simplest thing on the menu--the Regina Special, with soup (good), salad (okay), and a mayonnaise sandwich, aka chicken salad with almonds. In this case, the chicken should have been in teeny tiny letters and the almonds must have been disguised as mayonnaise, and a very good disguise it was. Yuk! No crunch, no color, no like. Be ashamed, Cheesecake Factory. Be very ashamed."}
{"text":"I came here to try the celebration cheesecake! I've had my eye on it for a while and it exceeded my expectations and beyond! The cheesecake tasted like ice cream that never melted. I hope this cheesecake stays on the menu and will be back for more."}
{"text":"5 stars for their Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake!
3 stars for the Service from last visit.

I only find myself coming here to the cheesecake factory for mainly three things cheesecake, the Thai Lettuce Wraps on the appetizers menu and the Miso Glazed Salmon dish. Every time I come here, I try a dish that I haven't had here before and always leave disappointed. 

When you order the lettuce wraps, on the plate comes ice burg lettuce cups, three different sauces, chicken, and veggies and you build your own wrap. Its good and enjoyable to make yourself. Plus not everyone likes the same sauces and whatnot so they have the choice of what they want. 

The Miso Glazed Salmon is served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of cooked asparagus. The perfect combination if you ask me, and if you are there at lunch time you have the option of ordering the 1/2 order since the dinner size is really big. But my recent order was the taco salad. it wasn't anything special but shredded lettuce, strips of seasoned tortilla chips tomatoes and avocado tossed in a mayo chipotle dressing and served as three heaping HILLS on your plate. Really? I paid $13 for this dish, something i could've made at home...was disappointed to say the least.

I have tried a variety of their cheesecakes and the newest to my top list is the Pineapple upside down cake. The pineapple and crust is at the bottom and the cream cheese itself has a pineapple's flavor to it. Not so sweet, but just a perfect blend so you can enjoy it rather than having to take a sip of water between every bite. 

The service from a recent visit i have gone was lacking. We were there in a group of four at most, yet have been seated after bigger groups whom arrived AFTER us has been seated. When i questioned the hostess  about it, she simply stated its easier to group the couples and bigger groups first when the room becomes available what are we??? Aside from that, it almost seemed as if the other waiters are more useful and punctual than our own waiter. we had to flag down a waiter from another table because the person waiting us can't be found. This was the first time that I have experienced such bad service. BUT, the service is usually really good and waiters are on their game.

Overall, the atmosphere is nice and busy, friendly and you can enjoy your meal either outside or inside-they give you the option. The price is nothing to complain about since the servings are big enough, and the food isn't lacking in flavor. But sometimes, you wonder what is so special about that pasta dish that they can charge $15 for...."}
{"text":"First time experience. Tried turkey burger from the skinyalicous menu. Burger was ok but greasy. They served me a salad that has gone bad.  You donot serve a salad with rotting vegetables. Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad. 
Service was good. Only saving grace."}
{"text":"Ate here twice this weekend. Both times for lunch/brunch. I tried the chicken and waffles for the first time.  The waffles were a bit soggy and the hollandaise sauce was not very tasty. This was surprising considering the menu is usually on point. Fortunately, husband enjoyed the brulee French toast."}
{"text":"Can't complain ... great service, great cheesecake, decent food."}
{"text":"Ok..so this is a chain but thought I would check in anyway.
My other half and I wanted to catch Cinderella on the screen nearby and thought we'd grab a bite here.
The wait wasn't bad..I ordered the veggie burger and fries and the Hubs chose a burger also
 10 mins. Later was told the veggie burger was sold out..darn! So I went with the garlic pasta because it sounded delicious and the Hubs changed his mind to shrimp. .I love garlic!.. Mind you I was quite famished by the time it came.. I dug in and boy was I quite disappointed to find they are merely butter noodles no garlic or garlic flavor at all..bummer :(
The shrimp asked I'm told was oj.
Maybe I wanted to be blown away by garlic..but alas was not. 
I did eat what I ordered because I was hungry.  Did I let them know?  Yes but since it was busy and it took time to get the waiter back.
The manager came by. He took care of it and we were happy.
We will be back."}

{"text":"I love this place no matter which one I'm at. I visited this location last night and had the pleasure of sitting at the bar and the bartender was amazing. Geoff was very attentive and personable. He really made our stay here that much better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I go back and forth with Cheesecake Factory. It's a love/hate relationship. My brother wanted to come here for his birthday, so we came. I usually get the deep fried mac n cheese balls (an app but I get it as an entree), but I saw they had it on a burger so I went with that instead. It was OK, but I would have rather gone to Red Robin. The caesar I got was disgusting. No flavor whatsoever. My  husband got the club which is HUGE and my brother got the three cheese pasta - they both liked their meals. 

You have to try the deep fried mac n cheese balls - they are what keep me coming back. The strawberry lemonade is delicious, but SO sweet. In fact I had just the regular lemonade this time and it was super sweet too. Pretty quick service and we were seated in less than 15 minutes even on Friday night.

Their Sunday brunch is delicious - lots of yummy options and you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Came to Cheesecake Factory as we were making a trip to Yorkdale. We arrived early, before the restaurant opened but there was a pretty big lineup already. We waited about 15 minutes before being seated. The menu was plentiful but unfortunately, one of the dishes I chose to order was not available that day. I settled for the breakfast plate - eggs, pancakes, and bacon. The portion was good, but nothing special. However, my fiancé ordered the chicken and waffles - it was delicious! Portion was great!

We left satisfied with our meal. And ordered 2 cheese cake slices to go. They were delicious, although a bit pricey for the portion you get.

Our waiter, Darren was amazing. Great service from him."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were at Caesar and having lunch in the Cheesecake Factory. Raul is serving our table and he is the BEST!!!!! He is super friendly and checking on us often. He is the star!!!!"}
{"text":"Caved to my kids' nagging and went to Cheesecake in Yorkdale. We were a party of 5 and sat in a booth meant for 6. If your party is larger than 6 you will likely have a much, much longer wait because I don't think they have many booths for larger parties, and you would be waiting till empty tables open up near each other.  I suspect this gets easier once winter break is over.

The wait: Went on a Friday. We arrived to the line shortly after 2pm. By 2:30 we had our pager and meandered around the mall until 4pm, when we were instructed to return to the \"pager-operational\" zone. By 4:20 we were seated. I found the process to be fairly efficient.  They do not accept reservations.

While we didn't have a stroller with us, we noticed a \"stroller parking\" zone, as bringing them to the table is not possible (limited space).  We had two servers during our meal: Leonard (who then went on break) and another gentleman (whose name I forgot).  Both were friendly. 

We had been to many Cheesecakes in the US, so we knew what to expect of the menu and décor (and the fact that WiFi is not available in the restaurant). We did not feel rushed during our meal.

Food: We ordered a platter of Factory Nachos (a few of us didn't love the cheese on it and I would have liked a bit more sour cream). What was nice was that the cheese was evenly melted, which isn't always the case at other restaurants. One of us ordered the steak tacos and loved them (and the rice). My mother had a classic hamburger (a basic patty), and really liked the fries and the bun. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken.  It had a good \"kick\" to it.  The sauce is a bit sticky (I actually liked it better when I re-heated at home the next day....lots of leftovers!). For the little kiddies: there is a good selection of junior meals. My daughter had initially asked for chicken samosas, but they didn't have anymore. 

Overall, it was a positive experience: good food, huge selection with something for everyone, large portions and friendly servers."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory many times, probably eaten at almost all the locations in Las Vegas. Overall, I'm very much happy with my experiences here.

This chain has one of those menus that can please any palate. It takes quite a while to even go through the whole menu, it's about 6-7 pages long. They have breakfasts, sandwiches, salads, appetizers, pastas, seafood, meat, burgers, and of course, their infamous cheesecakes.

We actually ordered salads, appetizers, and desserts to go on our last visit. I'd have to say if you do come at peak hours, they will be a wait to be seated. 

I can't name all the foods I've eaten here, there's just too many. I'd have to say most of them are good and tasty. We've tried their salads recently, and were a bit disappointed. Just lots of wilted lettuce and not enough toppings. I'm not a big fan of their cheesecake, but I think it's because I prefer the denser version. Their other desserts, the Chocolate Truffle Cake and Carrot Cake, very yummy! Actually, all their other non-cheesecake desserts are phenomenal and huge-portioned. Definitely requires sharing!

There's been good service, mediocre, and exceptional service on my visits. Overall, I'd have to say it's always decently good. Usually if it's bad, I remember it.

I have tried to steer clean of chains these days, but Cheesecake Factory will probably always stick out in my mind as a go-to place to please many people because of their food and enormous menu selections."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the whiny reviews. The menu is to0 thin? Really? It takes 10 minutes to get through it all. It's too pricey for what you get? You get enough food to make a whole second meal in leftovers!
If you give one star because you had to wait, then go across the street to Denny's where you'll be happier and probably better suited for you anyways.
All the food is really good. The prices are more than reasonable for the quantity and quality, and the cheesecake is awesome. Just a fun place.
Obviously they are working with a new staff. The wait is long because people are going there! Whiners, go someplace that is empty and enjoy that food that nobody is standing in line for. Arghhhh!"}
{"text":"OK, I'm gonna take one for the team and admit it.  Is it bad that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place?  No judging now.  

I mean, I usually reject any restaurant remotely chain-like, but Cheesecake Factory, you are one of a handful of respectable chains that I like and frequent.   

An easy solution when you don't know what you want to eat (you're sure to find something in the menu, yeah, it may take 40 minutes to decide, but whatever), or want to take Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Charlie from the Midwest somewhere fun, but not too edgy or Scottsdale-like.

Funny thing is I've had their cheesecake maybe about two times, because with the ridiculously large portions would I really have any room?  And if you're looking to totally WRECK your diet, this is your place - there's hardly anything healthy on the menu (but they did just start a lite salad menu).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders.  Grilled shrimp club, BBQ chicken pizza, blackened chicken sandwich,  chicken chipotle pasta, chicken romano, and chicken madeira are all REALLY good.  I guess I like chicken, huh?

FYI, they don't have a kids menu, which is really DUMB, because this place is such a family restaurant.

For those who care, they have Valet.  I mean, come on, really?  There is a parking structure on the other side of Macy's.  Valet in Phoenix with easy parking situation = lame."}
{"text":"So I've admitted in the Biltmore location's review that I secretly LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location stinks.  

Lunch is always busy, and service (up to now) was so-so.  But most recently my co-workers took me to lunch here for my birthday, and here is how the exchange with our 22 year old skanky server went. I swear I am not making this up.  We place our orders and then my co-workers call over our server.  Let's call the 22 year old skanky server Tammy McSleazerston.

Co-workers:  (point over at me like I'm not there, as if to request some kind of retarded ice cream, song and dance freebie) It's his birthday today, could we have some kind of something for him.
TM:  (In baby voice, and taking her index finger and pointing at her right cheek) Aww, is it your boothday tuhday Mishtuh Man??
Me:  (Stunned, and not knowing what to say)  Um yeah.
TM says she'll be back, and walks away.
Me and Co workers:  (Look at each other jaw-dropped)

We finish lunch, they give me my stupid ice cream, and we leave a crappy tip and a note to the manager to rein in his flippant servers -- and no apology, or other response."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best cheesecake I have ever had. The taste of the cream cheese in the cake is not overwhelming and it tastes just right. I had the tiramisu cake but it was still frozen so it was replaced with tiramisu cheesecake which was delicious. My boyfriend the key lime and lemon meringue cheesecake. 

We did not have a meal there as we found the prices to be on the expensive side. Sandwiches were 20$ and up. They have a brunch menu which looked decent. 

Since this place is fairly new, it is quite busy but since we went on a Sat at 11am, it was not a long wait. We waited 10 minutes. There were people in line at 9pm still trying to get in there when we were heading home from yorkdale. 

I would go there again but just to get cheesecake takeout."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Delicious food and great service! I got the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken and the Hershey's S'mores cheesecake. I highly recommend both 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Being located inside the Caesar palace expect to have a wait when you come to this location. Today around lunch time though we got seated quickly. The food here is okay. They have a large selection of food, too much to choose from. Having so many options can get dangerous haha. I ordered the miso salmon from the lunch menu. It was a good portion, just enough to get me full and leave room for dessert.

Just like the food menu there is a large selection of cheesecake and other desserts here. Today we ordered the strawberry shortcake and the new salted caramel cheesecake. Strawberry shortcake was really good but the cheesecake was a little too sweet for my tasting. I would come back here."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant when we travel as it has proven to be very consistent. Tonight we had the Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken and chicken piccata with mashed potatoes. Service is quick and food comes rather quickly. The portions are generous as well."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Only bad thing is how it was designed. They have multiple rooms unlike the other Cheesecake Factory locations this one is smaller. Food is always the same and consistent. Avocado egg rolls, bam bam chicken and chicken Madeira you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered the eggplant dinner with pesto past on the side! I was pretty excited because I've only been here one other time before I wrote Yelp reviews. The pasta was good but mostly tasted like garlic. The eggplant was great but a little to salty for my. I only dyed a little because I had to save room for the delicious peppermint cheesecake that had candy canes crushed up on top! Yum! FYI everyone on Saturday they will not validate parking because the parking is 3 dollars on Saturday.. kinda annoying that I just spent $30.00 on dinner and you won't validate my 3.00 because it's Saturday.. but you would if it was Friday. 
Had a good time with my friends overall."}
{"text":"I like the fact that they serve you a ton of food on your plate. I used to dine out here to meet aquaintences for fellowship. The menu can be pricey at times."}
{"text":"Got a chance to eat hear a week ago with some clients and I love the decor and feel of this place. It's like Little Vegas with seating for 300-400. The booths are huge, the greek paintings on the rotunda ceilings and the service is what makes this the total package. The menu is extensive, but could be overwhelming for some. I recommend starting with the fried zucchini or green beans. The chicken Madeira was excellent with the sauteed veggies, asparagus, melted cheese and comp bread and butter. Good place for birthdays, dates, or special occasions....oh yea...the cheesecake is excellent."}
{"text":"For an appetizer we had Cuban Rolls with Roast pork, ham, pickle, and cheese. My dad says they remind him of a Cuban sandwich, but it doesn't taste exactly like one. But the taste is excellent. We also had a Chicken Lettuce Wrap. Too much ginger for my taste, but my parents like it. They would rate it about 3.5/5
    I had the Bacon- Bacon cheeseburger. It was too big for me to finish. But was absolutely delicious.
    My dad had a Mexican salad. Again, it was too big to finish. But he liked it.
    My mom had a Hibachi steak. Too big to finish. And was delicious.
     My grandma had a Chicken Quesadilla.It was a nice proportion size. Very good.
    Overall,  the dinner was amazing. 3.5/5 for the dinner"}
{"text":"Normally I come here at anytime and the foods great, today on the other hand was another story..

Sat down once our waiter came he quickly took our drink orders , upon returning he asked us if we were ready which we've only been there for about a minute and 30 seconds we said we needed some time but we put in an order for the garlic bread. He then moved directly to the table next to us which he then took there order which was less then 60 seconds then returned to us to ask if we were ready. 

He rushed us yet again so we just orderd . then after he brought us the house bread which consist of the wheat bread and the white bread, except they were out of white bread so he just brought the wheat he said no apologies or anything. I figured okay not a big deal because I like the wheat. But this time it was extremely stale I mean hard as a rock , didn't eat it which again I didn't care much as its bread.

Soon which he returned with our garlic cheese bread immediately we noticed it was very burnt but we erceeded to eat some, it was soaked in oil on the inside completely rushed just terrible.

After which I just asked for the check so I could pay for the drinks and terrible bread and leave. He brought the check with the burgers still on it before we even got the burgers. I said no I would like to cancel and he said okay walked away, I waited a few minutes to still pay in which he didn't return so we just left.

He had almost a short Seth rogan haircut and glasses terrible.

The best guy is the guy with the pony tail , I once got a burrito and didn't like it and still tipped him 10 

Anyways very hesitant to go back 
Everything was completely rushed and it was only 10:30"}
{"text":"It's one of those places where you'll say 'this will do' Food is great everytime, service is touch and go.
However, Being from New Zealand I HAVE to remember that American serving sizes are insane. So make sure you have a lot of room in your stomach."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! We usually stop by for Happy hour because we like to sit at the bar. Service, food and ambience is 5 stars"}
{"text":"Here's a simple transaction gone stupidly wrong.

A man walks into a Cheesecake Factory 30-minutes to close. The place is less than half full, so it's not busy by any measure. All this man wants is to order two slices and to go home. He stands in front of the display case, as one does, waiting to ask a question and to then place an order. 

And he keeps standing there. 

There's one busy bee who's pulling all the weight filling orders as the dupes roll in. She's far too preoccupied, that is clear. Then there's the other, standing at the register, pretending to be busy. She looks at me on occasion, we make eye contact, and it's clear, I need help, and she's not busy, nor is she coming over. Maybe it's not her job? Maybe she's been scolded for leaving her register? I don't know. It's not my job to know.

I wait a few more minutes watching the hustle. One manager comes in and gives the busy bee an understanding kiss on the head. Odd. Neither here nor there, though. I eventually walk over to the one whose feet are stuck at the register. She asks if I need anything. Incredulous, I say yes, and a question, but is there a reason you didn't come over when you saw me standing there forever? 

\"I was busy.\"

No. No you weren't. And your muscles could have transported you over three feet to meet a customer. Anyway, I place my order, and there's not an ounce of hospitality in her voice or actions. No civility. Cold dismissiveness. I thank her for taking my money, but she continues to stand there. My cheesecake? No. She eyeballs the guy standing beside me, then back at me. Am I supposed to interpret this eyeballing? She then snarks at me to move, that, \"I need to take his order.\"  
\"THAT's interesting,\" I say. She has to take *his* before completing mine, after I've been standing there for ten minutes already. And how does that rule work if the line is more than two customers deep? 
Have I wronged this woman somehow, in a past life perhaps? Just unreal. It's like she was stickin' it to me. For what? For being a customer? 

While waiting for the next guy to place an infinitely long order before receiving mine, I see another manager come by. I tell HIM what just happened. He apologizes, which is nice, and he collects my cheesecake and hands it to me. Apologizes again. All that's well and good...but what are you going to do about that staffer (Sharonte, the receipt claims)? Let her look at me smugly as I leave, which she did, and let bygones be bygones? 

Bad service is bad service, happens from time to time. But this felt weirdly personal, and as if no one cared whatsoever. Looking at other negative reviews, there's an obvious pattern here, as well as the textbook response from Management. Maybe try fixing your service issues instead of endlessly apologizing for them? 
This Cheesecake is less than a mile from my house, but there's no way I'll ever return, not with that welcoming and sendoff as if I'd been punished for some unknown transgression. 

Cheesecake splurge mood: spoiled. Rotten."}
{"text":"Consistently a winner! For those of you who enjoy Cheesecake Factory, this location will satisfy your needs. The food is ALWAYS good. We've never had bad service there either. If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory, you're missing out! They have a wide variety of lunch/dinner options and of course a ton of cheesecake options. Be prepared to spend a bit of money though. Most dishes cost close to $20. It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I am mad at myself for never eating here before. My first thought is that the food is a little pricy, but once my wife and I got our meals we both agree that it is actually cheap for the amount and quality that is served. I would definitely recommend the hibachi steak with a Guinness."}
{"text":"One word: consistency! Food has same flavors as every restaurant of the chain, Lakayla our waitress is very attentive and when we needed something else and she wasn't available the rest of the crew \"jumped\" to cover our needs. I love their team work spirit! Thanks for always giving us great experiences!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to The Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and I left truly disappointed. 

My wife and I had a rare Saturday night to ourselves so I decided to take her out to eat after putting up with me at the Nordstrom Anniversary sale. Once we arrived there was a 25 to 30 minute wait which I didn't mind. Once our pager went off we almost literally broke our necks walking to our table as the floor was so slippery. 

Once seated our waitress Meghan came and took our drink orders. We hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while so it was nice to see some new items on the menu. When we finally decided what we wanted I chose the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage and my wife chose the Chicken Chipotle Pasta.

A few minutes later Meghan came back with our bread. 10 to 15 minutes later Meghan came back and said that our food would be coming soon. By this time a few other groups had been seated and placed their orders as well. Another twenty five minutes later we still have no food. All of the other tables around us had gotten their drinks, appetizers and entrees and we still had nothing!

Finally we got our food almost 45 minutes after being seated. We did not order appetizers just entrees so we had bread and water until our food finally came. By this time I was really feeling some type of way! At least our food as good!

After I got our check and paid I was going to just let it go but I couldn't so I asked to speak to the manager. Once she came over I let her know what happened. I let her know they we had been come to the Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and never once had to wait that long for food. She apologized and offered us a piece of cheesecake.

I usually really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience and some many other better choices I don't know when or if I will ever return."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory always comes to the rescue. The Las Vegas location held to a higher standard when it comes to service and beautiful scenery.  The food is always Louis is in a wide variety of items to choose from. I had  the dynamite shrimp and tater tot's. Yummy. Wifey had the clam chowder and salmon salad with shrimp. Apparently this is the best salad she has ever had. Great customer service and never let down."}
{"text":"We were feeling courageous on a Friday night at 6pm to try and have dinner here, as it had been a while.  

We were lucky to get in right away, as there is usually a wait of about 30 minutes.  

We were seated and promptly served warm bread and drinks.  Our waitress was on top of it and she was pleasant, even though the restaurant was PACKED. 

The app of grilled artichokes were brought out and about 10 minutes later our food.  The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced.

The bf had the BBQ chicken pizza, which is always amazing but this time was especially good by his comments.

I enjoyed the lettuce wrapped chicken tacos (asian).  

Overall, this experience was as good as it usually is.  The only downside is the restaurant is always very VERY loud and table space is very small if you are not seated in a booth (we were not).

For a chain restaurant, this restaurant, especially this location is worth it."}
{"text":"I order take out from here at least once a week. The cashiers are always so sweet and friendly both on the phone and in person. I also love the variety of the menu and consistency of the food I order."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were going to be in a completely different part of town that we live in, so naturally, I had to come to yelp to find an eatery that we could patron for lunch while waiting for my vehicle to be detailed.  I initially found a different place to go, but when we arrived there, it was dead and not at all our style of place to dine al fresco.  
Thankfully, as we were in the Arrowhead area thus surrounded by various other locations, we had options, so ultimately we agreed on The Cheesecake Factory.  Now, I have to make mention that neither one of us is historically a 'fan' of this place and so therefore hadn't been in a very long time, and never together.  Regardless, we gave it a shot and I'm thrilled to report that we're very pleased that we did.  The overall experience, from greeting to ambiance to service and of course the food were all very good.  We definitely recommend this place for lunch and whenever we find ourselves in that area would absolutely keep them in mind to patron again."}
{"text":"Went here after leaving Cleveland for the Cavs Championship parade. It was actually pretty good! The service was wonderful, absolutely no problems. The meal portions are quite large, I took most of my meal home. Prices are decent for the amount of food you get. So if you're around and want to try something new, highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory. 


P.S. Would recommend the raspberry lemonade!"}
{"text":"I was having lunch today with two business executives.  I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad which seemed simple enough. When it was served I began to eat it and noticed there was no chicken.  I politely asked if I had ordered wrong and she said \"no\" the chicken might be on the bottom. I checked, no chicken. I again brought it to her attention and she said she had to show the kitchen to be sure that I was correct.  She then proceeds to take my salad that I had been tossing around to the kitchen
.  They  go through it and she brings the same salad back saying \"yea, you were right they forgot it, they laughed and added some for you\". I would have thought they would have made a new one not played with mine and add chicken to fix it.  I chose not to eat it after others have handled it. I didn't want take it further  because I was with others.  But.... Cheesecake, I was embarrassed enough for us all. Worst service ever!  And an attitude I was shocked by!  I  sure the other people I was with will not return there anytime soon. There are a lot of great places to go at the Biltmore and Cheesecake if no longer one of our choices."}
{"text":"In this day and age, how is it possible that a restaurant a nationwide restaurant no less has no Wi-Fi for their customers?   Food is always average but a good location but not if you plan a working breakfast or lunch.  They have to be missing out on a lot of business clients."}
{"text":"If you're here to eat cheesecake, that's totally fine. You're in the right place.

When it comes to the restaurant, I'm not too fond of eating here. The menu here is diverse for sure, but the dishes themselves have always been good, not great. No matter what I order, I can recall a similar variant that tasted better and costs less. I think that's just the nature of this chain, but if you're dropping more cash I think you should get better food. The cost goes more towards the ambience than anything else.

The free bread is not bad though. Yay free bread."}
{"text":"Poor service, waiter gave my food to the wrong table.  I had to wait 15 minutes for the kitchen to make my food again.  By the time my food arrived everyone else at my table was done eating.  Received nothing but an insencere sorry.  Will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Two days ago on Tuesday (5/23/17), I took my family to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my brother's birthday. Regretfully, we didn't have a celebration--instead, we had a disaster.  It was the most dreadful dining experience we've ever had and I am so upset that it had to happen on a loved one's birthday. We're a very patient and forgiving family with a combined 32 years in the hospitality industry, but your staff sucked every ounce of patience in us. 

We arrived at 7:30 pm. It took 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us after we were seated by the hostess. A server named Jessica S. finally appeared and took our drink orders (we were a party of 3). Our drinks arrived 5 minutes later. As we browsed the menu, she said she'd be back shortly to take our food orders. We decided no appetizers because the restaurant wasn't busy (it was a Tuesday night) and we didn't want to be too full for our main dishes. A basket of bread would've definitely sufficed for the meantime. She vanished without offering any bread, which is customary at Cheesecake Factory. All the tables surrounding ours were receiving fresh baskets of bread. A short while later, I heard Jessica ask the table DIRECTLY beside ours which was seated after us, \"Would you like some bread while your appetizers are being made?\" Sure enough, she served them bread.   

Five minutes became 20 and still no bread and no Jessica, at least not at our table. She was busy providing undivided attention to her other tables. We eventually stopped her and asked for bread; she said a fresh batch was being made. She took our dinner orders and left;with empty glasses in front of her and no question if we wanted refills. I thought to myself, \"Will I have to be asking for every little thing the entire night? But she doesn't look like she's training or overwhelmed. She seems to be on top of things with everyone else.\" I couldn't decipher what was going on. Carelessness? Selective service? At this point, it's 8:30. People who came after us were already eating their entrees, and some were even getting their checks. Jessica would skip our table and ask the others if there was anything they needed. I had to ask a different server walking by if we could get some bread and she happily obliged; yet again, we never got any. We sat there sipping what was left of our drinks, watching Jessica serve everyone else.

If it wasn't for my family, I wanted to leave. They kept saying, \"What's going to be open around this time?\"  Honestly, bar service elsewhere would've been more merciful for a birthday than this. I'm forgiving of wait times and honest forgetfulness from staff, but that night was straight up unforgivable.

It's past 9 pm and still no entrees and no explanation. At least show some consideration and let us know what's happening in the kitchen. Short staffed? Backed up? I got up and went to the hostess stand and told her that I'd like to pay for the drinks and leave. She said she'd need to get the manager Sarah to honor my request. I explained to the Manager how negligent and horrible the service was, to which she was initially/seemingly apologetic. Sarah was shocked at what was happening and said verbatim, \"It's not even that busy tonight.\" She asked if I'd be willing to have a seat and get some food in me while she tried her best to make the situation right. As soon as I walked back, our food mysteriously appeared on our table with a basket of bread.

Sarah returned 5 minutes later as we were eating and asked if we wanted a couple slices of cheesecake to-go on the house. I was offended that that was her solution to the problem, and for a family who didn't want dessert. An entire table of cheesecake could not sweeten this awful experience. We paid the original bill of $70 and that's around the time Jessica would come to our table to ask about refills and such. It was too late. If that was your form of an apology, apology not accepted. You're sorry because you were told on.

I've been a loyal patron of this Cheesecake Factory in Westlake for years. For God's sake, my family even hosts parties of 20-30 people during the holidays. But I was shown two nights ago that we are no longer wanted there. We were always kind and generous, but now I regret the time and money we wasted in the past. And the fact that the Manager never offered any resolution for a family who didn't want dessert made it worse.

I'm sure that when this happens to other guests, better resolutions are made. However, I'm not quite sure what filter your location uses to gauge what kind of treatment a certain people gets over others. You may never share that information, because you can't, but the public will always know the difference and never feel welcomed again. From Michaud's in Strongsville to parties we've catered in Cleveland, I have never seen such poor service with blatant audacity. And no matter what kind of training your staff needs, I suggest you add kindness and fairness to your employee handbook."}
{"text":"I'm actually really disappointed with my recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I think that three stars is rather generous for the sloppy salad and slow service during the lunch hour. I ordered a French Country Salad with crasins instead of beets, while my lunch buddy decided to get the Caesar salad. After we placed our order, the server brought out bread; however, there was only one type of bread in the basket to our disappointment, but oh well no biggie at this point. We didn't see it sever until our food was brought out, which seemed to take quite awhile, but again, no big deal at this point. However, as soon as I went to dig into my salad I noticed that the bits of asparagus, nuts, and goat cheese were all under my lettuce mix. This was strange. I asked the server where my crasins were she said oh sorry I had the cook make you a new salad since we put them directly on the salad (I asked for them on the side because I wasn't sure what I was going to get, crasins or actual cranberries). So, I doubt I got a new salad and just had the crasins taken out, which was why all of my toppings were under the salad. Again, this wasn't a big deal until I noticed that I had a lot of wilted and mushy lettuce in my salad. I was really really disappointed because that's just plain gross. I had the blackish pieces that get all slimy and stick to the other leaves. 

Overall, the service wasn't anything to write home about and the salad quality wasn't very good."}
{"text":"It's a really long wait time since it's just opened which is understandable because it is the only Cheesecake Factory in Canada, so I think people should understand that the line has not stopped yet so expect to wait a few hours especially if you plan to go with a group of people. 2 people I find are usually accommodated faster, and the wait time was about 40 minutes. they give you a buzzer to let you know when you're up for seating so you can shop/ walk around within the area in the meantime. Our server was very polite and kind even though it was super busy, they don't make you feel rushed to come in and leave right away. I liked how they also provided a complimentary butter and bread. My friend and I ordered cheesecake of course which was a a bit pricey, $12 but was actually pretty filling and tasted amazing! I will be back again for the food part of the menu!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait is extremely long (4hrs). We had alfredo chicken pasta which was very smooth and melted in the mouth. Also had the shrimp platter which was good along with bbq chicken pizza which was ok. The meal ended with a cheesecake which was yummy."}
{"text":"Suggestions:

Be ready with your cheese cake order when your waitress takes your drink order as an appetizer.  Food takes a little while so don't skimp on appetizer s.

Tex Mex egg-rolls are a great appetizer

They have lots of other entries but I really like their hamburgers.  After the cheese cake and appetizer you don't want to be carrying your food to go."}
{"text":"Wait time at 9pm was 1.5 hours on a Friday night. So we decided to get takeout instead, we got different cheesecakes: Key lime, snickers, tiramisu, original, Anniversary and chocolate. The coffee took the longest to get. Overall the cheesecake is pretty good, visiting the Cheesecake Factory is more of a novelty."}
{"text":"We went to the new Cheesecake Factory across from the world Market Center. We sat in the bar so we could get in and out fast. We were there over 2 hours... We saw everyone around us being served and finish and we were not served. 
When we asked the manager... Why it was taking so long, she said she would check! 
She came back without our food. She said the time is only 30 min. Old. This was NOT cool. 
We will never go back!!! If you want good service Do Not Go Here! The food was cold and not what we have received at The Cheesecake Factory in California!"}
{"text":"Good morning (in case you're reading this in China?). I dined here on Friday evening with my gal. They sat us literally on top of another couple. Has this place heard of privacy? (For 2 seconds). Also the waiter put his butt in my face? Why? AND WAIT A MINUTE I ALMOST FORGOT, HE ALMOST ELBOWED MY DATE! (Geez, what a jerk). So. The reason this place didn't get 1 star is because the mural on the wall gave my gal and I something to talk about. I DIGRESS.

The omelette tasted like eggs! Thank god. However the fish tacos should have tasted like something that tastes good. (They should leave these to Barrio) Good night (people in America).

Yeip"}
{"text":"I am sorry I am only giving you guys two stars... I always feel bad to do this... but the pricing is not at all worth it. The ambiance is amazing and the cheesecake is of course amazing but as far as the actual food goes, I don't suggest eating here :/. It is way to expensive and not worth it to be honest. Good news is that the employees are very kind and attentive!"}
{"text":"Went on 7/14 (Thursday) for a friends 19th Birthday. It was only a party of 4, we waited about 20 minutes which is normal since it was about 8ish. Our \"waiter\" was by far the worst I've ever experienced at any establishment. It took him a while to get to our table to take our drink requests. Which was okay seeing as we determined what to order. When he FINALLY came over he took our drink orders then started to walk away with out acknowledging he was going to be right back. I said \"I think we're ready to order\" and he turned back around and said \"I have other tables to attend to!\" First of all. What the heck. I've never in my life have I had to deal with such a mannerless individual, especially in the food/customer service industry. 15 minutes later he finally arrives with our drinks and again walked away with no acknowledgement. Another 15 minutes later he finally felt like taking our order and finally gave us a bread basket which only had two slices of bread. Reminder there's a total of 4 people in our party. 
You could clearly tell he was in a bad mood and was taking it out on his guests. He took our order and my friend asked for a burger with no onions and mustard. She got it backward with onions and no mustard. When she told the \"waiter\" he didn't even right it down and barely acknowledged her simple request. At this point we were very upset at how much of a jerk this guy was being and totally took away from our birthday celebration. We ate or food and at the point when we had already finished he finally comes around to ask how food was. Like really? Usually you get asked about 5 min later. 
We were so pissed we didn't even get a cheesecake which was the only reason we wanted to eat there in the first plAce. Not that the \"waiter\" even offered us any dessert in the first place. If your having a bad day leave your issues at the door or if you hate your job then promote yourself to customer. But goodness cheesecake company should be ashamed of this specific worker!! Who knows how many other people ruined their dinners as well. 

Also, I can't begin to describe how filthy our table and area was!!!! There was some type of slime stuff on the floor that my friend stepped in and had dirty shoes. We all had to watch where we stepped for the floor under or table was so nasty and obviously not cleaned or mopped. What a joke. I won't be coming back soon."}
{"text":"First we were following the GPS and could not find the restaurant because it is actually in Caesars Palace at the forum shops. It was very busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table, about 10 minutes.


I ordered the firecracker salmon rolls as my meal, it was good but I thought the salmon was a little underdone. My husband ordered the Hibachi Steak which he loved. He had a lemonade and I had a strawberry lemonade they were both really sweet but our server gave us  water which I added to mine to cut the sweetness.

Our server was wonderful, the staff was very pleasant and the atmosphere was really nice."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review as it is my first as a starving food critic. 

First off the atmosphere in here is nice but very dim and hard on the eyes. 
Ok now the food. I had the Crispy Cuban Egg Rolls. They were delicious, at the Scottsdale chain(previously went and had the sampler). 
The ham and Swiss is perfectly melted onto the wrap to make it melt in your mouth. The mustard sauce is the proverbial cherry on top. 4.5 stars. 

For dessert I got the chocolate mousse cheesecake. One word, delicious. It is one of the best cakes I've had here. The presentation of it makes it look like a 5 star restaurant, taste included. Biting in, the vanilla mascarpone is the first thing that hits the taste buds. It is creamy and rich yet not overwhelming. Next, getting into the chocolate. The mousse was delicious and not too overwhelming. Overall the flavors blend together to create a perfect dessert. 5 stars. 

My only trouble here was the service. If I didn't say when, then why did you stop with the mozzarella? 

Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"I always have a pleasant experience when I go to Cheesecake Factory. The service is superb. Huge servings but the food is ridiculously overpriced. You're just paying for the ambiance. you can get better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here July 30 for the half price per slice NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY. Waited a long time to be seated. They told us 10-15 mins. Ended up being like 45 mins. Had to ask if our name was being called next only to find out they skipped over our name. The manager made us the next call after that was acknowledged. 
We were seated. Our waitor was extremely busy. He was nice but not much customer service. We ordered tex mex egg rolls for appetizers. Pasta for entrees. And cheesecake for dessert. 
Unfortunately both our pasta dishes were at maximum luke warm. The best part of the dinner was the appetizer and dessert."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this location. My fiancée and I came here for our anniversary and was told their was a wait. So she took down our name and told me it would be 15 mins. We waited and waited and waited. Almost an hour goes by and the place did not seem that packed to me so I went to the desk and asked a lady up there and she said oh, I forgot about you. She then said let me get you seated. Well, the waitress was not friendly AT ALL and took our order. The food was cold and when I tried to speak to the waitress she didn't care and sat down our bill. We left upset and paid $50 for a cold dinner."}
{"text":"Dinner and service was mediocre.  The cheesecake was good.  My advice is eat dinner somewhere and come here for dessert."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake factory location is worth the extra drive. The servers are very courteous and attentive. No long waits like strip location. Make sure to save room for the ultimate red velvet cheesecake."}
{"text":"I went with a large group of people on a Friday night.  They don't take reservations, so it took us about an hour to be seated.  Service was prompt, but the waitress had so many tables it took about 45 minutes for the food to come after ordering.  Some of us wanted desert, so that took an extra 45 minutes.  The place is packed with lines coming out the door most of the time.  Personally, I think the food is good, but not good enough to wait for.  I also think prices are pretty high.  Two alcoholic beverages, a main course, and a desert is about 50 bucks a person."}
{"text":"Pretty much every dish I have ordered from their very big menu has been good.  They have variety for everybody, good prices, good service, good drinks and good cheesecakes!  What is not to like?
About this specific location, it is very busy with long wait times.  I honestly prefer going to the off the strip locations.  My favorites are the crab wontons, the avocado rolls, chicken taquitos, the lousiana chicken pasta, herb crusted salmon, jamaican shrimp, shrimp scampi, and stuffed chicken tortillas!....The brown bread served is really good as well as their soups.  Every time I have visitors and I have taken them there, they have absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"It's an overpriced chain restaurant. Sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The portions were ridiculously huge and overpriced for the quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"Loved the avocado chicken club! Was made with very fresh ingredients and the chicken breast was perfectly cooked.  The restaurant is still quite popular so long lineups.  Want for lunch on a weekday and still waited about 30 mins.  The sandwich was so filling so didn't get a chance to taste any of their cheesecake. Next time for sure!"}
{"text":"I always love Cheesecake Factory. It's a staple. Menu is as always a bit daunting but I've ordered pretty much everything and all has been quite tasty.  Best part of course is the cheesecake! Service was great."}
{"text":"Always great food, great staff. Very friendly place. The bathrooms can be better cleaned and stocked but they have very high traffic levels. Children have great options, too."}
{"text":"Corn cakes are good. Wontons not so much goopy. Chicken sandwich was good could be spicier spread."}
{"text":"Terrific wait staff, appetizers, drinks, CHEESE CAKE, and entrees.  Always a fun occasion to go to - and people watch.  Just wish it dished up fewer calories!  
Always excellent - even though it is a chain, and not family owned.  We try to patronize locally owned places to dine - but this \"chain\" is a delightful exception!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night, and we were quickly seated. Standard decor inside/out. We were able to enjoy patio seating which is still warm enough to enjoy in late November with the heaters. Service was outstanding!! 

I love their macaroni and cheese ball appetizer, so I get it as a meal. We got a loaded baked potato tot app to share, it was tasty and under $6! All there food is priced a little higher than most, but I think it's still fair. Love the endless bread!! And the strawberry lemonade, despite it being rediculously sweet, is also a must.  

Be sure to stop in for lunch - their pizza and salad deals are the best. I do not recommend getting their burgers. They taste burned around the edges (charbroiled I suppose) no matter how you ask for them to be cooked. My husband also doesn't like their new fries."}
{"text":"Taylor was great tonight! Awesome service, yummy food and nice patio seating. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Got the shrimp and angel hair. Shrimp was overcooked and not very fresh. The pasta was completely dry on the bottom. Not worth $18.

The waitress was also kind of aggressive with her up sell attempts."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory does some things well but breakfast isn't one of them. Tried an egg dish one more time and yep, they still overcook them, brown and dry.  Way overpriced also, $16 for eggs and coffee... 
I'll be back, but not for breakfast."}
{"text":"A friendly and familiar place was a nice break in a sea of new, one-of, famous chef places to choose from here in Vegas. Somehow it still took us 20min to decide what we wanted (insert laugh here). 
Tucked in the back of Ceasar's Palace, behind the Fall of Atlantis show (giant marble statues of the God's that come to life), the view was great for people watching and the patio, although indoors was much brighter than inside.
We both settled on Omelet's. Me, the California, sub all cheeses for goat cheese, and my mom got the Build Your Own. After having walked the strip for six miles we both went with water for hydration.
Our waitress was so kind and prompt. Our food was delicious and the portions did not disappoint. The prices are more than your typical Cheesecake Factory, but I guess that's expected in Vegas."}
{"text":"I did not want to go since the last two times I was here they messed up my order. Not something simple like a lost side, but no sauce with jambalaya and no chicken on the salad. But I went anyway since wifey wanted to go.

Terrible service. Walked in and no one greeted us. Not any of the half dozen servers, the manager, or the hostess at the front. STRIKE 1.

Hostess finally saw us waiting and took our name and said it'd be a few minutes. A party ahead of us got seated by the manager. While heading back to the front, he stops to chat up a girl server. Then walks past me to the bar to chat up the bar tender. STRIKE 2.

Meanwhile, the hostess is on her phone checking something. When the manager walks by, she puts it away and reorganizes the menus on her table. When the manager walks past her to the bar, she sees me again and asks me if I am ready to be seated now. Why couldn't I have been seated before? Oh, I know... cause you were too busy texting/facebooking/twitting on your phone. STRIKE 3."}
{"text":"Great second time experience there about 2 weeks ago, playing catch up here on reviews!

Our friend Polly wanted to try it and it was her choice via The dice  :D

We each ordered an appetizer, I got the sweet corn tamale cakes and they were AMAZING!   SO YUMMY!

Dinner for me was the cajun chicken/shrimp and sausage with brown rice, it was not listed on the menu so I am thinking they removed it but they made it for me, the first time around though they did not include the sausage so I had to have them make a bit for me and the waitress said no problem at all and within 5 mins I had my sausage  :)

Dessert was amazing, I got the tiramasu cheesecake, my friend got the oreo cookie cheesecake and I liked his a lot better though, mine was just like the tiramasu, didnt really seem like 2 things to me, a cheesecake and a cake but thats ok it was still good.    

Cant wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"In Memorium: Beef Ribs

The Cheesecake Factory is a very expensive restaurant with many items to choose from...yet, stupidly, they lost the best choice on the menu, the Beef Ribs.  Yes, they were over $25 a rack, but they were the best damn beef ribs I've EVER had, period.  So how could they get rid of it?  I don't understand it.

When I inquired about it, they said that they change their menus all the time.  It may be back.  They also mentioned that it was their most requested item off the old menu, which doesn't make any sense.

This four-star review reflects their current menu options...if they ever decide to bring them back, the beef ribs make it an easy 5 stars.

Also, be sure to check out their strawberry lemonade...it's served with sugar around the rim, and it's deliciously sweet and refreshing.  Seriously the best strawberry lemonade I've tasted (comparable to Lucille's Smokehouse, which is also pretty damn good)."}
{"text":"Being a longtime lover of the buffalo Cheesecake Factory location I was extremely excited to find out they were opening one in Toronto! However, being a tourist attraction the 3-3 1/2 hour wait is something not for the faint of heart. The food is great there are an abundance of items on the menu for everyone's taste. I love the mac and cheese balls as well as the avocado egg rolls and the herb crusted salmon. The service has always been top notch as well! However the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the additional 45 minutes to an hour wait for Cheesecake AFTER the meal. The takeout Cheesecake orders and sit down orders get lumped together causing a major delay. This is why tables are sitting around so long and the turnover is so incredibly slow.  Hopefully this issue will be solved once the hype dies down!"}
{"text":"Pretty average food. I've had dinner here about 10 times and never had anything really great. Good dessert."}
{"text":"Went to lunch today with coworkers we had an hour and a half lunch figured this was plenty of time. It did take us a minute to order with the menu being so large. We ordered a salad 2 burgers cooked medium rare and a philly cheese steak plain. It took 45 minutes to get our food. The waitress avoided our table the entire time. I asked someone else to check on our food. The food then came out and the waitress dropped off the food stated she was \"frustrated for us\" that the food took so long. I've been in the service industry for most of my career.... that's not how you handle the problem. We had to have boxes delivered with our food we had no time to eat it at the restaurant. She said the philly is what took so long the burger plates were scorching hot  from sitting under the burner for so long. I won't be going back it was not a good experience in anyway"}
{"text":"This seems to be the go to place when I can't make up my mind. I always attempt to convince myself that I'm going to order something different but I can't seem to get away from the Chinese chicken salad & chicken Madeira. 
They have a huge menu with a wide variety of choices & I love the tropical ice tea. I also need to mention the mood lighting in this place, love that touch :)
We can never seem to make it to dessert but the times we've had it it's always fresh & delicious. If you can't decide on which type of cheesecake to order you can't go wrong with the original slice with strawberries :)
The warm bread is also a nice touch to start getting full before your food arrives."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I think i was smart by coming for Sunday brunch. I got here around 11am and there was so line at all. 

I got the chicken and waffles with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Though the chicken and waffles were good, the poached eggs were overcooked and the hollandaise sauce def wasn't the best I've had. But I will say that the side of potatoes were pretty darn good. 

I also got the white chooclate macadamia nut cheesecake and I love cheesecake, so I was def a fan. 

The service was really good tho! My waitress was really nice, friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"My gf and I stop by to get our usual. She loves their stuffed mushrooms and I like their Chipotle Chicken Pasta. This location always hits the spot on these two things for us. Location is always busy on weekends, expect to wait 15-30 minutes if you are there with a big party."}
{"text":"Always a great dinning experience, but I don't frequent as much since they discontinued the CHICKEN THAI PASTA! Food was good, especially the new Cheesecake, Salted Caramel, great call Jessica N.! YOU were awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite appetizers are Avocado Eggrolls and Stuffed Mushrooms. 
My favorite dishes are Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo and Chicken Bellagio."}
{"text":"I took two hungry 20 yr old guys who were excited to see what all the fuss, buzz and lines were about. (I had been several times in Buckhead - Atlanta - and was very impressed, about 8 years ago, and also in Honolulu ditto.) We went for a late lunch on a Thursday and were seated after a 30-minute wait. Our waitress said that only once, on a stormy day, had she not seen the restaurant full. She was nice, chatty and efficient (bringing water and pop refills for me, asking if we wanted bread, getting check and machine right away when we were ready to go).  However, the three of us agreed that the overall experience was disappointing both absolutely and in terms of our $135 tab. And that we would not go back: too many other neat places in Toronto.

A few examples of CF's under-performance:       

- the guys ordered mixed drinks when we sat down. And waited. We ordered our apps. And waited. The apps came (best part of meal: cheeseburger taquitos and tater tots). No drinks. Small bread basket with butter. No drinks. Waitress apologized 3 times: \"they're making them.\" That was BS. There was no \"they.\"  She finally told us, \"We only have one bartender.\" What sort of nonsense is that? The restaurant is full all the time. They advertise specialty drinks (a pina colada and a burboun based special was the guys' selection). They should have staff to produce them. Especially at downtown prices (11.95 and 13.50). What were we waiting for when we waited for a table? 

- the so-called special feature, the much-vaunted Chicken Bellagio, was a farce: lots of pasta, which was ok - two thinly pounded and breaded breasts with literally a smear or two of the celebrated \"sauce\" on each. Disappointing.

- my chicken salad sandwich (which I remembered from Atlanta) was served on delicious toasted brioche.  The enjoyment stopped there. I had ordered it without lettuce - it came with. The waitress apologized but did not offer to take it back and have it re-made. Left me to scrape off the lettuce.  The mayo might have covered a third of each bread slice's inside (3 slices - a generous portion). The filling  ok, even tasty - but a huge proportion of (fresh!) tomato to chicken salad. $16.95 -  BAH - again, the sloppy nature of the dish made it unacceptable. 

We finished with two slices of the cheesecake, the key lime tasty enough. $10 (ok, $9.95) - I asked waitress why Summerhill Market and I presume other outlets sell (left-over??) slices for $5.95 or even half that (must be \"well-aged\" lol).

Anyway, I MIGHT take two hungry ten year olds if CF ever did what decent restaurants do and took reservations. But they'd probably enjoy Spaghetti Factory as much and my wallet would be less impoverished.  Really disappointing. One visit IS fair for judgment as no way our experience compared with the US. Don't go - my advice. Or ask yourself \"Why would I go?\" Sad..."}
{"text":"Ordered Curbside TOGO for an Oreo cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, key lime cheesecake, and a Snickers bar cheesecake. Yummy!!!! They are open on Saturdays despite what it says here on the app! Curbside quoted me about 25 minutes, However it took longer than 25 minutes for my order to be delivered to my car, almost an hour. Ordered at approximately 8:24pm and finally received my cheesecakes at 9:15pm. The curbside waitress was polite and explained to us that the dessert orders were insane tonight so we understood! Cheesecakes were yummy though! :)"}
{"text":"I usually only write bad reviews but as you can see by the stars this is not the case. The food overall was good. Not great and not terrible. My salad was excellent but my girlfriend wasn't a fan of her sandwich. We also got two apps and cheesecake afterwards. What I really want to talk about was our service. It was incredible. I think our waitresses name was Lynn (could be wrong). She was very engaging and knowledgable about the long menu. We asked a lot of questions I mean a lot and she answered all of them and was very patient. We eat out way too much and this was the best service we have had in a long time. I'm done. Food was good service was fantastic! We do not eat at the cheese factory and only went because we had a gift card. We would have never gone there but would go again because we had an awesome waitress. If only everyone was loving life like she was!"}
{"text":"We like the menu variety I had the Turkey avocado club yum wife enjoyed the beautiful Pork chop and the cheese cake which one to choose tuff call"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has always been my favorite go-to restaurant until tonight and I'm hugely disappointed in the service received. Granted it was busy but we sat at the smallest table so close to other couples they may as well have been sitting in our laps. My fiancé ordered the Orange Chicken without the Orange zest because it tastes nasty with pieces of orange peel garnished all over it...I don't blame him, I agree nobody likes orange peel. So the waitress acknowledges that yes indeed he ordered it without orange zest and sends it back. Out comes the manager to further clarify that he didn't want orange zest. Offers a side salad or soup on the house. Meanwhile I'm more than halfway through my meal which tastes fine ... A little on the dry side but I always get it but at that point I felt bad eating in front of my fiancé so I pause for a bit. A bit turns into 20 minutes he still hasn't gotten his food yet and at this point I want a box for mine. Usually when a customer hasn't eaten there food or touched it after chowing down it... usually constitutes the need for a box. Nope...everyone else around us got boxes. I try to get the waitresses attention but all I got was an eye roll. My fiancé finally gets his meal and it's mediocre, he finishes and the waitress is eager to get us out of there so she grabs the food. Doesn't offer us Cheesecake, or boxes. Peace Cheesecake Factory! You lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Started off rough. The host stand didn't really know what it was doing (I think it was turnover which might've been why), so we waited a long time to be seated and they didn't seat anyone who came in for about 15 minutes. Normally, I wouldn't mind but my grandma has a hard time standing for a long time and since no one was being seated, none of the seats in the waiting area opened up. Regardless, our waitress Sandy really turned it around. It was my little sister's birthday, Sandy made it a point to remember our names, sing to my little sister with a dessert specifically for her (wrote her name on it), took amazing care of us even with our difficult orders and questions about the menu (my father is vegan), and never complained even though we were a very needy table. She truly wanted to serve us and it's extremely refreshing. I worked as a waitress/bartender for six years and I can honestly say Sandy is the best waitress I've ever had. If you go to this Cheesecake Factory, ask to sit in Sandy's section! Oh and the avocado rolls were DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"What can i say,  I love the cheesecake factory. I stop in a few times a year and I love it!  I've never had a bad meal.  Sure it's on the pricey side,  but It's worth it.  I had the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was delicious!  My friend had the Chicken Bellagio...that will be the next thing i try she said it was delicious as well.  We spilt the Turtle cheesecake for desert. 2 thumbs up.  Our waiter was attentive and entertaining.  This location consistently exceeds my expectations. Give them a try,  you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try a Cheesecake Factory for quite some time... I was excited to get the chance to on my latest trip to Las Vegas and I was not disappointed!  We went for lunch on a Tuesday and did not have a wait to get seated (yay!).  The prices of items on the menu were surprisingly very reasonable.  The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  My husband had a buffalo burger and fries.  He said it tasted great and was very filling.  I had the herb crusted filet of salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  I was very pleased with it; tasted fresh and delicious.  For desert we shared the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  Holy. Cow. It was so good.  You must eat desert when you go there... it is named after cheesecake after all!  Worried about not having room for it? Eat it first!"}
{"text":"Their Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms was beyond delicious. I asked to sub bow-tie pasta with angel hair, and it was a truly tasty meal. You would say - pasta and chicken - nothing special, but I probably would go to that restaurant just to order it again. 

The portion of the dinner is huge. We ordered a few appetizers and we were almost full after appetizers. When they brought the main meal, I wished I didn't eat anything before that. 

I've been to quite a few chain restaurants, and this one without any doubts is one of my favorites. The restaurant is big, the booth was very comfortable. I also love the location. After dinner, take some time and walk around Legacy Village and enjoy some shopping."}
{"text":"There's a separate take-out counter for cheesecakes - no line up! I picked up a giant slab of the lemon raspberry cheesecake: good texture but a bit too sweet."}
{"text":"The food was really slow getting to us. Our waiter acted deaf and didn't hear requests. My vegetables were way undercooked or just plain cold."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food! You gotta try the stuffed mushrooms. My husband and I have gone here for our last two Anniversary \"early dinners\" that have landed during the week which is great! Still a lot of people but the place is so large you can find a corner that is cozy enough to enjoy your meal and company."}
{"text":"Service are good! Food portions r large and big! Godiva cHeesecake always is the best!! But waited so long for table!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites for satisfying a sweet tooth, and the food isn't bad either. Service is always attentive and prompt, sometimes to a fault. There are only so many interruptions I care to have during a sitting. That's just me, you may love the extra attention. We personally love the setting and just about everything about this place."}
{"text":"I will definitely go back to the Cheesecake Factory . The service was great and the food was even better. My boyfriend got the meatloaf and he said it was the best meatloaf he has ever eaten and I got the three cheese pasta and that was amazing. It was really worth the money!"}
{"text":"Tried the new super antioxidant salad... AMAZING!!! No meat or cheese in it ... But very filling!"}
{"text":"this place has great food and amazing customer service. a customer was lashing out at a waitress just a couple feet away from my table. and after the incident the manager Rob walked over to us and apologized for what we had to see. It was very kind of him to do that."}
{"text":"Really great service.  The wait wasn't long even though it was crowded.  We sat at the bar while we waited for our table.  The staff was very kind and attentive despite how busy it was.  Ordered steak that was prepared well.  Martinis were perfect.  They have a lot to choose from and the cheesecake was pretty good."}
{"text":"This location is pretty much the same as all other Cheesecake Factory locations, except that you have to walk past a bunch of glitz, high-end stores.  Hard not to stop and shop on the way to the restaurant!  It's also right in front of a Caesar Palace amenity - an aquarium and a talking statue show.  Great way to occupy your time while you wait for your table, without spending any more money."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here but today I had the saltiest chicken Madeira.  Headache started to heat up.  Luckily their manager came and apologized.  Overall Great staff, great management.  I can forgive them for one mistake.  But usually the food  tastes great."}
{"text":"The wait tonight wasn't bad at all. We arrived around 6:30 pm and were seated within 10 minutes. Our server was friendly and quickly came on over to take our drinks, and bring over the yummy bread basket they start you on with. 

Our orders consisted of:

Chicken carbonara: Yummy! Just perfect! 

Shrimp jambalaya: Good, full of flavor!

Kids chicken alfredo: Creamy! My niece loved it!

Shrimp with angel hair: This plate is NOT worth $19. Consisted of 4 pieces of shrimp and TONS of diced tomato and pasta. This should be renamed to a diced tomato with angel hair plate. Skip it!

All in all the ambience is perfect, the building is beautiful, and of course the cheesecake is YUMMY!"}

{"text":"Last night me and hubby went to have a dinner night out. I'm yelping bc the service was fantastic. It was refreshing to have a friendly and hard working server bc we all know pittsburgh isn't known for that. Thank you Grace!!! Pens game at home so it wasn't as packed as normal. Also, the gluten free pasta options are the best. I recommend this location even if you have to wait. Ps of course we ended up leaving with a cheese cake .. red velvet!!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service! The staff will go out of their way to make your meal exactly what you want!"}
{"text":"Very busy! And I don't think it's worth the wait or price... but if you want an absolutely god awful amount of food this is the place for you. I got the salmon, my friend got the blt and neither of us could finish our meals! So if there is one solid thing about the cheesecake factory it's the size of helpings you get!"}
{"text":"I'm a long-time lover of The Cheesecake Factory! Even when I lived in California, I was a big fan of my \"regular\" chipotle chicken pasta and caesar salad. I am pleasantly surprised that the food tastes exactly as good here in AZ!

However, this visit to the Cheesecake Factory was different than the dozens of other times we've dined here. Mainly because our server made me and my family feel as if we were the guests of honor! Michael, our server, gave us his undivided attention. It was lunch hour (Around 1 PM on Saturday) and even though you could tell that there was a lot of pressure because of the rush, Michael not only managed, but surpassed our service expectations by being quick, responsive, and paying attention to the little details. (Like making sure we were never without refills).

It is servers like Michael that make customers come back, not just the amazing pasta. Lol."}
{"text":"went for drinks and dessert with my best-friend, tangie, during my recent stint to the metropolitan area.  dropping in at the biltmore location, we both found parking right out front.

undecided on my beverage, i decided to try something that caught my eye...a blueberry mojito.

if I can say this without sounding girly - simply fabulous.  i can't find any other way of describing this drink.  yes, it is made for the guy that simply cannot handle a man's drink. unlike tangie's \"on the rocks\".  she had something that would grow hair on my smooth chest.... 

for dessert we entertained ourselves with a delicious strawberry shortcake. even though we shared, we were unable to finish this delight.

first time i have been to a cheesecake factory and found immediate seating... granted, it was after 10pm.

never had a bad meal or time at this chain.

thanks, tangie - you made my night."}

{"text":"Came here on a weekday around noon and there was already and 1.5h line waiting to be seated.

Pros:
- Just like the one in the states
- Huge portions
- Good service
-Good food
- Nice ambiance 

Cons:
- Pricey"}
{"text":"This is one of our regular places. Portions are huge and the dishes are seasoned with a ton of garlic (makes your meal really flavorful but having so much garlic does have its draw backs :-). All that said, the food is super good and decadent. You can't order a bad meal. I especially like the clam chowder (served Fridays), Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and the Chinese chicken salad."}
{"text":"Our first visit to TCF ever! Really loved our appetizers got the pork belly sliders, definitely recommended! Also loved the Georgia Peach blended drink. Service was wonderful and surprised by the quickness of the staff. We will be back to this location!"}
{"text":"I literally came for the avocado egg rolls! The dipping sauce that is comes with is a sweeter flavor and then  mixed with the salty egg rolls are a good combo!

For another appetizer I ordered the appetizer caesar- the thing was huge!! and this was the appetizer size? Defiantly could split the salad. 

For main entree got the chicken Bellagio! It was good , nothing special to write home about. It's a flatten chicken cutlet over a bed of angel hair pasta and like a pesto sauce. To me cheesecake has this large menu but lacks the \" taste\" factor since they have such menu!

Ordered the red sangria to drink with the meal - it was tasty but I was pretty appalled that it was $9.25 ..I could have easily had three."}
{"text":"I am a customer of over 35 years and have never had any problems EVER!!!!....I ordered vegan Cobb salad and it was absolutely horrible...They sent it out with the core of the iceberg lettuce in big hunks and it was yellow ....not fresh and certainly a disappointment..What was even more disappointing was the sorry behind of a manager Chris who never apologized and instead said we always use that in our salads....my reply no you dont...I have been a serious customer for 30 something years...planning parties, luncheons and events...I am deeply disappointed and will be contacting corporate on this location.."}
{"text":"Always good food.  Great food wish we made it to this part of town more.  Have had problems with service in the past but they seem to be much better.  Will be back for more....cheesecake."}
{"text":"Friday night 4hrs to get a table for 6 (started lining up before 5pm). Staff were young and energetic, food was surprisingly good, portions were big, but it's a huge time commitment. The table turnover is very slow; there was major confusion when it came time to bring over the cheesecakes.

Vegetarians: there's not much for you in terms of entrees - veggie burger and salad. But there are lots of great appetizers instead.

I opted for the fish and chips, they were on the salty side but still good and the potion was generous.

I'll come back in a few years or just drive to one in Buffalo to avoid the crowds next time."}
{"text":"Remember: long lineups are inevitable, go with a small group, have their cheesecake! But wait, I've got some tips and tricks to always get in with the least waiting time and how to enjoy your visit.

The hype of the Cheesecake Factory coming to Toronto is insane! Both a blessing and a plague for the restaurant. Many have been upset about the wait and how the lines are handled, many are upset about the wait time for even takeout, and many were upset about the slow service. They seem to have a service model that ensures you have ample time to browse the menu, dine, chat, enjoy your meal, and then some - seatings are designed to be two hours regardless of time of day or anything else! Plan accordingly for this - get there early to start lining up, and don't book set appointments for afterwards.

The best time to go is for brunch - weekdays are great for smaller crowds, weekends have their comprehensive brunch menu. First service is 10am, and the mall opens at 9:30am on the weekends - showing up at 9:30-9:45 will guarantee you a spot in their first service! Sound too early? Think again - for those great brunch spots downtown Toronto or in the heart of Unionville, you've probably had to plan to get there super early and still have to wait. 10am seating doesn't mean 10am eating either - you'll have plenty of time to settle down, order coffee, browse the menu...food could come at 11am and you'll still have plenty of time to eat!

The lunch portions are more than enough for a meal, and the dinner portions are quite large and carb-heavy in general. If you're looking to try a bit of everything and save room for cheesecake, definitely go for lunch sizes! Their fish and chips, orange chicken, sandwiches and pastas are actually tasty! Many think they've been overhyped, but for the price and portion, flavours we're actually good and it was good value for money. Seating is generally comfortable and the high ceiling makes the place well ventilated. Service is nice and very familiar with the menu, and quite attentive despite the long duration of seating and many tables they attend.

If you're planning a trip to Yorkdale, the Cheesecake Factory is the perfect treat to start your day. Dinner fare is close to impossible to get into since the wait time is so long (2 hours!!) and there's lots of volatility (going too early the lineup is not open, going too late the lineup is too long). If you're only looking for cheesecake, takeout takes about 30min for them to process orders - excluding time lining up to place your order. It's a huge crowd inside the restaurant at their cake counter, but worth it for the treat!

Alternatively, hop in your car and head down to Buffalo - its a bit longer of a drive but a day trip nonetheless!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location quite a few times. I have never had a problem. The food is always good and the cheese cake is great. I gave it minus one star because as others have said your server quality can very quite a bit. On one trip I will have great service and never need to ask for anything. However other times my order will be slightly wrong or they will forget to bring something or they wont refill my drink for almost the entire meal.  Other then that I enjoy it and will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Am a devoted fan of the miso salmon--the buttery miso sauce and the salmon grilled to perfection pleases me every time I order it.  My sister had the herb encrusted salmon with the rosemary potatoes, which she really enjoyed (although I wasn't excited about the flavor or presentation).  My bro-in-law had the house salad and the wasabi seared ahi.  He's from Hawaii, too, and enjoyed the fresh ahi after scraping off the wasabi-flavored crust.  I tried it and found it very much lacking in seasoning, it was way too thick of a dry crust, and there was no sauce so we had to doctor it up with some soy sauce.  Service is very attentive, as usual, and we had a great table with a nice view--thank goodness, or I might have lowered the amount of stars.  Kind of disappointing visit this time around and I wanted so badly to have my family rave over this place.  The mango key lime cheesecake we ordered was supposed to be the redeeming dish, but it was way too sweet and the coconut added to the impacted hard crust didn't help, and it seemed like all the flavors didn't combine well enough to make this worthwhile ordering.  I guess it's all about ordering the right, signature dishes, which we failed to do in 3 out of the 4  tries we had."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times the past few years. It's not really a go to place because it's a little pricey. Usually I eat here either to catch up with friends, or if guests staying over wants to try it.  My experience overall has always been good with no complaints on service. 

Though their menu is vast I think the entrees seem a bit boring. There seems to be more chicken entrees than anything else. I ordered a chicken shrimp jambalaya. It was good and they were generous with shrimp. Perfect meal for people who likes spice and who's not afraid of carbs.

How can you not leave this place and not order a cheesecake? Well I did that. Between the appetizers and my entree I was way too stuff to order one. It's ok. I'm sure the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake will always be there for me."}
{"text":"MEH. Exactly how I still feel about it.


My mother and I were trying to think about a place to go and have lunch. She lives in the Anthem area, and we were trying to stay close by. She brought up the Cheesecake Factory. I was neither excited, or sad. Good opportunity, right?

This place was busy, but it wasn't full to the brim. We didn't have to wait long for a table... maybe three minutes. I told the hostess that there were 2 (meaning two adults,) and one highchair.

Some how, this converted to three adult menus, and no high chair. Two different ladies told me that they would bring me a high chair, before a third one brought me one.....after she finished her conversation, of course.

Our waitress comes by and asks us for our drink order (2 waters with lemon.) No straws. We ask for straws while we continue to look at the HUGE menu. 

Now, I don't know how Cheesecake Factory's black straws come, but ours came UNwrapped, and the waitress felt the desire to put them in our drinks for us. I hope she washed her hands.

She leaves us, and we decide on what we want. Menus closed, she passes us. 
Passes us, again.
aannnndd again. 
My mom finally flags her down. The waitress said that she wasn't \"aware\" of our readiness.

*sigh* whatever.

My mom has appetizers, the tuna tar tar, and the white bean hummus.

I ask for the Spicy crispy chicken sandwich. I ask what type of cheese is put on the sandwich.

\"Jack\".

Do you have Provolone?

We have cheddar, blah blah blah blah. We can do a shredded mozzarella on it for you. 

OKAY, so is that a NO, that you don't have provolone? Gotcha. 

We wait a decent amount of time for our food. Thank goodness for their bread and butter, which you now have to ASK for.

My mom's tar tar was small. Personal appetizer small. In my opinion, not enough to share.

Her hummus was just thrown in the bowl, with a piece of the flatbread already in there, getting soggy, most likely.

My sandwich was nothing special. Honestly, I've had a better one, out of a box, frozen. and it cost me $1 from my grocery store.

It comes out, on a \"toasted\" brioche bun. With a rather large piece of fried chicken, that looks like it is missing from a red and white striped bucket.

Why this is called \"spicy\", I will never know. Even with the entire side of chipotle mayo that 
came with it, it was pretty bland.

Blah Meh food, and meeeeeeeeehhhh service? Not so much."}
{"text":"Two cups of coffee and two pieces of cheesecake well over $20. Give me a break! I could have bought a whole cheesecake for less than that. Service was good. Too much whipped cream. Silverware was full of spots from the dishwasher. Next time I will just eat at home."}
{"text":"Its good place to eat they give lots i had been to one in walden gallery mall in western new york thats how i learned about this place with a friend then they opened one here in the toronto area. It was busey here when it first opened in toronto ont you wont go wrong when you there"}
{"text":"Totally hyped. Weird how everything new that comes to Toronto gets all the buzz and then it creates the ultimate line-up. The Cheesecake Factory is no different yet if you go to Buffalo or anywhere in the States, it's just like another restaurant down the street.

Almost four months since Cheesecake Factory opened here, the wait is still pretty much the same. I went on a Saturday during the weekend and cumulatively, it took 3 hours from line up to being seated. It sounds long but in reality it's not too bad since 2.5 hours of it I was able to shop around Yorkdale. Only caution is that you need to be within a certain range for the buzzer to work (you'll be good as long as you get back within the period they tell you to).

The restaurant interior was quite luxurious and grand, especially at night for dinner where the ceiling decor and lights were lit - it reminds me a little bit of Vegas. However, I would say overall it's still dim and tables were fairly close to one another.

I have to admit it took me quite a while to choose the dish I want. There were just too many choices! For two people, we landed on ordering two specialties: Sheppard's Pie and the Chicken Riesling, plus a Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake to go.

As my boyfriend states, the Sheppard's Pie was one of the best he has ever tried and I would agree. Funny part is that it doesn't look like your typical Sheppard's Pie within an elevated flat dish. Nevertheless, the taste was savoury and flavourful while everything mixed well together.

Chicken Riesling on the other hand, was good but not super good. It consisted of chicken breast which was cooked nicely and soft, but there's nothing too special about it. However, what blew my taste buds was actually the sauce and how well it mixed with the pasta.

Lastly, the S'mores cheesecake was great but more on the pricey side ($9.95). Every layer was smooth like mousse (yet it's not mousse) and every bite was filled with texture. I enjoyed the cheesecake and was surprised it didn't come off as sweet as I thought. Overall, it's a good experience but won't be too sure if I can devour this every week if I had the chance.

P.S. The portion sizes are HUGE! Basically 85% chance you will be doggy-bagging your meal and most likely ordering a cheesecake to-go like me if you insist on trying their signature dessert :)"}
{"text":"We went here for a good Saturday lunch, and it was great. Our waiter Daniel was very outgoing and funny and nice! He made good recommendations for our choice of meal and he made us aware of the specials, definitely going back! THANK YOU DANIEL!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! Clean, warm, energetic atmosphere with a feel of privacy. Not overcrowded at all. The hospitality is warm, inviting and pleasant. 

I ordered the Vietnamese summer rolls as an appetizer and garlic noodles for an entree closing it out with chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. The bread alone was great, but every morsel my fork touched was like an upgrade from the last bite!! Extremely well seasoned with perfect temperature to dive right in!

Worth every penny then some"}
{"text":"The place is alright, I personally do not think that it is worth the wait that you have to go through to get in. 
Most importantly, I do not think that this is a good place for cheesecake. I have tried it there, and it did not meet my expectation of a place named THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.
Otherwise the staff is nice, environment is pretty good. 
Was gonna give it a 3 Star, but I thought it would have been harsh just because I do not think their cheesecake taste that good."}
{"text":"Only go for the desserts! The food is only okay. I've read reviews about the \"ambience\".....what ambience? The initial set of silverware that I'm given is always dirty. Even the \"clean\" silverware looks like it's seen better days along with the plates. The finish is coming off the tables. These things make me wonder about their overall cleanliness. The bathrooms are dimly lit so who knows what they're hiding in there. I hadn't been there in a while for these reasons; however, I popped in today for a quick bite while shopping and nothing has changed. I was given dirty silverware, there was something floating in my water and my food that was served on a really stratched up plate was only okay. 
Just grab your dessert to go and use plastic utensils!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite places to dine at. They always meet these expectations; High quality, good tasting food, excellent beverages, very good service, and a classy ambiance. You normally have to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated. There's a very good reason why people wait that long to be seated. 

Based on my experience from yesterday, I had to give them four, instead of five stars. We were told there was a 40 minute wait, which seemed to be pretty accurate. I noticed that they wasted a lot of time, and energy on trying to find 4 or 5 parties who had obviously left. On several occasions they walked through the bar, waiting area, and exterior of the restaurant calling these people's names. A more efficient way of handling it would be to activate the buzzer, walk through once or twice calling their names, then move on. I felt our server wasn't very friendly, and a bit slow. The food was very good. I would highly recommend the crab bites, and the Steak Diane With Salmon Combination. The fried zucchini was okay... They were good, just not excellent. I was impressed at how clean the bathroom was, based on how busy they were. 

I would definitely return to this Cheesecake Factory again. I would also recommend people eat there as well."}
{"text":"We went for dessert late at night .  You have to try the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake.  A Cheesecake Factory Original - Layers of Moist Chocolate Cake, Chewy Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake. 

I am not much of a desert eater, but this one knocks it out of the park for me!  So good!  Chocolate cake, brownie, toasted coconut and chocolate chips with whipped cream?  Oh man this doesn't miss a thing!"}
{"text":"We just moved here from California and have always had great experiences with the cheesecake factories out there. But today our meal was decent until the server spilled my mother in laws dinner in her lap and then apologized and offered to make another one. The manager came by about 5 minutes later and was talking to my mother in law like it was her fault. Completely condescending. It was an accident obviously, my mother in law didn't do anything wrong, the server did and she took the appropriate actions to make it up to her. But once the manager came by she had an attitude and said well I need to clean that up and it'll take a really long time to make you a new one so all I can do is give you a piece of cheesecake. She put a menu down and walked away. We waited another 10 minutes for either the manager or waiter to come by and the manager barked \"what piece of cheesecake do you want?\" My mother in law said \"none, thanks\" and the manager scowled at my mother in law and walked away. Her attitude needs to go. We had a nice time until that fiasco appeared. We didn't ask for anything extra, nothing free, etc. yet the manager had an attitude like we were the worst customers she had ever served. Being a manager of a big restaurant, you can't come at customers that way. Otherwise the food was good, at least what I had, my mother in law on the other hand can't really tell ya."}
{"text":"First and foremost- I want to state this review is NOT about the food. The food is always exceptional, which is why I will give 2 stars. 

However, if you want to read a review about the Customer Service, please continue reading...I will try to make it as short as possible...

My fiancé and I are expecting our new bundle of joy in less than a month, I craved the Four Cheese Pasta and a good cheesecake. It was safe to safe this was our last date before our little one enters the world. We ended coming in for a late dinner at around 9pm on a Friday night, needless to say, it was NOT busy. 

Greeted by the hostesses and seated immediately in a very well good spaced booth. Our server came immediately, but I never recalled getting her name (I like addressing people on a first name basis, so yes I would have remembered). 

After receiving our beverages, we were asked if we were ready to order. We needed a couple minutes until we actually decided what appetizers we agreed on. Our server came back around 10 mins later and asked if we were ready. I ordered the calamari and my fiancé got the Dynamite Shrimp. When our appetizers came, it was not our sever who came to bring it to the table, trust me this will be important. 

We enjoyed our appetizers for about 15 mins. and then our server came back asked if I wanted more water, I informed her I did and after she came back she asked if another order was needing to be placed.

I ordered my Four Cheese pasta and after declining the added chicken - she was going to walk away. Uhmmm...excuse me? My fiancé is sitting right next to me, why the hurry? He had to state what he wanted to have her turn around and get her attention again. 

Okay, our food comes out - again, our server did not bring it nor did the girl who brought our appetizers, I believe it was another server (due to uniform). While this pleasant, smiling (not my) server was going to ask \"can I offer you fresh...\" here comes our sever cutting her off, \"would you like some fresh grated cheese\"? Not only did she cut off her teammate, she never said thank you for delivering our food for her. I'm just shocked with the lack of teamwork she displayed. 

Dessert comes around, we ordered. This is probably the only time I seen her serve something....our cheesecake and OUR BILL. 

Unbelievable. Notice I never used her name, until now because I didn't get it until I got my bill and that's because it was on the receipt. 

Megan S, I highly advise you find another job if you are unsatisfied with your current one as a server. If the food wasn't as good like the way you presented yourself at your customer service tonight, I would be making a phone call to the GM of this.

The service definitely does make my dinner and my choice of where I spend my money a priority. Never and I mean never coming back to this location. 

We've only seen our server at her convenience:
1. Greet
2. Food order (which actually was our appetizers)
3. Water and Our actual food order (but Megan you were in such a rush to leave, we had to stop you)
4.  When you rudely interrupted the happy server who served our food. 
5. When you ready to close our bill, served our cheesecake. 
6. Picked up our bill while we were still eating our dessert, said thank you while walking away.

Never felt so rushed. 
- okay I'm done. 

Thank you Megan S."}

It's also one of my favorite restaurants to eat at and we've come here for birthdays, anniversaries, holiday meals, meetings, meet-ups, and to satisfy cravings. My family and I have always gotten good service at this location and their list of meals on the menu dose not disappoint. 

Will continue to go this location and this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was worrying about the time response of the waitress because the restaurant was almost full but she was very nice and responded promptly to our request.. This isn't a fast food restaurant so keep in mind you'll spend $$ + tips, the menu is really big so ask what's the specialty. The food is delicious, hot and different from any other place. Remember to save space in your stomach for cheesecake time!"}
{"text":"Best place ever!! Great food great service. I highly recommended this place. First time I ate in this place I was so amaze how the waitress were on you, no mistake food on tim."}
{"text":"The food is good, the cheesecake tastes pretty fresh but the strawberry cheesecake only had 3 strawberries on it and the food was pretty underwhelming. Overall the 1.5 hour wait did not seem worth the food or service."}
{"text":"The menu is huge and the portions even bigger. The food is mediocre, I feel like they depend more on portion size rather than actual flavor. The cheesecake is good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"We waited about 1h45mins however people know there's a wait so can't complain about that. The food was surprisingly good and the portions were quite large. The service was excellent and they're pretty well organized. Overall satisfied. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Although the wait was pretty long, (hour and a half for 6) my family enjoys dining here whenever we're in Vegas. Food seems to taste better here than the one in California. Service was good and my medallions were a perfect medium rare :)"}
{"text":"Ok so I've been to The Cheesecake Factory in three states and this location provided a decent experience. The wait for the food was extremely long but our party of four enjoyed our meals for the most part. I'm a fan of the small plates and the crispy crab bites here were the smallest once's I've seen. I guess everything really IS bigger in Texas, huh?

The fish and chips received rave reviews as did the chicken and biscuits. My mom really loved the gravy that came with it. The food itself gets four stars but I can't get over the wait time after ordering your food. That plays a big part especially if you're on a time crunch."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is always busy and always a wait but it is also always a true experience and todays we nothing less than stellar. We celebrated my daughters Sweet 16 with a Girls Lunch and our waitress Jenna was the total bomb! She was so friendly and excellent at making suggestions when we were ordering. 
We started with their Fried Mac and Cheese - it's not like any other I have ever had. I could make a meal out of this appetizer alone. The balls are about two inches around and you get 4 to an order. They are so creamy and the Panko style breading is never heavy or greasy like some fried appetizers. And the creamy marinara style sauce with them is good to the last bite! 
My daughter had the Pasta DiVinci and was so happy. She shared a hue with me and I loved the lightness of its sauce. Even the lunch portion was loaded with mushrooms and chicken and she brought home a large bit of it still! 
I had the crab bites from their small plates selection. 6 bites size crab cakes and I asked for a side of their romelaude  to make them more New Orleans style. It was the perfect size plate for me to enjoy knowing we were planning on dessert. I mean HOW could you not get dessert at this place?!?! Lol 
Chara ordered the small house salad and likewise it was more than large enough for her. The mixed greens were fresh and beautiful and she loved the vinaigrette they paired with it. 
For dessert we each chose a different cheesecake and then shared! Salted Caramel, Godiva and Tiramisu. Each was pure perfection and ended our meal perfectly. Jenna had even decorated Rhyans and included a candle! We got to sing Happy Birthday and it was a really sweet note to end on. My birthday is NYE... think I wanna go back!"}
{"text":"Patio, huge menu, and awesome drinks... Cheesecake Factory is always a good choice."}
{"text":"I had a mai tai. It was great.  Jessica was our waitress. She was very nice and helpful. The avocado egg roll was better than BJs!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! I had the salmon miso and it was so good. Awesome service given by Erin.  Not sure if I spelled her name correctly. The table lighting can be brighter so it's easier to review the long menu selection. Lots of food to chose from.  If it's your first time you should research what they have. Banana cream cheesecake is superb."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ordered cheesecake factory through door dash. I ordered the Evelyns favorite pasta. When I went in for my second bite I noticed a long black hair in my food. So disgusting. I called cheesecake factory to let them know and they said they couldn't do anything for me because I ordered through door dash. A hair in my food is not a result of door dash. It's a result of improper hygiene in their kitchen. I will not be ordering cheesecake factory again after the experience I had. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has been a long time favorite of mine. I have never been disappointed in a meal at any location. 

Service can occasionally be slow if you come around 3-4pm which we usually do, probably shift change. We like that time because it's generally not packed yet. Friday and Saturday day evenings you can expect to wait for a seat. National Cheesecake day is also pretty crazy but their service is pretty decent and quick. 

Before I cared about what I ate, I used to order off the regular menu. The portions are so large you can split three ways or bring home leftovers...the leftovers taste even better sometimes! I still LOVE the avocado egg rolls and the sauce that comes with them. Must try! The bread they bring is always good as well. This time the bread was nice and warm. The brown bread and sourdough are equally delicious. 

Skinnylicious menu- this is the menu I usually pick from now. The servings are more normal and the calories are MUCH lower. Don't let the word \"skinny\" fool you, all the food on this menu is huge on flavor and still satisfying! My favorites are the Mexican lettuce wraps, the flatbreads, burgers and the side salad that comes with the burgers/sandwiches. 

Cheesecake- really, you can't go wrong!! I eat off the skinny menu so I can easily eat dessert. Top ones for me are original(so good), chocolate tuxedo mousse, red velvet, and Godiva. If you bring me any cheesecake on the menu I will eat it though. They also have a low carb cheesecake. Or if you're wanting a guilt free dessert you can opt for a bowl of strawberries. I usually bring my cake home to enjoy later.

Ambiance- it's quite pleasant inside although it can get loud. The booths are better than tables. Sometimes with a table you can end up sitting next to some very uncomfortable people who just sit there and awkwardly stare at each other. 

Cheesecake Factory has been one of my all time favorite restaurants! Can't go wrong with pages and pages of menu options. There's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Having a very hard time with this. Here goes....please don't misunderstand the food here is amazing. Stopped by today for a drink or two and placed a togo order. I ordered a salad, full size. It was lunchtime. I  wanted to save half to take to work tomorrow. Normally I  can't finish a lunch portion but it's never enough for another meal. Well when I got home and saw my salad,  it was barely a lunch portion. I had the bbq ranch chicken salad. This is my favorite dish, so I know this salad well. I always get an extra dressing because the salad is so big there is never enough. Well the salad was so small I had an extra dressing  left. Used it on my bread. Oh did I say bread, yeah well I  ate the bread which I don't normally eat bread, that's how small the salad was. Quite disappointed. And I have nothing to bring to work tomorrow.  When I say small there were only 2 yes I  said 2 slices of avocado and the very bare minimum of chicken. 
The reason I'm writing this review is because I just remembered while there, there was a lady at the bar complaining about her chicken portion was smaller than normal and the bartender took it back. Not sure if there is someone new in the kitchen and if there is,  they need more training. 
I won't discredit for  service or quality of food but this order fell short for cheesecake factory standards."}
{"text":"The Louisiana Chicken pasta was a flavorless under cooked pasta dish.
The so called sauce was flavorless water. Not thick at all to be classified as sauce. The pasta was still hard. The Caesar salad was barely flavorful with grilled chicken breast that was dry. This $17 salad consisted of what looked like a mix of iceberg lettuce with a litte romaine lettuce tosses in. It was cut into small pieces to look like more I guess. However so small it was hard to grab with a fork. Smh. They Dynamite shrimp sauce was really good but they give you a very small portion of shrimp in my opinion. The bread they serve as you wait for your food was fresh , plentiful and really good!! Used some of the bread to help scoop out my small salad. Lol. The second star is only given due to the fact their waiter Cody did a really good job proving service. Otherwise it would be a 1 star. #CanIgetAnOrderOfBreadToGoPlz"}
{"text":"Delicious! The menu is pretty overwhelming with so many choices so I wonder how good all their food actually tastes. Aside from that our food we had was incredibly delicious! I ordered the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad with Kale and other ingredients. Huge portions and very tasty. My partner ordered Parmesan Cheese Chicken which was also very yummy. We then grabbed a slice of Key Lime Cheesecake takeaway and oh my that was the perfect balance of zesty, sweet goodness!"}
{"text":"I had an awful experience in November. I called the manager the following day and explained why we had a bad time, from the unorganized servers (multiple servers), to the repeating of everything we need (like water refill 3x), to the fact that the sever had a towel in his back pocket and rubbed across my pasta because he forgot to put in our appetizer salad so we got our pasta and salad at the same time I had pushed my pasta to the side and because the tables are way too close. Todd, the manager said he'd send us a gift card but that it would take some time because it comes from California then he'd mail it to me. So I waited and waited fast forward to January and I speak with Tracy, another manager allowing them to try to fix this one more time before I write a review and she was very friendly said she'd get back with me and she did, she let me know that the person in corporate doesn't work weekends (because I called on a Saturday) I was fine with that but here we are on Tuesday and still no word."}
{"text":"Great food and AWESOME cheesecake (I had the carrot cake cheesecake). Wait is super long (2.5 hours) but you can walk around the mall or go into moxies/pickle barrel for a drink or app while you wait!"}

We ordered an appetizer called Dynamite Shrimp it was sooooo good the sauce it came with was half part of the yummy factor! On to the bread they serve while you order, it was really good. For my actual lunch I ordered the Parmesan Chicken.. very tasty. I looked at the other items and found why order and burger and fries when I can get a dinner for three $$ more and take it home for lunch the next day! My Mommy in law got a noodle dish and she said it was delicious. We both had left over food to take home. So yes I'll be going there again..even just for that Dynamite Shrimp! I'm craving it now lol. Mmmm
Server was Mike, he was very good and checked on us plus bagged our food to go. Very nice gentleman he was!"}
{"text":"Great food and dessert obviously, but our waitress was horrible! Way too chatty, leaned over my food and beverage to deliver our check to the table before dessert even arrived!!"}
{"text":"I was eating solo this night and was starving when I was perusing the Caesars mall. I decided to go for a known quantity since I have known CF for years. I ate at the bar and had my usual soda and small chopped salad and bread. It came out to $15 bucks with tip. That's CHEAP by Vegas standards. The small salads are a good deal b/c CF gives you a huge amount of food in the main entrees and so these are just the right generous portion and most hotel rooms have no place to refrigerate or heat up your doggy bag anyways.

Bar staff was great. I think it was Tim that helped me. Always made sure to keep my glass filled. Kudos to him and he's cute to boot.

Verdict: Okay so CF is a chain that is everywhere nowadays, but it's nice to find someplace that is a known quantity, fed me in less than an hour, and isn't charging 50% more than their normal outlets and has a nice bar staff."}
{"text":"This place never fails my taste buds. There are so many delicious things to order off the pages and pages of menu. We started with the artichoke and it was scrumptious. Both of the dipping sauces were yummy and the artichoke was cooked perfectly. After we shared Evelyn's favorite pasta- it came with lots of veggies and good tasting sauce. We chose not to eat the cheesecake (this time), but it has always been amazing in the past. Our waiter was nice, but definitely a cheeseball. But hey, it provided a good laugh for us throughout dinner."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents on a super crowded Friday evening. We had to wait about 40 min, but decided to order a couple of drinks while we waited. Once we finally got seated, I decided to order the Chicken Madeira, which is their most popular dish. It was sooo good! It was a huge portion, but I somehow managed to finish it. I can see why everyone loves it! My dad ordered the Ahi and had to get them cook it more b/c it was practically raw and cold. It was probably supposed to be like that, but he didn't know what he was getting himself into. They took extra care in getting this done - both our waiter and the manager came over to make sure they were on the same page as my dad before cooking it more thoroughly. They also brought my dad a complimentary house salad while he waited. We decided to end our meals by all splitting a piece of their Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake. OMG. So good. Most importantly, we found that the service at this location was really good! Our waiter was funny, and rolled with the punches...nothing seemed to phase him."}
{"text":"Amazing! The speed of service, service, food quality and food temperature were all fantastic. Somewhat pricey but completely worth it."}
{"text":"I took my wife and two children out for dinner at this location on 09/26/17. 
The server was pleasant and attentive. The restaurant was immaculate in appearance as expected. 
The (MAJOR) problem was (unfortunately) the food. 
My wife ordered us the buffalo wings appetizer. 
When they arrived at our table the presentation was spot on, however, when we bit into the wings we were both disgusted by the fact that the wings were RAW on the inside. Now, let me be clear, when I say they were RAW; they weren't slightly undercooked, they were DRIPPING WITH BLOOD!!!
We immediately brought it to the attention of our server whom, by the way, was just as shocked and disgusted as we were. 
She was very apologetic and she politely gave us two options, order a different appetizer, or, she could put in a new order for freshly COOKED wings. 
We opted for the latter, as we assumed it was just an oversight by the preparer/cook.

Unfortunately, the second order was not very different from the first order. 

How hard is it to cook some wings???

The server was made aware of the fact that the the second set of wings were STILL undercooked. (An assessment that she, too, shared. 

She advised us that she would bring the matter to her managers attention. 

Ultimately, she removed the wings from our bill. 

I was surprised that the MOD (manager on duty) NEVER came over to our table to apologise to us.  There is NO DOUBT in my mind, that that is POOR MANAGEMENT.

Next issue: Both my wife and I each ordered a rib eye steak for our entree', BOTH COOKED MEDIUM TEMPERATURE. 

My Rib Eye steak arrived OVER COOKED. My wife's Rib Eye steak arrived cooked perfectly MEDIUM. 

There is nothing worse than people seated in the same party ordering identical meals, cooked the same way, served differently!! 

I WAS LEFT TO COVET MY WIFES STEAK, and we all know what the Bible says about coveting. 

To make matters worse, that night, I was sick ALL throughout the night! I was in the bathroom (like the famous song of Lionel Ritchie says) all night long. 

There is NO question in my mind that it was the bloody buffalo wings that made me sick. 

We have eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory on numerous occasions. This was the 1st time that the food made me SICK. 

I implore the kitchen manager, general manager, assistant managers, and food expediter(s) to PLEASE, MAKE SURE THAT FOOD IS COOKED PROPERLY. 

SERVING RAW CHICKEN CAN BE FATAL."}
{"text":"The packed parking lot speaks for Henderson locals who flock to this place well ahead of the dinner hour. We arrived at 5pm and still had to get on a waiting list for a table. The service, the menu and the atmosphere are top notch. My first visit because I thought it was a dessert place because of the name! Much more than could be anticipated and the appetizers, entrees and desserts were definitely a photo opportunity here."}
{"text":"This place used to be a 5 star dinner some few years back but not anymore. 

In one occasion, I went with my wife (she loves Cheesecake factory) and the waiter was very busy and seemed exhausted. We asked for two entrees and for myself I choose to try the chicken and shrimp entrée (it was new on the menu). When I unwrapped the napkin to get the fork and knife I noticed some sticky greenish stuff in between the teeth of my fork. My wife also noticed some sticky stuff on her knife. I knew it was not the waiters fault but called him and asked him to change the utensils. After some 20 minutes he came back with the utensils and the entrees followed. I looked at my dish and found it had no shrimp, only chicken and rice. I called him again and asked him \"Where is the shrimp?\". He looked at the dish then said \"the shrimp and the chicken are combined together\".... I took the knife and cut out one piece of chicken in to a half and asked him \"where is the shrimp now?\".

At this point I was very nervous and angry and asked him to call the manager. The manager came and he was a nice guy and insisted that he will change the dish and will not charge me for the entrees. I refused his offer and told him about the dirty utensils and that customers are not that dumb when the waiter says \"the chicken is mixed with the shrimp\". Took my wife and left to another place.

A year later, my wife asked me to go back. I did not want to but told my self \"things might have changed\". This time another waitress that can barely smile and busy as usual came after 15 minutes of being seated. We asked her for the bread and made our orders. The bread came after another 20 minutes and one of the plates was not what we ordered. Called her again and she apologized for the mistake. Another 15 minutes passed and the plate was served. Thus to start eating after being seated, it took 55-60 minutes!!!! I lost my appetite and asked her to pack the food, paid and left telling myself \"I am done with this place\".

I have been to many Cheesecake factory in different cities like Denver, Detroit, Charlotte, and Las Vegas. None of these is similar to the Ross Mall Cheesecake factory. If it was a scale from 1 to 5, these places I have mentioned are at 5 compered to this place which is at 1. Even the quality and portions are different, being better in the places I have mentioned.

Bottom-line, save your money and go find another decent place. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Ive never had a bad experience here. The staff is great.  They are always friendly and no matter how busy they are, they make sure to check on you frequently."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory. With an extensive menu, what's there not to love? I went there on a  Monday, 01/30/2017, in the early evening. I started off the evening with a bourbon and honey drink which came out in a martini glass; apart from the style of the glass, I was a fan of the drink itself.

For the entree, I had the chicken marsala and mushroom dish served over a bed of farfalle pasta. The flavors were all there, the smoothness of the butter and reduced alcohol with the broth all came together nicely. However, I was not a fan of the chicken texture itself. It seemed too... Soft. Almost as if the chicken wasn't entirely fresh, but not like it was spoiled or anything. Almost like the meat was cured or pounded or something, so it was softer in texture than would naturally occur. Maybe this is something that others enjoy, but I'm sort of not for it.

One of the things that has always struck odd in my mind is how extensive the menu is. When a menu is as many pages as it is at Cheesecake Factory, and offers so much in variety, it makes you wonder how fresh the ingredients actually are. Is it all frozen? If so, does it justify the high price point? These are questions that Yelpers should ask themselves when they go places. Fundamentally, are you REALLY getting your money's worth?

All in all, I had a good experience here. I may return, but the last time I set foot in a Cheesecake Factory before this was well before 2012.

BTW, to the best of my knowledge, Cheesecake Factory does not accept Apple Pay or Android Pay. However, they have their own app called CakePay that you can download from the app store or the Google Play store. With the app you can do mobile payments at any Cheesecake Factory establishments to the best of my knowledge. Business owners, if I am incorrect in this assessment, let me know and I'll make the required adjustments on my review."}
{"text":"This place was just what i have expected. 

The food was ok, for sure not worth the price that we have paid. I ordered a bowl of pasta that cost me $17.50. Just pasta with sun dried tomatoes. Too much. 

Service was just ok as well...They were semi-busy so the server was bouncing of the walls like he had 100 tables. 

I am not saying it is bad place to go to if you like heavy food that all tastes the same."}
{"text":"The front desk girl a few different times wasn't friendly at all.  The food is good but portions are small.  If it weren't for the hostess that never smiles I would rate more stars.  Hostess should be welcoming , accommodating and friendly.  For they are the first person you see when you enter.    Great fried zucchini though !!"}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory out in California (my home state) when I moved to Pitts I was super excited that there was a restaurant here . First time here as I'm waiting for my food it's been about 45 min not exaggerating they brought us the wrong plates apparently there was \"computer issue\" which we were not aware of so we have just been sitting here with no bread no food just starving in not one to complain but first and last time here I'll just wait until I go visit home to eat at cheesecake.  Notice my picture is empty! Still waiting on something to eat"}
{"text":"OMG the wait is fucking forever I can not deal with line ups, after line ups, after more line ups & more line ups!! My waitress is never there when I needed her. Thankfully my neighbour beside me spoke up and asked for the complimentary bread to be given to him. So I had to ask for it too. I ordered the Thai coconut-lime chicken. It was okay not the best food I've ate. Defiantly wished I ordered something else on the menu! At least my Dulce de leche Carmel cheesecake was amazing!"}
{"text":"Our server was Stella. I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare. We had avocado egg roll and fried calamari for our appetizers, which was very good! The egg roll was surprisingly very delicious. I got their newest (?) cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake. It was on the sweet side, so if that's what you're going for I'd give it a try.
Our server was more than happy to give us advice on our entrees. We came on a Friday during Valentines weekend for a friend's birthday. At first she forgot to sing happy birthday for our friend, but it worked out in the end. It was quite busy, but we got seated within 20-30 minutes. We had a party of 7, we sat in a 6 person booth and they added a seat to the end.  It took about 20 minutes for us to receive our main entrees. Thank you Stella for giving us great service ."}
{"text":"So delicious! The menu is huge with many many food options. I got the Bang bang chicken and shrimp and it was full of flavor. For desert I got the red velvet cheesecake and it was seriously one of the best slices of cheesecake I had ever had! Highly recommend that type of cheesecake here! Can't wait to go again and try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"\"Oh Ma, a Cheesecake factory gift card! You shouldn't have\" no, seriously. She really shouldn't have.

\"Nesto, take Helena out for a nice dinner\" Mom says beaming.

At the Cheesecake factory??! But I love her...

Cheesecake factory is ok.  For the record I am not a cheesecake fan, so that being said...

I took my mom out to lunch with the gift card, because she appreciated it, and Helena passed. LOL can't say that I really blame her.

The place has issues with identity...and size. Basically Cheesecake factory is a bisexual man with a small penis, metaphorically speaking.

I get the feeling that even their staff selection is based on this premise. All very nice folks, but somehow not decision makers in this world, so stuck in limbo. 

I had a Monte Cristo. It was very OK. My mom could make me better...hey there's an idea for next Christmas! Mom had the lettuce wraps and a gargantuan salad. 

I had Merlot, my mom had Gin and Tonic. 

It's a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and don't want to chance it on a better independant restaraunt--Although if you are on Yelp, there really is no excuse. We will steer you to a great restaurant.

 Other than that I can think of no real reason to frequent here. There are just too too many great restaurants that I want to try in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Never get tired of it. 

Portions are huge

Menu is enormous

Food tastes great

Service is always excellent

I cant ask for much more..."}
{"text":"Food is for the most part always good, but the service is not always good. Not sure if the restaurant doesn't employ enough waiters, but more often than not, the waiters r rushed n disappear 4 long periods of time. The waiter we had two days ago said he had 7 tables. Well, no wonder he couldn't come to our table very often. I go to a restaurant because I'm hungry n want to eat. I dont like waiting n waiting for a waiter repeatedly. The food here is also not cheap. CCF is fairly expensive."}
{"text":"The only reason why I give it a one star was because of the service we had. My food was great, but my friend had a different experience with her food. The waiter that served us wasn't really helpful or had good customer service. First off, I ordered water as my choice of drink, I wasn't given a straw to drink out of it and neither was my friend who ordered a water. My other two friends though who ordered a coke and tea were given straws. Don't know why, but that was weird, but I let it go. A friend of mine ordered a strawberry cheesecake. She got her cheesecake and halfway through her cheesecake she found a quarter in the whipped cream! At first, we thought that maybe it was a thing that the restaurant did, but it turns out it wasn't. Our waiter said he would \"talk\" to the bakery, but he didn't. He came back and gave us our bill. He didn't apologize for the mishap of the cheesecake, but yet he still charged her for the cheesecake! I advised my friend to speak with the manager, but she didn't want to make it a big deal. I respected her decision of course. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"Every time I come in the service is professional and the food is good. If you don't mind waiting sometimes this is a great place to go for any meal. One of the few places I can count on to be consistent."}
{"text":"We decided to wait a few months (I know!) before trying this new location which is constantly busy.
We waited 30 minutes to be seated on a Monday lunch. The decor is really beautiful and welcoming and the place it's bigger than I expected. We ordered the beef tacos and the tuna. Everything was fresh and tasteful. The tacos were seasoned to perfection! The service was fine, they had a new girl training who wanted to take the deserts order before we had our main course. The mango cheesecake is to die for!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about cheesecake factory before going there.it was my first time as I am not into sweet indulgence that much.we ordered nachos, garlic noodles, cheesecake factory special lemonade and tiramisu cheesecake. A lot I know.nachos was good.garlic noodles was awful. I don't know why they even call it garlic noodles. No hints of garlic. Lemonade was bad too.too much sweet.may b that's why they call it special.ughhhh.cheesecake was no doubt a good one...anyway I will go there only to have cheesecake, nothing else."}
{"text":"Friday night 9pm, just got in from Cali, the Bacon Bacon Burger is amazing! I had 2 slice of joy coupons and there was some flack from that, but there was no problem getting our free cheesecake. They ran out of Thousand Island dressing... I got the very last of it, just a smidgen. Service could have been better. When we asked to split the bill, it threw our server off. Ultimately everything worked in our favor. Beautiful decor. Bathroom is peraonal sized....only one stall, in which in a big restaurant like this, it should have a business sized bathroom."}
{"text":"Good food and the cheesecake is why you come here.  A little noisy but doable.  Service is good and wines are good as well.  Nice specialty drinks as, alcohol and non-alcohol.  Fun Atmosphere as you are in the forum shops. Had the flatbread and grandson had chicken strips.  Large menu selection."}
{"text":"Food very good :) always delicious!  Very disappointed with our waiter... waited forever for a straw... ordered lunch portion of a pasta and upon arrival to the table it's a full portion and then I'm told \"oh it doesn't come in lunch portion\". Extremely disappointed... could have split it with my sister had I known... not a big dig if you are going home soon... but not so much if hours of shopping ahead."}
{"text":"While the food was great, our server was less than caring about our 29th and our relatives 6th wedding anniversary!  The last 3 years previous to this, we had a wonderful waitress every year who made sure that the cheesecake had a little candle and happy anniversary written in chocolate or something like that.  This kid just verbalized it, that's it.  Now if it was a birthday, I'm sure there would have been a big deal made.... Guess what?  Achieving each year in marriage is way more of an accomplishment than aging.  I felt slighted and I think NEXT YEAR we will start a new tradition at a different restaurant!  Just because you get a different waitress does not mean your special day shouldn't be special.  Sorry but train your \"I've only been here for 3 month\" juvenile waiters to be compassionate.  Oh and nice how if you linger a little they start \"dropping hints\" .... Just a little compassion and patience would have gotten our server our normal 30% anniversary tip.  But he only got 20%."}
{"text":"Large menu, great food, fantastic service.  We'll be back~"}
{"text":"Staff is plentiful however service was extremely slow. It took over 30 minutes for our order to be taken, another 30 to get our appetizers. Our waters were empty for some time. The food was great and was just as it was expected, which is always good. It just seems that there should be more attention to tables when there were a minimum of 45 employees present."}
{"text":"OMG Calorie content of children meals!!

Check out the children meals before ordering, the calorie content is more than an average adult meal!"}
{"text":"Great as we last remembered. Try the guacamole as it can be added to any other dish you order. Had the leftovers on the Cubano sandwich. Michael was our server and he represents the level of service and quality of food that Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux offers. Always a must visit to both places when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant to dine at for special occasions. Amanda, my server was an absolute delight tonight. Today is my 23rd birthday,  recently moved, and ended a two year long relationship, I decided to take myself out for my birthday, to treat myself. Amanda was very kind, generous and allowed me to be comfortable. She didn't come up and ask me how I was doing every 6 minutes, which was very heart warming. I wanted a nice, quiet birthday dinner and she made it happen. She was very attentive, and extremely kind. At the end of my dinner she even brought me a birthday sundae, no birthday songs necessary. This was the absolute best birthday dinner ever.
I ordered the avocado egg rolls, the fried cauliflower, and a side salad. Along with a nice glass of red wine. Every plate was devine. Thank you for making my birthday one to remember! I will certainly be back in the future."}
{"text":"Open until midnight. Huge menu. International menu offerings. Large servings. Don't forget dessert!"}
{"text":"Was here for my sons birthday. Came with a party ordered apps, drinks, and meals... they don't even cover a birthday dessert... pretty disappointing..."}
{"text":"I love love love the vanilla bean cheesecake !! I usually but the small 7 inch I believe for $28 and enjoy it with my friends and family !!"}
{"text":"Boy, I went for lunch and had about my worst restaurant experience ever!!!
I've been in the biz in the past and go out of my way to be friendly as well as a solid 20 to 25 percent tipper. 

I won't go into all the details,but took 30 min to get my burger. Afterwards asked for mustard. That took another 10 minutes.

Sitting at the bar I mentioned to the bartender that it seemed a long time to wait.. he got angry with me and started accusing my of treating him like a servant. 
Which in fact employees of a restaurant are servants by definition..
It was so disturbing I paid, left no tip and more than half my food.
The manager was at the hostess station and I informed him of the treatment from the bartender. He seem not concerned..
I will never step foot in the restaurant again and will share my experience with many...
Bad bartender bad management..."}
{"text":"Dined in at this location for the first time for happy hour. Bartender was great at suggesting items without pushing them on you. It is setup nicely for solo dining or small groups. Service was fast and the food was good."}
{"text":"service was great. Ive been to multiple cheese cake factory restaurants but this one had the best service. We got fried calamari appetizer that was amazing.  Their pastas are pretty good too. This time I had the shrimp and chicken jambalaya which was  a little bit spicy but really good. Overall we had a great dinner. Oh and for desert the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was to die for."}
{"text":"For a theme / chain restaurant; this is one of the best!  Never had a bad meal and it's reasonably priced.  Of course you want to try the cheesecake. Good luck on deciding on what slice you want."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here at the bar counter while I was shopping and somebody said \"feed me.\"  Okay, that was my tummy and he didn't whisper either.   The service was very friendly and quick and the food was very good and as usual I had to get a doggie bag.   I can't really comment on the atmosphere inside since I was sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the food was great and the portions were really big! The bacon burger was juicy and very flavorful.  I will have it again."}
{"text":"Can believe how unprofessional the Manager is at this store.

First I'm a Vegas local. I normally eat at the summerlin location with wife and three kids, at least once a week. Never ever had any kind of problem.
 But on this occasion, I had friends in town visiting. We spent the day shopping at the down town outlet mall. Laughing, smiling, and just enjoying what started out to be such a great day. it till we went in to the cheesecake factory downtown. Once we walked in my Wife put our names down. It did take some time before we had gotten sat. There were six of us. An hour we waited. everyone was getting a little Hangry. My Wife approached the hostess and asked if were to be seated soon. The young lady said we were looking for you. She asked if we had left. Uh, NO we were sitting right next to your podium. Well another young lady came right over and call our name and sat us. 
To speed up  my story, The Sever was great. bread came to the table. We placed our drink order. And i order my go to dish Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Oh how i love this. Well when all the food came. I tasted my dish. AND BOOM  it tasted as the chicken was spoiled. I called the sever over and asked if she could smell it. She looked at the dish a said she was going to get her Manager. I replied there no need for that. Just bring my another. 
A few minutes later a Gentleman approached our table and identify him self as the GM Danny. I assumed he was going to speak to me about my Favorite dish, My Go to. But no. Danny emphasized in a very strong tone that he didn't appreciate on how my wife had spoken to the hostess. And if there is a problem with the food. Go some where else.

Well, I asked for my Bill. at the shock my group and i were in. I just couldn't say anything, But never again, never again. But WOW

Save your self any kind of Drama. Drive to a different Cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"Suggested Cheesecake Factory for a birthday dinner meetup with family from out of town.  We've been coming to CF for years, all over the country for several reasons.  One, variety of the menu.  Two, consistency.  Three, convenience.  You don't go to CF for its uniqueness or specialty menu, you go because you know exactly what you (should) be getting . . . This local CF failed at 2 out of 3 tonight. 

Convenience: 30-45 minute wait at 5:50 pm on Sunday that was every bit of 45 minutes, yet plenty of open tables in our section.  Understaffed perhaps.  Followed by excessively slow service.  Forgotten items (missed an app and a side), too long to take orders, too long to bus the table, if at all mid service.  Water refills nonexistent.  This is restaurant 101 stuff.

Consistency: failed here too.  Steak undercooked and cold (credit where due, at least it wasn't overcooked), menu items I've had elsewhere simply not the same (a cardinal sin of the dreaded chain restaurant), and in one case the dish was served with a significantly different setup than described on the menu.  All prepared with minimal adequacy.  It was edible but nothing remarkable or even good by CF standards.

Saw another table leave in frustration after walking up to the service station for a drink refill for the same reasons: slow, incompetent service.

I guess what this Cheesecake Factory has going for it is an anchor location in the local high end mall and a captured audience.  They simply do not need to perform at restaurant fundamentals to continue as a business, people will still fill the place up.  Which is a shame, because CFs can be quite good, when they're not failing at basic functions.

Do yourselves a favor and walk over to many of the other almost as close options so this store can just end it already and give up the space to someone who will execute as if they care about their customers."}
{"text":"Reminds me of home *sigh* they should use the slogan from Olive garden here because when I'm hear I feel like family. . . 

It's like the family that when you see it you're really happy to see them, especially when they're less than $50 ;) 

So if you're a homebody like me and can't afford to live the Vegas lifestyle of seafood and overpriced steak then head to where the home is, Cheesecake Factory.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"My wife had the Chicken Madeira, and I had the Shrimp Scampi, totally awesome.  However, our server, Cynthia, was the greatest.  Thank you Cynthia for providing an excellent dinning experience."}
{"text":"Great choices, reasonably priced for the Strip. Food came out fast despite the packed house. We had a great waiter too!   I wanted to order \"the Leonard\" but it wasn't a menu option."}
{"text":"I always love eating here. It is a little overpriced but I've never gotten any food I didn't like or bad service. I'm partial to the chicken alfredo. Cheesecake Factory makes it the best. I usually bring my parents here when they come to visit from the State College area, where there is no Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"There really isn't much to say about a place like The Cheesecake Factory. It's chainey, has huge portions.... This particular location feels too large, like I felt like I was getting lost in my booth b/c the place was so large. 

The food was on par with what I have come to expect from this chain, but it was the service that warrants the deduction in stars. Throughout our experience the service was fine- not particularly good, not particularly bad- but that all changed as we were getting ready to leave. 

I had asked for a box (b/c the portions are just too large here) and was in the process of placing my leftovers into said box when the waitress came back after running our credit card. As I still had my hand on my plate, picking at the last few fries that did not fit in the box, she swopped in and took the plate from me. Really???? This took a middle of the road experience and turned it sour."}
{"text":"Typical of chain restaurants these days. Only ate here because we had a gift card. We like to try and keep our business local instead of supporting big corporations. Food was mediocre and cold when it came out. The Bang, bang chicken and shrimp didn't have any bang at all. My wife had greasy fish and chips with cold french fries and didn't want finish it. On the positive side, the drinks and service were good and the manager did come by to tell us our food was going to be out in a few. Didn't want to wait again after the cold food was served."}
{"text":"At this time, the line ups are still pretty long. They gave us pagers so we can walk around the mall without wasting our time in line. We walking around the mall with our pagers for about 3 hours. When we finally got served, the staff was very friendly for such an over crowded and hyped up place. They were all patient with us. It was my friends birthday so they sang my friend happy birthday and gave her cheesecake with happy birthday written on her plate. I ordered carbonara and shares it with my friend as well as cheesecake. The carbonara was super delicious and just the right amount of sause. The cheesecale was super delicious as well. I ordered the celebration cheesecake even though it wasn't my birthday. The celebration cheesecake was super cute and colourful. The cheesecake wasn't super sweet but just the right amount. My other friend for the tirmasu cheesecake and it was very fluffy and flavorful."}
{"text":"I know, I know...shame on me for eating at a chain restaurant...BUT, I like the options that they have on the menu and I generally like the quality of the food and flavor, plus the portions are large.

It was fairly busy when we arrived.  We had to wait maybe 8 minutes for a table, so in the mean time we went to the bar and ordered a drink.  Gin and tonic with lime for me, fat tire for the fiance.  Nothing fancy, nothing to get hyped up about.

We were seated in an odd little corner in the back of the restaurant.  It was cozy with the exception of the loud and annoying kid sitting next to me, who clearly had a mild (or extreme) form of ADD.  The parents were doing nothing to prevent the kid from going crazy...but, this forum is not for talk on parenting, so all things aside, let's talk about the food.

Our waiter was AWESOME!  His name was Mathew, early 20's (if that), skinny and frail, but overall a bright burst of energy and enthusiasm about his job and serving us.  WAY TO GO.  He had a cute goofy laugh and made the special sound tasty, though it was not what I came to eat.

He was prompt to deliver us our water, bread, and come back to take our order.  My fiance ordered the farmhouse burger (burger, pork belly, egg, all the fixins) and I had the farfalle garlic chicken pasta (which came with peas, cream sauce, garlic, tomato, shrooms, etc.).  

When the food finally did arrive, I was greeted with something that clearly was NOT my order.  It was a pasta dish, except it had shrimp and spaghetti, instead of bowtie pasta and chicken.  I kindly told the girl this wasn't what I ordered and she graciously brought me back the correct item.  Apparently, she got them mixed up.

I ate only two bites before I realized that almost half of the ingredients were missing from my dish.  Mathew came back, I advised him of the issue, and he HAPPILY took the plate back.  I was expecting to see the same food I just snacked on with a splash of peas added.  WRONG.  He brought me back a whole BRAND NEW dish!  Fresher tasting than the last!  Exciting!  He made sure to hook me up on the extra parm cheese too!

In either case, I gave this experience 4 stars.  I know that there were some issues that took place, but the way that it was handled and amended really stood out in my mind as excellent.  I genuinely have great experiences when I come here."}
{"text":"Food has gone from fair to bad,really bad. Got an omelette that had burnt bacon on top of it,plus very little edible bacon inside. Pathetic."}
{"text":"For the most part, Cheesecake Factory has done pretty well 99% of the time when I come here. Well, this is the 1% time that I think it was actually bad. 

We waited 10 minutes before anybody came to greet us at the table. 

It then took her 15 minutes to go get water. 

It then took 25 minutes for the food to get to us. We ordered salad and noodles, not steak.

You rang our bill up. THEN started spewing on about the new desserts on the menu.... uh... hello?

Need I say more?! 

I apologize for the 10% tip \"Missy\" (our waitress), but you're lucky you got a tip at all. And NO, saying my 8 month old is cute half way through my meal does not make up for the crappy service you just dished out.

I will be back here since Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to dine, but this time it was just a total miss!"}
{"text":"Huge menu with lots of options.  Chinese chicken salad is very big but it's phenomenal.  The patio makes for great outdoor dining.  Consistent food and always great service here."}
{"text":"Food is good. Lemonade is delicious! Grilled salmon is my favorite! We love this place. The wait for a table sucks! Seating outside in the summer is always is nice too. Good place for the family."}
{"text":"my husband and I came to Cheesecake Factory at Superstition Springs in April 2016 and the waitress did not give us a soup choice and brought a terrible Mexican style soup and the sandwich my husband ordered (chicken) tasted like canned chicken... terrible.  The waitress seemed to be friendly but was NOT paying attention to my request for gluten free food... my salad came to the table with lots of croutons (had to take them all off) and seems to be afraid we might complain and just left us alone even though we smiled at her and gave her approval as she was friendly...   we are (after 4 visits) feeling we have done all we can to achieve a good result for meals at CCF !"}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday dinner and it was pretty good. The food was good ( I had a Navajo sandwich which was on indian fry bread...yum!) but the kicker was our waitress. She was awesome. She was so nice and made sure we had everything we needed but wasn't obnoxious and coming to our table every 5 seconds. She was the perfect waitress. And, because we told her late that it was my brother's birthday, he got a free piece of cheesecake instead of the usual sundae. Yea Heidi!"}
{"text":"I Saw Cheesecake Factory In Hawaii And It Is My First Time Seeing It In Canada At Yorkdale Mall And The Food And The Dessert Is Great And The Service Is Great. ! ?"}
{"text":"Have been here plenty of times but that was before smart phones and Yelp. I've always enjoyed the food and especially the desserts. 

This time around i\"m with my wife and 4 year old son. After we ordered our drinks we received our complimentary bread. Our server brought out my son his own small bread plate with sliced bananas. Thought that was excellent, never seen that before!

We both had separate chicken dishes. They wete ordered and in no time, on a Friday night they were at our table. I'd say they were faster than Jimmy John's. We split with our son and he gobbled it all up. She had the chicken picata an I had the chicken marsala. Both were fantastic. 

Now time for dessert. Cheesecake Factory is famous for what? Their Cheesecake!!! Oh my, decision, decision, decision! There is just so much how can 1 person plus a 4 yeat old decide? Seems I'm sharing with my son so he'll decide. 

So it's decided, the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. The cake was enormous so we split it amongst us. The only thing i didn't really care for was the whipped cream. It had a blan taste but overall it was fantastic. 

Our server was great. He was busy however he went above my expectations. Food was great and served quickly. Our drinks were refreshed even when we didn't ask. 

I think 1 thing they could improve on is the lighting. We sat in a part of the restaurant that the overhead lights were high in the ceiling which made it hard to read the menu. 

Overall we're beyond satisfied. Especially when we were visited by a cricket"}
{"text":"First time eating here for me. 6:30 pm on sat night and parking lot is packed yet we only waited 25 min for table. It is beautiful inside with stone columns and masonary walls and ceilings , but these surfaces make for a noisier than average room. More items on the menu than I have ever seen, found at least 7-8 meals i wanted to try though. I settled on the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and my wife the Chicken Bellagio. Warm bread came out first was very good and our meals arrived about 20 minutes later. I started on mine before I realized it was not what I ordered. I confirmed thus with the waiter and he offered to get me what I ordered but I really liked those first few bites and decided to keep it(Louisiana Chicken Pasta). It was easily the best dish I've had in years anywhere. My wife loved her meal as well. We ordered cheesecake to go and enjoyed it later that night. The entrees were priced fairly but lemonade was 5$ and cheesecake was 7.95 per slice which was on high side for me . Waiter was friendly but could've been more attentive. In spite of few negatives ultimately I want good food and everything I had this night was delicious and full of flavor. Hope to return soon just wish it was closer than an hour away."}
{"text":"I met my girlfriends here to kick off ladies night last Friday. I am not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, it's not that it's bad - I just prefer to try restaurants that are not necessarily chain style restaurants - especially when it comes to dinner style dates. However, my friends picked the spot and I obliged. I ordered a lemon drop martini and a cucumber mule for cocktails. For dinner, I ordered the alfredo but asked them to add blackened shrimp for some added flavor. The shrimp were on the smaller end and were slightly over cooked. The taste of the rich, creamy alfredo made up for it but it set pretty heavy in the belly. So much so, that I ended up passing on cheesecake. I think I would order off the small plate menu next time and leave room for all the yummy desserts. I had a pretty busy day so I was starving when the food came out - sorry, no pics of the food - just part of the menu."}
{"text":"I don't usually give bad reviews but I'm giving this place one star for the horrible wait times, lack of friendly service and overall how slow everything is from the time you get seated to the time that you leave. 

We were given a buzzer and told it would be a two hour wait for a party of 6. As we agreed to be put on the wait list, we walked around the mall to kill time. Coming back at almost two hours we went back to the desk to inquire about how long it would take still only to be told we were not on the list. If we didn't ask, we would be waiting for who knows how long. The buzzer we were given was for a party of two and this whole confusion caused us to wait even longer. We would have left altogether if it weren't for being with seniors and already waiting two hours. 

it seemed like we were the ones being blamed when we did what the hostess asked and provided both our names and phone number. After about twenty minutes of continuously looking for our nonexistent names on the list, the situation finally resolved and we finally seated and were able to order. Sadly one of the pasta dishes we wanted to order was not available, so we were told this a while after which prolonged eating time even more, and obviously not a pleasant thing to hear after what had already happened. Our server was friendly, however, the overall experience was not a positive one as we were constantly waiting and had to wait another thirty minutes after paying the bill for the cheesecakes we had ordered to go. 

Honestly, save your time and go elsewhere, the wait times and extremely slow service are not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've always been hoping to come here but the nearest Cheesecake Factory is pretty far from me, so you can image my delight that I found one while on vacation in Las Vegas. I glad to say I was not disappointed. The drinks are delicious and the dessert was perfect and what can I say about the meal itself,,, it was just what I was hoping for and more. I look forward to being able to visit again."}
{"text":"I love their cheese cake , ..to death. Most of what I have tried from the menu is very good as well, even tho it is a chain, certainly give it a try."}
{"text":"This place has great service and the pasta de vincci was delicious!  Oh and should I mention the banana cheesecake?  That was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant for family get togethers and is a favorite of my Dad's side. Their portions are meant more for two or three people than just one, so if you're open to splitting, this is the place to go. Their salads are always fresh and tasty and their pasta dishes are amazing. Pretty much anything that you order here is great. My husband and I always leave with that warm, satisfied glow and feeling comfortably full. There's no greasy, yucky aftertaste like a lot of places.

Our favorites include the crab puffs, the asian chicken salad, their burgers and their penne spaghetti. They have a meal for just about any taste or craving and have the most enticing deserts! We had a raspberry-white chocolate cheesecake that was absolutely to die for! They have awesome rye bread, which you get for free before your meal to nibble on.

The service is usually pretty good and we never really have any complaints. The staff are always friendly and helpful and always have positive things to say about the food we're ordering. They'll even go so far as to inform us of tasty new menu choices. Trust me...eat a meal here and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food, the atmosphere and the service.  My only compaint is this place can be expensive.  I don't remember the name of the dish I got last time, but it was some chicken over angel hair with garlic cream sauce and it was fabulous.  I also really like the Nachos so anyone who isn't into pasta can order some things for them too.  Although I have never had one myself because I was too full, others I have been with have gotten several different cakes and they all look amazing.  So if you are a fan of cheesecake, I would definetly suggest trying a piece."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the Cheesecake Factory the other day and were pleasantly surprised.  The menu offered a huge selection of food including a separate menu of just calorie conscious meals.  They also had a full bar, which was a nice surprise as well.

We were greeted at the door by a gal that ended up being our waitress.  She was great and upon hearing that we'd never been there before, she went through the menu, which is more like a book, and gave us a brief summary of what was available and where to find it.

I ordered the Chop Salad off of the low calorie menu and also a low cal mojito.  The mojito was delicious, but also cost $9.50, not sure it was worth that.  The Chop Salad wasn't bad, but not something I'd go back for.  My husband's meal was about the same, average.

The seating was nice, waitress was great, menu was huge, and the meal was average. All in all, it's not bad."}
{"text":"Love so much of their food here it's honestly too much to type all my favs. Never had a bad experience here the service is great. Love all their food and desert items. Also good choices of alcohol. So yummy."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory probably 200 times over the last 15 years or so, between 3 dif states.  I used to always love it.  In Vegas, I've been to this Summerlin location at least 20 times and usually my chances of quality customer service are 50/50 (between the hosts and servers) so I would normally give the place only 3 stars BUT tonight I experienced the best customer service I've ever had at this location, mostly due to our server Daniel O.  The restaurant was busy and he had multiple tables but he was very attentive to each of them including us. Constantly walking by to check on any needs we may have, picking up extra bread plates etc that we were done with, quickly, providing drink refills before we could even request them etc.  Honestly, he is the only server I've ever had at this location that didn't disappear at some point.  Also, he was very friendly and provided helpful suggestions to all of his customers re food options, adding sauce to a dish etc. Overall, the food was solid as usual, but Daniel O. was the one who really made our dining experience. I hope next time we go there, he is working so we can request him."}
{"text":"Birthday luncheon for party of 6. We waited 15mins. 

We have balloons with *happy birthday* printed on them. Our server asked what we're celebrating, and who's the lucky one.

Our server neglected to provide us flatwares. We had to flag her several times to place our orders, refills, and for a complimentary sweet treat for the birthday celebrant.

The food was pricey with the portions we were given.
The food was also room temperature by the time we received it. 

And no complimentary birthday sweet treat. 

Never returning to this restaurant again. Ever!
Over priced, and lack-luster service."}
{"text":"This place is a classic. You can literally order anything from their menu, (which mind you is HUGE, and has a little bit of everything) and be satisfied. So many great appetizers, and a good drinks as well. All in all just a great atmosphere and food, it's a perfect place to take the whole family."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu! They have something for everyone, including this picky vegetarian! Today I had the veggie burger which I think is really good...the special mayo makes it even tastier so don't let them forget to give it to you if they forget. The California Guacamole Salad is really yummy at this location (I tried it as the East Mesa location and it just didn't taste the same). My dad says this is the must go place for the battered fish tacos, he thinks they are the best he has tried in AZ.  They have a crazy variety of cheesecakes if you can even eat after eating your meal...you can always get a cheesecake to go because their cheesecake is really good! The service was amazing today....the manager (blonde lady-sorry I didn't get your name)....this place is super busy yet she took the time to pick up our plates and great us as we left. It's a pretty big restaurant so don't let it scare you away when I say it's busy...It's a must try if you haven't ever tried the Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"I had skinny turkey and avocado sandwich. Small portion was perfect came with some salad greens. I had ice tea with lemon to drink. The waitress kept my drink full. For dessert I had the mango keylime cheese cake. Highly recommend that flavor. So yummy. We had a very good experience and service was good. All and all everything was above average. Total bill for three dessert, drinks, one skinny sandwich was just over $60. We will come again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and drank a green iced tea that I couldn't get enough of. Sat at the bar with Jennifer who was just the sweetest thing ever. I had tuna tartar and a salad, it's in the triple digits outside so thank you for having the ac cranked up. I haven't had  cheese cake in a while but know they are awesome , wouldn't mind one now."}
{"text":"Bruh y'all slow as ever my girl food was cold as hell. The service was beyond weak. I ordered my food went out to the mall and came back and my food still wasn't here. My girl noodles looked like a damn mop head. I can't even deal dude. Oh and my friend found a silverback gorilla hair in her food. The nerve of you people. Never again"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times with great meals & service so I was anticipating more of the same along with fun date-time with hubby.
Unfortunately this was not to be. I had ordered the eggplant  parmigiana  along w side of pasta (substituted marinara for pesto).  Eggplant parmigiana was so very disappointing; thick, overcooked hockey puck-like slices & the angel hair pasta had no sauce. There was no flavor whatsoever in small amount of sauce there was so I sent it back & ordered Chinese Chicken Salad which arrived with no dressing at which time I asked to have it packed up to go along w some dressing.  Hubby's Lettuce Wraps were great though."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, I absolutely have to come here!  My experience here has always been enjoyable. Cheesescake Factory has an all time favorite dish of mine... The Bang Bang-Chicken and Shrimp(AyMayZinG!!) The combination of Coconut Curry with Chicken and Shrimp over a bed of rice... delicious! I have had my share of curry dishes, but none beat this one(pretty much the only reason I come here). Oh..and the Thai Wraps get a well deserved Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"I love this place and my hubs and I always have a good time. Unfortunately, the host working tonight (darker one with dark hair and glasses) was so unbelievably rude, we almost decided to leave. We walked up to the booth and got no greeting. No \"hello, hi, what's up\". Nothing. Instead we got no eye contact, a \"how many\" and \"okay. 20 minutes\". We ended up waiting 40. The food is worth it and our waitress Terrie was so sweet and very attentive. She's the reason I'll give the extra star tonight."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Walked in on Sunday afternoon around 1 waited less than 10 minuets to be seated restaurant was packed. One recommendation roll down sun shades on south side patio took a beating."}
{"text":"Bad service and found a hair in my calimari. We won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"the Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat, and now there is a closer location to the house. The service has always been good, food portions are good. a must place to eat. Did i Mention the Strawberry Lemonade.. it so soso sweet and good."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! Traveling from Florida. We had a great experience here at the Lyndhurst, OH location with our server Dan!"}
{"text":"The experience wasn't at all too bad, but it wasn't great either.  We had about an hour wait, which is expected for Cheesecake Factory.  

The FRIED MAC AND CHEESE IS TO DIE FOR, which is expected and normal.  The shrimp franchese pasta is deliciouss too; however, I had them add in the veggies from Evelyn's Favorite Pasta.  Skip the small plate side salad.  It's nothing special or delicious.  

The service was a little on the disappointing side.  The main courses came out before the appetizers and one of my friends didn't even get her food.  We waited 20 minutes before she even got her sandwich, if anything she should have gotten it first before our food.  I know its the not fault of the waiter, but the kitchens.  However, it took us 15 minutes to get the attention of the waiter.  The waiter was slow to get our drinks and refills as well.  

The restaurant got 3 stars only because of the pasta and fried mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Typically coming to The Cheesecake Factory means a 10-15 minute wait on weekends. To my surprise I was seated immediately! The portions here are HUGE, so typically I only order an appetizer, which today's choice was the fried mac 'n cheese. Service was a little on the slow side, but they made up for it in the end."}
{"text":"Completely impressed with our waiter.  I asked what seasonings were in the Chicken Samosas and he knew without skipping a beat, which deserves 3 stars in itself.  I got the Samosas (on the app menu) and my husband opted for a basic burger and fries.  I had iced tea and my husband ordered a green tea which was A-MAZING.  I wished I had ordered that and I hope I remember next time.  It came with a sprig of fresh mint and was just the perfect flavor.

The samosas were wonderful and came with a really yummy cilantro sauce for dipping.  I could have used some more sauce though. (Not that they were skimpy with it, just that I like a good dipping sauce LOL).  My husband liked his burger, it was nothing special but he was just in the mood for a basic burger so he was happy.  The fries were just ok.

Service was quick and very competent. We'll be back when we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine in?White chocolate raspberry truffle is the best ever!"}
{"text":"I went by myself after a long day of shopping ...  Service was excellent.  Dana was my server so friendly and cheerful and took time to ask about my day.  Good music playing.  I had Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls and the bistro shrimp pasta.  Both VERY yummy.  I had the lemon cello torte for dessert... Oh my lil slice of heaven.  I'll be back thanks Cheesecake Factory for great first experience!"}
{"text":"I thought it was great! Had the red velvet cheese cake and the macaroni cheeseburger which came to a total of $21 which I expected. The staff was extremely friendly. I got my order \"to go\" because it was so crowded."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants but such an honest disappointment. My friend and I had gone to Cheesecake Factory last evening and had a horrible experience. 
- I used to be a receptionist for 5 years. I understand how frustrating it might be to have an overcrowding number of people by the front desk checking in.. With that being said, I had always given the clients/customers a friendly smile, an assurance on their wait until being served, and most importantly, TO MAKE SURE I WAS POLITE TO THE CUSTOMERS (even if I was going crazy inside my head, I had to make sure they would have a pleasant experience, so they would come back). Oh my goodness! Yesterday was a disaster! I arrived around 6:45 PM, I checked in the front, AFTER she asked \"next person in line?\" I had asked for a wait of two people.. (The woman at the front desk, was older, around her 50's, glasses and short hair.. accompanied by a male, in his 30's..) She completely IGNORED me, and asked the next person in line. Once the woman behind me had gone up to the desk, the hostess then had the nerve to ask me who was first in line.. Are you serious? You had asked me to come forward to help me, completely ignore me, ask another customer to approach up front, then ask who was first? Before either of us had the chance to speak, she quickly looked at the other woman and asked her if she was first.. Of course the woman said she was..?
Shocked and disappointed, I waited until she was done helping the other woman. When she was done, I had told her I had been at the front desk first, before the other woman.. She replied, \"The wait for two people is about 40 minutes NOW.\" (The reason why I put caps on \"now\" was because of the way she said it. She gave me attitude at the end.. I'm sorry.. but that is not how you treat customers. Honest. I had never received such a horrible experience. 
...Continuing on with my experience...
I said, \"Okay\", we were handed a pager..
1 HOUR AND 25 MINUTES LATER.. We were finally seated. The one thing I dont understand is that other parties of two who checked in AFTER US had been seated first. I was not the only one who was utterly angry, but another couple was also very disappointed, they had waited with us 5 minutes after we were checked in.. I know they dont have \"call ahead's\" on weekends due to how vastly busy they are but they seemed to get a lot of other people in front of us.. odd much? 

After being seated, a server came, asked us for drinks/appetizers.. 
we ordered their spinach dip, which came out very watery.. 
my friend and I also had pasta, which was disappointingly undercooked..

Again, I repeat myself.. Horrible experience.. Even though I am a Cheesecake Factory fan, it's highly doubtful that I'll come back.. Believe all the raving bad views because it's absolutely true.. Please save your money and go to Brio across the way.. AT LEAST they'll treat you 10x better than they do at Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Still love the cheesecake here though the prices seem to get higher as the portions get smaller service was excellent the wait staff could've done more suggestive selling and there was a lack of excitement it felt very commercial. Food was good and was timely drinks were never empty and left with a belly full"}
{"text":"While it was super busy, Kelsey and I walked in and were seated right away. We started with the bread and butter (we both love the brown bread) followed by the Mac & Cheese appetizer. It's huge! It comes with four pieces total. Very good! I had the Farfalle chicken pasta with garlic. I've had this dish before and today it was just okay. Overall we have a great lunch."}
{"text":"Jessica was the best waitress we have had in a long time. The food was great and she sent me with a loaf of bread to go. Bonus! The wait for a booth on a Saturday night was long, one hour, but with it."}
{"text":"The cheesecakes are good and the setting is kind of fancy smancy, but that is all. Everything went downhill from that point. The Cheesecake Factory just intensifies my dislike for restaurant chains. 

 Now, let me whine, cry and complain. It's way too dark in there, how the heck am I supposed to read the menu? Are there sketchy stuff in the food that you guys don't want me to see? Also, it took nearly an hour for my food to arrive. My eating companions literally left the restaurant to walk around and when they came back, I'm still there nibbling on bread and butter. The frustrating part is that the restaurant was not even that busy. I got to try the avocado eggrolls, which were so bland. The Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish, which was just a super sweet curry dish. It looks kind of gross, but tastes ok. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was not even spicy at all, but was actually the most edible dish on the table. 

 Overall, the long wait really turned me off and the food was not that impressive. I recommend this place for the tasty cheesecakes, and ONLY the tasty cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly servers, nicely priced, awesome cheesecake, and if you get to sit outside you get a nice view of the hotel's aquarium. You definitely should stop by. :)"}
{"text":"We use to go there a lot but they started slipping.
We tried it again today for brunch. I ordered a Skinnylicious Turkey Avocado Sandwich and it was bland and small. The salad was spinach leaves with a little dressing. Had to wait while they brewed us decalf. My wife ordered some slimy spring rolls and a salad which had too many Cucumbers. The bill with 20% tip was like $43 bucks!!! 
Hate to give up on these guys because we use to have good meals there."}
{"text":"The servers here are very nice. They treat me good everytime I come in!

As far as the food goes, it is hit and miss. In the past I have ordered fried fish, pasta and wings and they were disgusting. More recently, I have ordered the appetizer burger sliders, artichoke and spinach dip, and kale and quinoa salad. They were DELICIOUS! They're menu is so large that you sometimes don't know what to order! May the odds ever be in your favor.

Cheesecakes are great! My favorite slices are oreo cheesecake and red velvet. YUM!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  I called in a curbside order was placed on hold for 6 min before I decided to hang up & try again this time I didn't let her put me on hold & explained I had already held long enough.  She promptly got someone to take my order, a lunch Sante Fe salad.  That's it nothing more.  I arrived 20 min later, they gave me a 15 min window, I felt that was ample time.  I get there & curbside parking is obviously not being observed, it never is.  So I call & say I'm just parked up front not in those spots, as they are taken.  I waited 10 min no one came out.  I found a place to park & went in.  The gentleman running out the door had my food & said he was the only one working and he was very sorry.  I am very sorry that I aw at least 3 others standing around.  There was gentleman right by the bakery, yet no one could help him get out of the weeds?  I'm sorry for him trying to do his best while his manager & co workers watched him literally run around to try & attend to his afternoon lunch orders.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"The food at Cheesecake is good. This review is mostly for the service. It Was So SLOW!!!!  It was extremely slow. We had to wait for everything; bread, drinks, entrees, bill... it was ridiculous. We almost left before we got our entrees."}
{"text":"Hubby had a gift card for this place, so we came back here to eat during our visit to Vegas.
Our server, David F was very nice. I've seen him before from our visits to this restaurant and he told us he's worked there about 12 yrs.  
We had:
1. fried calamari, $11.95. Not as good as I remembered. Wouldn't order again
2. Orange chicken, $16.95. Didn't taste that good. Hubby ordered it and said the orange chicken was better at Panda Express.
3. Skinny Caesar Salad, $9.95. I seemed to remember it was better before. No anchovies.
4. Coffee $3
5. Fresh Strawberry cheesecake, $7.95.  It was Ok. 
I hope we don't get anymore gift cards for this place. I think the food has gone downhill."}
{"text":"If you ask me about the taste of the food, I'd give it a 5 stars. If you ask me about the service, it's either a hit or miss. I hate how there is ALWAYS a wait, which definitely deters me from going there. Also, they have no WiFi which is fine but also don't have cell service."}
{"text":"Best cheesecakes ever! I still have a few on my list and I would have tried them all. My favorites are the banana cheesecake and the strawberry cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"As someone who has been frequenting the cheesecake factory for years, I was ecstatic when they opened it so close to me.

My first experience was takeout, and I got my favourite Louisiana chicken pasta, plus the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake . The pasta was just like the states, so I was very happy. However, I also ordered the avocado egg rolls, and it wasn't in my bag when I came home. I emailed the cheesecake factory as advised on the phone, and this issue still hasn't been resolved and it's been a few weeks. I find that to be very poor customer service, especially for a new restaurant. 

I went back with my gfs last Friday to dine in for our annual secret Santa dinner. We enjoyed their wine, and also got a second bottle. The apps were very delicious, and highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls. We also got the buffalo blasts, which were good, but huge! I ordered the chicken parm pizza and my gf ordered the jambalaya pasta. It was insanely salty. I hate sending food back, but my gf also was not able to eat it. We sent it back, and then got our food with less salt, but then it tasted absolutely bland for both of us. Our gfs were pretty much done eating so, we just ate two bites and asked to pack it up. We felt bad to send it back again but we both just didn't want to eat anymore. Our server Amanda was really nice and apologetic. 

We each ordered cheesecake, and found that enjoyable. I liked my red velvet cheesecake very much. 

I would say 2.5 stars, as the service was great, as were the apps and dessert. But for my outstanding takeout issue and the taste of our mains, I deducted some huge points.


*I updated this to 3 stars because they sent me an apology and a gift card for 25 dollars due to the issues I had."}
{"text":"Service was terrible waitress walked around table and never offered refills I had to literally ask her 3 times to get one. Got a dirty cup dried nasty food on it and she was rude about it and said ok so do you want another one or what? Took 30 mins to get check after I asked her for it. Will not be returning food wasn't even that good. Wish I could give it no stars at all!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for any meal! In the great town of Pittsburg PA. They have something for everyone! Always great service and atmosphere!  The cheesecake and all desserts are to die for!!! Love love love this place! So do my kids. Also kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent dessert of course ;) Great food, lots of choices! Never had a bad meal but service is sometimes slow. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is definitely not what it used to be. My my family and I visited last night, and were very disappointed with the experience. Bad food, okay service, and upset stomachs are guarantees that I will not be visiting the Cheesecake Factory again. 

It took forever to get drinks and bread. It was understandable as it was busy, and the server was pleasant enough. We then waited 30 minutes to order our food.

When our food finally arrived, it looked great, and we excitedly dug in. What we were met with was a greasy and flavorless mess. The cheeseburger tasted as if it had been deep-fried and not seasoned. The chicken was dry and flavorless, but also very greasy. We ordered the factory nachos and you could see the grease from the over fried tortilla chips pilling underneath the cheese. I have never seen nachos like these. Even the cheese was oily. 
 
I will say that the cheesecake was great, as usual. But, for a dessert that comes shipped in pre-made and frozen, and priced at about $10 a pop, it better be great.

One of the most upsetting things about this meal, was the way that the hostess/ bartender was dressed. Her cleavage was busting out of her shirt. Her short skirt had a slit in the back that went all the way to her butt, and you could see the outline of her panties. That coupled with pounds of makeup and 4 inch heels made her look like something you would see at a trashy bar or strip club, not at a restaurant where families go. Everybody was staring and I'm sure it made some feel uncomfortable. There should be a minimum standard dress at a restaurant like this.


We  are not ones to complain. It is very seldom that we  go out to eat and do not enjoy our food. But this meal was a disaster. Even with only eating half my meal, the grease settled hard in my stomach, and I left feeling queasy.

Maybe it was just a bad night at the Cheesecake Factory, but I would not recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Around a 2.5/5 overall.

Went back to The Cheesecake Factory just before noon and the wait was around 35 minutes - not bad! Unfortunately, service seems to have taken a 180. We waited about 15 minutes for the waitress to take our order and at the end, we waited another 15 minutes to get the bill. It just seemed super disorganized and it was clear we weren't the only table left frustrated (the one next to us waited for their drinks for a good 20+ minutes).

As for the food, it was decent but I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous dish I got (Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp). This time, I got the Steak Diane, medium rare, and it was very inconsistent - some pieces were a bit too raw while others were almost rock solid (3/5). My friend got the Chicken Bellagio and said it was just ok. The chicken was great but the pasta itself tasted hard and stale (2.5/5). The star of the show was the Korean Fried Cauliflower. Honestly, get this appetizer because it's so good! Even for picky \"carnivores\" they won't notice that it's a veggie, haha (5/5).

For the cheesecake, we ordered ours to go near the end of the meal and waited an additional 20 minutes for them. This was a bit funny because the table next to us asked if they should order their cheesecake to go immediately (they just sat down) and the waitress was like, \"You can wait to order at the end since they're coming out pretty fast today.\" If 20 minutes is fast, I don't know what to say. 

The new flavour we tried was the Carrot Cake Cheesecake, which we both agreed was lacking compared to the Red Velvet and Celebration cheesecakes. The actual carrot cake layer was small (and it felt like there were more nuts than carrot cake), and the slice was noticeably smaller than the other two (2/5). 

Overall, both the food and service was inconsistent with the first time being awesome, and the second time being pretty bad. I'd still recommend the restaurant since I think (in general) their cheesecakes are top notch. Just be prepared to wait. And wait. And wait some more, even after being seated or finished with your meal."}
{"text":"Okay so this review is all over the place, bare with me. First off let me immediately shout out Kevin for being nothing less than awesome. Overall a 3, I'll throw a 5 in to the equation for how they handled their crappy Sunday services. 4 for how the food was because it was just fine. We show up on Easter with no wait and last minute plans so I was pleasantly surprised to find and get a perfect outdoor patio table immediately for 4, at 11:00 and then... no one shows up for a solid 10 minutes for drinks or anything. There's 3 other tables patiently waiting with us so I finally go to get someone when a manager sees me coming. She says someone will be right there which ended up being her and another manager...so Cecil(I believe?) comes over super polite and takes our order, drink and food. Food comes out and the order is wrong. I tell the girl we ordered the brioche French toast and she starts to walk away,  I say we can keep this one(the child's brunch) it's fine she says hold on and I say uhh ok or you can walk away while I'm speaking to you (yes I'm a little feisty now) she comes back and says I was just checking the order I said yeah and walked away right when I was speaking which was super rude. Fast forward to Kevin, he hears my comments, comes over, and takes our table right away from there on out it was perfect! I must've made a stir  because the original manager came over and ended our service with 3 complimentary cheesecakes and a brioche French toast on them. I am impressed that they took responsibility for their slacking but man they really could've saved like $40 with their better communication skills and personable etiquette(cough cough server girl) I'm serious that if/when I go back I'll ask for Kevin because I could be wrong but I don't think he had responsibility for us and really stepped up."}
{"text":"Always the best service here! And legendary cheese cake  
Almost always busy busy, but i've never had a problem with my food or waiting too long! Loveeeeee it here always been a favorite"}
{"text":"I had really great food and service, Andy was our sever. He was very gracious and eager to help out with anything. He suggested a spicy lasts that was magnificent!"}
{"text":"I normally go to the CCF in Boca park, but a friend and I decided to try this location. It was around 2pm and upon entering we saw an older woman at the hostess stand. She glanced up at us, then looked back down. No greeting whatsoever! So I said hello there is 2 of us and she never spoke to us. How rude! CCF needs to realize in a huge way that the hostess is your first point of contact to your guests, and if they don't acknowledge or greet your paying customers, well....
Fast forward a month or so we decide to give this location another try (December 6, 2017). We see the same older woman now working with a hispanic looking young girl. Let me say this...the young girl couldn't even speak proper English and had no personality. That's it CCF, get your act together. Hire people on your front line who are personable, friendly and know how to greet the public!! It's not that hard to do!"}
{"text":"My son and I went to the my favorite place The Cheesecake Factory;
lately we go every Mother's Day. Well, went again this year, I was disappointed in my favorite Shrimp platter; the shrimp tasted strange and my son did not finish his Shrimp; which was unusual; he usually scarf them down. We spent good money for a decent meal; the meal was equivalent to a fast food dinner and probably could have come out better by going to a Long John Silver's or some other sorts. The restaurant used to be really good; but, what happens; quality goes down and I don't patronize it again. My plans for the future is to eat somewhere else; I strongly believe getting what you pay for and this trip was expensive and we did not get what we paid  for."}
{"text":"I've certainly eaten at other Cheesecake Factories around the U.S., so I had an idea what to expect. The Las Vegas location was a pleasant surprise.

My boyfriend (vegan) and I (vegetarian) were armed in the knowledge that, with the insanely large menu the Factory boasts, there will surely be something for us here. We shared the lettuce wrap appetizer, and I had the margareta flatbread, then a grown-up milkshake for dessert.

Because we ordered the lettuce wrap sans-poultry, the server brought us avocado to sub. This was the most surprising part of the meal: the lettuce wrap consisted of ultra fresh, crisp vegetables and delicious sauces. I would absolutely order this again, though I'm not much for salady wrap things.

My flatbread was crisp and warm (it's hard to mess up a margareta pizza, and the Cheesecake Factory provided the standard delicious flavour I'm expecting.) The milkshake included caramel, pretzels, booze, ice cream, whipped cream. An insane indulgence but truly flavourful, and I highly recommend this if (like me) you love the sweet and salty combination.

The FORVM Atlantis fountain show in the background can get irritating if you're not seated within the restaurant. (FFS, pick an heir to the kingdom already, aargh.)

For a large-scale, affordable (for Vegas) chain-restaurant, Cheesecake Factory offered us surprisingly fresh food and efficient service."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Good portions. The bread is great always refilling drinks without needing to ask. Would give 5 stars but my red velvet cheesecake tasted a bit stale for whatever reason."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal/experience here! I'm a creature of habit so I  usually order the same thing except here I tend to try new dishes!! The food is ALWAYS amazing and the service is up to par every single time. I've never spoken to a manager there and I see that as a good thing!! My aunt and I got the chicken nachos as an appetizer (which could feed a family of 6) and I got the Avacado chicken sandwich on rye with mozzarella which was to die for!! Not to mention I somehow found a way to get desert. I finished with a Reese's cup cheesecake which was incredible!! Already dreaming of the next time we ~"}
{"text":"Tried to have lunch on 9/20/2015. Promptly greeted and seated. Server was quick and courteous BUT SLOW. I ordered a Turkey burger and WAITED and WAITED and WAITED. Finally 25 minutes later someone from the kitchen comes to my table to say they were out of skinny buns for my burger and would it be ok to substitute wheat bread. Okay, just bring my food. WAITED and WAITED. Finally a manager (claiming to be very proactive) comes to the table to say they were extremely sorry for the delay but my food would be out soon. The kitchen gave my order to someone else. When the food finally arrived it was a cold piece of BEEF, not turkey as ordered served on a burned piece of wheat toast with grilled onions at the bottom. I ordered a Turkey Burger with avocado, NOT WHAT I GOT!!! Side salad was DRY DRY DRY. The manager apologized and comped my meal but the indigestion I am suffering with is \"PRICELESS\""}
{"text":"My wife and I have never really had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory at SouthPark Mall. Wait staff has always been on point and very attentive. Several times our servers have informed us on options that we were not previously aware of such as paying our bill through the iPhone App, new available Cheesecake options, and even pointing us to the bar for their happy hour specials. 

I would give this location a five star rating but there is one issue I have, consistency. The last couple of times we have gone to do the happy hour in the bar area, our apps that were ordered were different in taste each time. My favorite app are the potstickers, but I ordered them three times and all three time they were different. One time they were overdone, next time they were overloaded with the sauce, third time they were near perfect.  Same type of deal has happened with entrees ordered where one time my meatloaf was dry and the next time was slightly undercooked. 

My only negative is the consistency of the food sent out. Other than that, this location of Cheesecake Factory is a great one."}
{"text":"The food here is just okay, I never actually like sitting down and actually eating the meal, because they are really just okay. 

BUT!

The cheesecakes here are soooo good. I usually just come here for cheesecakes when I'm craving for it. Love the tiramisu cheesecake! I tried some of the other ones, the apple one good, but too sweet. The original cheesecake tasted pretty good too. I don't remember much of the other ones, but I know for sure that the tiramisu cheesecake is very good!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what was going on, but this was not a good trip to Cheesecake Factory. We went for lunch and chose to sit outside since it was nice. It took forever for our server to come take our order. When he brought out our water, there was a lot of debris floating in it. We sent them back and the same thing was in the second round. At this point, we all just opted to get soft drinks. Our appetizers were sub par as well. I love the avocado eggrolls at CF, but these were kinda brown looking and sad. The spinach and artichoke dip had a funny taste, I didn't even eat it. We all ended up ordering salads. When they came out, all the lettuce looked a little wilted. Like I said, it wasn't anything like my usual experiences at CF. Maybe it was just an off day...."}
{"text":"Pit Beef Dip- Pass it up. The sandwich was presented on a small sesame seed bun, while the roast beef was medium it was also fatty and the Au Jus was tasteless and presented in a tea cup, The side salad was plentiful but the Balsamic was lacking in flavor. Save you money."}
{"text":"Friend and I ordered two salads for lunch at work today.  It was $28, they left cashews of of the cashew salad and the only difference between the two was mine had peppers and his had tortilla strips.  Place is such a joke.  $28.  Give me a break"}
{"text":"waited 50 min at the table for the waiter to come back and tell us he forgot to put in our order. :-("}
{"text":"Their cheesecake is unbelievably delicious! With so many different flavors, it's incredibly difficult to decide which to get. Every time I come here I try to get a new flavor, but find myself getting the Oreo Dream Extreme or Tuxedo. Aside from the cheesecake, their food is also very good. Portion sizes are large so you usually have enough for leftovers and they are usually pretty quick with bringing you your food. While you're waiting they bring warm bread to your table, just don't fill up on its goodness. Staff is attentive and friendly, and  atmosphere is casual. Overall a good place to go with friends or family."}
{"text":"As expected, cheese cake factory doesn't really differ much to location. I came here with my friends for lunch since we were in vegas for the weekend.

The wait was only 15-20 minutes and since we were there for lunch we weren't sure how the portions were. We only had dinner at cheesecake and never lunch. So we asked about the lunch portions and still it was huge. My friend and I ended up sharing the BBQ chicken cobb salad which I absolutely love and my other friend got their fish and chips.

Service was fine. They were quick to get things to your table and our server was super nice. The food was the same as the one near brea mall, but it seemed the one here in vegas paid more attention to it because our salad wasn't drenched in the dressing. It seemed to be perfected dressed and you can taste the different tastes rather than everything having one flavor. That was probably the distinction between the two places which was nice for a change."}
{"text":"Came in around 7:30 on a Saturday thankfully it wasn't a long wait time, they greeted us our server Laurie was great, she didn't hover us which was nice because I wasn't in the mood to talk. I had the Chicken Madeira which is their most popular plate, ummm I wasn't a fan of it however my girlfriend had the Herb Parmesan chicken and it was sooooo good! Definitely recommend it! Lastly we had the Banana Cheesecake and that was even better, for us next time we order we might order ours with whip cream on the side, we thought it was a bit too much. At the end of the night we ended up crossing the street and realized we forgot our keys my girlfriend KINDLY asked the guy cleaning the table \"Sorry to bother you but have you seen some car keys?\" The waiter cleaning the table SIGHED and said NO I'm cleaning this table. Dude wtf! We realize this is not a fun job for you to have but it's your job to suck it up! No one decided this shitty job but yourself so don't be mad at the paying customer. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for having a lost and found policy well under control."}
{"text":"It's a chain. I tend to avoid restaurant chains as much as I can. But there is a special little spot of love in my heart for the CF. And it has everything to do with the Buffalo Blasts, variety of cheesecakes, and Lemon Drop martinis.

What, you don't know about the Buffalo Blasts?! They are perhaps one of the greatest appetizers ever devised. No, seriously. It's like a chicken wing chopped up, tossed with hot sauce and cheese, then stuffed into this crispy, fried triangle thingy. And then served with sides of an awesome hot sauce and an amazing blue cheese sauce. Tip: Order extra sides of the sauces right from the start. If you are a dipper, you're going to need extra. The Buffalo Blasts are basically some of the most awesome hot wings you will ever have.

Everyone knows about the cheesecakes. So many by the slice that choosing even just two or three becomes a challenge. I have been known to take home six different slices with me. My go-to fav, though, is the White Chocolate Raspberry. And, call it sad or not, but it is some of my favorite cheesecake of anywhere ever.

And I don't know what it is that they do to their Lemon Drop martinis, but I love them. I love them more than any other Lemon Drops from anywhere else. Maybe it's their lemonade. Maybe it's their sugar. I don't really care. I just know they are strong and delicious, and I need a friend to supervise me so I don't down like five of them.

This location can get busy, so be prepared for a wait. The bar area is on the small side. Overall, nothing particularly noteworthy or different - it's the same as the rest of the CF locations. Service is always good."}
{"text":"Tonight my fiancé and I took my parents to Cheesecake Factory to catch up over a slice of cheesecake and a cup of coffee (it was 5:30PM) We got our coffees right away, but had to ask for water twice. After about 30 minutes we had asked for our check and a box from our waitress. 20-25 minutes went by and we asked again, she said \"I'll be right back.\" Another 20 minutes goes by and we tracked down the manager. He apologized and said he would have the check right out to us. At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip. Never going back to this Cheesecake Factory again. Also, we never got our boxes for our leftover cheesecake."}
{"text":"Just want to say to make sure you double check your leftovers if you have any as I didn't realize until the next day they messed up mine and gave me someone's else! I still had half of my meal left too. It was an unpleasant and disappointing surprise."}
{"text":"We have visited this  cheesecake factory multiple  times for special occasions or quick lunches through out the years. When we first arrived by spouses asked for a table and we were taken right back to be seated no waiting! The only bad part is we were given a booth. This wasn't a deal breaker for me. We made do with what we were given our server came over put napkins down on the table she brought over cups of water and advised us she would be back momentarily to take our drink order. ..20 minutes later we were still waiting. During this time I witnessed our employee stop at a pos station three different time to talk to 3 separate employees. Finally I flagged her down in the midst of trying to provide our drink order she talked over me to ask if that's all we wanted? We did end up ordering food and it was prepared beautifully. The flavors and textures were amazing like they always are. I was just extremely  dissapointed by the customer service. Usually  management  stops over to ask how everything was and for some reason that didn't occur this time around. It didn't seem paticularly too busy  this day. As I advised we (a family of 5) were seated right away and in my opinion if u have time to talk u have time to take orders. I hope our next visit goes better."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this was my first time venturing to The Cheesecake Factory and I had heard many rumors of the unhealthiness of the food. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and I figured that since I was going to take a hit between that and a slice of cheesecake, I should get a salad with balsamic vinaigrette as my side. The sandwich came out and it was the greasiest thing I have ever eaten. The bun tasted like it had been deep fried and then soaked in oil overnight - completely unnecessary. To my astonishment, my salad came out with a cream-based balsamic vinaigrette. There's just no reason to put cream in everything. That being said, the service was spectacular and my slice of coconut cheesecake was ridiculously good. 

Overall - great service and cheesecake, insanely unhealthy food. Still a good place to go, but I would probably stick to dessert next time."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is known for its cheesecake, so you must save room for cheesecake!

This is a nicely decorated, very clean establishment with knowledgeable, friendly staff, most of whom have sampled much of the food and can offer recommendations.

We split a delicious beet, walnut, apple, arugula and goat cheese salad.  Our split entree was also very good: steak Diane, mashed potatoes and herb crusted salmon.  Had dessert, what else, cheesecake and it made us swoon!  We were totally satisfied with everything.  

Order wisely, split courses, but save room for the cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"The food was lacking flavor big time. If they would add even a pinch of salt and pepper the food would be great. Pasta had a perfect cook and very fresh. The disappointment was due to the lack of flavor. Sad, I was looking forward to this place"}
{"text":"Whoever manages the lines for ordering cheesecake and the cash register needs to be fired.  The food is good but try running the business and managing expectations instead of pissing all your customers off."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest cheesecake factory I've visited. The forks and spoons were very dirty and placed directly on the table. The waitress was a bit mean sounding, not sure what her name was but she had short hair and sounded like she was from London/England. She gave my girlfriend a ton of attitude while she was making her order. I understand that my girl was being a little indecisive and it may have been annoying but you are suppose to have patience when you are a server. I asked for extra bread and was given the hardest bread ever. The first batch of bread was fresh. I ordered 2 sides of mac and cheese and a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were cold and seemed like they werent even fully cooked. The mac and cheese was delicious but I found a hair in it so that kind of ruined it for me. This is the worst and dirtiest cheesecake factory I've ever been to. They need to hire a new manager and new servers. If they don't change things up soon I see this place getting shut down in the near future. Don't eat here unless you want to get sick. This place should change it's name to the Germs Factory.

To top all of that off. The server decided to leave her shift before we were even done eating. How much ruder can you be? Servers always wait until their customers finish. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Very busy for early Saturday evening, 6pm. However, we were told 30 minutes & were called in +/- 15minutes! Friendly, approachable, informative hostesses, wait staff & other staff. Huge menu of many various foods. I had the herb-crusted salmon which was prepared perfectly & my taste buds danced for joy! My hubby had a salad with the same type of salmon atop it, & was equally delighted!  The Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake sent me heaven-bound! If you've never been here, DO NOT miss this food destination! Yummmmmmmmm.........."}
{"text":"Eat here for lunch often - always get treated well by the staff - seated quickly,
they are very organized when it comes to seating.  Today, I had the Margarita Pizza,
it was very good and very reasonably priced.  They servers always watch our time to
make sure we get back to work within our lunch hour."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow.  Went for dessert last night.  Had the Choc Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake.  We were served the cake right away, but sat there waiting and waiting for a check.  The cheesecake was fabulous."}
{"text":"2nd visit and always well worth it even though it's pricey. Pasta dishes are always yummy. But their nachos are divine. Of course the cheesecake. I've had key lime and mango key lime. The mango key lime...no words to describe...it's a must have it again!

Boyfriend got the 30th anniversary cheesecake...loved it!

We shall be back."}
{"text":"Now I remember why I didn't go back: mediocrity. 
I'm not much for chains to begin with, but this place is so strange and I cannot fathom why anyone would wait in line to eat here (or, pick a location, because the menu's are the same).
I tried to order the crabcake sandwich and asked the (not-so-nice-fake-smiling) waitress if the brioche had any seeds or nuts on it and she said \"no\". Sure enough, it came with sesame seeds slathered all over the bun (why or why are there sesame seeds on every friggin bun in this country?). I sent it back and the waitress came over and said \"sorry, I didn't know...do you want me to bring it back?\" I've never been asked such a stupid question....ever!
My husband had the fish and chips and the fish was greasy, the fries were boring and the cole slaw was good. 
Seriously, there are some great places to eat here, so why bother with a chicken on everything, nut on everything, corn on everything mediocre meal?"}
{"text":"this was my first experience at the Cheesecake Factory in all it's existence.  my cousin had her 15th birthday dinner here and my first impression... BUSY! [Which didn't shock me.. because every time I come across a Cheesecake Factory, it always seems to be busy!]

anyway, it's a nice looking place in a nice area with plenty of parking and seats to sit down outside because it's always obviously busy.   
we were seated within the 20 minute time frame that they gave us.. which was understandable because we were a big party.  it is a shopping mall so there's a little bit of window shops to look at while you wait.  

we were finally seated and it seemed well kept... and for how busy it seemed it's a pretty good job they do of keeping this place up.   It's a large restaurant with lots of seating and lots of patrons.  Idk, I'm not big on the large crowds and large places so I guess that's why this review pretty much sucks.

anyway, the menu is LARGE.  I use the word overwhelming a lot, but this menu is truly overwhelming.  there's like.. 2,000 things on this menu.  luckily everything had a description.

so I had the Factory Burrito Grande.  nothing special about it... typical.  only it was huge.... like the size of a baby huge. 

the cheesecake I have to admit was really good.  they were huge pieces and the waiter let us know that so we didn't go all out and order 1 slice per person.   the slice was seriously good enough for 4 people.  they were huge... but very good. 

eh... it's not a first choice for me.  i like small dives and secrets.  i don't know.. it was just alright. sorry.  again, this review sucks and i don't care cause i don't think i'll ever take a drive to this place ever again anyway.  so thanks for the baby burrito."}
{"text":"Perhaps I expected too much.  It is pretty hyped up.  

The food was OK (I got the Shepherd's Pie, Artichoke Dip, and my friend got one of the sandwiches).

It was just so busy that we felt like we were being herded like cattle, and the service was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"We love cheesecake factory. Good, consistent service and food. Been to chandler only once, our server was very attentive and helpful with my wife's allergy to dairy. Always a good job Cheesecake Factory! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory!!  The atmosphere ,
The ambiance, the food. The dessert , the service etc.
I always order 
The mojitio  or the Asian pear martini to start off then get the Asian salad or the pepperoni pizza and for dessert the nice and warm apple cobbler.

I like Cheesecake Factory off of rampart/ Boca Park and sit outside at night to feel the breeze and watch the traffics go by."}
{"text":"Was super disappointed, after waiting in line for 2 1/2 hours our server was very rude and made it seem like she didn't want to be serving us, gave 3 stars though cause the cheesecake was delicious, would go back again once it dies down and if we got a different server"}
{"text":"Once my favorite local restaurant, this location now specializes in disappointment.  My last three to go orders have been wrong, lost, very late, and often a combination of all three.   Managers refuse to credit your card - even for food you don't get - which has caused me to contest charges with my AMEX company.  Instead they offer issue you a credit for the wronged item and ship it to your house.  Sometimes it comes....Most times, it does not.  

Is the food good?  Sure....if you can get it. Overall there are too many other options in Summerlin...We don't need to be subjected to poor service and execution."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is good, employees are great, atmosphere is great. The only minus is the parking lot. It can be really crowded in the parking lot and could be difficult to find a close spot to park in."}
{"text":"SWEET!

With all the calories that could be potentially consumed at any TCF location, dining at TCF is a bonafide treat (for me, personally).  My mom and I both love cheesecake, and therefore we couldn't pass up the chance of dining at this location.

LOCATION / SETTING:
The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace near the aquarium.  Restaurant is 2 floors, with some seating on the first floor having views of the aquarium and Atlantis Show.  

side NOTE:  
We actually visited this location twice during our vacation last month.  The first time for take out cheesecake from their counter, and the 2nd for lunch on our last day.

FOOD:
The menu is enormous!  So much choices/selections....and that's just the dessert section.  The menu has appetizers, salads, sandwiches, entrees, pastas, etc.  Even for the most finicky of eaters, I'm sure there must be something on this menu that is appealing.

After some time, we decided on the egg roll sampler, while my mom chose the Shepard's Pie, my brother selected the super oxidant salad, and I ordered the BBQ chicken salad (lunch portion).  For drinks, my mom and I ordered coffee, and my brother was all smiles when the server confirmed they could make him a Bloody Mary.

The egg rolls were ok.  They were a bit more oily than I expected, but I shouldn't have been surprised since we ordered fried food for an appetizer.  Not sure if I would order this again.  Thereafter, our entrees were delivered to the table, and I am so happy there were lunch sizes available because my salad seemed (to me) as if it were a FULL SIZE order.  It was massive!  It was just enough for myself, but unfortunately I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  If I were to order this again on a future visit, I would probably ask for no fried onions/onion rings (it just seemed a bit excessive to me).  My brother enjoyed his salad and finished the entire serving.  My mom, on the other hand, found her choice to just be mediocre.  In hindsight, she admitted she should have chosen something else such as a salad or sandwich.  

Lastly, the cheesecake (like always) was very satisfying.  We ordered (at the take out counter) one slice each of the key lime and pumpkin seasonal cheesecake.  I felt we needed to order the pumpkin since its a seasonal flavor, and we both concurred that both slices weren't overly sweet.

SERVICE:
Very exceptional.  The hostess was friendly and seated us immediately (we arrived at around 1045 am on a Saturday; the restaurant opened at 10am that day).  Our server was a friendly and knowledgeable woman, who answered all our menu questions, and periodically checked on us throughout our meal.  

One last thing to mention:  the staff at the take out counter were polite and very efficient.  

BOTTOM LINE:
Convenient (take a break while shopping!) and spacious location.  Great service.  Delicious desserts!  Yay Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"My husband & I couldn't believe how well we ate for the price we paid. The service was very good, the atmosphere was not loud despite being located inside the Forum Shops & our food was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Had such an awesome dinner experience tonight! Thank you Brett, working the outdoor patio tonight around 8:30p! Loved the fact that they allow service dogs, cuz our pups enjoyed dinner on the outdoor patio too! 

Sooooooo it's Cheesecake Factory! Who doesn't LOVE The Cheesecake Factory?! If you love delicious dishes?! Cuz that's what you'll find here at Cheesecake. The menu is huuuuuuuge, be prepared it will take you a hot minute to find what you want to eat. My favorite dish is Chicken Piccata.  This dish has a bed of angel hair pasta with a creeeeaaammmmy white sauce with juicy chicken, capers and mushrooms. I love this dish! 

You can't go wrong with the many options at The Cheesecake Factory. Seriously! For dessert, we opted for the red velvet cheesecake! Order this if you want some good good in your belly. 

Note: if it's not too hot out, and if they have the misters going- sit in the outdoor patio, you'll catch a beautiful sunset. Soooo romantic!"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory.  Awesome service and good, just need to remind myself that need to call ahead to minimize the wait time."}
{"text":"While my friend and I were in Madison doing some shopping we had a craving for cheesecake. What better place to go other then the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake and my friend ordered chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake. Both were excellent. Whenever I am near a Cheesecake Factory I always stop and get one to go."}
{"text":"I like coming here when  I feel like a local night out. Cheesecake factory is a nice way to wrap up dinner and a movie with some coffee and cake. The entree's are ok. Pretty much everything is reheated or deep fried from large frozen bags. The portions are big and the ambience is upscale casual. Stick with coffee and cake out on the patio on a nice night and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Don't come here until they figure out their new menu. We ordered a couple items off the new skinny menu and supposedly they are now cooking their thousands of menu items on the broiler. Maybe they are \"skinny\" items because you will starve, it was an hour and a half till we got our food and all the manager could offer was 2 free cheesecakes (half of a normal portion) in return for a black and blue steak (which I sent back-it was ordered medium), cold fries, cold chicken tacos, cold burger with un-melted cheese, etc. It wasn't our waiters fault he did everything he could to deal with it and we tipped him accordingly. We ended up fighting our $150 bill and got our entrees removed since we ordered 3 rounds of drinks and there was something wrong with all of the entrees, the bill was still over $90. For tonight's performance, i would give no stars if I could."}
{"text":"just in love with that place. Its the same menu as in the us. be ready to wait, 3h on the week end. but for a good and fat cheese cake ... who can resist."}
{"text":"The real cheesecake factory is in my kitchen, just so you know. We had to stifle a sneer when the waiter tried to push dessert on us. I have had their cheesecake before this, and it just isn't very good.

We are also huge fans of The Big Bang Theory, and since Penny works there, and Sheldon will actually eat there, how bad could it be? Analysis: not *bad*, just decidedly mediocre.

I had the fish and chips. The fish was bland and overcooked, and the fries were pretty terrible. The zucchini small plate/app we had was flavorful and the zucchini was not fried to mush. The ranch it came with had a nice garlic zing to it. Hubby had the veggie quesadilla (a breakfast item, technically) and described it as \"fine\" but otherwise unremarkable.

Sorry, Penny. I hope your salary on the show increases due to the heavy product placement fees that CF must be paying, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Upset they got rid of the eggplant sandwhich but it's not a big deal they still have plenty of other stuff for me to eat. The waiting time to sit isnt long and worth the wait! Great food with tons of choices and amazing service! I have never been to a cheesecake factory that i didnt like. Oh yeah they have a nice bar for those who drink."}
{"text":"My friends and I normally hit this restaurant whenever we go out. Sometimes you do have to wait awhile to get a table. 

The food is decent. The decor is nice.The staff is friendly. Honestly I would rather buy a cheesecake then eat the appetizers/entree's.

Go for the gold...skip the food go for the dessert!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is about 1 hr & 10 mins away from me. I live in Uniontown, so I love to travel to Pittsburgh every now and then for a wider variety of restaurants, shopping malls, and more. This place is to die for! I had a spicy chicken sandwich with fries, which was HUGE! Great size for the price! And of course, the main reason I go is the cheesecake. Oh my God. The Reese's Cheesecake is heaven. The building is gigantic, and beautiful. It has a nice patio, and a garden area to sit down in. Plus, all of the shops downtown make it a great, and busy spot! Which is the only downfall, it is way too busy! I waited an hour and a half just for my friend and I to eat here, but in the end, it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"This was the least crowded of all the chains on Father's day - only a 30 minute wait at 3pm and we weren't even celebrating that holiday. Usually pretty solid choice, but some missteps in the food today. The glaring issue was a fly in the ice tea. My lunch Luoa salad sounded good on paper, but did not cut the mustard in person. It had three large wontons, but was lacking chicken and contained too much cabbage for a salad. Other people got the club sandwich and they use good quality meats, but the best part was the $5.95 stuffed mashed potato balls. Large menu, but still best to stick to the favorites and not go too far off track."}
{"text":"Out of every chain restaurant this is probably the best. Definitely on the pricy side but worth it. But the food is always good and fresh. They do have a large variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant that's very large inside. The place was packed with customers around 5pm, so it was pretty loud inside. The cheesecakes are sold by the entrance, where you can purchase whole cheesecakes or slices. The pricing for them was surprisingly high. Some of the whole cheesecakes ranged from $20 to $50 or more. The slices were $7 to $9, which are small in length, but a lot taller than the normal cheesecake you would find somewhere else so the slices are still very fulfilling. When we first came in, the hostess wasn't very welcoming, but the servers were great throughout the entire time we dined there! They were attentive and friendly. The food was awesome, it was freshly cooked and hot. The wait time for the food wasn't long at all, approximately 10 minutes. Overall, I do recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a smart crowd at the front desk of this factory. The older gray haired guy (manager?) seated us near the bar with menu's, but 15 minutes later, nobody had even said hello etc. Granted, we could have flagged down somebody, but that's not my job. You seat me and then you serve me, that's how it works. It's ok, I got my shots into Mr. grey hair guy as we moseyed on out the door and he had the nerve to ask where we were seated twice. Dude, you just seated us you idiot. Anyway, I still like the factory on occasion, but they had a bad day on this evening."}
{"text":"Pros: AMAZING FOOD. Great view. Beautiful location. It's HUGE! Great waiters, the drinks tasted spectacular...want me to continue?
Cons: People at the front desk were kinda rude. Maybe that's cause they were busy.
Cloak Anecdote: People looked at me funny when I whipped out my giant DSLR+flash in the middle of the restaurant and started taking pictures of my food. Hey, I'm a photographer. Deal with it.

I fell in love the moment I saw this Cheesecake Factory.
It was huge, and glowing with purple...it was majestic. 
We had to wait 15 minutes, but that was okay, cause I just went into Express while I waited and then I looked at the fishies swimming around.

I went inside and was greeted by this host who was full of life and really brightened my day as he led me to my table (I was having a bad day up until that point). 

The waiter was even better. He was super nice and accomodating. He refilled my drinks before I even realized my drink was gone.  He boxed up our food and everything-something not all CF waiters offer to do.

And is it just me, or does the Coca-cola taste AMAZING?!?! 

The food-oh my Caesar (bad pun). I ordered the garlic noodles and they were flour-y bundles of goodness soaked in garlic butter and garnished with large, luscious shrimp. If it wasn't for the fact that I stress-ate myself to oblivion in the previous hour I would've eaten it all and gained 2340398034975304 pounds(and that is not a hyperbole).
My sister ordered the salad and loved it. It was seriously the BIGGEST salad I'd ever seen.Two huge mounds of salad adorned with ranch. Impressive.

Would I go here again?
The question is, WHEN will I go here again?"}
{"text":"I ate here with a group of 6 while visiting Las Vegas. We had a late lunch so it wasn't very crowded. Our server was great -- very attentive and prompt. My boyfriend and I shared the chipotle chicken pasta and it was definitely big enough for two. Our friends all ordered cheesecake that looked amazing. Try to get a seat inside to cut down on some of the noise from \"The Fall of Atlantis\" fountain show that happens every so often outside in the Forum Shops."}
{"text":"This is a review for the cheesecake only...

It was my mom's birthday yesterday, so after leaving the strip, we decided that she needed some sort of \"cake\" on her birthday!  It was 10:30pm (they close at 11pm) and I pulled into Cheesecake Factory. 

We were sat at a nice table and they gave us a full menu and offered to bring out bread.  We told them we were only having dessert. (but nice to know that they continue serving the full menu until close!)

My mom picked the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake and I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake.

I found the waiter and let him know that it was my mom's birthday.  They came out with \"Happy Birthday Lisa\" written on the plate in chocolate, a candle and sang \"Happy Birthday To You\".  It was very nicely done!

The cheesecake was delicious (took some home for later!).  The service was great- he refilled our water and decaf coffee very promptly.

I will definitely go here again just for dessert!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly about the dessert and not any of the menu items.

I see so many 5 stars and I guess if you would want average desserts that load up the sugar and chocolate sauces to mask the flavor then hey this is the 5 star place for you!

Had their Godiva cheesecake and since I wanted something with WOW chocolate decided on the chocolate blackout cake.  Now, would one except a dark chocolate almost slightly bitter taste of real cocoa when ordering the Godiva Dark Chocolate?  Or instead how about just giving a really over sweetened chocolate cheese cake with no real homemade texture that may perchance resemble a taste similar to Hershey's ?  

Chocolate Blackout Cake- increase the portion size to feed 3 people, decrease the quality of the ingredients and add again the sweet chocolate syrup with an almost artificial chocolate taste upon the cake that is like a box mix.  Voila...charge $9.00 for equivalent of Betty Crocker box cake!

Don't mean to go hard on the CF, but most of their menu items on their appetizer side and small plates are fried (one or two healthy ones only), and again from what I see, if you want a ton of food for not a lot of money then sure its great.  I haven't tried their entrees yet, but am a bit hesitate to do so.  Just don't want to set myself up for disappointment.

For the service side- seen the same service issues everyone else talks about.  For some reason these corporate chains either hire managers who don't know what they heck they are doing, or decide to offer a pay scale so low that no one takes the job seriously and could care less if they work there or not.  How about pay a few more dollars per hour and hire people who take their job seriously?  And find a real manager, which again might cost a few more dollars but could be worth it."}
{"text":"Thanks Colin for the lunch service!

I got the Rene's special with the small Caesar salad, onion soup, and the Chicken Sandwich which was just enough to fill me up.

The Calamari was too salty for me. 

The stuff mushrooms were bomb though!"}
{"text":"Honestly, their dining foods are so-so. 
But all of their cheesecakes are fantastic!
 My favorite flavor is fresh strawberry cheesecake! 
It is good to having some date with fiance,family dinner,or brunch with my girlfriends"}
{"text":"Minus the 20 page menu and bad reputation for being overpriced and not that good, I kinda like this place. So shoot me. I came to this location for a drink, so I can't say anything about their food, but Doug, the bartender, is awesome. I immediately asked him what the weirdest thing that has ever happened to him was, and he was more than willing to share his stories.. something about eggs, I don't really remember (blame it on his shot count, which was well over 5 seconds) from there he was chatty Cathy till the tab was dropped. 

If and when I come back here, I will get my usual - Tex Mex eggrolls to start, followed by the Chicken Madeira, and the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to complete a totally unhealthy ungodly amount of above average food.

Cheers Doug!"}
{"text":"They forgot my daughter's Mac & Cheese. Food was typical: ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp.  Server never really followed up on drink refills and food orders."}
{"text":"The Good: Strawberry lemonades are the bomb! Still the same, they haven't skimped on this drink. Plain cheesecakes are still very good, even though the people working behind the counter can be pretty rude. Avocado eggrolls are amazing, they seem to be using the same original recipe. We always get the crab and artichoke dip, that's consistently good. Great ambiance, large glasses!

The Bad: Salad portions are wayyyyy down. The Santa Fe salad - used to be piled high, now they skimp on the beans and corn! My grandfather got this every time we visited. This last one he told the waiter how small the salad was and the waiter said \"that's the way they come\".

Cobb salad is not a traditional Cobb salad. CF's only has three thin slices of chicken about 3\" long that looks like deli meat, 1 tbsp of blue cheese, one strip of crumbled bacon, about 1/4 of an egg white crumbled into teeny tiny pieces about 1 mm in diameter small pieces of diced tomato. Gone are the slices of hard boiled egg, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and chunks of chicken you'd expect. Complete waste of $15.

Some wait staff don't seem like they enjoy being there or enjoy you being there. Pretty consistently we've gotten one incorrect dish per table.

This restaurant used to be great with large portions at reasonable prices. Now it seems that to keep up their profits, they keep skimping on ingredients and portion sizes over the years. Too bad, we all used to like coming here, but we've decided our families won't be celebrating any more events there!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in last night for our 3 yr anniversary and we had such a great time. Our server, Desiree, was the absolute best. I love the brown bread there and she ended up bringing us lots of it. The food came out quickly and delicious. And to top it all off at the end when she brought us our cheesecake she decorated the cheesecakes and put candles on them. I'm really happy we went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate our 3 yr, and I'm really happy we got Desiree. ASK FOR HER."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is delicious. It's a chain restaurant so I feel it's pretty average everywhere. The service is always kind, a little slow in getting food out, but still kind."}
{"text":"I ordered a Shepherd's pie as i tried it before at somewhere else for $8 and wanted a comparison. CF charged $22 for the dish and it was too salty that i could barely taste the beef. I even tried my friends' food and they all tasted either too salty or too dry. If something that simple but you cant even cook it well, then it is really a disappointment. I dont know how a high-end restaurant could hire a chef that made such bad food. Not worth the wait or the hype. 
Word of sincere advice: if you have the money, go to a restaurant where you get seated and served right away (not have to wait for over 2 hours and receive disappointment) and if you can't cook, go to a restaurant that won't ruin your appetite, or at least you wont get ill for eating too salty/sweet food."}
{"text":"After a meeting a coworker and I decided to stop here for lunch. The great thing is you can order from their small plates menu and share different foods. We had fried zucchini , blue cheese / pear flat bread, and then chicken wraps with a spicy sauce. This is a great way to nibble without going overboard. We were sat right away and had a great server. I was very happy with our service , our server had a sense of humor and was very outgoing ! We were tempted to have cheesecake , how can you come here and not do it ? So our server was kind enough to split one Strawberry cheesecake in half to serve to us. This was a great experience with great food , hands down."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I loved the atmosphere, but what I loved most was our server! She was so sweet and courteous. Made sure we had everything we needed and checked on us regularly, not overbearing."}
{"text":"Location
Oh, Yorkdale, your parking sucks and it's not you, it's the people who can't drive or park and still come to your mall. Let me give you guys advice, if you can't park properly please do us all a favour and don't drive! Option B is to park underground and locate the green lights so you know the spot is available.

History
My first time at Cheesecake Factory was in Buffalo and I thought it was amazing. Back then the restaurant was one of the first to implement vibrating pagers - or those discs you see that light up when your meal is ready. The classic orange decor has been brought to Toronto as well and gives off a warm cozy feeling that's just right for many families. Is it a romantic getaway? Probably not. Cheesecake Factory provides large portions and even in the States, there was a bit of a wait.

Service
The waiters and waitresses were nice, albeit a bit fake/robotic in their gestures. Nevertheless, they were fine from the start but totally crashed near the end. First thing, the food takes FOREVER to arrive. Thank god that they prep the bread fast but I swear half the time we were just waiting for our food. Our waiter also took a century to get our bill ready  I usually don't take an entire star off of a rating because of service, but dude, you guys are a part of the Cheesecake Factory train - get your service up.

Food
Portions are large, I repeat, LARGE. I was actually quite impressed with the quality and thought it was better than I anticipated. To begin, my boyfriend got the 'Pasta Naploetana' which was better than my 'Shepherd's Pie'. The sauce was on point, the meat was cooked right, great combination of toppings, and it was super delicious. I absolutely adore the fact that they didn't douse the whole thing in sauce, their quantity of meat was just right, and it didn't feel too greasy or oiley after the meal. My shepherd's pie was not bad, pretty decent, I think my only complaint comes from the gravy - seems a little sour and something was a bit off. I think it could have used a different kind of stock (perhaps they used beef stock)? The mash itself could be more creamy - perhaps more milk?"}
{"text":"I'm not too sure what the hype is about. Yes the cheesecake is rich in flavour and super dense however the service was all over the place. I just wanted a simple cheesecake for dessert since we ate dinner elsewhere. They first sent us through and across the dining space, then they told us to take a seat near the bar so we found two spots and decided to order. Server got our order and right before it came out, someone came to us saying how the tables got mixed up so they kicked us out of our seats and told us that there will be a 30 mins wait. At that point I didn't care to sit so I said I'll take a slice to go. I paid and waited at the counter, where they had to take a slice and pack it, but it literally took them 25 minutes to do so. I've been here many times and this was the smallest slice I've ever received and it was broken upon receiving it. I was quite disappointed at the service and will take my sweet time before deciding to return here."}
{"text":"amazing place to eat! So good, portions are huge. While in vegas I got a bellagio chicken because it made me think of the belliagio hotel. So good! I also like their pastas, pasta da venchi and evelyns. My dad loves their meat loaf. Everything is really good and portions are so generous! Moderately priced. Located in cesars palace. Annoyed that the water is served in a plastic cup, get some glass ones! Free bread, the brown one is amazing!"}
{"text":"Yesterday 12/14 was my husbands birthday. He absolutely loves cheesecake so I thought we could make the hour drive from Kitchener to Toronto to celebrate his birthday. I wanted it to be special because this is the first birthday between the two of us since we got married 6 months ago. I called ahead and asked the wait time, someone told me about an hour. Seemed reasonable. When we get there, there's a lineup well into the mall where we had to wait 30 minutes before even getting our name on the waiting list and a buzzer. Only to be told the wait was two an a half hours. The hostess then told us that we could wait at the bar for a place to clear up since it's first come first serve. We decided to do that. We asked a waitress if the tables by the bar counted as the bar area, she said yes, and that she would personally serve us. We saw an open table set up for two, took off our coats, hats, etc and sat down, so happy and relieved we could celebrate his birthday here after all. A different hostess came up to us and asked us to leave. She told us the area we were in was seated only and not first come first serve. We had to get up in front of all those people watching, put our coats on, and leave. The service here sucks, it is so unorganized and this was such an embarrassing experience for us. I am from Chicago and we've had Cheesecake Factory a handful of times. Never have we had this happen to us before. My husband was so upset, he didn't want to wait any more and we drove another hour back to Kitchener. Birthday night ruined. Save your time and money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"We don't often eat at The Cheesecake Factory, we met with our extended family for a Sunday meal. Our experience was stellar, thanks to the effort of our Server - David. He is one of the best servers we have had at any restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"Love Cheesecake Factory and not for the cheesecake. Great bar. Good drinks with good pours!  Large portions of food. I love their loaded potato soup. Tried their warm crab dip with bread and it was delish!  Grilled chicken Caesar salad is fresh and huge. Service is great. Friendly. We go early so no wait. Can get packed as well as parking lot but it's in a great location so I can see why it would be busy."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Cheesecake Factory. The first time do not go so well. We were there with neighbors for brunch on a Saturday. It was a please time. The wait staff was excellent and made some good suggestions on selections for breakfast items. The Bloody Marys were good also, very spicy, just as I like them. I have an omelette with chicken chorizo. I was surpised how good it was. Now nothing beats pork, but it was good and most likely healthier for me. Will we return? Most likely yes, at least for brunch."}
{"text":"Seated quickly. Everything was beautiful, had a nice quiet booth in the back. Our waiter \"KEN\" was funny, helpful & kind, hope to have him as our waiter from now on. The appetizers were amazing, we had calamari & fried zucchini. Our meals were herb salmon, swordfish, chicken & biscuit, pepperoni kids pizza, all very delicious. We saved room for dessert for my birthday where we had the Oreo & 30th anniversary cheesecake HEAVENLY! Our waiter KEN and about a half dozen or more waiters/waitresses joined in on singing me happy birthday & lighting a candle they had put in my slice. Nothing but great memories, thank you everyone at this location you're amazing !"}
{"text":"It's a Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain. It's over-priced. But it sure is tasty. And there are so many food, drink, and dessert options. I can dine forever on just appetizers here.

This particular location is nestled in the Caesar's Forum Shops. It's rarely too crazy busy where there's a wait. I prefer dining on the faux \"patio\" so I can people watch the mall. And you can sorta see, albeit mostly hear, the free show thingy that happens at the fountain / fish tank out front of this location.

Service was decent. A bit scattered. But attentive and friendly enough.

On my visit here, they were out of buffalo blasts. Which was incredibly sad as those are the absolute most greatest thing ever at Cheesecake Factory. In fact, they are the best take on buffalo wings my taste buds have had the pleasure of enjoying.

But it wasn't a total dismal thing as there was a new (at least to me) menu item - buffalo chicken meatballs. They were just like the buffalo blasts, but in meatball form. Extremely tasty.

The mac 'n' cheese bites were also a hit. The Cheesecake Factory really does do this trendy appetizer better than most.

All the other appetizers we sampled were tasty too, but less memorable and crave-worthy.

All in all, there are far better, more unique, Vegas-specific places to throw down your money for good eats. But when you need to please a crowd, have a specific craving, everywhere else is full, and/or you just need to get off your feet and eat right now and you're right by here... It's better than most other chains and it's got decent people watching."}
{"text":"The food is always good here. But the one thing that killed it was the waiter he had a horrible attitude with all my friends and I he mocked one of my friend and when we told him that we were not ready to order he did not come back for another 30 min we were just sitting there like idiots so I decided I was not going to tip this guy so y scratched out the tip line and only payed the total. He had the odyssey to walk behind me and said to rewrite the tip and the total. We will go out or way and just go to The new one that just oped up in the north premium outlets."}
{"text":"9 times out of 10 I love my food, but every now and again I get a dud. Service is always pretty good. Great place to come if you have a party of people with different food carvings because the menu is so big it pretty much has everything one could want, including a separate healthy menu."}
{"text":"Why does this place have mediocre ratings?  I love cheesecake. It is one of my favorite restaurants. I will say service is hit or miss, especially depending on how busy it is. BUT majority of the time my food comes in time, my drink doesn't run too low, and my check is closed without too much waiting. Food is consistent. I love their chicken Caesar,  has a nice kick. Their kobe beef burger is so good. 4 cheese or Louisiana pasta. Chicken Madeira, or bang bang chicken is always good. Avocado egg rolls are a good app. And the cheesecake .... love the red velvet, Tiramisu and Chris outrageous. Get the godiva sundae. My husband and I come here once a week. Michael is by far the best server my hubby and I have had!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for the west side location to open up and finally visited. From the two hostess' to my server, it was a very friendly staff! I, for the life of me can't remember my server's name but he was great! He offered my baby a cut up banana to keep him happy and bread, while waiting for my takeout, which was last minute. He didn't have to but it really is the little things that made my, short, experience good."}
{"text":"I order the chicken fettuccine Alfredo pasta for take out and it was disgusting. The sauce was really grainy and the chicken wasn't even cook completely, the pasta was the same way not cooked completely and stuck together. Bad experience over all."}
{"text":"What can I really say bad about this place, every time my wife and I go we get great service, great food and great pricing. I always go with there chinese chicken salad. My wife usually gets a chicken dish or the fish which both are amazing. She also gets the chicken sandwhich. I am not a huge cheesecake fan but I can see why everyone loves it so much. 

This place rocks, never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Food is average at best.  But last two times the service was terrible.  They need to retrain their servers in customer service.  The only reason for the 2 stars is that there is no denying that their cheesecake is excellent."}
{"text":"I don't frequent chain restaurants often; however, I do enjoy The Cheesecake Factory. 

I heard not too long ago that grocery stores will be selling their brown bread and I would be lying if I said that didn't make me a little excited. 

My favorite dish on the menu is the herb crusted salmon. It's served over mashed potatoes with grilled asparagus. I've ordered this before during both lunch and dinner. I would say the serving is comparably the same amount; however, lunch is significantly less priced. 

And lastly, most importantly - my favorite cheesecakes would have to be either Oreo or tiramisu!

Tip: On your birthday, they give you a complimentary cheesecake of your choice."}

I believe they even sell the hot fudge at the bakery counter.

{"text":"This is a 3.5 review. The cheesecake of course was amazing and very large. I would absolutely just go to eat the cheesecake. It was well worth the price. 

The shrimp scampi that I order was  good but a lot smaller than I expected. My boyfriend has the Cajun pasta and It was more of what I was expecting. The scampi was sort of bland as well. 


Other than that this was excellent ! Our server was on point and super nice. I would come back but not get that dish."}

We had the Sweet Potato Fries and the Corn Succotash (barbequed corn, beans, and bell peppers). They were both excellent! Later we also had the Carrot Cake Cheesecake which was also good. The only negative are how high the prices are here, otherwise I'd come more regularly."}
{"text":"I went here for Friday dinner and the day after for Saturday lunch. This is how much I LOVE this place. The Cheesecake Factory has such a huge list on the menu, I feel like I could go here for a month and still not get the same food. The atmosphere is great for families, friends, dates  and just anyone! And also as a bread addict, I cannot skip mentioning about their wheat and sourdough bread. This place truly has the best bread. 
Getting their organic coffee after a HUGE meal w their decadent Kahlua cheesecake is another great part too. I don't think any entree has disappointed me here. It's definitely my favorite franchise family restaurant. MUST GO!"}
{"text":"I love this place!Food is delicious and the cheese cake is so yummy! If it is your birthday, you should tell them. They will celebrate with you in your special birthday.
I totally recommend it"}
{"text":"Today was a group lunch for a friend who is leaving. The service was fantastic - our server's name was Jolynn. The food orders were executed flawlessly and we all had a great time."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory, you get 2 stars cause, well...I'm just not a fan.  
The food wasn't great, my order wasn't correct, and our server was meh.  She kind of disappeared after our food was brought to us.  Honestly, the best part of the meal was the bread basket.  Not sayin' much there.
The Cheesecake factory menu is hugeamongous!   Yep, it is true.  They have their \"skinny\" menu which I scoff at.  Seriously just cause it is under 700 calories doesn't make it \"skinny\".  Maybe if I wanted a ginormous meal & a huge slice of cheesecake I'd like you more, but I don't.  
The place was clean.  The location is pretty.  I can't complain on the aesthetics.
If you like this sort of place, you'll probably be fine here.  This is really personal preference."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here and usually not my first pick of where to dine. (I prefer to support local business). We came here to use a gift card we got for Christmas. 
It's always very clean and tidy. We were greeted with a friendly hostess and didn't  have to wait too long. 
If you have aged eyes as I do, bring reading glasses and a light! It's dim in this place. I could hardly read the menu without assistance. Lol
I ordered a 'slimilicious' veggie salad. It sounded good, however, it had very little flavor. I had to dress it with the light salad dressing, that came on the side, just to add flavor.  It was bland. I've definitely had better. If they had grilled the veggies it would have moved it up a notch. It was boring to my tastebuds. 
My friend ordered the nachos and I will say they were pretty good. They were toasted before serving, making them very crispy and yummy.  
The restroom was relatively clean and stalls were private and well supplied. 
I'm sure I'll return though I do wish they'd come up with a gluten free low fat/sugar cheesecake. Then again......I guess cheesecake should be a deviliscious temptation"}
{"text":"My sister recently moved to the Phoenix area and I thought about taking her out to a restaurant that she has never tried.  We decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory location off Bell/83rd ave.  The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because the waiter was nice, we sat outside (on a very beautiful day), therefore the decor was to my taste.  We both ordered meatloaf dinners.  Although it was quite a bit of food, the meatloaf was burnt to a crisp (not attractive at all) and the appetizer came out AFTER the dinner.  I thought that was supposed to come out before the dinner entree.  IF I ever do return and my plate comes out burnt again, they probably won't like me very much, because I will keep sending it back until they get it right.  I still paid for my meal and tipped my waiter, but they could have done a lot better with my food."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Went there around midnight with friends after a show at playhouse square in downdown. The cheesecake selections were amazing. Luved the atmosphere and the service. Special thanks to Tevin for making it very nice for all of us. Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place. 
Thx

{"text":"Delicious food, pretty ambiance and rich flavors. As a part of our Spring Break food vacation, my daughter and I used a gift card that a friend treated me to last year. We decided to enjoy a three course lunch and split our meal because we knew we'd be too full if we had our own entree. 

Our server, Paisley checked on us a couple of times while we waded through the long menu. We had a hard time deciding so we started backwards. We chose the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. Then we ruled out steak and fish for a pasta dish. We considered the mini crab cakes, burger sliders and spring roll sampler, but after choosing the Pasta Carbonara, we decided that a lighter starter would complement the meal better.

Our server came back with warm dark wheat loaf with oatmeal and ciabatta bread with real butter. Yummy! My daughter wisely cautioned, \"Don't fill up on bread, Mom! We will have a lot of food coming.\" Our server brought fresh extra plates for us to share our salad and pasta.

The Caesar Salad was terrific. The lettuce and croutons were crisp. Our server ground fresh pepper on our salad. The dressing was spicy and made from scratch. They were also generous with the Parmesan cheese.

Our second course was the Pasta Carbonara. The chunky bacon was crisp and still had a nice bite and chew to it. It was smoky and cut through the creamy garlic Parmesan sauce that was a slight heavy on the olive oil. Still, it was super delicious. I enjoyed the green peas and the pasta was cooked beautifully al dente.

Tip: While grilled chicken could be added to either the Caesar Salad or the Pasta Carbonara, I have learned that chicken does not always enhance the flavors of these lovely dishes. I did not regret not adding chicken this time. The dressing was the star of the salad, as was the smoky bacon in the pasta.

Finally, our dreamy cheesecake came out with an extra mound of whipped cream. The raspberry ribbon was tart and refreshing. The chocolate base had a nice dark chocolaty flavor. The cake was exactly what a chilled cheesecake should be. Of course, it was dressed with fresh shavings of white chocolate.

The company was great. The restaurant was quiet enough for me to enjoy our table conversation. The food was surprisingly good especially a chain restaurant. Our server was attentive. I enjoyed my meal and would not mind repeating it soon. Our tab for our 3 course shared meal was $33. Thank you, Paisley and Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"My favorite since forever.
Has never disappointed.
Portions feed an army.
Sit outside and view all the tourists of Las Vegas that venture into the Forum Shops of
Caesar's Palace.  People watching Locale.
Of course, save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Good food but crappy service!!! We waited over an hour just to get our food!! Will not be back. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"We went there for my birthday. The bread was cold and HARD. The butter that came with the bread was not soft (almost seemed like it was just taken out of fridge). So that wasn't a very good start of the meal. The food quality was good (what I expect from Cheesecake factory). 

The worst part was when we told that bread was cold/hard and if we can get some fresh bread, they had nothing to offer. They said it was all like that. Really? Love Olive Garden and Carrabbas for their bread and service."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times. The food as we all know is alright. Nothing to go all nuts about. So..where they always win my extra star is the service. They have nailed it down. The wait is less and the waiters are on the spot. And off course the cheesecake...I used to be a big fan of them here...then..one wise day....I saw the calories in them...and rest all is history"}
{"text":"I ordered the same lunch special; except this time instead of corn, I opted for the green beans.  They had the snap I prefer for my vegetables to have; but, they were salty and oily."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this location of the cheese cake factory. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety of skinilicious selections. The food was not out of the ordinary. But the deserts were exceptional. Service was extraordinary as well. Staff was courteous and prompt. I will visit again just for the red velvet cheesecake."}
{"text":"DON'T eat here if you're vegan. 

First off, I ordered the veggie burger without cheese or mayo. My friends ordered pizza and shrimp pasta. By the time their food came out and they were done eating, my food still hadn't come out. I eventually had to just ask for them to bring my food out in a box because it was taking way too long. Additionally, my sister ordered Mac and cheese and it was never brought out. And throughout all this, the waitress never mentioned how long the food was going to take, and never apologized for the poor service. 

Then, get this. The waiter asked me if I wanted cheesecake. I kindly told her that I couldn't have dairy products and she told me she would bring me out a chocolate fudge cake. I was a bit confused if this cake was going to be vegan or not, but I let her bring it out anyways because I didn't want to make things complicated. But when she did eventually bring it out, it was covered in whipped cream. I never got much of an apology and no discount on my food, which would have made things a lot better. The whole experience just wasn't very great and I don't reccomend this location."}
{"text":"Literally took like 30 min to bring my drinks and took like another 30 to get out food order and the whole time I had to call the server over to get me a refill. The food was good but the service was ridiculous."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I have been dining at Cheesecake factory for over 12 years in various location my favorite being Marina Del Rey, Ca and the Beverly center in Los Angeles.  I am so disappointed and disgusted with the level of service and the quality of food that I experienced just recently at this location.  
1.  We sat outside near the fountain, sounds nice until you sit down to a wobbly table and bird poop all over the chairs.  When we ask for a clean chair we get another one with more bird poop.  We fix the table ourselves. While there we are repeatedly splashed w/water and as the AZ sun starts to go down BLINDED by it.  DO NOT SIT OUTSIDE the planning was unthoughtful to the diner.
2.  After we order pasta carbonara and grilled shrimp salad we wait for over 45 min.  On top of that the waitress was stingy w/bread (c'mon we were hungry) and gave us no communication about our food.  Meanwhile 6 people have sat after us, received their food and 3 left.  We ask and are told it will be out soon, NO Apologioes
3.  Food arrives...My shrimp are cold, my lettuce is wilted  and the pasta has lil sauce (my hubby always orders the same thing and this was mediocre) and is coagulated.  

We ask for a manager he reluctantly apologizes and after I say I'm not paying offers to take the food off the bill, which I felt no guilt for because we didn't eat it at all....... Thank God for the lil bread that we did get! I will never go back to this location...... Sadly I will have to dine at a \"real\" Cheesecake factory in LA where they are accustomed to the \"brand\" a bit better"}
{"text":"Definitely loved the service. Our waitress was consistently attentive and our food was really great. They were very accommodating to large parties. Great food and a great time."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time here and i have to say i am so happy they finally came to Toronto. The first time we had to wait an hour during a weekend lunch. The second time it was 40 min on a weekend brunch. My favorite is the chicken madeira and shrimp scampi combo...always soo good! I also tried a breaded chicken dish with angel hair pesto which was so so. My son got the bruleed french toast which was a disappointment as the inside was too gooey, tasted like raw batter. The brown bread is a family favorite. As for the cheesecakes, we used to always get the white choco raspberry but our new fav is the salted caramel!"}
{"text":"Had to tip my chef Mr. Robles for cooking my delicious meal because without the cooks this restaurant would not survive. Most definitely a great place to have dinner and enjoy the nice atmosphere. Spent about $86.00 on a meal for two with dessert and boy was the pumpkin pecan cheesecake also yummy."}
{"text":"My birthday dinner started out with a plate of bread and sliced bananas for my 10 month old daughter! I ate the salmon Milanese, my brother had a steak sandwich, my gma had hibachi steak, my mom had Jamaican shrimp. It was good large portions. I'd recommend the hibachi steak! We also had Mai tai!"}
{"text":"good food came here while waiting for something at the apple store
one of my monthly  favorite places to come to
fan of everything-drinks on point"}
{"text":"I was a regular fan, but somehow the food is starting to go down hill.  However the cheese is the bomb."}
{"text":"I have a Cheesecake Factory at home and I'm not all that crazy about it, but it's a sight to be seen for visitors.  The one great thing about CF is that it's consistent wherever you go.  I had the fish tacos which were just a bit too much food for me and I didn't know that they came slathered in some sort of sour cream or sauce which made them a bit less enjoyable.  Overall it was fine and definitely a good place to take picky eaters if that's what you're dealing with."}
{"text":"Could not believe how good my meal was - and reasonably priced.  Carly was a great waitress.  She was personable and had great information about the massive menu. I had lime-coconut chicken that was amazingly good. The banana cream cheesecake is worth saving room for!"}
{"text":"I love, love the food here.  The food quality is superb. However the downsides are this place is almost always loud & crowded. It is difficult to have a quiet meal here. They never take a reservation for any reason. I wish they did. Wait times; u will have a 30 minute or more wait outside the restaurant. I personally think they should offer a discount to regular customers or locals, on entrees or specialty meals. I would come more often if it werent for the high price tab. It is also very expensive to get a drink at this place. Therefore this can be an expensive date night"}
{"text":"I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times over the years. I have always loved the cheesecake. But have always been underwhelmed with the food quality. I feel the prices don't match the quality or portion size and the menu is too large. If the menu was smaller, maybe the quality of the dishes could improve as well. 
This was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory for Sunday brunch. They serve brunch until 2pm and I was excited to give it a try. 
We had a large party of 9 people so it's always hit or miss for good service. Our waiter was very personable and friendly. He was knowledgeable about the menu. I appreciated that there was a nice amount of brunch options, but not too many so as to overwhelm you. 
My husband and I both ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was cooked perfectly and had a perfect dusting of powder sugar. The chicken prepared with it was about 5 or so chicken tenders which were arranged beautifully on the plate. HOWEVER, the chicken had no seasoning on it at all. So we requested hot sauce and we were brought Tabasco sauce relatively quickly. Then, I requested a glass of water, and I never received it. This is when our service took a turn for the worse as the restaurant got more busy. My husband even asked for a refill on his coffee, and the cup was full of coffee grounds. He nicely requested another and it returned the exact same way. I'm not sure if they were out of coffee filters or what! 
So the food was okay per usual. But the service started off awesome and ended poorly as we waited quite a while for our checks. That being said, the young man seemed to be trying his best, but his section was way too large for just one server. 
For the location and atmosphere that this restaurant tries to create, they have got to do better with staffing and service in order to have repeat customers."}
{"text":"Go on a weekday, off peak time for takeout 

I waited 8 minutes for my 3 pieces of cheesecake and appetizer. 

Not bad at all :)"}
{"text":"Our family loves The Cheesecake Factory. However, this particular location taints their brand. I have come here so many times for family events and despite our hopes the service will get better it never seems to. The knowlege of our server was unacceptable.

Showed up at 4:15pm on a Wednesday. We were seated within 5 minutes for a party of 6. I went to the Restroom upon arrival and it was a mess. Also there was only 1 stall with toilet paper.

Drink orders came along and I asked oir server Tara G what they had for tequila. I was told Patron. I asked if there were other silver options and was told no, just Patron. I passed and went to the bar to order instead. Come to find out there was 4 options of silver tequila. Don Julio & Patron being the most expensive naturally. 

We wanted to order appetizer, but after recieving our drinks our waiter took too long to return to our table. We ended up just ordering our entrees.

I asked if my dish the Diane and Salmon came with asparagas and was told no, so i ordered some on the side. The dish comes out and there is asparagus with it, and a side of asparagas as well [which of course I had to pay extra for]. 

My sister ordered the chinese chicken salad. The salad came dry with no oranges.  I noticed the food runner come out and have a conversation with out waiter where they looked at the food delivered to our table. It seemed as if they realized the wrong salad was delivered, but upon us questioning it we were told no thats what you ordered. At this point we just asked for a side of dressing and oranges.

For the price and location I honestly would expect better management and training of staff."}
{"text":"I love eggplant parmigiana sandwiches... it's not on the menu but you can ask them to make it. I've had it twice here. The bread is delicious and sandwich is put together very nicely."}
{"text":"Big portions, Great food, excellent Cheesecake and beautiful decor. If you haven't been here should  definitely put it on the try list"}
{"text":"I forgot how much I like this place. I wish they didn't have so many items on the menu though. I'm horrible at deciding what to eat, and with a million choices it makes it that much harder for me. I looked at the menu for a good 20 minutes. I finally chose the bbq bacon burger. It came piled high with crispy onion rings, bbq sauce and bacon. It was deelicious! I got a side of the ranch to dip my fries into and it's the best Ranch I've ever had. It's garlicky and has a bit of a kick to it. So good. You can purchase a jar to go, FYI. My other half had the pasta carbonara with chicken and he really liked it. Others in our party had bbq chicken pizza, fettuccine alfredo, corn dogs and a club sandwich. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. 

Now you can't go to CCF and not order cheesecake. I spent another 20 mins deciding which flavor I wanted. I finally chose the oreo and it was amazing. I also got to sample the smores, reeses, and banana cream pie cheesecakes. They were all pretty good. The reeses has an over powering peanut butter flavor which I didn't really care for. The smores one was really good and the banana cream was good as well. I can't wait until they have their pumpkin cheesecake. I love that you can walk in and just purchase cheesecake by the slice without having to dine in. I will be back."}
{"text":"Usually a big fan, for a chain, I have enjoyed their wide variety of tasty food .  Not this time, the beet salad was small, dry and tasteless.  My friend had the Sangria, heavily watered down, barely a taste but  a hefty price $10.95.    The chicken pot stickers were wonderful but it ends there.  I'm VBas hoping this was a one time bad hair day."}
{"text":"Great service and our server Gregario was amazing.  We tried to stump him with items on the menu but he was able to give great detail about the items as well as page numbers."}
{"text":"Great menu and great staff. Sit inside for a quieter dining experience. I eat here often and have had only one meal and waiter that weren't that great, it's always been top notch except that one time and the Manager made it right. Great place for a long business lunch. The more experienced staff seems to also be in the back area of the restaurant. I'm a big fish eater and they have some of the best dishes in town. Pass on the Gordon Ramsay Pub and eat here instead, if you want a great meal for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times since they have been open. Every time the food is so-so, but the service is good. Today, everyone really enjoyed their food: Renee's Special, Factory Burger, Kids Mac & Cheese and Kids Pizza. The service was a little slow to get our drinks and for the food to arrive, but aside from that our server was friendly and checked on us often."}
{"text":"Went to this Cheesecake Factory on a date, and the server was very polite, although a little unkempt. I took issue with a crab dish the server recommended, it was so bland, you couldn't taste anything other than the bread shell it was enclosed in. When you added the dip to it, it made it even worse. I mentioned it to the server, who then replaced it with a crab dish which came burned to a crisp. Charcoal black, you couldn't even taste the crab. Then came dessert. I can't eat bread, so I asked the server to recommend a cheesecake which might have a little less of it. He brought a lemon raspberry cheesecake, which looked delicious, but had bread underneath the cheesecake, which again, I cannot digest. There was so little raspberry sauce, they should have just called it lemon cheesecake. I mentioned it to the server, who agreed with me, stating that wasn't the portion it should come with. I asked for more of the sauce, he disappeared, then came back and told me I'd be charged extra for it. I complained to the manager, who then told me I'd get a gift certificate for the amount of the check. Over a month has passed, and guess what, no gift certificate! I called about it to complain, and haven't gotten a call back yet. Although I will return to Cheesecake Factory again, I will never return to this particular one, or recommend it to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"I like their food,but they always forget condiments when it comes to pick up..always forget to put in the bag the butter, ketchup, ranch or other condiments I ask for"}
{"text":"If it were possible to give zero stars this Cheesecake Factory would get zero. I work in this mall and order to go all the time the people that work in this bakery and take your Togo orders are extremely rude. Myself and all the people I work with won't be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for my birthday dinner at 5pm on Saturday 9/2/17. It was busy inside but we only had to wait about ten minutes to be seated. Our server brought waters and bread right away and everything was off to a good start. The menu here is massive and I never know what to order. They have over 200 items, how can you decide?!? I finally chose the bacon-bacon cheeseburger with fries, mainly because I am obsessed with the ranch here and wanted to dip something in it. Yeah, I am a ranch freak. Side note, you can buy the ranch and all of their dressings to-go. 

So we all order and then wait for our food. I expected there to be a long wait but it was pretty quick. Everyone gets their food but my grandma. Also, I realized I got the wrong burger. When our server comes back, he apologizes and says he will get those out right away. 20 minutes later, me and grandma still have no food. Everyone else is pretty much done eating at this point. Finally our food shows up, and by this time my appetite is gone so I take everything to go. We also ordered cheesecake, because duh. I ordered the pumpkin, (seasonal) and since it was my birthday, they brought it out singing. I love being embarrassed on my birthday, said no one ever. Our server was able to get the manager to comp some of our meal, which was much appreciated. We probably won't be eating here again anytime soon, but I will be back to get some cheesecake."}
{"text":"The service was fast. Wonderful servers were constantly making sure we had enough to drink and that our dining experience at par.  I would highly suggest the key lime mango cheesecake."}
{"text":"So the first time I was considering going to this location, I was warned from my friends who work in the area that the last time they were there that they had to give some sort of warning due to a hepatitis a issue they were having...

Anyhow, onto the actual review... the food overall has been mediocre at best.  Usually something's overcooked or bland.  The service each time has been relatively good.... and the personalities tend to surface.  The second to last time I went with a friend and we had dessert.  Ordered coffee with a shot of Baileys and had a slice of cheesecake each.  Our waitress was VERY enthusiastic about the cheesecake.  To the point of us being ever so slightly uncomfortable, but she did claim to have gained tons of weight at the start of her job due to having a slice every time she worked.  I suppose if you're surrounded by it, it could happen.

Dinner wise, however, the portions are difficult to finish for the average appetite, but I tend to gravitate toward their small plates menu and order a couple of things off of that.  I also enjoy their Thai Chicken lettuce wraps.  It's a good place to go if you have a bunch of people who like a variety of things or just can't decide.

This definitely is not my choice of places to go, but usually more like a... oh, we know it's open, it's not that far, and no one is in the mood for anything specific sort of place."}
{"text":"Last time I came here I was not happy I was told I could seat any where in the bar area so me and my husband did thAn we were ask to move cause the seats on the wall in the BAR area are regular seats I guess no one said that so we went and sat at the bar I ask for a lemon drop Martini and they suck too the bartender that really can't speak English suck on making a lemon drop Martini sad part we order total of 4 drinks and one Appetizer and our bill was 85 never again will I go back they suck too ,charge too much money and can't get my drink right"}
{"text":"Took 25 minutes to get simple appetizers ( 2 house salads, and mac and cheese)
Waitress super rude and had no knowledge of menu. 
Food comes out 3 minutes after the appetizers were finally brought and tasted as if they had been under the warming light for 20 minutes . Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner so this was my first time trying brunch.  The mimosas were good.  I ordered a made to order omelette and my boyfriend ordered the French toast. My omelette was awesome.  My only complaint was the toast that accompanied it was overcooked.  The food took awhile to arrive which was disappointing.  Plus, our waitress wasn't very attentive and couldn't even bother to smile.  I was really surprised because I've visited numerous locations over the years and I've never had a bad waitress until now.  Hence, the three stars.  As we were walking out, no one bothered to say 'have a nice day'.  There were numerous hostesses just standing around.  I definitely won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Really no complaints, we arrived here at 11am and there was no wait. We got seated immediately.  Server and manager both came by table immediately being seated. Service was excellent, we had Traci, she explained a few items on the menu we were interested in and check on us through our meal.

I ordered the Mexican Chicken Lettuce Tacos, husband got the skinny Chicken Pot Pie, and our friend got the Ahi Tuna Salad. 

Only downside I encountered was the bathroom, certainly was clean but they used a very dirty mop. Left a mad smell in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of this chain and was extremely excited to enjoy the offerings closer to home rather than trekking to Buffalo. We ordered three apps, two mains, and were planning on getting cheesecake to go. 
I was beyond disappointed -- 2/3 apps were incorrect, 1/3 had contamination (blonde hair from maybe the server). I mentioned this to the server and, though she was nice, she did very little to fix the situation and we just asked for the mains instead of reordering the apps. When the mains arrived, my dish was great but my husbands was completely at room temp -- how does that even happen? We decided to cut out losses and not waste any more time (diabetic and insulin dependent..  couldn't wait any longer). We paid the bill, including the three apps that we didn't consume as well paid for his steak which also wasn't consumed. 
I'm hoping this was a one off but spending nearly $200 on wine and food that we didn't even eat... kind of seems unreasonable."}
{"text":"Very unorganized, chaotic, and very rude hostesses. One of the male hostess was talking smack to the other hostesses about my mother in front of us. The wait service and food was fine, however our time was ruined by the horrible hostess staff."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 3.5 rating if I could. This was my first time at this particular location, on a Tuesday afternoon with a friend. It wasn't busy. 

My friend and I ordered from the lunch list and the food was good. I had the spicy chipotle chicken pasta and my friend had a Parmesan-crusted salmon. We had dessert, too. I love their warm apple crisp! 

Our waitress was nice & attentive. The reason I'm giving it a 3-star rating is because this place is too expensive. The food is good but I've had better pasta at other places & didn't have to pay nearly $14 for it. I can't be the only one that thinks this, right?"}
{"text":"This review is just for the take out counter. Went in to get cheesecake that would not have nuts in it. Lovely staff were kind enough to walk me through the options. Ended up with a white chocolate blueberry cheesecake. Hit the spot."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with whatever you order at any Cheesecake Factory across the country.   The food is always consistently delicious and it's a great place to bring a group of people who may be in the mood for vastly different dishes.  My personal favorites are the mint green tea with simple syrup on the side, the Asian chicken lettuce wraps from the Light Menu, and the Ghirardelli chocolate brownie sundae!"}
{"text":"Service wonderful. Food wonderful. Outdoor seating is so enjoyable. Our waitress was attentive to us throughout our meal even with her busy dining area. Felt like eating the same meals today - that's how great it was. We will look forward to our return!!"}
{"text":"We have had many good experiences at Cheesecake Factory in Wisconsin so we decided to drop in for Happy Hour.
We were greeted by a really friendly hostess and given our choice of where we wanted to sit in the bar area.
Our waiter was Daniel and he was friendly as well and also very attentive.
I ordered Stella and my wife ordered a Cosmo.  We also ordered the Factory nachos and they were delicious.
We were still hungry so we ordered the warm apple crisp with ice cream which was huge and tasty.
We had a very good experience, their new HH menu is extensive and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"You know, I always thought you can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. Decent prices, good food, pretty big portions. My recent lunchtime visit proved me wrong. 
Everyone was seated by the bar area, right next to each other, even though there was plenty of space in the restaurant. This placed us sandwiched between parties having very loud conversations without much wiggle room. Ok, fine.

Next, my date ordered the Lemon Herb roasted chicken. I ordered the mushroom burger. When we got our meals, the chicken was different than it has been in the past. Now, instead of the actual 1/2 chicken on the bone, it was chicken pieces (mostly boneless). Turns out, they'd changed the recipe THAT DAY- and hadn't changed the description on the menu, nor had the server thought to inform us of the change. So he had his mouth set for something in particular and was pretty disappointed when it arrived. Moreover, he ordered the sautéed spinach as a side dish, and it came out dry and barely cooked. They did bring a new side of spinach, but weren't very apologetic about the chicken, just tried to convince him that the new recipe was better. 

My burger was fine, just a small slip up as I ordered a side of honey mustard that didn't come until I asked again for it. 

We did get dessert to go, and the salted caramel cheesecake was pretty good. 

Side note... the Cheesecake Factory was the only place he used his credit card that day. But the next day he got a fraud report- someone used the card info to try to make a large purchase at Cartier. Definitely suspicious. 

I don't know that i would return to this location."}
{"text":"This is by far my fav location in Arizona.  The location is awesome and the food never disappoints.  I'm a little farther away from it now but it's worth the drive.  Great food, service, and location! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great design both exterior & interior, the food is exceptional as well.  A little light on portions compared to the prices. But the biggest let down on our second visit that we experienced on both visits is the service. Once were sat we saw no server for over five minutes. Then it took him five more to go grab three sodas, we asked for an app about 8 minutes later he asked for our entree order still no app about ten minutes go by he drops off bread and butter 15 minutes after that a runner dropped off our app and standing right behind her was a very rude food runner with our entrees, we said we just got our app!  her reply \" i can take it back and let it sit till your ready for it\" as rude as it can be said.  So bottom line cheesecake you got a good product now you just need to work on having the staff that can handle such a large location in a kind, prompt manner!!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here a few weeks ago and for $100 I'm not impressed at all. I was expecting better food for the price range. Our service was fantastic and the restaurant was nice but the food was a let down. Definitely not on the list of places I would return to."}
{"text":"I'm not big on chains but if you're going to go to a chain, I don't know of a better one to visit. The Salmon Genovese was delicious. And the service had been very good both times I've been to this location. Note the parking is free in the parking deck but not on the 'street' or in the back lot closest to the restaurant."}
{"text":"My experience at this place was not so good. I came on a busy Saturday night. Apparently the waitress forgot that I ordered a Macaroni Burger. By the time I got the burger, everyone I came with was done eating and ready to go home. I wasn't even hungry anymore."}
{"text":"We came to the cheesecake factory to celebrate a birthday and enjoy a nice family dinner. Our reservation was accurate and they had our table ready upon arrival. The service was good as was the food. Thr waitress suggested eggplant Parmesan which was good and to be honest I've never seen it on the 15 page menu that they have. We enjoyed one slice of shared red velvet cheesecake which was delicious as well as take-home cheesecakes which were equally as good. The Asian lettuce wrap tacos are always a good lite choice and if you're here on the day when they have the chicken artichoke soup I would highly suggest getting a cup.  It is one of the most delicious soups I've ever had!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant. The service was very very slow it took forever to get water, bread, our order taken, and well anything. I ordered the cheeseburger egg rolls and the pear and Bleu cheese flat bread. Everything was fine until I bit into my third egg roll and found a hair sticking out of it... I wanted to throw up. The one saving grace about the whole experience was the manager was very polite and apologized tremendously for the hair in my food. He also took both items off of my bill. I will not be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory ever."}
{"text":"I've visited this Cheesecake Factory on several occasions and really shocked to see I haven't reviewed yet so, here goes...

This location is situated smack dab in the middle of Southside Works and has a classy kinda feel to it. It's beautiful inside and I love how some of the seating is very intimate. The service here is always great which leads me to believe whoever is running this one knows what they are doing and they're employees are happy...it shows. 

The food was soooo good. My order of chicken piccata had that burst of fresh lemon and caper sauce with a side of angel hair. The chicken was moist and tender and absorbed the light sauce well.

On a final note, get here early on a Saturday night because the wait is LONG. No reservations are accepted on the weekends. With that said, if you have good company to keep your attention, the wait is a non-issue :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed. First time I've ever had a martini served in a glass tumbler. Said no martini glasses available?  It was warm so was sent back. At $12 not acceptable."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY - Sunday Brunch was so delicious yesterday!  The lemon ricotta pancakes were some of the best we've had in quite some time.  My lovely partner has been jonesing for those for quite some time and we finally found the scratch for her itch.  My spinach, bacon and roasted tomato eggs benedict was very tasty - nothing too out there but overly enjoyable.

The munchkin went with fried calamari for an appetizer (shared by all, though we couldn't finish it - soooo big!) and then had the bacon bacon burger (sans cheese or sauce).  The bacon on this burger, though - TO. DIE. FOR.  I'm totally going back to the Cheesecake Factory soon JUST for that burger.  With cheese.  And sauce.  Because that's how I live."}
{"text":"Last time we came was 3.5 hour wait but this time was 45 minutes! Loved everything, food was great, the nachos were AMAZING! We got the lemon raspberry and the salted caramel cheesecake. But, our waiter barely came to our table to check up on us and was not organized. I think that is due to the fact that they were understaffed. I still love the Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Huge menu leaves something for everyone.  Prices can get up there, even for seemingly simple dishes. The good thing is that most items (even salads and sandwiches) will get you multiple servings unless you're super hungry. I'm a fan of their rye bread. People think I'm weird when I compare other calamari to the one that's served here.  That said, I wonder how much of the food is actually prepared fresh from scratch. A lot of the dishes are drenched in salt. My friend couldn't eat his pasta because it was so salty.  Service was slow and \"meh\" at best. Cheesecake is good for its convenience and familiarity. In the future, I'd rather spend the same money or less at a local restaurant."}
{"text":"We were traveling and found Cheesecake Factory by accident and decided to have lunch. I'm a big fan of it in Chicago but was disappointed on this one. My husband ordered the cheesesteak sandwich and when he took a bite the meat was pink and still raw. We called the waitress and when we told her about it she laughed and offered to get him something else. He declined due to the fact he was grossed out. I ordered the burrito grande and it was good but it was filled with a lot of rice and very little chicken. For the prices we have to pay to eat here I expect high quality food and service."}
{"text":"Yes; this place is 100% hype. But I definitely approached The Cheesecake Factory with zero expectations and as someone who has never experienced it before. I was glad I didn't have to wait more than 10mins on a Friday afternoon during lunch which contrasted the hour long waits that had happened during opening month. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was good and fried perfectly. But the sauces that came with it were another story; a terrible store-bought cocktail sauce and an overly creamy garlic dip that tasted like mayo and a bit of diced garlic. Terrible. Our entrees - fettuccine alfredo and fish tacos - continued to disappoint. The alfredo was absurdly salty and has a chunky texture that I couldn't stomach. The will flavour of that dish was salt. The fried fish in the tacos was good, but the topping were lacking and the spicy aioli had a similar texture to the calamari dip which was terrible. To be honest, the only real redeeming thing is the cheesecake. We had gotten the raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake which was honestly really good! The housemade cream on top was good and the raspberry flavour was prominent but didn't overwhelm the white chocolate. 

Overall, I get the hype but I don't. It's nice when new establishments from the US reach Canada, but don't let that be the end all of whether an establishment is good. My review gets worse cause I got straight up food poisoning after my visit. Maybe it was just my immune system, but maybe it was the food. Service was great; super friendly! But my impression on the Cheesecake Factory is low due to the mediocre food at relatively higher prices, and for not a super amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"We had the best server ever.
I wish to GodI could remember his name. I think it was Ryan.
WE got there on Easter Sunday night...
The place was empty.
Our food was AWESOME.
Our service was AWESOME. SUPER Attentive!
I went home full and happy!
Would certainly return!"}
{"text":"I love this place . The food is always good and who can say NO to cheescake :) . I like best is the service . Knowlegable staff and very resourceful . The location is fantastic .  For more info ... Read Kristen 's review . She hit it right on ."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was why I gave this experience a 2 star rating. I had ordered a chopped salad which was supposed to come with grilled chicken. I didn't notice the chicken was missing until I was half done but once I could get the attention of our server, I informed him and told him I was almost done so I didn't want the chicken. He advised he would \"pass it along to management\". I guess I was expecting to see the manager, or a discount on my tab or some sort of adjustment. But nothing. Not a sorry about that, not a nothing. I'm not even sure he mentioned it to his manager. In hindsight, I guess I should have docked his tip, but I didn't. Maybe my standards are too high and I expect too much but I would have liked to have seen better customer service in some way or another."}
{"text":"Just like with all cheesecake factory, prepare to wait a LONG time to be seated and to actually eat. We were there with a large party to celebrate my uncle's bday. It doesnt make any sense for restaurants not to take in reservation on weekends for large party. Anyway we got there a little after 6pm and waited an hour to be seated. Once seated, we waited another 30mins or maybe more to get our food. Kudos to our server for (1) getting all 12 orders right and (2) providing excellent service to all of us.   I can't complain about our food as we all liked our food."}
{"text":"Went there for a slice of cheesecake with my daughter. The place was packed on an early Sunday afternoon. Had to wait for around 20 min to be seated. Our server was Tiffany and she was very attentive and helpful. I had cappuccino and that was excellent. My actual Tiramisu Cake was really good and big enough to share. My daughter Oreo milkshake was good but oh, sooo sweet, she couldn't finish it. She had Dulce De Leche Cheesecake, and that for us tasted ok, but not really impressive. A little overpriced."}
{"text":"Great service as usual. TCF is one of the only restaurant chains that has good service no matter the location. They make dining options easy for me when I'm somewhere unfamiliar. 

Caribbean Cooler 10.95
Strawberry Lemonade 4.95
Tomato Basil Pasta 14.50
Fish Tacos 13.95
Caramel Macadamia cheesecake 7.50

51.85 pls tax"}
{"text":"The food and service was exceptional. Our server Amanda was the best! She would get us refills on drinks and bread before we even had to ask. She was super nice and everything got to us quickly. I love the food here there are plenty of choices. I personally enjoyed the Miso Salmon. Also you can't leave without getting a slice of cheesecake while you are here. I would recommend the Craigs Crazy Carrot Cheesecake, it was yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Our \"go-to\" lunch spot for a great quick lunch. We love coming in at 11am, right when they open because it's quiet and we receive fast service. We love the green tea with mint. I get the Caesar add shrimp or the Cobb no chicken, extra bacon. Both are always delicious and very filling with generous portions for the lunch size. The menu is vast and has a ton of great options that vary in type of cuisine. The complimentary bread & butter is a great bonus and must have. I prefer the pumpernickel and my husband prefers the sourdough, what a perfect pair! Overall, a great lunch with a variety of options!"}
{"text":"My first visit at a Cheesecake Factory was somewhere near Gaithersburg, MD years ago. I thought is was the best thing since texas toast so when they started cropping up here, I was excited. Stopped by for dinner the other night and just wasn't impressed. Our waitress was extremely nice but the food...just meh. What happened? Maybe it's the steak and shrimp combo I ordered? Maybe I just do cheesecake next time?  I'll give them another try in a few months and update my review."}
{"text":"Where do I start off? Luckily skipped that horrendous line up that wraps around Victoria secret just to get that buzzer and your name down. 

We got sat down at the booths near the mall entrance ( try not to sit there because it's freezing cold cause of the mall entrance door) 

Problem is they seated us fast, however have awfully lazy servers who never checked up on our table, and our food took 1hour to come!!!

We ordered the Topical blended drinknwith raspberry swirl, Nashville  bites, Pizza Parmigana with angel hair pasta, Orange chicken ( for fun) and the Spicy Chicken and Shrimp Cajun pasta. 

Now these are all dishes we enjoy very much in the USA. And find delicious and well balanced flavours. 

However at Cheesecake in Canada, our rules, regulations and safety standard's definitly tweaked the taste ... and not in a good way! The meat all tasted like a Tofu substitute or maybe 30% meat and rest filler. The Pizza Style Parmigana is supposed to be chopped up and seasoned chicken breast. Like I said it tasted like seasoned tofu or processed fake chicken meats! Didn't expect that with Canada's high food standards. 

The food was all SALT salt salt. But not no sugar to create the blissful perfection of sweet and savoury ( which is for sure the reasons why we eat out ! Seasoning) 

So salty we couldn't stomach It, and packed up to go containers. 

Getting back to the sad part of waiting 1 hour to received our food, while watchinf others getting their mains, who had arrived before us . There were others in the same or worse boat than us ! Waiting 2 hours for their food. 

Now this is where it gets good, the Cajun pasta, changed the seasoning from the USA one added more salt and less Cayenne and Paprika. The seasoning wasn't spicy like usual. This dish is the reason why my husband and I are on the toilet and sick!!! Very disappointed in the standards and how this restaurant was run. No good first impressions here. 

The staff were dismissive when complaints were made by us, snickering and gossiping about customers at their attendent station, and management was so flustered they forgot why they are even at our table. I watched endlessly as our experience also was what everyone else felt too in our section ! 

The management blamed our one dish as the reason the rest of food was late, however it happened to be the coldest thing we got lol.... 

Anyways I have said enough. I understand it will never be the same as USA. But it isn't even close to reaching the first hurdle in service, quality and taste. ! I dont recommend this or even wasting time waiting. Your better off hopping over to Buffalo and having it where it's made right !! 


Seriously disappointed at this opening of an amazing Chain but ONLY when you eat in the USA. 

Good luck everyone with your journey to Cheese cake Factory !"}
{"text":"Service is great the server was very friendly. However the food is not up to par as other Cheesecake Factory locations that I have tried. I was disappointed in the quality of food. They get 3 stars one for the server, one for the hostess and one for the backup singers who sang happy birthday to my mom. Great personalities but that cannot justify coming back here to eat. Great food makes me want to come back and my taste buds need to be tantalized in order for me to give a 4 star and up rating."}
{"text":"Post Cleveland air show visit. We have a gift card and it's probably a good thing As I would be disappointed paying these prices for this food. 

Our appetizer of pork rolls and avocado fries were solid. Our sauces were small in quality and flavor. It was fresh and hot so at least that was good. It was also a improvement over the last time we came here when everything was cold.

My sausage and shrimp pasta. Cold penne I asked them to warm it up, when in reality they just shook it up and stirred it. I like my food hot, also the shrimp wasn't cooked long enough. My sausage was more mixed into the sauce in small chucks. Just not worth anywhere near 17 dollars, with a all the choices in this area. I realize your busy and understaffed but please serve me warm food.

Jen got a steak w mushrooms and onions. Again for 20 bucks serve quality Flavor, this tasted like a low end overcooked steak. The asparagus w it w a breading was gross and had a weird texture to it, it was also served cold. Please use food runners. 

Also the cheese cake is not as good as a place in our area(warren,Ohio) the local coffee shop mocha house crushes the Cheesecake Factory and it's over stated Big Bang references."}
{"text":"The dish I ordered was delicious but then again a bit bland in regard to the seasoning. I ordered the chicken Alfredo with shrimp."}
{"text":"The infamous CheeseCake factory ahhhh well the Service was great the waiter was very delightful. But the pasta plates that my party of 6 ordered were very dry and undercooked. Not a professional review"}
{"text":"OK, so, sometimes the stars just line up right.  My wife and I had a great experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Lyndhurst, OH.  

We pulled in to the parking lot that looked more like a beehive at rush hour.  In our 1st pass a choice spot is staring at us mockingly (thinking there's certainly a wheelchair symbol adorning it).  Nope, we pulled right in.  Now we're 50ft from the door and already wondering what the \"little people\" are doing.  

The mass of patrons was akin to Black Monday on the floor of the NYSE waiting to get the little flashy \"you got a table\" doohickeys.  We get our doohickey after a few flying elbows and head to the bar.  Again the place is packed.  Startlingly and without explanation the bartender gets MY attention to get our drink order.  Huh?  Do they think I'm Michael Jordan (only a tad shorter with a melanin deficiency)?  No sooner do our martinis hit our lips a table becomes available right behind us.  Our waiter, Dan, tells us we can pop a squat right here for dinner instead of waiting out our assigned 45min doohickey Purgatory.  Assuming this is some sort of cruel joke, we sit anyway.

We experience one of the best orders of calamari in our vaunted calamari eating careers.  Our dinner orders were taken swiftly and arrived in a timely fashion.  For the 1st time ever I asked for a take-out box because I wanted to re-experience my dinner (Caramel Chicken) yet again tomorrow.  

Our server, Dan, allowed us the right amount of privacy and attentiveness making the whole experience that much better.  Since we were stuffed to the gills, we opted to take our cheesecake to go.

I can't promise the same experience if you go to The Cheesecake Factory.  But now I know it's at least possible!

P.S.  Thank you Jim and Michelle for the gift card."}
{"text":"The location is perfect, celebrated a birthday luncheon with a few co-workers and had the Miso Salmon plate with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed brocolli it was fresh, healthy and very tasty not to mention the strawberry cheesecake for desert. All four of us enjoyed our meal for less than $100. The service was excellent, no wait time and everyone is very curteous. We then strolled around the district before returning to work. This turned into a wonderful afternoon."}
{"text":"I've never had not so great food here. But, the food isn't the most amazing food I've ever had either. But, it's a great fall back place to go to when I don't know where else I want to eat. Or, it's a great place to meet friends. Prices are pretty decent, and service has always been good to me. 

I'd have to say, that the calamari is by far my favorite thing o order. I just love the white sauce that comes with it. The breading on the calamari is always so nice and light, and always crispy. 

Secondly, I would highly suggest the Chicken Madeira. Plus, it's such a huge portion, theres usually some left overs !!"}
{"text":"So we hit up Cheesecake Factory since we were in town for the Olympia, and my friend Branka had competed for the first time in the most prestigious bodybuilding event in the world and was starving for cheesecake.  Branka and I got four cheesecakes in total: Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, Ultimate Red Velvet, Original and a Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake.  I had the Kahlua one and it was so rich I couldn't finish it!

Our waiter was fantastic too - Shawn R and was pleasant, on top of things and really friendly.  Definitely was a good way to cap an intense weekend!"}
{"text":"It was so nice to be able to sit down and enjoy a meal in between outlet shopping. I believe the prices are the same here and the portions are large as usual. They also have many lunch specials available here but they definitely aren't cheap. We got the lunch size bistro shrimp pasta and the Asian lettuce tacos, which were both delicious. They also have a skinny menu with lower calorie dishes available. Most of their cheesecakes are amazing and large enough to share, just depends what flavor you're in the mood for. Service was a bit slow since we went during lunch time, so I wouldn't recommend coming if you were in a rush."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night and had a great time, the atmosphere was very nice and inviting. Our waitress was very fast and knowledgeable of the menu and knew what she was doing. While the service was great, the food left a little to be desired.

We started with the crab and artichoke dip. This was served with buttered pieces of toast. The dip was just drowning in oils and grease. It was like dipping grease into grease, not very good in my opinion.

For our main corse I ordered the chicken madeira. For being the most famous dish, it was not really what I had my expectations set for. It was a great dish none the less and was prepaired flawlessly. The chef plated it very beautifully aswell. 

My fiancé ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combination. Again the presentation was very beautiful and the only critic she had was that the scampi was a bit tangy for her taste.

For desert we ordered the tiramisu and lemon meringue cheesecake to go, both were very good.

We will be coming back here forsure, it was totally worth what we had spent and the items left us very curious about other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I work in the forum shops, and my coworkers and I always go here to eat on our lunches. Usually the associates at the cash register are very friendly and accommodating, but Tiffany s was far from it. I asked for a side of marinara for my bread, and was charged 3.95 for a half cup of marinara. I have never been charged before for this. I called two hours ahead of time to have it ready at 10pm for my lunch. I got there at 9:59 and then waited 6 minutes for my food. Once I walked back to my store, it was cold! I asked her why I was being charged 4.00 for a small side of marinara and she asked if I wanted to speak with a manager but since I had already waited 6 minutes for my food, I didn't have time. This establishment lacks consistency. She was rude and inconsiderate and I think I may just start packing lunches instead of taking business to Cheesecake Factory. I don't like being ripped off!"}
{"text":"Never been b4 but I'm going back for sure.  Great prices even in Lost Wages, I mean Las Vegas.  4 ate dinner with desert and one cocktail and it was 80 bucks and change.  The menu selection is outta control.  Too much to choose from IMO.  Service was very good and the cob I had was one of the better I've experienced. The fresh lemonade was excellent with a sugar rim and the lemon drop good sized and very tasty too."}
{"text":"It's a franchise chain so I don't know why I wrote this. The Yelp Gods summoned me to do so. The food is okay since they serve it over a hundred times a day, especially with sauces and dressings that are too salty but the bread is always good. But I did have to ask for water twice. The server was polite.  It is what it is at this particular Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I suggest not ordering 'To Go'...didn't want to wait an hour for a table on a Saturday night, so we decided to order and pick up. Every single time I order for pick up at this location they get my order wrong or forget something:/ Tonight they forgot the fries to my daughter's kids meal and got my order wrong.. I ordered the teriyaki chicken with brown rice but with boneless chicken breasts instead of the bone in. The rice was undercooked and still hard and they gave me the bone in chicken.. I know they are busy, but if I'm paying $100 including tip for our meal, it should be right."}
{"text":"My wife and I continually come here for any occasion.  Whether brunch, dinner, or just dessert, the Summerlin (Rampart) location always provides good service and food.  Keep in mind, we have visited their restaurants in Boston, MA, Waikiki, HI, and Santa Monica, CA and their customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at. I've never had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Even though they have a vast selection to choose from in the enormous menu, everything is always delicious. My favorite plate is the jambalaya cajun pasta and for dessert, the turtle cheesecake along with the raspberry lemonade. 

Whether you're just having brunch or celebrating a special occasion, they're perfect for anytime. Their service is always spot on."}
{"text":"I tried cheesecake factory twice in US and I loved it but their toronto branch sucks you have to wait two hours for them to prepare a table for you and then the game is starting when the waitress keep asking you what can I get for you ,yesterday I gave this restaurant another try despite of their rude waitress who gave us hard time in my last visit ,and after two hours of waiting when my pager finally vibrated they gave me a table of two in which I asked for a table of three when I told them I'm looking for table for three they gave me another pager and said you have to wait another hour and I asked for manager advice she just repeated the script snd I told her I have a reservation for three you have to check it out and find me a table and she finally realized it was their mistake and asked me to wait until they find me a table , finally they gave us a table and the rude waitress Meriam kept gave us a attitude and kept asking what can I get for you ,she brought an already open bottle of wine and pour more than 1/3 bottle in each glass which is not professional at all they have to let you taste the bottle before pouring it and this lady really ruined our Friday night with her attitude.if you like cheesecake factory try it in US or take out the food to not interacting with all these rude people."}
{"text":"I  prefer non- chain restaurants and haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in six years, but amazingly the same menu items that I chose then were still on the menu. I got a Caesar salad with fried chicken and hubby got a buffalo burger ! Colleagues got a pasta dish, salmon dish, and chicken dish and all plates were consumed happily. Since we are all away from home we splurged on cheesecake too! TCF is typical and reliable. See you in another six years."}
{"text":"Horrible experience never again are we dining at this location. Got orders all wrong . Wait time was horrible we didn't mind since we knew this was a popular place . Regardless the wait time service was just horrible . Never again"}
{"text":"Located in the Caesar Forum, you have to walk through the whole thing to find this place -- tucked in on the side, and packed with people.

The menu is HUGE. I had never been before at any other location, and i was mesmerized by the size of the menu and how many calories each dish contained. Eff it, I was on vacation.

The lady and I started with toasted avocado bread, which is what it sounds like: toasted bread topped with avocada. It was actually pretty good, and is a good hangover cure if you're not feeling too hot.

For our lunches we each ordered salads. It was called the chicken avocada salad or something similar, and it was a LARGE salad. One of the biggest i have eaten in my life, actually. It was covered in guac, chicken, black beans, tortilla strips, corn... just a lot of stuff packed in, and I could barely even finish it. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita. Recommended.

Service was good, Our waiter enjoyed talking to us about where we were from and what we had planned while in Vegas. If you're in the area or walking around Caesar's and want some grub or booze, this is a solid option."}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory so don't get me wrong as this review is totally about this experience. I have been a regular customer to the Cheesecake Factory in Kansas. However this Charlotte one was my first experience.

I didn't mind waiting for 1 hr 15 mins and didn't mind the fading lights. Lights were very dim to read the menu comfortably but I didn't mind as I knew what I wanted to order. I always start with Avocado egg rolls as they are my favorite. However they weren't as crispy as I have had them earlier, it seemed they were sitting on the kitchen counter for around 10 mins after being fried. Which resulted in the lack of crispness. 

For the entree I wished to try a new item, the ratatouille toast. The presentation was beautiful and appetizing. The ratatouille was delightful however the toast was burnt and very dry. It was hard to eat but thinking about my prior experience with Cheesecake Factory I gave it a go hoping that the next piece would be better. But I realized it was hopeless cause. This was reported to the manager and he offered to replace it but by then I just lost my appetite. He took it off the bill which was a kind gesture. I wouldn't have mind paying for it as its all about the having a good experience.

For desserts it was lemoncello cream torte, which is a masterpiece. Refreshing lemon mascarpone cheese sandwiched between moist vanilla cake topped with streusel."}
{"text":"It has been two years since we have been to the restaurant.  Normally  the lines are too long . We got there and the front area was packed but the lines moved quickly. I was pleasantly surprised . It appears that several parties may have left or went shopping.  The bread was good and  scarfed it down quickly.  The portions are huge , enough for two . Our server brought us plates for the bread that were dirty except for the top plate. We ordered the spicy cashew chicken,  this tasked like a cheap version of orange chicken . It was extremely salty and deep fried. . I don't recall getting any cashews. We also ordered Asian salad. It was drenched with salad dressing which was too salty we had the jambalaya chicken and shrimp which we liked but they must have forgotten the sauce. I wanted to order cheese cake but was stuffed"}
{"text":"large menu, good service, food is good, Usually a long wait for lunch or dinner, place is very loud."}
{"text":"Every time I visit The Cheesecake Factory, I never have a bad experience!  The service is always good, the food is ALWAYS awesome, and the general atmosphere is nice.

The one bad experience I had here was ordering the filet mignon.  I am not a rare kind of person and it kept coming out pink even when I told them they could butterfly it.  It took three times but they FINALLY got it right and the manager even came out and apologized profusely.  You know, things like this happen at restaurants.  While I wasn't excited about it, I took it in stride because it was a very busy Saturday night and every other time I have been here (~dozen) has been great.

What to order: Grilled salmon with spinach, spicy cashew chicken, Kobe beef burger (delish!), tuna tartare, Asian pear martini, pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal makes me cry).  Their menu is so expansive that there are a million things to try, and a million ways to customize each order.

P.S. Be prepared to wait if you go on a Friday/Saturday night unless you make reservations.  It is SUPER packed!"}
{"text":"Below average food! Ordered buffalo blast and stuffed mushroom. Terrible! The buffalo blast - such a waste of dish and presentation. The mushrooms had cheese that had dried up!
Raspberry cheesecake- not great either. The syrup tasted like - cough syrup !
Sorry to say but Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite restaurant no matter where I'm at! Today I tried the Godiva cheesecake and OMG! It was as amazing as it sounds!"}
{"text":"Just finished having an early dinner. The server was one of the most inattentive and rude waitresses I've ever had. Food was ok, wine had an insect floating in it, bread came 20 minutes after we sat down and the coffee cup was taken to the back and refilled and brought back to the table."}
{"text":"I'm definitely happy they came to Canada. Be prepared there will be a long wait at certain times. I would suggest that anyone that has never been to a Cheesecake Factory in the U.S., PLEASE wait until the lines have died down to visit. It's really unfortunate that they are getting poor reviews from people who decided THIS was the best time to try it out. They met all my expectations as someone who has dined at locations in the US repeatedly. Flavours are on par. Customer Service was great."}
{"text":"I took my family of four here this past Sunday for lunch.  The best part was the fancy building, but that's about it.  My wife ordered french toast. She didn't like it...too much bread and lacking in flavor.  My son ordered a Belgian waffle and liked it.  I ordered hot wings from the appetizer menu.  I would say they were ok. Nothing special...a little dry and not very spicy.  My daughter ordered steak Diane.  She was disappointed....3 shrimp, sticky mashed potatoes, and small portion of steak pieces, many of the pieces under-cooked.  The waitress seemed as if she had too many tables to cover.  We rarely saw her and she really wasn't that pleasant.  After the meal was served by kitchen staff, nobody came around to ask how things were.  The icing on the cake for me was when my wife and daughter wanted Oreo milkshakes to-go.  Took an extra 15 minutes and they were brought to us in cheap little plastic cups.  They seemed like they had sat for a while and had started to melt a little.  When the bill came, I was shocked to see a $95 dollar bill.....way too much for what we ordered!  The only expensive meal was my daughter's steak at $22.  Each of the pathetic milkshakes was $8.  Seriously?  My wife and son each had what I would call a cheap breakfast.  This meal should have cost no more than $50 at most.  I paid the bill and we proceeded to drive home.  The more I drove, the more upset my wife and I became.  I hate wasting money...which is exactly what I did.  My wife said that I should drive back and tell someone, but I declined.  I wasn't optimistic that management would care.  My family felt bad.  I told them that they are worth $100, but the meal I just paid for was certainly not.  I guess that YELP is my way to vent a little.  I told my family that next time, we should just go to Denny's if they're going to order simple breakfast items and I'll save $60.  I'm still angry about paying almost $20 for two puny milkshakes.  That's absurd!  I object to paying a premium price for sub-par service and mediocre-level food.  I still haven't decided if I will ever be back.  I'm pretty frustrated right now."}
{"text":"The Louisiana Pasta left a lot to be desired, but the banana cheesecake more than made up for it."}
{"text":"An overpriced meal from chef Mike (Microwave). We had a the fried cheese, and stuffed mushroom appetizers. Then a club sandwich and french dip for entrees. And we each snagged a piece of cheesecake togo (Strawberry and dulce de leche).

Positives:
 - My wife enjoyed her Strawberry cheesecake
 - We wound up being two people at a booth meant for six. Was kinda nice having a bit more personal space, considering how crowded and busy the place was.

Negatives:
 - Bit of a wait to get seated (25-30 min), but it was busy so I can't fault them for that. However I had a follow-up question after talking to the hostess and she decided to talk to a waiter about his day for 15 minutes instead of turn her head and help answer my question. Luckily a waitress came by and helped me out.
 - The place was packed and the seating is done in such a way that made me feel like I was one sardine in a can. The big booth we got seated in helped out, but it was unfortunately right next to a server station, so the traffic right outside my booth was fast and plenty. Getting seated and leaving that spot made me feel like a cyclist in L.A. traffic.
 - The appetizers were microwave meals. The mushrooms were a rubbery, bland, solid mass. The fried cheese was bland and the marinara dipping sauce was watery soup.
 - The club was a bland stack covered in miracle whip.
 - The french dip came with a shot glass amount of dip and the beef was about as low grade as you could get. Tearing threw the fat and sinew with my teeth turned my meal into a challenge.
 - The fries had no seasoning and came to us about 15 minutes after our entrees got there.
 - My dulce de leche cheesecake was a bit of a sad, bland mess as well.

If you think about it, when you boast over 250 menu items, how would you expect a chef to be able to keep fresh, quality ingredients for every one of those around, as well as be able to hone and refine every one of those dishes? I believe you can't, which worsens an experience that their layout already makes dismal.

I'm looking forward to avoiding this place like the plague in the future."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Cheesecake Factory but tonight I have to drop one star because the hostess that sat us was not very pleasant. She rushed to seat us did not say anything after we were seated and just left right away. She looked like she was not happy to be there."}
{"text":"I enjoy dining at many of The Cheesecake Factory locations. I have tried many different appetizers and entrees and have yet to be disappointed. My alcohol infused drink was quite tasty, my skinnyliciuos chicken tacos were fresh and flavorful, and the Chris Cheesecake was delicious! I will agree with some of the reviewer's that the wait can be long and tiresome on a Saturday night. But you have to consider the amount of patrons and the establishment is not that big. I wouldn't necessarily say it was not worth the wait. And as another poster mentioned \"Applebee's crowd\" that pretentious a-hole should take his business elsewhere. I read of a decent, good and kind hearted man who is known and loved by many to this day who never judged and would not judge people, his initials are J.C. Maybe some of you know him, doubt the pretentious poster does."}
{"text":"Delicious as always! We were seated quickly but had to wait a bit on our food and they rush hadn't even hit yet. Our server didn't seem to happy to be there but I've had worse servers, she was attentive. I'd visit again if in the area. If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory the nachos and Chris's outrageous cheesecake are a must!!!"}
{"text":"Food can be decent but when we go to pick up it takes longer to get through the line and order than to actually cook the food.  What is frustrating is that there seems to be groups of employees standing around while people wait to order 

Having worked in restaurants much of my life I would just urge them to use their resources a bit more efficiently"}
{"text":"THANK YOU SO MUCH ALICIA 
First time at this Cheesecake Factory, amazing customer service. Food was hot when we got it. Kept us with  our cup full of water, she would come and check up on us often. 
We are going home with our celebration cheese cake, thanks Alicia for the recommendation. 
Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to going to the Cheesecake Factory because we do not have one anywhere close to Albuquerque, NM.  I did not go to this particular location on 27th, but did go to the one in Ross Park Mall.  What a MAJOR disappointment.  The food was WAY TO expensive, not tasty at all, and the service was the slowest I have ever experienced.  2 1/2 hrs. in a restaurant to eat a burger and piece of cheesecake is ridiculous.  Also, I did not think the cheesecake was all that great for $8 a slice. PLEASE DO NOT COME TO ALBUQUERQUE."}
{"text":"Ordered Bang Bang Shrimp dish for lunch.  For $20 I expected more.  5 Shrimp, and 4 chunks of chicken over pasta.  It lacked the bang bang flavor.  Still good, but expected more for the price."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is a solid choice, and you pretty much know what you're getting when you go.  Mom and I visited on a Monday evening- no wait, seated right away.  Service wasn't particularly friendly, and I did have a wait for a refill, but it was adequate.  As always, there is a huge menu with lots of choices and large portions.  My meal (Bistro Shrimp Pasta) was a bit underseasoned, almost bland, but did the trick.  As always, the cheesecakes are the stars, and the Red Velvet Cheesecake was delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered burgers from there tonight just to get something different for a change, amazing meat cooked as per ordered,great service, I have to say they di burgers as good as anyone else if not better! Kobe and chop house!!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 8 during their pre-opening. This was my first time going to the Cheesecake factory as I have never had the opportunity to go in the states. I literally thought they only sold cheesecakes but boy was I wrong. They apparently have over 200 items on the menu but that wasn't available to us during the pre-opening experience. The food portions are ginormous and very tasty. We tried 1 appetizer , 4 entrees and 2 slices of cheese cake. I must say the value is great, the atmosphere was very welcoming, friendly. I lovely how this is conveniently located in Yorkdale mall as I can see this being a huge hotspot.. I hope they will be taking reservations as I can see people from all over coming to experience it. Overall I am very satisfied with the service, the value, portions, options and atmosphere! Will definitely be returning here quite often and recommending it to everyone."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant after work. The server was nice, but the overall service was sub par. I ordered two of the most basic items from the menu and my food wasn't hot the 1st or 2nd time it came out. I think my server Jenee must have had too many people. Then my salad had 4 small cubes of beets, 4 cubes of goat cheese, and a whole asparagus cut into small pieces (count them if you ever get the salad) so basically, I had a bad of lettuce. I figured this must be the limit so I ask for more toppings or I'd take it back. (With all of the great restaurants coming to the area, you can't afford to skimp in ingredients, and take away from the quality). The manager pretty much said that he would take it off as I'm leaving without eating. So of course he would, I didn't eat it. I had the chance to go to Yafo Mediterranean Kitchen, a new restaurant down the street, but it was too late. Cheesecake Factory is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a chain restaurant in quite some time- and now I remember why. First, I must say, I was only here because it was a friend's birthday lunch and it was her pick. 
When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we didn't mind waiting, so we put our name in and sat down. About two minutes later our party was called, which was perplexing since there were many many people waiting, all of which had arrived before we did. I'm not exactly sure how that happened, but we weren't about to complain about a shorter than expected wait time. 
We were seated in a booth in the corner, and then we waited. After about 5 minutes of no one greeting us, some in my party started glancing around wondering where the server might be. Having working in the food industry throughout college, I reminded everyone that they were extremely busy and our server was probably doing the best he could. But after about 10 more minutes with not even an \"I'll be right with you\" I couldn't even justify what was taking so long.
Finally our server did arrive, said nothing about the wait, and took our drink order. He was friendly and informative and did make some recommendations. A few of us ordered cocktails and we put in an appetizer because we were afraid of waiting again. 
Alas, we waited again. Drinks took about 10 minutes. Bread took an additional 10. Then our server was back, and he was grumpy. He snapped at us, he was short, and he seemed genuinely irritated. When he brought us a drink refill, he didn't even hand it to the right person, he just slammed it down on the table. Maybe something happened at another table? I get it. But it was very uncomfortable. 
Then out of nowhere, our entrees arrived! But where was the appetizer we had put in long before?? Apparently we weren't getting that. And our server never came back to check on is, so we were never able to bring it to his attention. 
Our entrees are what you'd expect from a chain restaurant, generic, unoriginal, no excitement. The food is overpriced for what you actually receive, but again that's what you get when they need to hike up the prices to make a profit for their corporation. 
Our bills were dropped off and I saw I was charged $10.50 for the watery, I think they forgot the alcohol mojito that I ordered. But what did I expect really? 
Just an affirmation to why I forgo chains altogether. I honestly can't wait until restaurant groups like this are done for."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only (I cannot attest to the restaurant). My boyfriend and I were visiting from Portland, and although I highly oppose chain establishments, we settled on this place because it wasn't too crazy and within walking distance of the hotel. Boy was I surprised! John, the bartender, is one of the most attentive and polished professionals out there! He kept us coming back every day during our trip just for his service. The drinks are amazing, food consistent, and service the best in town. Thanks, John!"}
{"text":"I have actually had very negative experiences at this Cheesecake Factory location in the past. I went back very hesitantly last night and I am happy to report I had a wonderful experience and good food. We sat outside by two warm heaters and had a very nice waitress who was very tolerant of my son. I wish I would have got her name because she deserves kudos on giving us excellent service. The dinner plate I got was very filling and now I have lunch for today, all for a reasonable price. I still hate their parking situation but it would not stop me from going back."}
{"text":"Let's just start off service is always great I've been coming to this cheesecake factory since it opened back in 2000's it's always friendly staff and hot food The only thing I'm a little disappointed some time bathroom is dirty and no soap I've let the staff know they been on top of it but  I think they should check their bathroom more often that's the only thing I would say bad about my local Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"OMG! So I have to say that one of my biggest weaknesses is cheesecake!!!! So of course I had to eat at the factory! 

I went to this place a lot when I was smaller, but I wasn't judging the food at that age. 

My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary while in Vegas. It was kind of a weird situation. We waiting a long time for a table since this place doesn't take reservations (bummer!) Then we sat next these 2 women who were arguing with each other at the table! I am not sure of they were friends or mother and daughter??? 

We ordered the Factory chopped salad that is tossed with a balsamic dressing. The salad has apples, bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, and a bunch of other yummy veggies that tie in with the dressing beautifully! As we were enjoying the salad, the two woman finished their argument and began a conversation with us! They started to recommend dishes that they like there and then were talking smack on other dishes, including the salad that we loved at this point! Anyways, they recommended the Chicken Piccatta and it was a hit with us! But watch out for the portion size! We were able to split the dish and still had a little left over. The chicken is cooked with a white sauce and capers...but we requested that the capers be left out ( I am not a fan). It comes with a size of pasta that compliments the chicken well. 

And for dessert, of course cheesecake! They have so many to choose from!!!! how can one make that decision??!! A few of my favs from there: The chocolate mousse cheesecake, the carrot cake cheesecake, the original flavor, and the tuxedo. You can also get the original flavor and there is a variety of fruit toppings that you can have added if you choose. 

All in all, this place rocks! They have a huge menu of entree items and the same size menu for the cheesecake! The service is really good but it is a very noisy restaurant, so if you are a looking for a quiet environment, this is not the place. The entrees are decently priced for the amount of food that you get. The cheesecake can be a little pricey ($6.95 a slice for most), but its soooooo worth it! 

If I could change one thing, I would have them start taking reservations! 

I will be back for many years to come! Enjoy all!"}
{"text":"I literally just created a Yelp account to share my thoughts about this restaurant and our waitress Julia. She was SUCH a sweetheart! We were able to sit outside in the \"patio\" part and the wait wasn't even long considering it is in the forum shops, and it was a busy Sunday afternoon. The service was great, Julia went above and beyond to make sure my friend and I had everything we needed. It's not often that you find servers who genuinely care about their customers so this really meant a lot to me and made my Vegas experience that much better. I will definitely return to this Cheesecake Factory during my next visit (Hopefully my new friend Julia will be here again)!"}
{"text":"We came in as a party of 9, 3 members of our party arrived 30 minutes prior to our arrival to reserve a table and make sure when the rest arrived we'd be close to being seated,  however that wasn't the case.  The full party had arrived and we informed the staff that we were all here and they kinda scoffed, but ok. We were waiting in the bar for someone to let us know the table was ready, 10 minutes and a party of 8 that came in after us was being seated, frustrated we went up to the hostess to ask what the hold up was and she looked really confused and said we'll get you seated shortly, 5 minutes later we're seated, waitress seemed irritated, and not very friendly, she was just ehhh. We're adults celebrating a sweet 16 birthday party the least you could do is pretend to enjoy your job. We ordered our food, it took about 25 minutes which if it wasn't for the good conversation we would have been more upset, but no biggie. My niece whose birthday it was had ordered sauce on the side, they couldn't even get that right, they did offer to remake it, but who knows how long that would've taken and she doesn't want to watch us all eat. I think they could've at least comped my niece's meal or maybe a free cheesecake, but nope. I think the service and food could have been a lot better, just be careful when choosing a spot with a big party."}
{"text":"Wow... My best experiences ever at a Cheesecake Factory... 

It was a wonderful night & a great experience, thanks to our server... I have to call the restaurant & get her name as that is something I many times fall short about... Names:( 

So I called her \"Blue Eyes\" during our dinner experience as she is a brown haired girl with brilliant blue eyes. She was very good natured... She smiled and laughed when I called her that and seemed to be ok with my nickname.  \"Blue Eyes\" arrived at our table immediately after we were seated & she took our beverage order... She was very welcoming & understanding as we explained that we were waiting for one more person who was joining us for dinner. So many times, servers can be put off by this... \"Blue Eyes\" was not having any issue with us having a late addition to our table.  

After we enjoyed our first adult beverage, which was delivered to us exactly as ordered... I decided that for my next beverage, I would prefer mine without ice.  \"Blue Eyes\" was so pleasant and non-resistant.  She brought my drink out exactly as I had requested it. She was helpful & conversational, while respecting our privacy.  She made great suggestions and was so encouraging about several fished which we asked about.  

The kale salad was scrumptious!!! We also ordered the Thai lettuce chicken platter. It is a Taste Blast and we actually ordered a second portion.  Bang Bang Shrimp/Chicken is always sensational here, but we were stuffed and did not have any room for more food! 

An ahi tuna carpaccio was another delightful, tasty treat.  Whatever sauce they used was lavished on top with some beautiful slices of avocado & cucumber thinly sliced on the side. 

Desert was of course cheesecake... I know the many flavors of cheesecake are supposed to delight me... This was chocolate & not my taste, although everyone else loved it.  Me... I Love their plain New York type cheesecake with some cherries or strawberries on top.  Yum classically delicious. 

We had a Lovely time and I will post this as soon as I find out the name of our server who we will ask for when we return to this great local restaurant. 

Ahhhhhh.... Her name is a Mystery... I called there & the hostess who answered the phone was zero help.  My bad for not getting her name:("}
{"text":"Excellent food, but have to wait a little wile.  Food come in big portion that I can only eat half of it."}
{"text":"First and foremost, Cheesecake Factory is not kid friendly. Yes they have a kids menu, but nothing to keep the little ones distracted. I took my daughter there for a lunch date and felt pressured to order as fast as possible. We ordered our drinks and went to use the restroom to wash up. By the time we came back, the table was cleared and setup for someone else. 

I asked our waitress why they cleared the table and she said that she thought we left, even though we ordered drinks and had bread on our plates.

It is not the worst place on the planet for food, but there are about 25 other restaurants in the area that I would choose before going back to The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"This has been a disappointing experience. The cheesecake seems to have changed a bit. The biggest issue was the sun blaring in our eyes. The staff was hesitant to put the screen down even though the sun was right in our eyes. It took 15 minutes for them to do it and they lifted the screens before we left....the sun was still in our eyes. It was very passive aggressive behavior from the staff. 

Our waitress was rude and kept reaching over to get things instead of Just asking.  Her tie ended up in my water.  I will not be visiting again anytime soon. Cheesecake Factory is just not worth it.


Note: it may be worth noting...my daughter had the mango key lime cheesecake. By the time we got home, she was feeling nauseous. She threw up multiple times throughout the night. I found her sleeping on the bathroom floor. The only thing she ate or drank differently than me....was that cheesecake."}
{"text":"Love this Cheesecake Factory !!!! The food was fresh, and the service is great. The waiter Jared was very friendly, attentive, and prompt with orders. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Service a a little slow. Mashed potatoes were cold when they came out. The cheesecake were good as always. Salted Carmel, lemon raspberry, white chocolate raspberry."}
{"text":"I had to give these guys a great review for their excellent service! I have celiac disease and these guys went above and beyond to make sure my food didn't get contaminated. They even served my food seperate from everyone else's and bagged my food seperately. I rarely eat out anymore and wasn't even planning to eat at Cheesecake Factory but our waitress insisted on checking with the chef and I was assured that they took allergies very seriously and had special procedures to follow. They did a great job - I didn't get sick!"}
{"text":"Waiting 10mins for water, 10mins for drink order, 10 mins for bread and main dish order, and 18 mins waiting for getting check after meal. Plz, hire more waiters or waitresses and training them professionally."}
{"text":"So it's our sons 16th birthday and he wanted to go to the Cheesecake Factory. Please keep in mind they don't take reservation and of course it's Friday night. So we arrived at 730ish and the wait was 35 plus minutes for 7 people. Our server Shawn M and he was no doubt one of the best server we've had in a long time. Shawn got us drinks and took our appetizer order which was very fast. After we ate our apps  we order dinner and waited waited waited waited for bread to come. Finally it arrived. Soon after our dinner came. It came in stages we got two entrees first and two minutes later got another two entrees and another two minutes later we got the other two. So six minutes total to get 6 out of 7 entrees. Well after 13 minutes later we finally got our last entrée and the manager brought it to our table and tried to make a joke about what happened verses apologizing. So bottom line 4 or more guest watch out.... Service AAAA+, Kitchen they no doubt have issues. Regardless how busy you are you have to be on point....We will not be back anytime soon. So if you have a special occasion and have 4 or more guest go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory has a lot of things going for it.  Great food, outstanding selection of dishes and appetizers, comfortable ambience, and pretty good service.  I am a fan for sure.  One thing I don't like is whenever they bring you something with a dipping sauce of any kind, they bring it in a tiny dish and you always have to ask for extra.  Okay, maybe I am just a pig and eating too much sauce.....but seriously, would be nice to at least ask \"is that going to be enough sauce or would you like an extra one.\"  Anyway, I am nit picking (otherwise I wouldn't be much of a critic), but the place is great on all other fronts!  Well done gang.

{"text":"Cheesecake Factory: I am officially closing the book on you. A few weeks ago my family and I visited you as I suspect was due solely on behalf of the Abilene paradox. Using Yelp check in as my time frame for reference, I started recording the times. 

Sat at 9:20
Ordered at approximately 9:30
Received first dinner at 9:50
Received second dinner at 9:58
Received third dinner at 10:06
Received fourth dinner at 10:12

As you can see from above, each of our dinners arrived with (by restaurant time standards) a huge gap in time in between them. If this was a business meeting or a date where one would have to wait to eat, each person's dinner would grow cold as it sat there. Since it was my family, I just watched everyone else eat while I waited for mine. A 22 minute time frame from when my sister got her dinner at 9:50! Either the server and/or kitchen has a very poor time management skills or food time management. Our server, who was very nice, seemed in over her head, disorganized, and very stressed. We were very patient and nice to her despite our frustrations. 

To make matters worse, I later left a complaint on Cheesecake Factory's Web page and heard nothing back from them. In all honesty, all I wanted was acknowledgment. 

Overall, the food is too expensive and mediocre. The service was not up to par. There are so many other \"elegant\" restaurants that I would rather enjoy visiting, so that is what I will do! Buh BYE, Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I love the food...love the cheesecake even more, but I hate the wait and the crowded seating.  I can't believe that they don't use No Wait.  The two hour wait and pagers that don't work outside of the doors make for an overly crowded lobby and miserable customers.  This trip I got the chicken tortillas.  My favorite part of this dish is the corn cakes.  They are so good.  The dish is a little bit spicy (but I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to heat).  I also had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake.  I am a huge salted caramel fan, but this cheesecake was so disappointing!  There's so much caramel it's overwhelming.  There are no other flavor dimensions.  It's probably the worst cheesecake I've had from there.  All the complaints aside, I love this place.  It's a special treat."}
{"text":"Had the Renee's special for lunch and was in the bathroom the next couple of hours. Came at about 11:30 and already packed."}
{"text":"The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory (besides all the Cheesecake) is that their menu is so expansive and there really is something for everyone to eat there. This was only my second time there but every time I have the hardest time picking out what to get because I want to pick more than one! 

We started with Buffalo Blasts as an appetizer and they come with 8 giant pieces! I was shocked when I saw the amount! They're basically fried Buffalo chicken dip and man were they good! With all the food that was yet to come, we probably didn't need to get them, but I'm still glad we did. 

My boyfriend and I each got a pasta dish which were very generous portions and both were very very good. My only complaint about the entire experience is that I could tell that my pasta was sitting out for a little while, so I guess we were waiting on my boyfriends meal before they could serve it to our table. It was still good and pasta is always a good leftover choice. 

Of course we ended the meal with Cheesecake. We decided to split one and got the cookie dough cheesecake. It was so so so good. In the words of my boyfriend \"I'm glad I've had plain cheesecake before this or I would expect all Cheesecake to taste just like this\". It tasted exactly like cookie dough. 

I would definitely come here again. It can definitely get pricy as their menu is so large and you just want everything, but maybe more frequent trips would make me feel like I can just pick one thing at a time!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this restaurant. Called to make a reservation for my daughters upcoming promotion dinner and they flat out refused since it would be after 5:30. It would be a large party with grandparents so to do a walk-in would be too risky. The lady who took the call was gracious and made me believe they could do it, but the manager Brad was rude. My daughter is very disappointed and I will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for a dessert date with some friends we have not seen in year or so. We talked so much . We finished desert and were going to order a appetizer but talked son much catching up we close the joint. The cheese cake was out of this world."}
{"text":"I've been to more than one Cheesecake Factory over the years.  I've always thought of this chain as being heavy on hype, but short on delivering the goods.

It has been a few years since my last encounter though, and naturally I was interested when they opened up at West Towne.  So I paid a visit today with the family, quietly hoping for a more memorable experience than I had in the past.

The restaurant presents itself well.  I like the curvy aisles and the booth-heavy seating.  Let's face it, everyone wants a booth, and nobody wants to feel like they are being placed on a grid.  The use of low light and warm color tones makes for a comfy environment.  Unfortunately the place is a madhouse right now, but I can see it rounding into form after the opening rush quiets down.

Once I started leafing through the menu, my memory of past visits started to return.  The thing is huge.  Pages of small plates, appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, every kind of specialty you can imagine.  Asian inspired dishes.  South Western inspired.  Italian inspired.  Just a flood of choices.  Where's the cheesecake?  Oh, it's there.  Lost somewhere among all the other stuff.

It's meant to be impressive, this overwhelming barrage of choices.  And, sure, it is.  But it's also hard to pick one thing from a list of...everything.  I felt like I might get lost and forget what looked good 3 pages back.

Now for the specifics.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich with a bowl of mushroom cream soup instead of fries.  Naturally it came with fries, but no big deal.  Our waitress quickly brought the soup and left the fries too.  The sandwich was long on bread and short on the rest.  Oh, it wasn't terrible.  Just average.  I would have preferred more \"Cuban\" and less \"sandwich\" though.  I didn't care for the soup, and found myself munching on the fries instead.

My wife ordered angel hair pasta with shrimp.  It was a little dry so she asked for more sauce.  Again, not bad but definitely not good, either.  Her martini didn't fill the glass, although she reported that it tasted fine.

We had crab dip as an appetizer and enjoyed it.  I'd say that was the highlight of our meal.

Even more impressive than the huge menu would be if they delivered it all with quality. But the reality is, they fall a little short.  They have 100 choices or more, but nothing really stands out. There's no focus, and that drags everything down.  Even worse, the restaurant is famous for its cheesecake. And it is probably the best thing you can get, but it's buried under the weight of all the other mediocre food.

To wrap this up, I'd like to recommend The Cheesecake Factory but I can't quite get there.  It's always looked fantastic from the outside, but once you get inside the reality doesn't match the aesthetic."}
{"text":"What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory?  It's just okay.  The food is good, but I have not craved the food there.  I have not received bad service, but I have not received exceptional service either.  The wait is usually very long and I can talk myself into going some place else rather easily.  

If you are in the mall and are hungry, check to see how long the wait is.  If the wait is short, give it a try.  If the wait is long, check Yelp for other options in the area."}
{"text":"I never thought there would be a day I would be writing a 3 star review on one of my favorite restaurants of all time. We came during the day at around 2:30 to 3 on a Monday. I was surprised that there was a wait time of about 15 minutes. We were seated with our party of 3 at that time. 

The bread was delicious and the waitress seemed nice. I got what I always got the chicken fettuccine Alfredo , my 5 year old got the corn dogs and my cousin has ordered the Philly cheesesteak. Everything was going good until waiting for the food. It was literally a good 36 minute wait time for the food and we didn't see the waitress at all during this time. The waiter at the table next to us told his frustrated customers that the kitchen was backed up. 

We eventually got our food. It was delicious but I never got my Parmesan cheese. This is one of my favorite parts, it had crossed my mind the maybe they did not do this anymore but the person at the table next to us had been asked and received some. We didn't see our waitress again for a very long time. It was very frustrating because of the time it had taken to receive our food my 5 year old was already restless and I was already ready to order dessert and get the check but took forever for her to arrive.  We had even asked eachother if it would even be worth it to order enough thing because of how much time it was taking for the simple things like asking for a refill or anything it was another 15 minutes 

The cheesecake I always receive... The original was drenched with sour cream topping ... It was gross. Normally they have just enough to taste with the whip cream but this thing was covered in it. We took a few bites and left it . 

I'm so disappointed because as I did this is my favorite place. One of the best things being the service and food and both things were a disappointment this time ."}
{"text":"Four stars only because the wait was soooo long lol. 

Service was great and the atmosphere was lively and what you'd expect. 

I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo. AMAZING. I highly recommend it. My friend ordered the Ahi tuna and said it was amazing as well. 

I had the Godiva cheesecake to take home and it was amazing. Don't order unless you're a true chocolate lover. Lol. It took me 3 days to finish it. I do agree that the cheesecake is expensive. But the slices are huge. It would be nice if they offered a smaller slice for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"The Skinny: solid food with varying consistency (3) the level of service is all over the place (3) value: okay - not that great, not that bad either.

I normally don't review a place that is a franchise. However, because my hubby and I frequent this one quite often, I felt like I had enough writing about this particular restaurant.

We've generally had pretty good consistency with regards to food here - barring one incident where we had raw corn fritters - twice. Service can be great depending on your server. Overall, not a bad place for a quick bite to eat but not my favourite either."}
{"text":"I do not like how they do not have a whole cheesecake ready for us to order. I don't think it should be necessary to order in advance just so they can defrost the cheesecake. You should be ashamed of yourself to be called The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people come here anymore. Oh sure, back in the day this place was amazing. Now, you can taste the prepackaged microwave-ness. I had the Kobe burger, 12.50 for a tasteless burger. My wife had the the pear and endive salad. There were no pears. The service was slow. The food was not at temperature. Soda machine was broken."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is an an amazing restaurant! There are so many choices with different types of food depending on what you are in the mood for! Try the s'mores cheesecake! It's delicious!!"}
{"text":"The ahi salad was the best I ever had. Sadly my husband's Cobb salad looked like they scraped other people's leftovers in the to go box. We did not dine in. If I realized what a mess that salad was before I got home I would not have took it. This was my husband's first time eating Cheesecake Factory food. I won't be able to get him to go back."}
{"text":"200 for dinner  asked for crushed red pepper fur my ok pasta.... still waiting for it after food is boxed and bagged"}
{"text":"Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do. 

We ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for. 

My husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had. 

Now for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Busy place
I like coming here...the service is always great
My wife will come back here after shopping at  Saks...I love unwinding in this place
My favorite meal -bistro shrimp ...followed by espresso and red velvet cheesecake..."}
{"text":"I pretty much come here with large parties (the tables allow for huge groups) or when I just can't make my mind up on what I feel like eating because this place has a little bit of everything. 

I've tried quite a few different things on the menu and it has all been pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but not disappointing either. The Chicken Madeira and the Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic (tell them to hold some of the garlic) are among my favorites.

And the cheesecake is always good. Lots of different varieties. Snickers, turtle, tuxedo, strawberry, etc. They are all good. But I've never met a piece of cheesecake I didn't devour."}
{"text":"Its Cheesecake Factory....been to one, you've been to them all."}
{"text":"As always, the Cheesecake Factory did not disappoint."}
{"text":"All is good at Cheesecake Factory. Had the fish and chips. Fish was good. The chips (fry's) may have been left over from lunch, they were cold and soggy.  Had low carb cheese cake to top it off, it was great."}
{"text":"This location is super busy because of the near by Casio.  The food is the usual American food options which is decent priced for the portions but they are really slow getting the food out. Its not a favorite of mine but it's not a bad place for dinner with an ambiance. The only reason I usually go is for the desert."}
{"text":"I mean, what can you say about The Cheesecake Factory?  The best part about going into a Cheesecake is that you know what you're going to get.  Everything's the same - the decor, the menu, etc.  Fortunately, there are so many things on the menu you would have to go there 50 times before you tried everything.  

This one is inside the Mall at Caesar's.  Great location.  Friendly staff.  I got the BBQ burger.  It was really good.  

Weirdest point of the evening though - I'm trying to remember if all the Cheesecakes are this way, but whatever I can't.  The floor was covered in grease.  Seriously - I was sliding around the joint.  I'm like - what is this Ice Capades?  Cheesecake Factory is the only place in Vegas where you can pirouette while deep throating a burger.  Nothing like a little entertainment with your meal, right?  

My advice is for the ladies to hold off on the heels while dining here, otherwise it's a solid meal."}
{"text":"Another visit to Cheesecake factory. The wait is definately downside to the experience - 1 hour. Service is always consistent, so kudos for that. We had their soup of the day (it was ok), Caesar salad (very good), Mac and cheese (horrible, Sent it back and it was promptly taken off the bill), kids grilled chicken and French fries - my son loved it and steak tacos (average to slightly above average). For dessert, my daughter had red velvet cheesecake (she like it, my wife and I were very disappointed in it, it's a regular cheesecake, with red velvet in between), Godiva Cheesecake GF (excellent, very dense) and fruit salad for my son (he loved it!). So overall, good experience again."}
{"text":"DOMINIC THE SERVER, BOY DO YOU SERVE! You're amazing. We miss you...

Happy hour is our favorite deal. Half-priced appetizers couldn't taste any better. We split three (3) of them for $20, and it sustains us until breakfast. 

We continuously go to this location to see Dominic. He is very delightful and is so kind! 

Get the fried macaroni and cheese bites!!"}
{"text":"On friday June 5th we had Sean A. as our server.  He was amazing. He was friendly and fast. We order chicken castalini and buffalo blast and it was so delicious. Serving sizes are huge. Great atmosphere and very welcoming. Always great customer service at this location."}
{"text":"First, I'll start by saying that I love Cheesecake Factory and come here regularly and will continue to do so, however this rating is based off my experience tonight. The waiter spoke to us three times throughout the night. Once to get drinks, next to take our order 20 minutes later, and once to tell us how she was shocked at how fast we ate our food and that we \"broke records\" which was mostly insulting.Then the manager came to bring our food and she, surprisingly had absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever. The only person doing an exceptional job tonight were the chefs and considering the restaurant was completely dead all night, I don't see any reason for that."}
{"text":"We've had dinner and lunch a number of times at The Cheesecake Factory and the food and service is always good.  It's a chain restaurant with an extensive menu so there is always something for everyone.  We went there for happy hour for the first time recently.  You have to sit in the bar area -- either at the bar or at high top tables -- and it seems to get very busy so get there early.  We were there on a Friday and the happy hours were 4 pm - 6 pm.  There are many drink and food options on the happy hour menu and we enjoyed everything we ordered.  The nachos were huge for just $5.95!  We also had a full-sized burger and some Southwestern egg rolls, also $5.95.  Plenty of food for the two of us!  We could have easily been satisfied with sharing just two items.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have visited the Henderson, NV location many times since 2007 and I have to say that tonight was the last straw. Our server, Deanna displayed unprofessional and inexcusable behavior towards my husband and I as well as our 4 guests. After we were seated we were greeted by our sever who unfortunately was about to leave for the day. She introduced Deanna as our new server while she made sure we had plenty to drink before she left. Deanna proceeded to take our food order and was very vocal when our friends ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with an extra order of fries. They told her that they were sharing the sandwich to which Deanna replied loudly \"that's it ? You're sharing a sandwich?\" She seemed irritated and it continued when my husband and I ordered the crusted chicken romano with a salad to share. She commented again \"you're sharing too?\" Then to cap it off when our friend's 5 year old told her father that she wasn't hungry she stated \"so she isn't eating anything!\" 

Honestly, I found her behavior apalling and I have no problem taking my business to Lucille's and/or Claim Jumpers which are both just across the street. The food here is good but I don't need to be shamed for sharing a dinner that is actually large enough for 3 people. We will not be back anytime soon!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday evening. I always opt for the chopped salad. It always come to me the same way...delicious! I had a glass of Reisling and end the evening with the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. You are doing your body an injustice if you have not had this cheesecake. OMG! One slice is too big, but you better believe I will finish it on day two! 

I sit at the bar and the staff is always talkative and friendly; offering area tips and must-sees."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory! I generally visit the Factory to get the chocolate dream extreme cheesecake! It's delicious after any course! This particular location is always pleasant to visit. Conveniently located. Nice to visit after a long day of shopping too! The bar staff is on point. I cannot speak for the other staff, as I haven't sat in the dining area. Pleasant ambience. The drinks are stiff and the cheesecake always arrives timely. Love this location."}
{"text":"WOW I called today on Dec 21st at to ask the hostess if this was the Scottsdale fashion square location. She responded \"NO.\" I said ok do you have that locations number. She responded \"No I don't sorry.\" I'm thinking how does a hostess not have a list of their neighborhood locations?! So I look again online and accidentally called the same chipper hostess back. I asked the same question. She replied \"NO! You just called!\" I've been in the restaurant industry for a long time and in a hostess position your most important part of your job is to be nice over the phone and personable. I really cannot believe how rude she was for no reason. Shouldn't be in the customer service industry."}
{"text":"My brother referred to The Cheesecake Factory as an upscaled Denny's/

You know, he is right.  Lots of booths, big menu, predictable outcome.

1 star for large (or is too large) portions
1 star for wide variety of cheese cake options.

A bit too busy, noisy and too large for our tastes."}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki, the chicken came out raw in the middle. After the waiter had it reheated the underside was completely burnt. I paid $76 for us to eat lunch and I had to stop at Wendy's to eat. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Welcome to The North Outlets! Love this place like any other of their locations. Amazing restaurant and kitchen management tonight that did everything and more to help with our experience.
Thank you for accommodating my family when our food wasn't up to par. Lovely servers! Shoutout to John and Lucas from Boca!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I found ourselves drunk and starving at the Forum Shops one Saturday afternoon. Too tired to find a cheap place to eat (which was hard in the Forum Shops) but not wanting to spend a crazy amount of money for lunch, we found the Cheesecake Factory! I know... we can find this restaurant back at home... but we were really hungry and the Factory never really had failed us in the past.

We were seated right away, and we sobered up quickly with their complimentary bread, lol. We decided to eat light (as we planned to eat greasy pizza later that night) so we ordered calamari and the luau salad, which were both very good and served in big portions. We ended the lunch with a macadamia nut cheesecake, in celebration for my late birthday with my girlfriends!

Overall, it was a good experience with good food and good friends. We're glad to have found this restaurant while super drunk. Thanks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. PROS- no wait, friendly waiter, large menu. CONS- atmosphere was very warehouse/industrial, food was overpriced. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ok, so me and my friend went there on the weekend and we had to wait in line for 2 hours!
Well, if the food was great it may be ok to a certain extent but we were terribly disappointed. 
I have been to cheesecake factories in the States and have had a good experience but this place wasn't good at all. 

The calamari tasted like it came out of a frozen package from Cosco and that for some $17. 
Everything seemed overpriced considering the low quality. 

Not great."}
{"text":"On 6/1/14 me and my family came to your restaurant. We were seated quickly.our waiter was the best.and the food was  great.our experience was a 10 plus . and this restaurant gets five stars from us.we all left full and happy.thank you for a wonderful evening. And our compliments to Dan our waiter and your cook."}
{"text":"I tried the pork belly sliders  They were delicious and shareable. I also tried the original strawberry cheesecake and it was pretty good. The portion is pretty big.

Service was friendly but I had to ask for a lot of things that should have been done automatically. (Clean the table before sitting customers, put cutlery on the table before food arrives instead of after, fill up water regularly, etc.) I was sitting at the bar and my server was the guy at the bar at nighttime, very late. I would try to get a table next time and see if the service is better.

I would probably go back and try other food items + other types of cheesecake."}
{"text":"We opted to sit at the bar since there were a couple of parties waiting to be seated. It was a busy Saturday night and loud in the cavernous room. We ordered a hamburger and two slices of cheesecake. It took a long time to get our cheesecakes. The bartender said the bakery was behind on orders. In the end, we got the cheesecakes to-go but were a treat to eat at home. Service at the bar was good and attentive.There's outdoor seating, in front of the mall, or in the mall across from Sephora."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants because of the consistency of the food and service. This time I was very disappointed in the kitchen and the food runners. I ordered chopped salad which came out 10 minutes before the dressing. My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich which came out 20 minutes before the French fries. Seemed like the kitchen couldn't synchronize the food to come out together. With that said the chopped salad wasn't chopped the chicken was served in big pieces that looked like they were pulled apart by hand. Dry and tough. The lettuce was basically shredded not chopped but everything else was chopped so once again inconsistent.  I am hoping it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"Very nice! Excellent food and service. Megan was a great server and very personable. We like this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a late dinner. We ordered the Chicken Bellagio and Chopped salad. The Chicken Bellagio was delicious! The chicken was tender and crispy at the same time and the pesto pasta was perfect! The bread arrived warm and soft with a crispy crust. The service was great and our drinks were topped without any prompting. The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the chopped salad was a tad over dressed. Also, we've been to the Cheesecake factory several times and it's not consistently 5 stars."}
{"text":"I kind of have mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory. On one hand, I love the ambience of the restaurant and the waiters are always nice and friendly, it's also my favorite place to get cheese pizza. On the other hand, the portion sizes and the caloric values of their food is kind of ridiculous. I mean, 1500+ calories for a piece of carrot cake? Is it really necessary to make it that fattening? I now try to avoid eating here since their meals are too high in calories and too addictive, like the majority of restaurants are nowadays."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that it's a chain, I loved this place! I sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon and ordered a \"lunch\" salmon at 4pm for $14.95. It came with large asparagus, a heap of mashed potatoes, and a huge filet of salmon. Definitely a $25 meal anywhere else.

I'll definitely be back for lunch again here soon. The portions are gigantic and enabled me to have enough leftovers for a second meal. They also have a skinny cocktail list that is a nice touch. 

The menu is very conscious of vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free eaters. They have many suggestions for substitutions already printed on the menu."}
{"text":"See update at end.

This is a BAD review.  I don't like doing this but the customer service we just received (or lack thereof) from the Manager, Steve Shirvinski, was abysmal.

We just came back from dining at The Cheesecake Factory.  This was only the second time I've eaten there.  The first time we were there was when they first opened.  The food and service were spectacular.  We were so impressed, I ended up buying over $200 in gift cards as Christmas gifts.

One of the deals with the gift cards was that they came with a card that was good for a free piece of cheesecake.  I had really been looking forward to that slice and was saving it for a special occasion.  Tonight we were celebrating a big event, so it was finally the right time to use the card.  Unfortunately, I hadn't noticed the card expired 3/31.

I knew there probably wasn't much chance that I'd be able to talk them into honoring the card at this late date but I wanted to give it a try.  I asked to speak to the manager so I could plead my case.  I was shocked when the waitress came back to the table to tell me THE MANAGER REFUSED TO EVEN SPEAK TO ME.  I pointed out to the waitress that this was really poor customer service on his part but all she could do was shrug her shoulders and apologize.  The manager shouldn't have put her in that position.  I felt sorry for her.  It  could have affected her tip (it didn't.)

I don't know why the manager couldn't be bothered to talk to me.  I wouldn't have been mad if he'd still said the card had been expired too long if he'd at least heard me out.  His refusal to even talk to me is what has enraged me.

So, guess what Steve Shirvinski, next Christmas there will be NO gift cards purchased from The Cheesecake Factory.  They will be purchased from your competitors.  Oh, and the next time I have something special to celebrate?  I'll be doing it some place else.  When people ask me for recommendations, I'll make a point of telling them NOT to go to your establishment. You've permanently lost a customer, just because you couldn't be bothered to give that little bit of customer service and hear me out.

Update:

I got a call at 9:30 this morning (the day after our dinner and my post) from Steve Shirvinski.  He apologized for our experience and said he was never made aware that I asked to speak to him.  He said he had recently honored some free slice coupons for another customer and that he wouldn't have refused to speak to me about the issue.  He plans to send me a written apology and a $25 gift certificate.  I've changed my review from 1 star to 3.  I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"It was my family's first visit to the Cheesecake Factory about a week ago. It was a Friday night and we were obviously expecting a longer wait because we didn't make reservations. There were probably fifty people outside waiting, so we just decided to stick it out. 

Five minutes later, we get buzzed in. The host who had been very rude and bitchy for lack of a better word, hadn't bothered to ask how many people were in our party, and assumed two. Um, no, it was four. They dealt with their mistake by bumping us right into a table, past all those who had been waiting much longer. Of course, everyone was upset. 

The service isn't memorable, even a week later. We were seated on the outside patio, which was warm in the 50 degree weather and rain outside. The food didn't live up to any hype most people give it. The other people in my family liked theirs, but it just wasn't special. Also, the people next to us ordered a lot of seafood, so I was forced to smell that awful aroma the whole night. It felt like there was just no space! It was chaos. Not impressed, but I'll probably give it another try eventually."}
{"text":"It's a cold night, walking in didn't feel warm enough.  We got sat right away at the booth closest to the door.  I mentioned it was cold here but we were not relocated.  Two of our menus at the table were greasy. There were some crumbs on the table.  The server Chris greeted us and listed the specials.  He brought our drink orders right away.  I always get strawberry lemonade $3.95.  It very sour and sweet!  He said he was going to come right back with bread.  He came back to take our order, no bread.  After a while he brought us water along with our bread. The Thai wraps $13.50 were nicely plated and arrived just as I finished my first piece of bread.  I didn't have any, but the boys finished it all and liked it. We were given hot towels after the finger food appetizers!   +!  My pasta da Vinci $16.95 tastes good as always.  Slightly creamy, chicken, mushrooms, fresh Parmesan.  I prefer to come in during lunch to order the smaller portion.  Cheesecake Factory servings are generous. The food here is always consistent, location to location.  The service was timely. Total for 3 of us with alcohol, appetizer, and a dessert was $146.75."}
{"text":"Their Factory nachos may be the best nachos on the planet.  They are FANTASTIC!  I recommend getting extra of the delicious pico."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has good American food and is more upscale than your usual Applebee's or TGI Friday's. They have extensive food as well as drink menu - some of which are good and others not so much. The sandwiches and salads are tasty but I would stay away from their \"chinese\" food. My personal top orders are the Grande Burrito and Luau Salad. For appetizer, the Factory Nachos are the way to go. Warm, crunchy nachos with pulled chicken, salsa, sour cream, cheese, jalapenos, beans, guac and probably more. And of course their cheesecakes are very good - never had a bad one.

Getting a table there can be a long affair if you go during peak times so go during off hours if you can. The level of service is also directly correlated to how busy they are in my experience. 

All in all, not a bad place if you're looking for a casual dining experience and some great cheesecake."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch and was craving for some healthy salad. There are a few salad dishes in their small bites or skinny menu that I have been wanting to try, so I ordered the fresh vegetables salad. When I received the order I was disappointed. There were no beets to be found. At first I doubted myself... thinking maybe I ordered something that doesn't have beets. So I didn't tell my server. I should ask a question but I didn't want to be a pain. The salad honestly was very plain. A lot of lettuce that I don't care for... I should have ordered the beets with Arugula. Oh well maybe the skinny menu is to blame. Hubby ordered the blackened shrimp on the other hand it was fantastic dish.

I do enjoyed my iced tea. Who should have thought mint leaves can turn an ordinary ice tea into refreshing and magical!?"}
{"text":"I always love Cheesecake Factory! :) their happy hour is amazing. My bf loves their macaroni balls. I love their viet spring rolls. We always order the wheat bread also: soft and yummy! :) the servers here are really nice too."}
{"text":"I haven't ate at a cheesecake in a very long time. 

It was a little confusing because the entrance that's located in the shopping area of the outlets mall is at the back of the restaurant so you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the hostess stand. Honestly I never liked that because its weird. Anyways, just an opinion..so as we got to the hostess only for us to tell us its going to be 15-20 min. Odd to us because since we walked through the restaurant we saw it was completely empty so 15-20 min? Ok...

We were sat after about 10 min and we were greeted by one server who said she would give us a few minutes after taking out drink order.  A couple minutes later another server comes up and greets us and asks if we would like some bread, we say sure. The first server comes back with our drinks and starts to take our order. The second server comes back with our bread, sees the server taking our order, says to her she can do it and then......they proceed to argue about who's table it is. Uhhhh??? So needless to say that was interesting. 

So moving on we place our oder, get our food and the food was pretty good. I had the ahi tuna salad which was extremely tasty and very fresh. We also ordered a burger which was huge! The food saved this experience for us."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years (25+) and it never disappoints.  Ever.  I have found my favorites and typically stick to those: Cajun Chicken Littles, Herb Crusted Salmon, Chicken Costoletta, Avocado Eggrolls. The menu is massive and has just about everything.  I also want to mention the sauces and sides are amazing.   The corn succotash, creamy lemon sauce and that Tamarind cashew dipping sauce for the eggrolls are perfection.  The redskin mashed potatoes are so delicious as well.  I want to try everything on the menu but always seem to stick to what I crave.  And let's not forget their cheesecake.  The best.  One of my favorite restaurants for sure!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened to CF?!!!

My wife and I were very excited to take our kid to experience what used to be a \"sure thing\" for us back in high school. It used to be that service and quality was above par here each visit. 

While on vacation we visited this location. 

Where do I start?

First, our server Erin was AMAZING! She knew the extensive menu cover to cover. Not just the popular items, she new each ingredient, sauce, protein and made recommendations based on our preferences. 

At the end of this experience, the manager Adam was very nice too.

That's all the good I have to say.

The table we were sat at had a 2 inch by 3 inch chunk of the granite or what ever stone material the table was made of missing! The entire corner of the table. Luckily I noticed and told my 6 year old not to touch it. We didn't want to be moved because by the time I noticed it we had bread and drinks wanted to get on with our meal.

It took over 30 minutes to get our food after ordering. A party of 12 was sat next to us well after we ordered and they all had their food about 3 minutes after we got ours. It took so long that our kids were bored and ready to go. So we asked for boxes and took it to go. 

Before we left I noticed that my Farfalle chicken was missing the chicken!!!! They took it back and added chicken to the dish. Also, my dish, essentially a bowtie pasta, was the same portion. Size as my two daughters pasta dishes from the kids menu. I paid $20 for a kids size dish!

We ordered cheese cake to go. Red velvet, Celebration, and Tiramisu. They were all just okay. I remember when CF cheesecake was to die for. 

My wife's hibachi steak was okay. Not bad but not really good. It came with wasabi mashed potatoes. There was no wasabi flavor and they were incredibly dry and grainy.

In the end, the manager Adam comp'd one of the cheesecakes, whoopty do.

We spent just shy of 2 hours and $120 on that experience. My server was so awesome that we still tipped %20. Everything else was lame."}
{"text":"We had lunch with our family here today and good thing we arrived early to get a number before opening time as it ensured we would be seated shortly at opening.  Service was prompt and friendly with frequent check-ins and good pacing of appetizers, entrees and dessert.  We were overwhelmed with the menu offerings - a double digit menu, wow!  You can definitely come back until you're bored and always find something new and enticing to sample.  We ordered a mix of entrees of pasta, fish 'n chips, salad, steak tacos and steak, no complaints!  Dessert was definitely a stretch but we didn't want to miss out on the full experience.  Again, manh cheesecake options for every taste.  Overall, an enjoyable dining experience; price point a bit high compared to competitors but given it's an American adaptation, not too surprised."}
{"text":"Busy night but still got sat within ten minutes at a nice booth for five. Server was friendly and attentive. All of us ladies enjoyed our food greatly and not one complaint was spoke, that's pretty good with five chics at a table. My chicken was tender and the cheesecake  was amazing. Definitely will be back! Best wings with blue cheese I've ever had as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Fine food for the right price, good portion. Wait time is a little rough but if you have the time, it's all good! Oreo cheese cake is a plus! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 last Saturday and got sat quickly  at a large table with food on the floor and on one of the chairs   I brought this to the attention of a waiter nearby but rather then have someone come by with a broom he grabbed a napkin off the table and scooped the food up off the floor then used the other end of the napkin to wipe off the chair   The food we ordered was good but just lukewarm. Drink refills were very slow in coming.  Was not the great experience we hoped for but the cheesecake is still the best"}
{"text":"We met some friends there, there were 4 of us all together.  I ordered a Navajo chicken sandwich.  My daughter ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and my friends ordered an Asian chicken salad and a chicken salad sandwich.  20 minutes later, my friends got their food.  And I wait and i wait, and finally 5 minutes later Megan and I got ours.  So we finally begin to eat.  The food was just okay, didn't really taste like much of anything.  Megan said her cheeseburger was ok.  Megan and I also both got a margarita, and for  $8.00 you get about 6 ounces of drink, and that's frozen margaritas, not on the rocks.  Glasses are TINY and the drink was not anywhere near good.   Certainly not worth $8.00.  Restaurant is so noisy you have to  yell across the table to hear anyone, and at night they dim the lights so low you have to really focus on the menu or you can't read it.    All in all a pretty bad experience.   The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the cheesecake is pretty good.  $8 for a slice, definitely not worth that, but it tastes good.  I won't be going back and if you don't go either, there's no doubt you have made the right choice."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly even with a long wait at lunch time. Our sever was patient even though we took turns ordering beers every time she came by  . We had the meatloaf and the veggie burger... Both perfect.  
My only complaint when I come here is just they the tap water is disgusting! (Worse than any other Vegas restaurant.) no problem, it's my fault for ordering tap water . Lesson learned. 
On the way out we ordered a cheese cake slice to go.  I've never tasted a fresh Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. IT WAS DELISH!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible. My friend who's birthday it was arrived @ 7pm knowing that there are no reservations accepted, we weren't seated until 8:50. No one came and updated us about the wait or anything we just sat there and say there while other guest who arrived after us were seated . When we were finally seated the waitress (Katrina) promptly brought drinks and took our order. The food came about 30 minutes later and there was a mistake on every order . EVERY ORDER. We didn't complain because we'd already waited so long and were starving . So now it's time to pay.............. Katrina gives me my check and I place my card with the receipt and put it in her hand . She returns with everyone's card and MY CARD WAS MISSING. I bring it to her attention and she says she's going to retrace her steps and see if she can find it . She returns not even a full 2 minutes later saying she lost it . LOST MY CARD ! she then says \"I'll pay for your food girl, I got you\" What about my missing card ?! wth are you going to do about that?! Needless to say , nothing was resolved and I now have to wait 5-7 business days for a new one and I have no time to go to the bank because I work 8 am - 9pm . 

Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I do love cheesecake!  Those two words should not be combined to create a word to describe such deliciousness...but I will not allow such transgressions to distract from my indulgences!  The CF does such an excellent job...I should have ordered two to go.  The red velvet is superb...I'm now wearing it permanently on bum.  Yes...once on my lips and bam...there it is!!"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Why?  When Madison is full of so many great restaurants, why are you here to lure and disappoint, Cheesecake Factory?"}
{"text":"The food is always good but the service sucks. The first time I came here, my family and I waited for a good 20 minutes before a server even got to our table. Someone finally noticed but we just decided to leave. Unacceptable!

On another occasion, our waiter rarely checked up on me and my friend. We had to ask for a basket of bread instead of him giving it to us in the first place. He was tending to everyone else except for us and I didn't really understand why. No tip for him!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take a second to say thank you to the manager working right now. I come here relatively often and even though I didn't have a great experience this time I would still come back. I order the herb lemon chicken and when it arrived the potatoes were cold and the sauce was very clearly not right. I've had this before and it's usually so good. This time it was very sour and weird. The manager not only took off the item from our bill but gave us a gift card to come back next time as an apology. That is so amazing and he knows how to take care of customers. Mistakes always happen at restaurants but it's how you treat your customers that make the experience. Thank you!! Not necessary but very much appreciated."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and parents on Sunday of the Black Friday weekend. Got in front of the restaurant at 2pm, and was seated at 530pm. The most annoying part of the wait is that you have to physically line up just to get to the podium and get a buzzer. I waited in line for around 45 minutes before getting my buzzer. Once you get the buzzer, you are free to go walk around the mall and do whatever you want. The buzzer only works in the vicinity of the restaurant, so they'll give you an approximate time of when you should come back to the restaurant.

Once you are seated, the service is very good and quick. Our waiter was very friendly, took our orders and checked in on us a few times. He also gave us the heads up that the cheesecakes were taking a bit longer, so had us order the cheesecakes right before we got our main, so that we didn't have to wait too long for the dessert after. 

The food was on par with the US. My go to appetizer is the avocado spring rolls. I highly recommend these. It comes with 6 pieces, which I think might be a smaller portion than the US (but I might also be remembering wrong). The appetizer came really quickly, and once we finished that, didn't have to wait very long for the mains. We got two cheesecakes. The banana creme is amazing and very nice and light. The white chocolate macadamia was a bit too heavy for us, the first two bites were yummy, and then it was just too creamy and sweet."}
{"text":"I waited for three long hours to get in. I got the calamari for app and two pastas and two cheesecakes to go. 

Portions as one can imagine mirror the ones in the states. BIG! The service was excellent people were nice and restaurant did not change from its counterparts in the states. 

The cheesecakes were great I got the coffee chocolate one and a strawberry one to go. 
I personally do no think it's worth the hype after going. It's well done food but not amazing. If you have patience just go after the hype whenever that maybe."}
{"text":"In general I stay away from chains. But a few days ago i had a good meal at cheesecake. It was no French Laundry but that is not what you expect going in.  All our food was correct (the table had many modifications) and everyone enjoyed the food.

Everyone knows the menu can be very overwhelming.  I have read books small then it.  But was a group is gives variety .     

The following was ordered:
Beets with Goat Cheese (Small Plates and Snacks) = the greens where bright and fresh.
Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad (Salads) = over-sized, a good mix of chicken, greens, and crunch. 
 Carne Asada Skirt Steak (Steaks & Chops) = build your own tacos anyone? that is what you get here.  
 
The service on a busy weeknight was very good also."}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep returning, and why the place is always packed. I will say that my fish and chips were horrible. The fries tasted just like the ones at station casinos, over processed and nasty. The fish had no flavor as did the tartar sauce. The lettuce wraps were good, and we ordered a piece of original cheesecake to take home.

 The worst part about cheesecake factory at Summerlin, is that the service is very hit or miss. These servers know that the they will always be busy, so they really don't try  hard to provide good service. I'm not asking for much. It took 15 minutes to get our bread basket and butter, but they didn't remember to give us silverware. A few minutes later, the waiter brings out silverware, after I already took it from an empty adjoining table. The waiter had the nerve to give me a long, dirty stare. You just don't do that as a server, you apologize, and move on. You never stare at your customer when they are hungry and have waited so long for bread, butter, and utensils. If we ever go back, it is just to order a piece of cheesecake from the to-go bakery."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! My family of 4 waited over an hour for our food and the server NEVER came to let us know why it was taking so long, refill drinks or check on us for anything! My husband finally had to track down a manager and she told us the computer system crashed, still no communication between management and the patrons, staff or anyone, when the food came it was horrible and cold, we were beyond unhappy. Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Well everyone knows the Cheesecake Factory the food is rich and makes you smile very wide! This location especially always has a wonderful wait staff that are very quick clean and courteous! Today we had Connor the extremely handsome waiter that really understood our bread needs he had a great smile and was really quick to help us out! Oh and the cheesecake was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"If you go on a weekend expect a very long 1and a half to a 2 hour wait.  Friend wanted to go here so just drank couple drinks at bar while waited. Food very good, I had chicken Romano which was good. Buddy had salmon dish that she loved. Wifey had a Hawaiian salad which she said was very good .  Of course deserts"}
{"text":"Food excellent.  Glass of cheap wine $9 and a mixed water down drink $8.50 ridiculous."}
{"text":"We waited 4 hours for our table!   Got there at 6:30pm and didn't eat until almost 11:00pm.   Is It worth the wait?   If you are patient enough and hungry enough I think so!   We had the egg roll sampler as an appetizer and I ordered the honey truffle fried chicken with mashed potatoes.   I also got 3 cheesecakes for the road.   The ambience is nice,  the decor is very new and the staff are very friendly.  My egg roll sample was great.  My favorite is the cheeseburger egg rolls and the avocado egg rolls.   I did not really like the Salmon or Mexican chicken rolls.   I wouldn't order them again.   I think I would just order the cheeseburger egg rolls.   My main, the honey truffle friend chicken was soooo good!   I really liked how you could taste the hints of honey with every bite of chicken.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus that accompanied my meal was petty delicious too.  You could taste the butter.    I ordered 3 cheesecakes to go.   The hazelnut chocolate,  white chocolate raspberries and the caramel white chocolate macadamia.  I really like the white chocolatier raspberry one!  It is sooooo good!  I would order just the cheesecakes next time.  I do not think I would wait 4 hours for a meal.  I was so hungry that I almost filled up on my bread.   
Speaking of bread, because we were there until closing, the waitress gave us a free loaf of bread.   All 6 of us got 6 large loaves of bread!   Can you believe It!    Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in my trip here tonight. We went for my friend's birthday. The place was completely empty when we got there around 9pm, yet we still had to wait for a table which was strange. Our server was cute and friendly but he failed me in a couple other ways. First, I started off with an iced tea and then decided later on in the meal that I wanted to try the strawberry lemonade like my friend did and he charged me for both drinks. I work at a restaurant and I would NEVER do that to a customer, unless it was an alcoholic beverage of course. Second, I ordered the fish tacos (big surprise I know) and was disappointed. He didn't ask me if I wanted the fish grilled or fried (I wanted fried) so when I got them and they had grilled fish i wasn't happy. Plus the cheese in the tacos was so overpowering that I couldn't even taste the fish. I wish I could give this place a better review but those two things kind of ruined the experience for me."}
{"text":"I love cheesecake factory and grand lux cafes, so I knew coming in that this was a good choice... we did have a minor hickup with table seating... we were sat next to the POS machine and for the first 1/3 of our meal we got to hear all the personal conversations and happenings of the servers.....    i politely requested to be moved and the manager(didnt get his name) was so fast and efficient in moving us....   his efforts were appreciated...  our server was wonderful!   I would definitely return and feel safe recommending to other yelpers  :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service at check in. We were told to wait 45mins and as of writing of this review it is 70 minutes and we just got seated."}
{"text":"The factory remains the same since my last visit.....long wait times, and average food.  We had a hungry group of 4 looking for a variety of items to choose from and this place definitely has a huge menu....which may be why most of the food is just average.  I usually go with the burrito here as a safe bet but I decided to try the fish tacos with rice and beans and it was just....meh.  I really think the only thing worthy in this place is the cheesecake even though it is overpriced......"}
{"text":"Cheesecake had been the talk of the day so it wasn't a surprise we opted to eat dinner here. 

Service was fine overall, there were a few mistakes with our order.  My sister ordered extra noodles with her meal and when it came out we had to ask if it has extra noodles. All i gotta say is I wonder how much noodles comes when you dont order extra noodles..hmm!??

Ok moving on..the food itself was pretty good. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, it was huge so on the flip side i can't say they were skimpy with the lettuce.  we also had the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls. Pretty much like a spring roll but with more vegetables in it. Favorite part was the Rye bread, yum!! Soft, warm and delicious. Is that sad that my favorite part of the meal was the bread? Oh wells!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is just phenomenal. Expensive, yes, but eating a slice of cheesecake is a meal in itself: so rich and wonderful.
The food is average. It's good, but nothing fantastic for the price. Lunch portions are a better deal, but again, the food is nothing phenomenal compared to other restaurants in the surrounding area.
I'll regularly stop in to just get a piece of cheesecake to go, which they'll happily box up for you with a cute side of whipped cream in the container."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is hands down the best Happy Hour during the week!!! My top three appetizers are the Buffalo Blasts which is a best kept secret at this restaurant! Avocado egg rolls are great to share but I've been known to keep these all to myself and last but not least the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes!"}
{"text":"So many choices these days and I feel disappointed for having picked Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner on a Sunday evening! What a mistake :(

Requested to be seated in the patio outside since it was a beautiful day so we were taken all the way to the back right by the garbage and take out door! 

Waitress gave us a very disappointing/poor service and the only reason I could think of would be that I didn't order a drink. I've noticed waiters attitude changes when you don't order something other than water! 

The experience was very disappointing as I didn't feel like I could ask our waitress for anything without getting this spurious smile as if I'm an annoyance! This confuses me as I'm under the impression they work on TIPS! 

They had the take out delivery guy pulling up right behind us every 10 minutes and the door opening and closing the entire experience, very annoying.

If I ever decide to torture myself again and return to this place, I will be sure to ask for someone who enjoys their time at work and makes it a great experience for guests! I suggest customer service training for The waitress whose name rhymes with Bora"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that they have the best peach Bellini EVER!!

A small group of us came here and ordered the following...
Peach Bellini
Roasted beets with goat cheese salad
Kale and Quinoa salad
Crispy crab bites
Ahi tartare
Basil tomato flatbread

Everything was delicious!  The service was great.  Our server, David F. was super nice and welcoming.

I love this location."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! Even thought they were busy we only  waited about 2 mins for a table!! Our server I believe was Brittany, she gave us  amazing service!! She was attentive, and made us feel welcome, she makes you feel like if your her only customer, and to my fiancé that's a important quality on a server, definitely coming back to this location even if is a hour drive from home!!! Keep up the amazing service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the quick seating tonight, usually a 45 minuets! Good food and service 
Cheesecake definitely the best"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory's mediocre food is absolutely not worth the wait. It's new and the excitement still hasn't worn off and the wait time even on a weeknight exceeds two hours - they don't even take reservations so what is the point?? The staff do not manage the crowds and wait times effectively. It's always a zoo. Don't bother coming here until the excitement has worn off - and maybe not even then considering how overpriced it is."}
{"text":"A menu that is a mile long and a wait time going to an hour and a half with no ability to make a reservation is asinine. When we finally did get to the table to sit, we weren't greeted for about 15 minutes and that was the best part of the evening. After taking our orders, our waitress didn't check on us again until the food was served but but by that time my wife and I had no water just ice cubes sitting lonely in the bottom of our glass. I ordered the Miso Salmon and my wife ordered the Petite Filet. I wasn't pleased at all with the Salmon because it was pink in the middle and my wife didn't really care for the Filet because it wasn't cooked to order. We decided not to have the food sent back because it would've taken forever and two days to get the food back. 

The wait staff seemed like they could care less and on many occasions they were simply MIA. They tried to push desert on us but we were ready to go and get desert someplace else. This is not the type of service I expected because I've been to other Cheesecake locations across the states and this was the worst experience. The staff needs more customer focused training and being attentive not blind to the needs of your clients. I based on this experience couldn't recommend you to spend your money here unless you enjoy mediocre service. I don't write my review lightly because I understand that business can get packed and scheduling issues can affect service but if you're in SouthPark, fix that if you expect to stay relevant!"}
{"text":"Always good food.
Always just right feels like something is happening but not too loud.
Giving our server Ana C a shout out.
She was wonderful - friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The food here is good most of the time. Have had to send a few things back because they didn't measure up to what the Cheesecake Factory should be. My reason for the 3 star rating is that the last 3 times I have been there (2 month time frame) I have had to ask for clean silverware and or dishes. Seems like they have dried food particles on them and very bad water spots. They are down to one sink in Women's restroom and have been for a few weeks now. Also the floors in dining area are always greasy looking and have been slippery like they were mopped with grease water. Had very bad sewer smell outside of this place on Sunday 8/2/2015. Maybe they need their grease traps cleaned??? This place used to be better.  I thought they had better standards but they are slipping and I will go elsewhere until they clean up their act."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last weekend, here's a summary of my visit:

Pros: 
- A wide variety of choice of food. 
- Food and cocktails were very well made and very tasty. 
- The building and decor is lovely, very spacious, high ceilings and cool which is great on a hot day. 
- Service was excellent and food was out in great time. 
- Nice bar area for when you're waiting. 

Cons: 
- Cheesecake was pretty underwhelming for a \"Cheesecake Factory\". I have had better from Acme. 
- Menu is overwhelmingly big.
- Drinks are very overpriced. 
- Food is pretty expensive too. 
- Had to fight through a hoard of teenagers to get inside
- Busy, chaotic and crowded in the foyer, not a welcoming feeling at all. 

Summary: A nice place to eat, I will return. They need to cut down the menu and the pricing too. If you're going to charge that much for food and drink, improve the quality of your cheesecakes, quantity of the cocktails and do a bit of crowd control!"}
{"text":"Ahhh(: yummy. Thai chicken wraps are so good!!

Our service every time is great, Chris our server was attentive and on top of our drinks while we sat outside in the heat. That's key!!

Cute food runner girl to stephine was so sweet made us feel at home(: 

Good ol cheese cake factory has yet to let me down."}
{"text":"5 star service tonight! Thank you Isaiah! What a crazy Christmas Eve night. Tired from shopping, wrapping (thinking about all the wrapping to go), and hangry. After waiting for 30 min on this crazy busy night at CF, Isaiah was there to impress. Table touched endlessly. Drinks always full. Bread and butter never without. Kids needs of napkins and extras met. Thank you kind sir, especially on Christmas Eve when you could be home serving your family, your serving hours like Momma would. Thank you, thank you. Made a new fan for life. Food was fresh, all that. But great service makes all food taste better. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at the cheesecake factory. We sat outside an the weather was great. The food was excellent. I had the shrimp and chicken gumboo....hummm humm.  Goood!!! My hubby had the flip flop salmon special. As usual he is not sure of the item but I know it was a special. It was great. The waitress was good, but we ordered drinks and had to ask if they were coming before or after we finished the food....lol  The Mai Tai made it...an it was gr8. We will definitely return as the summer time has a shorter wait time."}
{"text":"Have tried calling a million times. There phone line is litterally not available? Its like its disconnected. I can't find hours for christmas eve anywhere. I was excited to go here but if they cant even figure out how to give their patrons some simple information I really dont want to see how the service is run. Buh bye."}
{"text":"You know those people who keep telling you how great a place is and will not leave you alone till you try it? I suggest telling them to back off LOL or at least I should have in this case. Cheese cake that creamy, dreamy, diet ending evil little creation is what this place \"claims to do best\". WRONG!!!!!!!

Over priced ($7 for a slice) and just not good tasting in any way. The crust was soggy and the filling was like a cross between that jello cheese cake stuff and a box cake mix. Weird! They offer several flavors to choose from but I had the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. The banana extract they use reminded me of the syrup from a snow cone. It over powered the whole slice of cheesecake. Also not sure how much sugar they use but it was way to sweet. Bottom line if you are looking for a decent store bought cheesecake try Safeway or Costco. 

I know they are a chain but this is one of those times were a factory closure would be a good thing!"}
{"text":"Husband ordered the Tacos. I had the Eggplant Parmesan. Oh My Goodness it was a huge portion and very tasty. I could not finish it! It was like eating a lasagna without meat. Very well put together. 

Didn't take photos of the desserts because we took it to go. They were equally as delicious."}
{"text":"Took 9 family members tonight for dinner. We got there at 3:00pm but didn't get seated until 5:00pm. They were honest when I checked in and told me it would be 2 or 2 1/2 hour wait so I can't fault them for that. There was several different types of food ordered and all of it was good. But I ordered a NY Strip steak and it was not as good as I expected it to be I rate it on the low end of good. The interaction of the family was great and most cleaned their plates. The desert cheesecake was outstanding. The service was very good Angel B did an outstanding job serving and her personality was bright and cheerful."}
{"text":"Today I went to this Cheesecake Factory for brunch. An event was being coordinated by the Wounded Warrior Project organization and I was to meet with other wounded warriors for a little what I thought was a meet and greet. Once I met the coordinator, she mentioned there were to be 70 attendees. Yes. Seven, zero. I braced myself for the worst.

At the strike of ten the doors opened and the games began. But what happened threw me off in a good way. The manager asked for the party of 70 right off the bat and immediately had us seated in a very large area of the restaurant designated just for our event. Servers were swarming, the manager was always present, water pitchers were pouring.  Good things were happening and I was truly impressed. I don't know if they had a pep talk in the back before we came in the door and said something like,\"There is a group of 70 combat injured guests and their families coming in today. Get them whatever they want and do whatever they ask\" because that is exactly what I felt like was happening. First class service.

Now the food. I grabbed the Monte Cristo brunch sandwich which was egg, ham, bacon, and Swiss cheese between two thick pieces of French toast and dusted with powdered sugar. It was just as salty and sweet as you can imagine it was. It was in fact to sweet for me. Thankfully, my wife was having the Baja Chicken Hash meal which was \"Two Crisp Tortillas Topped with Chicken Chorizo, Poblano Chiles, Potatoes, Corn, Peppers, Onions and Cheese. Topped with Eggs and Hollandaise Sauce.\"  I copied that from the website so hopefully they don't care but I can't explain all of what was in the meal. It was simply awesome. It was spicy and hearty with the hash browns and I loved it. So my wife and I switched dishes and were officially set. My daughter had a three pancake and bacon meal which she loved. Simple palate simply pleased. One thing to note. The orange juice was truly fresh squeezed and along with the pulp even had that slight bitter rind taste to go with it. The virtual cherry on top of the breakfast. Really, truly, good.

It all really came together. 70 of us sat down and there was not a single beat missed by the staff this morning. My coffee and water never went empty. My food came promptly piping hot and tasty. There was a smile on everybody's face and I met some other great Americans and their families. I have been to this Cheesecake Factory in the past and had good service but maybe a little unremarkable. Today was an opportunity for this location to shine and indeed it did."}
{"text":"I love cheese cake, and I normally love the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to this location multiple times and have never really had a bad experience until just recently. My family and I ordered take out from here one night, an order that totaled over $90. Out of four different plates we orders, three of them were incomplete. The two chicken Caesar salads had barely any chicken on them, and they didn't even give the Caesar dressing for them; I ordered a burger and side salad for my meal, and I was only given the burger NO SALAD!!! Upon calling the restaurant back, we received an apology and offer of a gift card for accommodation. When we received the card in the mail, it was a $15 gift card... $15 on a $90 order that messed up 3 of the 4 meals! I'm not over here trying to sound ungrateful, but a $15 gift card wouldn't even cover one of the incomplete meals ordered. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much like all the other locations.  

The service was fine.  I didn't care for the snarky comments from the waiter about the amount of water I drink."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars not due to its delicious foods (actually, they are just so-so, especially for its free bread) but it is the place where the man I love becomes my boyfriend. We ate together, shared interesting stories in the past and spent a very good night there. We ordered Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta, Filet Mignon, Clam Chowder Soup and 100% Fresh Orange Juice. This place witnessed a very important moment in my life."}
{"text":"Thank you to our waiter Habib for making our night great and putting up with our wild family! We were lucky to have him!"}
{"text":"The mighty ol' cheesecake factory. 

Wait Time:
My friend and I arrived on a Saturday at 12:10pm. She was given a buzzer and we were quoted 1 hour and 10 mins. We walked around the mall and it was 1:45pm and realized that we haven't been called/buzzed yet. We went to the resto and they told us that they buzzed us but the signal might've been weak or it may have not reached where we were. 

We stayed at Nordstorm while waiting. It would be nice if they told us to stay within a distance, considering it was our first time. After coming back, the host said that we will get the the next seat. We didn't wait long - we were seated at 2pm.

Service:
Our server's name is Sierra. She was lovely and pleasant. She greeted us at the table and made sure that we had water at all times. Room for improvement is quality check on patrons. Once we got our dish, she didn't ask how it was for our appetizer and mains (only when we had our dessert).  Other than that, she was friendly and a good server.

Food:
Appetizer - Calamari: OMG, SO DELICIOUS & HUGE PORTION! I've tried so many calamaris in my life. The batter is flavourful and the sauce is good. Classic dish.

Main - Chicken Bellagio: HUGE PORTION. It was great and filling! Comes with 2 big pieces of chicken and pesto pasta underneath along with prosciutto. 

Dessert - Hershey Cheesecake and Mango Key Lime Pie: Both cheesecakes did not disappoint. It was so soft and it wasn't too sweet.

Overall, I had an awesome time here despite of the wait. Huge portions and decent pricing. Must try!"}
{"text":"This location is very convenient because it's inside the forum shops at Caesars Palace and behind the aquarium is the show depicting the Roman gods statutes. 

The food was good and the service great."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for a table while people were being seated that came in after us. I saw two other party's leave because they had to wait. The hostess was bitchy, never once smiled nor did she have any type of customer service skills. Be on the lookout for Alexis the rude hostess. The manager; Caesar, had no idea how to handle customer service either. When he told us the hostess made a mistake he never apologized and just simply said you will have to wait. WOW. We have been going to this restaurant for many years. People don't return because of the poor service and treatment and you can count us out. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We've been to this location multiple times over the years.  The food is typically delicious and service great.  The biggest problem is getting a table. Our most recent experience was a Saturday night during dinner time with a group of 10. We understand that makes it more difficult, but the restaurant didn't handle it correctly. We were told the wait for a table would be 45-50 minutes, but we're not seated until over an hour and twenty minutes elapsed. The worst part was that it was clear that the restaurant was not properly staffed for a Saturday night. They had an entire section of tables empty while the lobby was full of people waiting.  We suspect that the kitchen was understaffed because f he amount of time it took to get food out. Again, food was delicious and waiter was great but the mismanagement of the staffing is almost enough to make me not want to come back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad dish here!  Not to mention the amazing desserts!  I absolutely love their avocado rolls.  The only negative part is that their menu is so extensive that it makes it very difficult to choose.  Love the atmosphere and the food.  A must place to try!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. My wife has taken me a few times when she lived in CA and we've driven to the one in Milwaukee. She was excited when this location opened and I think she should be.

We went here on a Friday night for dinner with two other couples. It was not surprisingly jam packed. We came at 6pm and we were told it was a 2-hour wait, but we were seated in one hour. Pretty impressive.

The atmosphere is pretty loud, which is perfectly fine for our group since we love a good laugh and have tons of energy. 

Our server was Joe. He was above average and answered any questions and concerns we had, especially with our orders. Big points. He gave us enough attention and refilled water without 'being in the way.'

Our food was delicious. My wife ordered their special, which was salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli in a lemon cream sauce with mushrooms. I ordered their BBQ burger which I've previously enjoyed in the past. I asked for it to be cooked medium and it was more medium-rare, but better than well-done like other establishments. No complaints, really. Everyone else enjoyed their meals: jambalaya, miso salmon, some other burger, and another chicken dish. 

The cheesecakes were the cherry on top. My wife and I shared a Snickers cheesecake. Our slice seemed smaller than everyone else's, but Joe explained it well enough that certain cheesecakes are made differently, etc. For instance, the Dream Extreme (oreo cheesecake) is pretty massive, but a big part of it is the chocolate cake piece. I had a taste of the Tiramisu cheesecake: my wife loved it, I could care less for it. It was too strong in my opinion. Our friend loved her vanilla bean cheesecake. 

With their 400 page menu and delicious desserts, we're planning to come back here again and explore their food some more."}
{"text":"After shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter, it's lunch time at the Cheesecake Factory. 

Their lettuce wraps with peanut sauce, is TASTY starter. 

ALWAYS ONE OF MY FAVORITES..."}
{"text":"I love cheesecake and have probably eaten here 50+ times. People are intimidated by their huge menu, but you can really just close your eyes, flip through the pages, and pick a dish. Everything is good here. My go to dishes are : factory nachos, avocado eggrolls, stuffed chicken tortillas (corn cakes are amazing!), Louisiana chicken pasta, and thai chicken lettuce wraps. I don't think I've ever finished my entree because the portions are enormous. The cheesecakes are obviously amazing. Favorites include: godiva cheesecake, pineapple upside cheesecake, apple strudel, and smores. Again, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time till I realized they use trans fat in everything!!!!!!

They use as much if not more than fast food places!!

1,560 calories and 84g of fat for their carrot cake, and 1080 cal, 71g fat, and 100 carbs for a slice of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake.  And those are far from being the only unhealthy items on the menu. Seemingly innocent entrees like salads and sugar free cheesecake can also be calorie-packed diet-wreckers. For example, rumor has it that The Cheesecake Factory's Chinese Chicken Salad clocks in at about 1,600 whopping calories. And the 6 Carb Original Cheesecake has 610 calories and 57g of fat. 

Disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Alfredo fettuccine plus a cheesecake? Is that even legal? Haha well I had both! Always a great time there fast and friendly and the food is always great.  Just thinking about it makes me hungry! Customer service is top notch. And the place a warm and inviting setting. I'll be there back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great service and menu! Good for kids or couples. So many cheesecakes to choose from. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went on a monday night hoping it wont be as busy, and when we walked over to their host booth. They handed us a buzzer and told us 1 hour and 45 minutes and we have to be in a certain vicinity. So we walked around mall and then went down and had some drinks at pickle barrell. About an hour and 15 minutes later the buzzer went off earlier than expected- which we thought was delightful. However the hostess accidentally somehow buzzed everyone on the list and there was a giant queue of confused people. They fixed the error rather quickly and we were told there is another 25 minute wait. So we just kind of stood around the bar and the buzzer went off- but at least i know why they always fighting at cheese cake!! ( please ignore lame attempt to make a drake reference).

I tried the stuffed cheeseburger and it was delicious with chedder oozing out the middle and also started off with the spring roll platter that came with a choice of salmon, chicken, avacado and ground beef spring rolls with different dipping sauces. They were all good. Unfortunately i had loaded up on beer while waiting for so long that i had no room for cheesecake at the cheesecake factory.

Till next time i guess."}
{"text":"The burrito and fried cauliflower was sooo  good! My husband sent his Jamican chicken back. It was not to his liking. However, he is Jamaican so he had high hopes lol."}
{"text":"I have not been disappointed with this restaurant.  The quality of food and alcoholic drinks are always top notch.  I ordered the blended Georgia Peach and for my appetizer I got fried zucchini.  Zucchini is one of my favorite vegetables.  I ordered the lunch portion of the Pasta Da Vinci. Another delectable dish. I try not to order the same dish twice.  The only thing I didn't do that I normally do when I attend the restaurant is order CHEESECAKE!!! I shall return for my slice!"}
{"text":"The reason for this rating is due to the small size of the restaurant and the lack of a waiting area. There's people trying to eat and people are waiting over them. Whomever did the design of this restaurant in particular did not take into account the number of people who frequent this area. Cheesecake Factory is a popular chain that a plethora of people enjoy. I will probably not come to this location due to thr lack of waiting and standing over people while they are eating."}
{"text":"I always love my experience at The Cheesecake Factory! Although the food may seem a little pricey, it is definitely worth the money! The wait staff are always very attentive and the food is delicious. I always get the Chicken di Pana and I'm impressed every time. And their cheese cake is to die for! I love the Cheesecake Factory!!!!"}
{"text":"This location has totally redeemed my opinion of Cheesecake Factory. Not only did I have wonderful friendly service but the food quality was absolutely devine. 

For lunch I had an appetizer of avocado eggrolls (10/10 crunchy, savory and fresh) and for lunch a club sandwich with a side salad (10/10 absolutely perfect)

Really enjoyed the food and experience and can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here forever. It was well worth the wait and everything I hoped it would be. Awesome waiter, the food was incredible, and not overly pricy for all you get. To end the meal we got a red velvet cheesecake. We told the waiter when we first for there that we were celebrating our anniversary.  When he brought the cheesecake it had happy anniversary written in chocolate sauce on the plate. Totally awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't really like cheesecake factory. they have an amazing caesar salad but other than that i don't like anything.

their strawberry shortcake is made with biscuits. what is that all about? way to ruin strawberries.

I do have to agree with Lorena that it is great for groups and the servers are usually pretty awesome"}
{"text":"Wow, love this place, but today it was awful, carbonara pasta was no cream all grease, hubby's Shepard pie was swimming in oil! Love to come for my birthday here food always so good, not today, taste like weekend leftovers! So disappointed, guess won't be coming back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Tonight 's dining experience May 6,2017 is such a joke. We waited 40minutes to get the table, and when we finally did, we waited another 50minutes for the food to come out. Needless to say every order coming out at different time.

Ahi tartare was too sour, chicken Samosas had lack of favor. Also, the Salmon Entree, meatball and spaghetti, Seared Shrimp with Angel Hair were worse than what I can actually make at home. 

The whole bill was $100 with tip, and we left feeling ripped off and unsatisfied! 

We will never come back! First time and also last time!"}
{"text":"Why does everyone hate on the Cheesecake Factory? I like privately owned, farm to table, tapas as much as the next food snob, but I like The Cheesecake Factory. And a lot of other (maybe not food snobs) do too. How do I know this? Try getting a table anytime and see how long the wait is. Try getting a table on a Friday/Saturday or even a seat at the bar OR even a seat in their waiting area and it'll take an hour (at least). So that's annoying, but you can also make reservations or do take out. And it's not like you weren't warned. 

Anyway, I like the food. I've enjoyed most of the appetizers and entrees I've had. I've also had maybe 20 Oreo cheesecake slices in the last three years so hopefully that tells you something about the (Oreo) cheesecake. Occasionally someone I'm with doesn't like their food, but that's not typically what happens.

Besides the wait, the service occasionally leaves something to be desired. My last interaction was over the phone for take out and it was pretty good, except this awkward moment where I said \"can I have the Americana burger sub a veggie patty?\" And the lady on the other end goes \"do you just want the veggie burger?\" And in my head I was an a**hole and responded with 'No, that's why I asked for the Americana burger.' Externally, I realized she thought I might have missed the veggie option on the menu (or maybe they try to discourage substitutions) and responded with a proper \"No thanks, I would like the Americana burger with a veggie patty.\" And, if anyone is wondering- I've had the Americana burger with a veggie patty maybe four times now and have been satisfied with my choice of entree and restaurant each time. 

The well drinks are also good, but keep in mind if you order a specialty cocktail it will have at least half the amount of alcohol you expect for twice the price."}
{"text":"Amazing wait staff at this location. Great atmosphere and exceptional food! We always make the drive to this location over the other ones because of their amazing service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Cheesecake Factory late last night for a date night. It wasn't our first time there, but it was by far our best time. We were seated right away and was welcomed with smiles. Our server's name was Aiden and he was AWESOME. So funny and personable. Very informative. Right away he told us of the specials and the soups of the day. He gave us great recommendations and both my husband and I tried something new on the menu. He even talked us into getting his favorite cheesecake: white chocolate and raspberry!!! It was amazing. Thank you Aiden for a really nice night"}
{"text":"Even though the service was below par and the wait was long for the food, the scrumptious food and amazing presentation at a good value more than make up for it."}
{"text":"I travel all around the country and have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory in L.A, San Diego, San Francisco, Chicago, Hawaii, Florida, and other areas. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants in the country. They have an extensive menu, and everything I have ever ordered has always been delicious. I've got to say I was a little nervous to come to the Madison location because of all the negative reviews I saw on Yelp, but I'm happy to say that this Cheesecake Factory is on par with all the rest I have been to. Excellent, friendly service, and great food. I did not get to have the desert tonight, but I'm sure that is also as great as it is at other locations. I will be back again this week while I am in the Madison area, and I hope to have room for desert then :)"}
{"text":"Today is my mom's birthday so I bought the cake 59 dollar. They said cake ll b ready in 5 mins after that I don't know what's going on I have to wait forever they said they don't have a box for cake. I can't imagine what I got from them...I called manager and he treat me really bad. Cuz I look like kid...but doesn't matter ok!!!! I don't need free stuff just learn how to treat nice to customer!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times in past years and loved the fare, but recently it's taken a turn for the worse. The deserts will always be great, but you should eat your hot meals somewhere else-- maybe at a different Cheesecake Factory. The portions have shrunk (but the price sure hasn't), and sometimes the food isn't quite what's advertised in the menu (missing ingredients). The service is so-so. That leaves the patron wondering where all the money is going, if it's not showing up in the diner's experience. Very mediocre describes this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered two iced teas, took over 15 min and just decided to leave because apparently they are hard to make. Sad service for being inside caesars palace. Waiter didn't know the prices of drinks either. Tried to say mojitos were 15 bucks each but he \"wasn't sure\". Whatever, won't come back."}
{"text":"The hostess was polite and sat us in the amount of time she allotted for our wait. The service was attentive, not personal, but we received our food as ordered and in a reasonable time. The portions of food were good except for my order of the seared ahi. For $20 I got a bunch of rice that was closer to hard than soft and four slivers of tuna that belonged on an appetizer platter or with a salad. I was highly disappointed in my meal, still hungry and everyone else's leftovers. My sister and son shared fettuccine alfredo with shrimp that was yummy and my cousin ordered a chicken tender dish that was probably the whole damn chicken. I was the only one that got the short end of the stick but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for a table even with reservations, and this was a thursday evening. The food is good, huge menu selection with unique items. The dishes are over-priced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Just had lunch. Always great food and even better service. The Bartender remembered my name from last time. Took my order, my drink came fast and bread came out right after. It was warm, which allowed the butter to melt. Love that. Then my food came out. The herb salmon is always amazing. Fresh food. Made my day so much better."}
{"text":"This location just isn't the same experience for me as others.   I keep going back but I think I've finally given up.   They had an ant issue a few visits ago.    I was sitting near the window watching a dream of ants walk along the window seal.    Then we returned on a holiday and it was busy.   We were seated at a table that had food still underneath and on the seats.   They cleaned the seats after we asked, but my feet were trying to find a space in between what was on the floor.  Last night my menu was wet and sticky.   Like there was a quick half hearted wipe with a rag.   For desert we ordered the fresh strawberries.   They looked dead.   We basically just stopped eating them because why?   The strawberries at home in my fridge that I bought three days ago were much fresher.   They just seem too busy to keep up and handle the crowd that comes there."}
{"text":"Great service, nice seating outside. Friendly staff. Would visit again. Came for appetizers."}
{"text":"We live here in Vegas and there's a Cheesecake Factory maybe 10 mins away from my house but we drive all the way to the strip to come to this location! And especially for our waitress, Daisy. I always ask for her, she's amazing! Very nice staff! I've only had one so-so experience there after being there a lot! Food is always fresh and tastes good! Pretty good on refilling the drinks quickly! Love this location keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I do love the Cheesecake Factory. You can't really go wrong here, Pretty much every dish is gonna be good. I had the Mac & Cheese Burger. FANTASTIC! Just picture a juicy savory burger topped with a patty made of Mac & Cheese. I loved it.

My only complaint is the menu is too big! Takes me forever to pick something, Everything sounds soo good. Not a bad problem to have."}
{"text":"Ambience was very good.. It was noisy and crowdy.. Had imperial chicken and bang bang chicken.. Liked the food.. However it was little costly.. Definitely go for cheesecake, very yummy"}
{"text":"Tonight, we came here for a late birthday celebration for a friend. While we were here, the waiter must have overheard our conversation talking about how it was her birthday. Once we were finished we ordered cheesecake, and they brought over a decorated plate and extra people to sing. I just couldn't believe how much detail our server Ryan paid attention to!! He made the dinner extra special! :)"}
{"text":"Food is as expected, not over-the-top great but not disappointing. Portions are big and I think that's their signature. Had enough to eat for lunch and packed the leftovers for dinner. I wasn't too impressed with their cheeseburger spring rolls. Fish tacos could also used a bit more seasoning. 

So was it worth the wait to get in? Maybe, if you've never been, just to check that off your bucket list. But, don't set high expectations on the food. Alternatively, if you're told to wait a few hours it'd be faster to drive to Walden Galleria mall in Buffalo to eat at the Cheesecake Factory location there! 

Tip: I've been told you can ask to sit at the bar to get seated more quickly. 

Another tip: if you REALLY want to go, pick a weekday and go between 2-3pm when it's slowest (even then you'll have to queue)."}
{"text":"I alway have a love/hate relationship with Cheesecake Factory. I love their food but I hate that you can't make a reservation, the waits is alway forever, and the portion is alway so damn big. 
On the cold Sunday, it's no different. We were excited to have brunch at Cheesecake. Arrived at 12:30. Didn't get seated til 1:45pm but our waitress couldn't take our orders til after 2pm so we missed our brunch deadline! So I opted for small plates of chicken samosas and the crab cakes balls. Both were very salty. Therefore, I couldn't finish it. My usual herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes was great. The kids love their options. All in all. Service was great. Our food took a long time to get to us as usual due to how busy they are. And it's nothing new there. But again, our server was doing the best she can!"}
{"text":"So this is my 5th time coming here. We have been trying different appetizers when coming to find out which taste better and which will be our favorite. I already found my favorite dish. 

Not much of a fan 
-So the soup is not that great maybe I should try it again one day. 
-The Buffalo wings are okay. Nothing spectacular. 
-Fried zucchini is not really that fried how I like it, it's just like a sprinkle of crusted stuff on it. 
-Also the fried mozzarella is good but they don't give you a lot. 

Definitely should try 
-1st of all the bread is amazing!!!
-So we just tried the roadside sliders and man they were delicious! Soft & delicate. Also served with lettuce and tomato on the side. Definitely recommend it! They come in 4.
-Also we ordered the Buffalo blast. Those were also delicious! Definitely recommend especially cause there's 10 pieces! It's like stuffed chicken and cheese inside and Buffalo (batter) on the outside served with ranch & Buffalo sauce on the side.
-also the alfredo is good"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations. People are always bragging online about how they ate at the Cheesecake Factory and they take pictures of their food with Instagram filters. I thought it'd be overrated and regular but I actually enjoyed myself.

There isn't a Cheesecake Factory here in AK so I had to give it a try while I was in Vegas. Ordered their Ribeye Steak medium rare with Mac & cheese and Mash potatoes. I judge a lot of restaurants based off of their ability to cook steak correctly. I'm no snob or highly experienced chef but cooking steak isn't exactly easy so if a restaurant can cook a steak properly, it gets major kudos from me. They not only cooked my steak perfectly but even the cut itself was of high quality. Maybe I'm exaggerating but it tasted and looked perfect. The mac & cheese was gooey goodness and the potatoes was good also. I ordered an Oreo Cheesecake to go which was fancy smancy yumminess but I expected that considering the name of the place. I wish we had one up here and I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday celebration. The wait wasn't too long, about 15 minutes on a Sunday night. We ordered 5 different meals, and not one of them was worth the money or the visit. Pasta was hard and dry on one meal, the chicken was almost nonexistent on the salad with chicken, the burger was overdone, the catfish was ok but not very plentiful. The catfish actually looked like fried chicken. The children's pizza was probably the best thing ordered. Service was spotty. I don't know if our server  was overloaded with tables or what.  The complimentary birthday sundae was good. Overall, none of us were impressed with the food or service and don't plan to return."}
{"text":"So I'm just gonna start off by saying I obviously didn't try the whole menu because well that would be to much but I apparently tried crowd favourites which I thought would've been suitable for my palette but they weren't. The raspberry lemonade was good, the two apps were pretty good nothing crazy which were the roadside sliders and the Nashville hot nuggets I believe this is why the rating got a 3. My entree's (2) were sub par I guess? But I couldn't eat them the hibachi steak was served beautifully until I tasted how sweet the sauce was which over powered everything I couldn't continue to eat it. The second would've been the Factory combination I got the chicken and shrimp scampi... the scampi was by far the weirdest I've tasted with the same breading they use on everything fried which was odd, the chicken almost had the same sauce as the hibachi steak that again over powered everything I really tried to like it and I couldn't and sent it back and I was done. But my boyfriend enjoys the truffle chicken, I mean for me its better then the two I got but not something I would order. Great customer service. Slow food service but that could be since it's fairly still new and a high capacity. I mean I would try it again something different for sure."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious, portion size was breathtaking! One of the best fries I have had in a long time. Definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this Cheesecake Factory long before I moved to Las Vegas. The multiple levels is a architectural design element not seen in other restaurants, but is necessary because they get so much traffic. It is located at the very end of The Forum Shops commected to Caesars Palace.

Having to wait to get in and the long journey it takes to get to this location from the casino, are the only two drawbacks. Everything else, including the staff and food have always been good.

It is near a large aquarium and an animatronic show with fire and water, so those help to pass the time. If you are walking around Las Vegas and want to enjoy a nice dinner from a restaurant you know, try this one out."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory, located in the Caesar Shops was a wonderful place for lunch .  We had a Factory Nacho Plate and a Fig and Bleu Cheese Flatbread which were both eye-catching and delicious!
We were also served a basket of warm, tasty bread with fresh butter. As a bonus we were able to dine outside which allowed us to enjoy the large aquarium and the Roman God animated display which is a well-known part of Caesar's Palace."}
{"text":"Service was really good.  Food was a little bland to my taste but every one else in my party enjoyed their own orders.  Seated quickly and was pleased with the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Two of us went in on a week night for an early dinner. We were greeted and seated very quickly to our own little section. Our waiter was prompt to the table to take our drink order but that was the last time. Drinks came very quick after the long delay of telling us it was not available. Not usually a big deal except it was the one advertised on the menu! Ordered the soup and only after 15 minutes after finishing the bread, it arrived. The tortilla soup was very good. But the slow refill made the soup spice linger a little longer. Food finally arrived after the table that sat after us received theirs. We got the Burrito Grande and the Chicken Belligio. The food made up for the wait. 

We got the Snickers Cheesecake to go. It was good of course but was just normal cheesecake with a chocolate crust and snickers ice cream topping on top.  It had just enough sweetness to it. 

Will be back again but a little shocked at the slow service during a slow time."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday. Lao salad and chicken burrito. Fantastic. What is amazing that no Mather what Cheesecake Factory I am in the dressing taste the same. What is their recipe? I wish I knew."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory.. at the Premium Vegas outlets........ WOW long walk to get to it but worth it. It was our first time amd 2 of us had the small burger and salad. We both agreeded the burger was TOPS! The salad lacked color, just a big bowl of green. Our other party had a philly sandwich. STEAK KNIVES NEEDED.  The bread  was hard to cut. Over all it was FANTASTIC! Going back for dinner one day!"}
{"text":"The food and services is awesome, but the line up is really big we spend more than 2 hours to get a table. Recommendation get the table early. Or Use Delivery Service. Cheesecake line up is better for take out. Classic and Oreo are my favourite."}
{"text":"I love the new skinnylicious menu!  I had the Tuna Tataki salad and it was amazing!  We went specifically for the low carb cheesecake, which is delicious.  It is a bit pricey but worth it to me."}
{"text":"Food was great, as usual. Service at this one, could be better. I believe they only take reservations for large parties during slow times (during the week). I called ahead and made reservations for my birthday last week since I had all my family coming to celebrate. They said they had me marked down. I got there and they told me there were no reservations under my name for that night. The lady at the front tried to give me a hard time. Luckily it was on a Wednesday night, so it didn't take them too long to get some tables together for us. Our waitress was friendly and nice. Wish she would've came and checked on us more tho. Overall, wasn't the best service for a Cheesecake Factory as I've been to all of them around town."}
{"text":"I came here 2 days in a row for national cheesecake day and half price cheesecake. I was going to write my review Sunday, but I'm glad I waited because my Sunday experience was HORRIBLE, like 2 star bad, but my Monday experience was great, 5 star great. I averaged them out to give this review. 

Sunday: We came in for cheesecake, but since we had to dine in, we git some breakfast that I didn't know they served on Sundays. The service we got the whole time was absolutely horrible. There weren't many people there when we got there so we didn't wait long to be seated. She brought us water and that was about it. The rest of the time we had to keep flagging her down to get anything from her. It took 15 minutes to get our coffee and actually order our food. Then she never came back. It took 30 minutes before we could flag her down to actually get us some bread that we had to actually ask for when everybody else was just given their bread. She was definitely not off to a good start. She kept going back and forth to the table next to us, giving them stuff and checking on them, but never came to us, unless we actually flagged her down and yelled for her. To me, that's not acceptable customer service. It almost made us not ever want to come back here. Only reason we came back, was to get more half price cheesecake the next day. We made sure we weren't going to get her the next day again, by sitting at the bar on Monday.

Monday: We strictly went to the bar in hopes we'd get better service. We certainly did. We initially came for happy hour drinks and cheesecake, but ended up ordering some appetizers for dinner since the happy hour menu is pretty cheap. Thank god we had good service at the bar or we probably never would've went back. Our bartender was always checking on us to see if we needed anything, constantly refilling our drinks, conversating with us, after everybody was taken care of. We even got our bread this time right away and didn't even have to ask for it. And to top it off, we got great service during happy hour when the whole place was packed and every seat was taken. 

Now, onto the actual food. 

For breakfast, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles Benedict and the chilaquiles carnitas. I really enjoyed the Benedict. It definitely had a unique sweet flavor that I wasn't expecting, but it was delicious. The carnitas was a bed of tortilla chips with a green chilli pork mix over them. I wasn't a fan of them, but my boyfriend enjoyed them. We also ordered their new cheesecakes: the celebration cheesecake and the coffee and cream cheesecake. The celebration one wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It was SUPER sweet. My complaint is that there was very little cheesecake in it. It was almost all cake and a cream mousse stuff. I was hoping it was going to be majority cheesecake, but it wasn't. I can't say that is order it again. The coffee and cream one, was very chocolatey with coffee. If you like those two flavors, you'll like that cheesecake. 

For happy hour, I started off with the JW pink lemonade that was pretty good. We ordered 3 appetizers to share: Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, factory nachos and the buffalo blasts. They were all great. You won't be disappointed with any of them. They are pretty big servings so be careful how much you order. We couldn't even finish the nachos. Then we ordered cheesecake to go because there was no way we had room to eat there. We got the chocolate hazelnut crunch, Chris' outrageous, mango key lime and Reeses peanut butter. I didn't like Chris' because I don't like coconut or walnuts, but if you like them and almond joy, you'll love that one. My boyfriend loved it so much, he ate the whole thing in one sitting. I really enjoyed the other three tho. The hazelnut crunch is really good. The Reeses is really rich, but great if you like chocolate and peanut butter. The mango cheesecake us really tart, but great if you like those flavors."}
{"text":"I've always had mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory.

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's \"BurGR\". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

Absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This location is a hot mess.  I love the Cheese Cake Factory but this locaton is not up to the standards that I accustomed to from this company.  Choose another location The waitress smelled like a pack of cigarettes.  So standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn.  Then my rice was undercooked.  When I told them it was undercooked they wanted to question me and say are you sure.  Im Asian I eat rice almost everyday.  There were Nat's flying around the food.  I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"This is our first time going to this place. It was a good experience. The service and food were excellent. The dessert was expensive but it was very good. We may have pick a better day (Monday) with less crowd and food was cooked quickly enough for our kids that most days lose their patient."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and we were not waiting around forever to obtain a table between the lunch and dinner crowd. Still busy mind you! We chose the interior dining area this time and immersed ourselves in the lunch selections. MAN, this place has it all. HUGE menu. How do they do it all so well?
For $11.50 I chose a pasta special - spicy chipotle chicken. It was really good although the chicken was quite dry. I wish they would carry a lunch special with shrimp in it! The sauce was just enough and although it claims to be spicy, it is not so to people like me!
Our waiter was professional, pleasant and down-to-earth. 
Very casual dining here.
My biggest complaint was the music playing. Awful, back to the era of Huckleberry Finn."}
{"text":"Great options on the menu! Everything is super tasty and fresh!
My kids love the kids menu!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times before and, unfortunately, I've noticed a decline in quality over the years.  My most recent experience at the Chandler location hit rock bottom.  I was here with two friends and everything just seemed to go wrong.  No joke, at some point during the meal all three of us had to send our meals back to the kitchen (something that none of us had ever done before).  One friend received her meal about ten minutes before the rest of us (she didn't want to be the only person eating so her meal got cold).  When my other friend got her tacos, they included an ingredient that she specifically asked to be omitted for allergy reasons.  The highlight of the evening was what I found in my chicken Madeira .  What I thought was a burnt mushroom, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a piece of CARDBOARD!  Bizarre, right?!?  On a positive note, the food itself (when we finally got it ~14 minutes later) was tasty and the waitstaff was very apologetic.  For our troubles, we were comped the dinner, but I'm not sure that'll be enough to make me revist the Cheesecake Factory any time soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to eat for our date night dinner. We sat outside enjoying the nice weather. Unfortunately, we sat at our table for 15mins and were never greeted by our server. My boyfriend went inside to find out who it was going to be and none of the employees even looked at him! I went in after and waited for the hostess to ask her about it. She sent out our server who explained it was a shift change, it was right before 5pm, so she didn't know they sat us. That's understandable but more organization and communication would have started our dinner off on a better foot. After that our server was efficient and attentive. The fried zucchini starter was very good but our entrees were okay (shrimp basket and chicken di pana). The cheesecake is delicious here. I really go to this establishment solely for the cheesecake."}
{"text":"How many times has this location served bang bang shrimp with only 6 pieces of shrimp. Forget that they have diverse menu n decent service so we end up there after the mall.
Long story short, frozen n chewy shrimp the last few times I have eaten there. Today this happened again. If you can't afford the dish with good quality meat/ shrimp then please take it off your menu rather than serving stale n expired frozen shrimp in your food. Customers have other choices. One or two bad experiences can be excused but not repeatedly. That shows your food quality standards have fallen."}
{"text":"I came here with my family yesterday (group of 5). It was a 15 minute wait which wasn't horrible and then they called us up. We came up to the hostess stand and just stood there waiting for about 5 minutes. I finally asked the hostess why she would call us up if our table wasn't ready. The hostess supervisor overheard me and got involved....apparently what happened was the hostess seated another smaller party at the table set for our group. We watched the hostess go up to the newly seated group which had been seated for about 5 minutes, and KICK THEM OUT of the booth. I felt horrible for the other group. This started the slow and unimpressive meal  :/

Our waiter was just kinda sloppy. He was REALLY SWEATY (like just ran a marathon sweaty and sweat rolling down his face and neck) and unorganized. He had no idea what was on the menu-for example, someone ordered Moroccan Chicken, he asked her if she wanted mashed potatoes with that or a salad but the dish didn't even come with those items, it came with couscous. He made the same mistake with my MIL's entree choice too.  He then tried to push the brunch options but brunch ended at 2pm so it wasn't even available. He didn't even know what time it was.

The menu itself was FILLED with advertisements for an assortment of crap, very off putting to me as I just want to pick my meal, not be subjected to page after page of crappy ads.  as It took 20 minutes for him to bring bread, 1 HOUR (yes HOUR) for appetizers, another 45 minutes for entrees. I asked him to bring water for our table for everyone, he brought ONE. When we finally got our entrees, they only came out partially. A member of our group was without his entree for a while and was stuck staring at everyone's food. In the 3 HOURS that it took to get everything we ordered, he refilled our drinks once. I ordered a turkey burger and was not impressed.....it needed more flavor, seasoning and the fries were unappetizing and tasted slightly freezer burnt. 

My MIL insisted on dessert so we all got cheesecake (a variety). It took an additional 25 minutes for cheesecake, AS IF it takes 25 minutes to slice a darn cheesecake and plate it?? By the time we had ordered dessert, the place had cleared out for the most part and was NOT busy so there was NO excuse whatsoever for the length of time the service took.

By the end of our meal, we could NOT WAIT to leave. My MIL is very shy and gets embarrassed  easily so I didn't raise a fuss with management but this was my first time dining here and it was so unpleasant. I was hugely disappointed
 with the entire experience. 

Save your cash for a place with better food, better service, perhaps less sweaty servers."}
{"text":"We were celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. The appetizers are big enough to be a meal. Lighting is low so make sure you have a flash light app. Service was good and te server made her cheescake look fabulous and festive."}
{"text":"Amazing.  When we arrived they explained the hour wait and said to come back in about 50 minutes because the pagers only work in the restaurant.  We walked around the mall and then came back in time to get to our reserved time.  Everyone loved their food, the service is impeccable and the cheesecake (or other dessert) is divine.  The menu is a touch overwhelming, but there are options for everyone."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. Definitely not worth the average wait time of 1.5+ hours - unless you REALLY want their cheesecake. But if that's all you want get it to go.

Our family decided to go today on a Saturday morning while doing some Christmas shopping. I was hoping the food would taste as good as it does in the United states. But alas, it did NOT.

We ordered the factory nachos: 5/5 stars - it was LOADED with cheese and had a generous amount of guacamole & jalapenos. Only get it if you like it heavy!

The Dynamite tempura shrimp and Ahi tuna tartare were a disappointment. Did not taste good at all. Both 1/5 stars and costs about $10 each. 

The Philly cheese steak sandwich was 3/5. I've had better, at a fraction of the price.  Do not get the fries as your side!! The fries were hard, cold and tasteless. 

The Diane steak (3/5 stars)was nothing to write home about. And at almost $28, you might as well go to a buffet. 

$100+ later....
We should have just gotten the cheesecake to go."}
{"text":"I thought id try something different from my favorite spot so went for the \"thai salmon \"was super good well seasoned an worth every penny"}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at the Cheesecake Factory, and last night was no exception. There was a huge snowstorm, so we had almost no wait at all (which is a big difference from the usual packed entryway). Without all the people in the way, I was able to fully appreciate how lovely the inside of the restaurant is (reminds me of Disney World!). We were taken to a small table where one side was a chair and the other was a bench that spanned the entire length of the seating area. That's a little weird since you're basically sharing space with complete strangers, but it worked. Our server was extremely friendly and very attentive. The bread that they bring you to stay was warm and delicious as usual. I ordered the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich, which was cooked nicely. The meat was moist, and the buffalo sauce added just the right amount of heat. My only complaint was that the cheese could have been melted for a few seconds longer on top. My boyfriend ordered the \"chicken littles,\" and his plate came HEAPED with chicken... He now has lunch for today! After our entrees, we scanned the extensive dessert menus and couldn't come up with one option we both agreed on since the menu is so vast, so we ordered 2! I got the s'more cheesecake (since I have a new obsession with anything s'more themed) and it was incredible; the chocolate cheesecake with graham cracker crust and gooey marshmallow fluff tasted just like a campfire s'more fancied up. I brought half of it home so I could enjoy it a little longer! Bill ordered the warm apple crisp since he isn't the biggest cheesecake fan, and it came out warm and bubbly with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream topping it off. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with family that was from out of town and we all had the best dinning experience. Our server Katia was very informative with every question we had and just made it an awesome time!!"}
{"text":"It was okay, I don't get the hype and 3 hour wait time. pasta was very very sour, chesse cakes are good and the burger was good actually. Overall it was okay, expensive and  thr wait was long, it was nothing unbelievable."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the Black Plague. Food is good but holy sh** the attitude from the lady at the register in the front is terrible. I'm sure she thought I didn't catch her but I sure did... will NOT return to this location and maybe just opt out of going to Cheesecake Factory in general. 

My .02 cents for her is if you don't like your job. Quit."}
{"text":"The food is always  good and variety to choose from. Love the Chinese  chicken  salad and lettuce  wrap.  The fresh bread with butter is a winner and the avocado  rolls are amazing.  The only negative  is long long waite. It would  be great  if they'll  open another  location"}
{"text":"Service was horrible!! Stay clear from Melissa K- if you're young and not white!! She didn't bother clearing our bread/appetizer plates or anything for that matter!! We had to request for our drink refills (which she couldn't remember what drinks they were). We were done with our meal and HAD to ask for dessert menus. She also forgot to place our appetizer order. She did cater to all the other tables around us tho- filling their drinks and offering them dessert menus while they were still eating.  She was also having conversations with the surrounding tables. Definite slap to our face..
Note to server: DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER, YOU WORK IN LAS VEGAS- YOU'RE TIP REFLECTS YOUR SERVICE!!! WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS LESS THAN SUBPAR!!
Shrimp scampi pasta was very bland."}
{"text":"It's been close to 15 years since I last ate at a Cheesecake Factory, and that was in SF.  I was visiting my sister in Vegas, and apparently they order takeout from here often.  So that's what we did.

I was trying to be \"healthy\" so ordered the Santa Fe Salad.  What was I thinking?  McDonald's makes a really good Santa Fe salad with breaded chicken (probably totally not healthy).  I actually kinda love it, though I don't go to McDs often. I was hoping TCF, with their reputation, would have a version just as good. But no, it was just what I imagine a \"healthy\" salad being.  Lackluster in flavor with not much to recommend it other than the fact that it was relatively healthy.

My sis had the apple pork chops.  She really liked it, though I personally am not a fan of sweet savory.  The mashed potatoes were excellent, which I remember from my visit 15 years ago.

My brother-in-law had the Davinci pasta dish, which is one of the 2 dishes they said they almost always order (the other being the shrimp scampi).  I only had a taste but my god, that was good!  It really didn't look like much because the sauce seemed fairly light, but the flavor was amazing. 

Cheesecake tiramisu. Drool.  I like cheesecake and I like tiramisu but I don't generally love either.  I LOVED the cheesecake tiramisu.  Fluffy and light, all 3 of us agreed this was utterly delicious.

Portions were huge for all the entrees and well worth the price.  If I ever go back to a Cheesecake Factory, I need to remember:  Davinci & cheesecake tiramisu."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and have been to many different locations throughout the states. But this past wkend the service was weird. Our waitress appeared to be drunk or sleepy. It was so bad we asked her to go home. She was falling asleep while taking our orders and her behavior was not the norm for CCF staff. Long story short the  orders were wrong and confused her. (Service for 6) She was replaced with another waiter and we were told she was sent home. So to make us happy we received 3 free cheesecakes and one meal free since it arrived after everyone was finish eating. I can say this was the worst service we have ever had but thank goodness the food remained at its highest quality as we would expect. I must say we did appreciate how fast the managers stepped in to make sure our dining ended on a good note. Becuz we love CCF I can't give it less then 4/5 stars but I will give our waitress a 2 star. Sorry. Hope u get better sleep nxt time u work."}
{"text":"We like the extensive menu.  Most of the items are pretty good.  Some of the items we have tried are truly great.  My personal fav is the Spicy Tie Chicken Pasta (or something like that).  The first time I ordered it I thought it was absolutely perfect:  Nice and spicy, pasta done al dente, some crunchy corn strips for texture...sauce is addictive.  Other times I've ordered it seemed less spicy (but still good).

Also a plus:  service is always courteous, place is always clean."}
{"text":"Went about 6 PM on a Thursday. Took about 20 mins. to get water and bread, which others were given promptly even though they arrived after us. Received our food in a timely matter, we both ordered the meatloaf. Unfortunately, both were burned severely. Our sides were cold. When told about this they microwaved the potatoes and asparagus- Warm initially, and cold again not long after. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory - pretty much everything I usually avoid in a restaurant choice (trendy/chainy/pricey), but, my visiting Norwegian kids wanted to go there.

The bad - 47 page menu - seriously - too many choices!

The good - our server was AWESOME!  She had loads of personality, and saved me having to digest the menu by recommending a couple of good options for me.  Two of the kids got the Imperial Chicken - that was a really good dish.  Wish I had ordered it!  One of the gals got the Caesar Salad - it was huge!  My Norwegian daughter got the orange chicken (I prefer Pei Wei's orange chicken, but she enjoyed it).  I got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - an Indian themed dish - it was quite good, but next time, I'll get the Imperial Chicken.

Then to dessert - cheesecake is a must when you go to the Cheesecake Factory, right?  I got the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake - I'm a dark chocolate fan.  Most everyone got a chocolate, though somebody ordered an Adam's Peanut Butter and we even had someone order a milk shake!

Did I mention our server?  She'd toured with one of the Van Zandt brothers, and had some great road stories - great sense of humor - checked in on us just the right amount, and is the reason for 4 stars instead of 3 (did I mention my aversion to big chain restaurants?)."}
{"text":"Think wisely about when you go eat. We went at the beginning of lunch, trying to beat the rush. We were promptly seated, which was great. However, that is where the good news ended. Our server lacked attentiveness. I fully understand being busy; but she definitely made a judgment call and decided our table didn't merit as much attention as other tables. Our food was not hot and had no flavor (I ordered a chicken avocado club). I informed the server and she shrugged, complained about the kitchen and then went back to her other tables. At no point did she make any offers regarding our poorly prepared food. However, she gave the table next to is free cheesecake because they had the same issue. Look, I don't need free cheesecake, but I expect you to acknowledge a complaint about my meal. She then failed to ask us if we needed anything else.  Instead, she brought our checks and moved on. Poor service. I tipped her more than I should have (she deserved a penny, but I gave 10%). I live in the Southpark area and will never return there.
Also, it took over 2 hours from start to finish. What's worse? I am still hungry because I did not eat my abysmal food."}
{"text":"It's date night with Hunnie Bunnie and we are trying to go to her fave spot, Cheesecake Factory. First I tried Caesar's palace but it was ridiculously busy so we drove all the way out to Henderson. 
Would we like patio seating?? Sure why not, there are heaters outside. It was kind of a cool evening, but the heater really helped keep us warm and the ambiance sitting outside was actually fantastic, with the music playing around the village was a nice touch! 
I dont' know why I stray from my Chicken Chipotle pasta because whenever i do, i am never satisfied! I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp pasta on the Skinnylicious menu. There really isn't any sauce accompanied with this dish so I asked the server for SOME kind of sauce for this... I think she brought me out some alfredo or something. It still wasn't very good. The shrimp were quite large though but this dish just didn't do it for me. 
I must just stick with my Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta! 
Hunnie Bunnie ordered her Mac n Cheese though and enjoyed it very much! And the Red Sangria hit the spot! 
Our server was really nice too - Hunnie Bunnie even asked me why she ALWAYS had a smile on her face like that! I told her it's cuz it's her JOB!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night. The wait was absolutely insane. It was chaos when you walked in, couldn't figure out where the line was and no one else could either, we had to keep telling people. The wait was an hour to an hour and a half. We went to the bar while we waited and seats happened to open up at the bar thankfully! We all got drinks and hung out while we waited. The service at the bar was good at first but then they ignored us and the bar tenders were upset with each other and communication. They would yell at each other because one would give a receipt for another party and they didn't know who to give it to. 

Luckily, we got a booth seat. The lighting was a little too dark, I couldn't see the difference between the onions, garlic, and mushrooms on my plate, which wasn't good for me because I don't like onions or big garlic chunks. Service was quick once we were seated and food came quickly. We ordered drinks and I got the Georgia peach. Delicious!! I could drink them all night. I ordered the combo of shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Both were delicious. I did ask for my steak medium and it was the most well done steak I've ever received. Still good taste, but for the price, I want my steak cooked correctly. This place is nice to come to for occasions. We all got our cheesecake to go. We got cookie dough cheesecake & the s'mores! Very good!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try it after seeing endless lines. We came at around 3pm and we got a seat immediately. It was still lunch time and so they had a list of items under their lunch special which is just smaller portions of some of the things on their menu as they claim that their portions are very big. 

Service was very good as our server would constantly check up on us and brought us bread before we even ordered and even offered to give us more bread. Only thing was that our water wasn't consistently refilled. 

I decided to try the carbonara which comes with bacon and chicken which is an extra cost. I personally wasn't a huge fan as I've had delicious carbonara from other places. It had a very strong garlic taste which I wasn't expecting. I ended up taking my leftovers home and after I microwaved it, the end result was a very big puddle of oil. 

We also got the chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake which was a little of the sweet side. It wasn't anything special and is quite pricey for a slice (~$8 I believe) 

Cheesecake Factory is probably something most people wouldn't crave and would just come if they were hungry or to come with a group of friends as their menu is large."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch. First, I ordered the pear and blue cheese flatbread. Had to send it back because it was inedibly burnt! I also had the chicken taquitos which were edible but chicken was tough. My husband ordered the Lasagna Verde. Plate was loaded with sauce( way too much) , BUT the worse part, after he had eaten half, I noticed PARCHMENT PAPER BETWEEN ONE OF THE LAYERS. Not a small piece but all through it. Sadly hubby didn't notice , but I did! We called the waitress over, she said she didn't know what it was, I asked for a manager( Ashley Mastin), she brushed it off and said she will talk to the kitchen. She asked if we wanted a replacement meal, we refused. She took both items off of the check but refused to take the taquitos off of the bill( I felt she should have just for the aggravation). Will never go back! I only gave it one star because I had to in order to post!"}
{"text":"Chicken Madeira - this tasted great. but the amount of chicken was disappointing considering how expensive it is. 

Garlic pasta- huge portion, nicely cooked, with tons of garlic. 

It's hard to recommend this place for 2 reasons. 
1. It's over priced. 
2. The cheese cake is terrible. I had their \"popular\" new york style, and the crust was mushy and uninspired, and the cheese had an unusual mildly rubbery texture. 

Do not wait for hours to eat here. Remember how silly it was when you saw people line up for hours/days/weeks for the iphone? That's what you look like. 

If you have 3 hours to waste waiting in line, you could literally go to the grocery store and make a cheesecake in less time than it would take to get a seat here."}
{"text":"Outlet Mall. I have Celiac Disease and I ordered Gluten Free Four Cheese w/Chicken Pasta. It tasted great until I finished half of my meal.  See photos.  I specifically told the waiter I had Celiac Disease,  he indicated that he understood. My wife ordered spaghetti,  I would say the same strainer for her spaghetti was used for gluten free noodles.  Behind the scene, cross contamination inevitable.   The manager was apologetic and though I didn't pay monetarily for my meal,  I'll pay physically."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat but defiantly not worth the price!!! My brother and I came here to place a to go order tonight. We ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo and the southern fried catfish. Just before ordering my brother confirmed with one of the employees about the size of the fish fillets in which they replied saying \"the pieces of fish are pretty big.\" The meal came with three thin chicken strip sized pieces of fish that in addition were each very bland. Moving on to my dish, the gumbo, I found the consistency to be very water like and the only flavor that came through was the tomatoes and the few pieces of andouille sausage. However, the rice was cooked nicely and the sides that came with the catfish were fine as well! I could just be very picky because I grew up on catfish Friday's and grandmas gumbo but Cheesecake charged me over 40 dollars for this meal. They could have at least came close to grandmas gumbo and gave me pieces of fish worth the charge of $18."}
{"text":"Big fancy chain restaurant? Big insane menu? Big servings? Small prices? 

Dear Cheesecake Factory, 
Say hello to your newest fan! I always imagined The Cheesecake Factory to be one of those places you go to for a boring corporate meeting or on a date with one of those cheesy guys who believes that this fancy Biltmore location will woo you off your feet (replacement for charm). 

After trying this place out, I have completely changed my mind! The menu was extensive with an impressive variety of plates! I ordered these Vietnamese rice paper rolls that were just as delicious as the ones from the Vietnamese deli down the street. My friends ordered plates that were huge and mouth watering! To top it all off, the prices were extremely low and an exceptional value! I'll be stopping by whenever I'm in a mood to eat beyond my means :) 

The staff was nice, nothing over the top, but with great locations and great values, the service is over shadowed by the food!"}
{"text":"Ive been to the Cheesecake Factory only once a couple years ago in buffalo.. it was alright 

Theres always a huge lineup at the one they opened here & so I was never down for the wait 

To my surprise on a sunday afternoon, i was given a 40 min wait time and got seated in the patio within 15 mins .. 

Our server was amazing. I forgot her name :( she was a brown girl, so helpful with the menu and everything we needed. 

We got the mac & cheese balls (FANTASTIC) and the egg roll sampler which was alright pretty good. 
We also got the stuffed cheddar burger and pasta .. 
both pretty good. 

Overall a fantastic sunday lunch spent on the patio of cheesecake factory. 

Will be back to try ..mm just about everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I visited the Cheesecake Factory for the first time in September of 2016.   I didn't know what to expect, but I was excited as I had been told it was amazing and IT WAS!!!   Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere.    It was beautiful inside and out.   I loved the food and our server was knowledgeable and quick.  I will make the 60 mile drive from my home here Gagarin and again.   My advice, come closer to Canton/New Philadelphia area.   I would show up much more often that way."}
{"text":"The service was slow, the food was cold and not prepared as we requested.  Seriously just a lousy experience overall."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this chain.  We have visited many locations and were very excited when we found out that Madison would be opening one.  We have gone about 3-4 times since it's opened and have been so disappointed each time.

The food is not good...you would think that since it is a chain the food should taste exactly the same at each restaurant.  Every time we have visited this location the food has been bland and just \"off\".  Another reason I am only leaving one star is that the customer service (or lack there of) has been awful.  Even when the restaurant is empty the service has been slow.  The worst experience that we had when eating here was when we came in for an early dinner (5pm) and didn't receive our food until almost 6!  The place was empty so there was absolutely no reason that the food should have been that delayed.  On top of that, our waitress forgot to put in one item from our order.  We complained to the manager and he offered NO apology...simply gave a fake smile and nodded.  Perhaps he wasn't paying attention because he was too busy socializing with the gals up front so he couldn't be bothered to hear us out.

We will not be returning to this location as the service is awful, food is mediocre (at best), and management obviously does not care..."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, but Cheesecake Factory just seems to always be on point. No matter if it's this location or any other location across the country, Cheesecake Factory is just consistent and delicious. 

This place is pretty much a great restaurant that caters to all. You come here and always see large groups of families, especially little ones. If you come for lunch, this seems to be the spot for moms/wife's lunch dates with their friends. High school kids date nights. Or, for myself, just your casual Friday night date spot with the girlfriend.

There is always a line here and usually always a wait. However, it's so big and they have such a big staff and kitchen, the wait is never that long.

The food here seems to always hit the spot. They have something for every taste bud. Not the greatest, but they a pretty good job for every kind of dish for a place that doesn't specialize in one thing. The portions are huge.

Some of my favorites are:

Red Sangria
Chinese Chicken Salad
Salmon Kale Salad
Beet and Goat Cheese
Pear Goat cheese flatbread (substitute blue cheese for goat cheese - thank me later)
Chicken Nachos
Chicken Gyoza 
Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken
Orange Chicken
Spicy Cashew Chicken
Egg rolls 
And of course - the cheesecake

Just overall a great spot."}
{"text":"Way too noisy.  Nothing special about this place.  Prices are moderate to moderately high and I have yet to eat anything here that sticks out in my mind as being wonderful.  As mentioned, the noise level during peak hours becomes deafening for my liking.  I can't think of any reason to eat here again.  I've eaten here several times in the past 2-3 years, and each time I think it's going to be really good, but it's not.  The bread they serve with the salads and meals is so boring, and although it looks like it might taste good, it's a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriends. We were advised of the long wait. But we wanted to try it so we waited and hoped that will be worth waiting. Didnt disappoint! We all enjoyed the food we ordered and we all got slices of cakes for take out. The service is very good. Even though there is a very long line, once its your turn to eat the waiters are very relax, very welcoming and very patient.. that made our experience enjoyable, relax and fun."}
{"text":"my husband is a picky eater and he loved his meal, chicken and biscuits or something like that... although the server did not allow him to get a beer becaus he didn't have i.d. although he is clearly over 30, and the restaurant was pretty noisy based on the servers/bussers clanging dishes/silverware very loud while cleaning tables, but the food was pretty good and the service was prompt."}
{"text":"They need to improve their service. It took 20 mins to cook 2 dishes even the restaurant was only60%full. My husband found a piece of paper in his food, the manager offer to bring him a new dish but it took another 15 mins to get it. Server forgot everything, we have to repeat twice to get what we want from them. I always going back to cheesecake factory BUT not for this branch."}
{"text":"Der absolute Wahnsinn! Über die Cheesecakes brauche ich glaub ich nichts schreiben, sind die besten der Welt, sehr schöne Auswahl! Kosten ca. 5-8$ pro Stück, sind aber ordentlich von der Größe her.

Sonst haben die super Steaks (auch hanger Steak für 20$) die Qualität des Essens ist sehr gut. Die Salate kann ich auch wärmstens weiter empfehlen. Uns hat es hier sehr gut gefallen ist eins unser lieblings Restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I always love this place no matter what city I am in. I frequent Vegas as my in laws live there and having two kids under 3, it is difficult to dine out with them sometimes. I loved the speed in which our server, James, got our food out to us. He also understood to get our kids meals out faster so that a mutiny didn't erupt. Our meals came out hot and delicious and fast!

My only slight and very minor complaint was the kids meals came out PIPING HOT. I understand they were busy but it did mean we had food the kids couldnt eat for a minute or two but they were looking at it and couldnt understand why they couldnt eat it. Yes we know to blow on the food to help out but still the cheese sauce for the Mac n Cheese was lava hot. 

STILL will be going back!"}
{"text":"The clam chowder was very unhealthily salty. Chicken slider is good. Place lighting too dim. A lot of fusion style food. Good for couples and families."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location service and manager. Called prior to event and was told we don't take reservations. Opted to have the party there anyway due to convenient location. Bought two rounds of drinks at the bar and gave $5 tips both times. On the third trip to the bar, the bartender said don't come up to the bar again get a server to bring you drinks. What? This is Las Vegas and a bar. People walk up to the bar at every other place I've been all the time. Also, seating was available but we had to wait. Spoke to the manager and he was rude and didn't care. There were 25 people having food and drinks. You'd think they would be happy for the business. I will say most servers were nice, food was good, and we made the most of the seating issue and the bad attitude of that bartender and rude manager. But my future group events we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service has been awful tonight. Not only did it take an extremely long time to get our food in a non crowded restaurant they forgot my food and a friend's food. We had to tell the waiter that our food was missing and you cancel my order. Then the waiter informed the manager about the issues with our food and the manager was not professional nor did he apologize. Literally he walked up to our table says \"hoe does the food taste\" we reply good (because it did taste good, the appetizers we had gotten) then he walks away with not one other word. I will definitely be making an official complaint to their corporate. I can forgive the late food but for the manager to not even acknowledge the issues after the Waiter brought it to his attention he also did not even apologize for the issues. 

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! The manager on April 22, 2017 evening shift needs to be trained in how to provide good customer service."}
{"text":"I like this location, and find it to be an easy place to grab lunch if im  shopping at South Side Works during the mid afternoon on the weekend. I tend to come here at about 2 or 3pm on a weekend day. I won't waste my time by coming when it's crowded and waiting for an hour. At that point it's just not worth it.

I love the guacamole that they will prepare to taste, depending on how spicy you like it. I also enjoy the lunch salads, which are always huge. The only difference I have found between the lunch and dinner salads is the meat portion. Otherwise, they are exactly the same size.

As far as entrées go, I enjoy the Crusted Chicken Romano, the Pasta da Vinci, and the Miso and Herb Crusted Salmon. The Luau and Barbeque Chicken Salads are go to items for me as well.

To finish, if I'm not overly stuffed, I love the strawberry shortcake. It's loaded with strawberries and is perfect for sharing. I also really enjoy the Coconut Cream, Banana Cream, and Pina Colada cheesecakes. If you are a chocolate person, I would recommend the Godiva or Chocolate Mousse Cheesecakes.

As far as chains go, CF is a dependable choice. There is something for everyone, so it's great for a large group, especially when picky eaters are involved. I mean, who doesn't love cheesecake?"}
{"text":"Sheena was our server today and was really sweet!  She made our experience here such a wonderful one.  We will surely come back to this Cheesecake Factory when we are in town.  The chocolate turtle cheesecake was the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Yesenia is a great server! Very attentive and made sure everything went smoothly. One of the best servers we have ever had. Our drinks came fast as well as our food. Of course our cheesecake was delicious as well.  Thank you for the great night out!"}
{"text":"After Sushi Rock rudely turned us away. We headed to the Cheesecake Shack ... err... uhh Factory... hoping it was still open. Craving steak and drinks we needed somewhere asap as it was getting close to 11pm. The dreaded drop-dead kitchen hour when things close and restaurants become sparse.

Thankfully--there is always time to eat good in the neighborhood. Wait. Wrong slogan. Anywho. 

It was A-ok. We had Firecracker salmon rolls and mac and cheese to start. A nicely cooked Ribeye steak, bloody rare, with snow peas and carrots. Then finished it all up with an apple crisp. 

Decent. Saved us from being exceedingly hungry and pissed off at Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"Food poisoning last night!!!!! Skinnylicious steak medallions= DEATH. 

Oh my goodness, started barfing at 5 this morning and still ill!!!! I will never set foot in another Cheesecake Factory again."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is pretty, but if the restaurant was full you would hear every cup and plate clank together, could be very loud. Fortunately the day I was there the restaurant wasn't very busy. The menu is large but many of the dishes are some sort of chicken dish. We ordered the crab cake appetizer which was melt in your mouth great. My husband ordered one glass of lemonade $5.00-- really? We ordered fish and fries - the fish was a little dry, no ketchup was brought to the table and we had to flag down the waitress. We also ordered the chicken burrito, it was just OK. It needed more spices and the guacamole appeared as though it had been sitting out. The free bread was very good, the Key Lime cheesecake was also very good. We felt there are better restaurants in town for the price we paid. The waitress didn't bring us  change  when we paid the bill so we rolled the amount into her tip.  Will not eat lunch or dinner here again, but will return for cheesecake and coffee."}
{"text":"You could eat here everyday for a month & get something different every time. Something great, hearty, sweet, filling, easy or quick. This place has something for everyone. Love love love this place for family night!!!"}
{"text":"If you have had a long day  are tired of inconsistent service and food try ....   Awesome service ALWAYS. .. in the \"BAR AREA\" from...Clarke, Amie, Jason, Jeremy ! 
Thanks. ...Yummy"}
{"text":"Zero star. Terrible service! 
  I left my bag there after I finish my meal, when I back home I realize my bag is in the restaurant, and I go back immediately, but the waiter tell me there was nothing on my table.
  I go home again and still can not find my bag and I decide to call them back, but the lady who pick up the phone let me waiting on phone for 1 hour and then hang up my phone call. 
  I call them back again, they said they have my bag, and I drive all the way back again. 
 When the second time I go back, I ask for their manager, and I tell him I need to drive one hour to come here each time, and I spend two hours on driving and waiting on phone for one hour just for take my bag back.  And then the manager said: you house is far away from here is not our fault, and you wait on phone for one hour is system's fault, not us. And he keep saying we are big company, we not going to steal your bag. But all I want is a apologize ok? They treat me so mean, and I have the picture for that one hour phone call."}
{"text":"Best Cheescakes ever! They are totally worth the wait! There coffee is freshly brewed too! Every time I've been there the food has been excellent and the customer service superb!"}
{"text":"I always have a good time here.
Our service was amazing, she accomodated our requests for something gluten free, and went out of her way to talk to the chef.
The food is delish, the portions too big (don't eat all of it, you'll fatten up).
Great location at the Forum Shops.
I know in Vegas, I should have done a fancier foodie place, but needed food fast."}
{"text":"I found it rather bland. The service was excellant and the menu rather extensive, but just seemed like something was missing. I will give it another try, I could have just hit a off night."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years but it was just as good as I remember it, only a little more expensive.

We met some friends here for dinner. Parking on a Friday night is a challenge but they have valet if you don't want to circle around. When we checked in we were told it would be around 15 minutes but they had us seated in about 5.

Their menu is huge. Honestly, it's too big but there is something for everyone which is nice. We started with the crispy Cuban egg rolls and the stuffed garlic bread which were both excellent, the dipping sauce for the egg rolls was delicious! There was a variety of dishes from Alfredo, salads, steak Diane, another pasta dish and my orange chicken on the table and everything looked good. My orange chicken had great flavor and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The serving size was huge so I had the rest for lunch the next day. We were all stuffed but but you can't leave without trying the cheesecake. We tried the salted Carmel and a couple of milkshakes for our younger dining counterparts.

The service was excellent and our servers were very friendly and helpful. 

My dinner bill for 3 with an appetizer, sodas, 3 entrees, 1 piece of cheesecake and a milkshake was $93.00 before the tip.

The only downside of the dinner was the restrooms. Two of the three stalls had no toilet paper."}
{"text":"Treated 3 friends and we had great service, fantastic meals and a memorable time. We each ordered appetizers and entrees then shared a huge cheesecake four ways. My 3rd visit since discovering this place and will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I come in for happy hour often because they have great food and drink options for around $6 if you come between 4pm and 6pm."}
{"text":"I should preface this my saying I am not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory - I usually find the food unimpressive and pretty bland... and the wait for a table is just insane.  We were here on a Saturday at lunchtime and did not have to wait for a table - yay!  However, beware of the \"outdoor\" seating, which is a patio within the mall.  There is a show right there every hour that is incredibly loud and if you sit out there, you will not be able to carry on a conversation.  Sitting inside the restaurant is far better.  The waitress was very good and attentive and I actually really liked the appetizer (cheddar cheese dip with tortilla chips) but I was very very hungry.  However, the main dish was not so good.  I got the portobello mushroom sandwich with fries.  The fries were actually really good but the mushroom was so greasy that I could not eat it.  Maybe next time I will just stick with the appetizers."}
{"text":"We always shop at this outlet but this is our first time we ate at this location. Our waitress Valentina provided excellent customer service. We have been many Cheesecake Factory and this is the best service."}
{"text":"As loyal customer, I have always seek out Cheesecake Factory as I travel. This evening I ordered Jamaican black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp. It took an hour for food to come and when it came the chicken was burn badly. The manager, David, barely apologized and told me if \"I want anything to eat for dinner let him know\". It is 5:30 pm this is my dinner . I guess that was a nice way for him to say tough love but I will do anything for you."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is a safe bet for group settings. And you can't go wrong by ending the evening with cheesecake! 

This is one of my go-to's when I have a group. The menu offers anything and everything (which can also be a pain in the butt for indecisive people), the portions are HUGE and they offer healthy options with their Skinnylicious menu. My go-to is either the cobb salad or the caesar salad. 

And then good luck on only choosing one flavor of cheesecake. There is just about any flavor available. My favorites: Reese's Peanut Butter and Godiva Chocolate... mmm... Honorable mentions for Oreo and raspberry white chocolate. 

Service is not super speedy, so be careful if you're on a time limit."}
{"text":"We have eaten at many Cheesecake Factory locations. This has been by far the worst. We ordered a to go order, waited 45 minutes, got home to have no toppings on my salad, brown avocado in our egg rolls, brown guacamole in my husbands sand which side and zero toppings on our nachos."}
{"text":"We didn't have to wait long even on a busy Friday. The food was good and the service was great!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic experience. I have never been to any Cheesecake Factory that was crowded and got seated in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the chicken and biscuit dinner with a honey bourbon  and it was fantastic. My Bay ordered an omelet and it came out hot.  The food was great and service was outstanding."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS

So I get that everyone's excited about Cheesecake Factory coming to Canada. But the wait times at Yorkdale are absolutely bonkers!  Yes, there are often lines when you go to their U.S. locations. However, when I went a few weeks ago on a Tuesday night it took us over THREE HOURS OF WAITING to get a table. When my mother in law arrived at 4:30 & asked for a buzzer for a 6:30 reservation they wouldn't give one to her bc they said the wait time was only 75-90 mins. However, we ended up waiting twice as long!

THE FOOD- The menu is identical at every location. There is a huge variety and huge portions. My husband and I ate the leftovers of our salad for another 2.5 meals! The food is overall good but not great, as is the case in most chains.

THE DRINKS- We were disappointed when the Peach Bellini and other peach cocktail were both unavailable. I ordered a Pina Coloda instead which was quite good but my sister ordered a Pink Lemonade cocktail which tasted like cheap, sugary lemonade and little else.

THE SPACE- Cheesecake Factories all look the same but that doesn't bother me. What did annoy me is that we were told we had to wait so long because there are only 3 tables for 8 in the restaurant. This is a massive restaurant that caters to families! They should have more options for large groups.

THE SERVICE- When we finally got seated , our server was pleasant and apologetic and said that they would comp the birthday boy's meal."}
{"text":"Even tho the price is high but it worth every penny. Sometimes I just go there to buy cake. The only downside is the wait. Line is always long. Not just here and every Cheesecake Fac."}
{"text":"It was really exciting to hear that that a cheesecake factory was opening up here (even better if Kaley Cuoco was working here) but I think hype and the crazy demand was too much for it to live up to its american glory. For a table of two, we waited for about 45minutes and I did like how we got a beeper to let us know when it was time. But after we were seated, service was slow and the food was mediocre. There were many empty tables around, and i can kind of understand that if they didn't fill them on purpose because the kitchen can't keep up- but it's probably something the kitchen should be able to keep up with so it tells me that they still haven't gotten their operations to run smoothly. I might go back next year or if i happen to be in the area and there's no line to give it another try."}
{"text":"My family of 4 plus a uncle ate here for dinner before heading back to Denver.   

Around 3 pm. Seated fast. Staff friendly.   Food great as always.   My daughter ordered the bang bang shrimp and thought it was the best thing she has ever eaten at the CCF."}
{"text":"When you are in need of a slice of sweet sugary deliciousness, The Cheesecake Factory has got you covered. It's a staple \"nice restaurant\" sure to please even the pickiest of eaters...their menu is like a novel, granted half of it is full of advertisements. 

You can quickly turn to the lunch menu, page 8. The portions are plenty and will run you around $10, give or take. However, their regular beverages will run you a solid $4. A nice perk is that they serve their \"chocolate and vanilla\" bread (that's only how my friend's daughter describes it, not the flavor) anytime of day, whether you eat lunch or dinner. They do not have very many vegetarian options, but they do have a veggie burger filled with brown rice and beets. 

This location is prime...after a fun shopping spree at South Park, you can relish the day on their open patio! Service was attentive and friendly and the people working the host desk were all smiles. 

I don't go here often, but it's one of my mom's favorites and when nothing but cheesecake will suffice it is my go to place (a slice will cost you approximately $10). Like me and everyone else the day I was here, you'll leave full and happy with a \"to go\" bag in hand with a slice of deliciousness for later."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Went to celebrate my moms birthday here. I like how big the booths are perfect for large parties. Also we came at a great time, before the dinner rush. The service was great and the food was good. I tried the crab cakes which were great. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. Huge meatballs with great flavor and very moist. We had the lunch entrees which were huge. Enough for leftovers. Most commercial chain restaurants do not offer their lunch menus on the weekends .Cheesecake Factory you still got it."}
{"text":"This place is always awesome and the service from Chelsea was exceptional. We ordered a Thai lettuce wrap and a lemon chicken couscous which were both excellent. Cheesecake Factory has always been a go to for our family and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was top knotch."}
{"text":"We loved this place in the heart of the biltmore area.  Very charming wait staff who were very attentive and responsive to our needs.  Food quality was excellent and we had their legendary cheese cake to top an amazing dinner off."}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta FTW! 
It's mother/daughter date night and Hunnie Bunnie has picked this place again after having the Bow Tie Pasta in Marinara sauce last time. They should really take reservations because this place ALWAYS has a wait AND the waiting area gets CROWDED. 
The wait is 25-30 minutes. 28 minutes later our pager goes off - It's go time! 
Tonight Im starting with a glass of Prosecco. It's not as sweet as I would like so totally not ordering THIS again... I told our server I didn't like it and she was just kind of like Ooohkay... 
We start with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and their complimentary table bread served with little pats of cold butter. It would be better if the butter was actually spreadable but whatevez. The soup is in an ENORMOUS bowl and pretty tasty. We ate about half and had the rest packed up.
Chicken Chipotle Pasta for me it is! SO delish!! Perfect amount of spiciness that doesnt take away from the flavor of the dish - I love all the veggies mixed in with the pasta too along with the tortilla strips. I could probably just drink the sauce and be totally satisfied. Twice in the past I have tried a different pasta only to be disappointed so I'm just gonna stick with this WINNER! 
Hunnie Bunnie is getting her Bow Tie Pasta in Marina Sauce (meatless) and she obviously loves it - she says it is her FAVORITE!
So about mid-meal a very nice manager comes over and asks me about the Prosecco. I just told him it wasnt sweet enough to my liking and he took it away and OFF my bill :)
The Cheesecake is DELICIOUS of course as well! Rich and creamy and NOMTASTIC! Ask for no whip cream if you're not into it."}
{"text":"Hunnie Bunnie seems to be OBSESSED with the Bow tie pasta in marinara sauce here!! It's date night and she chose Cheesecake Factory. AGAIN. SHOCKER!! I decided to try the one in the Forum Shops since it is a little closer than going to Boca Park. 
We actually got seated pretty quickly here. Usually we wait a good thirty minutes at the Boca Park spot. We got a table for two outside of the restaurant so there was some really good people watching. 
This is RIGHT outside of the Caesar's show thing they do so it did get a little darker and noisier when the show was happening but it doesn't last TOO long. 
Camille had her usual, Bow tie pasta in marina and loved it. 
And I ordered my usual: Chicken Chipotle Pasta. I felt like it wasn't as spicy as when I usually get it and it was definitely saucier, watery if you will. It was still delish but I've had it on better days. 
I also ordered a Red Sangria and it was delish! 

We will definitely be back to this location though!"}
{"text":"Not disappointed by this location. 
The typical high quality service and food I would expect.
HATE the chairs!! 
You lean back and you slide off."}
{"text":"I'm a little bummbed, I ate there last night with my fiance. We usually go to the cheesecake factory in scottsdale but this one is closer to our home. This location was really cold, I understand it summer but the ac was blasting! Now I'm not giving this place a 2 star because of that, my food was just not good. I ordered the white chili chicken, it sounded good to me so I wanted to try it. The waitress came with our food (she was really nice and her service was great). My food came out cold and not very good. The chili was mush with a little bit of rice, some beans, and chicken. I would have asked the waitress if I could get my food reheated but I was starving so I ate it anyways. 
Not the best experience but we will stick to our normal location."}
{"text":"Hibatchi steak was delicious!!! I had the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake for dessert because how can you resist their cheesecake options. Very good!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! There's never a disappointment there! The service on the other hand, could use a little work! Very slow. The last time I came in was only for a slice of cheesecake and I was waiting for over 20 minutes! I don't think it takes that long to slice a piece of cheesecake now does it? I asked for a manager just to inform him of the situation and he was very apologetic and made sure I got a cheesecake (comped) to-go. That was nice considering I had waiting so long for it! For today's visit, a friend and I were waiting nearly 10-12 minutes just for the server to come and take our drink order! It's a little ridiculous but the food is so good I can't stop coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10pm on a Saturday night with a party of 9. Was told it would be an hour wait. The timing was totally off b/c they sat us in 15mins. We should've known then that it was too good to be true. My husband ordered a beverage, but never received it throughout the course of our meal. We ordered our dinner around 10:30pm and it took about 45mins to receive our food. We were told by the waiter that it takes a long time to cook a steak well. Really? First of all, you don't tell your customers an excuse like that. It doesn't take that long to cook a steak well either. Then when the food came out, my entree was cold. So that tells me that most of our food was already done but not brought out. Once we receive our food, we saw the waiter one time, then never again. We waited at least 15mins after we finished eating just to get the check. At this point my party is very irritated and just want to leave. We finally asked 2 other servers for a manager. One server stated that the managers were very busy. I told him that they shouldn't be too busy if a customer is requesting to see them. The manager comes out and asked if everything was ok? We all said no, not at all. As he walks over to me, i hear him mumble under his breath, \"everything hasn't been ok for me tonight either.\" Or something to that effect. When I asked him what did he say for clarification, he changed his words and said \"what's wrong?\" Like he really cared. Well after explaining to him about all of our problems and he could see that our table was full of dishes, meaning no one had been by to clear the table, offer dessert or coffee. He apologizes for everything, comps my meal but didn't offer anything else for the rest of my family that traveled out of town and are here for the first time. This was a very bad experience at cheesecake all together, including how the manager handled the situation. Highly disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We went to Dinner after shopping. I was excited hadn't had Cheesecake Factory in a long time. Wait time was nothing as it was late already around 8:30ish. We were seated just off the Bar kind of an add place for us since we had a  Child in our group, but ok. First here's the bad stuff. My glass looked like a 2 year old washed it. It was gross, not only was the glass cloudy you could feel the grit of old food on it. When we quietly pulled our waitress to the side to let her know. she said \" Oh I'll get you another one\" it was like this was expected or happens all the time. No apology at all. 2nd we ordered our food and waited about an hour for our meal. It was good could have been better could have been worse. The wait time for our dinner  was long and it wasn't very busy. Our waitress was less then attentive and we had to ask several times for a refill or for the Bud light my husband ordered. . The lady behind us was using a flashlight to show the waitress her steak was under cooked. Now for my favorite Part Cheesecake!!!  we ordered 5 slices to go as we were all tired and ready to go home. All of it was good as we all shared the next day. We may have actually stayed and ate in the restaurant if we didn't wait so long for our dinner. All and All it was decent. My Husband was disappointed that when he asked about onion rings he was shot down. But the food was good. Might try again might not just depends."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy business lunch meetings at the Cheescake Factory but yesterday had a lousy experience.   The location in Summerlin is typically very busy but they usually still manage to have good service.   Yesterday was an exception, and hopefully just a glitch.  After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to finally come tank drink orders.    She was obviously distracted and we realized later than Sen. John Ensign was sitting in the booth behind us and that was flustering her for some reason.   The food was ok - about what I typically expect from CF but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Food is great, but this place is reallyyyy popular, so you'll probably be waiting a bit to be seated. If you can, get a table in the courtyard so you can watch the show."}
{"text":"I really like the curry dish here. I think it is called Shrimp Chicken Bang Bang. Although iti s $18 it is a very large portion. The shrimp and chicken are seasoned before cooking. Plus, there is toasted coconut all over it. Very good.

My fiance got the chinese bun tacos. He said they were excellent. 

I also love the eggplant sandwich with snow peas and carrots for the side. 

I try to go here on an \"off-time\" because it can get very very busy."}
{"text":"With a massive menu and a large selection of cheesecake there really is something here for everyone. We went to dinner early to avoid the crowds which was a good thing because it is prom night and this is apparently the place the go for high school kids. The line waiting for a table was rather lengthy by the time we left.

We were seated right away and they were quick to bring out the bread and butter. My son ordered a sprite but was given a water but the server quickly corrected the mistake. Upon her suggestion we tried the cheeseburger egg rolls since they no longer have the Cuban egg rolls and she was right... they were tasty.  

I've always been a fan of the orange chicken but tonight it was clear my dinner was done first and sat while waiting for the other dishes because it arrived lukewarm. My husband had the white bean chicken chili and my son had the chicken Bellagio which was actually quite good. The piece of chicken in his meal was massive so he has leftovers for tomorrow.

Dinner for 3 was about $65.00 before the tip."}
{"text":"The one star is a bit unfortunate due to all the hype surrounding The Cheesecake Factory.  I wasn't irked because of the service or the long wait. In fact, the servers were friendly and attentive, providing guidance on the immense number of dishes. As for the lineup, I did wait for 1.5 hrs starting at 10:30 am during the Saturday of the Lunar New Year weekend, so I expected it. What actually resulted in the one star are the following:

- The prices are very high for food that tastes decent at best and are sometimes poorly plated

- I got the worst case of food poisoning in my life that evening. It makes sense because the restaurant had to close down for a day after the weekend I went; they apparently got a red card rating by the food inspectors. 

Because of the food poisoning induced by the dishes here, I can assure you I am too fearful to return."}
{"text":"Yum! Never been to a Cheesecake Factory and didn't like it. We had the kale quinoa salad super bomb, chicken carbonara amazing and the fish and chips. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasty."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at this Cheesecake Factory. Only thing was the seating this time, I felt the lighting was terrible, like I was in an interrogation room. Our waiter had great recommendations and was polite. The food was good and perfect for Friday date night. I had the herb crusted salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus. It also had a light cream sauce that was lemony that added an extra kick to the dish. I will l keep returning this location for great food and customer service."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory maybe 5 or 6 times now.  I love this place regardless that it's a chain because it's one of the higher quality bang for the buck type of restaurants.  This one's a bit different in that it's a standalone building in what seems to be the centerpiece of Southside Works with a mini water fountain type plaza in the front.

We came on a Sunday around 3:30pm this time around and there wasn't really a wait at all.  Originally we were just going to have dessert but I'm not really one for sweets so I ended up getting my favorite dish which is the hibachi steak.  

The Cheesecake Factory's menu is crazy and has a wide variety of things to choose from but as of late and for as often as we go I always seem to gravitate towards this same dish.  It looked a little different this time around as the steak although still sliced, wasn't scattered and was pretty much left as a whole.  The asparagus were smaller cut spears than previously which seemed to be about 2 or 3 whole spears tempura battered and fried.  The mashed potatoes seemed the same as before but with much more wasabi butter as usual which I did not mind at all.  The steak is sliced, with sprouts and mushrooms in a sugar and soy type of sauce.  Delicious!

Overall this is my favorite dish and while I've had many at many Cheesecake Factories all over the continent this is still my fall back menu item and I love it.  Everybody that has ever had a taste of my dish it pretty much became their favorite dish too OR they said it was amazing.  

The service at this particular Cheesecake and pretty much all for that matter is always great.  The floor here much like many I've been to before as well seems slippery, greasy or whatever.  I don't know what it is but if you have deck shoes here it could be dangerous!  

They pretty much all have the same decor and lighting, the foods basically all the same and so is the service.  Still as good as it gets for medium priced sit down chains and I'm looking forward to when they finally come up to Toronto in the near future.  

Wifi would be nice considering people come from all over to eat here and the place is large."}
{"text":"I've been here several times but I'm writing a review for the Sunday Brunch.  Yes, I like an occaisional diner or \"dive\" for breakfast after church but sometimes I like to have a nicely prepared breakfast in an visually attractive place where I can stay as long as I choose.  The Brunch menu isn't extensive but the food is freshly prepared and there are no lines to wait in because of the time of day-so it's relatively quiet.  It's nice not to have to hear the clinging and clanging of kitchen activity while eating.  Great for a sunday morning change of pace, an intimate conversation with friends or relatives or a short business meeting."}
{"text":"Ok now they start me with bread, which the crust was very hard to the bite on the other hand I ordered the chicken gumbo, which is my personal favorite and it was always to my liking."}
{"text":"Second time I tried The Cheesecake Factory and this particular location wasn't that bad. I thought it would be busy since it was at an Outlet. We waited for about 5mins before we were seated. The server was very nice and attentive, place was clean and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here probably 5 times in the last 3 months. I can honestly say that out of every single experience we have had great service and the best food in Las Vegas. The menu is so diverse and anyone can find something to love here. I really think this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Service never disappoints and once when I made a mistake on my order the waitress had my entree remade to my liking and didn't even bat an eye. Priceless! I will gladly bring friends and family to the Cheesecake Factory anytime!! Can't wait to go back. BTW my favorite dinner is the Spicy Chicken Chiptole pasta!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Always great food and good service
Waiters are all very well trained and food is always up to top standards so you know what to expect
Prices are reasonable and that damn cheesecake at the end is fantastic"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Cheesecake Factory as I had a gift card to use. First of all the decor and ambiance are very appealing. I was expecting it to look like it does on The Big Bang Theory. It is much nicer and more upscale. There was a bar area that looked comfortable and inviting. We were seated promptly.

Our waiter was Brian and he was fantastic! He was triple seated in his section and was attentive to all of his tables. He didn't miss a beat and took care of everyone in a timely manner. Super friendly and professional!

I ordered a Long Island Ice Tea and it was PERFECT! The menu is extensive ...15 pages or so. There is something for every taste palate! For dinner, I ordered the pork chops and it came with homemade apple sauce.  The food was delicious! I would definitely go back again sometime. The only downside for me is that it's in Crocker Park and I am not a fan. But for those of you that are, I recommend stopping in The Cheesecake Factory for a drink or dinner after you're done with your shopping!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake Factory is a restaurant known for their variety of delicious cheesecake and their delightful meals. I have been to the cheesecake factory several times and in different states and cities and every time I have gone I have ordered something different. However, I have always been satisfied and delighted with my dinner. Nevertheless, to say that the servers are very gentile and attentive with their customers. The complimentary bread they serve is amazing I can literally say that I can stuff myself with bread and be a happy camper. I would totally make them a five star restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant's for happy hour or any other event lol. I decided to try the salmon mashed potatoes and broccoli which was Delicious! I then finished my dinner off with the dutch apple cheesecake, smh, Amazing! The chunks of apple with the crumble mixed in is sooo good. I usually switch my cheesecakes each time but I  may be stuck on this one for a while."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat \"except\" they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service. On occasion when my wife and I stop on for lunch, there always manages to be some issue with the food in one another's meal. Given there are 2 of us? That translates to them hitting the mark 50% of the time. The menu selection is awesome. The dark molasses indian bread with butter is worth the trip and if you can get a great service, try the appetiser salad of pecan, endive and blue cheese. The take out cheese cake cant be beat."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We had a party of 20. 5 of us 2 adults and 3 kids arrived first. As soon as we sat down we told the waiter we wanted to order but asked for a kids menu. An hour later everyone was seated and had drinks that were empty. I grabbed a waiter and told him we were ready to order and that we wanted our own checks. He said he would split it later. Never got the the kids menus, ordered only appetizers and another hour later I asked another waiter to check on our food. Found out it was ready but they were holding until the entire table was ready. Took 20 minutes for our check that I asked for when I got my food, which i had to go and get it! Asked for a manager and she was so rude. Never apologized about us being there for 3 hrs with 3 kids and forgotten about. I've never been to a place that was so disorganized. My salad had no dressing and my appetizer was served without the dipping sauce asked for both which never came. Needless to say I will never be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant and try to eat there every time I am in Las Vegas. They have a menu full of variety and options and very unique combinations of food. My server was excellent and the food was delicious I have no complaints"}
{"text":"OK, I really feel that this place rocks...chain or no chain, CF is in another league when it comes to chain restaurants.  I have yet to have a bad experience (or even anything mediocre) at any of the locations.  The overall quality, selection, atmosphere and service are always top notch.  I generally only eat lunch here, dinner on occasion and even at the peak of the lunch hour, I have never experienced slow or lacking service.

Today we were really hungry, so we started with Buffalo Blasts for an appetizer, these are amazing (see pics).  They taste like a fabulous combination of fried chicken and hot wings, served with hot sauce, blue cheese (the real deal) and celery sticks.  We both ordered salads, the BBQ Ranch Chicken (topped with onion rIngs) and the Chinese Chicken salad which has always been delicious.  We finished off the meal with a slice of Vanilla Bean cheesecake which is lighter than some of the other kinds, and absolutely delicious.  I could enjoy a big bowl of the whip cream by itself!

Overall, I really enjoy this place and always look forward to treating myself to lunch here.  And it doesn't hurt that it's in the mall....lunch AND shopping is never a bad thing :)"}
{"text":"The food tasted so good. Fresh hot bread was  delightful. The server was nice, the place was SO CROWDED, and loud, we got seated quickly, and the Tropical Ice Tea is heavenly!!  Employees were hopping, and very considerate and helpful."}
{"text":"First time here, was excited...then to sit down at the bar with a bartender who doesn't care sucks. Bad customer service.  I work in the industry and people like her are the reason I hesitate to go out to eat. Whether the food and drink are good or not is irrelavent if I have bad service"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on 12/27/14.  Called from Planet Hollywood prior to ask how long the wait for 2 people would be, we were told currently it was an hour with no reservations available to make or give a name.  We made the trip over there, speak to the host and ask to put our name down for 2 people.  He gives us a look and a groan, so my response was \"what, the wait is now up to 2 hours?\"  His reply was \"Actually it's odd, I can seat you immediately right now.\"  WHAT!  Score!  We were seated in literally 4 minutes.  This must have been a rare case, because we ended up being seated still in close proximity to the host platform and all the rest of parties of 2 coming in after us were all being told an hour wait and to take their name down.  I guess we were just lucky.
All of the food was amazing, we had burgers and mac and cheese balls.  So good.  We ended up taking a few slices of cheesecake to go because he had a fridge in our hotel room.  The lemon meringue one was awesome!
We had a great experience!"}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL, warm sunny day! We are here for the 4pm-6pm 'Happy Hour' but they won't let u sit on their patio during 'Happy Hour'... Bummer! Great food, wish we could enjoy it in the sunshine."}
{"text":"This place has a great variety in their menu. A bit too much I think, the service was average our waiter was a bit forgetful. The food was good overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"You know, I get it--the cheesecake here is really really good.  But everything about this place is really really bad.  

First, I cannot get over the fact that this place tries to pass itself off as fancy (valet parking, for example) when it is a) called \"The Cheesecake Factory\" and b) ATTACHED TO A MALL--arguably two of the least fancy things imaginable.  

The inside of this place is basically a glorified cafeteria--just a loud din of noise, which makes it even crazier that people dress up to go here. The food itself (even that which is not cheesecake related) is incredibly caloric and fattening.  I spent most of my life trying to avoid this place, and, I realized today, for good reason--this place is just thoughtless excess at its finest."}
{"text":"Can I complain about the 15+ pages of menu?  Well, I'm going to.  I'm a vegetarian, and picky at that, but the menu confuses and overwhelms me!  Thank goodness this wasn't my first time. 

In addition, I can't help but wonder....if a restaurant offers so many items can all the ingredients be fresh and can they do each dish at a high quality?  Although I wanted to try the grande burrito, I wasn't going to risk it.  

I stuck with what I know, and that's a greek salad and the white bean hummus.  It was really good and tasted fresh, I'll give 'em that!  

Service was pretty good for it being so busy.  The fiance didn't seemed too thrilled with his meal and no one else was raving about anything other than the mashed potatoes.   Oh well.  Definitely an A-OK place."}
{"text":"As with any Cheesecake Factory location, the variety on their menu is a huge draw. We find that the menu typically has something to offer for everyone! (Two of my personal favorite items are the beet salad and the grilled fish tacos) As some previous reviews suggested, the service here is definitely lacking... Not only are the wait times usually long- especially for a group- but once you are actually seated it does take a while for you to order and ultimately get your food."}
{"text":"Fun fact: Cheesecake Factory hates handicapped and disabled people. True story.

Disrespectful and rude.

Don't normally post negative reviews, but this was ridiculous. I just had disc surgery in my neck, which means traveling to Cheesecake Factory is out of the question.

My sweet cousin offered to go pick up cheesecake as a pick-me-up, so I called, ordered, and told them I wouldn't be able to pick it up myself. The young lady at Cheesecake Factory said that it was fine and she gave me the discount and price at 12$ over the phone; being grateful, I thanked her.

When my cousin arrived, she was told to go wait, which she did, the bagged cheesecake just sat on the counter as other people came in and placed orders. As she asked again to pick up the order, the young lady (maybe a different person) asked where the other people were for the discount, and she told her I called in and was the one who had the surgery.

The manager comes over and removes the discount without consideration of circumstances. Clearly loyalty to your restaurant doesn't matter. Clearly your employees words don't mean anything. It was literally not something that needed issue, yet the manager felt being a jerk about a policy, I know for a fact they've made plenty of exception before, was necessary tonight.

Wrong.

This place has great food, garbage management. Chandler from now on..."}
{"text":"Being a fan of the TCF, but not being able to get into the one in metro Detroit, this was a great option.

Thankful that they took call ahead seating as we called 90 minutes in advance, Nicole was gifted in hospitality.

We arrived at 4:28 , all metered parking .25 per 15  3 hour maximum .

The hostess kiosk was empty, no one not one person staffing it, we were part of 2 couples waiting to be *noticed *recognized*seated
( as 5 servers gathered behind the cheesecake display case  )

Finally a manager from the back of the house saw our dilemma, jumped in and sat both parties.


Steven was our veteran 11 year server, knew the menu back & forth and was a bigger than life persona . ( when we could track him down as he was a.w.o.l. several times )

Don't get me wrong , very good server, smart & friendly, and got more than 20% , but less time gabbing at every order station with your coworkers would be wise.

Now beyond the bumps in the road, our food was 5 stars , and the portions were huge, which provided leftovers and 2nd meals for us both .

My wife ordered the:
 Crispy Chicken Costoletta
Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded and Sautéed to a Crisp Golden Brown. 
Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Asparagus.
$17   three large chicken breasts lightly breaded and moist through & through.

I ordered:
Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp
Sautéed Shrimp with a Very Spicy Jamaican Black Pepper Sauce. Served with Rice, Black Beans, Plantains and Cool Mango Salsa. Available with Chicken or Chicken and Shrimp.

I ordered it with both chicken and shrimp, plus they allowed me to swap out white rice for brown.

Both dishes were 5 star in flavor, taste & portion size

Boxed 50% of our meals for today's lunch and ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake for home
triple vanilla bean
&
salted caramel

food  5 stars
seating -staffing -getting the ball going  2 stars"}
{"text":"Food was great. Seats were so close together that I felt like I had to make friends with the people sitting next to me.

My wife felt like the waiter was hitting on her while I was parking the car. We were seated next to the waiter station and was uncomfortable with the amount of testosterone that was being expelled. The guys were talking about this, along with the chest bumps. The waiter was clearly unhappy when I showed up and seemed uncomfortable while serving us. Very in-personable."}
{"text":"EDIT: I am lowering the score from 2* to 1* because while it's forgivable that the FOH staff spilled something on me and my party's clothing, it isn't okay that they simply don't bother to fix that problem going forward. The manager gave us two business cards after being splashed with buffalo sauce and said that if we mailed the receipts for dry cleaning with those cards it would be reimbursed. We sent in two receipts (my fiance and I) with bills totaling $22 but after 2 months have received nothing back. I have worked as a waiter for years and I get these things happen but it is incumbent on the management staff to resolve these issues and I think the poor job they did trying to fix the situation is indefensible. 

Meh!

This place is just silly and expensive for the quality. 

Quick thing about the restaurant: Why make waiters wear all white? EVERY server's uniform has visible stains. I have waited tables for years so I get how this happens all the time when you are bussing plates so have the waiters wear darker colors (or enforce uniform standards, there is no way all the waiters came in with clean clothes given the universal level of dirtiness). Also, a waiter dropped a thing of buffalo sauce on the floor near us which exploded on both me and one of the people I was with's white shirts, the restaurant offered to pay for dry cleaning, but I kinda think that there should be a comped desert or something as well. The dry cleaning (if effective) is an inconvenience for me which gets me back to where I was before I came in, I think that offering a dessert is something to make up for the inconvenience of making me and my dinner guest have to go to get our clothes dry cleaned. Perhaps I expect too much.

About the actual food: it's just not anything worth paying the price for. I had Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, it was labelled as spicy and I asked for it to be extra spicy, there was no spice at all. 

My fiance had orange chicken. It was plain and less than one would expect from a basic chinese take-away.

The other person we were with ordered meatloaf, it was actually ok but the mashed potatoes were cool by the time it was run to our table.

I honestly think that the restaurant just has too many things on that menu to get all of the items right.

Positives: the iced tea was good (this matters a lot to me) as were the mojitos the ladies ordered. Two of our deserts were great (I guess this is really why people go here), the tiramisu cheesecake was still thawing when it was brought to us so it was a bit hard in the middle."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner. We were greeted and seated within a few minutes by a nice hostess. Within a few minutes  our waiter acknowledged us as he delivered drinks to another table. I really like that. A few minutes went by and another waiter came to our table and asked if we had been helped yet. Thats great team work!!  Our waiter was attentive and aimed to please. 
We got free bread and butter to start. 
We both had the shrimp platter with fries and cole slaw. My friend subed a salad for the fries with no up charge, nice!  The portions were large. The slaw was some of the best ive had, fresh and sweet tart. Many large shrimp pipping hot. We didnt wait long for our food. 
I looked around at other customers food and the portions were huge. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Great as usual. Gave suggestions of things to try. Boxed up the dinner and the food was great. Just a bit slow on coming around to the table but that's what you'll get on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Probably not going there again.

Prices are high but the food is hit or miss and there is always a wait. 

The veggie burger I got was probably one of the best I've had and considering I'm a vegetarian - that is a high priority. The appetizer with the deep fried vegetable variety was quite good! I never thought deep fried avocado could be so good.

Unfortunately the next time I visited, they happened to not have Veggie burgers. On the fly I picked an Omelette and was fairly bored despite it having usual goto ingredients. Honestly, missing such a severe ingredient was a real let down considering the wait to get in and seated."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory, I've come to three different locations thinking maybe it's just the location but so far I'm unimpressed with the food and staff, it's always a long wait to be seated. Once you're seated they ask about drinks then 15 minutes later they arrive and again with the wait but longer for your food. Each time I've eaten food here I've been sick the rest of the evening. But I will say their deserts are amazing I'm now only coming for desert pick up because it's so delicious!"}
{"text":"I was just hungry. I ordered the Cajun chicken lil bits. They were not little and the portion size was unbelievable. I can put away some good and there was plenty left for a good lunch. 

Gotta love the portion sizes! Bartender was cool as well"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love Cheesecake Factory... but I am sosososo disappointed with their new menu changes... the lemon chicken with carrots and broccoli was absolutely to die for the last time we went and then today we find out they changed the menu. Instead of extremely lemony, the dish was just buttery and oily with barely any taste of lemon at all... not a happy camper :("}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place.  Two stars is generous.

First of all we ordered a large ($300+) take-out order for a client online.  We went in 45m early to dine in on something small beforehand and when we inquired about the take-out order it took them 25m to find it so then it wasn't ready on-time.  I wonder how late it would have been if we hadn't gone in early.

Second, the cleanliness of the restaurant was C+ at best.  We were there when they opened and our table had a few small random pieces of food on it.  The silverware also had water spots and scum on them.  The floor under the table next to us had a big brown smear under it that I hope was chocolate.

Third the food was very salty and they hit a big pet peeve of mine which is pepper shakers where the pepper comes out at a trickle.

Fourth, and this is just a matter of taste, the music is all the whiney pitchy stuff that only appeals to a small percentage of the population.

Anyway the only save here was the attitude of the hostesses and waitstaff who were very nice."}

{"text":"I'm going give this one a 3 star . Hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in years . ( I just feel like their menu is all over the place ) has EVERYTHING! but I alway tend to order out of their specialty section . As we arrived took us a while to get even drinks started , once the waitress got there we order a appetizer , we waited and waited . By this time , we had a new server (because our initial Waitress was going home for the day) our new waitress was a great one btw out appetizer was never brought to us !!! The 1st waitress ever put it in !!! No biggy it's a Sunday , it's around 4pm & it's busy and (we are all human ). Other then that our food was delicious as always and we got cheesecakes to go and enjoyed them at in the Confort of our home!  Not to mention the 2nd waitress was a great one !"}
{"text":"Had the miso salmon and love it and husband had the fish and chips and it was delish!!! Our server Ashley was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this Cheesecake Factory restaurant tonight and had a really good time. Our waiter was pretty attentive to us and always was checking on us. I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. Let me just say this thing was amazing. The flavors were outstanding. I then had the Spicy Chipolte chicken pasta. Cannot believe how great that was. I have been several times before and I always have the same dish. With the great food, and the good service I can only say I wish I was going back tomorrow. By far and away my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant -- can you believe it??  Met a friend for lunch here.  I was impressed with this location's ambience and spaciousness.  I was also impressed in that they had my scotch  --  18 year old MaCallan single malt!!

Service was good and attentive, and they did not chase us out early to turnover our table.

I ordered the Americana Cheeseburger, fries, and garden salad.  Everything was good -- nothing outstanding, but good.  I had to eat the burger with a knife and fork.  It was one of those small circumference buns and patties, but thick and big.  So it would have been difficult to put it into my mouth, even my big mouth.

One small negative -- prices are high here.  Maybe because of the property's operating costs.  My friend's salad was $12 and my burger was $12 and the side of salad was an additional $3.  Drinks (iced tea) were extra too.  So my lunch was close to $20 -- that is high for lunch.  There are so many places where I can get a big, nice lunch with a drink for under ten bucks."}
{"text":"Went here with my beautiful and perfect girlfriend who is absolutely just a blessing in my life and ordered her whatever her heart desired for lunch. Portions were huge, waiter was awesome, we were full, and cheesecake was delicious even after being snuck into the movie theatres. I gave this place a 4 because it was like 60 bucks for lunch.."}
{"text":"I come here twice a year...mother's day and mom's birthday...I feel like there's a pattern here.

With one of the largest menu's around you'd think you could please everyone?...well maybe if everything they made was great....instead I am let-down more than I am delighted.  Most of their items aren't bad, but seldom does anything stand out to me.  I pity the servers here, and the corporate demands they seem to have to deal with...if it is obvious to the customer then it isn't working.

My go-to classic is the Chicken Madeira.  It is one of the better chicken dishes from a chain-restaurant.  I'm not really into desserts, but I can share the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake any time I'm here!

Needless to say I love my mom, and am more excited to see her than I am to come to The Cheesecake Factory...and being that we have a large family, The Cheesecake Factory isn't really all that bad of a choice...we cold do a lot worse!"}
{"text":"I can't review the food here because we never got seated! Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much. 

We called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave. 

I have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could. Had the hostess we'd spoken to earlier in the day not said it wouldn't be a problem, we would have made other arrangements for dinner that night."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner last night with my boyfriend and our waiter was awesome. The portion sizes are ginormous, so I took my leftovers home. I was looking forward to eating my pasta today, and noticed it WAS NOT my food! IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE'S LEFTOVERS! EW. So grossed out and super upset I wasn't able to enjoy the rest of my pasta."}
{"text":"**Warning** Do not order the cooked food here except for burgers and pizzas. It is not edible!! I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, a shrimp scampi and their potato soup. Words cannot describe how awful they all were.... I sent back both of these entrees in exchange for a turkey sandwich  for lunch. I gave them two chances but I had to send back my food twice.

The Cheesecake factory in Riverside, NJ is waaaaaay better!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE!!!!
Waited 20 minutes to even get service at the bar, had to ask 4 times and finally for a manager for olives, waited another 1/2 hour for appetizers that came out barely warm and to top it off the busboy kicked my wheelchair in passing, looked back and said \"That's ok, I'm fine\"- NO apology, no \"excuse me\"......
Told the manager and he dismissed the busboys boorish behavior, argued the cold appetizers and took NOTHING off the bill for such poor service!
We left after appetizers and went to the steakhouse for dinner!!!
NEVER AGAIN will they see us!"}

{"text":"The Chicken Parm Sandwich, is amazing.  Always fresh and hot.  Its a simple sandwich in general.  This place has nailed it.  As far as I'm concerned.  I've visited different locations with this order.  Not sure if it's because they are dairly new, at the time of this post?  However, it was spot on!  Was so full, didnt even order dessert....."}
{"text":"Great location, sucky parking.  Being so close to the mall you have to drive around and find something. 

The food was what I have come to expect. They were able to accommodate our party of 10 in a matter of minutes (lunch made that easier, I think).  The staff was attentive and the price was right."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. I have eaten at some top flight restaurants in Napa Valley, Sonoma, Las Vegas And right here in my home town Cleveland where I have had the privilege of eating at Iron Chef Michael Symons establishment, and Rocco Whalen establishment. The Food was amazing at those restaurants. People may think I am crazy but, the meal my family had at Cheesecake Factory was very very good. What made this experience was the waiter we had! His name was Omega. I do not think we had to ask for one thing throughout the entire meal! Constantly filled out our drinks, the meal was brought out at the same time still hot. They say the better the service you get the better the meal is.....well if that is the case Our waiter Omega made this meal taste like we were eating at a 5 star restaurant. Way to go Omega, you made our entire night!"}
{"text":"I normally LOVE the Cheesecake Factory, but dang... 

Today I ordered a dish with chicken and added an order for Sausage on the side and when I came in to pick it up (To Go), I was told that they'd put it into the dish itself.  Normally, I'd not worry since my plan was to add it anyway, but when I got home, I discovered it wasn't even in the dish!  

Also, I nearly left before deciding to check to ensure the cheesecake was in the bag, and I saw they'd forgotten that, too!  I wish I'd have checked for the sausage...  

Can't make the trip back - no time today.  For the $ I dropped there, I should at least get what I ordered! 

Called back and was put on hold.  Waited so long that I could have driven back myself to pick it up! 

I come here so rarely, and when I do, I'm looking for some quality for the higher price.

Super disappointed.

*Update:  I actually ate the dish and decided to add a star because it was pretty tasty. 

...just not what I'd ordered..."}

{"text":"Went with my mom for her birthday (didn't tell the staff lol).  Ordered:

1) Hibiki steak: found this really tasty and think it suits Asian tastes.  Albeit it's on the sweeter side.

2) Mac and cheese burger: the patty was good quality and the bun was toasted nicely.  The Mac and cheese topper was just soso though, nothing special.  It's just a normal burger imo - burgers from Hero Burgers etc equally good.

3) Standard cheesecake with strawberries: this is okay, slightly on the sweet side for my tastes.

Will definitely be back to try more steak options and the lemon meringue cheesecake looked good.  OH! The complementary bread was delicious!"}
{"text":"Generally speaking I'm not a chain restaurant fan. This place is decent though. We came tonight for my moms birthday and I get the appeal for her. She's a midwestern bland food kind of person. Nothing wrong with that, but I am the exact opposite so I only find it \"ehhh\". The menu is insanely large and overwhelming. Seriously, I've never seen a restaurant have so many options and I'm not sure that's a good thing either. The prices are also very high, however one entree is enough food for two people so it evens out... Seriously the portions are ENORMOUS. I finally decided on the Parmesan crusted chicken and it came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The chicken tasted good but the Parmesan crust was soggy. The green beans were bland and underdone but the mashed were very good. It did take forever to get our food. This is definitely not the place to go if you're in a hurry. I love their pineapple upside down cheesecake however it's seasonal and not available... I haven't had it in years so it may not even be a thing anymore. I opted for the original; not bad but obviously comes in frozen and then thawed for sale. My mom got the key lime cheesecake and I wasn't a fan. I prefer New York style cheesecake and this was really thin. However if you prefer the thinner version you will love it and huge bonus point the whipped cream is homemade and not from a can!! Overall it's an a-okay place for a meal. It absolutely knows it's audience and appeals to them successfully. I get the success, just not a place I will be a regular at."}

{"text":"I love the chicken costoletta. The sautéed chicken and lemon sauce is perfect! Their chicken and biscuits is my other go-to. Enough for two meals. Their multigrain wheat goes great with either. The only issue I have with the restaurant and the reason they lose a star, in my opinion, is their seating. I can't stand how close they seat you to other patrons. You're essentially eating with strangers. I know they want to maximize available tables, but I do not want to have a date or private dinner with another party like 24 inches away. Especially if weak bladders are involved by your \"neighbors\". The obligatory crotch or butt in your face as they try to squeeze pass is not always appreciated when you're trying to enjoy your meal."}

This CF is well outside of the strip area of Las Vegas and is frequented by the locals from the Green Valley area.  We came here early on a Sat. afternoon (4-ish) and the place wasn't crowded at all.

Service was a tad bit slow at first but with a little prodding (and departures by other tables) our waitress picked up the pace.

For a party of 8 we were all pleased with our staple dishes ranging from Mexican to Asian to American fare."}
{"text":"This place was busy for lunch but we were both hungry and neither of us knew what we wanted, so we came here.  As always, the menu is huge.  Service was fantastic and quick.  It wasn't very loud, and you can't hear anything from the Fall of Atlantis show that's just outside.  Both of our food dishes were very yummy and my Mai Tai was made superbly.

While he started out acceptable, he left us sitting for 20 minutes after he took our credit cards. We could see him tending to other tables, but he never came back. We finally gathered up our leftover and went to the front desk to get their assistance in retrieving our credit cards and receipts. This server experience will not keep me from returning to this restaurant because the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Three words: I am happy. 

The Cheesecake Factory I had in the states is completely similar to what they offered here. For appetizers, we started off with the mac & cheese balls, the mexican tacos and the calamari. Everything tasted great! I was so thrilled to order my tuna salad and it tasted amazing. I also had the Oreo cheesecake, which was divine. I am definetly going here again and probably ordering the same thing I had last time."}
{"text":"I love this place and today we went in for brunch first they took for ever to bring out to plates the place was empty when the food was ready and got my meal my food was cold ! They took it back to make a new one took for ever i dint even want my food any more at this point  i finished my husbands food to top it off he order of the lunch menu and they charged him full price we dint say anything because it was just a horrible experience ! Very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Really? Why do restaurants like this even exist, other than because of Americans' abysmal taste in food (which is based on the fact that Americans are subjected to crap like this every day and just don't know any better)?"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is one of our very  favorite restaurants.  The closest one to our town is 4 hours away. When we travel we always search Yelp for one to stop and eat! Love starting off with their delicious crusty bread.  I enjoy their enchilada with corn cakes and black beans.  My husband always gets burrito grande!  The food presentation is beautiful and the food delicious.  Portions are very generous.  There is hardly ever room for the delicious dessert they are known for.  If that is the case,  I get it to go."}
{"text":"There hasn't been a CF restaurant that I've met that I didn't like until this one. I'm a lover of this restaurant chain. Love the steak Diane. I've gone there three times not wanting to not like them. Located in the Outlet Mall near downtown Las Vegas the newest CF in Las Vegas. Everything I tried this last time was too little or too much. The beet and goat cheese salad. Beets were over cooked and smushy. I've never had smushy beets. They were also too salty. Too few pieces of pecans and goat cheese. The dressing had too much vinegar and too little oil. I ordered the steak medallion instead of the steak Diane off the skinnylicious menu. The serving was too small and again too too much salt. I was done after two bites. I tried my daughters buffalo chicken appetizer. Again too salty. She had a side of the buffalo sauce. Guess what too salty. My strawberry lemonade that I always get several refills was too sweet. I don't know what's going on with this location but I am not in too much a rush to go back. I hope they get it together because I love the chain and it is usually a good choice when I travel.  

UPDATE!
I recently tried this location again. The dishes I ordered taste like what I expect from all CF. 5th time was the charm."}
{"text":"The wait for a table is ridiculous. We waited two hours on a Wednesday evening to be seated and our server told us it was more like a 4-6 hour wait on the weekend. After that kind of wait, you'd think the food and service would knock our socks off but both were merely okay. The service was rather slow actually. I would chalk that up to how busy it was but we had more than two servers covering our table and yet at one point we sat with empty glasses for 20 minutes and no one stopped by to ask if we'd like another drink or how we were doing. From the time we put our name on the list for a table to the time we paid our bill was 4 hours. Save your time and your money. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. We went 10:30. First to get buzzed. Right at 11 they opened. 

We ordered the califlower Korean sauce and it was super good. 

We got cchicken parm style pizza
Lunch bbq ranch salad 

And banana cheese cake
And salted caramel cheese cake ( which was not good) 

Overall we spent $73 and it was good."}
{"text":"As always, the food and service was nothing short of amazing. Our server even sang our son happy birthday and decorated his cheesecake plate so nicely as well as even a candle in his cheesecake. We live an hour away but always make the trip as much as we can"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, amazing food, and amazing staff, got seated immediately with my reservation. Me and my family enjoyed dinner, it was very luxurious. The staff gave us hot towels to wash our hands and the food tasted so good! Definitely a favorite for us!"}
{"text":"I had rachael as my server and went here for dinner tonight and I order the Rennes Special, it was nothing like I expected had one bite and the server didn't even offer to take it off my bill or anything instead after I told her I didn't like it. I was very disappointed with my visit and my previous times being here With having very slow service...."}
{"text":"No reviews?  Oh, my.  Well it is a chain, but it's a good chain.  It has saved our taste buds more than once from the likes of Chili's and Applebee's.  We love to eat here for a late lunch, when there isn't the hundreds of people waiting in line.  I could eat most any of the appetizers (except the fried macaroni -- too weird), but love the corn cakes.  I'm a Chicken Romano kind of girl and my husband varies from the Steak Diane to the Shepard's Pie to lots of other things.  I am so glad that they now have \"lunch\" portions.  They are still too big for me to finish, but at least I'm not leaving an entire cow on my plate.  

We always wonder why they can have such a huge menu and still make most dishes taste terrific when other restaurants can barely make one thing well.  The only thing we avoid is the cheesecake.  I've never liked cheesecake and my husband can take it or leave it.  And after their huge portions, he generally leaves it.

Oh, and did I mention the bar?  Great drinks.  I LOVE the smoothies.  The decor is interesting in a Vegas kind of way.  We come here a lot!"}
{"text":"The food is almost always very good, never had a problem with cleanliness.  The service is not good at all. We live here and have only been to this location a handful of times hoping it will get better.  It doesn't.  I think we will stick to this place when we go out of town only.  Its so disappointing because we always said it would be great to have one close to us.  We always wait much longer than told.  Once we waited 45 minutes for a carry-out order past our pick up time. The last couple of times we waited for a long time to get our food once we ordered.  It's usually a 1.5 hour process once we are seated.  This time we went for lunch and the server brought out the wrong meal and actually argued me that it was what I ordered.  Even though everyone else in the party also disagreed with her.  Unfortunately, I ate the meal and still had to paid for it.  No offer to make it right."}
{"text":"Just went for takeout dessert: originally came in for an early dinner at 4pm on a Friday but was told the wait was two hours so I went in the mall for dinner and came back for dessert. The lineup for that wasn't bad, we waited approx. 15 min from getting in line to receiving our cake. The cake was delicious and tasted the same as the locations in the US. 

If you're planning on going for dinner, expect to wait a long time until things cool down in a few months. (Written Jan. 2018)"}
{"text":"Tried their Miso Marinated Salmon, such a tasty and beautiful dish. I loved the white sauce that gives it a sweet taste. Comes with brown or white rice and snow peas. Portion was great too I was able to take leftovers. I recommend this dish if you're in the mood for some seafood. Our server was great, made sure our drinks were refilled and was very attentive. I like the dim lighting and atmosphere is quite romantic. This place gets pretty pact and although they don't take reservations until after 8pm I would call ahead and ask what the wait time is. We were able to get seated right away on a Wednesday night though. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and holy moly were we pleasantly surprised. I had the pasta napoletano and I absolutely destroyed it. Creamy, buttery and full of flavor; I will absolutely have this again. Of course you can't leave without a slice of their heavenly cheesecake. I chose the dulce de leche. No regrets. Reasonable price. Everyone should eat here."}
{"text":"2 stars for the overall experience. The wait times are unreasonably long. The food is generally pretty good, depending on what you get. The menu is HUGE, so there is something for everyone here. But, this place is always crowded (lunch, brunch, dinner...always!) The hostess said the wait would be 10 mins, and we ended up waiting 30mins - we arrived at 5pm on a Thursday. However, the table service is consistently excellent. Their salads are huge and usually great. I would recommend patronizing another restaurant - there are plenty of places with just as good service and food, and no wait times at all."}
{"text":"I went the other night with my husband.  Love the bread that comes before the meal.  I got the vegetarian pasta which is one of the few vegetarian items they have- bummer- it it was just okay.  I wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"Even though we have our dinner any where at South Charlotte, when my wife and we discuss about dessert , the first thing which comes to our mind is \"Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake ( hope I spelled that correctly) . 

Any sweet tooth friends out there, do not miss this awesome Cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"Kind of surprised to see so many negative reviews. My boyfriend and I frequent this location. Sure it can be busy at times, but our servers have always been friendly and attentive. Food has consistently been good each visit, aside from the last time when my Alfredo sauce on my pasta was a little watery. Was not too stoked on that, but I enjoyed my meal regardless. Bread is always good, and the new celebration cheesecake is a must try to anyone contemplating ordering it. I will say that it is more cake-like, but I'm not a huge fan of really heavy Cheesecake so I personally enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Our server was very patient with us considering that we were part of a big group but separate table."}
{"text":"We're not big fans of chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory is an exception.  You always know you're going to get tasty food, and a large serving (usually enough to share or take home half).  Plus, they've got a huge menu with a good number of veggie options (veggie burger, salads, pastas, sandwiches, etc).

I love love love their avocado eggrolls.  So much deliciousness wrapped in wonton skins and then fried, with a yummy cilantro sauce. MMMM.  Their corn cakes are also good, but the sauces on them aren't veggie; just ask for salsa instead.

I also love the brown bread they serve with all meals, even if you're just getting starters or cheesecake.  Speaking of which, they're actually pretty good, says my cheesecake snob partner (who is from NY), and big enough to share easily.

I've actually been over-serviced at multiple cheesecake locations, which I guess is better than not getting enough.  On NYE, we went here for Cheesecake, drinks and the free champagne toast; we had two almost identical servers who clearly didn't communicate, and the two of us wound up with four classes of bubbly instead of two. I'm not gonna argue.

They may have their off days for service, but their food is good, their menu long, and their servings big. It's hard to argue with that."}
{"text":"Great spot for a birthday dinner with a plethora of dessert options!

The wife and I met a couple of friends here for her birthday dinner and only waited about 15 minutes before being seated (at 6:15pm). We started with waters all around and a couple of cocktails: the strawberry martini and the factory peach Bellini, both drinks were very good 5/5. 

For appetizers we ordered the avocado spring rolls 5/5. 
The bread was also delivered with butter and the wheat loaf is always delicious. 

For entree's we ordered the Orange Chicken: deep fried pieces of chicken breast covered in sweet and spicy orange sauce accompanied with rice (white or brown) and veggies, usually lots of snow peas and some carrots 5/5, shrimp jambalaya delicious flavors 5/5, shrimp pasta 4/5, and the chicken salad with extra chicken 4/5.

For desserts we tried the white chocolate raspberry 5/5 and the Craig's crazy carrot cake cheesecake 5/5! Honestly I think all of heir desserts are 5/5!

Service was on top of everything and even came to sing 8-D.

Thank you for a nice birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"I was there with my family and a group of my mom's friends on Aug. 15, 2014.  

We had a larger group (about 16, though our reservation was for 20).  We were there just after the lunchtime rush.  My sister, mom and another family member (with a sleeping 18-month old child) were about 20 minutes early.  I asked to be seated.  I live in Massachusetts and the heat was quite a change, I desperately wanted an iced tea or something to drink.  The Hostess told us that though most of the area for our group was ready, she couldn't seat us as it might upset other patrons having lunch.  She was afraid that if others from our group came, it might be too noisy.  This is a group of military retirees, not a group of high school kids.  After asking a second time, this time to the manager, we were seated about 10 minutes before our group and the reservation time.

When it came time to order, we were broken up into groups on how we'd be paying.  I ordered the same thing I've gotten for years, Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps (from the appetizer menu).  My mom and sister both ordered the same.  The waiter told us about a lunch special but I told him, \"No, I prefer to make the wraps myself\" (as did my sister and mom).  About 20 minutes later, food was delivered, only it wasn't what we ordered.  They sent the pre-made lunch menu wraps.  The waiter told us that it was what we ordered.  Ummm, \"No, I distinctly told you the other wraps.  It's what we wanted and what we have always ordered in the past.\"  My sister wasn't willing to wait longer, she took what the waiter brought for her.  My mom and I sent the dishes back.  The waiter said our food would be out shortly.  So, 15 minutes later, out came the manager, apologizing and telling us food would be out soon.  He left the other two orders of wraps and said we could share them with the group, he said he didn't want to throw them out.  Okay, 30 more minutes and still no food.  Finally, as everyone was ready to order their desserts, I called over our waiter and cancelled our lunches.  I ordered a strawberry shortcake--which did come out.  

I was thoroughly disappointed.  The discord was evident between the waiter and the manager (who we were told was brand new to the location).  The manager was polite, but the waiter gave us a disgruntled earful.  

It was sad, my sister and I were only in town a very short time, this was supposed to be a fun outing, seeing old friends and having what should have been an enjoyable lunch.  

Were this my only experience with The Cheesecake Factory, I would likely never return.  I do know that they are usually much better."}
{"text":"Customer service was very average for a fine dining restaurant. The receptionist completely forgot about us. We waited around 45min-1 hour when there were more than plenty tables available. There were people who came in after us and were seated before and we were all parties of two. The food was also very average as well. We ordered the Pasta da Vinci and it was over cooked and a bit bland. Not our usual experience at a Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Had the chicken marsala. It was good. Had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake for dessert. It was very rich but good."}
{"text":"The food here is a solid three stars.  Nothing horrible about it, nothing great.  It's a standard menu with standard food that's a little overpriced for what you get.

But who really goes to a place called The Cheesecake Factory for their entrees?  They really do know how to make a good cheesecake, although you'll probably only need about half a slice.  Their filling is thick while still remaining creamy and full of flavor and the selection is astounding (the tiramisu cheesecake is my personal favorite).  I'm a huge cheesecake fan and I can dig theirs.  I still think my homemade ones are better, but you can't win them all.  

You can't beat this location though.  Sitting on the balcony and looking at the aquarium at the Forum Shops?  That pretty much wins."}
{"text":"Located in the Forum Shops area of Ceasers- it was a great place for lunch after a day of walking.  The outside dining is in the mall area.  The decor seemed like a \"mall version\" of this eatery...seemed a bit cramped.  They do have seating on the 2nd floor so it is larger than it seems.  The food is consistatly good, the service at this Cheesecake Factory was exceptionlal.  Prices seem better than other places on the strip- if you are hungry & want food you can count on at a fair price this is a good choice.  The Lousiana Shrimp I ordered was good but needed more zip in my opinion...but I like spice.  The Vietnamese Tacos were a tasty little start to out meal. The Sheila's chicken Salad was very yummy too!   We skipped the cheesecake....after all this eatery is now located all over the place.  I do love their cheesecake- but one cannot have dessert at every meal & stay in shape."}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit, not my overall opinion, because usually I'm a huge fan of this place. 
My daughter  chose this as her 11th birthday dinner location. We've always enjoyed their food and of course the cheesecake. We had a party of 9 on a Friday night. I called early in the week in attempts of making a reservation but they do not take them on weekends.  That was my 1st and main disappointment. I didn't want to have a large group (half kids) waiting long. I told my party to arrive at 7, I arrived about 15 min prior. Our total wait time ended up being about 25 minutes. Not too bad on a Friday night. 
We were sat at a beautiful big round table where everyone could see everyone. 
We ordered multiple apps and dishes including spinach dip, calamari, tex mex egg rolls, chicken picatta, garlic noodles, sliders, steak, shrimp, and more. 
Everything food wise was 4 stars easy. It did take a full on hour before we were eating though. They served us basket upon basket of bread but took forever on the real food. 
Service was 3 stars. Our waitress was nice, just overworked and slow. 
Cheesecake selections were red velvet, Oreo, Hershey's, and strawberry. 
Seriously can I say anything wrong? Of course not. 
I will return to Cheesecake Factory. Overall they are a great \"chain\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to many other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past and they were all amazing.

This location has some issues.

THE PORTION SIZES ARE SO SMALL! I got stuffed mushrooms and they are usually about the size of quarters or larger. These were the size of dimes and burned. I returned them and asked for a fresh plate. The next plate they were very small and dry. Just nowhere near the size or quality I expedited, so I returned them. The manager came and apologized and asked if he could anything to make it better. My wife'se tacos were very small as well, and the tortillas were not the same as the ones used at other locations. Our friend that went along with us said her sandwhich was also very small. Server n didn't bring out bread. Lame.

Great manager, but I won't return. I'll stick with the Chandler Mall."}
{"text":"The waiter was great.  I wish I could remember his name.   The food was out pretty fast.  Had a cheeseburger and it was done just the way I liked it."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has a wonderful concept, which accounts for their popularity.  And gift cards from family members are a wonderful idea for places you might not otherwise visit. LOL

The three of us came here last night to cash in on one of those gift cards. The suppose fifteen minute wait however morphed into forty minutes. Grrr.  Yet the servers here were all running around, busing tables and dropping off dishes like they were Olympian sprinters. I have never had my/our glasses refilled in such a prompt way before in my life. Incredible!

The food (photos) btw is good and I got to finally try Sheldon Cooper's Smokey BBQ Burger. It was great. So too are the cheesecakes.  The best by far is their open fire grilled burgers.  Everything else is just okay. 

This isn't our favorite place to dine out.  I've come here a few times by myself just for a burger at lunch. Expensive, but very good and less crazy. 

Now I remember many years ago sitting in front of some Kraft employees going home one night on METRA to Northfield, Illinois. They were complaining and laughing on how they couldn't get the cheesecakes that Kraft was thinking of introducing below 1,800 calories per serving. LOL. 

In the end, we decided to share the flourless chocolate cake.  Three spoons, three very full diners. Now where's the Lipitor?"}
{"text":"Best pork chop I've had in a while! Great service as well, overall a perfect night out with the family."}
{"text":"Well being its so much to choose from I believe it's over rated and pricey for the amount of food they give you also the rice was hard the steak was cook great the service is Great made sure to accommodate for the rice thank you"}
{"text":"I love love the cheesecake factory!!! There is something for everyone....no matter what you are in the mood for, they probably have it or something close"}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing. The variety is one of the best things about the menu. The only drawback is no reservations and you can end up waiting a long time at peak hours on the weekends. Cheesecake selection is great and will make the end of the meal special."}
{"text":"Good cheesecakes, everything else sucks. Went there for birthday, waited for 45-50 mins another hour for food. When food came got burger with buns hard as rock. Never going to this place again."}
{"text":"5 stars for the excellent service. Had an issue with my food and Ryan, the manager, came out right away to rectify the situation without me even having to ask to speak to a manager. I truly appreciated."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and decided to sit at the booth. Jeremy served us from the bar & made the experience. My friend and I both ordered the grilled fish tacos. The server suggested we share the plate considering there were 4 large tacos. The suggestion was spot on! The tacos were delicious and the perfect portion size. 
A glass of chianti and the fish tacos from this place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Went out with my entire family and it was just perfect. The mac n cheese burger is scrumptious. Everyone loved their food and the setting was great. There was a little wait but it was well worth the great food. Our server was very nice. We all left happy and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Always love this place. It's classy and elegant to begin with. Food is mild, but love the sea food here.  Took my brother here for the first time and he enjoyed his food a lot. Definitely DO NOT order burgers here, I think burgers aren't something that this place is known for. But definitely try the sea food and especially crab bites! Loved them. 
And ofcourse, Cakes!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a star because we were just a party of 2 who wanted & tried moving to a booth for two when a waitress came up to us & said  to sit where they assigned us & we couldn't sit at the unoccupied booth without permission. I was like okay I was about to ask the host. The host said it was fine & guess who was our waitress for the booth? The same rude waitress who told us we couldn't sit there meaning that it was most likely a part of her section. In my experience as a waitress, if my guests wanted to move to another table in my section they would be more then welcome to & not scolded. The worst part of our experience was we ordered our food and didn't get it until about an hour later. After the wait, you would think the food would be prepared well but both of our pasta dishes were dry. We had our waitress bring it back & the manager Aaron brought it to us & apologized. This occurred after the screw up which took up to an hour plus of our time. After arriving at 10pm & not getting our food till 11:10pm we were tired & just wanted to leave because we literally were one of the last tables before close. Our food was packed with no silverware as well. It's sad because it was our first night in town & we were hoping to be about but this cancelled our plans. Because of this experience, we won't be back at this location."}
{"text":"The epic tome of a menu makes for a fun decision process.  It was very busy Saturday night and we had good service and food.  I had both heathy choices and cheesecake and was very pleased with myself.  :)  

Apparently this is the place teen girls want to go for thier birthday.  If you are ever stuck trying to figure out a gift idea, get a Cheesecake Factory gift card.  You will be the coolest adult ever."}
{"text":"Great location and if you go for lunch on the weekends the parking is super easy, despite the weird token system they have at the Biltmore.

The waitstaff is always friendly, glasses are never empty, and they are willing to explain any item on the menu."}
{"text":"Other than the cheesecake, which is 5 stars, I have been severely disappointed in the food lately.  We did 1 take out order recently and the food was soggy and slimy when we got home. The cheesecake was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"I have to say, first, that the customer service that I received at The Cheesecake Factory went above and beyond, definitely.  My server was excellent and after an issue with a dish, the manager who visited my table also went way beyond what most would have bothered with, in particular since it's The Cheesecake Factory and losing one customer would seemingly not be a big deal, since I arrived at 5:15 on a Thursday evening to a packed house.  

I haven't been to the Factory in years.  I don't like going to the mall and I don't like waiting an inordinate amount of time to be seated.  I had a craving for cheesecake, so I made a run here after work.  Since it's attached to SouthPark mall, there seems to never be any down time at all.  Even upon my early arrival I had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  No biggie, I was seated within 5 or so minutes and instantly greeted by my server, Bonnie, who was absolutely fantastic.  She had her hands full and the section was completely booked, but she did a fantastic job.  I heard a table near me compliment how well she did, after she returned to thank them for what I assume was an extra-large tip.

The food:
Fried cheese sticks:  6 triangles.  Thick breading, nice melty cheese.  Marinara that was served with was meh.  Tasted weird, kind of plain, but nothing offensive.  
Fried chicken salad:  When they first opened this location, this was my go-to order.  Huge \"normal\" salad with fried chicken on top of it.  In the many years it has been since my last visit, the recipe has changed and I was not a fan of the new way.  The menu said \"mixed greens\" and I forgot that kale is no longer just a garnish.  Too much kale, way too much kale.  But the fried chicken served with it was quite good, as was the corn and pecans with the honey mustard dressing.  I picked through the salad, but it was mostly kale, so I just ate the chicken.  My server noticed and said she would bring me something else, but I told her it was my misunderstanding, no big deal, I ate all of the chicken and a few pieces of lettuce and that was fine.  
Turtle cheesecake:  Eh.... it was okay.  Creamy cheesecake with a healthy swirl of whipped cream.  Large dollop of a thick chocolate cream on top, plenty of nuts.  It was fine.  

The server let the manager (I believe he said his name was Johann) know about the salad and he came by the table and told me that had been taken off of my bill.   I told him as well that it wasn't necessary as I ate all of the chicken and what I could of the salad.  He again said it was taken care of and if I had any other problems to let him know.  Very nice and totally unexpected.  Excellent customer service.

I don't know when I will return, but the great job by my waitress and the manager on duty definitely left a very positive reflection on the place, I just wish the food was as good as the staff."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience in this Cheesecake Factory. I want to recognize Brandon who is a manager at the Cheesecake Factory. We had a small issue and he resolved it and exceeded our expectations. We come to this cheesecake all the time. We love it here. However when we come here it feels regular and the attention we receive was very warm and friendly something that I personally feel is missing from our dining experience. I'm very happy."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait...so come mid-afternoon or pick another place. 

Good food, expansive menu for entrees and of course, pages of dessert choices featuring things other than simply cheesecake. 

Bar can have VERY irregular service even when the place is empty. 

Outside dining is great--but place your ENTIRE order or you'll be waiting forever if you want dessert."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong here. The menu is huge, I'm sure you'll find Sumtin great. The bread is awesome. I love there burgers and burritos."}
{"text":"Good chain restaurant. This location isn't as busy as some of the others I have been to. I had the fish tacos and they were excellent. The cheese cake factory is always a good place to go to with a large group since they have so many choices on their menu. Everyone is bound to find something they will like!"}
{"text":"Love the food but super weird with such a long wait! At least be realistic with timing, add an extra 15-30 mins on your estimate - it was 45 min for takeout on Saturday at 9pm. Huge portions, really fresh cheesecake (perks of an extremely busy restaurant)! I really enjoyed the mango chicken salad and strawberry cheesecake. Fish and chips is a classic, also enough to share."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. I'm pretty sure it is a knock-off of The Cheesecake Warehouse in the Seattle area."}
{"text":"I went with my wife on a tuesday night at the restaurant and ordered Steak and Salmon dish. The Salmon was undercooked, so i asked the server to cook it more. 
The manager came back with the dish and told me this is your medium well salmon. 
I was offended by the way the manager handled the situation where he ruined my evening. 
I had been a chef and a manager for couple years and would never say such thing to a guest. 
This is an example of how some of the busiest places in town loose business."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed.  It was my birthday - we got to the mall at 5 and were told it would be an hour wait to check in and then another three hours to be seated.  We had a table of eight and then got all these excuses that they only have a certain amount of 'banquet tables' so where did you think you were building a restaurant!? Somewhere on the edge of P.E.I!?  Absolutely ridiculous, we've tried three other times to get seated at this place and it always goes like this.  Then the foolishness about not taking tables more the four or seven - really!? I will not bother ever trying to eat here again."}
{"text":"If you're not counting calories and you're hungry, swing on by to The Cheesecake Factory. Super cute and spacious restaurant located in the Premium Outlet Mall. The restaurant is very comfortable and is the perfect spot to catch up with your friends, stop by when you get hungry from all the shopping, or when you are craving a piece of cheesecake. They serve anything from fish and seafood, to salads, to sandwiches, to pastas! I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta when I'm here and I've been doing that for the past several years. You can't go wrong. They also have a skinny menu if you're trying to be healthy. Cheesecakes here are also a must. Save your tummy for a slice or take one home with you!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some cheesecake to go and well this may or may not be biased but their cheesecake just doesn't taste as good as I rememeber, that or I've just had a lot better elsewhere. Reeses was delicious but let's be real, you really cannot mess up a Reeses cheesecake... The red velvet however was extremely lacking and almost flavorless (minus the obvious super sweetness). I'm not a fan of processed food and pretty much everything that comes out of their kitchen (almost any chain restaurant) is processed. Too many gourmet scratch kitchens throughout the valley that I would prefer to support"}
{"text":"When I'm in the dumps my wife picks me up a piece of cheesecake. The slices have gotten so small and prices so high... Won't be back. 
They also did not respond to complaint on Twitter. 
Bye bye Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"Decided to drop by for lunch after shopping, on a Saturday afternoon. There was a small queue of people and we got a buzzer and was told it was a 20 minute wait. We actually got buzzed around 30 minutes later. I didn't like how once you were buzzed, you had to wait again before they called your name. There should be somebody to take you straight to your table once you are buzzed because there are too many people hanging around the hosting table.
We were seated and it took a while for our server to turn up. There is so much to choose from on the menus. I like variety but it was too much for me. We ordered Korean Fried Cauliflower, Pork Belly Sliders, Lunch Pizza & Caesar Salad, Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style and Meatloaf. The Fried Cauliflower was nicely fried and had good flavours. The pork Belly sliders were delicious, the bread is so soft. The chicken Parmesan Pizza style had good flavour without being too saucy or salty. It was a large size and I only managed to finish half. The meat loaf is a huge serving with 3 thick Slices of meatloaf. It was delicious but I would get the lunch size next time. The pizza and salad was ok. We couldn't eat any more good, so we got 3 slices of cheesecake to go. Each piece was lovely and you could taste all the ingredients in the descriptions. 
Had a lovely meal here but the pre seating is bad. Everyone just hovering and standing near the hosting station. Once you're buzzed, you need to queue up again to hand it in. Then wait again till someone calls your name to seat you."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is always good. But today, our server John, a server noob, was SO slow. 
5-10 minutes for initial greeting. 
10-15 more for the water and coffee I ordered. 
The usual 30 minutes for the meal. 

Like I said, food was good. 
Service, not so much."}
{"text":"Great service, food was good, my plate was plentiful (pasta napoletana), but my wife had a problem finding her chicken (Thai coconut chicken) .
The wait for a table wasn't bad considering the time 5:45 pm. Our waitress was friendly attentive, and knew the menu. Will definitely return and recommend. Our waitress was Megan S by the way"}
{"text":"2.5 stars
Took my mom and daughter out for early Mother's Day lunch. The wait was about an hour for us.  The service was ok, we did not know who our server was and it took her over 10 mins for her to get to us.  I don't mind waiting the 10 mins except she looked over at our table a few times and not said a word before she came.  It would have been nice to be acknowledged; like a \" I will be right with you\"... The service was decent throughout considering how busy it was.  
We enjoyed the food.  We ordered the Fried calamari, Herb crusted salmon, Chicken Mango and Avocado salad and kids menu chicken and vegetables.  The salad was my favourite, the dressing was superb.  I even ordered the same salad to go.  When I went to eat it for dinner, the salad had missing items!  My chicken Mango, and Avocado salad had NO avocados, 3 pieces of mango, and no almond slices... it was disappointing when I expected consistency.  $17 salad is not exactly cheap."}
{"text":"Never had as bad service as I had today. If you get \"Erin F.\" I highly recommend you ask for someone else. I could understand waiting for food but waiting  for a freakin slice of cheesecake for 40 mins AFTER eating is ridiculous. Anytime I've had a problem in the past the manager has asked how he could help. Nope not this time. Erin blamed the bakery for taking so long but others with other waiters got theirs quickly and no manager visited when I sent my Cheesecake back. Used to be one of my favorites places to go because of the variety and service. But nope! Never coming back. 

Oh and I forgot to mention she brought a birthday  sundae but when I mentioned I no longer wanted the cheesecake she took it back until I raised a stink! Nice birthday memory for my daughter!"}
{"text":"I go for lunch or Dinner at least Once a week... I was really Disappointed When i asked for my Chicken Wings For my appetizer ,, The waitress come and told me they are out of Wings.. REALLY??? How can you be out of something .. Does every table order them ?? is that why?
SO \"Louie\" the Mgr came  over and said Sorry..we are having trouble with the Kitchen Mgr and his ordering.. You guys Suck!"}
{"text":"Finally went to this location and didn't have a wait... Apparently going on a Monday around 2:00 is perfect! The staff was very friendly, the food super, like usual & the cheesecake amazing! My kids ordered cheese pizza & spaghetti with meatballs off of the children's menu and the spaghetti was outstanding! I almost wished I had order that for myself! Their appetizer salads are humungous and packed with great veggies! The Mac & cheese burger is out of this world too, very creamy & perfect! My daughters birthday was celebrated here and they brought out the cutest little sundae in a small wine glass and sang to her. Will definitely be returning, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing here! It's actually bigger than it looks from the outside which is nice because we didn't have a wait time to be seated . Love the dishes here. Fresh and top quality ."}
{"text":"I've been to 5 different Cheesecake Factory locations and this one became my 6th!

Overall, it was pretty good!
We still had to wait about 35 minutes for weekday's lunch, but the buzzer and the accurately estimated waiting time given to us allowed some freedom to walk around and do shopping. The buzzer actually worked when I was behind Victoria's Secret. 

Other than the fried calamari and Taco shells, everything we got was delicious.  The calamari only had tiny thin tentacles, no rings. When the plate got to us, the plate looked full of calamari, but it was exaggerated by batter and gaps since no ring parts were used.  So felt like we are just eating fried batter. 

The price was rather high.  Affordable and big portion was what we liked from the US restaurants, but here it costed over $30 a person with 1 appetizer and 2 soft drinks. 
Plus, $9 for a slice of cheesecake that isn't that special.  

Their service was great! 
Will visit again if we don't have to stand in line.

Edit: looked through some photos. Other people got the fried calamari rings. Why did we only get heavily battered tentacles? Thought that was odd. I guess we got someone's unwanted dish. :/"}
{"text":"Good family place. Place seems to be always packed. We had to wait 45 min for a table -normally i would go someplace else- but my daughter really wanted to go there and it was her bday so we ended up staying. 
Service was great and food even though took a little longer that usual was pretty good too. I don't know if i would wait another 45 min again but def would go back if there is no waiting time.."}
{"text":"It delivers.

Yes, it's part of a big chain, but I don't care.  This place is solid, it's consistent, and it delivers, over and over.

Their menu is vast.  I don't like that they don't seem to have a specialty, but they seem to get away with it.  A burrito or taco?  Excellent.  Some Italian food?  They nail it.  A burger and fries?  Solid.

And, of course, their huge variety of cheesecakes is part of the fun.  But here's a surprise - their coffee is really quite good (I'm hardcore, and most big restaurants serve crappy coffee).

Service, as expected, is consistently very good and efficient.  It's a big huge place, but they make it work.  Expect a colossal wait.  Put your name in and go browse the mall."}
{"text":"Normally I love their sweet potato fries but today they served me burnt crispy fries and totally skimped on the fry sauce too. The customer service which is normally pretty good was lacking today as well. Don't know if they are just having an off day or what but I am totally disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but it gets the one star for the terrible service. Hallie B was our waitress and she was terrible. She was so rude and had the biggest chip on her shoulder. I've never had such terrible service in my life. If you go make sure you don't sit in her section or be prepared for the worst service you've ever had. I just can't get over how obnoxious and how rude she was. I've never experienced anyone who was so unhappy to have a job in my life."}
{"text":"Started lining up at 6:37pm and sat down at 9:08pm. Ambiance, exactly like the states. I've attempted to order the Factory Combinations, instead of the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane, ($29.95) I wanted to substitute the steak Diane with the Miso salmon, unfortunately they wouldn't allow that. It seems that they are particular in terms of substitutions.

From the Small plates and snacks, I've ordered the 
Crispy crab bites -bite-sized little crab cakes, served with mustard sauce ($9.95) nothing to write home about.

Miso Salmon ($28.95) it was way too sweet to my liking and the sauce was too thick. The centre lacks flavour. The portion was huge, I rather the price reduced and the portion reduced so I will have room for what I initially came here for \"a cheesecake\"

The manager deserves as 4.5 star as he was very attentive, observant, friendly and came over to see if my bread was refilled. The server did not refill our water. We had a switch in waitress, both seems a little inexperienced.

The steak Diane was a bit dry. So out of the two entrees, I think the Chicken Madeira was the better choice. I think next time I will order less of the entrees and focus on trying different cheesecakes.

(3.5 stars)"}
{"text":"The name says it all! Cheesecake everywhere! The sizes of these portions are massive! Certainly a two sitting or two person take down! There's a lot of variations to choose from. Great location and great atmosphere all round. Takeaway service available too f you want to divulge elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I only rankn1 star because wait staff if awesome,  management couldn't be worse....I went with my kid and his girlfriend,  we sat at a 4 top. 11 people came behind us, kept getting pushed and elbowed, asked 4 manager. She, Alicia said it was fine,  I asked sincenonlyb4 chair's shouldn't that matter, she said there was enough chairs, treated us horribly....no one cared how we were mistreated...as we were leaving asked 4 manager again, another man came up said he would put is at a table,  wouldn't share bhhs name of other managers name....wow,  where is this considered customer service?"}
{"text":"My meal was amazing and the staff was friendly not as friendly as the one by chandler mall but not the worst either. I had the chicken Bellagio and would recommend it.  My dessert well that's mainly where the 5 stars came from ;-) I wouldn't care if my meal was horrible or the staff was the worst. The dessert was a 10. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. OMG! I have died and gone to heaven."}
{"text":"Brought a friend to Las Vegas this weekend for her birthday and to see my dad. 

It's her birthday so I let her pick where she wants to go all weekend, including dinner on Saturday. She picks Cheesecake Factory.

Short wait as we opted to sit outside under the heat lamps. We're one of three parties who braved the chilly night but it wasn't too cold that we were miserable. 

The service was awesome. I don't remember his name but it's guys like our server that make dining experiences memorable. 

My friend had a Kobe burger that was cooked just as she ordered it. The cooks even cut it in half for her as per her request. 

I opted for the Salisbury Steak which was so good that my friend had a few bites. The mashed potatoes complimented the entree and both meals came out piping hot. 

Parking seems like it can be trying but we lucked out right away."}
{"text":"I probably go to Cheesecake Factory maybe once a year but I'm always satisfied. They have the biggest menu ever and there is something for everybody. Whether it's lunch or dinner, you'll be happy going here."}
{"text":"For a first timer I must say I was overwhelmed. They had a wide array of choices on the menu. If you don't know exactly what you want you will be searching for awhile. I will say that the bread they served was GREAT and I could not get enough. I ended up ordering the Chicken Riesling. It was good, but it felt like it was missing additional seasoning in the sauce. 

They are very generous with serving size, and I was able to take some home. Next time I go I will definitely have to try the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Very extensive menu!!! I had about 5 things I was torn between after reading many reviews but went with what my Dad recommended prior to my first visit...MEATLOAF!!

Meatloaf was the bomb.com!!! Best I have had out in years and you get so much of it!! Don't get enough of the corn that comes with it and is the bomb also.

Got the best cheesecake ever also...had a weird name like Christopher ' s out there cake or something. Was like German chocolate cake but cheesecake....it was so good!! 

Out of all the wonderful tempting choices, the ones I made I was highly satisfied with. Be prepared to spend some money but it is a fancy (and frigid) restaurant.

Wish they had more locations in NC and more than 1 in the citys  they are in."}
{"text":"The service was great; our server called us 'princess' which was cute. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered from the 'Small Plates' menu,the Greek Salad and Chicken Samosas. I loved the salad and the Samosas were nice and spicy."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my family's go-to restaurants, whether it be for dinner on the weekend or when we're celebrating a special occasion. The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is very extensive, a bit overwhelming at that! With the menu consisting of just about 20 pages, everyone is bound to find something they'll enjoy. The food is consistent, always fresh, and the portions are ridiculously huge. I always have leftovers for lunch the next day!

A few of my favorite dishes include the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad and the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. 

If you have room, there are over 50 cheesecakes and various desserts to choose from! We normally come to an agreement (which can be hard) and share a slice! Seriously, after a meal here, a slice of cheesecake will push you to the edge.

During our most recent visit, we received the most outstanding service from Aiden! He was on his A-game from start to finish, exceptional to say the least. He was very informative when we had questions about items on the menu and even recommended a few of his favorites! Aiden was constantly checking up on my family and always made sure that our waters (and bread basket) were filled. Not to mention, he can really carry a tune! We were very impressed! Thank you, Aiden!

Now, if only it wasn't so dark inside the restaurant! The ambience is nice, don't get me wrong, but I wish the lighting wasn't so dim! There was a single light shining down from the high ceiling in the middle of our table, and everyone was taking turns using it to read the menu. I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it's true. With the sun going down sooner in the day, there's not much natural light left to come through the windows before dinnertime.

Overall, great location, great service, and most importantly, great food!"}
{"text":"From start to finish,  experience was amazing. Ambience was amazing and staff was always nearby and helpful.  Best Cheesecake Factory to date."}
{"text":"As many times as I've been here, I can't believe I've never written a review. In a creature of habit, always order the Luisiana chicken pasta without the mushrooms. It was yummy tonight, sometimes the noodles are bit more aldente than I prefer, but tonight they were great. The chicken in the dish was lacking, but nonetheless I enjoyed my meal in in it's entirety. Surprisingly I don't even eat cheesecake but the do make some pretty decent food. Tonight we were seated immediately, and our food didn't take too long to come out. our waitress was in training, and she did just fine. Of course they're conveniently locate @ South Park Mall, entrance right where the valet stand is, check them out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good options to choose from the \"skinnylicious\" menu and the salads/foods are under like 590 calories. I got the factory salad with no bacon and it was very good. The other salads that are listed in menu are around 1000 calories for just a salad. Can't imagine how much calories is in the rest of the menu. :0"}
{"text":"My husband and myself have had many positive experiences at this Cheesecake Factory but the last time we were in it was much different. While I understand things happen my husband had the parchment paper in his dinner the full sheet was under his chicken when we told the waitress she said that she would get the manager the manager never did come to the table to address the situation while our meals and appetizers came at the same time therefore we did not get to enjoy this dinner sadly"}
{"text":"I would rather eat cardboard with a little seasoning salt on it, there have another meal here at the cheese cake factory.  My last time here I ordered a pasta dish the pasta was dry and the tomato sauce did not adhere to the noodles.  Aladdin's cheese cake better any way ."}
{"text":"What was life without the cheesecake factory in Toronto? Probably involved driving down to Buffalo for a day of shopping at Walden Galleria before lining up to eat at the cheesecake factory. Well, now you don't need to cross the border! Since the initial rush has died down a bit, you might be able to get a table within a reasonable amount of time, depending when you choose to go. We got there early on a Sunday morning and when we were seated at 11:30, the wait was already 75-90 min long. YMMV. Make sure you ask what's the range of the buzzer or you might miss it.

When it comes to food, my go-to appetizer, the fried chicken sliders were ON POINT. If you don't like pickles, you'll want to try them here because it makes the whole slider. My go-to main, the chicken and biscuits were the best I've had so far since they put the biscuits on top so it doesn't get soggy from the gravy. Other dishes we had were the fried fish tacos and the Thai coconut-lime chicken. The fish was great, and chipotle sauce added a nice kick. The Thai coconut-lime chicken was quite flavorful - one thing to note about all the mains is that they're HUGE. We each only finished half the plate and took the rest home. So even though the prices seem expensive, you do get what you pay for. If you do pack leftovers, make sure you tell them what you want to keep. They didn't even give me the gravy. *insert angry face*

All in all, the food lives up to the name so you really don't need to goto Buffalo - however you could be waiting for hours to get a table. The size of the restaurant is definitely too small for its popularity and the kitchen could probably be bigger to get dishes out faster to accommodate demand. Oh well, they do have high standards for quality, and when a dish didn't come out on time they owned it and left us with a great impression. We will be back! 5/5 (if you get a table quickly)."}
{"text":"Decided to give Cheesecake Factory another try and was once again very disappointed. This restaurant nickel and dimes you to death. When you order their dishes they come out with very little sauce, when you ask for more they charge you $2 - $3 dollars extra. This is petty and unacceptable. With the hundreds of fabulous restaurants in town to choose from I don't know why anyone would choose this tired chain option. The pride they once put into the preparation of their menu is gone avoid this place and go to an establishment that values their customers."}
{"text":"Okay let's get on my tinsy winsy soap box for a moment.  My guess as to some of the low star reviews for the CheeseCake Factory at the WestTowne Mall in Madison, Wis. is related to trained labor or shortages of same.  In 2017 almost all service jobs in this city have help wanted signs out and this for a while.   Also I'd have to say if there is turn over at any restaurant almost anywhere in USA that compensation is directly associated as the main factor. IMO.  If you have seen my other reviews I've mentioned the compensation methods of USA wait staffs everywhere is the target reason for turnover.  Even restaurants get what they pay for.  Okay, off soap box now.

As the Shopping Mall era keeps setting into the sunset in lieu of the big online phenomena, I could make a case that restaurants like the Cheesecake factory are evolving into the new anchor stores, I mean the others all seem to be singing Anchors Aweigh.  So if an old guy like me will go to a mall for the Cheesecake Factory it's got to be a good reason.  Duhhh.  Even though our Factory here in Madison seems more marketed to women, I don't mind a bit, I can coffee and chit chat too, even order off the ' Skinnylicious ' menu, speaking of menus I also don't mind the main menu being a Book!, It's called selection.  (If you think I'm overdoing the dead mall syndrome, check out Dan Bell and his Youtube series ' Dead Mall Series ', yes people, it's a thing.) 
- - - - - - - - - - -
So, my fav dish was the Thai Salmon with rice (extra butter, Hey! this is Wis. and the place is called ' CheeseCake --- ', so don't go there!) tasty sauce and nicely done veggies of the Asian style flavors, Oh, just--love--that--dish!  Unfortunately our CCFactory has discontinued that particular salmon dish, (almost always ordered that dish) but there are several others with similar fixins and making your own construction is allowed, and, will mention here, if things go wrong, you tell them about it and it should or will be fixed NOW.    So this allowed me to order special salads which I also have enjoyed.  The coffee is okay, not great but not bad either, seems restaurants have trouble keeping great coffee on request, so this is another plus for CCF.  Need I mention the desserts or complete takeout desserts since usually can't stuff any more in the pie hole by end of entré time.  So the CCF being right in a mall can also be handy for any kind of other errands nearby.  Confession: When we travel across country we keep running into Starbucks and Cheesecake factories, just seems to keep happening.  I blame it on the internet.  

Others seem unimpressed (millennials?) with this cheesecake factory, I'll blame that on the general lowered expectations of younger generations who don't know what to make of excess when they see it.  Having choices and enjoying same is a real adventure, but considering the future picture of USA, I can see them being depressed and unable to enjoy a restaurant style that is disappearing quickly in this newer age.  To me the Cheesecake Factory is a blast from the past to be enjoyed, and for a mall, a destination."}
{"text":"Was seated right away.  Service was good.  Iced tea and bread with butter were good.  Avocado egg rolls were delicious.  I liked the Chicken Madeira but my daughter didn't care much for it.  Was not able to stay for dessert."}
{"text":"Terrible service. 10:15p.m. on a slow Thursday night: 10 minutes to wait for a table, 12 minutes to wait to even get acknowledged by a server...and that's only because I had to flag her down to get attention. Pathetic!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entrées and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!

That said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for years and when National Cheesecake Day with half priced cheesecake came up, that was as good a time as any!  I went on a Friday afternoon and the the dining area had a lot of people, almost packed.  I wasn't too fond of the way seating is done here (as I felt I was in the couple's food next table over), the waitress was really attentive and friendly.  I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it is delicious!  It's well seasoned, creamy and the meat is tender, not chewy.  For dessert I had the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake, which is served with a generous side of whipped topping and chocolate chips.  I can't wait to come back again for another meal!"}
{"text":"Been going to the Cheesecake factory off and on for many years. I agree with other posts that the prices are too high. At the same time, the size of the servings are getting smaller. I usually order Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. The last time we went - was the worst. I don't know if its the cook or they changed the recipe. Won't be returning any time soon. Service was poor and the food disappointing. Cheesecake still amazing just very expensive with smaller serving size."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and great service. Highly recommend this place. Been there twice over two year's  and both times were great. Wait was reasonable to get a table both times. Got desert because it looked so good, had to take it to go, I was too full."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat -- love the avocado egg rolls! Hubby enjoys the Cajun seafood jambalaya. And the cheesecake, oh, the cheesecake! YUM! I love the mango key lime!  
At first I was disappointed in our waitress - we thought she had forgotten about us when she went to refill my Sprite, but she was changing the syrup so it wasn't straight soda water and the syrup spilled all over her - poor thing! She couldn't apologize enough for the accident, very sweet."}

Brianna the name of waitress she is the best lol thank you so much"}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday evening and were able to snag a table for two in the bar without waiting at all. Maybe just luck? Our food was delicious, server Kristina was wonderful- very personable, sweet, and attentive. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I will NEVER go to this location as long as it's in existence!!! My sister and I frequent this location a lot! At least once or twice a month and have never had an issue until tonight!!!! 

My sister arrived earlier than me and decided to to score a booth in the bar area where the hostess came and shooed her out of the booth. The hostess then proceeds to advise her that she was only allowed to sit at the bar in order to participate in happy hour even though none of the booths were occupied. I was very confused because we have sat in booths in the bar area several time and never encountered an issue. 

Finally I arrive and wanted to speak to a manager because it didn't seem right and inconsistent. Well here comes Sam....whom was extremely rude to us. He wasn't interested in anything we had to say and accused us of complaining. I told him we weren't complaining and was just curious of the inconsistency and I really didn't want to sit at the bar in order to be able to order off of the happy hour menu. He then tells us to go to another restaurant like Brio so my sister then tells him \"it feels as if you don't want us here, like you're trying to get to get rid of us!\" He continued to be rid so ultimately we left and found our new favorite spot Wolf Gang Puck in Summerlin. 

I called to corporate office the next day and spoke with a gentleman who took down my concern and contact information and I waited a month and still no response. I ended up calling corporate again where they issued me $20 eGift card which I ended up using at the San Francisco CCF. I will not be going back to the CCF. I don't like how they handle customers or their concerns."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived early on a Sunday for brunch.  Our server William was very helpful and friendly.  He went over the menu and asked if we had any questions as I had never been there before.  I told him it really wasn't necessary because even though I hadn't been there before, I was far from unprepared.  He then went on to tell is, \"It's going to be a good day\" and how he picks one day every three weeks or so and decides it's going to be his birthday.  I like the way he thinks.

It felt like MY birthday when my Morning Quesadilla arrived.  There were so many goodies in there, I couldn't believe it.  And goodies on the side, too - heaping piles of salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  So delicious.  I highly recommend.  I also ordered the Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes because I've heard such good things about them.  They tasted almost as good as they smelled which was heavenly.  But after my quesadilla I was only able to eat a portion of the pancakes, even when assisted by my friend.  I took home the leftovers and they were still delicious the next day.

I also ordered a piece of Godiva cheesecake to go.  I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a piece of their cheesecake and this was some chocolatey goodness.

The place was hopping when we left, so I would recommend getting there early (i.e. when they open) to enjoy the brunch menu."}
{"text":"You want the best cheesecake in town? Go to Rocco's on Buffalo, next go to the Bagel Cafe.  Don't get cheesecake at the factory.  Then if you get to the food at cheesecake factory, it has gone downhill over the years."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night for my father's birthday and we had to wait two long hours to be seated (there were 12 of us - 6 of which were kids). Food was awesome (and came quickly) and our server, Dave (I think), was great. One star for our server, the other for the food, and the third for the yummy cheesecake. Minus two stars for the horrible and unfriendly hostesses and long wait."}
{"text":"It's National Cheesecake Day today so, of course, we weren't going to pass up the half-off cheesecakes at The Cheesecake Factory! My family and I were in the area so we decided to get our cheesecake fix at this location. I asked my husband to go in with our son to purchase our cheesecakes while our daughter and I stay in the car. When he came back he told me that the cashier \"Diana\" had charged him the third slice at regular price because there was only two of them in the restaurant, but she didn't tell him ahead of time that there was a limit of one per customer. Last year I was able to purchase three cheesecakes by myself at another location. Anyway, it would've been fine if he could only purchase the two at half-off, but this cashier should've informed him if they had a limit so he didn't have to go through the trouble of returning it. Such poor customer service. And he even left tip in her empty tip jar! But just now after reading the others reviews from the past month, I guess I shouldn't be surprised of this location's very poor customer service. Needless to say, we won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Completely in love with this place. They have amazing food and excellent customer service. I love the enchiladas and the orange chicken. I've had different items from the menu and I've loved them all. Also can't miss dessert. My favorite is the dulce de leche cheesecake."}
{"text":"I forgot to update this but after we ate here, I took home my leftovers and when I heated it up the day after, there was sooooo much grease in the bottom of my plate. And if I tilted it over to the side as if I'm draining it, even more grease accumulated- like a quarter cup of it. Needless to say, I threw it out. The pasta is good but I'm pretty sure the dim lighting is what covers up people from seeing the grease."}
{"text":"It's the season for Pumpkin Cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory have the best Pumpkin Cheesecake and  Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. Make sure to order ahead of time for Thanksgiving!!!"}
{"text":"Came for desert. Not a long wait which was great since there was to events going on in the area. Server was friendly and fast. Cheese cake was amazing! Always a plus. The table and surrounding area was clean."}
{"text":"We came on a very busy and loud night, lacked with middle-aged people.  I didn't order much, since there wasn't anything that intrigued me enough in the entree section. I had the spinach artichoke dip, something I've enjoyed everywhere I go and can't get disappointed with. Everyone else had large portion sizes. Even though it was an extremely busy night, we still got our food relatively fast!"}
{"text":"Lately, things have improved - decided to give this place another chance after getting gift cards for filling out survey. Meal quality now consistent, take-out service improved (weekends are understandably quite busy here). Back to being a regular  yay!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has to be one of the best \"staple\" go to places in the US.  No matter what state you are in you know you can go here and have a great meal.

I have been going to Cheesecake for years as it is right down the street from my work and we pop in to have lunch at the bar.  I don't know if i've ever had anything bad from this place before.  their portions are always great for leftovers and the service is never bad in my experience.  

You honestly can't go wrong with this place as they have almost every type of cuisine you can think of.  Oh ya I also hear they have something called cheesecake.  They might have a couple of different kinds for you to try if you're into something that tastes like heaven mixed with cream cheese and sugar.  

No matter what city you're in you can always feel at home at a Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Der lange Weg durch die Forum Shops im Caesars Palace war es wert: das Schlaraffenland für Cheesecake Fans. Der Laden macht seinem Namen alle Ehre. Die Auswahl ist riesig, geschätzt 30 Varianten von Original, Oreo, Nussig, Fruchtig (z.b. mit Himbeeren), Karamell, White Chocolate... ich kanns gar nicht alles aufzählen. Wer hier nicht auf den Geschmack kommt, selber schuld. 
Ich hatte den White-Choclate-Rasberry Traum und mein Mann den Herscheys-Chocolate Cheesecake. Beide waren meeeega lecker!!! 
Die Bedienung war sehr zuvorkommend. Preise liegen zwischen 7 und 8 USD, kann aber locker von der Größe her mit einem Mittagessen konkurieren. 
Yummi - ich komme wieder!!!!"}
{"text":"Wait for a table at 3pm. Very expensive lunch with a glass of wine and cheesecake."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch with my sister and friend yesterday. We ordered the calamari, Oriental salad and the eggplant sandwich. All three were delish. Vanilla bean cheesecake was terrific. We all shared. Our waiter was awesome. Always a great time at the Factory."}
{"text":"Great visit, a brief 10 minute wait on Sunday evening at about 5:30.  Staff was quick to ensure that every need was met.  I had the chicken and shrimp gumbo while my wife had orange chicken.  Both were excellent!! The staff took our sons order right away so he would not have to wait.  Desert goes without saying, it was awesome!!!Great experience, definitely will be a return visit!!!"}
{"text":"Why do people eat here?  It was packed on a Thursday night.  We had to eat in the bar to avoid a 20 minute wait to be seated.  Everything on the menu is SOOO Expensive.  The only reason we stayed and ate is we had a $50 gift card.

Wanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty.

With three cocktails (A mojito for me and 2 gin and tonics for him), the sundae and slice of cheesecake, with tip was $45).  I think that is quite a bit.

The best part was the free bread, no joke.  Service was pretty horrid as well."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to receive a to-go slice of cheesecake because the ticket was lost."}
{"text":"Love this place! Haven't had a bad meal here in all the years we have been coming. Everyone is very nice and attentive. It does get super busy so you have to go on the off peak times and you get seated right away."}
{"text":"I ordered the lemon chicken and it came out raw. The manager offered to cook the rest of my half eaten chicken. Not sure if I'd go there to eat chicken again or to even eat for lunch breakfast or dinner but everything else was delicious and by that I'm talking of the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten my meal and already having a terrible experience. Took 7 minutes for a server to come and greet us, never introduced herself, brought over our drinks. Bread hasn't even come to the table. She's more focused on all her other tables and guess what? They all have bread..
Driver over an hour and a half for this?"}
{"text":"Food wasn't that good and very expensive. Thank God we had a gift certificate 
Orange chicken was dry, and tasteless.
Bang Bang chicken for $18 was not very good. 
Won't be back"}
{"text":"We have been to this location multiple times. We often have problems with the food: either it comes out cold, or modifications are incorrect. Servers are are friendly and always get a cheesecake to go."}
{"text":"We managed to get in On black Friday y'all. Okay, it wasn't the most ideal time for us to have dinner, but I wanted their cheesecake. Just had to stand in line for 20 min around 3pm to get the buzzer, then we just shopped for 80 min until our table was ready.

I gotta say the manager escorting the parties in for the buzzer needs to be more authoritative and control that line better. As soon as he came people just rushed to him and some people lost their place in line. I had to speak up so jabronis wouldn't bud in front of me.

Aside from the soft manager, everyone else inside the restaurant were superb. Even with all the crazy tempered shoppers, they kept their cool. Our waiter was very kind and tentative.

Food was good and cheesecake was amazing. We ordered too much and packed it up for later."}
{"text":"Overall I don't really mind the cheesecake factory.  I just think that if you're looking for a nice place to eat there are MUCH better options that something attached to the South Park Mall.  

The wait is always atrocious and even when you do have reservations it's doubtful that you'll actually get seated on time.  The food is overpriced for the quality you are getting.  The waitstaff is nice but they are busy because the place is enormous.

The atmosphere is corny.  I can't think of any other way to describe it.

Do yourself a favor and take a look around when you walk in there.  Stop being a stereotypical American and go eat at an independently owned shop.  My bet is you will be much happier, eat about 2,000 less calories, and get out the door for a heck of a lot cheaper!

If you really need a piece of cheesecake - get it to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, but last night I was very disappointed. Our server didn't greet herself so I don't even know her name, but we had found hair in our food so of course we asked for our server and she simply said \"Oh I'm sorry\" did not get the manager or anything to fix the problem. I'm usually very easy going but seriously the customer service was TERRIBLE last night especially for how nice the restaurant is supposed to be for the price. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. Everything was hot and fresh. The only downfall is the hard yard chairs that you got to sit on."}
{"text":"After checking out of our hotel (the Arizona Biltmore, which was just a few minutes away), we wanted a nice brunch, so we came to The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to other locations, but never this one. It was clean and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. It was hard to choose from their usual huge menu, everything looked great! I had the green chilaquiles with carnitas and eggs. Unfortunately, they were cold when they brought it to our table. Luckily the kind service immediately brought them back to the kitchen and when they came out again they were very delicious (and warm!). I would definitely come back to this location for the wonderful service."}
{"text":"Always a good setting and great food.  The Almond Crusted Salmon Salad is a hit.  This is one of my favorite places in Henderson by far!  Did I mention the assortment of cheesecakes for dessert?"}
{"text":"I ordered again same meal and it was done to perfection. I think its great that they acknowledged the mistake and fixed for the issue I wrote about, I was not and still am not after anything free, but was surprised they did not offer to correct the meal,  Oh well, i had a good meal tonight. Back on top guys!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends and it didn't take long to get seated. I love their extensive menu. I ordered a flatbread off the Skinnylicious menu and it was delicious! Dessert was great as well. Our server was fantastic. Great service and great food - I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about this place except that the music is usually to loud.  Tonight i took mom there for dinner.  She was sitting across from me and we couldn't even hear each other talk.   And it wasn't even dinner music.  It was something that would be fitting for a night club/ dance party. 

Food is always awesome, service is spot on, hostesses are great, atmosphere  (sight, not sound) is beautiful, restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I ordered calamari,had better in maggianos, ordered stuffed mushrooms..had better at Olive Garden.. There is something about this place that just doesn't give me the \"I want to go back the food was that good\" vibe... Cheesecakes are great,so I guess I could come back for some of those!"}
{"text":"It seems like every time I go to Cheesecake Factory my fork and knife in the roll up is caked with old food.... Seriously are you guys doing roll ups in the dark or do you just not care that when I unroll my utensils that I see other peoples left over food all over my fork and knife and you think it's ok to give that to me? I wonder how clean everything else is if repeatedly this issue happens and no one cares to resolve it. Disappointing and disgusting."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend and gorged on their most popular chicken dish, I think it was the Chicken Costoletta.  We had appetizers, the warm asparagus salad and cheesecake, of course.  They were super busy, but even through their business, Alex was an amazing server.  He was cheerful and thoughtful.....he made us laugh.  :) It was an addition that made our night better.  Food was great, dessert was insanely great and service was phenomenal.  It just gets so busy and the setting is pretty loud so we don't come here often."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE EVER! waited in line for a full hour, and were told we could not reserve a spot as they were only accepting parties of four or less!VERY POORLY ORGANIZED, and the hostess had the audacity to roll her eyes when we asked questions! the inadequate behaviour was an extreme turn off, and made us never want to come back. my friend was extremely upset as we came here to celebrate her birthday, but only received negativity and rudeness! 0/5 would not recommend"}
{"text":"I typically love The Cheesecake Factory, but lately their service is terrible. Last Saturday my husband and I ate there around 9pm. We had a nice, older, dark haired lady as our server. She was friendly, but absolutely clueless. First sge brought out loaded potato soup and forgot the bacon. We waited 10 minutes for the bacon and the soup was cold. Then I had a bbq burger and she forgot the sweet potato fries, so I was left to wait 10 minutes for fries and by then my husband had finished his catfish. Needless to say, I ate alone while my husband waited for me to eat. This all happened after already waiting 30 minutes for our food, even though the place was dead! The only positive things I can say is that I enjoyed the Strawberry Creamsicle and potato soup. This restaurant is too overpriced for the lack of good customer service."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience.  My Mom had the Herb Crusted Salmon a day loved it. I had the Skinnylicious Mexican Tortilla Salad.  This thing is wonderful I can't believe it's actually healthy!   The tortilla the beans and chicken rest upon are a nice surprise in the center.  They make the best Arnold Palmer soft drinks (half lemonade and iced tea).  Love it!  Our server was awesome as usual, and love the brown bread they serve.  I wish you could purchase it as well to go!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the entire staff at this location hates the company but they don't seem to be giving Cheesecake Factory a good name.  I've been to all 3 Las Vegas locations on more than one occasion but this experience has to be the worst by far.  I'm not one to complain but this was too many mistakes to go unnoticed. 

The evening started seemingly ok.  The hostess took our name, said the wait would be 20 minutes and then handed us a beeper.  When 30 minutes past I went back up to ask where we were in the line.  She stated that she called us, which was impossible since we were sitting on the bench next to her stand.  Also, the beeper never went off so that onto itself was a lie.  Why give one to us a beeper if you aren't going to use it?  

We sat down and our waitress seemed very nice (probably the only employee I didn't mind).  My boyfriend and I ordered our food but for some reason the food runner only brought out his food.  I sat and waited for a bit but then our waitress looked at my empty place setting and stormed off.  She came out immediately after with my food.  At the end of the meal, we ordered a slice of cheesecake to have at the restaurant but the food runner gave us our cheesecake in a \"to go\" box.  Our waitress again looked angry.  

Lastly, today I opened my box of leftover pasta to find that my boyfriend's jalapeno peppers were mixed in with it.  He finished his meal and there wasn't anything left on his plate except the peppers. I found them everywhere in my food, they just weren't placed on top or on the side.  I decided not to eat it since someone messed with it enough to mix ingredients in.  Gross."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the small plates and appetizers. They have a lower calorie menu (Skinnylicious Menu) and lots of mixed drink options. And can't forget about the cheesecake!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I went to a lunch here with my sister and her family. It was pretty busy, but luckily they got there first to wait for the table. The waitress was super nice. I ordered some sort of pesto pasta that had chicken and prosciutto in it. Everything was delicious. I would've normally given this place 4 stars because I have to be really impressed to get a 5, but when that cheesecake hit my tongue that bumped it up the extra star. Glad that they live up to the hype of their cheesecake."}
{"text":"Amazing Service & Food was incredible! I asked for a recommendation from Roland the bartender and he said \"Herbed salmon, mashed potatoes & asparagus!\" He was not wrong... The food was perfect! Fresh salmon with sauce that was excellent! Potatoes and asparagus were delicious as well as the bread and sweet tea! The property is beautiful and everything was outstanding!!! An all-around wonderful experience!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeaway tonight- chicken fettuccine and chicken carbonara. We picked it up promptly and then drove 10 minutes home. I found the food pretty flavorless along with the fact that the chicken fettuccine portion was pretty small. Over all I did not find this restaurant worth the $20 bucks a pasta dish. I was better heading off to any other pasta restaurant and really regret getting dinner here on my birthday."}
{"text":"If you're willing to come to The Cheesecake Factory for a bite to eat one day, coming during Happy Hour is a must! It's from 4-6 PM every weekday and it's half-off alcoholic drinks and select appetizers.
My two friends and I came here during Happy Hour and we were expecting it to be a little busy, but it really wasn't once we walked in...of course it's a Wednesday afternoon.
I tried the fried Mac and Cheese, which was excellent, along with a $5.95 margarita. What a deal that was. I'm glad I came during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed at their service and food. My family and friends family all went here for Easter lunch and our server was MIA most of the time and the food was dry or burnt. We tried to flag down our server to let her know about the burnt meatloaf but couldn't find her so we told the bus boy and he took the dish back. When finally our server came we had to reminder her of our returned food and she just nonchalantly told us it was taken off our bill because she thought we wouldn't want a new dish... Shouldn't she ask us first?!?! Then she added that the kitchen put the meatloaf and forgot about it. They knew the food was inedible but still brought it out to us?! I was totally disgusted at the servers behavior and the lack of attention and care the kitchen put into what the customers were eating. I would not go back, there are plenty of good restaurants with excellent service. I think the Cheesecake Factory is just a hype with overpriced, mediocre at best, food with bad service. The only friendly staff was the bus boy. Too bad I can't give 0 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but my husband loves the Cheesecake Factory, so I indulge every so often.   I've never had a bad meal here, but as other Yelpers have mentioned, the menu is huge.  My favorite dish here is the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp.   The referenced proteins arrive bathed in a wonderfully spicy sauce, accompanied by a mound of white rice, blackbeans, fried plantains and mango salsa(I always order extra).  I also order a vegetable side (green beans, this time).   The portion is huge and because the plantains and salsa are sweet, I typically don't crave dessert (no cheesecake), after eating this meal.  My husband had the thick cut pork chop and mashed redskin potatoes w/spinach on the side.   He thoroughly enjoyed his meal.   All in all this was a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"Totally a fan of cheesecake factory.
Wasn't busy and we got $7 valet anyways.
They validate if you self park.
Only downside: my bench seat is in need of repairs"}
{"text":"I came here for my 21st birthday back in May. I was seated 10 minutes after arriving. They have a bar where you can just sit down at and drink a bit. They also have a to-go station where you can also order cheesecake by the slices or by whole! The server (I can't remember his name sadly) was really amazing! He made sure that my birthday was special. I got the shrimp summer rolls to start off. Sooo delicious. The sauce was amazing! Even the plating was beautiful! For the main plate I got the Chicken Madeira. I now know why it's the most popular plate. It's so big and just amazing. So many flavors. I could not find one bad thing about it. I also got a tall blue moon. That was a little weird because it didn't have any foam which means it was sitting out for a while. I was way too full to even get cheesecake but the food was definitely worth it. All in all, amazing! I love the food, layout, and service here!"}
{"text":"My family and I just stopped in for a piece of cheesecake. We were seated right away by a cheerful hostess.  Our server, Jessie was great! Very friendly and helpful. If the rest of the waitstaff is as nice as her, I would recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone."}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese burger was ok. Not what I was expecting. Service was great. Our waitress, Ashleigh P. was fantastic. Patient and helpful, answered all our questions and was very accommodating. Never felt rushed and she checked on us enough to not be over bearing."}
{"text":"I only purchased a piece of cheesecake to go. My review is based on the take out counter service. It was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Why does everyone hate chains? They are chains because their food is tasty and their menu works. I'm sorry if it's not owned by vagrant bohemians. I'm one of the masses!

My friend, who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, works here and she makes fun of me for wanting to eat there. She makes fun of me for thinking it tastes good. 

Everything I've ever had there is very good. Avacodo eggrolls make me smile.

{"text":"Delicious mall food in a great location!! Always a good choice"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite spots to eat and order to go from. This particular time I was very upset. We ordered from door dash which i had no complaints about. The issue was our order, the restaurant gave us a call saying they were out of Nashville nuggets which was a big upset. Secondly, I told the lady on the phone I wanted everything extra spicy she said that she could make it \"a little\" more spicy which that was something I didn't want to hear after I said I wanted it EXTRA SPICY and told her twice over the phone to ensure it was understood that I wasn't it extra spicy! They couldn't make the buffalo blast more spicy, which was understandable. As for the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was suppose to be somewhat spicy to start hence the name \"Cajun\" jambalaya pasta wasn't spicy at all. My girlfriend ended up eating the shrimp and chicken out and giving the pasta to the kids since it wasn't one spec of spice in sight.  As for the buffalo blast, everything fell apart and it was hardly any blue cheese. I'm very disappointed and extremely upset with one of my favorite restaurants. Our expectations were definitely not met for our early dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a handful of times as it is a quick drive with many food choices. Let me first start by saying the food is delicious! There's truly not a bad seat in this restaurant both inside and out. The waits on weekends are long, I truly prefer to go during the week to avoid the big crowds but it shows how great the food is. I am a big fan of their salads as well as drink selection. Whether you're looking for a family dinner, birthday celebration or nice lunch outside this place is great."}
{"text":"::Service was terrible right from the beginning.  We waited over 15 mins to sit down (mind you, it was NOT BUSY), then waited for water && bread for another 15 mins.  I actually had to tell not one, but two managers the wait time on water. Food took way too long to come Out and 2 other tables that came in after us was served their food first.

My husband was a.manager for a few years at the San Diego. CAli Cheesecake Factory && he even said that tops should take no more than 2 mins to get drinks n bread out.  Also, nothing was compensated at the end of the night. I Don't ever expect anything for free, but normally managers would do that for customers who  Are unhappy with service or at least cover dessert.  

The whole experience was terrible from the sit down to paying the bill.  Wait, wait, wait forever for anything!::

DON'T MESS WITH A 32 WEEK PREGNANT LADY && HER FOOD. 

Okay, my rant is done.  Would still eat at Cheesecake because of the food, BUT NEVER AGAIN at this one at Caesars Palace .. The forum ..**Thumbs down!** in Rick James Voice!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was very good, I really like their diverse menu choices and atmosphere.  The location is nice as well.
However, attention to detail in service and meals is were this Cheese Cake Factory falls short sometimes.
Today experience;

-mashed potatoes were cold on the plate while other items hot
-hostess, server, food runner or somebody should have cleared the extra 3 settings at our table (plates, napkins, 12 pieces of silverware) prior to finishing our meals. Preferable when seated or shortly afterwards, the norm in most restaurants. 

Previous experience;
-foreign inedible non food items should not end up disguised in the meal ( spit out 5-6 dime sized pieces of cardboard from a Hibachi Steak dinner from a previous visit)

Most of my experience with this location have been great.  Yeah, I will be back."}
{"text":"Bought a whole original cheesecake for takeout. It was so delicious but waited for more than 20min after I paid, which was unexpected since there was no one in front of me. But still delicious and worth it! Suggest going during work hours."}
{"text":"to name a few of my faves: avocado spring rolls, pasta da vinci with sundried tomatoes, chicken bellagio, pasta carbonara, bbq ranch chicken salad, original cheesecake."}
{"text":"We Only had 30 min and in that 30 min we had the most delicious appetizer, dinner and desert I've had in a long time. Will definite be visiting this place again! FYI: Try the avocado roll wrap thing a ma bobbers."}
{"text":"I love the food at cheesecake factory. I can't go there often though because they don't have organic non chemicalized products. If they had non GMO chicken and organic salads i would be back. But because like most restaurants they use the GMO foods now, i have to prepare my own foods at home. Look up GMO. Cheesecake factory should offer a non GMO menu for people who would pay a little less for food that is healthy."}
{"text":"I arrived at 6:30ish on a Monday night a week after they opened. I was greeted immediately and said it would be 15 to 20 minutes. 10 minutes later I was seated and my waiter was very helpful with suggestions. The menu is HUGE. I ordered a cucumber lemonade. It was wonderful. The waiter suggested the ahi tuna carpaccio rather than the crab cakes for the starter. It was fresh and came drizzled with Aioli and fresh avocado. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it was delicious and was a HUGE portion. I took home half of my dinner and had them pack up a slice of salted caramel cheesecake, which I am enjoying as I am writing this!
A very welcome addition to Madison's restaurant scene. Unlike another recently reviewed chain restaurant that opened in Hilldale. Are you listening, Cafe' Hollander???"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11am to put our name in, this turned out to be the best time to arrive. We we're the first in line at the booth opposite to the doors. We we're told she was talking names for 11:40am then she gave us a beeper to let us know when to come back. Turns out the beeper works while you shop you just can't go too far. We ended up going to dynamite shopping then came back in time for 11:40am. We got brought into the actual front of the restaurant where we were told to wait for your name, we waited maybe 5 mins then we sat down. The service was great, food came out fast and was delicious! Our waitress was going on break at one point, she came over to let us know and to introduce us to the woman who was covering for her, that's never happened at a restaurant for me, usually they just disappear. 10 out of 10 would come back! Just like the ones in the states."}
{"text":"Great food and open late. Unlike bubba Gump, CF knows that people are at Disneyland and may want food after the park. Good job. Shrimp scampi was wonderful.

{"text":"Fourth trip 
4/15/17 Still excellent and a great go~to place for a casual dinner. My go-to dish is one of their hamburgers.  It comes with a cone of fries, and they are right out of the fryer and properly salty.



Third trip. 
11/12/2015. This is a four restaurant despite being a chain.  The food is still delicious. The waitstaff was perfect and the ambiance is very soothing.  All in all Cheesecake Factory delivers a great meal."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and served quickly, which was a big deal since the restaurant was packed! It's a lively atmosphere with dim lighting but definitely a fun place to celebrate with friends.

Our waitress was especially helpful when she recommended we order our cheesecake during the meal since the high demand for cake was causing a 20 minute delay.

Plan to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour since reservations cannot be made. It would be wonderful if the restaurant would text customers when their table is ready since the buzzers don't work outside the restaurant and some people prefer to shop in the mall while waiting."}
{"text":"Was excited to get a table here finally during Victoria day. We were seated right away even thought the restaurant looked quite busy. The service was not bad. The girl at the front was rude but our actual server was extremely nice. She was on top of refills when needed, which is nice since it was a hot day.

We ordered small things, like the fried cheese sticks, southern fried crispy chicken sliders and the Nashville hot chicken nuggets. My husband said the sliders were good, they were pretty tasty. One thing I noticed is they put the lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on the side so you can assemble your own slider. My Nashville hot chicken was alright. It wasn't true Nashville hot chicken but I appreciate that effort of trying. I'm just glad it wasn't just Franks red hot sauce. The fried cheese was delicious! I would order it again. 

Now on to the dessert because thats why everyone comes here right? I ordered the cookie dough cheesecake and it was very rich and delicious. It was to sweet near the end and I was unable to finish it though. My husband ordered the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. He said it was very refreshing, tasty and tart.

All in all, I would come here again. I found the bill to be a little on the pricey side for the food but you mostly come here to try the different cheesecakes anyways."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory takes them to the next level. The atmosphere is festive and upscale. Despite the size of the restaurant, it's actually a really nice place to have a romantic dinner with your sweetie. My fiance and I like to go here to celebrate special events like our anniversary or our birthdays. We don't go here on a regular basis because it's a bit pricey. The food is really delicious, though. The avocado spring rolls are my favorite."}
{"text":"I have been to the cheesecake factory all around the united states, and this was my first time going to the restaurant in Canada. Everyone hyped up the restaurant so much however i don't think it deserves all the positivity it had gotten. I had gone with my friend (two teenagers), the wait was normal they told us 70 minutes and a table was ready within 50 minutes, which is normal for the cheesecake factory. However once we got seated was when the problems began. Our waiter didn't come to our table for 10  minutes and then didn't come back for another 10 to take our order. 

We ordered our food with no cilantro, after a 40 minute wait our meals came at the same time as our appetizers which was unacceptable. On top of that the table beside us that sat down after us and was done their meal before we even got our food. 

When our food came it had cilantro on it and when we asked for our waiter she once again didn't come, so we proceeded to ask for the manager who came immediately and dealt with the issue of our cilantro allergy and our food being delayed. 

After all of this we wanted to get out of the restaurant as fast as we could as we wasted enough tim sitting around in this establishment. Our waiter once again disappeared so we couldn't get our bill to leave the restaurant.

The quality of the food was the same as i have previously had in the united states and i believe the menu was also the same. In terms of the cheesecake wouldn't know as we didn't have but the Chinese chicken salad and the chicken pot stickers were just the same as I've had before. 

Overall the food quality was good however the service was way under expectation. I don't plan on coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Updated:
Tried again. Showed up at 11:30AM (opening). Lined up for a buzzer. Told it would be a 70 minute wait when I got the buzzer. After 70 minutes, asked for an update. Told it would be another 40 minutes at least. 210 minutes is 2 hours, at opening on a weekday! Not worth the wait for expensive pub fare. It's not like the food is gourmet. It's cheap burgers, pastas, mac&cheese things etc. Big deal.

Old review: 
Cons:
- Lined up at 2pm on Sat. Dec 2. Was seated at 5pm. 3 hrs. And that was there slow time! 
- At 6pm, we hadn't even received all our food and were told to vacate our table of 6 to let others waiting in line for over 4 hrs. to sit. Wtf?! We didn't even have all our food yet?
- Not worth the average 3-5 hr wait. 

Pros:
- Not worth the $120 per couple average for simple American pub fair. Oh wait, that's a con. 

There were no pros.

They even skipped doing the birthday song and the little desert. Not a good place."}
{"text":"OOOOOOOah!  What a great experience.  So many options, unusual options on the menu, servers galore and looking up to the ceiling and across the restaurant you get such wild ambiance.  Kids and adults enjoy the atmosphere and loud children cannot be heard more than two tables away because the Cheesecake Factory hums.

Your menu is a spiral-bound book.  Take your time and get lost in the offerings.  

Beware the \"skinny\" options.  Yes, they are low calorie and low fat, but to me they are so lacking in flavor and substance that one would have to be on a very strict diet to be subjected to the skinny life.  

Otherwise, far from the skinny life are many wonderful salads, sandwiches and entrees.  Iced tea is endless and refills are prompt.  The bread is crusty and warm.  I especially liked their soups with the bread.

You will be full when you depart as the portions are generous.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm giving only four stars as this restaurant varies time to time with experience. But this experience was excellent, mostly in part due to our waiter Joe P. 
From the beginning he was excellent with giving my daughter paper to go with crayons I brought (they don't give kids any), to giving advice on what to order based on the selections I was choosing between. He was quite attentive keeping our cups full and asking if we needed anything. He even brought the cheesecake in to go boxes as we weren't eating more than a few bites! 
Then the food was better than usual, not sure if choices or chef of the day but food was good. I had BBQ chicken salad which is my fave at a competing restaurant, I liked it better here! He had some kind of chicken and shrimp in a warm PB sauce (I can't remember name) and he loved it. Then I don't like cheesecake but I eat the Adams peanut butter usually, Joe reccommended the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was decadent! He had red velvet as his fave! 
The best part was the managers or owners or something were meeting with the chefs across from us and they kept saying how cute and wonderful my daughter is. That is the truth! Lol!"}
{"text":"If you have any type of food allergy or celiac disease be Very careful when you eat here!! I let the waitress know I have a gluten allergy and ordered a gluten free pasta. I immediately became ill from this \"gluten free\" meal! I was too sick to say anything at the time so I called the next day and spoke with a manager. His response was very unconcerned and told me nobody else called to report getting sick. It sounded like he felt this was a food poisoning phone call not someone his staff got very sick. There was no type of compensation offered for their horrible mistake. He also told me how hundreds of people a day order gluten free food and some are for allergies and some are preference. This shouldn't be a reason why my order was not given the proper care! I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Feeling kind of ill, one of my Scottsdale besties swings over to get me out of my funk for a what...a piece of sweet??? UMMM ... I dont do sweets...and I usually do no chains... but.. because my uppity bestie was in the ying for a slice of cheesecake in my neck of the woods.. we went for the factory of all things...cheesecake. Seriously, Ive been to a Cheesecake Factory for birthday parties... or in malls. But I had to rate this place, bc the waiter was off the charts one of the best I have ever, yep! ever had... I told him I didnt have much of an appetite, as I mulled the book of a menu over and over and kept sending him away and my 'wanting only dessert friend' now wanted some orange chicken too... and bread...and a side salad.. geesh.. how can a 90lb girl want so much food? ... I ended up with a chicken sandwiche and soup... none of which was earth shattering... but I loved the waiter... we had fun with the fact that the seemingly 'we never get out much' peeps next to us didnt know how to act in a restaurant...and he brought us a piece of decadent red velvet cheese cake and even wrote in cursive a cute little note for me and my friend.. and I will leave it at that:-) Score for the factory.. compliments of the waiter... Now if they can find a way to control the other diners and the out of control kids.. they may be on to something."}
{"text":"My wife and I hadnt been to the CF in along time, so today we decided to stop in for lunch.  Our experience was sub-par in multiple areas.  It started off great as we were sat quickly in the bar area, and promptly greeted by our server Nancy.  We ordered a water and an Iced Tea (Black).  The tea was excellent, which is often not the case at restaurants.  We started off with the Fried Mac and Cheese.  We had enjoyed this before and were not disappointed as we munched away on that and the free bread.  Slowly, but surely everything went downhill from that point.  Nancy, began to fade in and out of the afternoon, barely sayign another sentence to us until we asked for our check.  I rodered the Chicken nachos, which arrived first with no Chicken, no Guacamole, No Picio and No Sour Cream.  2 Minutes later my wife's Chop Salad arrived.  It was drenched in dressing and she only ate about 1/5th of the offering.  10 minutes later my nachos arrived correct, except you could tell they were the same nachos (now 10 minutes older) withgreasy chicken and toppings on it.  It was not a very great dish to begin with, it looked like it had been put together by a 14year old after school in their parent's kitchen.  Overall, the entire meal has put my wife and I off this restaurant, and I sincerely doubt we will return."}
{"text":"My wife really wanted to go to the first Canadian location of this American fixture. 

First off, come early.  The wait is broken up in to two groups.  The main wait line of 2-3 hours and the small group of 15-20 they bring over to wait (see 25 minutes) to be seated.  

So we opted for the take out which took 30 minutes    If you are here for cheesecake you can duck into the store ahead of the que.  

My wife had coconut Thai chicken.  She thought it was amazing.  My daughter had the teriyaki chicken.  She liked it in spite of the fact the chicken came in one piece and was a bit tough.  That was my assessment of the piece.  I had the white chicken chilli.  I found they use far too much pepper and the flavour was over whelmed. 

Now the real treat the cheese cake. 

My daughter had the red velvet 
My spouse had the salted caramel 
I had Dan's peanut butter fudge ripple

The rating was 5/5 for the daughter and the wife.  I found both to be very rich and smooth. 

As for mine?  As far as I am concerned it is worth the traffic, parking chaos and the crush of people to have this piece of heaven.  Fabulous!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory location. I typically try hard to avoid restaurants in shopping malls. But today, I figured life is short so wanted to give it a go to expand my horizons.  We enjoyed it pretty well. 

This location is in West Town Mall. It faces the parking lot so there is plenty of parking and big signs to identify and where to enter the restaurant.  I was surprised at how beautiful the restaurant is. It is upscale'ish with white linens but casual. They have outdoor seating, a very nice bar area and a variety of different types of tables.

We were greeted and seated promptly by our hostess and our waitress followed close behind. We were there for lunch and the menu given to us was  large and extensive.  Nice! Another nice touch was a basket of warm sourdough and whole wheat bread which came out with our drink order. 

Being my first visit, and still being on a quest for the best burger in town, I had to order their standard cheeseburger and fries as a litmus test.  Dining partner had a Cuban sandwich. Frankly, I was not expecting much figuring everything must come out of the back of a Sysco truck. But I was pleasantly surprised.

My burger seem to be hand formed, was cooked to my requested medium doneness, and served on a sourdough baguette with grilled onions and tomato.  The beef could have been seasoned more but it did taste fresh. The onions were cooked perfectly and the sourdough bread toasted just right. The fries were very good as well.  All told, it was pretty good.  

I am told that the Cuban sandwich was also very good, with the pickle within it being of particular mention. 

For the prices, our entrées were smaller than would be expected. 

We had to try a piece of cheesecake. As expected, their cheesecake selection is extensive. We went with the banana cream cheesecake which was also very good. (Note - - they have a bakery area where you can purchase baked goods to go).  A nicely sliced banana garnished the cheesecake. I was impressed that the banana was perfectly sliced and perfectly ripe. Neither over nor underripe.  I give them credit for that attention to detail. Good for them! It is appreciated. 

Our lunch entrées were about $13 each.  Little high for a burger and sandwich here in Madison. Although the food quality was strong, I'm not convinced it was quite proportionate to the cost per Madison standards. For our entrées, one slice of cheesecake and one soft drink, our bill was about $40, before tax and tip.

The space is beautiful, clean, with friendly and helpful staff.  For me, a nice place to bring my mom or grandma for lunch or if I was from out of town and needed a safe and solid bet for good food in a relaxed but upscale'ish setting. 

As mentioned, I don't expect much from restaurants in shopping malls. But today I was pleasantly surprised and I'm indeed  better for it.  Now that I'm on a roll, on to The Red Lobster (ahem)!  

For what it is, a strong Yelp four stars. See you there!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and was greeted by a very nice bartender, Zachary.ordered a beer & a flatbread as my meal. Delicious as Always. Had a great conversation w/ Zachary talking about Cheesecake Factory in Hawaii. :)took home 2 slices of delicious cheesecake that I forgot to take a pic of one of them, Oreo flavor, mine carrot cheesecake :-)"}
{"text":"Burnt appetizers. 45 minutes wait for 3 dishes which came out wrong, at different times so we could not eat together. Thirsty. Rude manager who made us pay for food that had to be remade. Free cheesecake offered for our horrible experience. Will never come to this location."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely shoddy. You had to wait for you server and ask for everything twice or thrice.  Basic etiquette was not provided by our sever. This is probably the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I have had. 

The rest rooms were also not serviced well. My wife and daughter complained that there was no toilet paper in the stalls and other patrons were doing their best to clean the stalls so that they could go"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at The Factory.  Be forewarned that the menu is quite extensive so you'll spend lots of time looking through the pages. That being said, there is something to be found for everyone. Also, be prepared for a long wait to be seated. On this trip the wait was just under an hour but at times the wait has been closer to 2 hours. But the wait is always worth it. 

My6 husband and I tried the buffalo blasts for an appetizer and OMG! Amazing.  They are crispy fried wontons filled with shredded chicken, cheese, and buffalo sauce served with a side of buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. One word:YUM! A must have anytime you're at the factory. The drinks from the bar were great.  I had the Georgia Peach and my husband had an LIT. Both were good sizes and very generous with the alcohol.  For the main course I had the New Orleans Chicken Pasta and it was amazingly delicious. The plate was ginormous so I had way more than half leftover. My husband had the Steak Diane and it was to die for. Perfectly seasoned, juicy,  and cooked to perfection. For dessert i had my normal, Carrot Cake Cheesecake which was not as good as normal (a bit too heavy tonight) but the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake that my husband had was amazing. it tastes just like vanilla bean ice cream. 

Our server Will, was awesome and all the wait staff seemed very personable.   I love The Factory and recommend it often. This one did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was amazing. It's always good here and we been here a few times. But today, the service wasn't that great. 

Our server was Jessica F. She had no personality, no greeting and didn't smile. We had to keep asking her for refills, asked for bread, extra plates etc. after a few times it started to get ridiculous. 

My family and I will be back, but we'll make sure not to get seated in her section."}
{"text":"Black Friday. The check in host was fabulous while as expected the lunch time wait and crowd on Black Friday was Crazy however she did a great job.
The fresh guacamole was NOT so fresh, it was brown.
The pot stickers seemed a little burnt and not in consistent with the one at Summerlin's Cheesecake Factory. 
Our waiter was sweating you could see it on his forehead. He seemed overwhelmed which made us not want to ask for anything however we did ask for more bread which he forgot about and we never rec'd. We were overcharged on our bill for wine. 
Last year we came at the same time Black Friday and the food, service whole experience was perfect! Don't know what happened this year."}
{"text":"The service today was horrible. I called 20 mins before arriving to order a whole cheesecake for my family. Being told it would be ready when I arrived, I expected to walk in and out. I payed immediately after arriving and was told it would be ready in just a few minutes. Then over 30 mins later while my 4 year old, 3 month old twins, and husband waited in the car  I finally got the cheesecake I ordered. What made it worse was seeing the person that was \"supposed\" to be preparing it walk around and talk to people. Next time I'll find another place to order from...."}
{"text":"Went to get dessert with six friends. The wait was supposed to be 30 minutes. Waited for 40 then went to find out only to be told I was on the list. Then the hostess claimed to have buzzed us, which never happened. Service sucks. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"What a HUGE disappointment!!!  I would never go back to this place for anything other than cheesecake!  Their food is absolutely pathetic!  And I sincerely mean that!  I don't believe people even know what \"good food\" is anymore.  And clearly the manager that was working 6/25/14 @ 1:00 pm, doesn't have a clue!!!  We ordered Fish Taco's & a Beef Sandwich similar to an philly cheese steak.  I kid you not....the taco's had ONE piece of fish in each taco the size of a nickel!  The rest of the taco was shredded cabbage!  The rice sat under a heatlamp so long that it was like biting into uncooked rice!  The sandwich that I ordered was beyond disgusting!  I ordered it without onion's.  When sandwich came it was loaded with onions....so I sent it back.  As well as the pathetic excuse of a fish taco!  Finally the incompetent waitress brought back the sandwich....and it literally had a cold piece of cheese in the roll....with cold raw fatty beef on 2/3's of the roll....and the other 1/3 of the sandwich was bare with nothing in it!!!!!  I couldn't believe they would serve this!  I called the manager over and he said \"Well that's how much meat we use and usually the onions bulk the sandwich up.\"  I wanted to backhand this fool!  You serve me cold, raw, fatty beef on 2/3's of a sub roll with cold non-melted cheese and think that's acceptable????  He said well I can get you something else.  At this point I said no thanks....you can keep it....we're leaving!  He said \"what about your taco's we're re-making?\"  I said ....Keep those too!!!!  He says...\"the waitress feels really bad....she really does.\"  The truth is....I could care less how the incompetent waitress feels!!!!!  I'm the one that feels bad here bud!  I just waited 45 minutes for food that I wouldn't give to my dog!!!!  Wow....this manager is in the wrong business!  And that waitress wasn't any better!  This place has NO STANDARDS for their food!  So do yourself a huge favor and go elsewhere!  I ended up going across the street to Capriottis and ordered a philly cheesesteak and it was great compared to the sandwich The Cheesecake Factory attempted to serve me for $13.95!!!!!  What a joke!  Ugh!"}
{"text":"I ordered a plate with salmon the plate came out the salmon was raw sent it back and they re-cooked the same piece of fish, I knew this because the big piece I cut in the middle and took a bit out of was still there ! It was now very dry a little crispy I was upset and sent it back and didn't eat dinner and it was my graduation dinner for college and my family was In town I was very upset with the situation and the manager not really doing much about the situation and not being that sorry. However they gave us two slices of cheesecake free but it was a dinner of 6 of us.

UPDATE GOT A CALL FROM THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY AND THEY TOOK CARE OF ME FOR THIS INCIDENT, therefor this being my first bad experience they deserve a 5?"}
{"text":"We decided to load up on the carbs before a big (shopping mall) run.   Everything we had was up to par for what Cheesecake Factory is known for:  good pasta and great cheesecake.

My wife and I split a chicken piccata with angel hair pasta.   The dinner portion was enough to feed us both.  The lemony sauce mixed with the capers brought a nice zest to the buttery noodles and the tender chicken  provided our delicious protein requirements.  This is our go-to dish for Italian and it's done pretty well here.

The side of little crab cake bites and ahi tuna tartare we also ordered were fairly good as well.  As was the marinara bow-tie pasta my daughter ordered.

Dessert was great.  One giant Fresh Strawberry cheesecake to feed two adults and two small kids.  

Service was fairly prompt, only slow once when awaiting for our check.   Prices were reasonable and by far this is one of the better options for dinner around the outlet mall."}
{"text":"The decor is enough to put you off your meal - the ceiling something like a 1920 musical theater, the rest of it looks like a trapper-keeper from '84 just sort of exploded all over. The chairs are like wicker outside furniture. Tables were small, close together. Sound carried, loud, but very friendly staff. 

The menu (physical) actually had ads for clothing in it. The menu items were all WILDLY unhealthy - but titled things like \"Ultra-Lean Low Fat Fried Lard: Ultra-lean lard on Focaccia with pesto and cilantro, with a side of low fat chili-cheese-chocolate fries. Mix it up with Fat-burning stout beer and whipped cream.\" 

I swear to bog, the words fat-free and low-fat were in every item description. 

Who is their target audience? Rich fat women? Ugh. Never going pack there. Certainly don't go on any psychedelics. Or do. Maybe that would help."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Our office has gone there numerous times in the past and recently went back after not being there for about a year. The quality has definitely gone down. 2 of the entrees were sent back, my fish tacos were very sparse with no flavor,and the slices of cheesecake that we ordered had gotten alot smaller than they used to be. I don't think our office will be going back there.The only really good thing was our server."}
{"text":"I ordered spinach dip & chicken Thai wraps for appetizers they were both delicious. I also ordered the Louisiana pasta and it was not good.  The pasta tasted raw. It was hard I didn't end up eating it. For dessert I had red velvet cheesecake and it was good. If only the pasta was better. The waiter was nice and gave us complementary bread and butter. Will definitely be back for the Thai chicken wraps."}
{"text":"Kobe Burger sucked, was over cooked water past well done. Dry and no flavor, ask for mayo to choke it down. 2 stars because my server was so nice. I would have paid for the meal but she took it off the bill. Cheesecake Factory is a high priced Applebees."}
{"text":"a bowl of strawberries is $8. 
eight dollars. 
i could pick those outta the ground for free

edit: it switched out my caps. 
just know my review was in caps"}
{"text":"From food to staff to that insanely delicious cheesecake, this place lives up to its reputation. 

I highly recommend it. But go early, especially on the weekends. Popularity brings long wait times. But it's worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of chain restaurants but my friend convinced me to go and since I developed a bit of a sweet tooth figured I would have a slice of cheesecake. I have to admit, it was not bad. First of all, I love the Kierland shopping area. Nothing beats it in AZ for outdoor shopping. Even though I was not really hungry, I ended up ordering some dinner and then cheesecake. (not much for not being hungry, eh?) I was enticed to order dinner because of their \"special menu\" which was a bit lower priced and only one page. I do not enjoy their novel sized menu so a one sheet menu made finding something sounding tasty easy to find. I typically only order food that I cannot make at home, but tonight I went with the mashed red potatoes, broccoli and chicken cutlet dinner. Not bad and tasted about how I would make it at home, haha. But, let me tell you about the cheesecake I had. The red velvet cheesecake cake. WOW. If you like red velvet cake, and I mean real red velvet cake, not just red dyed cake, you have to eat this. That was by far the most impressive thing I ate here. The food overall is decent and flavorful. Service decent. I would NOT want to wear those all white uniforms to work though! No complaints."}
{"text":"Pay for the food not the service, absolutely horrible.  As any Cheesecake Factory restaurants, food is great. The service here is horrible. Waiter was annoyed at our presence. Servers who brought our food knocked over utensils without an apology or bringing back clean ones. Bus person cleared plated as I had food in my mouth. Would visit again only for the food. waiters, don't expect a tip next time"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory, tried it a few times bc of friends wanting to eat there. And it's all been the same, I am not hard to please whatsoever but I would of rather gone to Dairy Queen to get a meal and dessert. Money doesnt matter to me but quality of a meal does the last experience will be my last one. Went there with a date ordered two appetizers calamari was perfect but the crab bites was horrible. Ordered two alcoholic drinks one of which was a mint mojito never had anyone butchered the drink that much it was awful. After waiting an hour after finishing our appetizers our food still wasn't out yet nor was the server anywhere to be found, it being not busy and also a Monday night we didnt understand why it was taking so long, finally the manager came over and told us that our food was accidentally sent to another table, understandable we was patient and said its ok 10 mins later someone other than the server brought the food over to our table and it was not what we ordered. Not touching the food we waited a while til the server came to check on us told her the issue she took the plates away and returned with our order, I'm guessing my food was sitting under the warmer in the kitchen for a while bc my steak Dianne was over cooked and dry when I ordered it rare, and the salmon was fishy and cold. The only thing that was truly acceptable was the cheese cake I guess if they messed that up they shouldn't be called the cheese cake factory! I will not be returning anytime soon and I won't be recomending it to anyone considering it was 120 bucks for two people and the food was awful like the service!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday for lunch, it was super busy. Our server was a gem, super cheery and helpful with a smile as big as Wyoming. The food is mediocre at best and has no depth of taste. 

I had the veggie burger made out of various ingredients, but the main taste was of farro and mushrooms. Honestly it was extremely bland and the only thing that kind of saved the meal was the side salad, which was pretty good. 

The fresh baked bread from the beginning of the meal was pretty good, but it took forever to come to our table.

Decided to get the Oreo dream cheesecake after our meal. It was so huge, we couldn't even finish it. A mound of chocolate icing on top, but again the flavor was lacking. All we could taste was sugar, no chocolate, no cheesecake, no Oreo, just plain sugar overdose. We left almost half of the slice because it was so lacking.

I wouldn't come back to any of these (not about the location) again. The food isn't worth the price and will make you feel heavy and overly full. I don't understand why these restaurants are so popular."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Matthew J. wait, ask for him he's excellent! We had the carbonara, penne shrimp and sausage, lunch portions were huge and delicious. Be sure and order the spring loaded Caesar salad, hee hee it jumps out  of the bowl it's so full. Having strawberry shortcake for desert. Isagenix cleanse here we come. Lol"}
{"text":"Went last second on a busy Saturday night , party of 8 and bday for the 15yr old favorite spot . Last second we didn't know what to expect . We were told 2hr wait at 7pm arrival. So we gave name and walked the shops .. 20 min later we get phone call table ready in 5 min .. Wow great job. We immediately head back.. Waiter was great and attentive to all details of are party and age group ordering . Was a great night . Food was on point , appetizers properly timed and drinks were always full. Even had cheesecake to go! Nuts and creme offered . They nailed it in every way. So glad we left name and number and took the chance of them calling early. Great job ! We will be back. Waiter even hooked me up with a nice glass of cold milk!!"}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but you really can't go wrong with Cheesecake factory. They have such an extensive menu, there is always something for you. Probably one of the most reliable chains out there. No matter what city you're in, you can always count on Cheesecake factory to negotiate with you."}
{"text":";TLDR stop being a repulsive hipster, set your expectations straight, ride the line, try it out and have fun. Chances are you'll enjoy it and see for yourself that this place is so successful because of the food and the service. 

Review:
Yeah the wait lines are long, and it's not a Michelin starred restaurant, but given the price and what it sets out to be, meaning a family friendly chain of restaurants for the masses, the Cheesecake Factory excels at what it does, and it's really in a class of its own. 

The stuffed mushroom appetizer is to die for. The cheeseburger spring roll is really fun. The four cheese pasta is incredibly tasty and for once the pasta is indeed al dente. The chicken Madeira is spectacular and of course, you ought to try their cheesecake. So far, the white chocolate and raspberry one is my favorite.

However, what impressed me even more than the food was the service. Our order of California Cheesesteak was way too salty, and we had to send it back. I guess there was a screw up somewhere because it was inedible. At once the waiter told us she would alert the head chef. The manager came and confirmed that something was off and apologized right away. In no time they had redone the order (which was magnificent), and they even offered a cheesecake on the house as an apology. The response to our complaint was impeccable, and it should be the benchmark against which other big chains should be measured. 

Even better, they took the kids menu right away and brought them quickly. The waiters (Jonathan and Crystal) were attentive to our kids and turned the whole thing into a great experience for them. I mean the place is packed. It's probably the busiest restaurant in town right now, and yet they took great care of us. That's probably worth more than the fantastic? food itself."}
{"text":"Stop in after running errands. Sat at the bar area, first time. Bartender name was: Ariel. Even though she was busy we had a chance to have a great conversations. She is a sweetheart! Hope to have her again serve me :)"}
{"text":"Why even bother to have curbside pick up?  If it takes 20minutes for you to get your order delivered at your car! And you ordered a one slice of cake? Very displeased.  Cheesecake Factory please do better."}
{"text":"Im going to update my review because I have had a few more visits under my belt. Dinner is definitely overpriced. And the menu is too long. They should focus on a smaller variety of foods. Entrees arent consistent. On my last visit my boyfriends dinner came out ten minutes after the rest of the table. The waiter didn't come back to check on him, and since someone else was taking care of our table for the first half of the dining experience, his food had cheese on it even though he asked for no cheese upon ordering. He needed more sauce, as his pasta was dry. Nobody to be found until everyone was finished eating. Too late to ask. A quick and insincere apology for the missing entre. Nothing taken off the bill, nothing else  offered. I always get the same thing, thai lettuce wraps. My chicken was tough and overcooked. A little dissapointed as this is my favorite dish ever. My moms favorite dish came out tasting funny. (Too tomato-y? Or maybe it didnt have enough tomato flavor? I dont remember but my sister got the same thing and said it tasted different as well). We ordered three cheesecakes which were fantastic as always. This is obviously the best part of the meal and the only thing my family comes for. Come for the cheesecake, not the dinners!"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch or dinner, while you shopping. This is now become our routine to stop before leaving outlet"}
{"text":"It has been over a decade since I have been to the Cheesecake Factory for any type of meal.

During the early to mid 2000's, this was one of our Go To spots for a great meal and celebration.

But, with so many other alternatives now, the allure had worn off.

This particular Sunday, we were invited to attend a friend's birthday celebration. There were a dozen of us, and we were seated at a corner table amidst all the booths.

The atmosphere was as I had remembered. Airy, festive, upscale. However, perhaps due to the busyness of the place, the service was lacking in attentiveness and promptness. It took quite some time for us to get our drinks. And the refills were few and far between. We received a lot of apologies. My contention was that, quit apologizing and just be prompt next time.

Then there was the food. My wife had a pepperoni pizza, and I had the Chicken Parmigiana. Along with our meal was a side salad.

The side salad was fresh enough. But, the dressing tasted watered down, and it had an indiscernible flavor. Perhaps, it was left out, or thawed out from being refrigerated.

The pizza was underwhelming, and it was too salty for my wife's taste. Especially, the pepperoni.

Then there was my Chicken Parmigiana. The battered chicken tasted as if it had been frozen, and summarily heated. It was quite hard, and cutting through it was definitely a task! The sauce and the pasta weren't bad, but the underlying meat definitely could stand some improvement.

In spite of this all, my friend's birthday celebration was still a success. 

But, the overall experience with the food and the service most certainly detracted from what used to be a fond memory of this place."}
{"text":"One of the hottest new things on the Toronto culinary scape...the big fat Cheesecake factory. Haven't dined here yet, cuz didn't have 3 hrs to wait for a table...yes, those are the wait times for a table at this extremely high in demand joint. But did try the cakes!! 

And here's what I think about the cakes:

On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being less than ordinary, and 10 being absolutely mind blowing.

Deliciousness of the cakes: A solid 8/10

Cost of the cakes: A more than solid 10/10

Calories in a slice of their cake: 15/10

These are some really really heavy cake slices. One slice, and you're done for the evening, you probably don't even need dinner. While cheesecake factory is almost an institution, and many believe that it sets the bar. But I don't think that the really great tasting cakes, are worth the excessive price tags, and I really feel that they don't need to be THAT rich to make them delicious. Yes... its desert, yes... they are cakes, yes... they are supposed to be rich and an indulgence. So, its your choice.  

For me...not THAT mind-blowing, at least not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Hubby and wifey had the pleasure of sampling the menu prior to their actual opening, of course, sans the Porkiebun to make a date night out of it.

Cheesecake Factory boasts a HUGE menu selection. Thankfully, for the soft opening, we were given only a limited menu. For appetizer, we had the egg roll platter (avocado, salmon, crispy Cuban and tex-mex). These rolls were exquisite, especially the avo rolls. Hubby then had the Chicken Reisling (chicken breast with Reisling wine sauce served with pasta). It was ok at most, nothing to celebrate about. Wifey had the Hibachi Steak, which was definitely a 10/10 for tenderness and flavour. Would absolutely go back for this steak. It was served with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. Everything on that plate was just so delicious and complimented each other well. For dessert, hubby and wifey shared a slice of chocolate mousse cheesecake. The best thing we always loved about cheesecake factory cakes is that despite their richness, the sweetness is never overwhelming.

Overall, hubby and wifey are positive they will be repeat customers, with the Porkiebun next time. Ambiance was as expected, if you've been to other locations in the States. Side note, wifey also got to try their red sangria. It was good but just a tad too sweet. Their iced tea was not the Canadian Nestea we are used to, it was the American sweetened  iced tea (which was good). With a bottle of Stella for the hubby, the bill (with tax) came out to about $110ish. Our whole meal was complimentary in exchange for filling out a survey that the staff will review prior to their Nov 21 official opening."}
{"text":"Go to Italian for all times I hang out with my friend J in the Southside. It's simple and quick and close and the menu is large enough to cut through most cravings. I get.
This location get super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, Sunday brunch/lunch because it's super close to all the Universities and a magnet for families and groups. 

 The menu is your standard Italian and I personally like the service at this location over the North Hills Ross Park Mall version [home mall] where it's hit or miss. After you get past a possible wait it's smooth sailing, everybody pitches into the process from food running and clearing the table, refilling glasses and bringing bread. It's a machine. Awesome.

My favorite for this restaurant is the skinnylicious menu from drinks to salads and foods. I love the mix of asparagus as their go-to veggie and they even manage to sneak in a bunch of carbs in too whether some mashed potatoes [steak dish] or angel hair [shrimp-lemon with asparagus]. very good. PS: do chew your food and not engulf like I do... I completely understand how people can choke to death.

Of course get some cheesecake to go. We bought the Pecan Truffle [and a couple extra ingredients] goodness and the White chocolate Macadamian Nut. [Yum]. Just a hint - these do NOT work when you're sipping Apple Martinis. NO.

Will come again"}
{"text":"I had not eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in a good 10 years, and I've spent those years thinking the Cheesecake Factory is just a typical chain with mediocre food and a large variety of cheesecake. I was pleasantly surprised with my recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory.

Pros/cons of my experience at this Cheesecake Factory:

Pros:
-Our server named Caleb was friendly, professional and attentive.
-My salmon dish was wonderful. The salmon tasted fresh, and the dill cream sauce was excellent. The sauce ratio was perfect since it lasted the whole meal as I was able to eat every bite of my salmon, broccoli and potatoes with the sauce and still had a little extra when I was finished eating. (Well, I'm someone who could simply drink dill cream sauce ...)
-The cheesecake (we tried tiramisu and chocolate chip cookie dough) was heavenly.

Cons:
-The mushrooms with my salmon dish weren't cooked very much, and they were sort of bland. They seemed raw in texture.
-While the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake was great, the actual cookie dough chunks in the cake had an off flavor like processed cookie dough. I know the flavor of from-scratch cookie dough, and this was not it.
-Why are the calories for each slice of cheesecake typed on the menu?!

I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I can never go wrong with cheesecake factory! The menu seems endless and with so much variety. The staff has been great. Red Velvet cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"Clean, great service and the cheesecake is off the chain! The food is always fresh and cooked to perfection. I also highly recommend brunch on Sundays, the pancakes is a must have."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my son tonight. We had great service. Our server Dante was on it all nite. We got our food fast and it was delicious.  We love The Cheesecake Factory. This location is awesome and so is the staff. Yum Yum"}
{"text":"Fantastic! How can a restaurant have fish tacos, pizza and herb lemon chicken and they all rock??? Definitely a fan. Plan to spend 10-15 mins on the huge menu. So worth it. Btw brunch is amazing here."}
{"text":"Ubiquitous. Once you have been one, you've really been to them all. The brown bread is great. The wait is atrocious during peak hours or prom season. The cheesecake is good but at $8 a slice, you can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took my mom and aunt out for dinner. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad. It was good. Not a cheesecake fan, wish they had chocolate cake. Dinner was ok, my sister did not get chicken parmesan, or they just don't make it like every one else. No sauce or cheese any where on her plate. Our waiter Habib was excellent! He did offer to take her plate back but we were hungry and she would have to watch us eat and then we would have to watch her eat. Mom ordered the orange chicken, had a taste it was good. I ordered the salmon, not bad. I would recommend the host be a little nicer, someone remind her she's a hostess not a model. Check out the photos."}
{"text":"All I can say is these guys make the BEST low carb cheesecake ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I visited the Cheesecake Factory (for desserts only) on my trip to Vegas during Halloween and my girlfriend told me they had a sugar free cheesecake, which peeked my interest.  So, I ended up buying two and was hooked.  I've had several others, but none compare to the Cheesecake Factory.  This stuff is to die for, lol...  I've already been back several times in my own home town.  I'm sure the regular cheesecake is just as good if not better, but for anyone on a low carb diet or diabetic, their cheesecake is out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"???????????(????????)???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Perhaps it's not cool to like chain restaurants...and, perhaps there's a rationale to that sentiment with which I can't wholeheartedly disagree.... Still, I like this location of The Cheesecake Factory. My family eats here often, and when I join them, I usually leave well-satisfied. The service is great. The food is always delicious. And for the most part, they are very consistent at this location. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal, and I've experimented with many items on the menu. I'll most certainly return."}
{"text":"We had our first experience with Cheesecake Factory here. We ordered the spicy chicken noodle meal and it was awesome. The meal and bread was very filling and tasty. 

We washed down our meal with lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was awesome. 

Our staff was very friendly and took care of us very well. Great experience and we will visit again."}
{"text":"We stopped here for desserts on Saturday, our server Robert was very nice and polite.
The Caramel Pecan turtle and the Ultimate Red Velvet tasted just excellent.
Will be back when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time at TCF and we were not disappointed. Highlight was our decorated cheesecake wishing us a happy anniversary. Nice touch from our friendly and helpful waitress!"}
{"text":"We had a good time at the restaurant and the food was pretty good and it wasn't too loud. The service was fast and the portion size was enough for 2 meals. 
The only things I would recommend is the wait staff be more mindful of their thumbs in the food or inside the dish and reaching over and talking over patron's food. 
Also beware that their suggest gratuity prices are off- they include the taxes in the total. 
Other than that, we were seated upon arrival."}
{"text":"Im not sure why the rating is so low, but this cheesecake factory is top notch. It is located out on the fashion outlet shops off the 15 freeway, North, Charleston B. It is a high end restaurant that serves great quality food with excellent service, expect to be thrilled if you have never been here.

 Outside, there are plenty of surrounding shops for people to shop for clothes, accessories and other various products. The location is located near a corner street. You cant miss it.

 Inside, it is noisy during peak hours at about 3-6pm on a weekend. There are bathrooms located in the back and no free wifi. The decoration is like any other cheesecake factory: a yellow tinted wall with various ceiling lights. There is a cheesecake bar for people to order cheesecake at the entrance. There is a bar for alcoholic drinks as well. There are many booths and regular tables/chairs scattered all over. I have been here in the afternoon and at night. It is the same noisy environment.

 Service: very good. Me and my family member were seated in less than 3 minutes. Our server was great, fast and efficient. He had a good personality and gave us our drinks before 3 minutes. Our meal came in about 10-15 minutes with a busy crowd. The bread they give you for convenience is warm. There are two types: sourdough and a whole grain bread. 

 The prices: pretty moderate. Most of the entrees on the menu are above $10 and can go up to around $50 for their more expensive specialty items. I personally enjoyed the chicken madeira. It is their most popular chicken dish. However, I order other items on their skinnylicious menu. It is worth a look if you are wanting to cut pounds. 

 Overall, it is a good experience. The food is worth what you pay for. The environment can be noisy, service is on point and the cheesecake selections are outstanding. Great for dates, family gatherings and hangouts with friends, but don't expect anything to be on the cheap end."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice. The first time my wife had the meatloaf, and not sure if it was  the food, but she threw it up later. The second time we ordered the shepards pie... 
It should have been called
 \"salt mine pie\" 
as it was grossly overseasoned. We gave you 2 shots C.F. and there won't be a third."}
{"text":"At the moment I understand that it's busy at the moment so I will not complain about that. It just sucks that the wait time for take out is standing in line to stand in line but I'm sure it would get better. I was a little surprised by the price of a slice of cheesecake but the slice was a pretty decent size. Pretty rich taste of cheesecake"}
{"text":"There is no baby changing station in the Men's restroom. You know how very upsetting that is for a father to change their child's diaper on the dirty floor?? Why is there not a baby changing station? Yes the food service is great. The food itself is wonderful. But to not have a baby changing station in the men's restroom is very very upsetting. In fact I was livid......"}
{"text":"Food has deteriorated and service at this location isn't great. The manager has no clue what's going on in his restaurant. There are way too many choices to come back here again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Asked for bread that was never brought until the food despite reminders. Dinner orders were incorrect for 3 orders. Food was cold and by the time it was brought others in the party were done. No apologies nor explanations. I'm usually pretty flexible but this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"This cheesecake factory location is always a hit or miss.  Sometimes the food is great but the service is average. Other times the food is horrible and the service is up to par. Then there are those time where neither can make up for the other.

In the last two times I went here I ordered the Diane steak and most recently the Margarita pizza (spelling). 
The Diane steak was super salty that I barely nibbled it. It also took about 1 hour for our food to get to our table, but the server and the manager was very apologetic.
The latest time I was here was for my best friend's birthday. The pizza was okay. It was a little drier than I'm used to, but it was fresh. The wait to from order was quick, bit the server was not up to par. We also had mentioned at several occasions that it was her birthday and the server also checked for her ID when she ordered her drink. In all honesty, it was the main reason we came here so we, plus the servers, could make her feel special on her birthday by singing her happy birthday -- but alas, our server did not do it and we left very unhappy. We even left a note saying the same thing to the server on the back of the receipt.

Hopefully next time it will be a better experience."}
{"text":"my first visit i must say was an enjoyable experience the front house staff  was friendly we went to sit in the bar but the stools at the high top looked uncomfortable so we decided to sit in the restaurant. we went all small plate selections crab balls very good chicken and mushrooms lettuce  wraps, mini corn dog tasty and sausage and cheese flat bread boring could defiantly have a little more pizazz , and best dish was our cute little gal wait person friendly smiling and a snappy server, i forgot her name damn it"}
{"text":"Noah was our waiter.  He was very attentive.  He anticipated needs.  The food was delicious.  Unfortunately, my brother in law had a small piece of foil on his meatloaf.  Noah sincerely apologized and then spoke with the manager who immediately came over. He, too, was very apologetic.  Without any hesitation, they offered a new meal, but also removed his meal from the bill.
Thank you for excellent service and great food!"}
{"text":"The cheese cake factory on 505 S grand central parkway in Las vegas nevada is an excellent place to eat at the staff take excellent care of their customers 100 per cent and the food is very good too/ Bodacious"}
{"text":"It's always pretty busy because it is attached to the mall, but all in all, the service isn't bad, the food is mediocre, and the cheesecake... Well that's obviously the best part. The only bad part is, the selection is overwhelming. If you can even consider that a bad thing? 

When I go, I usually stick to a pasta dish or their meatloaf. Which is my favorite thing there. For their appetizers, I recommend the lettuce wraps. 

Expect to wait if you don't make a reservation, but if you get there early enough, or at an \"off\" hour, you won't be waiting long. (Their outdoor seating is nice)."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful food! Service with a smile and timely. Very good food, we go all the time! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We love going tot he cheesecake factory, and this one is very good. The noise level is a bit high and the last 2 visit we left with higher hopes, but that's mostly because have have tried something new each time and the last two were misses. I love the Thai lettuce wraps, and the potstickers. The Chicken Parmesan left something to be desired. Their mixed drinks are wonderful and the service is great. We can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Took my family to Cheesecake Factory last night. The food was ok ... not great but not bad. I ordered their $12 hamburger with sweet potato fries. When it was delivered the waiter told me that I had ordered a salad. Our family just laughed cause they heard me order the fries. No big deal. I told him that I would need some ketchup to put on my hamburger and at least 15 minutes passed until he came back with the ketchup and at which time he said... I'll get those sweet potato fries ordered for you. I told him to forget it as it was too late. We were already done eating and were ready to leave. I asked him for a to go container for my daughter's barely uneaten entree and again 10 minutes later I had to ask a busboy to bring one over. Our water glasses were never refilled and were totally empty after 5 minutes after we sat down.  He's lucky I left him a 10% tip (I normally tip 20 - 25%). Won't be going back to this location..."}
{"text":"I can't be too unfair here, so I will leave at 3 stars and try again another time. 

Servers were cut due to slow time (a week before xmas) around 9PM that night. Basically the service was super slow (reallllllly slow) and the food all tasted pretty bland. I had chicken parm, friend had jambalaya and also no Bueno.  Potstickers were yuck too. I don't know what was going on, maybe it was me, maybe it was them. 

Regardless, I'm going to go back and give it another shot soon!"}
{"text":"Place is unreal. The menu is more like a novel. The staff though helps breakdown and so many varieties of food. The Basin IPA was delicious as well as Mai Thai. Went in for lunch and had Calamari appetizer to start. Sauces all made in store and Calamari tender. Also did Pizza and Caesar salad. You cannot go wrong with this place. The manager Cesar checked on us multiple times and was very knowledgeable for us. Take the extra minutes to drive to this location. Very well run and professional while being casual and fun."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible experience.  Service was atrocious, and no offers to compliment or even correct the wrong cheesecake order.  It was just pathetic.  I've never walked out without paying a tab, but this was the closest I've ever come.  I wanted to kick and scream, that's how angry I was.

Add that experience to all the reviews of their food being LOADED with calories, and I can tell you I won't go to another Cheesecake Factory again.  Seriously, check out articles on Yahoo about the worst restaurant foods, and Cheesecake Factory is always on the list."}
{"text":"Second to worst dining experience of all time.

Our waitress was a little timid, which is fine, but it we shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food.  Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive, and while our friend's steak came out hot, our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature.  Sent it back to be warmed, they offered to pay for it, which is great.  Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff, and made sure everything was great. 

That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour.  We finished our meals, and 10 minutes later, had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter, and to bring us cheesecake menus.  We always get the Dulce de Leche, but they brought us terrimisu or some junk.  I gave it back to the waiter (after walking the restaurant to hunt him down) and said \"no thanks, I'll just pass on the cheesecake.\"  He looked surprised, and later said we didn't have to pay for that cheesecake.  Well I'd sure hope not!

Two hours of my life are gone.  I usually like this restaurant, but tonight's service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again, free food or not."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and still had to wait almost 1.5 hours for. I ate at the Cheesecake Factory in the U.S before and food was mediocre. The service was exceptional though. Our waiter was super friendly and always managed to check up on us even though it was super busy. We ordered the tacos and the spinach dip to share. The fish tacos were good but it was paired with rice and beans which personally didn't go well together. We ordered the salted caramel cheesecake and it was really good but super sweet. My recommendation is to order the cheesecake to go and avoid eating in the restaurant until the hype is over."}
{"text":"Always a favorite spot for the family! Tons of menu items.. all delicious and fresh... skinnylicious items and fattening ones too! Something yummy for everyone! beautifully decorated and top notch service. And cheesecake yummmmmmm! If you haven't been here... it's a must in your list to try!!!"}
{"text":"Service is terribly bad. It was really busy when me and my friend came here. As i was walking to the washroom a server who's bringing our food walks towards me, it was packed so we were like face to face both going to opposite directions and she was like \"i am going that way.\" In a rude tone as she wants me to move and get out of her way and rolled her eyes on me. I said sorry as i was taken aback but it got me so pissed off on how rude she was and because of that i lost my appetite and didn't really enjoyed the food. I was really excited to try their cheesecakes but the service just ruined it."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here... We had the avocado egg rolls and a cheese pizza... The cheese pizza was okay but the egg rolls were magnificent!"}
{"text":"Food is always good here although the service is usually good from Jeffery and Sara . Jessica was my server today and she took 15 minutes to ask for our drink , another 20 to ask if we wanted an appetizer and so on throughout the meal . she had attitude and rarely checked on us. She never brought us anything until we asked we had to interrupt her to get the things we should have been offered . overall bad experience . But will continue to come for the food and other servers ."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and great service. Great place to get together with friends and family. They also have the best cheesecake in town !! There might be a bit of a wait, as this is a favorite place to go to after shopping in the area."}

{"text":"We just stopped in to pick up dessert for a friend. Fast service, but could be friendlier. No issues, or complaints! (Maybe get some animal product free desserts...)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory! My wife and I came here on Valentine's Day, as it is one of my wife's favorite restaurants. 

They don't accept reservations, which stinks, so we had to wait a while to get a seat, but on a normal day seating is pretty quick. 

The food was delicious. And the cheesecake was incredible! Cannot come here and not get cheesecake.

The pricing is a little high, so be prepared for that.

The setting is pretty romantic, perfect place for dates!

We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I received a Cheesecake Factory gift card from work and I'm so glad we decided to use it tonight! We were served by Dan and he was so friendly and accommodating. Our drinks never ran empty and our food came out fresh and at the perfect time. I was very impressed by how Dan handled our experience even when he had a large group there for Prom. He asked all the right questions and even made sure to bring out share plates and utensils. We had a bowl of the loaded baked potato soup which was delicious and served hot without that film on top you may see. For our entree we shared the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which was so tasty! Those two items combined with the hot fresh bread filled us up. Next time, we will follow Dan's suggestion and start with dessert!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory is consistently good. All locations are pretty similar. Having been to many others, the Charlotte experience was enjoyable, same food as always, awesome warm bread to start, large portions of delicious food, not a bad wait to get a table tonight either though it is a week night. The South Park mall is also pretty nice. Much larger than expected and some trendy local stores to check out while walking off your CCF meal :-) however, if you do not park nearby and you plan to leave after 9:00pm, best to park by that exit or any mall exit because stores close and you may need to walk the outside of the mall to get to your car from there!"}
{"text":"Its The Cheescake Factory.

The place looks and smells great and you can always expect profesional service. As well as a massive menu and a gorgeous desert window

It really is all that and perhaps more.

Todays visit was a meet up with and old friend and we did enjoy our lunch in a very nice booth that was excellent for a long leisurly lunch steeped  with great conversation. 

Service was attentive and it was on me when she did her check back that I had'nt noticed the kichen forgot the chicken on my salad. By the time I saw her again I made the choice not to send my half eaten salad back for revisions. It should have been made correct, or corrected/ caught by the expo and or my  server.

The Chinese Chicken-less salad was stil tasty yet awkward to eat, and I can see why the impressivly massive, yet useless pile of fried white noodles made it next to impossible to see the chicken omission.

Cheesecake was offered and drinks to go accepted. It was a safe spot for lunch and Im sure my salad would have been corrected, but not saying anything was just easier."}
{"text":"Famous for its cheesecake and infamous for its two-hour waits, I must admit up front that I had no intention of liking this restaurant. I considered it to be over hyped and overrated; however, after a very satisfying early Saturday lunch, I now feel completely different.

We arrived at 11:00AM and were seated immediately, fortunately in Melissa's section. We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying.

For our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert. 

As an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not.

After drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good!

Hey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait.

Overall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun. And on top of everything else, it had a 96 sanitary rating. There's no way I can give it anything but five stars! And of course it is a Gotta Try!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for great food day or night hands down. They have what must be the worlds best passion iced tea ever. Well my world at least. But pretty much anything on the menu is fantastic. I love the Renee's special with the chicken salad sandwich and salad AND soup. I can barely finish this. The lemon chicken piccata is amazing. The factory burger is amazing. The Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos are great as a light meal. Oh yeah cheesecakes are great too lol but I rarely order."}
{"text":"AmaZing service, amazing food... BEST RESTAURANT EVER but only con is minimum wait time is 3 hours BUT IS WOrth it"}
{"text":"Always yummy!  I love the big menu because there is so much to choose from.  It is close to work and home so I love the carside to go.  I do wish they had more spots because they always seem filled up."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have dessert, cheese cake, of course, also great cappuccino :-)"}
{"text":"NEW menu item - Mediterranean Flatbread Sandwich. Includes lean ground beef, marinated onions, tzatziki, feta cheese on warm flatbread. Four, 3-bite pieces are just enough to leave room for a few piping hot frites which also come with this meal. $12.95 is certainly reasonable.

Highly recommend. Ask to be seated in Steven R's section. He's good.

Oh, and maybe some cheese cake for desert. I'll work that off on Camelback Mountain tomorrow."}
{"text":"Luv this restaurant!! They give free bread basket(wheat and sour dough) the wheat is the best.. I tend to eat too much of it by the time my meal comes I'm stuff.
They have the best calamari appetizer compare to all the ones I've tried.. It comes with their garlic aioli(always ask for extra cuz it's really GOOD)
My fav. Dishes are the Pasta Da Vinci, orange chicken, jambalaya and Thai Lettuce wrap( get the one on the skinny menu) cuz it comes with 3 wrap prepare for you.. If sharing w/ someone than order the regular menu cuz it's a huge portion which I could never finish..
Luv Luv their cheesecake..hehe.. Well the name say it all rt?? Pricey but good.. I usually get the fresh strawberry, banana, tiramisu cheesecake.. They have so many different flavor it's unbelievable.. For some reason I always order the same one..guess I'm loyal..LOL"}
{"text":"The food is ok you sitting elbow to elbow with the next group good desert it's a good place to bs a girl they like how the place look but the food is cheap"}
{"text":"I'm always ready for cheesecake! Mushroom burger never disappointed me my gf got four cheese pasta was delicious! John served us and he was very nice and fast! Love this place."}
{"text":"Great experience here!   Ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a gluten free bun due to an allergy.  Alejandro, our waiter was very knowledgeable, thorough and double checked everything with the manager-Robb.  They both spoke to the chef and line to make sure of no cross contamination. Ended our meal with the Godiva double chocolate cheesecake for dessert.  Alejandro and Robb, thanks for making our eating experience a one in a lifetime!  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Always enjoyable here plus Mojito's. Gonna be fish and chips tonight and thai lettuce wraps it is."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars! I dropped by a week before my visit to make sure I could use some really old gift certificates. The manager was very helpful, and said he would honor them, and gave me his card to make sure I could use them if he wasn't around. It's a shame that I didn't write down his name. 

I decided to eat there yesterday, with a friend, but it was more crowded than I expected for a Wednesday. I was told it was about a 25 minute wait, but it was really only about 15 minutes. The hosts and staff were very friendly, even though there was a crowd of customers waiting around. We were seated in a booth close to the kitchen, and if I have to think of any negative, it's that those booths were very dark, so it was hard to read the menu. That isn't enough to remove a star, though. Our server, Shawn was just awesome! He was the perfect combination of friendly and professional. I would recommend you sit at his table! I ordered the Chicken Madeira/Steak Diane combo, which was very good, and exceeded my expectations by a mile. My plate was so clean, you would have thought I licked it that way. I had the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake for dessert which was also very good. I would expect nothing less from a restaurant with cheesecake in their name. I only have a picture of my dessert, since I forgot to take one of my actual meal. 

I'm sure I will be back, even without gift certificates...haha."}
{"text":"Tourist trap! Expensive but consistently good at providing a relaxing atmosphere and food to die for. Don't forget to grab your cheesecake on the way out. Not a slice, grab a hole cake."}
{"text":"Was at the restaurant with 4 other people for a table of 5.  Had to wait over 3.5 hours for a table.  When it was finally our turn, turned the pager into the hostess and she was extremely rude.  Then the waitress who waited on our table was more rude.  Don't know what happened with her but our waitress was changed to a much better waitress.  Anyway, bottom line, would never return with extreme poor service."}
{"text":"This is our second visit because while the food was mediocre the first time,  the service was wonderful. 
This time it was my daughter's 18th birthday.  We were seated in the back corner looking at nothing,  but okay,  the hostess did not know, but there were plenty of tables in the  restaurant.  Then we had a waitress that majored in condescension.  The food was,  once again,  mediocre and the server was rude.   The two stars are for the Cheesecake which did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. It took 45 mins to get our entrees and they all came to the table separately. My entree was cold from probably sitting in the window too long. Just an awful experience. I never write reviews but I felt compelled to have to vent."}
{"text":"The food is average for the price. I would probably only go for the cheesecake next time. It is a bit pricey for what you get. The wings are not great. It was very busy so the service was slow but understandably with the crowd. It does have nice patio seating there."}
{"text":"My family was extremely pleased with our service today. When given a 45 minute to an hour wait, we were admitted after only 20. We had a great waiter named Cameron that was attentive and checked on us often. He was polite and gave good food recommendations. Our food came out fresh and delicious. I went out on a limb and got the Mac n cheese burger and it was delicious! (Picture attached). I'm definitely recommending this location to my friends."}
{"text":"If you are a captive of shopping all day at South Park mall it is certainly better than the food court and there are lots of options. However, nothing tastes as good as it sounds and the quality of food is college dorm level at premium prices. It is also incredibly slow. I wont be back and will  plan better in the future if I come to the mall with my kids."}
{"text":"As someone who used to live in the US and went to The Cheesecake Factory regularly, the new Toronto location did not disappoint. As a note, there are long lines, but this is fairly normal at all their locations. This is not a Toronto thing. The lines will probably get shorter over time, but they'll never go away. 

The entire restaurant, including the food, is exactly like the US versions. The only difference, of course, is price. They've obviously upped the prices for the Canadian dollar. 

The Yorkdale location is pretty big, but I have seen bigger Cheesecake Factory's in the US. The bar area could be a wee bigger, but it's okay. The takeout area could also use more space because it's right near the entrance where people are waiting. But the layout is otherwise fine. It is confusing, however, because they have both an outside entrance and a mall entrance. My friend and I entered via the outside entrance but had to go sign in at the mall entrance. There were no signs about this, which would have been helpful. And since the whole wait list is electronic, it doesn't make sense why people couldn't signup at either entrance. 

The food was good. The drinks a decent size, but pop is always over priced at restaurants. The food portions are massive, which is a tradition at the Cheesecake Factory. And the menu selection is massive, so be prepared to have to debate yourself over what you want. 

And the cheesecake, what can you say about perfection?! I ordered a slice of the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake for dessert but also took home a small strawberry cheesecake. The slices are an okay price, but the full sized cakes are expensive. And they should probably provide some storage instructions for take home cheesecakes. 

Overall, I would recommend a visit, at least once. If you live near there, you can easily do takeout if you don't want to wait. And you can takeout a cheesecake anytime too."}
{"text":"It was a nice run, but you have lost it and lost me forever, as a customer Cheesecake Factory.  

35 years a faithful customer but your DICK manager could care less and had a shitty attitude.

You have the nerve to cut the portions and raise prices???  Not even a quality product!!

$15.95 for for a tiny salad, that USED TO BE so big, for half the price they charge now...today their salad fills a small bowl.

I sent the chicken, avocado, mango salad back, you cut tiny tomatoes in half??? There were 3 halves.

 I could barely see any ingredients...mixed with that nasty garden greens that cost 99 cents a bag in the store.

I then order another salad that said fresh beets but they were canned, with a tablespoon of goat cheese, pithy tomato chunks, 4 in all, brown lettuce and two pecans.  THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT IT IS ALL THE  SALAD DISHES.

I sent that back so no dinner for me on Easter.

If you want to spend up to $30 each to eat here, go for it!

Never to return.

UPDATE:

Instead of offering me a complimentary meal, or calling ME, to make it right, I get a NULL: response, IN MY EMAIL, directing me to their website, WHERE they dictate, that I perform functions, to answer questions. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

JUST AN UPDATE TO LET YOU KNOW  HOW LITTLE CHEESECAKE FACTORY CARES ABOUT THEIR SHIT QUALITY OF FOOD AND MANAGEMENT."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was perfect! Had the Belgian waffle and chicken delicious. Of course the cheesecake never fails and the server was prompt and knew the job."}
{"text":"Watch out for your credit card!  Server stole my credit card and used it fraudulently.  When I called the manager, I received a very snarky sarcastic response.  I have spent hours of my time dealing with this and did not even receive an apology!  Thank goodness I am from a different state where people actually care about others."}
{"text":"The food and service was great!
The servers name is Deann D she was one of the best polite, courteous, professional gave great suggestions. when food was delivered by food runner he checked to make sure the order was correct, the server who was very busy also came by to check to make sure the order was correct. It was nice that the food tasted as good as it looked. The taste, texture and presentation were spot on. The atmosphere was great a little noisy however that's too be expected at times. 
Also spoke to manager that was on duty that evening agin polite, cretinous and happy to get our feedback.  
 We loved it.  will definitely come back. 

All this being said I wish to say to the people who gave bad reviews shame on you!  In my opinion some of you were simply trying to get a free meal. I am glad you didn't get it until you have worked in the food service business you have no right to complain. 
Just because you have had a bad day there is no reason to take it out on someone who has a very difficult job dealing with people like yourself"}

{"text":"This is your typical large-scale chain American food restaurant that wins on customer service and consistency. A bonus is the portion sizes are large enough for two meals and their amazing desserts. 

All the pasta dishes are great -- if you love bacon try the Pasta Carbonara. It's my go-to dish here for the moment. My pass favorites include Chicken Bellagio and the chicken alfredo with sun dried tomatoes. 

I've had a few sandwiches here -- the club and the cheesesteak. I don't really like the cheesesteak, it just doesn't have that delicious steak and cheese combination flavors like Corleones. However, the club is one of my favorite club sandwiches found anywhere and it's particularly good on a really hot Arizona day with an iced tea or a coke. 

The service is always great -- friendly and personable -- and they seem to have the timing down of when to check-up on the table.

One of my favorite things about the Cheesecake Factory is their hours: they are open super late for the area, 11:00PM on weekdays and 12:00AM Thursday through Saturday. 

One downside is I really don't like their alcoholic drinks. They are really strong (as in not blended right) and taste like they use super cheaper liquor. 

Oh and breakfast: not good here. I had the breakfast sandwich made with french toast and bacon. It sounded amazingly delicious but it was so gross I didn't even want to it. Something about cheese and french toast just didn't go together well for me. 

This a great place for two people or large groups. Bear in mind the noise level can be a bit loud so come later in the day if you want a quiet meal."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night around 6pm. Food was great. I had the bam bam chicken and shrimp. It's was amazing I would definitely recommend it if you like the Thai  coconut curry. Our waitress Jasmine was very good, we asked a lot of questions and asked for some recommendations and she did not let us. She kept coming back to check on us and kept our drinks filled. She her self gets a 5 star from  me. I brought back some cheese cake to out room. After the long walk back the cheese cake was just what I needed. Thank you jasmine and the Cheesecake Factory staff for make our experience enjoyable"}
{"text":"Hi Cheesecake Factory I like you but I'm not in love with your crazy wait times, or giant sized portions. Your place looks pretty cool though, I like high ceilings, and I can appreciate the sizable outdoor patio area, but can we get tables that are a bit bigger please? It's really crowded!

Adjoined to Southpark Mall is the ubiquitous Cheesecake Factory. Every time I go for a shopping spree I see tons of people waiting their turn to get into this place like an exclusive nightclub and people leaving with bags of food. So I finally decided to try it out after a shopping spree one day. The place feels very cavernous walking in with super high ceilings and some paintings to gaze at as you're looking up wondering how much their power bill costs. Well then the waiting game begins, first we checked in to the hostess station and was told there will be about 45 minutes wait which turned out to be about an hour, okay no big deal I thought. Turns out the buzzer thing they gave me was to announce that I could now wait in the shorter line to actually be seated! What a tease!

So now we're finally seated and hungry looking at the huge menu. Some bread came out I guess to sate your hunger a bit from waiting an hour+ to get a seat. I ordered a frozen mango smoothie and appetizers took that took a while to come out by this time I'm wishing they gave me some more bread. The spicy ahi tempura roll that came out is huge and delicious but not spicy at all. Then came the main courses which actually came out on time! I had ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and was totally unprepared for the size of this thing. I mean seriously it would have taken 4 meals for me to finish this thing off, it was very delicious though! The sudden influx of food at once left me feeling really bloated though so we opted for taking dessert home and bought a tiramisu cheesecake for later.

I've probably rambled on too much at this point so I'll just summarize. Come prepared to be hungry in 1-2 hours and not while you're actually hungry. Prices are a bit high for the type of food but they give you enough food for 3-4 meals. I just don't really understand this place the food is nice but I there are plenty of dining options around this area where you don't have to wait for 2 hours. If they took reservations I'd probably be here more."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good... for a chain.  It was exactly what we expect from the Cheesecake Factory.... consistent with all the other Cheesecake Factories I had been to. Don't get me wrong... my family and I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It's a guilty pleasure.... 

The things that irked me about this particular location:

1.  Parking: what a pain! luckily they had valet (which we used...awesome!) however we had a large party and one family had a baby and i KNOW they parked uber far and had to carry the infant seat and everything....

2.  Service: what a nightmare.  I don't even know our server's name.  All I remember is she was blond, and short (not in stature, but attitude-wise).  Granted we had a large party (13 people) ... uh oh... here's where i go off on a rant.




So we had a large party.  It was my (pregnant) sister-in-law's birthday. We had 3 children with us 10 adults... we all arrived within 10 minutes.  We had asked the server to wait until we were all here to start taking orders.... but she didn't feel that was a good idea.  I personally felt that we got the short end of the stick because we were a large party and she felt she did not have to give us good service because she was already getting auto-gratted.  Boo on her.  Tip karma forces my boyfriend (who picked up the tab that night) to automatically tip AT LEAST 25 percent (instead of the, what, 18 percent auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more?)

anywho, drinks came out staggered. menus came out staggered.  food came out staggered.... all because the server did not want to wait the few minutes for all of us to be seated and get situated.  rawr.

and on top of that, some rude lady in a near by booth kept shushing the 2 4-year olds with us (one being my daughter) and shooting dirty looks my way. lucky for her my parents taught me to respect my ugly... i mean elders.

That all being said (please excuse my poor grammar/run-on sentences)...

bottom line:  food was consistent with every other cheesecake factory out there (yay for avocado eggrolls and THE BEST fried mac and cheese in the world) but the service was shoddy (really though, WHY would you bring out dessert for everyone else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls wait 10 more minutes for theirs? who does that?!?) 

I'll stick to the location in Henderson, or even brave the strip and head to the Cheesecake Factory in Caesar's."}
{"text":"Worst service ever at this location!!  If you are in a hurry, stay away!  Management should learn how to service the guests.  Food takes way too long to come out!!  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We rolled up to the Cheesecake Factory at around noon. They were running at about 40 minutes wait for a table, but my family and I were lucky enough to snag bar seating. I sat down and ordered a Bloody Mary and a plate of nachos for an appetizer. When my Bloody Mary arrived, it looked (and tasted) like watered down tomato juice with a solitary celery stalk waving hello. Barely any spices were added and I almost wondered if they forgot a little something something. Strike 1. The nachos were decent. Nothing special, but passable bar food nonetheless. For my meal I ordered the \"shepherd's pie\" (though with ground beef instead of lamb it was more of a cottage pie). Lunch came out almost on top of the appetizers. Strike 2. Oh well, no biggie really. Initially, the meal looked promising with red potato skins in the mashed potatoes, julienned carrots, and parsley. Unfortunately, I was in for a nasty surprise. It turns out when the Cheesecake Factory says \"ground beef\", they really mean \"huge chunks of crumbled up hamburger patty\". I also have  a sneaking suspicion that they save the hamburger patties they really screwed up for the dubious honor of being covered with gravy and hidden in mashed potatoes. The patty used in my meal was blackened and crispy on the bottom. They tell you that activated charcoal is great for detoxification. Well, based on the hunk of carbon I just snacked on, I should be rid of any toxins I've come into contact with for the last ten years. Not delicious. Hey batter batter. He swings, he misses. Steee-rike 3 and I'm outta here."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to go to their mock service and enjoy a meal with a guest. The food was delicious. I had the steak medallions and also the BBQ chicken salad. The medallions where booked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned perfectly, the salad was huge and more than enough for two. Since it was a practice run our server was immensely nervous. We waited a while, but thankfully I had time to spare. The food did take a little while to get to us , but that can be expected in a practice service. All in all our server was attentive and pleasant. For a hundred dollar tab on them all I can say is thank you Cheesecake  Factory!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, waiter was was nice, food was okay until my husband took a bite of mushroom and found cardboard. How the heck did cardboard get into his food? The manager apologized, offered a new plate, and took off the charge for the cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Went in around 8pm for brothers graduation dinner. Restaurant was pretty dead, but our server was very slow. Took 25 minutes for our party of 5 to get a round of sodas. Upon ordering a pizza, I was informed 10 minutes later that the kitchen burned all of the pizza and flatbread dough so they couldn't make any more pizzas for the night.. great. Cheeseburger egg rolls were served without ketchup. When we were all done for the evening and asked for a to go box we patiently waited for ten minutes and finally took it upon ourselves to get up and get one. Like I said the restaurant was dead. There's no reason for the service to have been as slow as it was. Cheesecake Factory  was disappointing on a night of celebration for our family."}
{"text":"Asian lettuce tacos were amazing and the sauces to go with them were great compliments."}

We called and spoke to the manager on duty. He didn't take his name and phone number or any thing . Just said he will look into it. 
Didn't really seem to be to concerned ! We won't go there again ."}
{"text":"Perhaps I've just had a bad experience ordering a salad and a glass of iced tea.  Not a tall order.  I ordered, got my tea and bread, ran to the restroom, came back to the bus boy perusing my outlet mall shopping bag, after clearing my table.  He (max) realizes his mistake and gets a different waiter to correct things.  This I can deal with.  I get my salad... Then eventually some silverware... And a tea... And then some bread... And then my salad is missing the pecans and is drizzled with 2 unfortunate bites of goat cheese.  I politely ask for the salad to be tossed with some pecans.  But alas it returns with just a few pecans (wouldn't you think to toss in like a solid partial handful or something) and still no goat cheese.  Did the chef just look at it when it returned and say -- \"that looks like shit.. Let's serve it again like that.\"  The waitress and manager were the saving grace of this whole operation (and the reason for 3 stars).  They were extremely polite and empathetic, but I will not be coming back to this location just out of the shear complacence in the food preparation.  I hate being that guy, but when your order doesn't get fixed after you send it back, something must be said.  

Sincerely,
Unsatisfied customer: Jeff"}
{"text":"Skyler Oliver treated us perfectly. Those drinks were outstanding and the food was spot on. Unfortunately, as badly as I wanted the desert, I wanted to be able to get to my car without having to be rolled!"}
{"text":"I will admit it! I have an unhealthy obsession with the Cheesecake Factory. Yes yes, this is a chain, I know. But honestly, I don't give a flying f*** if its a chain or an independent restaurant owned by some cute little family down the road. As long as the food is delicious and plentiful, the service fast and friendly, the cost is palatable,  and the atmosphere clean and pleasant, I will be a fan of any place. After all, isn't that what writing reviews and being a foodie is about?
I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I can't think of a time when I had a non pleasant experience. Yes, there have been a couple of waiters that are a bit slower then others and some of the dishes were not as good as others, but I can always say that Cheesecake Fac is a safe bet if you want a nice meal that will fill you up along with decent service. 
If you have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know about their menu. It is literally a book! They pride themselves in having something for everyone so there are tons of items to choose from. Here are a few of my suggestions of what to order so you don't go wrong: 

Appetizers:
- Sweet corn tamale cakes
- Fried chicken sliders
- Avocado Eggrolls
- Fried Zucinni small plate - Their small plates actually have alot. They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids
- Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not, their clam chowder is the best I have ever had

Entrees:
- Chicken Costelleta
- Chicken Chipotle Pasta
- BBQ Ranch chicken salad
- Salisbury chopped steak
- Crispy spicy beef
- Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavors

Keep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion, the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. You could share one entree with another person and get an appetizer and be stuffed yet not spend alot. Now I will admit that there were some things I had at the CC Factory that were not that great. The crabcake burger is too greasy and overpowering, and their mac and cheese balls are nothing impressive. But the good far outweigh the bad and there definitely is something for everyone. Heck, if anything, there is always the cheesecake which they have in every flavor imaginable. Try the dutch apple or carrot, these are my favorites!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner yesterday with his sister, brother in law and kids. They arrived before us so they got a table and we joined later. We were surprised to see that the place was pretty full on a week day when we walked in. 
Our server handed us the menus and asked us for our drink orders and she was nice to ask if we'd like to place the kids orders ahead of our meals which we did. 
It took us a little while to go over the menu particularly me coz this was my first time here (I've been to the Dubai branch when I lived there and tried the Charlotte branch once 3 years ago but had to go over the menu again since it's pretty long and thought they must have some new items on there since the last time I was there). The first thing that I remembered when I looked at the menu was that the prices were kinda high. Even a pasta dish was at least $15 which we thought was a little too much. Nevertheless we decided to order appetizers and main dishes for everyone. Since I'm currently on a dairy-free egg-free diet, I asked for the allergy menu and they said they didn't have one. This to me was a negative because for such a big restaurant, if u don't want to have a separate allergen menu, you should at least identify allergens in ur main menu, right? Gluten, dairy, egg & nut allergies are becoming increasingly common and therefore this needs to be addressed. The waitress however said she would help me remove dairy items for my order (mind you she mentioned that \"most dishes have dairy in them however\". Any way to be on the safe side I decided to go for the old fashion burger. My husband ordered the mushroom burger and we ordered guacamole for appetizers. My sister in law and her husband decided to share a salad & the spicy chipotle chicken pasta with fried cheese as an appetizer. 
The appetizers took a while to come out so when the mains came, we were not done with our apps yet. No problem, we decided to dig in. 
My burger was very plain. Nothing special to be honest, I've had much better burgers in much cheaper restaurants around town. This feedback was also my husband's on his mushroom burger; \" nothing special\". My sister in law said their food was good, also nothing impressive. 
During our dinner, the server came to ask us if we needed any thing and she filled our water cups. She also asked us if we wanted a box for our guac since we didn't finish it and we said yes. Overall her service was pretty good. 
An underwhelming experience for both families yest. Not something we'd be willing to go back to any time soon to be honest."}

{"text":"I enjoyed their Brunch Combo. The scrambled eggs were awesome topped with their pico de gallo."}
{"text":"I was INSULTED by the general manager. What GM of a restaurant doesn't know the difference between a host and a guest? I left my credit card with my server before the meal and explained that the party of 12 were my guests. The server checked with her manager then agreed to hold my card. At the end of the meal, the general manager presented the bill to one of my guests. She was a personal friend of his and he wanted to pay. I pulled her aside to explain our agreement. Her answer was basically that he was more important to her than me. She asked me if I felt that it was fair for her to say no to her friend. I felt SO DISRESPECTED that I immediately walked out. Seeing me upset, my friend cancelled his transaction and I paid. On the bill, I gave a zero tip and wrote that they lost a 20 year customer. The GM started crying in the middle of the restaurant but also said that she doesn't care about losing customers because she has many others. She said it wasn't fair that I left no tip. Now she's crying about fairness! 
This was a place that was dear to me. We celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, and friendships there. It's unfortunate that a disrespectful person like her can so mishandle a client in favor of a friend and totally ruin our evening."}

{"text":"I've always had a good experience at Cheesecake Factory. The service has been always on point. The food is always good and tasty, just a little pricey. I don't really understand all the bad reviews. This place is always busy and you definitely have to wait on the weekend. Don't believe all the other reviews."}
{"text":"The stars are for their good service. I came here with the party of about 15 a few nights ago and was thoroughly impressed with how accommodating they were to our needs. They were quick to seat us, bring us waters and provide us with bread while we waited for the entire party to arrive. They checked back frequently for all of us to arrive and was ready and waiting to take our order when we were all present. Also, they had no problem initially separating our checks during ordering so we wouldn't have to worry about splitting the check later on. Which was GREATLY appreciated and made checking out that much easier. Now, everyone knows how overwhelming Cheesecake's book of a menu is. I didn't mind waiting for our late friends because it takes that long to decide what to order. They also have a separate \"SKINNYLICIOUS\" menu that I've never seen before! This is news to me. We are usually pretty healthy eaters but this particular night was a \"cheat\" day for us. We ordered off the regular menu: fried avocado, zucchini, and portobello mushroom starter and the avocado egg roll appetizer. They were both great. In attempt to be somewhat healthy, I ordered the almond crusted salmon kale salad on the regular menu and this dish is not good at all. I gave it a chance and took a few bites hoping that the salmon flavor would kick in or the dressing would save it but I didn't taste anything. It was very bland. I had to ask the waiter to take it back because I didn't even want to take it home. I hate doing that and wasting food but I had to and he was so nice to take it off our bill. Thank you so much, I really appreciated it. Thank goodness my fiancé ordered the salmon and steak plate because it was enough for both of us to share and the flavor profile of this dish was wonderful. The steak flavor reminded me of adobo and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I had no more room for dessert which was a bummer because I love almost every dessert I've ever tried here. But I did have the privilege of trying my friends lemon cake/strawberry cheesecake and it was SO GOOD. I will need to get it the next time I go in. I also like that Cheesecake Factory is one of the few restaurants who stays open late. I'm not big on chain restaurants but Cheesecake Factory is always a viable option in my book."}
{"text":"Normally we have a delightful time at The Cheesecake Factory at this and other locations, but this evening was a huge disappointment. We were quickly notified that our table was ready and after a short wait our waiter arrived. Once she took our drink, appetizer and entree order., things went down hill. 

She asked if we wanted water, we both said yes but it never arrived. The table on either side of us received a basket with assorted breads, but no bread was delivered to our table. Our entrees arrived before our appetizer. The entrees were lukewarm and when I asked to have them warmed up we were informed they would have to start them over. The waitress went on to say that in the meantime our appetizer should be ready. We decided not to waste our food and to cancel the appetizer. The next thing we know, she brings our appetizer out anyway. 

The next time she stopped at the table I asked if we were supposed to get bread. The waitress told me we needed to request bread. When I paused on that comment, knowing that in the past we have been offered bread without request, she responded with, \"I guess I could have offered you bread.\" When she brought our check she brought us a bag of bread to take home, even though we had already told her we did not wish to take any home, but rather would have liked it with our meal. 

I honestly don't know if she was having a bad night or what, but it was enough to get me to write this review. The food would have been good had it been warm and in the correct order. Sadly, it will be awhile before we return."}

Chicken Crusted Romano was good too! 

Great night tonight, glad we chose Cheesecake Factory tonight."}
{"text":"I can't allow myself to give a billion dollar franchise a 5 star rating, so they'll get a 4 from me. It's not like they'll lose stocks or customers over it.

Anyway, when this location opened up in the North Premium Outlets, I thought, \"this is going to be dangerous.\" I literally work about 300 ft. away, so I knew that I was going to have to practice self-control. I've placed my lunch order for pick-up here a few times now and it's been nothing but awesome.

Every time I call, the ladies on the other line are friendly. At the pick-up counter with all the chaos of other orders, the cashiers are fast and friendly. I haven't had any of my orders screwed up, so kudos to them, especially with my lunch being timed.

As for the food, everyone knows their menu is vast. If you're eating healthy or don't give a crap about heart disease, they have something for everyone. They can even alter some items to be gluten free. Portions are huge, so you can always split your meal into 2 servings. And of course, who can forget their infamous delicious cheesecakes? Oreo, lemon merengue, vanilla bean, plain, etc. The list goes on for about a page and a half on the menu. Hence, where the self-control comes into play.
 
I'm a fan and I'll definitely be back when I \"forget\" to pack my lunch:)"}
{"text":"Food is good. Waiting service is grand. Did the egg roll sampler today along with the tuna tar tar nice taste small portion. Also had the lettuce wraps which have some proper chicken. 

Now the harsh reality about this particular cheesecake compared to outlets or forum, it's too dam busy I mean WTH. The hostess staff is the wildest group of ppl I would definitely manage peoples expectations better if I were in their shoes. If your going to eat here your only options are half an hour before they close or at 2 or 3 pm at any other time of day it's a mess people all over the place just pandamonium"}

I just ordered a pizza 'without' pepperoni and they got the order twice 'with' pepperoni and said sorry we messed up and finally got me an average tasting pizza with salty fried egg plant on top of it. And for all the mess they created, they did not even have the minimum courtesy to offer a waiver on my check! Last two times I have been there, the food was terrible to eat. The dish dripped in oil and french fries were bitter! The feeling of thinking about it while writing this makes me sick! Never going back to this place nor am I recommending it to anybody else. Overall there is only a 30 percent chance that you ll end up with good food if you go to this restaurant."}

The servers looked like they should have gone home hours ago. They were dragging and mine never came back to see if everything was alright. It was not worth walking that far to dine there. Eat at another CCF where you don't have to walk a mile both ways."}
{"text":"Thank you Thank you Thank Francis for keeping the doors open for me to get that piece of cheesecake to go that I could not live without!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  It's always great.  Today we got avocado egg rolls, and the pizza/salad lunch.  I got a Cesar salad and an everything pizza and both were amazing.  The avocado egg rolls are my favorite.  Oh, and my margarita was fabulous too!  Everyone was super friendly.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"Your average Cheesecake Factory in a mall. It's super busy but the food is reliably yummy so you keep going back. Service isn't the best but they aren't rude, so it's fine with me. I usually have sandwiches for the Liz Lemon side of me. Try the ranch dressing with your fries, it's so good! We are big fans of the mango key lime cheesecake but I also can't quit my old favorite, cookie dough. It's yummy, just go."}
{"text":"First I want to say that I have got to The Cheesecake Factory in many cities across the U.S. and have always experienced the same high quality food, service, and restaurant decor.  It has always been a very pleasant experience.  Since living in LV I have frequented the one on Rampart and love the food.  The variety of menu items should satisfy anyone's desires.  My favorite lately is meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  The potatoes are real and soooo yummy!  And I love the tropical ice tea.  I have also tried he oriental chicken.  It is enough for 2 and spiced just right.  Let's not even discuss all the cheesecakes!  They are to die for !  Hope this convinces you to give it a try."}
{"text":"I love cheese cake factory! 

This one has great service always very quick  

I love their blueberry mojito"}
{"text":"There's nothing new to be said about The Cheesecake Factory itself - yes it's a big expensive chain (with advertising on every page of their menu). Granted.

Since Ross Park Mall is now revitalized with upscale stores, you're limited to the Cheesecake Factory for upscale eating (who wants to shop at Tiffany's and then go to a crowded foodcourt?), aside from the crowded cafes at Nordstroms.

During peak shopping times (Anytime on Weekends) be aware of the very long wait ahead of you - an hour, probably. It's going to be busy. However, the vibrating reservation gadgets work all over the mall, so if you're in for a day of light \"do-as-you-please\" shopping or you're only there for one stop it may be a good idea for you to grab a reservation before you start out into the mall.

Cheesecake Factories are probably the same expensive, yet delicious, food all over the country. You get what you pay for - especially in the case of the Ahi Carpaccio. It MAY (a HUGE may) rival Nobu for the special place in my heart reserved for raw tuna. 

I'm generally unimpressed by their very large salads and pasta dishes. The real stars at The Cheesecake Factory are the appetizers and the cheesecakes themselves. You can never go wrong with the cheesecake varieties. The slices are pretty big, and you may be stuffed from all the food, so it's good to know that they can very neatly split one slice up for two people.

A word on the beers: currently they have Blue Moon, Yuengling, and... I'm blanking on the last one. (It's not Guinness, and that's all I care about.) They have many different bottles, in addition to pricey cocktails and wine."}
{"text":"Have dined there many times. Best chicken piccata around. But got bad Salmon on Sat. night ended up with food poisoning,tasted OK but very sick later. Will avoid the salmon at all cost."}
{"text":"Deliciouso! 

I had the crispy chicken and shrimp with pineapple and it was delicious! Then I had hazelnut and chocolate cheesecake with nutella! Yum :)"}
{"text":"With so many high end restaurants in Vegas, it's nice to have the option of a restaurant with good food for less than $20 a person (without cheesecake, of course).

My SO loves the herb roasted chicken ($18.50). It's very flavorful.  I generally like the goat cheese pear flatbread but last time I had it a this location is was lacking flavour, so this time I opted for the skinny-licious turkey sandwich. I believe the menu said it was oven roast turkey breast, so I expected hot but it was just cold turkey meat. The bun was delicious.

FYI - my SO is looking over my shoulder and does not agree with my 3 star rating. He says his chicken is 4 stars. He can write his own review"}
{"text":"Freundlicher, aufmerksamer Service + die umfangreiche, leckere Auswahl an Gerichten und Desserts + eigene Rezepturen und schmackhafte Zubereitung lassen keine Wünsche offen.

Einziger Kritikpunkt ist das schummrige Licht, das hier viel zu dunkel gedimmt wird. Auch wenn man ein gemütliches Ambiente erreichen möchte ... wenn man ein Handy Display zum Leuchten benötigt, um die Speisekarte lesen zu können, geht das zu weit."}
{"text":"So my fieancee and i decided to grab a quick bite here at cheese cake and our feelings were very mixed.  Our first server seemed nice at first,  but was forgetful about our drinks.  I guess there was a shift change because a new woman introduced herself as our new waiter.  She was not much better.  She seemed very attentive to her four top to our \"miesly\" 2 top.  Then a waitress by the name of Amanda noticed that we were trying to get our servers attention. She was quick, helpful and attentive to our needs. Getting us our 20 min waters in seconds and sharing her story of her new life in vegas and being employed at cheesecake only a month(and killing it). She dramatically changed our moods in a very positive way.  We will be back and will only sit with Amanda!"}
{"text":"I've been to cheesecake factories many times and in different locations. This time I celebrated someone special's birthday here...they don't really have any free treats for the birthday person though... The only thing that they did was to decorate your plate and to sing the birthday song for you. But it was a bit awkward because I felt like they weren't being enthusiastic lol. Oh well. I bet they were exhausted bec it was so many people's birthday. We ordered crispy crab wontons as an appetizer (was okay... Tasted better when I had it in Chicago), steak Diane (delicious! loved everything in this plate! mashed potatoes were flavorful and not dry, mushroom is perfectly grilled and so does steak), bistro shrimp pasta (not too heavy especially with arugula! enjoyed this dish a lot as well), and cookiesncreme cheesecake (absolutely noms! Slightly sweet though!) I also really like their decor. It feels like a story land haha. Cheesecake Factory has a huge selection of menu and their portions are huge... Sometimes it gets a bit difficult to get desserts, especially cheesecakes because that's what they are known for because I always unintentionally stuffed myself too much... So appetizers are probably not recommended if you are not a big eater... Overall, I tend to enjoy my visit to Cheesecake Factory and, in most cases, satisfy with its offerings, so I would return occasionally."}
{"text":"Wow is all that I can say!!! The menu seems never ending. The waitress was amazing and my chicken was as tender and tasty as I have ever tasted. We had 6 people with us for dinner and no one left hungry!! Thank You"}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome on Easter Sunday.....
I tried the pineapple shrimp and chicken with white rice
The rice wasn't as tender as I like it but the flavor of the sauce on top of the chicken and shrimp was tasty.
And of course I had to get a slice of cheesecake to take with me"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this place for years, and for good reason! It is always packed because of the popularity but with the efficiency of the staff, they never have you waiting for too long. This time we had Gary as our server. Gary was very kind, funny and very engaging. My fiancé didn't know what kind of cocktail to have and he recommended a Georgia Peach cocktail which is pretty much now her favorite drink. The food came fast, drinks and service was spot on, and we ended the night with of course, their notorious cheesecakes. Always a fantastic place to go for any occasion!"}
{"text":"John Nagy is the best! He knows how to make a crowd speak to each other! If your in town for a night or two stop bye, he will be on the bar side, you are guaranteed to leave with a few laughs and possibly meet new acquaintances.  

John is the reason most frequent, with his outstanding service, attention to detail, a smile on his face ready to greet, you can't go wrong if your looking for great conversation and an unexpected pleasant evening.  Stop bye, the food and drinks are a bonus! 

\"You are the best John!\""}
{"text":"This place drops in my book each time we go there. 90% of the time the floors are so slippery to walk on. 9 out of 10 times my pasta is always dry from sitting before they serve.  
Service is off big time 



Never fails. Why order a salad or appetizer when you never get it.  Halfway through the main course it shows up.  No thanks.   Once or twice maybe I get the mistake. This is every darn time."}
{"text":"As a frequent customer at Cheesecake factory, I am rarely disappointed in my service. However, today I was extremely disappointed in both the service and my meal. For starters I always order fresh strawberries as an appetizer. The waitress looked at me like I didn't know what I was talking about and gave me a look of confusion. Next when the strawberries were served, they were very old looking.  Just looking at them you could see they were mushy and past their prime. I took two bites and pushed the plate to the end of the table. These strawberries should have never been served!!!  I blame the chef for this one and the server saw no problem with them and challenged me when I brought this to her attention. 

My salad came next and lacked some very important ingredients such as apples. I blame the chef for this one too.  When the waitress came back to the table and asked how everything was, I informed her that I was not happy with the strawberries, at which time the waitress got very defensive and told me that I didn't order them the correct way and she didn't seem at all concerned. 

I also had a take out order I had placed at the beginning of my meal so she could have it ready for when I was done with my meal. When she brought the bill I asked for my to-go-meal and she said she completely forgot! I then, had to sit there for an extra 15 minutes and wait for her to bring me this meal. 

I am not one to write bad reviews but I couldn't believe this service and quality of food (strawberries). Not only did she challenge me as a customer but she challenged other customers as well when they weren't happy."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my family and I went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  We went early because we had a group of 12 and figured it would be easier for the restaurant to accommodate our group if we're there before the dinner rush.  When we checked in with the hostess we were told that our wait would be a little over an hour.  We waited for two hours and were never called to be seated.  We checked with the hostess several times while waiting to see how much longer we had to wait and were assured that it wouldn't be too much longer.  Once our name was called for a table they took us to a booth that could seat 4 people which wasn't going to work.  We went back to the hostess booth and asked to speak with a manager.  We didn't get an apology or an explanation.  Instead he and the staff there were quite rude to us.  My husband and brother-in-law walked down to Brio who said they could seat us right away.  Needless to say, the staff there did not make this an enjoyable experience and we will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The lettuce for my burger was brown and had a slimey consistencey. The water cups had food in them upon arrival. This was by far the most disappointing meal I have ever had. $15 for a hamburger should get you quality food. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our experience was not what we have come to expect from our past experience. It started out bad and ended bad. Service was very slow we sat there waiting to place our drink order for over 15 minutes. It took another 10-15 minutes to get our sodas.  We asked to place our order then and she said \"I will be right back I have a thats order up.\" shes gone for about 10 minutes and takes are order and had to ask for refills on are drinks. Are food took a long time to came out my Pit Beef sandwich was VERY TUFF my wife had the shrimp scampi it was okay the shrimp was a little over cooked a little rubbery. She did not come back to check on us or refill our drinks. We wanted desert but it took so long we were unable. Very disappointed on food and service."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations per James but he said for a party of two it would not be more than a 10 min wait. Ok we will see. Great service and great food"}
{"text":"Who isn't a fan of their cheesecake here ??? Always trying to venture out and trying other flavors but nothing beats the Oreo one at all! Never disappoints! 


I live close by this location and always dine at this location more than any other one. Usually is always steady service, they are usually attentive and get what needs to be done. Only problem is that their staff doesn't seem too friendly. Although they do get the job done it would be nice to have a few smiles on deck here! Great food! Great atmosphere and great menu variety! At times I get lost in such a big menu but than again it's nice to come in not knowing what you feel like what you want for dinner or lunch and have the big options they do. Come enjoy the cheesecake it never fails!"}
{"text":"tldr

We go to this location often and it's always pretty busy but the staff is very attentive and consistent with following up.

Got:
-orange chicken: I usually can't finish this entire dish because of how big the serving is! Come with a small medley of carrots and string beans with a strong zesty orange flavor throughout.

Protip: don't go so hard on the bread basket, the entree portions are very generous and filling."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to dine here a few times while I am in the area. I am impressed that each time the level of service I receive is superior. 

The menu is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. The one thing I can say about this restaurant chain is they are consistent. The food I love to order taste the same whether I am in Las Vegas, Dallas, California or where ever I may be. I have faith my food will be just as good. I tend to dine off the Skinnylicous menu. Many options that taste great but only have less calories. Especially since that warm bread tends to make up for what I cut out. The last time I dined there was a few days ago with my friends daughter. I ordered the Asian Tacos off the Skinnylious menu. My friends daughter ordered the Kids Salmon with Mash Potatoes and Carrots. We were stuffed so no room for all the delicious desserts. The staff from the hostess, greeter, server, and wait staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"We get here after long day of driving to Arizona. We sit down big group. Waitress rude she never asks if it's one bill or two takes everyone's order.    25 min later food comes out. , my daughters seafood pasta had a horrible smell so we tell her she says what do u want instead we order 30 mins later we get it .  Waitress needs more training she was slow rude never filled our drinks we had to ask others to do.  Would I return nope not at all"}
{"text":"Came to the Cheesecake Factory for a late company Christmas party back in January and it was an okay experience. I usually go to the one in GV and compared to this one, GV has way better service. We constantly had empty drinks and even though we asked for the wheat bread, the waitress kept trying to shove the sourdough down our throats. The only reason I gave this location 3 stars was because of the food, too bad the food couldn't save them to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Visit date 7/30/17- that's the day they had cheesecake 50% off. The lines where crazy,  with 1 hour and 1/2  wait after your order your cheesecake. It was so busy with no standing space. A lot of ppl was waiting outside. I had the celebration cheesecake AND IT WAS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD, it's made with cake and cheesecake I WOULD WAIT AGAIN FOR 2 hours!! That's how good this cheesecake was!!"}
{"text":"This place has a decent sized menu. Lots of desserts! Staff was friendly & we were never waiting on anything too long. Food was good."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a rainy monday afternoon and the wait time was still an hour long! But, their buzzer system makes waiting easier because you can just walk around the mall. So, as much as I feel like this would be a great place for kids and families, it may take some planning ahead. 

The food I'd say is pretty average. I got the Parmesan Chicken \"Pizza Style\" which is basically parmesan chicken shaped like a pizza with some angel hair pasta on top. It was quite thin but also very tender. It's apparently one of the most popular things on the menu. I liked it but will probably try other things next time.

I love the bread here. The bread is served warm with a side of butter. The white is a little on the hard side, but the brown one is a lot softer and tastes like a mix of grains and possibly chocolate and raisins. 

Lastly, our table also got the fish and chips (lunch special). It's apparently a smaller portion compared to dinner but it was still pretty big, with 4 pieces of fish, fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce. The fish was quite good, with a crispy batter and flaky on the inside. 

Portions are huge. We ordered these 2 dishes and will probably have them for dinner. 

Service was also great! The place is really busy but I feel like the servers really make an effort to be friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because I try their Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it was delicious, but that's pretty much it. I order cold apple cider and it was not cider, it was more like apple juice and not cold at all. Their price for their 'small plates' is pricey for the portion that you get, very small."}
{"text":"Service was great food delicious. Nice selection of cheesecakes. They don't take reservations so you must be at the restaurant and all the party must be there to get seated."}
{"text":"Sub par at best. Wait staff unattentive. Food is totally mediocre. Got served a Moscow mule in a glass. Wth??  This is only my second time eating at a Cheesecake Factory. Once in Cleveland and once here in Peoria. Hopefully I won't ever get suckered into it again! Hate chains. Buy local, people! $ 10.99 for a Moscow mule! In a glass!!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is always a favorite in our family. Great selections, and you can't go wrong ending your meal in cheesecake. 

I've had decent service most times I go, but there have been a few times that have been sub-par."}
{"text":"The wait staff was awesome! I was always getting checked on and never had an issue with refills. Very polite and unobtrusive. My burger was very greasy and seemed to lose its flavor on the last few bites which is my only complaint, and they were even able to provide me with a moist towel to clean my hands with. The food and desert were both awesome. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've never waited for food for 2 hours.  I walked into CF at 6:30, sat down at 7:15, waited till 7:45 to give my order, and at 9 my food finally came out...one plate at a time, so while we wait for everyone to get their food to eat, we have cold food.  And what about the manager, we complained and he put his tail between his legs to check, but obviously not trained enough to come to us and apologize or offer anything to make the situation better. 
UNACCEPTABLE!  Sorry we won't be back!"}
{"text":"I can see how this would be a very popular restaurant - nice bar, large menu with lots of options and good cheesecake.

My experience has been that the cheesecake here is good for dessert.  Fresh, well made, lots of options and flavors, etc....

Bar is good too with good beer and drink options (Fat Tire on tap is always a plus).

Overall design of the restaurant is pleasant, albeit a bit loud due to very high ceilings.

I just always find the menu, which is very large and varied in options and cuisine types, to be very middle of the road for the actual food.  Maybe because this restaurant tries to offer something for everybody - in my opinon, it results in lighty seasoned food (in large portions, in my opinion, that is not objectionable to anyone but just not that interesting.

I did want to really like this restaurant (not typically a huge chain fan, but really like The District and all it offers), but based on my few visits here, I would have a drink or dessert here, but find the main meal options lacking."}
{"text":"It was my first and my last time at cheesecake factory. The food wasn't great. All of our orders were wrong. I got a mushroom burger and the buns were hard as rocks and didn't come with any cheese like it said,  just lots of mayo, which ended up making my stomach upset. I sent it back once and it came back with better buns but still loads of mayo and no cheese. Haven't tried the cheesecake yet, but my boyfriend said it was good. The only good thing about this place was their sweet potato fries and brown bread. And that wasn't all that great."}
{"text":"The food is good here but the service is horrible. Went at 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was not busy. The waiter (Albert) got our drink order wrong, delivered the appetizer with the meal and then gave everyone the wrong food. We were a party of 3 so there is really no excuse for not remembering who ordered what item.  The appetizer was very cold and had obviously been sitting for awhile.  Horrible, horrible service."}
{"text":"This is a review for the cheesecake only. My wife loves cheesecake. She loves it. She days the red velvet is the best she had ever tasted. We come here mostly for just this. Call ahead fir takeout it us easier than fighting the crowds."}
{"text":"Came on a busy night with a large party (11)  
Wait time was reasonable. Food and service was fantastic. Way to go Cheesecake Factory , an excellent experience! Fantastic job, from tasty fresh guac, to salmon entree and of course dessert and coffee ."}
{"text":"Well, we were all very hungry and we picked Cheesecake factory as it was 1 pm and the crowd was mostly gone.  

We got seated promptly, however, our waitress seemed like she was rushing at every pass.  Ordering our drinks, our food, it was like sit down and tell her immediately what we want.  There was no warmth there at any level.  Very poor service.  We felt very uncomfortable.

Needless to say, we ordered our salads and we ordered Ranch and got Vinagarette!  How does that happen?  RUSHING!!!!  We had to get them replaced twice.

We ordered our entree's along with an appetizer.  So, I don't know what the Brea Ca location is doing right, but the other locations need to follow it.  The QA at this facility was atrocious. We tried the Fried zucchini once again and once again, let down.  There was zero, zip, nada flavor at all.  In Brea, they had awesome seasoning and were cooked perfectly.  Here it was dumped and served.  Just terrible. 

I ordered the Eggplant Parmasean for my Entree.  We waited about 20 minutes only for the waitress to come back and say they were out.  How can you be out of Eggplant at lunch at 1 pm???  Again, lack of rigor and discipline in the kitchen as you should never run out of anything especially a top seller.

So I had to find something else and ordered the Truffle Honey Chicken.  What a disappointment.  Two small pieces of this so called chicken were as hard as a rock.  You had a very hard time cutting it with the sharpest knife and it was un-edible as it was too hard to chew.  It was like eating rocks.

The Gumbo was ok, but slopped in the bowl and lacked any presentation as well as the orange chicken.

We tried to end on a good note with a piece of their new Celebration Cheesecake.  Well, unless you like Icing and I mean a lot of icing this is for you.  However, if you like a cake along with your icing this is not for you.  This was layer and layer of icing on a very, very small sliver of cake.  What a waste.  This one needs to be shelved.

Needless to say, Cheesecake Factory lacks QA across the board and the food gets wasted as it cannot be eaten.  Very frustrated on this visit."}
{"text":"Been going to Cheesecake Factory for years; not only at this location but others throughout AZ and CA.   The food is great and the selection is plentiful.  We always get the chicken marsala, pasta da vinci, Santa Fe salad, and fried zucchini.  Salads are good and the size can feed 2 or 3 people.  The new items on the menu are also very tasty."}
{"text":"I love the cheesecakes, I think I've probably tried each flavor given I work at the outlets! I only get take out but everything I've gotten has been pretty good. 

Although the service seems a bit inexperienced and lost at times they definitely are pretty nice, so I can deal with it. 

Overall good food and exceptional service every time I've been!"}
{"text":"We came here for my friends birthday and it was such a fiasco! We called ahead and stated we had 20 people and the host said we should be able to get a table no problem. Sure enough they had to scramble and find room for us outside saying they never take reservations and had no idea we were coming. The parking situation is horrible and you have to remember to get validated. I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken and the noodles just weren't cooked right. In my opinion, there are too many menu items and they should shrink it to the stuff they know they can do right! I had to add an extra star for the cheesecake though!"}
{"text":"First, we arrived at the restaurant and had to wait because the whole middle section of the restaurant wasn't \"open\".  We were on our lunch hour so ended up sitting in the bar.  Tons of empty tables, just not \"open\" during lunch rush?  Didn't make sense to me.

Second, I ordered the Thai chicken tacos (letttuce wrapped) and bit into something that I thought was a bone.  I spit it out and it was a piece of wood.  The manager said \"Oh, that's the skewer that we use to hold the chicken together while it's cooking\".  Nothing else, no apology, nothing.  

Then, when my friend paid - the waitress rounded off the bill and brought the change back but it was rounded off in the server's favor, not the customer's. 

Love this restaurant.  Have been there tons and tons through the years, but I think service is going downhill."}
{"text":"Watch out locals they always treat the locals poorly here which is too bad because it's a great close place to take visiting family and friends....we just waited 25min. for a 5 top and sat on the first floor with 22 open tables ready and set at 5:30pm?!  Every time I come to this location it's always something I think they are just used to tourists not complaining or having any feedback because they have no choice."}
{"text":"Other than the fact they don't take reservations the good is always amazing!  Cheese cake is really the only reason anyone comes here anyways right;)"}
{"text":"Best Ahi Tartare I've ever had, and I'm not a fan of raw fish! Service is always a little above average, not too much and usually not too little. Tiramisu Cheesecake is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience, the food as always very good but the person in charge of sitting us made no effort in helping us get a table for 10. Even though there were tables available. We ended up sitting in separate booth. Maybe it was my fault for being passive but really left a bad experience. Very disappointed. The open tables were never used and they don't do reservations. If over 4 people,  I will never go there again  even on a Wednesday 5/25 for lunch."}
{"text":"We've came here now several times to eat and everytime we leave dissapointed.  Today before we even orderd 2 of the 4 sets of silverware had old food stuck to it and were not even clean or polished for a higher end style resturant.  The waitress did not seemed very surprised when we showed her. That shows me management is not over looking small details. In a place like this no excuses.  Strike 1!  2 of the last 3 visits we waited a very long time to recieve our food, only to get wrong items or not impressive food.  The one time they felt so bad, because they were out of the appitizer we orderd after waiting for it and then ot never coming. Then I got the wrong meal they ended up buying our entire dinner.  I did not complain or ask for that, but they felt so bad for ruining our dinner.  Strike 2!  So now today we actually had good service, a very interesting Thia Wrap appitizer with 3 great sauces.  Good start!  However our sandwich and salad were horrible.  We orderd the Cuban sandwich and a salad.  The Cuban sandwich was very dry and over cooked.  The bread was way over toasted almost to a point were it was crunchy. It needed a little mustard or a sauce to help out the dry overcooked meat. Then the salad was so bitter tasting I personally could not eat it.  I believe this place has a reputation of being fine dining paired with a large selection of fancy cheesecakes.  I just cant bring myself to like this place. I will not go to a place just for dessert. They are a very nice, classy joint, but always are a letdown on the food.  For the price I feel I should never feel like the food was no good.  We decided today that it will be our last visit.  Consistantly bad in our visits.
 STRIKE 3!  Your out."}
{"text":"So I usually balk at cheesy (no pun intended) overdone chain restaurants like this because they tend to put on a show and trick you into thinking their food is good when it's really not. Cheesecake factory, while overdone decor wise, is not like that. At least not at this location.

I had a business meeting here yesterday with several colleagues during lunch time. We made reservations for 10 and they had our table ready when we arrived. They were prompt about taking our drink orders which I really appreciate because I was parched!

We also ordered two appetizers. One was a chicken lettuce wrap type dish which I didn't care for. The other was a tamale appetizer which was heavenly. I could have eaten the whole plate by myself. If you like Mexican food, you have to try this! I already planned to come back just for this dish. 

After looking over the menu for a long time (because it's a huge menu; like reading a book!) I decided on the hibachi steak with shitake mushrooms, bean sprouts, and a side of wasabi mashed potatoes. The food came out fairly quickly considering we placed 10 orders and the place was pretty busy during the lunch rush. 

My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was so tender. It had a glaze on it that was a little sweet and I appreciate that it wasn't drowned in the glaze. It was like they brushed it on so there was just a hint of it. The wasabi mashed potatoes were great! Being wasabi, I expected them to be spicy but they weren't at all. They had the flavor of wasabi without the spice which was a nice compliment to the steak. 

Last, but not least, we ordered cheesecake. You can't go to The Cheesecake Factory without trying the cheesecake! They have several different flavors and there's definitely something for everyone. I got the dulche de leche cheesecake. If you're unfamiliar with that, it means caramel basically. It came with nuts on it and fresh whipped cream. DIVINE! Because I was so full from my meal, I was only able to eat half of my dessert so I saved the rest for today which I will happily devour when I get home from work tonight. 

Our waitor was very attentive and he didn't seems to mind all of our special requests and our need for drink refills every time he turned around. He was also very helpful when some of us asked about certain menu items and suggested some of his favorite dishes as well.

Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience and I look forward to bringing friends and family back here to enjoy all the deliciousness that The Cheesecake Factory has to offer."}
{"text":"I made reservations a day in advance and I'm glad I did! The restaurant was super busy and the booth that was reserved for us was roomy and had a lovely view of the patio. We were celebrating our friends' 50th anniversary and I wanted it to be special. I told the person scheduling the reservation and the server our reason for being there. I was a little surprised there was really little interest expressed by either one. Some places ask when you make the reservation if you're celebrating a special occasion.
We ordered drinks to start off, they were good and the server was pleasant. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and it was cooked to perfection. My son's filet and friend's steak were equally tasty. We had a special dietary request and the kitchen cooked it just right. The food and atmosphere at this location is very good so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Definitely the shortest wait for a Cheesecake Factory I've ever had! We waited about 15+ minutes on a Friday night, which I consider to be great. In addition, I especially appreciated it because it was CHEAP by Vegas standards. Plus, their chicken pot stickers are to die for. I was drinking sauce with a spoon, embarrassingly enough. I had the chicken piccata, which wasn't the best I ever had but it was fairly good. They gave me an absolute ton of food, which I could not finish. My boyfriend had the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce, which he enjoyed. For the two of us (2 entrees, 1 cocktail, 1 soda, 1 appetizer), it came to $47 with tax, I believe. Not half bad. The service was really good, and the place was absolutely packed. Great experience!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. If this review was based only on food it would have received a higher rating, but it's not. The waitress took a long time to get to us. I understand it was a busy day for them, so we gave her extra time, but it took her way too long to get our drinks. I had to ask for my water 3 times before I got it. At the end of the night she charged us an 18% gratuity that was supposed to be discretionary. She didn't even ask us! She just charged me! The manager we spoke to was extremely nice and helpful. He said that she wasn't supposed to do that, and took the gratuity off of our check. If I go next time I hope our service during our dinner will be better."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad experience but not great as well. Waited about 30 min for a table on a Saturday afternoon. The server was just average no personality. The portions were huge and priced a little high if they shrunk there portions and pricing would give 4 stars"}
{"text":"I love coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Food is always really good. We celebrated my sister in laws birthday and had a great dinner. Meals that were ordered included the grande burrito, eggplant parmesan, spicy chipotle chicken pasta, and spaghetti cabonara. Everyone enjoyed it! The waiter was really nice so we ended up giving the rest of our cake to the staff! We will be back again for sure!  The only cons I would say is the lighting inside (pretty dark) and the pricing is a little expensive but I'm sure people come to the restaurant knowing they are going to pay a pretty penny."}
{"text":"With the many choices available to Vegasites, it's always tough for me when a friend suggests a place like the Cheesecake Factory. I'm totally not a hater (okay... well, in this case, maybe I am a little bit)... but when you live in a foodies paradise, is that the best you can do? Anyhoo... I pull into the parking lot and there's a Semi Limo (as in, truck in the front, limo in the back) in the parking lot. Immediate thought: only in Vegas.... maybe I will be surprised. And, surprised I was. I went for the Spicy Chicken Salad (sub-ing the bird for the shrimp) and was surprised at the freshness of the mixed greens, the bite in the peppers and the distinctiveness of the cilantro. The spicy vinaigrette was also a nice touch. This salad was not the type that would have been made in the Cheesecake Factory I remembered. 

Can I give CF higher than 3 stars? No, not when there are so many other fabulous restos in this city. But, for a good go-to place with lots of options and decent service, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"We have been going to The Cheesecake Factory for years and, until today, have always had great experiences. Usually generous portions!
For that reason, my wife, who is a very light eater, usually orders from the lunch menu which you can get until 5 pm. She loves their chicken piccata...$12.95 for lunch.
Today, at the Scottsdale location, she ordered the same. When it came out, the chicken breast was smaller than the size of her small palm. When we told our server about the skimpy portion, he told us that he agreed and that when it came out he was surprised at the small size. He said he would get us a another piece of chicken for us to take home.  Very nice gesture. After checking with the kitchen, he came back and told us that the chef said that was the standard size and that if we wanted anything else we would need to pay extra for an additional lunch portion. He also said that the chef was new to the restaurant.
Needless to say, we did not have a good experience & that the chef there needs some training!"}
{"text":"I love cheesesteak factory food.  My shrimp scampi was so good!  However the parking for this location is insane!  I ordered curbside to go.  It's not really curbside to go because you have to go in.  Then the parking area is teeny tiny.  Unless you have a compact car don't even try it.  The three parking spots only fit two small vehicles so I could not park.  The whole circle was full of valet cars waiting to be parked.  The valet full sign was blocking the entrance.  I even tried to park in the parking garAge next to the Cheesecake Factory and it was completely full.  I called the Cheesecake Factory and they said they would have valet keep my vehicle on the curb.  But seriously it stressed me out.  I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"We came out on a Saturday night. We understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait. We checked in with our name, party of two, was told it was going to be about a 30 min wait, got our pager, and waited outside since the lobby/foyer was crowded. There were a few parties waiting outside too. 

40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time. 

This kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude. 

They did seat us about a minute after.

Our waiter was awkward too, but he tried. 

We always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert. We live 30 min away, so we like to make night of it when we decide to come out."}
{"text":"Long wait time but their food is worth it. Never thought I order a steak at the cheesecake factory but it was one of the best steaks Ive had in awhile. Very smoky and flavourful, highly recommend it. Second time coming here and ordered another delicious pasta. Would be 5 stars if wait time wasnt so long."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory is a great consistant chain. From Summerlin to Ceasars to Henderson this chain delivers on a diverse menu with great flavor and a very upscale setting for a very pratical price."}
{"text":"Had their godiva chocolate cheesecake. Delicious. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Since its a cheese cake factory its like all the other cheese cake factories. It has solid food but lacks the attention details you will find in the mom and pop shops. its good but not great in my oppinion."}
{"text":"Bland food combined with large portions does not work for me. OK. atmosphere. Consider healthier food please!"}
{"text":"We like to come to Cheese Cake Factory on our cheat days. Nothing better than enjoying a large portion entree and a sweet cheesecake for dinner.  
Today we came in and were served by Isaiah. What an amazing server! He was very energetic and paid attention to small details that separate good servers from superior servers. The service staff here at the Boca Park location is 90% great but today was extraordinary. Even after our server got sat another table after us and a party of 10 at the same time, our experience was never sacrificed. Our drinks were never empty, our order came out prompt and we were never in need of anything. 
Tonight we ordered iced green tea with mint, the chicken marsala and chipotle chicken pasta but we substituted the pasta for mashed potatoes. And for dessert we shared a lemon, strawberry cheesecake. 
Chicken marsala is 2 thin pieces of chicken in a homemade marsala sauce with a generous portion of mushrooms. This is served on a bed of bow tie pasta. The chipotle chicken pasta is a flavorful dish with asparagus, peas and chicken in a warm chipotle sauce. It's not spicy and does not lack in flavor. The portion of chicken is on the lighter side though. All entrees are served with both sourdough and wheat bread with butter at the beginning of your meal too.
There are so many desserts to choose from but tonight we went with one on the fruity side. It wasn't too sweet or too tart. I was actually surprised how balanced the flavors were."}
{"text":"The drinks were good. I had strawberry Martini.  I like it.  The food is OK.  But not amazing.  Waiting 3 hours on weekday for food like that is not worth it.  If I could wait 1 hour,  I might think about it. 
The cheese cakes are the worse thing that we had.  Maybe our expectation is a little bit too high.  However,  it only looks good.  The Lemon Meringue is horrible.  It is too sour and not worth 10$ for a slice like that.  My friend had the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  It is too rich that none of us like it.  He couldn't finish it.   
My other friend had the fresh strawberry one.  The berries is sweet.  However,  the cake isn't rich enough and way too sweet.  Even though that is original cake with strawberry. The only cheese cake that saved the day is Dulce De Leche. In my opinion, I rather have cheesecake in Costco. 
It is good to have experienced it.  but not worth it to come back and wait 3 hours for it"}
{"text":"Went to this location on February 13. Order right before closing time for carry out. I got a meal and a piece of cheesecake. All I really wanted was the cheesecake. Got the meal for my friend. I got Home to realize they forgot the cheesecake. Thanks!! I gave the guy a $20 tip because I felt bad for ordering at closing time. Way to pay attention to detail...."}
{"text":"To preface; I generally HATE chain restaurants. This however, is my favorite chain in the world. Huge variety, consistent quality, and a great bar. Oh yah, the light fixtures and marble/wood accents give the place a warm feeling. I've eaten at all the high end places in and around Pittsburgh: this place is a guilty pleasure. FYI: if you're a food glutton: come on in! The only negative with this place: cleanliness is less then perfect."}
{"text":"Not a good experience.

Do not serve food at your bar if your servers/bartenders can't handle it.  Our bartender was more concerned with his well the whole time then ever worrying about us.  We had to ask for drink refills multiple times.  Didn't care that our whole meal was still on our plates.  

The meatloaf was a dense, old, brick like piece of meat.  The herb crusted chicken was extremely dry.  We both ate the mashed potatoes and that was it.

Just very unfortunate when spending money for a few drinks and a nice meal that the service and food was terrible."}
{"text":"Ok, mostly I'm upset because maybe I'm dumb but I thought that \"Shrimp Scampi\" meant noodles, shrimp, and cream sauce. But I ordered a Factory Combo for $22.95 which I thought was a great deal for the Herb Crusted Salmon, Mashed Potatoes, and a Shrimp Scampi... the kind with the noodles. This should have been called \"Breaded Shrimp and Cream Sauce.\" 

Anyways the mashed potatoes were good but I wanted gravy. The Herb Crusted Salmon was alright. I didn't really like the crust, a bit too bitter for my taste. The breaded shrimp was good and the cream sauce was fine. I really hated the sauce that came underneath my salmon and asparagus, I'm so very glad that they put the asparagus between my salmon and the sauce so that it wasn't already touching and I was able to save it. I love asparagus and mine were ruined. :(

My boyfriend ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger, it was fine. He asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it was quite well done. 

We ordered Chicken Samosas for our appetizer and I thought the cilantro dipping sauce was quite wonderful. I thought the samosas were pretty good.

The star of the show was... 

The complimentary wheat bread!! Omg. It was soooo amazing. It was so warm, nice and toasty... it melted in my mouth, no butter neeeded. It was sweet and just so so amazing. I ate one whole piece and half of the second piece. I wanted to eat it all but of course I had to share, lol and I didn't want to ruin my appetite!

Of cooourse we had to order a cheesecake since we were at The CHEESECAKE Factory! There were so many to choose from I wanted to try em all but we both only had enough room in our bellies to only share one! 

After a long time of trying to decide we chose the Turtle Pecan Cheesecake, it had a yummy brownie crust but not enough pecans. We took off the big chocolate mousse thing, it was better without it.

We needed to check out Cheesecake Factory since everyone loves this place but we just weren't really big fans! The food was just mediocre at best and the service was slooooow."}
{"text":"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory a few times now. Somehow I always end up going on the weekends and it's always so packed. 

Their foods are OK. To me, the menu isn't all that great mainly because I come here just for the finale... aka the cheesecake! Lol. 

However, recently I tried to Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo and omg, it's delicious! I also love the bread that they give you at the beginning. Overall it's an OK restaurant to come if you're around the SS area and/or craving cheesecake! :)"}
{"text":"I've gone to different locations and always order the Parmesan herb-crusted chicken entree, which has flavor, much unlike the most bland dish that they served me tonight. After placing an order for takeout, another member of my party picked up the food for us. Instead of getting the Parmesan herb-crusted chicken, they gave me their Crusted Chicken Romano, which is a great dish for a child. Because there is virtually no flavor. 
But before being stuck with this meal, I was angry enough at having my meal messed up, so I went to the Cheesecake Factory with my dish and tried to exchange it for my actual order and they refused. So I went home to eat the most bland and awful item on their menu. 
Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Ladies and Gents,

The Cheesecake Factory has fallen to a very low point! This is one of my favorite places and sharing this story is disappointing but necessary. 

A friend and I had lunch there Super Bowl Sunday and were excited to enjoy the game. She ordered a salad and I ordered the Pasta Napoletana....BIG MISTAKE! I enjoyed the meal only to get home and suffer a night of hell!! The undercooked pork sent me to the bathroom where I remained for hours, throwing up and ultimately becoming completely dehydrated.

In an effort to make management aware, I called the Rampart location and spoke to the manager. Right away, I knew this was a very young and inexperienced person, he was defensive and said that I was the only person to complain. This child concluded the conversation by stating that the Corporate Office would contact me. That was days ago..... I'm not holding my breath.

The most frustrating part is that my call to the restaurant WAS NOT to complain, but to give management a heads up so that they could check their ingredients and mention this incident to staff in the hopes of preventing a reoccurrence. They basically blew me off, so they clearly don't give a damn about your health either. Word to the wise..... you've been warned."}
{"text":"3 stars for the cheesecake! minus one star for the crowded tables and the flavorless jambalaya. We came here after walking all over the strip because I had a giftcard and the food was just ok. The only thing I recommend getting here is the cheesecake- I can't remember what it was called, but it had reeses crumbled on top with caramel swirls and cheesecake on a butterfinger crust with more caramel. I'm drooling just writing about it...."}
{"text":"Omg. 4 hours waiting in line for decent food. There were too many options to choose from, I really think I got a headache, lol. The food were not bad, but I don't think its worth the wait, but I did it for the gram and I love to give every restaurant a try. Honestly, two cheesecakes are enough for 4 people. I legit almost passed out from the salted caramel cheesecake cause it was so sweet. I wish they offered sugarless cheesecake, but as of for now, get your diabetes. I recommend you guys should just hire someone to line up for you. 
PSA: Happy new year, 2019 is going to be great for me as a hardworking and passionate Yelp reviewer. (hi YELP GM)."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory! I love this location because every time I am here I have GREAT service. I had the crab wontons as an appetizer (my favorite) which are always amazing, and the falafel salad. Anyone who knows me knows that I love me some falafel! The falafel was good but there was something about the dressing that I can't put my finger on that I didn't like, but the veggies tasted fresh and was good otherwise! Of course I couldn't leave there without getting myself cheesecake, and tried the pumpkin pie one which was absolutely delectable! Only other critique I have is that the tables are a little too close for comfort, while the others surrounding us were very friendly my friend and I couldn't have a conversation without one of our neighbors chiming in. But overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty good here and attentive.  Packed on Sunday so make sure you have time.  They accomodate allergies be very clear when explaining."}
{"text":"I came for the first time. I would just come for their cheesecakes. I love their cheesecakes. The only reason why I give a 4 star is because of the price of the items listed in the menu. Yes the food is good, but if they knock a few dollars off it would be even be better.  We ordered chips with guacamole dip and it was really good and fresh. I had the macaroni cheeseburger with fries. The place can use just a little more lighting, it's kind of dark. The restrooms were a bit dirty too, something I didn't expect being in the \"biltmore\" area.  I would come again to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Cheesecake was the best I ever had!! Service was great.  The burger was average at best. Try the wild blueberry and white chocolate Cheesecake"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. It's located right next to the new entrance. Food and service always on point!"}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte for the day from out of town, to take our kids to the Discover Place and Cheesecake Factory! We normally wait 15-20 mins, which we are very understanding of. We got seated to wait 10 mins before a sever saw us. Her name was Blair, I believe. She seemed rather annoyed that we had two kids with us, and preoccupied with other things. We waiting 10 mins to just get our drinks. I am a completely understanding person, especially when a server is seated too many tables at once, but she was talking with other servers, joking around, our son had asked her for some extra dressing and she clearly forgot ( but realized when we had pre-bused our table.) Not only did our drinks were not refilled, she did not once check on us to see how our food was until we we're wanting to order dessert. It took an additional 15 mins to get dessert, which we kinda regretted ordering to have to wait that long. Not only did I leave 20% gratuity, because I am in the tipping business and I do unto others. But I never normally complain on service, and I felt like I was a bothersome to her, I have never had issues at any Cheesecake Factory other than today. But I don't think this woman liked kids or liked us because we are \"young parents\" with tattoos that we would even tip. She probably shouldn't be in this business of customer service. Just BEWARE OF BLAIR!"}
{"text":"I'm a die hard Cheesecake Factory fan. That being said this isn't their greatest location. Yes, it's on south side, but if you plan on doing more then going to AE, Sur La Table or Houghbrah House there's not to much to do. There used to be tons of shops/ other restaurants right in the surrounding blocks but since then has seen a down turn.  It's quite a far walk to the \"real\" south side ( all the bars) but I suppose in the summer months you could make it happen. The food is the same food you'd get at any other location, good size, good taste for the price.  Since this is the only location in downtown Pittsburgh it does get quite busy, so put your name on the list and have a drink in the bar area while you wait! The high tops in the bar are first come first serve, so elbow your way into one! :)"}
{"text":"Tagged along with part of the family to this place towards 9 pm on a Friday night. Driving through the parking lot, I see an empty space as close as one can possibly get to the entrance. I do a double take expecting it to be a handicapped spot. Wrong.  I instantly recognize my new found luck, take the spot  and mutter to myself that this already added a star to my review. (Horrible criteria). I know. 
I quickly walk up to the entrance and attempt to open this 72 foot door for my mother like this castle entrance had no match for her strong growing boy. Long story short, I'm going to blame the automatic hydraulics on the door because it didn't play out in my head as I imagined. It was more of a yank that pulled me in close to the door that may had looked like I caressed the inner panel and humped the outskirts of the door that turned into a side shuffle on the way in.  Rest assured nobody was watching. I continue on and smile at my mother while opening the door and I quietly tell her I opened the door for her because people are watching. (She knows I'm kidding.) 
We walk inside and I scan around to see if anybody might had seen my extravaganza with the front door. I'm quickly reminded that the world does not revolve around me and nobody cares.  I look over and see my brother already has a pager. He wastes no time. Hostess grabs menus and I follow her down part of the isle only to find my family walking the opposite direction. My brother looks over at me across the way and I give him the \"I can't believe we're related\" look because they're obviously heading the wrong way. I turn around soon realizing I'm approaching the table with the wrong family and I followed the wrong hostess.
I make way to my correct gene pool and sit with them. They're notified I was just getting my surroundings and looking for the bathroom. I pick up the menu and start reading. Servers continue to scurry to their tables around us. I eye every one of them as I am actively involved in the sport of people watching. I notice they are all wearing white. White shirts. White pants. White shoes.  I look over at the walls to check for padding thinking maybe I'm actually in an insane asylum and this is my happy place I have made for myself with a 476 item menu and endless cheesecake. I don't question much further. If the shoe fits, wear it.  Our waitress approaches our table. She's all smiles which turns my ugly mug of 12 hours dealing with society around instantly. We order drinks. I ask for lemonade. She then asks if I would like peach, strawberry or raspberry lemonade. I give her a blank stare. I realize this actually is the happy place I have created for myself and I order strawberry leaning against my padded cell. I then order a chicken ceasar salad with an extra side of ceasar. (Boring I know) but I refused to read the novel of items on the menu and resorted to my brain picking up on what seemed like the first acknowledged words out of a 4 page crossword puzzle.  I continue to look around the place while waiting making awkward eye contact with random people throughout the restaurant. Our food quickly arrives. My ceasar salad engulfs 67% of the table as she sets it down. I use no manners and began eating before she can ask if we need anything else.  Grabbed my glass of strawberry lemonade and continued to make awkward eye contact with strangers.  I finished half way through my ceasar then raised my flag in utter failure.  If you're questioning the service, I think my drink was refilled 13 times past halfway point until I resembled violet from Willy Wonka. I knew the Oompa Loompas would be there shortly to roll me out. I did not like the ceasar dressing whatsoever. It taste of spicy seafood for some odd reason. I am not going to bash on the review because of this as our waitress filled the void and to judge such a restaurant on \"my\" opinion of the entire restaurant based solely on ceasar dressing would be just shy of moronic and I would deserve to choke on a crouton. Besides, my family loves this place. 
A slice of strawberry cheesecake landed in front of me after dinner. I vaguely remember discussing it with the waitress as it was late and I was overtired. I think she just came over smiling again and had a desert menu and I mumbled \"strawberries\" trying to avoid drooling on myself and she filled in the blank. Well she was dead on.  Can I say this in a review? That sh%# was good. \"The Cheesecake Factory\" weird, i know. Though it took longer than normal for my taste buds and brain to work intuitively together by this hour, I  still thoroughly enjoyed it. 
We got up to leave once I finished. Oompa's nowhere to be found to assist me in getting through the door never mind opening it this time. (Flaky little bast%#{^)
Overall, I enjoyed my experience and I didn't have far to crawl back to my car. I can say i will patronize this place again with a different menu item in mind. Service was great. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Pretty average for a nice place to go out (that's not fine dining). Hostess said I would be sat in 5 minutes, instead got sat in 15 minutes which was disappointing. It is always better to overestimate on a wait time. The seat was not wiped off prior to me being seated which on a cosmetic and cleanliness level was a minus. Order the Farfalle...with Roasted Garlic. Chicken was a little dry, but the mushrooms had a nice flavor. Did get a shocking bite of garlic which was very unpleasant. My server, Claudia V, was perfect. Volunteered to box my food up for me which is a bonus service. Ordered the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake which was yummy, but not my favorite. It's more tangy than sweet so if you prefer that, than you'll enjoy this. Cheesecake Factory always nails their cheesecake flavors, I will give them that. P.s. it's a little dim inside so if you have a hard time reading, you may need to bring a light source."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has to be one of my favorite chain restaurants that I'm not ashamed to admit I love going to. I'm not sure if it's the fancy cocktails or the ridiculously expansive menu followed by the most decadent cheesecake, but I always feel so fancy when I come here. 

This location is easy to find, but it's connected to Southpark mall so parking can be a bit of a nightmare. The inside is beautiful with cathedral ceilings, ample seating for dining, and a really nice bar area. I wish they had more seating for the waiting area because there is always a wait. If you're lucky, you can find seating at the bar and order your meal there as well.

I have a few staple favorites that are my go-to's when I come here. I love their four cheese pasta with chicken, the steak diane with salmon and potatoes, and their fried mac n cheese balls. The bread is delicious and unlimited as well. Their cocktails are also always delicious. My favorite cheesecake is the 30th anniversary with layers of cheesecake and chocolate cake topped off with ganache. NOM! I also love the regular topped with strawberries. 

I would recommend eating here for the experience, but just know you will have a wait and you will spend a pretty penny, but you will leave full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were just average - overpriced but they try to make up for quality with larger portions.  Nothing special about the food or it's  presentation.  Service was good.  There are better places for less money."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good. Server was not nice- said about two words and left. We came on around 11 and it wasn't busy, so not sure why the sever was so quick and choppy about everything-seemed very rude. Shirley temple had wayyy too much grenadine. I ordered some dish with bow tie pasta and chicken, and I kid you not, there were five tiny pieces of chicken and god knows how much pasta. Will not be going here again."}
{"text":"I was very hunrgy and so my family and I decided to go to Cheesecake factory. We like that they have a big menu and that the desserts are huge. But unfortunately, we ended up not having much fun at all.

On a Tuesday night, we arrived at 7pm and after only 10 min., were seated at a booth, which we had requested. But the booth was so dimly lit that I could't read my menu! Literally... So after a couple of minutes I asked the waitress if we could change seats and she said if I wanted to do that I would have to get up and ask the hostess myself... to which I replied no. I do not have to get up- I have a waitress who can ask her on my behalf. She rolled her eyes and suggested that if I could;t see I should use my iPhone instead... really? How rude, I thought. Why can;t she just help me instead of trying to be sarcastic?

Then the manager comes over and asks me if I would prefer a seat in the middle of the room- with hard chairs. I told him no because our family had just spent 4 hrs on bleachers at the baseball game, so I needed a more comfortable seat. (Not to mention the fact that we specifically asked for a booth from the begging and there are other booths with lights) So he told me that there was no other table. That was simply not true, as there were other tables which had light. There was no sense talking to them. The noise level was really high so I felt like they could't really hear me- or else were;t trying. I was wanting them to help me, but they were too busy to care. They basically said take it or leave it.

I ended up using my iPhone and letting the kids eat... I drank water since I had lost my appetite. It's hard to want to to eat drink and be merry when you are treated like you don;t belong. I did;t bother getting drinks, or dessert, since I just wanted to leave asap. 
I also tried not to be upset with the fact that the waitress barely came to our table and we had to flag her down for napkins, forks, water, ranch, bread... It was exhausting. We left disappointed. I reluctantly left a tip even though I felt like writing her a note on how to treat your fellow man. But I decided that nothing I would say could change their rude, insensitive demeanor. After all, it was such a small request and they made such a big deal out of it. Apparently business is so good that they don't have to treat customers with respect. 

After that experience, I doubt I'll be back anytime soon... but that's OK... I doubt they'll miss me..."}
{"text":"Way too much on their menu, I've been here so many times I have my go to favorites now.  Steak Diane, Shepherd's pie, Chicken Bellagio, spaghetti and meatballs. The worst dish I had was the fish n chips they were either not completely cooked or a different style than I was used to, everything else has been spectacular. My go to place when entertaining guests or celebrating events."}

The atmosphere was very nice. I had the Avocado egg roles and they are from heaven. Amazing. The filet mignon was tender and cooked as I asked. Perfection. Best part was the staff. Brionna was polite and very attentive. Thank you."}
{"text":"We had 35 guest it was for a friends birthday and they did their best to sit everyone next to each other and we were served in a timely manner and even with that many people the food came out fast and it was delicious. 

I had their chicken Alfredo and it was very yummy the chicken was tender and the pasta was cooked perfectly not over cooked not under cooked but just perfect. We were too full to have dessert but their red velvet cheesecake is pretty awesome we took come to go and had it later :)"}
{"text":"My best choice restaurant for dessert. I tried the famous Chris Outrageous Chocolate Cake and found my new favorite dessert! It's so delicate and at the same time the chocolate is not too overpowering the flavor of coconut mousse. The calamari is great, they cooked it just right. I'm highly satisfied with choosing this restaurant for dessert!"}
{"text":"Funny how they reply as though they care but the response on Facebook was just to submit a form on their website, which I had done over a week ago with zero replies to it. 
Terrible terrible customer service."}
{"text":"UPDATE:

Last time we came here we didn't have the best experience. But we came back to this Cheesecake Factory to give it another try. We received the best service hands down from Robbie, The guy with the  man bun, blue glasses and big ol beard. At first he came by our table handed us some waters and bread and walked away and didn't say anything. We were like oh no, here we go again. Then he came back and offered to get us some drinks and such. Honestly, he's not your typical server, but it's what made us like him so much. He's not super bubbly and chatty and fake like half of the servers you get. He seems very genuine and thats what made us like him so much. Definitely will be back. 

Robbie is awesome!!!

This was literally my first bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory EVER! Normally me and my fiancé come and have a great experience, great food, and overall great service. This time we didn't get to experience any of that. 

This was our first time at this particular location. But since we come here so often, we already know what we want to eat. And this time we were on a slight time crunch, wanted to be in and out in an hour. We got sat on the patio, on a Wednesday afternoon. It was a pretty slow section. There were only 3 or 4 tables. So when the server first greeted us, we immediately ordered our food when we ordered our drinks. That was at 2:30, so 15 minutes goes by and our server accidentally takes a fall and hurts herself, breaking glasses and such. She went to the back to get iced up I believe. With all the servers they had all day, you'd think they'd get someone to cover her section. But all we really got was a walk by from a manager asking if we were ok. 35 minutes goes by. And we still don't have our food. Our waitress was back out on the floor. 

At that point I just wanted to walk out, but we did order drinks and still had to pay for them. And my fiancé was starving, so we asked to get our food Togo. 45 minutes later, we get our food Togo. I asked to get our delicious strawberry lemonade Togo, and they gave us a tiny kids cup filled with ice to go with our meal.

As we walked out, I told the manager that stopped by our table earlier that our service was terrible, and all he had to say was that he was unaware of it. We understand our server did get hurt but that doesn't make up for the terrible service. Especially since there's 20+ servers working on the floor at the time. We don't eat at Cheesecake to eat takeout, we choose to eat at Cheesecake for the experience, and this Cheesecake Factory restaurant completely failed us."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time to this particular Cheesecake Factory. We returned after receiving a gift card for Christmas. After having just a decent jambalaya on the first visit (a 2-star visit), i went with the cajun Ribeye with mashed potatoes instead of fries. It also came with onion strings and asparagus. It was very good. It was a hefty portion for a hefty $30 price tag. Our server was excellent on this trip. He was friendly and on top of refills. 
The other entree we ordered was the chicken marsala and it was just ok. We wouldn't order it again.  
The \"6 o'clock sweats\" struck here as well. (See Alessandra's review for details.)
The ribeye and the service made this a 3 star review."}
{"text":"Last weekend, I had an opportunity to enjoy another meal with some very close friends at the Cheesecake Factory in Peoria. I'm not a stranger to this chain. I'm sure I can count the number of visits to this and other locations on more than two hands. It's been maybe a year since my last meal at a Cheesecake Factory.

Last Saturday evening I arrived ahead of my company and the parking lot was full. The lobby was even worse! So when I put my name down for three and was told the wait would be only 30 minutes, I was surprised. And when they paged me to seat us after only 20 minutes, I was shocked. First available, on the patio next to a heat lamp, thank you very much!

Cheesecake Factory has a reputation for having a notoriously HUGE menu. The upside is, they have something that appeals to nearly everyone. And I can honestly say, no matter what I was craving while at a Cheesecake Factory from Chandler Fashion Square to Arrowhead, I've always been highly impressed.

This meal was no exception. I wasn't feeling very hungry and I wanted something a little healthier than my usual fare. My friend Alex recommended the White Bean Chicken Chili. Knowing that my company eat here more than I do, I took the recommendation. It was the perfect entree for a cold night in January. Not to mention healthy and filling. I was very impressed with the other items on their lighter menu too.

Besides consistently delicious meals, the Cheesecake Factory also delivers them with excellent service in a classy environment. Clearly, from the clogged parking lot to the overflowing lobby, I'm not the only one who thinks so."}
{"text":"In general, I try to avoid chain restaurants because if it is a chain I can eat their food all throughout the country. Also, I have seen Cheesecake Factory's gluten free menu and it contained close to nothing for me to eat without morphing the dish into something remarkably healthy (no sauce, dressing, fries, etc). Now, there are times that I want to be healthy, but that's why I cook at home, not when I go to a restaurant called CHEESECAKE Factory. Therefore, my fiance have avoided this restaurant in Caesar's until St. Patrick's Day when friends wanted something familiar to eat.

First, the hostess desk was on top of their game. I got a piece of paper with my approximate waiting time and the time I checked into the desk. They took my phone number to call me when my table was ready which is GENIUS in Vegas. We stayed within the casino, so when they called we came running and the table was ready. Service? It was actually pretty good. I didn't walk away wow-ed by the service, but it was good. Our waters were almost always full, my friends got refills on the bread, butter and alcoholic drinks relatively fast and all went okay. The server split our bills with the greatest of ease since we told him at the beginning of the meal we'd prefer split bills. CF gets the extra 1 star for the host desk organization and service alone.

Yes, this menu is impressive. Salads, pizzas, Chinese, Italian and of course, massive amounts of cheesecake. I looked through the menu and saw the plethora of carb-tastic happiness. I saw a stack of onion straws go by me and I remembered my days of gluten-ingesting intestinal pain. However, I think that stack of onion straws, the flatbread and the pasta could absolutely be worth it. The menu for you gluten-lovers is great. Somewhat predictable, but great.

 My friends eating gluten all loved their food! My fiance got a basic burger, another got the Steak Diane, one got the Kobe burger with American cheese (wrong cheese, but moving forward) and the last guy got the Mac and Cheese burger. I ordered the safest item on the menu for someone that is gluten free which is the lemon and herb chicken with mashed potatoes. It seemed safe at the time, and even though I wasn't starving, I didn't want to be ill for the rest of the night. 

Nobody complained about their food. Everyone said it was great and that they were completely satisfied with their meals. The fries looked pretty standard. I expected a little more pizazz with their fries since everything else was so extravagant, but they were simple. The burgers did not look appealing to me, and I love beef, but then again, everyone except my fiance ordered their cow medium and that hurts my heart. My chicken? Hands down some of the best chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. The best thing? There were bones in the chicken, but the large ones were removed and the chicken came right off the bone. Don't even get me started on the magic wonder of the lemon butter sauce. I could have clogged my arteries with more of that sauce any day. I didn't get sick from the restaurant, and that chicken may pull me back one of these days. Please feel free to take away the red mashed potatoes which were okay, but nothing exciting and almost didn't deserve to be on the plate with that butter and chicken. Replace the potatoes with more chicken and we're good.

I know this one was long, but I like to approach a meal from all different angles. I wanted to give this restaurant 3 stars because for me, the GF options were severely lacking for a major chain restaurant, but what I did eat was great and the restaurant organization was on-point. If you want something that's not specifically Vegas but reliable and perfect for picky eaters, come to Cheesecake Factory and you'll be happy with your choice."}
{"text":"I sat down and ordered food to eat in and food to go.  It took over 30 minutes to get our food and over 45 minutes to get our to go food.  We never saw our waiter again until we needed to leave.  In speaking to the manager, she made no apology, no bill adjustment just simply helped him to get the food which still took another seven minutes, and was missing 1 dish.  I'm appalled the restaurant did nothing to appease the customer...."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night Adam was our server , He was so amazing and the best service we've ever gotten there . We had a party of six and he was Johnny on the spot ! We love the food and the service is always great but last night it was exceptional !"}
{"text":"Omg this 4 cheese pasta is amazing!!!!! For brunch, definitely order the cinnamon pancakes!"}
{"text":"Of course the wait is long but the person who gave us our pager did not inform us there was a range so our wait was longer than it should have been but that's okay. Customer service was exceptional with my waiter, Jonathan, he was very patient even though we took forever to order because of the encyclopedia of a menu they have. I got the burrito which, warning, is very big for the average person but clearly I'm not average because I ate the entire thing. Cheesecake is delish and I mean like real good stuff. An experience you should try once if you live in the area but not exactly something I would keep coming back to-it's just American style food nothing that crazy."}
{"text":"Not only is this my favorite chain restaurant, it's also my favorite restaurant. The variety is so immense. You could have your pick from so many different cuisines from American, to Italian, to Chinese, and so on. There is always something for everyone, and they have insanely huge portions. This makes it so you always have some left over for later that day and the next day. 

It's always important to save room for the cheesecake though. My personal favorite is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. It doesn't get much more satisfying than that.

I know this is a really short review, but the food is excellent, the service is top notch, and the ambiance is fantastic. The only thing that would negatively affect my review is the wait to get a table. If you come on a weekend night, expect to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to half an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"GREAT TIMES!

Kids were able to talk & make noise aa kids do. The atmosphere was very relaxing. Tge waitress, actually sat with my 3 yr old daughter to get her to eat. It was awesome. 

The food was great. I ordered the catfish & planned on taking a picture but .... That did not happen. Sorry...I ate it all. 

Sidenote: my 3yr old only wanted meatballs...not spagetti and meat balls. This was not on menu, but the waitress made it happen!

Great times!"}
{"text":"Every time i go to Cheesecake Factory i always get the same dish. They did a magnificent job preparing my meal. They even followed my request to the T on a to-go order. When most locations can't even get it right when i dine in. It was such a wonderful experience. The food was prepared in a timely manner. And it tasted simply amazing. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for always making my tastebuds dance"}
{"text":"Michael our waiter was frickin amazing! From start to finish he gave us 100% wow customer service. He greeted us with such awesome enthusiasm. He was quick with everything we ordered and he made great conversation with us. Table of 6 and handled all of like we are his best friend. 5 stars across the board Michael"}
{"text":"Went here for cheesecake after dining at Roosters access the street (which is phenomenal btw!). This was my first and last time visiting cheesecake factory. I ordered the vanilla bean cheesecake which was mediocre. The cheesecake came with more whipped cream than there was cheesecake. The worst thing, I asked the waiter if they could drizzle a little strawberry drizzle over the top and he said sure no problem. He brought out a small dish of what appeared to be gelatinous strawberry filling that couldn't have been drizzled if you tried. Absolute fail! Oh and I almost forgot, it took TWENTY MINUTES for an order of cheesecake only... We didn't even order food!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice clean, well lit place.  Really good service and our server was wonderful.  I ordered the factory burger. The sourdough bread was cooked too much and was  too hard to cut and the meat was burned.  Most disappointing considering where I was.  I'm sure I'll try it again another time."}
{"text":"The place I will always remember, the place I got engaged! They always have great food! My favorite is their ranch and Caesar dressings! Cheesecakes to die for! And the staff is always great and on top of everything. Only one time I was feeding soup to my 2 year old and there was a paper clip inside his soup that my husband took a bite of. But you know restaurants arn't always perfect, but this place is way better then some. I love the Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"With a table of 5, we managed to get a table over the holidays after a total of 4 hours wait time. We waited 30 minutes in line to get the buzzer and were informed the wait time would be 3-3 1/2 hrs at that point. 

We ordered the Fried Calamari as an appetizer, which was great. For mains, the Steak Diane, Chargrilled Bone-In New York Steak and Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon. The portions were large, but nothing spectacular. I particularly did not enjoy the salmon entree, as the sauce had too much of a vinaigrette taste for my liking.  

As for the dessert, we settled with four different cheesecakes and all were amazing. I highly recommend the Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake, although you can't go wrong with any of the options.

In conclusion, I would give 4 stars based on the cheesecakes and good service. However, the wait time and mediocre entrees bring it down to a 3."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday. Had a waiter named James G, as it reflects on the receipt. I mentioned to him that it was my birthday 3 times. I hear the \" Happy Birthday\" song being sung several times around me. All he did was talk...not listen...talk. Customer Service is listening to the customer, hearing different hints and she's. He didn't get the hint that it was my birthday after mentioning it 3 times. He told me I should have requested it, and they would have relayed the message to him. Why does someone have to relay him a message when I said it several times? No one else asked. Their waiters knew. I didn't ask. I told him he had 1 flaw. Not hearing me mention it 3 times. He had some excuse on why he didn't do it. Several excuses. Because he didn't want to ruin the surprise. Well...it's not a surprise if I'm telling you, but good excuse though. Thanks for making my birthday night memorable James G."}
{"text":"Before coming to Cheesecake Factory, I HATED cheesecake, but so many of their options (I think there is about 50 of them) are so knock-out good that it doesn't feel like you're eating a typical cheesecake.

One of the biggest pluses about this place is the selection, they have so much on their menu across all types of cuisine that it's literally in a spiral bound notebook.  I kept getting a four cheese pasta until I asked the waiter for other suggestions and since then, I have still never been disappointed with the food.

I don't come here as often as I like since the locations are far away and the wait is normally long, but it is well worth all of that for the food!"}
{"text":"When with family, shopping in Caesar's Forum this is the perfect choice!
The service excellent! As always in a Cheesecake Factory.
Anyone can find something they like on this giant menu! The food rock solid, not amazing, never terrible, but consistently good!"}
{"text":"Here is my guilty confession, I like Cheesecake Factory! There I said it! 
I have enjoyed my experiences at everyone that I have gone to.
Boston, San Francisco, San Diego and now the one at Boca Park!

Went in for dinner and was seated right away. 
After combing through the GIGANTIC menu. and it is! So many tempting options!
I decided to go lighter, to save room for the ....you guessed it CHEESECAKE!! Hell YA! Sorry, but here the entree is just an appetizer for desert. 

Ordered the herb crusted salmon, served with fresh mashed potatoes and a few tasteful displayed spears of asparagus. It was really great! Cooked perfectly, light tender and moist. My friend ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (OK, not so light for him, but he loved it!)

Then we split a Red Velvet cheesecake. OMG...We were in cheesy, frosted, sugary heaven!! SO GOOD! And splitting this giant piece was absolutely the right call!"}
{"text":"We went to eat at Cheesecake Factory on 12/31/2015... We waited about an hour before we sat down. We are arrived at about 7 and got seated about 8pm...That was the only complaint I have. I do understand it was NYE. And it was packed.."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday with about 18 guests. We had two servers that did not flinch at the size of our party! They were courteous, kind and provided excellent service! I would highly recommend this location for the food, the servers and the amazing service!"}
{"text":"Follow up from our dinner Jan 21, 2017 review listed under Mary P. 
The Cheesecake Factory responded and asked that I visit their website. I have responded twice and I have heard nothing back from them. 
It looks as if their online - yelp attempt to resolve this issue was fake. Not sure why they would tell me to contact them for nothing."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location many times and have never had an issue with the service or food previously. However, I had an awful experience today that warrants a one star rating. 

In honor of national cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory is offering half price cheesecake. What a deal! And it is. But who knew that you'd have to deal with snotty, rude and unprofessional employees in order to get your piece of the pie, or cheesecake, in this instance? 

So I go in and it's busy. Like really, really busy. And of course it is! The best cheesecake on planet earth is half off! I go right to the counter line and after waiting for about 5 minutes (which was actually quicker than I thought it would be considering how busy they were) I got to the counter and get not so much as a hello, hi, what can I get for you? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Just a girl staring at me waiting for me to place my order. Ok-they're busy and she's probably stressed. I get that. No biggie. 

I requested 4 pieces of cheesecake - 2 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. Alas, I was informed that it's only 1 piece half off per person. Since I'm there by myself, I'm basically only able to get 1 piece at the discount and the rest will be full price. No problem - it makes sense to put a cap on it so that people don't go crazy. I decide that I don't want to pay full price for 3 pieces and adjust my order to remove the salted caramel and just ordered 2 Reece's and 1 snickers. 

I pay and even leave a small tip ($3) in the tip cup. I walk away from the counter and a couple minutes later she calls me back to get my cheesecake. I look in the bag and unfortunately there's 1 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. NOT what I'd ordered, paid and even TIPPED for! This, my cheesecake loving friends, is how the rest of my visit went - verbatim:

Me: Oh shoot, I didn't want the salted caramel. That was the one I cancelled. 
Her: So what do you want then?
Me: 2 Reece's and 1 snickers. I'm sorry. 

* At this point she ROLLS HER EYES and SHAKES HER HEAD, takes out the salted caramel and walks away. I am so disappointed and feel like I'm putting her out when in all actuality, it was HER that made the mistake and ME that was being apologetic about it. Huh? *

Me: (out loud and to no one in particular) Not sure what that attitude is all about. 

The manager is standing there and overheard my comment and this is how the remainder of my visit went, again verbatim:

Manager: Well you know what it is, ma'am? We're not even supposed to be doing this. 
Me: You're not supposed to be doing what?
Manager: Giving half price for take out orders. We're actually only supposed to be honoring it for dine in customers. 
Me: Well I certainly appreciate that you're honoring it but I don't think the attitude that comes along with it is necessary. 

And at that point I got my CORRECT cheesecake and walked out. 

It's unfortunate that the manager chose to defend his employee ROLLING HER EYES and SHAKING HER HEAD at me rather than apologize for her completely unprofessional and unjustified behavior. Like I said, I get that they're busy. I understand that it's a stressful job. And I definitely appreciate that they honored the discounted price when, apparently, they didn't have to. But as a customer, I should not be treated that way, especially when the mistake wasn't mine and I was kind and gracious even when she made the mistake. 

Shame on this employee and shame on this manager (both whose names I didn't get, dang it). Hopefully their attitudes improve-for the sake of other customers who don't deserve to be treated so poorly."}
{"text":"I went to Phoenix to spend time with my Grandmother. She is going to be 86 this year and has been having a bunch of health problems so when I told her I would be coming to town, she asked if I would take her to see her financial planner who works in this area. He is great and often drives all the way to Sun City West to see her or they conduct business over the phone and email. Since it is schlep for my mom to do this, I was happy to take her. We had an appointment around 1:15 and since Gram moves a bit slower than either of us expected, our plan to have lunch before the appointment didn't work out so we had lunch afterward. This is how we ended up at CF. She was starving and knew they had a lot of options and she didn't feel like Miracle Mile (and I knew I could eat at the one in Arrowhead)

Cheesecake Factory is CF. I know now that I like their burgers and I love their garden salad. It is full of great veggies like shredded zuchini and beets. Gram had the meatloaf and ate about 3/4 and then decided it wasn't as good as it used to be. I refused to let her send it back (one of her favorite things to do-eat more than half and then complain so she gets either a comped meal or another meal that she takes home for another time)-yes,I am outing her trick and she knows I am on to her....

She let me pay because I didn't let her send her food back. Luckily and our waitress was a doll who totally got it. She was from San Jose so we had a good time chatting about the Bay Area and the differences between here and there. 

The reason why I am not giving this location 4 stars is because the slice of cheesecake we ordered had some nasty strawberries on it. I have a good taster and when I bit into one it was like biting into an overly acidic chemical taste. I told the waitress and she brought us a plain slice. The waitress told the manager who came over to tell me that NO ONE had ever complained about the strawberries before. I told him to taste one and he looked at me like I was crazy. A few minutes later, our waitress came to me to tell me that the manager did taste the strawberries and that I was right -DUH. Had he come back to tell me this himself, he would have bumped up the star rating in service...

Gram said she likes the location in the Arrowhead area better, though we did have a good time talking about all the changes in Phoenix and the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"Very good food, I am very picky so when I first look at the menu I was like \" nope this not the place for me \" bit then I saw that they had the food I did like and that I was farmilair with also they have a kids menu with a great selection sleekly for my kids and to top it off warm bread at your table whole grain and white bread"}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend here around 8pm on a Wednesday night. She was in need of a nosh and I was in need of an adult beverage. We knew CF was open later than a lot of places and I have typically had decent luck here. This location is better than some and not as good as others. I think it is probably hit or miss depending on what time of year and what time of day you come.

It was during this visit that my friend and I realized we have been legal to drink for 20 years now but have had been \"drinking\" together since we were 15 or so(shshsh-don't tell my folks). I am a cheap drunk-or shall I say a lightweight. My friend ordered Vodka/Cranberry (aka-a Cape Cod) and I decided to join her but to make it a better vodka for both of us. The drinks were weak. Seriously weak. I am typically a 2 sip and buzzed gal and yes, I said something. Our waiter apologized, made sure my friend had extra goodies for her meal and for just a meager $2.00 extra, I added a shot (split between our cocktails) and voila, we were able to make a decent drink. 

Don't worry CF-I am sure I will be back though you are located in the same vicinity of nearly every chain restaurant. If only I could get Grandma to come here with me instead of Red Lobster...but CF doesn't do coupons!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chains in the area. The pricing is expensive but the food is worth it. Very tasty food and big enough portions that you will be able to get another meal out of the leftovers."}
{"text":"Call it what you will, but the food here is very well more than good enough, and would taste even greater if it didn't come with the label of \"chain restaurant.\" If you are concerned about the caloric content of each serving that could feed a family of five, then, eat a fraction of it and have the rest packed to go to, um, feed your family of five... just sayin'"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our dinner tonight. Sure it was Mother's Day and crazy busy, but I do expect a clean table (there was dried, sticky food all over our table when we were seated). GROSS! The young man who came to clean it wasn't very happy to do so, so I took the washcloth from him and did it myself. My husband ordered the bang bang chicken & shrimp and said it had about 5 pieces of chicken & shrimp and he was not impressed with the flavor. I had the orange chicken which was served cold & sauce-less. Our bill was well over $100 and I'm sorry but I just expect better. On a more positive note, the kids meals were big and the Oreo cheesecake was rich & delicious (not as impressed with the banana cream though). Unsure at this point if we will return for more than desert."}
{"text":"Fabulous staff, from the moment you enter you are greeted with smiles and hellos. The waitress had suggestions on local favorites and Chefs best meals. All are good but some are amazing per our waitress and truly ours were amazing! Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 chinese chicken salads to eat in and one to go. Simple right...not for them!!! All came without wontons, one had NO chicken, salads mainly lettuce. They forgot to bring the dressing. Had to keep asking for the dressing, the chicken, bread...We asked one person and another would bring the item. Five different people came to our table, none knowing what the other one had been told by us. Very frustrating. The mandarin oranges were well hidden since there were only two in a salad. The to go salad had no wontons, no rice noodles, and only one small dressing when I asked for two. There was no bread- had to ask twice for it. It seems that a restaurant that has been around for some time should know about customer service and how to make one of their most popular salads. No manager ever came to apologize in spite of my telling one of the five people who came to our table during their game of \"telephone\" that they need to stop sending different people who don't know what we told the previous one. Have had similar experiences with to go orders- never seem to get it right and don't seem to care. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I find the Cheesecake Factory to be one of the more tolerable chains.  This time around I ordered the fish tacos and he ordered the chicken and shrimp jumbalaya.  I've had better fish tacos, I've had worse.  These fish tacos were somewhere in between.  Neither dish knocked my socks off.  I guess it was good enough and the price is right given the sheer quantity of food that you are given.  

The bread is always warm and soft and I have no issues with the service.  We came around 8pm on a week night and didn't have to wait.  

I think the Cheesecake factory is a reasonable choice to go eat if you with a group of friends just because the variety on the menu, the nice ambiance and they are relatively inexpensive. (Most entrees around $11-16)."}
{"text":"I mean... Who DOESN'T love cheesecake? If you don't, you clearly have no soul. 

Ugh. I don't even know where to start. I always come here solely for the cheesecake. I've almost tried every single one. I wonder if I can put that on a resume under my accomplishments. Hmm... I'll have to further think about this.

Anyway... The cheesecake. Unf. My favorite is the turtle cheesecake because the crust is a goddamn brownie. A BROWNIE, PEOPLE. So. Effing. Sexy. 

I haven't had much experience in exploring the actual lunch/ entree menu, but I will say that the potstickers are pretty fucking sexy as well as the guacamole. Oh man, the guac. Soooooo delicious. 

I've only ever ordered the Pasta Da Vinci and it's fab. A delicious wine-based sauce with chicken, onions and a variety of mushrooms. It's really, really good. 

I've never had a problem with service, as all of the servers I've ever had were super friendly and accommodating. I thoroughly enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Lunch special for $12. I got the chicken fettuni w/sun dried tomatoes. Not really worth it although you can make two meals out of it. Eh, I can make better pasta myself."}
{"text":"A very good friend  treat me  a dinner here. 
The place is beautiful and clean.The staff are quick and friendly. 
Its pretty cool to dine outside the porch,kinda sweet  and relaxing.lol.(we can  count the cars and  people passing by)
 My first impression with the waitress,shes seems unhappy..lol but I was wrong.. she's cool and amazing, she can ride on my jokes..lol..
We had miso salmon with brown rice , so far, it taste good...yummy....
The place is full, therefore   people love to dine here..try it for yourself."}
{"text":"This dining experience was just alright to me. For the money and wait I expected much more, assuming basic things like condiments, choice of salad dressing, and choice of soup. Instead, you get what they give you. No frills. In my case, an ungarnished turkey sandwich, mushroom soup, and a bland salad. On the upside, the turkey was high quality and the bread was fresh."}
{"text":"Overdone and half baked concept food fare fosters a large belly with a check of equal size for what is now average food at a big box food factory. Far too dark at night - Just get dessert and head for the hills."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Ask for Deann she is very attentive and has great customer service. She was great with my 4 year old twins."}
{"text":"If you are hungry and not sure what kind of \"food mood\" you are in, the cheesecake factory is your spot! The menu must be at least 10 pages and includes almost every type of food.  

Some of my favorites on the menu are the cobb salad, clubhouse sandwich, bbq chicken sandwich, fish tacos, chicken penne pasta, and grande burrito.  I have had almost every type of dessert that they offer and by far my favorite is the snickers cheesecake.  

The service at this location has always been excellent and although it gets extremely busy towards dinner time, they are prompt and never have too long of a wait until you sit down.  

Overall, I have had nothing but great experiences and delicious food at Cheesecake factory and I recommend it if you are looking for a wide variety of food and large portions for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We've been here many times over the years. I like the large selection of food to choose from. Salads, burgers, pasta, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, meatloaf, Indian inspired... pretty much anyone should be able to find something here. A lite menu that is extensive and vegetarian options. I love the \"bang bang chicken and shrimp\" (chicken, shrimp and veggies in a delicious peanut sauce topped with rice and toasted coconut), their burgers and ceasar salad with grilled salmon. They have a salad with a wide variety of julienne cut veggies that is really good. I've had chicken tacos and have been pleased. I can't think that I've ever been unhappy with my meal there. My kids and husband are always happy too. To drink, I like the iced green tea with mint leaves.

Ok, the important part... CHEESECAKE! My personal favorites are the Oreo cheesecake and the Adam's Favorite (a delicious peanut butter and chocolate fudge cheesecake). I've also had the pumpkin pecan cheesecake  (the crust is too hard, we got this on our last visit and weren't impressed), red velvet cheesecake, carrot cake cheesecake, white chocolate raspberry... probably others too. I mean, it's cheesecake, how bad can it be? Usually the cheesecake does not disappoint. 

The service can be hit or miss. We are usually happy, but last night our server just really didn't seem like he wanted to be there and we didn't get great service because of it. Also, I don't like when we are seated at a small table adjacent to other tables (one side shares a long booth type bench), I feel that it lacks privacy because we can hear everything that is being discussed by the parties on either side of us. It's distracting. Not ideal for our \"date night\" which we don't get very often."}
{"text":"Aside from the waiting, everything here is decently priced and the food is delicious. Staff are amazing, and good portions. If you're here just for cheesecake - do take out; it's faster, and usually no line to do it.

It seems as if all the other negative ratings here are mostly from the wait - well guess what: the hype is real with this location. If you're just as hyped to visit, then there are at least a hundred others with the same thought.

Arrive early. Get a buzzer. Come back in an hour or two after shopping around, and check in with your current wait time."}
{"text":"Talk about options!  It's almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu.

So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.  

The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.  

I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered. 

I will go back again!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the bar, and specifically for Michael. He was an awesome bartender and made us a delicious Ultimate Margarita & offered us complimentary bread and butter. We went shopping, then came back for more! It was a great addition to our day."}
{"text":"Our waiter smelled like alcohol. I do not believe he was drunk, just extremely hung over as he was still sweating all the booze off. Food was great but service was slacking."}
{"text":"It's cheesecake factory! 

My team and I had a good time here. Our server was awesome. My only negative was that they took the Wasabi crusted tuna off of the menu. 

My meal: 

app: firecracker salmon (that red cabbage is soooo good)
main (1 choice): wasabi-crusted tuna with white rice and veggies (discontinued dish)
main (2nd choice): something (fish dish) not even memorable 
dessert (my fav): tiramisu cheesecake (YUM!)"}
{"text":"This location is always great and has excellent customer service. One of my favorite restaurants because they have such a huge menu selection and yummy cheesecake!"}
{"text":"We didnt have to wait at all. Big menu, was told its new as of 6 months ago. 
Lots of food to choose from almost too much to choose from.
Huge portion, get ready for doggie bag, left overs are the best.

At the end shared 30 year celebration cheesecake cause we went to celebrate  our 24 yesrs of marriage .
Clean, fast , friendly staff , . Best part while waiting for food to come , you get bread hot warm , it will fill you up 
Ask gor Jennifer , she was great"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with whatever I order. The service was great and the food was on point. We ordered the grilled steak tacos and the honey truffle chicken. They were both delicious. If you like a bit of spice, the tacos are for you. We subbed the rice and Beans for loaded mash potato. Yum. The honey truffle chicken was sweet and the chicken has a nice crisp to it. 
Service was fast and friendly. We didn't need to ask for anything."}
{"text":"I really want to give this a 2, but since the food was good...I have to make it a 3. I ordered the southwest chicken sandwich...and a few minutes later the water told me they are out of the bread it comes on, so I needed to order something else. I asked if I could just have it on a different type of bread and he said no. Apparently, the ingredients are \"pre-measured\" for the type of bread it goes on....WHAT?!?!? Just change the damn type of bread! If a kitchen can not just make the sandwich fit on a different bread, we have problems. So, I ordered the chicken avocado club, and it was decent. Chicken was cooked well, fries and ranch were very good. Husband got the lunch shepherd pie and he said it was good as well. I'd suggest skip it for food (it's a chain...I mean, it is what it is), and just go for cheesecake."}
{"text":"I can see why people like this restaurant. It's beautiful inside, the menu is diverse, and who doesn't love cheesecake? I feel like cheesecake is the only thing they do right at the Cheesecake Factory. I appreciate that there are many options on the menu but the food is too rich for me. Everything is either fried or drenched in butter. I wouldn't refuse to eat here but its not my first choice when going out to eat."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE on every level. My husband and I got takeout from this specific location one time. I had stuffed mushrooms with a turkey burger, and he had some sort of salad with a turkey burger. As he was eating his salad, he noticed a bug on the lettuce he almost put in his mind. Mind you the lettuce was halfway in his mouth, luckily the bug fell off before he consumed the whole thing. He literally spit his food out, and I did the same. He took all our food back - and the manager tells my husband \"well there was a bug in your food because it's humid outside\". For crying out loud there is NO excuse for live bugs to be in anyone's food!!!  He offered a cheesecake which of course my husbanded declined. Several years later we tried takeout again from this location. Don't ask why, because honestly I have no idea why. We should've learned our lesson the first time right?  Well my poor husband again had another horrible situation. As he bit into his turkey burger it was completely raw!!!!!  That was the last time we've ever been to Cheesecake Factory. And mind you the kids pasta was awful. Felt like they took the noodles out of the box and threw some butter on top and didn't bother cooking the noodles. Do yourself a favor and just eat at home, or at least stay away from this Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is always a good place to go to when you want a variety of foods.  There menu is so big sometimes it is overwhelming but everyone can always find something they want.  The service is always good and our waiter, Michael was great.  We are from NY and so was he so we had a great time.  My husband ordered the herb crusted salmon and he said he was cooked perfectly.  I had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich which was great but I was disappointed because on the menu it offered two variations but Michael said they were discontinuing the Korean style so I could not get the spicy cole slaw I wanted.  Our friends had the Cuban sandwich and they loved it.  Of course the portions are so big we were too full to have any cheesecake."}
{"text":"My husband and I highly recommend THIS Cheesecake Factory in Henderson, N.V.!! First of all, there is plenty of parking to be found and the area is very scenic as well! Now, onto the good stuff......The menu options and the customer service that we received from Terry Cola and Staff was OUTSTANDING!! You will be treated 'like royalty' here and the food is super-fresh (gotta try those Summer Shrimp Spring Rolls while they last!!) and the Cob Salad we had filled me up (and that's not easy to do since I have a big appetite and love to chow down!). Do yourself a favor....If you find yourself hungry in Henderson, stop on into the Cheesecake Factory for Lunch/Dinner! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss for me.  I've been there several times and it depends on the server who will make it or break it for me.  My other 3 visits were good but the last one wasn't so good.  The food is always pretty good.  The last server I had served me flat diet coke or pepsi and when I complained about it he said \"yea we always get complaints about it\".  I finished my meal and about 15 minutes later he came in with another diet soda from another station and asked me to try it.  I did and it was good except for the fact that I was done with my meal and would've enjoyed it better during.  Desert is always spot on!"}
{"text":"Having been to The Cheesecake Factory many times, we anticipated great food and great service. That is exactly what we got tonight. Our server was attentive to our table, including our two children, and she made sure we enjoyed our meal and our experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Having seen other people try several other menu items, we each decided to try new things. We started off with the Fried Macaroni and Cheese and Guacamole & Chips. My wife had the Lettuce Wrap, I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and our guest had the Pasta Di Vinci. We will each have these again one day soon...unless we decide to try something new again. We always enjoy our meals and service at The Cheesecake Factory. (Sorry we did not post pictures this time, we were really hungry)."}
{"text":"My wife and visited this cheesecake location earlier today for lunch....what a fiasco! Waited almost 50 minutes for food.... because waitress forgot to turn in our order......when my chicken salad finally arrived....wait for it... wait for it....it had NO chicken. For this I got two \" sorry about that\" from the waitress and no apology/acknowledgement whatsoever the the manager??"}
{"text":"Good service but poor food
Chicken teriyaki was pink on inside, they baked bananas instead of using plantains. Plain white rice and too much teriyaki sauce. The only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars is because we sat in a nice outdoor area, next to a water fountain under ceiling heaters."}
{"text":"Never been impressed with over priced, not that great food, cheesy servers, Cheesecake Factory. We were there for my daughters birthday. She wanted to come here, so I had to. We had 10 people there. Five foster kids, wife, daughter, her boyfriend, and her boyfriends brother. You can imagine how much the bill was. And for what? Their food has always been famous with the amount of calories in their servings. And you would think their food would be better? NOT! Sorry just not worth, you can get a better value for your dollar elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good place to spend a rainy afternoon. Ordered the appetizer Nachos with spicy chicken, it was a huge portion. Finished about 1/4 of it and the rest was snacks for later. The clam chowder soup was also a hit.  Simple, good service, good atmosphere, good food, reasonable price, what can be better."}
{"text":"I took my wife here last night for her birthday, I informed the hostess of her birthday and requested a happy birthday song by the staff.. no problem was her reply.. as we ate dinner, we heard 4 birthday songs being sang to various patrons.. we finished dinner and received the bill but no birthday song for my wife so we paid and left.. Our next Cheesecake Factory visit will be elsewhere ."}
{"text":"Definitely loved this place. 
Came in hostess greeted us promptly. 
We got a seat right away, a nice intimate booth kind of away from many people, also away from the main entrance.
 
Ordered the Pineapple Moscow Mule.
Which BTW comes in a Pint glass with a Pineapple sliver in it. It was delicious ! --Recommended Drink for roller ghat love tropical fruit.

I ordered the Gumbo and white rice (Which was amazing) bf ordered the Jambalaya pasta which was also delicious. Whatever sausage they put in it is amazing. 
-- crab bites are amazing as well for appetizers! 
Service was prompt polite and very Tentative and professional. Our waiter even boxed up our left overs for us. 



--- above is my previous review 



However... I heated up my left overs today for lunch and There is a large piece of glass that was found in it.

I change my mind. 
Won't be returning ."}
{"text":"Maybe you should fucking update this and let us know how long you're fucking closed for because no one fucking answers and the hotel operator doesn't fucking know and I waste my fucking time driving here after work and walking there to find out it's closed"}
{"text":"Review #099 - 2017

My friend and I were walking around the outlet and got hungry in the middle of our shopping trip so we decided to head over to the Cheesecake Factory for a quick lunch.  We showed up around 1:30 PM for lunch and were seated within 5 minutes.  

I felt really terrible because we were walking for quite a while before my friend told me that she was starving.  I'm such a bad friend!

Our waitress came to greet us and brought us some iced water.  We ordered an appetizer and one item each and decided to share everything.

I wanted to try the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks as our appetizer, and I am so glad that it turned out to be really good or else I would've been really disappointed since my friend told me to choose.

She ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and asked if she could have a side of salad, but I told her that I was going to order the factory chopped salad and she could just share some of mine.  Good thing we decided to share everything because their portions are no joke.  We enjoyed everything we ordered.

Service was pleasant and our food arrived in a timely manner.  Our only complaint was that the air conditioner was probably set to 40 degrees or something since it was 90+ degrees out and the temperature difference was so drastic that it made it hard to enjoy the environment."}
{"text":"I really like that they Skinnylicious Menu.  It's basically the original menu but with half the calories. I ordered a skinny cosmo cocktail and skinny turkey avocado sandwich that came with a side salad. The cosmo was perfect but the sandwich and salad was okay. It was pretty bland. I'll have to try something else from the skinnylicious menu when i go next time."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of large restaurant chains like The Cheesecake Factory, so it really takes a lot to wow me.

That being said - this place is okay. The menu is extensive so there's something for everyone, however, since they don't exactly have a specialty, all the entrees come across as bland. My sliders we soggy and several of the other appetizers we tried were average at best.

Big surprise - the cheesecake is good. 

Pro tip: Grab dinner at one of the other restaurants in the Biltmore area and reserve The Cheesecake Factory for dessert."}
{"text":"All around an awesome choice! 
I wanted to take my little sister out because she was in town and she wanted the Cheesecake Factory. Our waiter was patient, helpful, and just had great customer service. Hosts were friendly coming and out. Each dish was prepared correctly and was just fantastic! Of course we had to get cheesecake after! 
I love the this place, Can't wait to be back! (:"}
{"text":"Pathetic \"specialty\" Fish & Chips to go order on 1/12/17! $18 WASTED! Not even a busy night or weekend. I'll cook next time or go to BJ's!"}
{"text":"Poorly trained staff, rude management. An hour and half later thank god Chick-Fil-et is across the street."}
{"text":"Started by walking out of trying to get seated at Kona Grill. Host staff was rude at Kona Grill. Walked out and went to Cheese Cake Factory met by friendly host staff, seated immediately, had great service by Nathan our waiter. Food was hot and fresh. My son didn't like his spaghetti and Meatball but he is 12 and sent it back Nathan was more than accommodating to make my son happy. KONA GRILL Thank for not having space to seat us."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Portions are a little much, so me and my husband both tried items and drinks off the SkinnyLicious menu.
Enchiladas were awesome! perfect portion size!
Cobb salad was good, nothing extraordinary.
Skinny Long Islands were very tasty!
Service was really nice, she walked us through the menu and warned us that the portion sizes were smaller."}
{"text":"The timing and the location was perfect.  My wife and I celebrated our 17th anniversary and wanted late dinner.  This location was close to our hotel.  The service was great as we were immediately seated on the patio (we arrived at 10PM on a Sunday evening...closing time was 11PM).  Our server, Jessica was took our drink order shortly after we sat down.  I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and Chicken combo.  I wanted to try something new and I thought it was a great choice.  I loved the appearance of the plate and the food was outstanding.  I didn't like the mango salsa though.  My wife loves this dish and raves about the salsa.  For me, I the salsa didn't work but everything else did.  The bean and rice were good especially when I mixed it with the chicken and shrimp.  Overall, I give this place four stars...the staff were friendly and checked with us several times during our visit.  If I visit this area in Las Vegas again, I would consider visiting this establishment again.  Oh and the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake is to die for.  What a way to end an evening."}
{"text":"Went at 11am to get a buzzer for their 1130am opening time since we did not want to line up.  Restaurant was really busy from the start.  Service was ok.  Food took a while to come out.  Some of our food came out hot but others were no longer hot.  I'm assuming they wait for all food orders from our table to be ready then they bring them all out.  The four cheese pasta was so so. I won't order it again.  There's better pasta options from previous times I've eaten in the states."}
{"text":"This might be the branch that has the RUDEST employees! So we just wanted to have a happy family dinner and when we entered there was a waiting list, so we checked in and the front desk said we have to wait for 40 minutes and we said \"Ok, thank you.\" Then we sat down on a couch that is near to the front desk so we can hear them if they call us. 
    
     A while later, we asked how many more minutes do we have to wait and this guy told us that we're gonna be called next because we were in front of the line. A few minutes, we still weren't called. So we told another guy that 40 minutes passed already and we haven't been called, so he checked in the computer he said that we've been called 10 times! We were like \"We didn't get called at all!\" We were so near to the front desk and we know we didn't get called. 

     So we went to the manager and he got us a table and he said that it was no big deal. But it was a big deal, they were lying and unfair because we were a party of 5 and they called parties of 6 ,7, 4. They said that we weren't called just yet because our party was more than a party of 4! They were being unfair and dishonest. I hope my experience help you when you come to this branch."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant's no matter where they are they have good food but today was the worst experience i ever had
Food 5*
Service -1*
The waiter and the manager where not for that job,they knew nothing about how to treat people."}
{"text":"This is one of the best of theyre huge nr of locations.
Service not that good for the price and comparisons.
But the food is always good.Will go again."}
{"text":"Love the food here & usually a great time. Unfortunately, when we went to change our reservation & the hostess said she would hold the name for an hour while we gathered a larger party. When we returned the hostess gave a massive attitude while informing us that they do not hold reservations , something she didn't feel the need to tell us before we decided to return in an hour. Unpleasant experience from a usually excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Great lunch!  Food was very good (crusted chicken Romano and a mushroom burger) but waitress Chayle was great! We will come back just to have her wait on us again!"}
{"text":"We love Cheesecake Factory! We make it a point to stop in here for lunch anytime we are leaving Charlotte to go home to Columbia. Today we had a great experience! 

We started with Tuna Tartare, which was beautifully presented and very fresh. We loved it, and it was a nice diversion from some of their \"not so healthy\" appetizers. For lunch, I ordered my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the S.O. ordered teriyaki chicken. Both were excellent! Our server was awesome and we really had a great lunch with several drinks. We don't love corporate places, but this place is an exception to that rule!"}
{"text":"Very very good food and ofcourse cheesecake, the prices are well worth the food and service. We enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"The food here is good however EVERY single time I order take out they butcher the order.  Just got home with a chicken salad that has no chicken in it.  I guess it's my fault for not checking the order but we did curbside and it was dark out and it hard to open everything in the car.  We also tipped $8.  It's so aggravating."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my boyfriend. It was nice except the wait time. The bread is good, my boyfriend order chicken and I order angel hair with garlic cream sauce.  And I had red velvet cheese cake. I like the experience"}
{"text":"Been a Cheesecake Factory fan for awhile. Normally get the Jambalaya but decided to break the routine and ordered a salad.  Very large and very good and still had room for the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake.  Wait is always somewhat of an issue and there were open tables with no one at them, when I arrived."}
{"text":"Ok so yes it is a little bit pricy but ohhhhh baby it's good. the menu is absolutely huge don't think I have ever seen such a big one no matter who you with and how picky they are they will find something so there's three menus one very large one , a size normal one that focuses on lower calories , and of course the specials,  then let's not forget the deserts and it's not just cheese cakes . i have been to the cheese cake factory many of time and have never had a bad meal. Service is great it's clean and well decorated oops let's not forget the  nice and clean bathrooms,whoop,whoop gotta love that
Sorry no pics dug in to quickly"}
{"text":"Knowing Cheesecake Factory, I personally try to steer away because of their food. Don't get me wrong. Their foods are mostly good but they also pack a punch in calories. So I was surprised when along with their regular menu, we were given a \"Skinnylicous\" one. It was so exciting! They listed all their food options and most of them are below 600 calories! Score!

We ordered appetizers and I settled with the Skinnylicious burger. It was surprisingly good! You would think that something like that would be more than 600 calories at least. I am really glad that they have this option available. I might consider dining here again if I'm in the area and not be scared that I have no other options but unhealthy ones."}
{"text":"Table 92  Server: Clayton H
Decided to take my two kids for dessert, started off ok.
All we ordered was a chocolate milk, a coffee, 3 waters and two slices of cheesecake.  After waiting about 13 minutes, we get our water, chocolate milk and coffee.   ...he brought creamer but no sugar and walked away.  After about 5 minutes I managed to flag him down and ask for sugar...took about another 5 minutes to get that.  Coffee was cold.  Tried to flag him down but would pass our table quite quickly, finally got his attention and said it would be about 5 minutes there was a new pot of coffee brewing...so now we've been sitting close to 30 minutes and STILL have no cheesecake, my daughter is done with her chocolate milk and I'm still waiting for my coffee...  he now comes out with my coffee and no creamer, I ask for creamer...when he comes back with the creamer...he plops it down on the table and states, \"are you okay ma'am, you don't seem okay?\"  I tried to give him the short version of this and his response was, well i'm sorry but as you can see I'm very busy....i state...but all we ordered is cheesecake and after 30 minutes we STILL don't have that.   It was fairly uncomfortable...what was supposed to be a treat for my kids and I turned into this uncomfortable, unnecessarily frustrating situation."}
{"text":"Can't really review the food, but the hostesses in the two nights we TRIED to go hear were awful!!

First time didn't expect an hour wait & the hostesses were not polite about the wait.  

The second time we expected to wait an hour for a table, not wait an hour to talk to a hostess.  When we approached the hostess stand to put our name down, 3 young ladies standing there , 2 doing nothing.   I asked one girl (that was not doing anything) how long the wait was, she pointed to the girl doing something, and said ask her.  I tried multiple times to ask the other girl, but she ignored me.  Even when she was doing nothing she continued to ignore. 

We left the second time & debating if there will ever be a third. 

Did finally make it back, but doubt a return.  $150 for 5 people for burgers & 3 pieces of OK cheesecake.  No alcohol!  Food was ok, great service though. Not worth the hassle for the $$"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped on Valentine's Day to pick up a slice of cheese cake for our dessert. I got Adam's peanut butter .  So disappointed in the size ! It looked nothing like the one displayed in the case !  About half the size! My husband's slice was small also .This is horrible! They must cut pieces from another cake in another case. Think twice about ordering a slice to go from this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Went for dinner after my cousin's graduation. We had a party of 16 and they were very accommodating. We had two servers and they were both very good. Everything came out promptly and they kept our tables clean and drinks full. Food was great which I have come to expect from Cheesecake Factory. Everyone enjoyed their food and of course most of us took cheesecake to go. Our one server (Mike?) was a riot, he felt like one of the gang and I'm sure we drove him a little nuts with how big our group was, but he was awesome! Thanks for another great dining experience Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory. This wasn't my first time here and won't be my last. Everyone is always so nice and the food is always so good. I highly recommend this place for any type of occasions. S'mores cheesecake is one of the best cheesecakes hands down !!"}
{"text":"Food was just okay. The shrimp was overdone and not the proper size for a entree dish. The server Patrick B. was one of the worse servers I had in a very long time.   Had no people skills and did not know the menu."}
{"text":"I rated it 5 stars, but there is one problem- their menu is so big that I have trouble making decisions!

Regardless, I have never been disappointed there. I always try something different. Usually their salads. Not only are they huge portion sizes but they are always delicious.

Drink specials are great. I love their sangria.

The ambiance is nice. It is a huge restaurant and the booths allow you space to not feel overcrowded.

Moving on to the best part- the cheesecake!! It is a must when going here. So many different kinds to choose from. My favorite is the original. But I like the Pumpkin seasonal one as well.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Today was the first bad meal and customer service experience I've experienced at any cheesecake factory. I had my usual dish of cajun jumbalaya pasta and it was obvious my portions were reduced and the care taken to prepare the dish was not evident.  The usual food presentation was gone.  My rasberry lemonade was awful.  They have even decreases the portions for cheesecake as well.  Lastly our waitress was very slow. We will not be eating at this particular
 cheesecake factory in the future."}
{"text":"It's ok. Desert is great. Italian pasta suck. Bread is good."}
{"text":"Update 7/25/16....I am pleased that the manager, James, has taken responsibility for what happened. I will go back and give them another chance. As I said, the food was delicious and I love their cheesecake.  He admitted that there was a failure on many levels and is taking steps to address them all. Taking responsibility and taking action is all I can ask. Raising to 3 stars for all the reasons I listed.

UPDATE: 7/18/16..I MISSED A CALL FROM THE MANAGER, JAMES, AND WHEN I CALLED BACK AT 5:59 PM I WAS PUT ON HOLD FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE 3RD PERSON TO HANDLE MY CALL TOLD ME HE LEFT 15 MIN AGO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? HOW DID THE 1ST PERSON PUT ME ON HOLD FOR 6 MINUTES IF HE WAS ALREADY GONE? I CAN'T EVEN STAND BY 2 STARS. THEY GET 1 STAR FOR THE FOOD BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT IS HORRIBLE!

I ordered a to-go order on the phone and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I got there about 17 minutes after my call. I stood for a good 5-10 minutes just waiting for help. When someone finally appeared she pulled up my order and gave me the total and then got told by someone else behind the counter that the person standing next to me was waiting first. That person was standing there when I got there and was only waiting on a cheesecake to go. Not a complicated order (didn't require the kitchen) and she had to have been waiting at least 15-20 minutes.  My order took about 30 minutes. I ordered a burrito with extra sour cream and guacamole so when they showed me a container with visible sour cream I figured that was the extra. When I got home, however, it turns out the there was NO sour cream or guacamole on or around the burrito. The \"extra\" I ordered was less than what would have come with the burrito let alone constitute anything near the \"extra\" I paid for. There was no guacamole at all with or for the burrito. The food is good (why I gave 2 stars) but the service was absolutely horrible!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a salad that you know will not be overpriced. The salad I ordered was very healthy and huge. It was piled up like a volcano and it was fun to eat my way through the various layers. The flavours seemed to work together.

The price was fair and the margaritas were well priced and yummy. I was satisfied with the value for the money for the dish I ordered. 

The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go if you know what dishes you like. It's not an exotic or creative menu but pretty consistent in quality, value and delivery based on my experience."}
{"text":"I really like this Cheesecake Factory compared to some other locations I have been to in California.  I have had excellent experiences both with to-go and dine-in.  Kaitlin is the best to-go specialist!  She always makes sure I have what I ordered and makes sure to go through my order before I leave with it.  Joe is the server I had the last time I dined in the restaurant and he was wonderful.  I recently had to adopt a special diet and Joe really took the time to review what would work best for me.  After being a corporate trainer in the restaurant industry for several years I can honestly say both Kaitlin and Joe are great representatives of why this place is so good.  The food can only take you so far, but having a staff who does a great job and treats the customers well will bring people back for a long time to come."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible!!! The bathrooms smelled like your 1980's gas station bathroom. We were told the wait would be a half hour, so we went to some other shops and came back after a half hour, when we got back we were told it would be another 15 minutes, so we waited, and waited, so after 15 minutes we asked, and they said \"oh, it's going to be another 15 minutes\"!!! What the heck is this place, a comedy club! Some of the staff was rude. I would love a reply for this! But just don't come here!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with about 10-15 people for my friends birthday dinner on Friday night. We did attempt to make a reservation but I guess they don't take reservations after 5pm... Anyways when we walked in the hostesses told us it would be about 15 minutes for a table and we ended up waiting 50 minutes!!! After we sat, we weren't greeted by a server for about 15 more minutes... I ended up going to the front to order food to go because we waited an hour and a half and still the waiter didn't take our order. Management was not helpful at all.. Horrible horrible experience"}
{"text":"As a tourist to a foreign land, one quite often uses Hollywood as a platform for whether it be tourist attractions, product endorsements and/or lifestyle changes. When it comes to eating, everyone from outside the United States would love to get served by Penny from the Big Bang Theory, which bought me to this little establishment about 4 years ago & keep returning annually when I revisit the States. 

Situated in the Caesars Palace forum mall, the Cheesecake Factory is located right at the end of the mall, right next to the huge fish tank. I somehow always end up with seating outside looking at the fish tank, which is fine by me as it is an alright view. 

The service can be a little slow at times, but generally is pretty good. The quality of the food is great, and overwhelmingly large, however you come to expect that here. Just make sure that you leave a little room for dessert. 

PS. The chicken Bellagio is probably better here than anywhere else in the country - as freaky as that sounds, it is true..."}
{"text":"In all our years, neither my husband nor myself have ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. So when my coworker gave me a giftcard, we decided to treat ourselves.

Upon entering the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how busy it was. We had to yell just to hear each other. This was on a Thursday around 6:30 pm. I would hate to see how packed it gets on a Saturday.

We were seated after a short wait at a part booth/ part table. My husband took the booth side, and I sat in the uncomfortable and not-so-fat-friendly chair across from him. Halfway through the dinner service I moved to the booth with my husband because my butt was going numb. It's hilarious to me to think that a restaurant that serves food like a macaroni and cheese hamburger would use chairs that only a child or Victoria Beckham could fit into.

My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the chicken penne. We were surprised how huge the servings were, and ended up taking half our food home with us. Next time we will probably just share an entrée. Overall, the food was really delicious, which says a lot considering I'm generally a pretty picky eater. We ordered three cheesecake slices to go because we couldn't decide on which one we wanted to try the most. We ordered the red velvet, white chocolate raspberry, and the Reeses peanut butter cup. The Reeses we didn't care for. The red velvet was just okay. But the white chocolate raspberry was AH-MAZING.

We didn't care much for our waiter. He hardly spoke to us the entire time we were there. I believe the only time he spoke was when we were ordering, which was minimal. The rest of the time he kind of just ignored us and the rest of his tables, and stood there looking at himself in a mirror or talking to the other waiters.

Overall, we will still go back, not because of the service, but because of the food."}
{"text":"Two hour wait for a table followed by a one hour wait for food. Never again. Food was good but not three hours wait worthy.

I'm not sure what's wrong and nothing against the server either. He was great but man your kitchen sucks. You've been open for more than a month. Get your shit together."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food here. Enjoy the food very much. We got a surprise offer for a free slice of cheesecake on next purchase."}
{"text":"The food was so amazing. There was an issue with one of the appetizers, but the manager was kind enough to come out and speak to us about it. He apologized for it and was generous enough to take care of it. Overall my sister and I had an amazing date and we will definitely be back! Great service and great experience!!"}
{"text":"Heerlijk gegeten weer hier. De meest uitgebreide kaart die je je maar kunt bedenken met alleen maar pareltjes van gerechten. Kwalitatief hoogstaand. Zal aantal foto's plaatsen van favoriete gerechten"}
{"text":"I've been to Cheesecake Factory about six times, about three of them at this location. I'm not much of a fan of chain restaurants, but I must say the decor and ambiance have been nice and the restaurant always clean. 

On a past visit I had a Buffalo Chicken sandwich which is no longer on the menu...and probably with good reason. It was the sort of quality I'd expect from a fast food drive-thru, only a larger portion and served on a plate. This time, I had the Cuban Sandwich with a Green Salad side. The sandwich wasn't bad, just not memorable. The portion was plenty for lunch and some to take home. My friend had the equivalent of Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti (don't see it currently listed on their website menu) which he downed in no time, despite the large portion. At the server's recommendation, we shared the Hershey®'s Chocolate Bar Cheesecake, which was fresh and flavorful. 

The second server (the first one's shift had ended) was late in bringing some water I'd asked for. While I wasn't concerned about it, he noticed his own service was too slow and he promised to \"make it up\" to me. Not sure what that meant and I never saw any benefit. 

While the portions were more than ample, I'm not sure the prices are in line for the quality being offered. Two lunch entrees with nonalcoholic beverages and one dessert came to about $50.00. For the money, I would've preferred to go elsewhere. 

I will say I've stopped by the carry out counter for cheesecake to go before and absolutely LOVE the Lemon Raspberry and will always consider it a \"go-to option to-go\"!!!"}
{"text":"I don't dislike Cheesecake Factory...but when I ate there this time, it finally occurred to me that Cheesecake Factory is just a really big Applebee's."}
{"text":"Started with the Thai lettuce wraps, which I always do when I'm here. Had the blackened shrimp and chicken which was very good . Very little on the plate though. I tried their cheesecake for the first time. That changed my perception of cheesecake because what I've tried before(not here)I never liked it. only real problem I had was the waiter took so long to come back with my cheesecake and check. My meter expired and I got a $25 ticket"}
{"text":"i rarely ever take the time to write reviews, but this experience was so bad. i came here with my mom, grandparents & bf. i came here to celebrate dinner after i graduated cosmetology school. the only reason why i come here is for the french dip which i noticed they took off the menu so i asked our waitress, DEE, about it. she has the most ugly attitude and a horrible personality. she was RUDE every chance she got, making snide remarks like \"oh i'll just reach over all of you to grab this one plate\", throwing the bags for our boxes AT us. she was the most unpleasant person to be around, i almost asked for the manager and for a new waitress. If any of you get Dee as your next waitress, immediately ask for someone else. her attitude ruined my whole dinner. at least my food was good."}
{"text":"First off I am not a fan of Cheesecake Factory. I love Grand Lux and even though they are owned by the same parent company there is a huge difference. We ended up eating here for a work dinner and I must say I was surprised.  For the very first time I actually like my food and loved the service. We ordered chicken poppers and calamari for apps. Then I had the chicken pasta with sun dried tomatoes. Someone else ordered the jambalaya and one other guy orders the Cajun chicken. To our surprise we gave the food was B+ compared to D- in the past. I'm glad we have it another shot and now we will reconsider going back. Great job!"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this Cheesecake Factory!!  We came here because we were meeting friends from Germany, and they don't have any Cheesecake Factories there (sucks to be them!!!) so they wanted to meet up at one here.  Fine by me!!

We met friends here for dinner at 8 on a Sunday night.  There was about a 10 minute wait, if that.  They seated us even though all of our party wasn't there--two of them were on European time.  It gave us plenty of time to enjoy our first round of drinks and to peruse the 87 page menu (only a slight exaggeration).

Our waitress was extremely patient and accomodating considering we were there for over 2 hours.  She was extremely attentive and kept asking us if we needed refills on anything and was great with the suggestions when we were debating about what to get.

My husband got some sort of amazing breakfast burrito that was twice the size of his head.  And he ate every bite of it, too (minus what I stole!)  My friend and I split the tuna carpaccio and the bang bang shrimp.  I also ordered a delicious side salad when their house dressing.  AMAZING.

Overall, it was a great experience, and I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I had the steak tacos and my cohort had the fish tacos.  Both were amazing!!!! I always try a deferent cheesecake so this time I chose the tirimasu cheesecake... meh there's better options."}
{"text":"Love the carrot cake cheesecake and white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, they're phenomenal! I also love where this place is located.., i almost gave it five stars but every time is go, the service is a little slow and the waiters are respectful but not exactly \"friendly\" (hope that made sense) .. Other than that, I always get exactly what I order and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I am not big on chain restaurants but this place is an exception.  Everything that I order is always really good.  This particular location is a bit smaller than most locations that I am used to and was packed.  We got in right after it opened so we did not have to wait but on our way out, there was a line out the door."}
{"text":"Will never be back.  When you spend $200 for dinner you expect at the very least a semi decent meal/experience."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. I was expecting a bit of a wait for Vegas, but we literally waited 5 minutes. Spaghetti and meatballs were delicious as well as the lemon raspberry cheesecake."}
{"text":"Great Food always, but can be a pain for long waits on getting seated as well as waiting for food.  Wish they'd stay on top of drink refills more, but their staff is usually younger and learning how to be a waiter/waitress usually."}
{"text":"Good place with reasonable prices. Had the BBQ burger which was good and the sweet potato fries were really good as well... Being in the mall this place is definitely a good alternative."}
{"text":"I've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times before and have never received service so poor. Our server was Laura S. To start out we sat there without being prompted with any drinks for a good 6 minutes. Yes this seems petty but I work in a restaurant too and no customer sits there that long without drinks. She had managed to get to everyone else in her section before even coming back to ask us what drinks we wanted...which after we told her what we wanted she went back to talking for quite some time before we got them. To continue we asked for bread when we gave her our order for food and we didn't get it until after our appetizer arrived because it was in the oven....fine it was in the oven but she couldn't have came over while we were waiting for the bread/appetizer to come and tell us it was being made for us and it would be second? We had waved down another server while we were sitting there waiting and she \"went to go check on the bread\" but seems to me she just went and gossiped to Laura given that when Laura came back she was nothing but rude about where the bread was. Terrible tone of voice and everything. When food was ready she brought one plate out then like 5 minutes later the second plate and another minute or two later the last persons plate....normally you bring it all out at once.. After her rudeness about the bread she continued to have an attitude about God knows what and didn't even make eye contact or anything during any conversation...including \"have a nice day\" she just looked out the window.......great food as always but wow this service was absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Home away from home! Cheesecake factory of Las Vegas vs Cheesecake Factory of San Francisco! All I can say is, you can't go wrong w/Cheesecake Factory ppl! If I had a tail, it would have been wagging! LOL Ok although the room temp was on the chilly side, MAYBE that's why the bread was on the hard side. But I MUST say yuuumy on all that was ordered today! Along w/the sweet, warm & very professional service from our server ( & I HUMBLY appologize on somewhat forgetting his name, probably due to the fact of the well made 3 Flying Gorilla's & 1 Pineapple Mojito we ordered for starters) Marvin/Marty/Mark/Mario? Bravo! Because of your welcoming service, well worth of a return visit!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what is going on or what has changed with CheeseCake Factory, but the food and service has become subpar. We ordered appetizers and a salad....EVERYTHING was warm....to include the salad and dressing! This used to be one of my favorite places to eat....I'll just stick to the cheesecake from now on."}
{"text":"No matter where or when this restaurant is always great for a simple meal. Something for every mood on the menu and everything is always good. 
You can be as healthy or glutinous here. It's all there."}
{"text":"I love the skinnylicius menu. Very tasty, reasonably priced, outdoor seating rocks. Very noisy inside and difficult parking. I've never had a food transportation specialist that is attentive to all and everything. They seem to be forgetful. I have to remind them of my request."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly Bartender.  Jeremy was Awesome and he was a cutie-patootie! Was patient for our order... And quick to check and make sure we were doing good and enjoying our experience."}
{"text":"When it became the law to post nutritional information on menus, my friend told me that his favorite meal at Cheesecake Factory was 2100 calories and I haven't been back to Cheesecake Factory since... Until now.

We were away from home, staying at a nearby hotel for the weekend, for a friend's wedding and decided to eat here for lunch.

I ordered the sesame soy Ahi Tuna appetizer and shared a slice of the Mango Lime cheesecake with 2 other friends.  The Ahi Tuna was waaay too salty.. it was hard to finish... Good thing the portion was small.  If it weren't so salty, it would have been delicious!  The Mango Lime cheesecake was excellent. Not too dense.  Sweet and tart, and jam packed with Mango flavor. Loved it."}
{"text":"Yep I'm a regular here!  Yesterday had lunch with 4 other friends.  This time I enjoyed a simple two egg brakfast for lunch.  Wow somebody actaully knows how to make egss over medium correctly!  Add to that nice hash browns and a freshly baked english muffin and for $6.95?  Try to top THAT IHOP!"}
{"text":"5 star overall. I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factory locations, close to 100 visits before I started to yelp and all are constantly impressive. 

Besides the occasional blip when they are super busy the service is great. 
Refill drinks often. 
Knowledgeable about the large menu. 
Never rushing.
Fast to seat, serve, and bus tables. 
Almost always a nice greeter and server. 
To go or pick up works well at most locations.

Food is just consistently great.
Huge portions.
Huge selection. 
Healthy options and nicer options to suit anyone. 

I'll be back often. Check them out, enjoy!"}
{"text":"So, my best friend wanted to treat me to lunch. We went for kind of a late lunch to just hang out and catch up. When we arrived, there was no wait to be seated but we did have to wait about five minutes before being approached by a waiter. We ordered our beverages and when she came back we ordered an appetizer to share (the crab cakes). When the came out, the looked delicious but I cannot say that they tasted the same. I know that the seafood in the desert is not nearly as fresh or delicious as if you are closer to the shore, but I've still had decent seafood here in AZ and this is not it. Then we ordered our entrees but for some reason ended up waiting a very long time for the food to come out. from the time we sat down until the time our food came out, it had been 45 minutes! What?!?! Come on, I mean there is no excuse for that, is there? And when the food did arrive, her sandwich was kind of a mess and my food was kind of bland. Oh well, what do you expect from a chain restaurant the has a novel for a menu because they cannot decide what type of food they should have...so they try to have it all..."}
{"text":"If you are already at the mall, you should go to Cow Fish or another restaurant near by, but if you are set on the Cheesecake Factory.. The menu is giant so even the pickiest of your friends will be able to find something. Desserts are always good. The service is always sub-par and you should expect to wait over an hour on weekends just to get a table. We have tried getting takeout during the week and it still took a long time even when no one was there. The three workers at the dessert bar were talking in the back room or texting on their phones. I decreased my review after Cheesecake told me to try going in the morning or later in the evening. Cheesecake should work on hiring more employees or training them better."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. Professional staff, great atmosphere and delicious food! I use to think the menu (roughly 8+ pages) and variety of cuisines was too much but that's gone out the window. Whenever I'm indecisive on what I'm craving, I'll go here and have a great selection. They even have a skinny licious menu if your cutting down on calories!

I have to commend the all around service you get here. Very professional! The servers have years of experience and it shows. The GM, Chad, is awesome and is always a pleasure to see. 

What I like and recommend...

Appetizers: stuffed mushrooms, chicken samosas, crab bites, and the ahi carpaccio.

Entrees:  hibachi steak, Jamaican black pepper shrimp, miso salmon, French dip and Evelyn's favorite pasta! 

Dessert: chocolate chip cookie dough, pumpkin cheesecake and the salted caramel."}
{"text":"Usually I love the Cheesecake Factory - have been to multiple locations in the States (San Francisco, Buffalo) 

We were very excited to see they've opened at Yorkdale Mall. We received a buzzer and had a wait for about 3.5 hours, which I understand it's a busy time and everyone is excited for it's opening. 

Shortly after sitting, we noticed all the cutlery on our table had dried up/older food on it and was extremely dirty..

We had also waited this absurd amount of time just for a lunch as we really love the Cheesecake Factory chicken wings.. only to learn that they ran out? Did not expect this at such a big and popular restaurant and all while they are very well aware they have a gigantic lineup for their food."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove over 30 minutes to eat at this restaurant. We were seated fairly quickly. The Potstickers we good. My husband entree, Steak Diane was delicious. However, my Chicken Marsala was so dry...very dry! I couldn't taste the Marsala at all. It seemed to not have any seasoning whatsoever. The butterfly noodles used for this entree was a horrible choice. As it dried all of the seasoning. Just gross! Will never order that entree again!!!"}
{"text":"Have not been to Cheesecake Factory in several years. I got a $50 gift card from my family for Christmas. Soooo today i used it. THE BEST MEAL!  Started with a Martini no vermouth.  To appetizer of Dynamite shrimp. Delicious. Crisp batter, light but spicy-creamy dipping sauce.  With the main course of medium rare Hibachi steak with mushroom wine sauce.  This is the first time to the Crocker Park venue. I have been to other CF stores and did not have the same quality. Please people. Steak is not meant to be eaten well done. A diner next to me had a well done steak and she could hardly cut it. My steak was tender, delicious and easy to cut. At the very least do not order more than a medium. I gave this restaurant a 5 star for friendly staff and a great meal."}
{"text":"Standard CCF operation with super over whelming menu.  I get a huge headache after looking at everything.  Do i want one of their 20 salads, 20 burgers, 20 sandwiches, 50 apps?  You get the point.  There are hundreds of items on the menu.

I guess it's a \"safe\" option to take someone b/c you can find something for everyone.  The service was pretty slow on a Thurs late night.  Overall this location is what you would expect from Cheesecake.  The desserts are obv awesome and I like the firecracker salmon app."}
{"text":"On of my favorite places to go on a date night...first you start out with brown wheat bread and a loaf of white bread . The menu is HUGE and can be a lot or  a little bit intimidating to say the least. We always start with the fried macaroni and cheese balls over a creamy tomato sauce. Also, we get the green corn tamale cakes . Both are excellent! Usually for or main dinner we get the chicken parm, the herb crusted salmon and mashed potatoes , and the orange chicken. The portions are huge and unless you are starving or split an entree you are most likely taking home leftovers. Don't forget to save room for their outstanding cheesecakes. I have tried a lot of them and all are superb. My favorite is the 30th anniversary cake, and my girlfriends favorite is the black tuxedo cheesecake and the funfetti one (this one was seasonal)."}
{"text":"Overpriced dinners for average food with huge calorie meals ranging from 1300 to 2200 calories.  Add another 1200 calories if you want a slice of their specialty.  Decor is dated.  Only real positive was the service of our waitress.  For the same price, better off going to Tommy Bahama or True Foods across the street."}
{"text":"I like the Cheesecake factory.  It is always good for a substantial, good meal.  Is it phenomenal, no?  Is it bad, no. It's good and for the most part, consistent.

We came in around 8 pm on a Tuesday night so needless to say, it was pretty quiet.  There were lots of servers standing around so when it came to get my iced tea refreshed, I was surprised I had to track someone down.  The bartender, who was also our server, was engrossed in a convo with a male customer (perhaps she thought he'd be a better tipper? ;) ) so we were invisible to her.  Too bad too, as she seemed promising.

One of my staple dishes I get at the Cheesecake Factory is the Tomato Basil pasta.  It is always an ample serving that I can usually get 2 meals out of.  I also love a good old slice of Original Cheesecake.  Keep it simple and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a really good meal at this Cheesecake Factory last night.  We went with a large group of ten and our server did a FANTASTIC job of being attentive and keeping everything straight; even keeping track of 4 different checks without a hitch.  I had the miso salmon which I tend to enjoy at most Cheesecake Factorys but last nights was especially good.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Most of our party enjoyed their meals.  There was a small hiccup when one of our meals had what looked like brillo in it but it turned out to be charred corn silk.  The server and manager were very professional and took care of it by quickly expediting a new one as well as taking it off the bill.  Other than that, another good time and meal at the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but I hate dining there. I hate restaurants that are so loud that I can't talk to the person sitting in front or next to me. Plus the tables are way to close together so it feels like I am sitting with strangers. But I know that going into the restaurant, that is why I LOVE the take out option. The food is always hot by the time that I get home so there is no lack of heat or anything like that. It's almost as if I am eating there in the restaurant with the temperature and etc.

The food is always on point.

Food

Chicken Samosas - 5 Stars - Full of Flavor, Nice Portion size, Sauce is to die for.

Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls - 3.5 Stars - The filling needs more seasoning before being wrapped in the rice paper. The sauces can only go so far in seasoning the rolls.

Bread - 5 Star plus - Enjoy the 9 grain bread the most.

Shrimp & Bacon Club - 5 Stars - Love the bacon, shrimp and the sauce. I don't put tomatoes on the sandwich but sub onions and the flavor is so much better. 

Fries - Always seasoned wel. Sometimes a little too well.

Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake - 5 Stars

Peanut Butter Cheesecake - 5 Stars

If if wasn't for the take out option I would never dine there. The few times that I have dined in there were no problems. Servers are friendly and helpful. Just not my kind of atmosphere."}
{"text":"There was so much hype around the opening of Cheesecake Factory in Toronto, and then to hear that one needed to wait 3+ hours to be seated was so ridiculous that I vowed to stay away until the hype died down. However I recently found myself at Yorkdale on a Friday morning with my family thus it seemed like less of a long shot to try dining there for lunch.

We lined up for a short while to put our names on the list to be seated, and were given a pager and an approximate time to return. However we returned at 11:45am as we had been instructed and still had to wait another 25 minutes to finally be seated. Even once seated, it took a while to get the attention of our server, who kept disappearing for long intervals of time despite us telling her up front that we were pressed for time. Thankfully we were served the complimentary two types of bread which helped us fill our stomachs a bit while waiting for our food.

We ordered a pasta, fish tacos, and two cheesecake slices (dessert to go). The food took a while to come out. The pasta was tasty and had a bit of a kick to it. The fish tacos were oily and had too many pickled onions that overwhelmed the flavour of everything else I was eating. The tacos were served with what seemed like a random serving of rice on the side. 

Although we didn't have the cheesecake until later on at home, I must admit that we enjoyed the dulce de leche cheesecake as well as the coffee cheesecake. I appreciated the packaging which had a special compartment for the cheesecake slice which kept it in place during transit.

I would try Cheesecake Factory again but was very disappointed with the service during this first visit. I would recommend coming early and getting a pager then doing your shopping while you wait to be seated. I also recommend dining here when you're not in a rush to be anywhere else. 2.75 stars."}
{"text":"I would like to start off this review by saying the initial wait time to get into the restaurant is not reflected in the rating. That is completely expected considering the amount of hype that this place has at the moment. 

The host that seated us at our table was very fun and energetic which I had hoped would be a great start to a great experience for the night. Unfortunately, from the moment he left, the whole thing went downhill. The bread and water was brought to us 35 minutes after being seated. When being asked about what drinks we wanted when first being seated, our drinks and meals were ordered. It took an additional 30 minutes to receive 3 alcoholic beverages, which I had to ask the server what the status was on the drinks. That was 1 hour to receive a mojito. 

It would have probably be a good time to see that as a warning but unfortunately we made the mistake of not cancelling our food order. 1.5 hours after being seated, our food came to the table. Now, while I must admit, the pasta dishes have a good portion size, I can assure you the steak Diane/ shrimp scampi combination meal ($30) is the furthest thing from a good portion size. You get 4 toonie sized pieces of steak, 3 shrimp and some mashed potatoes. The steak I ordered rare, somehow came served well done and tough. 

After everyone completed their unsatisfying meal, we requested the cheesecake since it was the main reason we came here. Normally a slice of cake should take about 10 minutes to serve but somehow it took an additional 25 minutes to come to the table. This table was also not cleared until after we requested it to be cleared. 

All in all, the dining experience took about 2.5 hours from start to finish. Anyone that has experienced this restaurant south of the border knows that this is not how the dining experience should be. I would recommend taking the cheesecake to go, and then walking over to the food court and getting a burrito bowl from chipotle and patting yourself on the back for spending 25 dollars less for more food.

Started at 9 pm on a Thursday and walked out at 11:30 pm."}
{"text":"We have been going to Cheesecake Factory in the US for a long time - more than 15 years.  We first discovered it a long time ago in Vegas.

Waited til the hype is done because we are not the type to wait more than one hour for food.

We were at Yorkdale today and decided to order my daughter's favourite pasta Da Vinci for take out.  Excited since we would not have to wait in line for table.

We specifically asked for non-lunch portion.  When we picked up the food, was a little surprised cost was $27 but it's our favorite so we didn't mind.

When we brought the food home, we were very surprised to see how small the portion was.  The pasta was one layer flat and did not even cover half of the container.  

There is no way we got a regular portion of pasta since we just had the same dish last month in Buffalo.

Lesson learned:  next time we should open our container and check our food before leaving the restaurant.

Although I doubt we would ever visit the restaurant again in TO."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is the best. Of course the cheesecake is the best and the nachos are delicious."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has upped the ante with their new lighter fare menu. I was pleased to be able to have a healthier meal here that was also free of my food allergens. The waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and made sure the chef knew my allergies prior to preparing my meal. This is seldom the case in large chain restaurants with huge menus! I was very pleasantly surprised. As for the food, my husband got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo. This was an oversized plate that they are known for, but he said it was excellent. I opted for the Turkey Avocado sandwich and a side salad. It sounds so simple but it was delicious! I was also very pleased with their fun presentation since I didn't get a bun. They made it a nice sandwich stack! I will definitely be heading back for a bite when I'm at the mall again!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am writing this review for a corporate restaurant is because at this location,  I had the best experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory.  From the service to the timing and deliciousness of each and every course, the time spent here was well worth it. Also, at the time we visited, around 4pm on a week day... there wasn't a wait."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is wonderful but the service was incredibly slow. We waited at least 15 minutes to get drinks and bread at the beginning and then we got half of our meals after what seemed like a pretty long wait. It took another ten minutes to get two more plates delivered. The final plate, however didn't arrive at our table until after we'd all finished eating. The manager did comp the seriously late plate, and it's easy to forgive a missed order but the overall slowness of the servers leads me to leave this one star review."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the cheesecake. We have had dinner there once or twice, but I found nothing negative or glowing to say about the dinners. It's always to crowded to make this place on our restaurant rotation list.  I LOVE the cheesecake. Either eat in or take out, it is such a treat! We mostly like to take the dessert out, less crowded and have it in the peace and quite of a hotel room near by or at home. I love the Raspberry/Chocolate every time ! True fan and will continue to eat Cheesecake and recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory. The best thing about this restaurant is the amount of items on their menu. They literally have something for every body. They have a Skinnylicious menu, which is what I always order from. You can order your appetizers, main course, desert, and drinks from this menu. The cheesecake is to die for and I have a couple favorite. Right now my two favorites are Vanilla Bean and Tuxedo, I'm classic with cheesecake and ice-cream. This location was nice. It's very convenient seeing that it's attached to the mall. I wouldn't come her on a dinner date due to that reason but it's perfect for after your shopping trip. A lot better than the food court! Customer service was good, nothing special but nothing bad either. Overall, I'd recommend this location for a day after shopping."}
{"text":"We love going to The Cheesecake Factory any opportunity we can. We love the food and the cheesecakes are amazing. I got the Cajun Jambalaya and my wife got the Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta. Both were wonderful and the portions were huge. For desert we each got a cheesecake to go. I got the Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake (which reminded me of German Chocolate Cake) and my wife got the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, which was simple, but tasted great."}
{"text":"The wait for was alright around 15-20 minutes on a Friday night. The bread at the beginning was really yummy. Super good food as well. The service was slow and we waited along time for the check, drinks, etc. Cheesecake is always a must!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in an out of state (California) Cheesecake Factory.  They were very nice and considering there was a concert nearby they were fairly quick.  The waitress was very nice and moved us when we told her the air was blowing freezing temperatures at us in our seats.  The place was clean and the food was good. I like the skinny food they offer, low calorie food that tastes good."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants for many reasons but I'll give an exception this time. For an appetizer I ordered the Portabella Mushroom Avocado and Zucchini Fries oh sooo good! Seriously you have to try it! For my main course meal I choose Evelyn's favorite pasta! Now I can say why it was her favorite! It's now mines too! Lol pasta was more of a vegan dish since it had 
Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Garlic and Pine Nuts. Ahh sooo good! And lastly for dessert my server suggested to try out their tiramisu cake, I enjoyed it it was full of flavor very moist and could definitely taste the coffee the only bad thing I'd say was the waiting time it took about 50 mins to be seated we were given a receipt with a check back in time. We however used that time to walk and browse around the forum shops :)"}
{"text":"These folks are starting to look as if they are worn out!  One too many smiles, one too many frowns, one too many birthday guests....One too many!  

That was my initial impression on  Tuesday evening at this location.  The hostess was kind but wasn't overly anxious to seat us.  No eagerness to see how our day had been going or how they may accommodate us past how many in our party...(felt like we were caught up in some mechanism we couldn't break out of once the service started up!)  

First the water attendant to ask if we cared for water....Then the waiter to hit us up for our booze fix question, then the bread person (alternate bus-boy), to bring us our serving of yeasty fix-ins....Followed by the timed \"Do you know what you may want for dinner?...Might I start you off with an appetizer?\"  from our waiter again....It all felt so routine an impersonal.  No eye contact, no \"how is your day going?\", No smile!  We did get---\"Shall I give you a few more minutes?\" and without us answering, our waiter was able to read our minds and turned and walked away to another table because we had wavered a slight bit in our timing to respond!-----SO IMPERSONAL!  So Ho-Humm!  If I had stabbed myself with a fork, they probably would have asked if I would like another fork?

How's about we talk about the food!  Good for I had the Hungarian Goulash, and my friend had the CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA.  Both were done right and served in a timely fashion.  And my friend's Birthday!?---Not even a mention of a birthday cupcake or anything (Quite disappointing that they offered nothing when most other places offer at least a scoop of ice creme!)...they didn't even offer though I had told them.

My over-all assessment here is ---- they need to get a clue that being at the Caesars Palace Colonnade Mall, The Cheesecake Factory is like an ambassador to the world, and they came close to getting a failing grade here tonight!"}
{"text":"I have not had every single thing on the menu, but I have had plenty of exposure to their 'Modus Operendi' ....and let me tell you, it is a FULL FIVE STARS for service, quality of food fare, location, environment (inside and out!), atmosphere (design), and the attention to detail with regards to our needs as customers.  The later being the most noticeable and appreciated.
The waiter's timing and concern for our needs was uncanny, from the moment my friend and me sat down to the moment we were ready to lean foreword and depart to other realms!
The decor is well balanced and not suffocating.  I felt a sense of privacy, yet not forgotten in the crowd...I would Highly recommend this location for any form of date or professional get-together.  rest assured that you will not have to think about arrangements for you and say up to four people...More than that, and you might want to call ahead and see that they can accommodate to your liking.

Otherwise---\"Bone-That's-Petite!\""}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment. We had an extremely poor experience on Sun 10/15. Our server forgot our bread, did not bring us appetizer plates for our appetizer, then my husband's beef was very undercooked. When reported to the server she replied that \"they won't do anything because there's less than half left\" She, herself realized this was a ridiculous statement as demonstrated when she nervously glanced at the plate which was 95% full and only a couple of bites taken. She had already passed by the table a couple of times, glanced at his plate and never once asked if his meal was ok. I ordered the same entree and also had undercooked meat but less so than my husband, however even though there was also a good portion of my meal remaining she did not ask how mine was and if I was satisfied. She proceeded to ask if we wanted dessert, then brought the dessert before clearing the dinner plates, and without fresh utensils or napkins. 
We'd have requested a manager on the spot but we were in with our daughter who is only home for the weekend and we chose to try and enjoy the remainder of the meal with her. Katelyn was our server and her service was awful and she should be coached. I will be contacting a manager tomorrow, Monday. 
What a wasted of time and money."}
{"text":"I have to just re write my review since my last one was good. I will NEVER come back here again. I just walked in for lunch the restaurant is empty and because my 2 year old is sleeping in our stroller which is not that big the blonde hostess refused to seat us. She told us we can't sit at a table and every single open seat is reserved. Regardless, that is horrible customer service. The restaurant is 90% empty. So instead of seating 3 adults and a toddler they told us they cannot help us. Thanks Cheesecake Factory every time my family comes we spend over 100.00 eating and now I never eat at any of your restaurants let alone this one again."}

{"text":"I love coming here. Not only is it a beautiful and clean restaurant, but you get so much delicious food for your money. And obviously their cheesecake is amazing!!! I don't think I've ever had a bad meal or bad service here. Just make sure to get there early or there will be a line!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Bathroom was gross. Service was okay. Spent way too much money for what it was worth."}
{"text":"I dont even know where to start...

Food should be a separate post.. truthfully! Its still delicious as i remembered from the US.

Now service is another story... horrible is the word. 1) Seating is insane, waiting 1,2,3 + hr for food is simply abnormal. Never doing this again, id happily make a reservation: next yr? No problem. 2) the guy somehow gave our bill to the couple next to us and their bill us. Ok... their bill was probably twice to 3x as much i dont know how can you miss this. Guy first didnt belive us, checked twice before going to get his coworker. We had to wait for that guy, to get another guy, and went to find a third guy before we were allowed to pay. 3) 20min waiting for the bill and watching this drama unfold was more than enough, then our original server began to argue with us because we complained and expressed frustration. Um... what?

Not impressed with cheesecake factory for the shitty experience on hubbys birthday. Obviously we wanted to save for special occation to visit and you are missing the bar. Simply disappointed, I really tried to like you."}
{"text":"oh-my-gawd, you have to come and try this!

i said i've never been to cheesecake factory, so hubby puts this on our to-do list while we're in vegas. the food - amazing! we had a massive salad thing with purple cabbage, jambalaya noodles, red velvet cheesecake, and our own lemonade and tequila LOL. so surprised they let us drink our own cocktail in the restaurant. but omg the food quality was amazing and totally delicious. since my 2011 vegas trip i've subscribed to the cheesecake factory fanpage on facebook and they don't even have any locations in canada! 

our server, i forget his name, he was like the MOST awesome server. like he's funny, honest, and really helped us out. this is the only time we tipped 30% and were happy about it. 

okay i only have one bone to pick with this store: bring it to canada!"}
{"text":"John was amazing. New menu items were on point. Hands down one of the best guest experiences I've ever had. Give john allison a raise. We felt like family. Thx John, hope to see you soon."}
{"text":"We ordered off the seasonal menu. We got grilled cheese, bacon strips and a really delicious stuffed cheeseburger. The food (minus the fries) was good, but it could have been served a little bit warmer. I also consider myself a french fry connoisseur and their french fries were marginal. We ordered the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake and it was very good. They give a very generous serving of whipped cream on top and it is a good slice. Our server was great."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and excellent service. The atmosphere is sophisticated and casual enough to allow the restaurant goer to decide how dressed up he or she would like to get. Wonderful desert!"}
{"text":"Bit pricey- but always delicious. My family and I always enjoy! Be sure to try the herb crusted salmon and fried crab wontons...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always great food, and friendly service. The chicken Marsala is the best, have yet to find any place that could beat it. The cheesecake  is always great as is their tiramisu. The sister property The Grand Lux Cafe is just as good."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.   Wait staff was very friendly BUT they seem to be spread very thin.   It took 25 minutes to get our second glass of wine.. we gave the order to three different servers.   Our plates sat on the table for a good 15 minutes after we were done before they were removed.  Finally a guy named Collin came over and took care of us.   Brought me a glass of wine, my wife decided to pass ( lost sale).   Waiting right now to see a cheesecake menu... waiting ..... waiting....  now two different servers brought us each a menu... strange...As I said the food was pretty good for a chain.   They need to get their service act together. We probably will not be back.  Too many good choices in the area."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, our server was beyond hospitable. It was the wait time that wasn't so great."}
{"text":"Place was loud and chaotic.  Oh and not to mention absolutely disgusting.

We waited 40 minutes after being told 20.   Table was filthy.  Silverware covered in old, crusted food.  When the server finally greeted us 10 minutes after being seated, we asked  her (I thought very politely) to have all the oatmeal and sauce on the table wiped off.  She told the busser \"these people think the table is dirty\" (it was very obviously dirty).  The table was then wiped off, per our request.  But with an off-color rag that left the table wet and smelling like a septic tank.  More dirty silverware speckled with old food and fingerprints were neatly placed atop the dishwater-covered tabletop.  My date and I blinked at each other, then got up and left."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Cheesecake Factory, I actually went to the Apple Store at Ross Park and we decided to stop here for lunch.  When we walked in there was no line and we were seated right away I really liked the Egyptian themed decor it was very calming and ambient.  I ordered the gumbo which was good it had chicken, shrimp, andouille sausage, tomatoes, green peppers, onions, and other spices topped with rice.  Before I left I ordered my desert to go I got the red velvet cheesecake and my daughter got the Oreo chocolate cheesecake.  It was a little pricey for a bowl of gumbo $17.95, $3.00 for a coke, and $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake, but it was good and our waitress was great."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat in Arizona. Service is terrible. Salads look like they came from the back of my refrigerator.  This was once a great place but it's gone downhill so far we will never go back.   We ate outside on our last visit. 30 minutes to get water. 45 to order. We're still here 1 hour and 25 minutes and still waiting for cheese cake. The waiters keep turning the heat off and we are FREEZING.  Don't go here.  McDonald's will be much better and far cheaper.  What a DUMP."}
{"text":"Was here today and I gotta say, was super impressed by our server. Having previously thought the service was dipping a bit, I've totally changed my mind. Tried the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad today, it was great. Always get the lunch size if you have the chance, save a few dollars and it's a good portion size. Our waiter (wish I had his name to give him a shout out) was probably the best I've had there, super on top of things and very friendly. Little things like asking if we had a preference for the type of bread that was brought to the table and also bringing me a to go cup of my drink without me even asking (the person I was with got a to go coffee, he didn't want me to feel left out!) were great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this specific location, and I love that is down the street from my house. We went to celebrate my mothers birthday, tried to call ahead to make reservations but they do not take any. Thankfully it was not busy and our party of 9 got seated right away. Our server was great, but I honestly cannot remember his name :( He was asian, wore glasses and I think his name could have been Han or something like that. 

Food was good, everyone order something different. 
I had their combination plate with my favorite thing ever, herb crusted salmon. Came with a creamy lemon sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes. For the second thing I got their steak diane. I forgot how it tasted and I was craving mushrooms so decided to get it. Let's just say that I did not enjoy it, as I thought I would. 
We had some buffalo chicken strips that were really good. 
And my boyfriend had their jambalaya with shrimp, sausage and not sure what else but it was tasty. Packed with a lot of flavor. Only downfall was that they had ran out of white rice, so they gave him brown rice. 
For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake....eh I do not like red velvet so I am not even going to review this dessert. All I can say is, it was a huge slice. 

As we were finishing dinner, they brought out a little ice cream sundae for my mom, as they sang Happy Birthday. Over all everyone had a great experience."}

Dana is a great server but if she's not there, we can get some great conversations from the bartenders eating at the bar   (shes boisterous, he's quiet but a nice dry wit).  The cheesecakes are all delicious, you cant go wrong!!  The Chicken Farfalle pasta is my favorite!!  These bartenders make the best mai tais!!"}

The Cheesecake Factory
15230 N Scottsdale Rd
Scottsdale, AZ 85254

I've never been to The Cheesecake Factory so me and my friend went on a Friday night and it was very busy. We didn't make a reservation and the hostess immediately walked us to our table without much waiting. If it was for any other restaurant they would have made us wait for at least a half hour but this place was nice. I thought it would take time because it was very busy. The place was really nice, it was very clean and spacious and the lighting was perfect. The ambience was really good and it has outside seating too but we sat inside. There was also a to-go dessert counter. Everything was arranged perfectly and the place was pretty big. 
The waiter was really friendly and he gave us enough time to select our dishes and he even suggested a few for us. Pastas are my favorite so I ordered Fettuccini Alfredo. The quantity was huge and it smelled delicious. The pasta was made of rich Parmesan cream sauce with chicken. The chicken was tender and the flavor was really good but I had leftovers. The waiter was really attentive and responsive to us. Though the restaurant was very busy he was always responsive and attentive to small things like refilling our drinks and asking us if we were good. Out of all the restaurants I've been to I think this restaurant has the best service. They waitresses are really friendly and they are always very attentive.  
After the main dish we ordered Lindas Fudge Cake and Carrot Cake. Both looked very delicious they were amazing. It was the best cake I had in years.The cake had good flavor, was moist enough and there were noticeable pieces of Carrots within the cake. The frosting is also pretty good although for me it's a little too sweet and could use a little more cream cheese flavor. All in all, very good though. It also had a very nice texture to it. I shudder to think of the amount of cardio I'll have to do to burn the amount of calories I just ate. 
My total for the food including Fettuccini Pasta and the Carrot Cheesecake was below $25. Although few items were a little pricy, but it was totally worth it. Everything was top notch whether it was the service, food, ambience or anything. 
Once again, I got a Red Velvet Cake for my sister's birthday and she absolutely loved it. Everyone who came to the party loved the cake and towards the end it was all over. Usually my sister is really picky about food and I was kind of afraid if she would like it or not but when I saw her face when she ate it, I knew she loved it. She said that was the best cake she ever had and I was really happy that she liked it. 
Overall I would give a 5 rating because I think they do a really good job. Since then this has become one of my favorite restaurants and my friends love it too. This has also become like a go-to place for pasta and desserts."}
{"text":"It is located in a very fancy mall which is quite nice to visit.
You have valley parking which impressed me, as the restaurant by itself isn't expensive.
The food was good, I got a burger wrapped in lettuce leaves, it was tasty and the pattie was cooked as I asked.
My BF got a beautiful and tasty dish of salmon and prawns with a tasty mashed potato. Simple dish but was executed nicely.

The price was good and as I am gluten intolerant I couldn't taste their cheesecake (I was sad, cos they look amazing).

Je veux manger mon cheesecake !!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at The Cheesecake Factory with our friends tonight!!  I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and it was delicious!!  The Wild Blueberry Cheesecake was awesome!!!  Highly recommend!!  One pointer, go during the week and do the call ahead seating."}
{"text":"Carissa was our cashier & guide to the wonderful world of cheesecake. We told her we all had different food allergies,  mine being wheat.  Mom is lactose intolerant & bf can't have certain fruits like strawberries. 

She informed us it's cheaper to buy a cake by the half sizes but we couldn't do it.  She was understanding.  We left happy & boy that chocolate mousse cheesecake was mMm! Thanks Carissa D! :D"}
{"text":"Their Godiva Chocolate cheesecake is to die for. Get it. You won't regret it if you're a dark chocolate fan. $8 a slice. Cheaper to buy the whole cake but I wasn't about to eat an entire cake."}
{"text":"I was taken out to the Cheesecake Factory tonight, & hadn't been in quite some time. The last time was at a different location...Biltmore. That was an awful trip & between that and a sexual harassment lawsuit at the chain around that same time, I honestly wasn't sure I'd ever go back. Well, tonight I did and I'm glad I gave it another shot.

Lets get the negative things out of the way first: 
The hostess was not very friendly & made me worry that it had been a mistake to go back. The bartender seemed like he was not happy to be there or to talk to us about drinks. It was a little cold in the dining area, but seemed to warm up as the evening progressed.

Now for good things:
Of course, I got the chicken madeira because I ALWAYS get it and it's ALWAYS delicious. I think the portions are getting a bit smaller these days, but I still had leftovers. Drinks were...meh. I would love if they had a better draught beer selection myself. None of the beers were too exciting so I got a martini and it was...drinkable...maybe. For those prices I'd expect better. Calamari was decent. Cheesecake is always great. 

Food was good, but what made tonight's trip overcome the few negatives and past experiences and warrant a 4 star rating was the service. Mandy was great...very friendly and not snooty like some servers in the Scottsdale area can be. She also did not flirt with the guy I was with hoping to get more tips. I hate when servers do that. 

There was one mistake by the kitchen where peas were added to a dish that was requested without them, but they realized before it even came out and Greg (who I can assume was the manager on duty) came over to apologize personally and offer a soup or salad while we waited. We appreciated it but declined the offer. Mandy was attentive and was taking good care of us so we really didn't feel like anything was much of a wait. She mentioned that she is fairly new, but had she not told us, we wouldn't have guessed. 

Overall a great trip. I will likely put the Cheesecake Factory back on my list of restaurants to choose from on a regular basis. I recommend it. Ask for Mandy...she's good. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a drink before a movie. Sat at the bar  while the bartender chatted with what i assumed was her manager. Both made eye contact multiple times but i was never greeted or offered a drink. Moved outside to the patio in hopes of recieving some kind of service. Ordered bookers neat. Waitress brought me bookers on the rocks. When asked her to make my drink neat. They had strained the ice cold bourbon into a sniffer glass. REALLY??? The server was polite and professional. will not be returning"}
{"text":"Always have great food at cheesecake! Came here for a late lunch after not being here in a while and had an amazing server, Kyle! He was so friendly and helped us with our dietary needs. Definitely recommend him!"}
{"text":"Has a little bit of everything. Pasta, steak, burgers, special entrees. They even have a healthier menu which unlike a lot of restaurants has quite a bit to chose from. 
Most entrees are around $12-15. I think burgers are under $10. Adult beverages are in the neighborhood of $10, aside from beer.

I had the Chicken Madeira which equaled fantastic!! Chicken breast covered in melted cheese with fresh asparagus on top in a mushroom sauce served with mashed potatoes. Plenty to fill even the hungriest of bellies! 

Other guests in the party had steak, fettucini Alfredo, chicken piccata and farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic .. All thumbs up! There was not sit of talking going on once the food was on the table ;)

For apps we had the nachos and the cheesy garlic bread and they were delicious!!!! Honestly would go back for just that and drinks alone!! 

Oh! Can't forget the Cheesecake! I'll sum it up in three words: Don't. Skip. It. 

Service was slightly above par I would say.   Will definitely return! But go when the wallet is full, dinner for 5 with 2 adult drinks, apps and dinner was over $200 including tip!"}
{"text":"My best restaurant ever. Love their blackened Salmon, steak Diane, lemon ricotta pancakes, and the mushroom soup (Wednesdays)."}
{"text":"The Korean Fried Cauliflower was AMAZING, the sauce really made the dish, the wedge of lime offered a fresh zest. The mac and cheese balls came in at a close second. Everything was great but we all got dessert to go and when home realized one was missing, after calling the store were informed we were never charged for it. Had to go back and repurchase or disappoint the person who we were celebrating."}
{"text":"Very good rib eye good service and valet parking. 
What more can you ask for: )
Now would I go here on a regular basis probably not but it's nice once in awhile to enjoy."}
{"text":"When things go wrong here, they more than likely can go VERY wrong. We order this same meal a lot, and it usually takes anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes at most to be brought to the table. Last night after waiting just about twice that amount of time, we still had not been served. And during that entire time not once did we see our server to ask her what- the-f  was going on. After watching the next table get their food delivered.. (they had ordered AFTER us).. it was just TOO much. We asked to speak with the manager, told her our gripe.. and got up and walked out (went across the street and got a pizza in 10 minutes). 
Our mistake was not sitting at the bar in the first place as we usually do.. servers there are captive in a smaller space, and glaring glances are not easily evaded."}
{"text":"This is our first time coming to this location..had the worse experience ever.  To start with they ran out of avocado roll..then they came back and told us they ran out of wings...really being a huge franchise you run out of the main appetizer...will not be coming back to this location"}
{"text":"Cheesecake. Yes, that's what they're famous for.. And probably the only thing that I will eat here as everything is overpriced and the food is just okay. I came here with a group of friends weeks ago for a get together. I just ordered a drink and my brother ordered a cheesecake and calamari which I shared with. The calamari wasn't bad as it was deep fried like any other restaurant that serves calamari.

Cheesecake was wonderful, apple caramel streusel. It was sweet but it wasn't to the point where my mouth was dry (then again I had Long Islands that helped me wash it down.) One of my other friends ordered a burger, and honestly to come here to order a burger isn't really a bright idea. The portions are definitely not worth the amount that you're paying, however this is a \"high class\" restaurant.

And be sure to watch out on the floors. They're super greasy/slippery, as soon as you walk out of the main area and to your chairs. It seems as if you're walking on some dried oil or grease, it's kind of nasty to not think that they would not mop the floors every night.

Overall, I would give it a 2.5/5 but since Yelp has stars I'll round it and give it a 3, just because that cheesecake was pretty good. But, you won't find me a regular here."}
{"text":"CF is one of these places that I have to make a pilgrimage to at least once a year.  I love my Boston CF better for some reason, maybe cause it's home.  Anyway, this past weekend, I took my hubby there to celebrate his bday and come to find out he has NEVER eaten at a CF anywhere.  I almost fell when he spat out those words.  \"It's a rite of passage,\" I find myself squealing out.  Well, he loved it even though he couldn't get over at how small the filet mignon looked on the plate.  However, it was my friend who ordered the Jamaican dish with shrimp that had the best meal at the table.  I had a bite from her plate and my taste buds went into a convulsion, it was stupendous.  I had the salmon special.  It was good but nondescript.  The Kentucky tea and the cherry cheesecake were real smooth and good for my taste palette.  You can't go wrong when you choose CF.  I'm so glad that hubby's eyes and taste buds have opened up to the CF way of eating."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite happy hour spot! Wow! So let me start by saying that I honestly wasn't a huge Cheesecake Factory \"goer\" if you will but after today that may change and I wll tell you why! I was invited by an old co-worker to come out for some drinks and some snacks! My first thought was Cheesecake Factory? For Happy Hour? Huh!? Yes! No doubt I pulled up the menu online and say a few things that I'd be interested in. Now like any other happy hour menu the options to choose from are minimal however they do offer some great ones! I have to highlight that not only do they offer Long Island Ice Tea's but in TALL glasses! For only $5 I believe! What a steal! I was determined to try every drink but they would've had to wheel my out of there! I was able to also try the margarita and although it wasn't as strong as the Long Island it was still acceptable! Crab Spinach dip is a MUST! Even though the happy hour is only from 4-6PM I would still encourage everybody to check it out! This was my first time to this location and I was impressed! Not just by the food, but the customer service was excellent as well! I wish I could remember the waitress's name, she was a doll! I'll be back for SURE!"}
{"text":"Thinking about coming to Cheesecake Factory? Well it better be your cheat day because when I tell you that the level of calories in almost everything on the menu is threw the roof! I like this place because it reminds me a tad bit of the Grand Lux café. I am a cheesecake lover so the variety of cheesecakes that they have to offer are superb! The customer service here is always great from the many times I have visited. This location being inside of Caesars Palace so of course you know they have to step it up! For the food my friends and I ordered the Hot Spinach and Cheese dip along with the Fried Mac'n cheese bites for the appetizers. If you are into burgers at all look under the \"Glamburgers\" on the menu and try out the Macaroni and Cheese Burger! Sounds weird but trust me it has to be the best burger on the menu! Thai Chicken Pasta followed by the Miso Salmon were the remainder of dishes we ordered! Nobody had any complaints! I guess you can say it was a successful dinner, but wait.. that's not it! You can't come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get some cheesecake for desert! My favorite is the Red Velvet and Tiramisu! As I mentioned earlier there are plenty of options to choose from so do your taste buds a favor and indulge in one of them!"}
{"text":"The food is always sooo good but the service is always bad! I have never had a start to finish good experience at the CF and I'm easy to please."}
{"text":"Ahh Lets See.. The Cheesecake Factory Summerlin which is located in Boca Park was pretty decent! I usually have crazy dining experiences with this place however I started to learn what exactly to come for. If you are a Cheesecake Factory fan you know that the menu is insanely overwhelming so it really takes patience to figure out what you want. I was introduced to there short window happy hour (4pm-6pm) a few months ago and fell in love! The prices are so doable and you really can get a bang for your buck when it comes to both the food and the drinks! I went in to this location hoping it would be just as good as the other one that's in the Premium Outlets! It was! Not only is this one closer to home, but it's more fancy and the service was great! Our server was very friendly and attentive! She was even able to get me to try some new appetizers that I've never tried before which was the nachos! That's always a good way to win me over as a customer when you can have great conversation, make suggestions and extremely attentive! Can you say Great Tip '-) For these nachos to be just an appetizer you can easily share with another person. If you're like me and want to take advantage of the entire happy hour menu grab some friends and order everything on the menu. Ball out! My suggestion would be to go not right at 4PM which is the start of happy hour because finding a table top or even a table in the bar area is competitive. You literally have people preying on these tables waiting for people to get up so they can swoop on in like a hawk haha. I arrived around 5:15 PM which is when the first greedy crowd is about ready to wrap it on up!. After about 3 long island ice tea's in and pigging out on the spinach dip, crab dip, wontons, sliders, and nachos it was my time to GO! Thanks to the Summerlin team I now can add another happy hour spot to my list! Their runner up (Kona Grill) is walking distance and has a fantastic happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Always a winner!  I wish everyone would quit complaining about the large portions. It's their thing!!!!!  OMG take the rest home or share!"}
{"text":"After a nice long day of shopping for things I probably didn't need, this place never seems to fail. This was actually my first time at this location but I kind of knew that the food was going to be great because I used to be a regular in the location in Hawaii. 
What I've never had before was the Korean fried cauliflower.. are you kidding me?! That dish was amazing! The cauliflower itself was not over or under cooked, and the flavor is not over powering like how some places make it.. it was so pleasant to eat.... I ordered another one -_-...dont judge me-
Their veggie burgers have always been pretty good in my opinion for as long as I have been eating them.
The customer service and attention that we have received was perfect.. cheesecake factory is doing something right."}
{"text":"We come here often because they offer a decent gluten free menu for my mother-in-law and when my wife's feeling gluten intolerant she'll order off of the cardboard menu too. We have yet to have a bad experience here. Everytime we have gone here the staff is always friendly and helpful with our baby. Always there when ya need em but not shadowing you. It's a good place to go to have good service, good food, with large portion sizes for us chubbier folk. I tried the Chicken Littles and those were good. I rarely get the same thing but would definitely recommend coming to this location."}
{"text":"For a chain this place is kinda amazing. So many options and even the specials are usually good. If you can't find something here to like them you are probably a terrorist"}
{"text":"I don't even know how many times I've been to the Cheesecake Factory, albeit at different locations; this was my first time at this particular Cheesecake Factory, but because Cheesecake Factory is a chain, I didn't expect anything out of Cheesecake Factory ordinary (except I was surprised at how empty this particular location was). The atmosphere and layout are similar to other Cheesecake Factories, and of course, the menu is the same. Let me pause for a moment and talk about the menu- it's big, with what seems like an endless array of menu items spanning across the globe in terms of cuisines. What's nice about the extensive menu is you can try something new every time you visit (that is, if you don't go everyday), but what's not so nice about the menu is the time it takes to make a decision about what to eat. 

Anyways, after being seated, complimentary bread was brought to our table. We had two choices of bread- a soft brown bread with oats on top (Could it be Pumpernickel or Honey Oat?) and a sourdough baguette.  After perusing the menu, I decided to order the Soup of the Day, which was a Lentil Soup with an infusion of bacon essence. Even though there were hardly any customers, it took a long time before our food came out, leaving me no choice but to eat a lot of the bread. By the time my soup came out, I was already full, but I managed to finish most of the soup. The soup itself was very hearty and chunky with lots of lentils, reminiscent of porridge. The flavors were good, but the bacon flavor that the server emphasized was not vey noticeable. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. Portions are large, prices are reasonable, the cheesecakes are good, and there's something for everybody, which I think are the main reasons for why Cheesecake Factory is so popular."}
{"text":"Our family is here on vacation and we decided to eat at Cheesecake Factory. We just finished eating and our server Kaayoo was one of the worst waiters we have ever had. From the beginning  you can tell he was not so happy to be at work. His manners were not up to par with what we have experienced in the past at other Cheesecake factory restaurants. 

Three different times we had to get up to and find another waiter to help us. He was never around to help us with the simplest thing like a refill in coffee or getting us a new cup of water since it had objects floating inside of it. 

The reason for the one star is for his service and not the food. The food was typical for Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"If it were the Cheapskate Factory then everyone that comes here would be using coupons, groupons, and trying to get stuff for free. Oh wait, that's basically what happens.

I'm no fan of corporate chains, and I don't even think TCF's Cheesecake is very good. Their prices are extraordinarily high, their burgers are average, and their shakes are, well, excellent.

However, this particular location is something special. It's probably my fave in the country. Not just for the shakes, but also, the employees at this place are incredibly helpful and nice. They really know how to treat customers and have exceptional rapport and customer service, and for that, I will award them a healthy 4."}
{"text":"Went to Cheesecake Factory with a friend. The restaurant is extremely busy, we have to wait around 1 hour for a table. They have a huge selection on the menu.. don't know why. Just remember that Gordon Ramsay said that restaurant should have a small menu. I ordered chicken riesling. We waited quite a while for the food to come which I kinda understand cuz the restaurant is really really busy. When the food came, I wasn't so impressed with the look of it. Well i can tell that the pasta is the one we bought from the store, it's a huge portion, but tbh, my first impression is that I can totally make this pasta at home. I tried the chicken, chicken cooked perfectly, tender, juicy very well done. The sauce is supposed to have white wine, onion, mushroom, bacon and a touch of cream. Personally I don't like it that much. It's too heavy, the sauce has very strong bacon taste, and the onion is caramelized so the heavy sauce actually have sweet taste as well. It made me feel like it's greasy and also sweet. I couldn't finish it as it's really heavy. Packed up the left over, then my friend suggested to try their cheese cake as we are at the cheese cake factory. Ordered the cheesecake and waited at least 15-20 mins for the cheesecake. I thought the cheesecake should be faster than the main course as the cheesecake has been cut already. We just need to be served. It's very uncomfortable atmosphere with all the ppl walk around you, and wait for food forever. Can't get servers attention and have to wait a long time for everything. The server asked us is the food worth the wait.. luckily he didn't ask me, I'd totally say no if he asked me, but he asked my friend. Lol In general, I won't go back to that place again. The food is pretty average except has a huge portion. That explained why ppl always have cheese factory take out bag with them cuz nobody can finish the food. Then the service is ok, the server is really friendly but the restaurant itself is too busy, it's really hard to find your server around you as they have to walk around the whole place. The atmosphere is too busy, it's not a place that you can have a nice meal and enjoy. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been to cheesecake numerous times. Mostly out of state. But recently I started to frequent this Scottsdale location. My first time was so so... I believe in second chances do I went ahead and brought my GF and a friend over tonight (7-28-16) at around 10pm. 

We walked in and within a minute the host, she was very friendly. We got sat and waited about 10 minutes to get greeted. There were a tons of servers sitting everywhere chit chatting and walking pass us without acknowledging us. I flagged down a server because I had some questions regarding the menu. She was nice but disappeared really fast. Guessing she wasn't our server!! 

Our server finally came over and said hi... Honestly she had ZERO energy! Wasn't really attentive, friendly nor recommended any drinks, apps or main courses! She was a order taker and not a waitress! 

So we ordered our drinks and then our meals. We ordered the orange chicken, mac n cheese balls and the filet mignon tips which I had maybe 30 times in my lifetime visiting Cheesecake Factory. 

Mac was alright, orange chicken was extremely hard to bite into it (overcooked) . That's was my gf meal and she was embarrassed to complain so instead she paid for it and box it up to later throw it in the garbage.

I ordered the meat medium and it came out completely raw, literally blood everywhere. The wine sauce was off... Tasted bad... Really bad. Server never came and checked if we were enjoying the meals so I had once again to flag her down. I explained my concern and she offered to take my meal and cook it a bit more. I declined her suggestion and honestly I was a bit offended. After telling her that the sauce tasted bad and the meat wasn't cooked properly, I was expecting a sincere apologies, offered a new meal and not the same one, and lastly the MANAGER never came over to check on us!!! I just felt like you guys didn't care.

The server came back after 2 minutes to tell us that indeed the chef wanted to apologize because he forgot one ingredient!?! Really!?! That all I get!? My night is ruined, wasted one hour out of my life and this is the kind of solution you have!? 

I worked 12 hours and I was just leaving work and looking forward to eat at my favorite restaurant. Hmm not sure if it still is but I guess I will come back here and there just to buy cheesecake. And ended not eating anything. 

I'm extremely upset that after spending one hour at the restaurant I had to go to in n out to get a burger. 

But the worst part is that the MANAGER never came over!?! This is unreal and I'm really sad that the Cheesecake Factory is going down on service and quality."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is my absolute fave restaurant but this is the second time I've been at this location and had sub par service. Tonight was the worst! I ordered one plate of food and it took forever to come out.i ordered chicken and biscuits and it was disgusting. My biscuits were so hard and crunchy that I had to send it back. The manager comes out and says \"we still have your food in the window we haven't thrown it away we can make you fresh biscuits and re plate it\" like really :/ I don't want that. I'm just totally upset and as much as I love this restaurant we won't be back at this location."}
{"text":"I was so glad to see this place was in Charlotte when I moved here.
I ate at the locations in Chicago and the burbs of Chicago all the time.
Downtown wait was 2 hours all the time, but so worth it.
I've dined at the Charlotte location now a few times and it has been just like being back home.
The fish tacos, Louisiana chicken and I don't even remember all of my other fav's at this great joint!!!!
Just go if you haven't been b4"}
{"text":"Table wait sign up strange.  Give you a time to come back, for us 10 minutes and then we will seat you.  Came back got past the reception area but then waited another 10 minutes. Why not just have us come back in 20 minutes-oh well I guess it works for them.

We had the small salad-not small at all. Good flavor on the dressing.
White bean hummus.  Very large size for the price.  Served with Pita bread.  Good flavor and texture
Four Seasons Pizza.  Good size for the price.  Served with four different sections-Mushroom, prosciutto, basil and artichoke.  Looked like they used slices of fresh mozzarella cheese too.  
Excellent flavors mingled together.  I liked the thin crust.  Slightly chewy and cooked just right.

Service was attentive."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday lunch, and as I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in for-ever, it was really nice to kick it old school...

*Pros*
-Outdoor seating. Having spent the entire winter, and well into March in a snowy DC mess, it was great to sit on the outdoor patio at 4:00 in the afternoon with a Root Beer and a cool breeze blowing in my face.
-Minimal wait. Maybe no one wanted to sit on said patio, but the waiting area was 50 people deep of couples, families, etc and we only had a 10 minute wait for first available. 
-That wide variety of menu items you know and love from CF, including a nice selection of lunch portions (and lunch prices). 
-Friendly staff. Something I miss once I moved to the DMV.
-Quality ingredients, and tasty food. I ordered the lunch grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes for $13.95. The salmon was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. Other dishes ordered at the table included a cheeseburger, cobb salad, and chicken wings. All were devoured. 
-Food presentation is great. I love the way they serve the dishes to you with thought and care.
-Happy Birthday! My cheesecake plate had Happy Birthday written on it, with a pink candle for me to blow out! They also sang Happy Birthday to me. Ahh never gets old even in my late 20's!

*Cons*
-My broccoli was served cold. I mean ice cold. 
-The fountain drinks all tasted flat no matter what you ordered.
-When my husband ordered after dinner coffee, and she asked if he wanted a refill she did not tell him refills were not free. Normally, they leave the pot, or bring the pot over and fill 'er up. Nope, he was charged another $3 bucks for black coffee. Party foul!

All in all a great birthday lunch with good times and good food."}
{"text":"Just some preface, I gave this location a 5 star mainly based on comparison with it's counterparts in California.

I love Cheesecake factory. I like their appetizers, their pastas, their entre's. In California, I've been to the one in San Jose, Irvine, and San Diego. The food is always about the same (good), the line always long (hour), and the service is always mediocre ( too busy to be attentive, professional enough not to make it an issue).

This location was nothing like this in a good way ( maybe cuz it's not CA?)

1. The food was excellent. My party had:
 - Pasta Da Vinci - Great
 - Wings - Good
 - Tuna Tartar Appetizer small plate - good

2. Service was amazing. My drink never even got halfway down, every few minutes someone checked up on us, wow....

3. No wait. None. Walked right in... I don't think I've ever seen that happen...


Amazing. I know how I say I hate reviewing franchises, but wow, good food, no wait, great service...."}
{"text":"Always the best options!!!!! I get the louisiana chicken pasta every time!!!! I've only tried a couple other plates but this one is always my number one choose! I recommend it to any pasta lover!  Yuummmmmmm!!!!!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend take out service! It's a shame to call back the restaurant on an item that wasn't put  into your order & you paid for it - and be told ,\" well you can come back and get it!!\" Not an apology or anything! It's Christmas time ... I'm a cool person. It's the holidays - I get it -- your busy but for goodness sake a little sincerity would have been nice...  bah- hum-bug to you to Cheesecake Factory!!! I will not be back !!!"}
{"text":"Great food, but this location is always busy so it's not a good place to go if you don't have a couple hours to eat your meal. If they are busy, it could be difficult if you need extra accomodations. Not that they aren't willing to help, just a lack of space."}
{"text":"I love this place! Especially this location! I recently went for happy hour to celebrate a late Valentine's Day, and omg! My mouth is still watering from the delish dishes we had! It was definitely a comfort food evening for us, and we were extremely comfortable. We were seated in a corner booth, for privacy, without even having to request so. I wish I remembered our server's name, but he kept both our iced teas full, and he never kept us waiting or looking for him. The buffalo chicken wrap things are my new favorite guilty pleasure food. I can't wait to go back! And the turtle cheesecake! MMMMM!!"}
{"text":"Again, food is amazing, service is top knotch, drinks are great, something for everyone, great for celebrating occasions or just treating yourself. However, THERE IS NO PARKING. I MEAN NONE!!!! We drove around for 15 minutes, maybe more. If we weren't meeting people, we would have left."}
{"text":"Always a favorite! Come early for happy hour at the bar. Discounted appetizers, small plates, and drinks. We love the buffalo blasts! My favorite cheesecake is Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple. I've tried other flavors but that one stands out. All the main entrees are large portion and can easily take half for leftovers. Staff is always friendly and overaccommodating. Never had a bad experience at any cheesecake factory location."}
{"text":"Its was an OK place for lunch. I went on a Saturday and the Mall parking lot was packed. When I stopped here at around 2pm the wait was about an hour they said so I found an open seat at the bar and ordered there. 

The draft beer was pretty good, the rib eye steak with mashed potatoes was fantastic. I got the strawberry cheesecake for dessert and wasn't impressed. You figure The Cheesecake Factory would have great cheesecake but it tasted like it was made of a thick pudding. Maybe I'm used to New York type cheesecake, pretty firm with some nice taste, this wasn't it. 

The place was packed and noisy, when i left around 4pm they were saying the wait was about 1.5 hours. Maybe if I just got the main course I wouldn't mind waiting but overall it was an average (and expensive) lunch."}
{"text":"Too expensive.  Women love it men survive it.  ;-)   have to give it 4 stars 3 for what it does for my diet  and 5 for the cheese cake which is extremely rich."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the cheese cake factory and I've been to this location a few times. The service is great and the food is tasty. Before my party was seated we were discussing the delicious choices of cheesecake over by the displays and noticed a dead fly on one of the cheesecakes. We informed a staff member. The fly was removed and the cheesecake was placed back on the rack to sell! I'm sure it's inevitable sometimes, but I think we were just in shock that the fly was simply picked out so nonchalantly. Needless to say when asked if we wanted to try one of their cheesecakes after our dinner we kindly declined."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few CF locations including the original one in Marina del Rey, CA which was the first time I tried them.  I'm always impressed but a bit intimidated by the exhaustive small book sized menu they have.  The good news is the broad selection of cuisine they offer from Cajun, Mexican/southwest/Asian and more.  The bad news is it's a lot to absorb and select from.

I've never had a terrible dish at any CF location but some are better than others.  They make a pretty wicked Cajun chicken over pasta which is just the right amount of spicy hot and delicious.  Like most of their entrees, it's large enough to split or share which I recommend you do if you even remotely think you may want to sample one of their famous cheesecakes for dessert.

We went here last Friday so the soup of the day was clam chowder which I usually like.  Theirs was tasty but too watery, not creamy as I like it.  We were a party of 6 and I didn't hear anyone else complain so I presume everything was to their liking.

I took my own advice and saved room to share a slice of fresh blueberry cheesecake which was good but definitely not outstanding.  My wife is a dessert guru and extraordinary cheesecake is in her repertoire so I am not easily impressed even with what is supposed to be among the best.  It was good but not great.

Finally, my biggest complaint about this place is the lighting.  Granted I am approaching 63 and my eyesight is waning but even the (younger) others had trouble reading the micro print on the menu.  I had to use my cell phone to see it which could be somewhat embarrassing for others.  It's just an inconvenience for me.  I've eaten in darker restaurants but they all have strategically placed overhead spotlights to help the vision compromised diner like me.

The CF is pretty dependable and I don't see much difference among their locations.  After all, I suppose that is the whole point of a chain eatery - consistency and predictability regardless of which one you patronize.  Their restaurants are all nicely decorated with friendly servers and like I said, seemingly endless selections of food and drink.  A fun place to go for any event or just for a tasty and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Don't think I can eat here again.  The floor was so coated with grease that it was slippery.  My silverware was dirty, my salad bowl was dirty and the woman next to me had to send her cheesecake back because her plate was dirty.  Food was ok but I was completely grossed out."}
{"text":"Speedy service as usual Priscilla was awesome came in around lunch. Food was nice and hot. And had a great view of the dock. Never dissatisfied. Thanks cheesecake factory!"}
{"text":"While some may balk at the idea of eating at the Cheesecake Factory while in Vegas, I have at least one good reason to do so. NO CALORIE COUNTS ON THE MENU!! That means, Vegas is one place where I can eat at the Cheesecake Factory with a clear conscience. 

Plus they have a pretty decent happy hour that happened to be going on right when I got into town. There are a bunch of appetizers and cocktails for $5 and beers for $4. The fried mac & cheese balls are great and you can never go wrong with calamari. I was also impressed with the made to order guacamole which was a huge portion! We ended up buying more chips at Whole Foods to eat the leftovers back in our hotel room. There are also quite a few options on the small bites menu including some healthier (ahem, not fried) items like kale salad and ahi tuna. 

Yeah it's a chain and you can get Cheesecake Factory just about anywhere, but trust me their food is that much better when you don't know how many calories are in it."}
{"text":"So I'm not usually into Chain Restaurants but I must say, this location always does a great job when I come in. I can't help but love the decor, it reminds me of Vegas.... Don't ask why. I don't know. 

The hostesses were all nice, all three of them. Went on a Saturday afternoon with my BFF. We sat in the patio where they have fans and it's mostly covered. 

Ordered the Skinny Cosmo which was surprisingly tasty! They put just the right amount of juice and liquor in it. Our waitress was very attentive, and super sweet. Our silverware and napkins were pretty stained and she wouldn't stop apologizing. She was cute. They brought bread out pretty quickly. We order and shared three appetizers: Shrimp Spring Rolls, Asian Lettuce Wraps, and their tomato basil flatbread thing. All three were pretty good except for the lettuce wraps... They were extremely salty. The rolls came with a peanut sauce and a soy type orangey sauce. For it not being a Vietnamese place, it was not too shabby! 

I didn't get dessert this time but I usually go for the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Yummmyy. Waitress brought out our check at perfect timing, not too early and not too late. Yay! :)"}
{"text":"So many people give the cheesecake factory such a big hype! I don't get it. Decent service, but mediocre food. I've only been here a couple times, so maybe it's not just for me to have such a strong opinion yet. I recent when for a kid's birthday party there. We arrived at 5 pm ( they don't take reservations), there were only 20 of us to which they said It'd be a half hour wait. An hour and fifteen minutes later we are finally seated. The service was great. Very fast paced, they got us what we needed. The cocktails were nice! The bread was just bread, nothing spectacular. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta for the main course. It was decent, but I had to order a side of Buffalo sauce and chili flakes. Barely any spice to it. I was rather satisfied with the portion though. Dessert was great of course. Who can go wrong with red velvet and lemon raspberry cheesecake. Overall this place wasn't bad, I just don't see myself coming here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service
I ordered 2 cake slices on a Saturday night for take out. The lineup to order was non-existent but I was told it was a 1 hour wait for pick up. The order actually took 1.5 hours. 1.5 hours for a premade cake is unacceptable for a restaurant specializing in cake.
There is only 2 stations to prepare their cakes for both take out and dine in orders (dine in orders i think take priority). Each order of cake gets one dallop of whipped cream and other toppings. The servers dont keep track of orders very well. When the order was ready, a server called out the name of the order.

Linda's fudge cake $9.95+tax
This cake was okay however, the cake itself was pretty dry. There were many chocolate and cake layers and the icing on the surface was really thick. The icing was a little too sweet for me. I think there are better chocolate cake out there than this.

Original cheesecake $8.50+tax
The cheesecake had a thin layer of cookie and sour cream? The texture of the cake was really smooth and light. It had the right amount of sweetness. The side of whipped cream was nice. A good cake."}
{"text":"My husband ordered club sandwich, but they were out of turkey. So he ordered the meatloaf with salad  with thousand island dressing. He told waitress it was not thousand island on the salad. Waitress said yes, their thousand island is not like usual thousand island. She could see my husband only ate a little salad, but did not even offer to do anything. Poor customer service...we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Top to bottom- very, very good!
Food, service and value. Inside the Forum Shops make it doubly as fun!

Don't miss it.

Although the day I was there the womens bathroom was flooded and I got some gross stuff on my feet...yuck!"}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night thinking it would be fairly slow but I was wrong! My guest and I got there and were immediately seated which was great. I ordered a steak, not sure which one but it was delicious. It also comes with your choice of french fries, onion rings, mashed potatoes, or a baked potato. I chose the french fries. The service was awesome. Very friendly staff.

This was about my 4th visit and I will definitely keep coming back and I will also recommend it!"}
{"text":"This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.

TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!

Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.

Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.
Neither was delivered on this visit.

I may or may not go there again"}
{"text":"3 stars because there is no one that can not find something they like on this menu! -2 stars because it makes you remember why yelpers like local business.  This place is overrun by teenage yuppies paying their way through Prada with a part time waiting job.  Other than that, this place is really good; lighting is awesome and actually had a co-worker explain that the lighting 'calmed' him. If lighting in a crowded restaurant can do that, it has succeeded in that way.  Food wasn't overcooked, but portions were way to large-no way even the men in my party could finish theirs.  If we not glutton out on fried macaroni and eat smaller portion sizes, perhaps we can solve this little obesity issue."}
{"text":"Shh, I have a not-so-secret to share...I kind of love The Cheesecake Factory! I try not to go too many times during the year but when I do it is an overindulgent delight! You can tell by the sheer volume of the menu booklet that you have many, many, many options to choose from when you eat here. A few of my top favorites included: Buffalo Blasts, Chicken Balaggio, Crispy Chicken Costoletta, Fried Macaroni and Cheese, Thai Lettuce Wraps (love those sauces!), and of course, the cheesecakes! I prefer the layout of this location to others in the valley and given how many customers they get here the employees seem to have a relatively smooth working pace. Whether you are trying to please a large group of picky eaters or looking for tasty afterwork cocktails with co-workers, The Cheesecake Factory is a win!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, always delivers!! Atmosphere excellent and prices are good, and best of all is  the food food quality!!"}
{"text":"We went there on our last day in Vegas, it is located inside Cesar palace, we sat outside, the atmosphere was loud but it was ok, I ordered the chicken Madeira, it was ok nothing special, my wife ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp, the rice was so sticky, we didn't like it.
Overall, I would go again but I might sit inside this time, it is kind of romantic atmosphere not like outside."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing falafel salad. The vegetables were fresh and the dressing was fantastic. It was my first time trying something like this at Cheesecake Factory, but since I love Mediterranean food I thought I'd give it a shot. The only downer was that I was seated on the other side of the ice machine and I guess there was a leak because the area under my seat became wet with dirty cold water. I let the waitstaff know and they alerted the manager, but that didn't stop the hostess from seating another group in that same puddle. This is an isolated occurrence, however so I only docked them one star. Generally the dining experience there is exceptional."}
{"text":"Love this place Julian F was an amazing server!  Had a hiccup with the food but she busted balls and made it a great experience.  Thanks Jullian F.!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this establishment and was very pleased, the menu has changed since my last visit  (3 Or 4 years) so I thought I would try something different, I wasn't very pleased, I won't mention the item but it could have been much better, not taking anything away from the establishment.  I  am usually a creature of habit because when into unknown territory anything can go wrong.

I will say this no establishment make better Shepard Pie than this place, I mean nowhere. I will stick with what I know next time."}
{"text":"New menu. Been a while since i have been here, most of the time i was here I was getting wasted with some stripper from the Hi-liter down the road. And don't remember much except for kicking them out of my condo the next day...but now that I am old and have settled down with a girl...I decided to kill the old demons of fun at this place and decided to drag the new ball and chain here...because she was craving something sweet and nothing beats a fattening piece of cheesecake...so we went and you should go too. 

The Skinny: 

A couple of things...the menu got skinnier, to say the least there new menu is fantastic and I like the fact that they didn't destroy an entire rainforest to make it...the old ones I think use to have perfume sample cards come out. and magazine subscription cards...sometimes I would fall asleep just reading thru it...

I like the fact that the new menu has the old favorites but also some healthier options. The Skinny shrimp summer rolls...the skinny shrimp taco's and the skinny grilled salmon and at pretty affordable prices!!!

Everything was great and our server Dan was fantastic(rainbow) 

We ended the night with the Adams Peanut Butter Fudge cheesecake and it was to die for as it should be. 

Way to go CCF! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Today is my Birthday and I came with my boyfriend and my son. I just wanted to say how wonderful our waitress Julia was! She went above and beyond to make our experience great! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Oh it felt so good to sit down. My girlfriend and I had marched up and down the strip, through the hotels, casinos, and shops enjoying all the sights that could be had. But then our legs started to push back against us. We were wondering around the Forum when we realized a break was need. So we stopped in Cheesecake and got ourselves some much needed water and nachos (food in general was need so we went with nachos). The plate was huge and delicious but they may have just been because of my state of mind.

Any way this is a pretty normal cheesecake. It looks pretty nice but in reality they are all about the same. I regretted that I was so hungry that I did not try to find a place to eat that does not already exist at home."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. Every time I come I have to wait 10-25 minutes which is understandable because they are so good. The menu offers a variety of food which I always have a hard time deciding what to get. My favorites are the chicken piccata, Mac and cheese bite appetizers, fettuccine Alfredo and the pasta carbonara. The drinks are good too! Highly recommend a Georgia peach. Before you leave, you must get a slice of cheesecake even if you have to take it home. They're very delicious and offer such unique flavors. The only downside to coming here is you have to pay for parking on the side of the streets or behind the restaurant in a parking lot or you have to walk a little bit to a parking garage with free parking. Overall, every experience I have here is a good experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for early dinner on the way back home from a trip.
I had the Jambalaya and hubby had some chicken that comes with a brown sauce, brown rice and black beans. 

Everything was OK, just the brown rice was very plain and my pasta was a little tough... 
I like their flavored iced tea, and the bread (molasses bread?)"}
{"text":"I thought I had already written reviews for both of the Cheesecake Factory locations we frequent the most.
Not very pleased lately, one of our most recent visits to this one I had a steak with a side of broccoli, sans the broccoli. My server never brought my side even after we brought it to her attention. 
And they did not even give us a discount or comp... 
We liked them very much in the past but we have not had the best experiences recently, both at Biltmore and North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Chicken Little is actually a massive plate of chicken.
Service was so-so, but for the second time in just a handful of visits we got the salad after the meal. No apology, no explanation, just very casual they bring the Caesar Salad when you are half done with your food.

Well, at least we got it, on a recent visit to the Biltmore location I never got my side of veggies... no discount, full price, and I did not get my side... We may come back eventually but I think for now our money is better spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well had a craving for cheesecake tonight so the obvious choice other than firing up the oven and waiting a few hours was cheesecake factory. As always the cheesecake was amazing. As for the appetizers and entrees well... it was corporate food to a t.  Not that i didnt know what i was getting into. We started with the spinach artichoke dip which for most places is a safe bet but it was very bland. Next were the entree's. I had the New orleans Shimp over rice. It had a very good flavor and was light which is is what i was looking for. The shrimp however were over cooked, but still tasty. My wife had the largest salad ive ever seen. It could of fed a small army... but it was a salad pretty hard to screw that up. All in all ill be back for my once every 3 month visit"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner Sunday with a party of 3 adults and one child. Appetizer was OK (Southwest rolls), I had the passionfruit iced tea (which I like very much), hubby had regular iced tea, the rest of our party had coke, and milk (one milk, one chocolate milk).
For main course I had jambalaya, the rest of our party ordered chicken chipotle pasta, some BBQ burger and chicken quesadilla from the kids menu.
For dessert we had ultimate velvet cake, apple pie chesecake (or something like that), strawberry cheesecake and chocolate ice cream from the kids menu.
I can only speak about the jambalaya and I was a little disappointed. I had asked our server if the jambalaya came with spinach pasta and she said yes. Well, it comes with a tiny bit of it, and the rest is regular pasta. I would have liked to know that since I specifically asked about it. Then, I have had jambalaya here other times and I thought this time there seemed to be no sauce at all, the noodles were not very tasty, server offered to bring extra sauce and it was very runny. The only awesome thing is that I had asked for extra vegetables, specifically artichoke, and the artichoke hearts were really good. 

Portions are very generous (they better be at those prices, hehe) and I had leftovers for an additional meal the next day.
The place was a little too dark and we thought it seemed small compared to other locations we have been to."}
{"text":"The chocolate mouse cheesecake is wonderful.  The red Sangria is amazing.  The food in general is good.  The inside atmosphere is kind of loud.  The patio seating is very nice.  Great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Had dinner here again tonight. We had Shannon as our server and everything was so spot on I couldn't give anything but 5 stars. We had the egg roll sampler appetizer and it was hot and fresh and amazing, a pasta neopolitana and it was one of the best pastas I have had and finished with a slice of adams cheesecake. Normally my experiences here are good but nothing to write home about. Shannon totally made our night. Attentive but not overbearing, and suggested the perfect dishes. Thank you Shannon, you rock and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We don't have these in NY, so I go when I travel.  I love their passion fruit iced tea.  I love their brown bread with butter.  I love the cajun chicken jambalaya.  yes, the portions are ridiculous.  I try to never ever finish my entree if I can help it.  The food is not haute cuisine, but it is really good."}
{"text":"Always good service and a good meal. Packed with calories but you know that going in right? This time I had the Macaroni and Cheesburger..It was fab! I had my usual Arnold Palmer and an early Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer...I took a togo bag with a slice of White Chocolate Cheesecake. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Poor experience on a Saturday night.  Knew we would wait, which wasn't an issue, 45min on a Saturday night is not too bad.

The good:
Food obviously is good, and cheescake.  Atmosphere has a Caesars palace style feel.

The bad:
Beer prices, unbelievable.  $6 for a SHORT dortmunder.  How the F are you going to charge that for a LOCAL brewery.  Yeah sure, if it was a non Cleveland brew go ahead.  Beerhead in the EASTBANK of the flats charge $4-6 a beer for 100 different beers

Service, 
Our waitress was not great.  Waited too long for a beer, then she comes back and straight up lies to me, saying 'oh the bar was really busy'  Listen, I order a beer, not a cocktail, you dont exactly have to 'make a beer', and 10mins ago I was at the bar and it took no time to get a BOTTLED BEER.  Dont lie to my face.

$11.50 for (4) mac n cheese friend balls, Psh, what a joke

Overall disappointed, food portions down, way too high priced apps, and beer is way too much.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory, shame on you."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! Great Food wonderful service!!!!!!! Perfect Birthday at Cheesecake Factory, appetizers were perfect, dinner and drinks were prefect! Thank you Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"We got lucky and got seated right away when we went to visit for the first time. Would recommend trying to get there right when they first open (we were there at 11am on a Sunday morning) to get a seat. I have heard/read that wait times can be up to a few hours during peak times.

Overall, our experience was very good. We were seated in a cozy booth for two by the window which was nice (always love good lighting for food pics!) and our server was so sweet. If you have been to an outpost of The Cheesecake Factory in the States, you will notice the interior is almost exactly the same.

We ended up ordering off of their weekend brunch menu. Food did take a long time (longer than it probably should have) but we were enjoying our coffees and not in a rush, so wasn't a huge deal for us. Our server did come over and check in with us to apologize for the wait.

For my main, I opted for the huevos rancheros and bae got the breakfast burrito (not sure if that is the exact name for it lol). Both brunch meals were tasty and put together nicely. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the pico de gallo salsa was really delicious. I also enjoyed the slight kick from the ranchero sauce on top of the dish. Bae said he liked his main and couldn't finish the last couple of bites - it was huge!!

We obviously HAD to try a slice of cheesecake on our first visit but had a really hard time deciding on which piece - many of them sounded so tasty. Our server recommended the hazelnut crunch to us and we were very happy with our selection. If you are a fan of Ferrero Rocher candies, this would be the cheesecake for you.

As others have pointed out, unless you want to stuff yourself, consider sharing a piece of the cheesecake. Our slice was huge plus super decadent but really really tasty. The top layer of the cake was nutella, with hazelnut cheesecake batter underneath which was laced with crispy crunchy chunks of hazelnut cookie (?). Oh so good!! Even with the two of us sharing, we couldn't finish the whole thing so took the rest to go.

Sadly, about 15 minutes after we left we realized in a panic that we left our leftover cheesecake behind. OH NOOOOO!!! We ran back to see if it was still there on our table by some miracle but of course it was gone. We found our server and she surprised us by coming back with a brand new slice for us to take home. Such a lovely gesture, it was so appreciated!

Looking forward to coming back someday soon, hopefully the lines will have died down a bit by then ;)"}
{"text":"This review could be elevated but not now.  The place is showing age badly. Tables are peeling.  The floors are so slippery with grease.  It's dangerous. 

The food has gone downhill since their splendid opening years ago. 

The staff doesn't care at all about customer service 

I was given filthy silverware and it was replaced with more filthy silverware. Management said they had a hard time hiring good staff 

It's a shame yinzers spoil the environment and aren't up to speed to serve customers here

The food is good and large portions too

Skip the watery , sugary, artificial flavored cocktails they serve"}
{"text":"I usually love coming here but more than likely will never come to this location again. I have been waiting for a single piece of cheesecake for over 40 minutes. All they keep saying when I ask how much longer is soon. Horrible, horrible customer service. They should be ashamed of themselves!"}
{"text":"These people just do good things with food. The only downside to our trip was the ~45 minute wait, which was to be expected at dinner time on New Year's Eve, I suppose. The Factory doesn't take reservations, so that's how it goes. Our server, Kenneth, was extremely enthusiastic, although he kept referring to my counterpart as \"m'lady,\" which was pretty great and also slightly emasculating. I ordered salad with my burger but got fries; whatever, the fries were great, and there was enough ketchup for both the burger and the fries, which is SUCH a rarity at places without self-serve ketchup. She got pasta, which was also really good, and we shared a Turtle cheesecake. \"I mean, the place is called the Cheesecake Factory. We ought to get some cheesecake.\" Everything was marvelous, as expected. Side note, the floor beside our table was really slippery, and we almost fell a few times. Other than that, it was a great way to close out 2013."}
{"text":"I don't understand this place.  The wait was long (40 minutes); lucky of us, the shopping mall distracted us.  I had the spicy cashew chicken over rice.  It was NOT spicy; the chicken was bland (because it was pre-boiled?); the sauce was pure hoisin from a jar. Did the cook put the entire jar of hoisin sauce in this dish, and not other spice? The sauce and the chicken did not go together at all.  My wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap.  It was OK at best. We ended the meal with the warm apple crisp with ice cream. It was way too sweet; spoon for spoon, pure sugar would be less sweet. Only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good. Oh, one more good thing was the complementary bread and butter served ahead of the meal. The service was average.  So, why is this place so crowded that we had to wait 40 minutes for a table?

The chance I returned to this restaurant is very slim. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a chain, but I do quite enjoy the cheesecake factory.  The menu is huge and there's something that can be enjoyed (or at least tolerated) for everyone.  The Miso Salmon is probably my favorite entree on the menu.  The cheesecake is phenomenal (albeit overpriced).  The best thing I like about this particular cheesecake factory is that it isn't overly crowded.  Going in for dinner at 7 does not require a 1+ long wait (like in Maryland, DC, NoVa areas).  The longest wait I've encountered there was 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Visited on a sunny afternoon and seated within 10 mins. The atmosphere was nice and there were no loud or obnoxious tables. The service was a bit on a slow side, but I was appreciative of the attention our server paid to making sure we were being taken care of. I had the cream of chicken soup which was pleasant and tasted like a crust-less chicken pot pie. The bread and other food options served at our table were hot and tasty. No complaint with respect to the food. My only complaint with this establishment was the drink service. The skinny cosmopolitan was a glass of sour toxic waste and for the price (which is not listed in the menu) I'd steer clear of this drink option and just suck down the calories of a true cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"do not sit by the windows, you will be batting away flies the whole time!! We had to ask if we could move because it was so gross and annoying. Had the BBQ burger, it was ok. the sweet potato fries were fresh and crispy. Of course everyone comes for the cheesecake which is always amazing!"}
{"text":"While wandering the Forum Shops my hubby and I worked up an appetite and wanted something easy and quick, but also want to sit down and park ourselves for a bit.  We saw Cheesecake Factory and that seemed to fit the bill!

The Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain and so  you probably either love it or hate it.  In my opinion, the cheesecake is top notch!  Their cheesecakes are rich and served in huge slices that will satisfy any sweet tooth.  However, since I was jonesing for a Fro Ho at Serendipity later, I skipped it this trip.  As for the food, well, it is what it is.  The menu is HUGE (if you haven't been there it is a spiral bound book!).  That is great for variety, but other than the cheesecake they haven't perfected anything.  

This time out I had the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich with Hashbrowns.  It was good, not great.  They put tomatoes on the sandwich before they heat it so they get mushy.  Bleck!  The bread is good and the flavors work.  

We had good service and they sat us on the second floor which was nice since it cut down on the noise.  

Good lunch, nice easy stop in the Forum Shops."}
{"text":"We love this place! We get fried mac and cheese and a pieces of Adam's peanut butter cheesecake almost every time. Great shopping around the area also."}
{"text":"If you like excess, this is your place!   It got three stars because of stellar service; but overall, I just can't get behind this concept.  

Let's start with the menu, which has over 100 options easy.   That's just too many.  Way too many.  It's 20 pages or so plus an insert.  It takes forever to read through, forever to decide, and I'm always wishing I'd ordered something else.   

Then there are the portions.  This place is why Americans are fat.  And not even in a good way.   I ordered a barbecue ranch salad.  $14.95...fine cause it does have chicken and the menu description looked yummy.  But this salad was so ridiculously excessive that our whole table could have shared one for dinner and been full.  I ate a lot and barely made a dent...and let's be honest, dressed salad just isn't good the next day.   There is no reason to serve 8 pounds of salad.  Ever.   Cut it in half (maybe even 3rds) and charge me ten bucks.  And don't get me started on the skinnylicious menu...getting a few items to come it at under 600 calories isn't anything to brag about.   

The cheesecakes are good; but again, sort of excessive.   25 options or so to choose from and no option for a smaller portion.    My fave is the dulce de leche, which is amazing.  I do love it and would go back for it, but I'd probably skip the meal.   

If you decide to go to this location, David was an excellent server.   He took our large party antics in stride and offered up a great time.   He alone (and maybe the dulce cheesecake) could have rated 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory, and was craving for some pasta. So, I ordered their Louisiana Chicken Pasta in hopes that it will satisfy my cravings. I ordered the food to go, and half way through eating it, I found a hair on my food. Mind you, I am a female with long brown hair, and this strand that I found was a short, thick, black hair. Definitely not mine! It made me gag, and I was sooo disappointed. I'm not one to write a bad review on Yelp, but I was just really disappointed this happened."}
{"text":"Went with my wife for the first time. I guess it's ok for a company franchise. The food was great and the service was better."}
{"text":"*3.5/5*

This is located at the end of Caesar's Forum Shops, right next to Nike/behind the fountain with the light show.

I came as part of a group of 5 on a Sunday afternoon, wait time for a table was only about 10 minutes.

They seemed to be understaffed as wait times once seated were long, and a couple errors were made (olives forgotten on pizza, request for no whip cream forgotten, etc). 

I ate the avocado egg rolls app - these are made fresh at the restaurant. The egg rolls were crispy on the outside and the tamarind sauce paired well with it - tasty mix of sweet/tangy. 

For dessert, I had the Cookie Dough cheesecake - super dense and delicious.  

A couple friends shared Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake which was tasty but a bit too much going on for me (brownie, cake, coconut, chocolate chips, cheesecake)."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory. For a chain, I find the food to be really good and there is a great variety. We decided to check out this notoriously busy restaurant expecting to wait. 

Well, wait we did. First, when we next in the queue for a table (after an hour long wait) the hostess ended up giving it to a larger party. We complained and management fixed it and had us seated right away. But I was already annoyed. How does that even happen? 

Then we waited FOREVER for drinks, which were forgotten. Then another lifetime for food. At one point, a manager came over and said the chef fucked up the poached eggs and it would be a while.  So we waited. 

Then they screwed up our dessert order. And the bill wasn't right. I was a bit surprised that we didn't get comped for a portion of our meal, but oh well. 

So, I think the reason the line ups are insane is bc this place just cannot turn tables. 3 hours for food and insanely terrible service. While the the staff is all friendly, there are clearly not enough of them and the processes need streamlining."}
{"text":"Could not believe how far downhill The Cheesecake Factory has gone downhill!  Four of us went and our meals were terrible!  Clearly not as I remembered from other The Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Would I go back? NOT!"}
{"text":"Had a great evening while shopping in the forum shops. Great service and like always great food."}
{"text":"Superb food 
Their cheese always taste amazing 
And cheesecake never let me down
One less star for the service is soooo slow!!"}
{"text":"I don't want to give a long term bad review if I have not had long term bad experience, so I suspect I will update this later after my next dining experience there.  Typically we love cheesecake factor however, this trip we had an issue and I was taken back as to how it was handled.   I ordered spaghetti and meatballs for my kids to all share, the first few meatballs were perfect, but the last one I cut into was significantly harder than the others when I did finally break thru, it was a dark brown inside, almost black in some areas.  As someone who cooks, I can not fathom how this kind of a thing happens other than it being an OLD meatball that somehow stayed in the pot well after its expiration date.  I could be wrong on this, but it was not explained to us and I cannot fathom how this could have gotten this way from being overcooked because the outside was not overcooked in any way.  -So, this makes me really disgusted on how this could happen.  The kicker for me is...there was not explaination, no visit from the manager, and no reduction of the bill either.  I was really taken back by it all.  So, I am not sure what happened but it scared me about eating at this location, wondering what their health standards are."}
{"text":"FAVORITE restaurant EVER! Lovve the cheesecake flavors and everything I've ever had. I don't feel like this place needs to be reviewed but I had the most amazing meal this weekend and had to rave about it! Delish! Enough said."}
{"text":"I try to steer clear of chain restaurants, but my sister and I couldn't get in anywhere else so we stopped in at the Cheesecake Factory. We sat at the bar where we had a fantastic Mai Tai. I'm not usually one for fruity drinks like this, but it was perfectly made. To eat, we split two appetizers. One was the crab cakes off the \"lighter\" menu. They were very small, yet very good! I have to imagine they were on the lighter menu simply for their size. We also had the spinach dip, which we believe came off the lighter menu as well because it was extremely spinach-y. We had wanted to get the warm cheese and spinach dip, but I believe we got something different. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't what we were hoping for in a dip. I find that the menu is a bit overwhelming for all of the choices that they offer, but whatever they make, they deliver well, so they're obviously doing something right."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here for dinner in years!! I love their happy hour the most! The food was ok but not as good as it normally is for some reason! Perhaps a new chef 

Overall, I had a nice time catching up with a friend here! The staff were super nice and the waitress was AWESOME !"}
{"text":"One our favorite go to place with variety of wonderful delights! Enough said about what the food would have tasted like. The last two trips here have always been a nightmare NOT with the wait staff but the host and or hostesses   They stuck us back in the east side if the seating are with all sorts if open tables. Ince back there there was twi very large parties that were so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. We excused ourselves from the wait staff to be seated in another area. She said it would be 5 minutes. After watching several couples and groups get seated right away  and 27 minutes later without a word from the hostess we left
Wont be back to this location   Better to read the reviews and believe them!! !"}
{"text":"The lines... guess there's not much they can do. 
Great pastas and cheesecakes. Other dishes are mediocre. Wait staff paid attention."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused why the reviews aren't higher. In my humble opinion, you can't really order anything wrong from this menu. My food is always fresh and hot and the service is great. I had one issue with the curbside service but it was handled promptly. This my sound pretty basic, but the Cheesecake Factory is one of my favs!"}
{"text":"I had the Louisiana pasta. Not a bad pasta dish but not great either. Chicken was crispy but the sauce on top was a little mediocre. The massive menu here makes it a challenge to find the dishes that they do well here. The wife had the chicken maderia, which she enjoyed the balsamic tasting sauce on top of the potatoes and chicken. The spicy spinach dip was tasty with nice crisp chips on the side was definitely a highlight. And of course washed it all down with a nice hunk of peanut butter cup cheese cake at the end, which was excellent. Service and ambience was great! I just gotta find a more suitable entree there for my palette."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed with this place more often than not.
Our food is consistently cold.  It doesn't have much taste.  And every time we get their Tiramisu cake, it continues to get smaller but the price keeps going higher.  I will say I am absolutely done with this place and will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"They sent a $10 gift card... went back and tried the Oreo and Macadamia Nut... they redeemed themselves... guess it was an off night last visit."}
{"text":"It's been about 4 years Zapponians and myself have come here to team build - and it wasn't a disappointment!

From the time we were brought to our table to the time we left, everything was a great experience!

Tiffany, our waitress deserves a special shout out for being so attentive to our group!

Every time I eat at a Cheesecake Factory, I typically order the same food dishes, starting off with the avocado egg rolls with the sweet cilantro dressing.

If you've never had these, definitely order them as a starter! Ah - Maze - Zing!

I'm also a burger lover and saw the Mac n cheese burger!? What?! My two favorites put into a burger!

Now, I'll be honest, it was delicious to have Lk that extra cheese, I wish the fried Mac n cheese had more of a crunch. I feel the cheese sauce doused that crunch one would want for texture contrast.

Minor detail, it was cheesy, beefy, and the sweet potato fries were delicious!

With the amazing portions that you are served, you have to remember to leave room for dessert!

To top off such an epic meal, a slice of salted caramel cheesecake is always a great closer!

If you're in Henderson and want something to relieve that \"hangry\" pain, come here and spend time with the fam bam or your crew!

They've got something for you!

:)"}
{"text":"The crowd led us to believe the food would be wonderful. We were eventually placed on the patio, where there wasn't enough light to really read the menu. We received bread and water and very little attention otherwise. I wouldn't recommend it, too many food choices nothing special. Then too full for cheesecake by the time service brings mire than bread."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory, the food is delicious and the service is always good.  

From entering in the restaurant and being greeted, you will feel like you're welcomed properly.

The decor is inviting and the staff seems like they're enjoying what they do.

Our party 5 were seated and not too long our drinks were ordered. 

Not much of a wait as we sat, chatted, and perused the menu, did our drinks arrive.

Appetizers were ordered and it was time for a clink of our raised glasses & cheers!

From the delivery of our appetizers and ordering entrees, everything was timely and it was easy for our group to enjoy our time there.

We ate so much that we were sorry we didn't have time for dessert! 

Maybe next time!

Thanks you Cheesecake Cake Factory for an awesome lunch!

{"text":"John is the best bartender!!! Always has a great attitude  and gives great service. He can pretty much make any drink that you want. Best time to visit are his shifts Monday  thru Friday for those people who like to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"We just had the worst service and the food wasn't that great either. The waiter had an attitude towards my mother, he came to the table maybe 3 times, we split a meal and it took 45 minutes to get to the table and when we commented he said that's what you get for ordering medium well. I never knew that 3 medallions could take 45 minutes as I order medium well all the time. The medallions didn't have much flavor at all. Bummed we spent the money on it."}
{"text":"This cheesecake factory is so much better than the one at RossPark Mall. 

The bar service is great, get a Long Island or Asian Pear Martini. My mom had a blackberry (?
) Mojito?? and it was fabulous according to her.
I order off the Skinny Girl menu and my food is filling and well portioned. My favorite is the shrimp and angel hair pasta. Yum!
 I never have room for cheese cake after- so we order some to take home! It is a bit expensive, but worth it. The Godiva chocolate is phenom, so was the cookie dough slice. 

Our servers have always been nice and accomodating, with good recommendations and give you plenty of space to check out the extensive menu. ( for real, the menu is huge). You are also served a bread basket while you wait to munch on appetizers. 

The ONLY thing that stops me from 5 stars, is that I have been there when the wait takes forever for food, or once my party of 5 placed orders at once and one order did not come for minutes after the rest of ours came. 

Overall, a fun place with options for even the most picky of eaters. And the cheesecake? You cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 2 years, as it is the unofficial hangout for afterwork grubbing. I usually sit and eat at the bar, since tables are a long wait. This location has an amazingly friendly team, so I see why it's crowded a lot. My bartenders Jeremy & Chris are THE BEST. Funny and attentive, did I mention funny. These 2 seem to work well together and seem to enjoy their job. My order has NEVER been wrong. Which seems impossible but they are just that good. Also, your greeter (he wears bowties) is a sweetheart, he remembers me every time. Great Job hiring Great People. Thank You, I am a loyal fan!! #CheesecakeFactory"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory Regular, but...

We are regulars at many locations... The grande burrito is my go to usually and is actually quite wonderful with the secret sauce. 

I would give most locations 4-5 stars but for whatever reason both my visits to this location shared the same experience of drier than normal food with almost non of that wonderful secret sauce....

These places are usually packed as this one was and that is fine. For some reason this location seemed so loud though that both times I left with a headache...

I recommend the other locations above this one.... You have read why...."}
{"text":"Don't ever go here. They only allow you two drinks per hour or they claim you are an alcoholic. Very disrespectful and when does a bartender know more than anything. The manager is horrible and very condescending. Don't go!

Ok so just checked no law, but the bartender was uncomfortable; however, she never spoke to me or gave me a sobriety test to see if I was even intoxicated. My husband and I were having a discussion about the NFL draft. How can a bartender ascertain a person's alcohol level without actually talking to the person. Horrible customer service. 

Just because you had a problem in the past with that bartender does that mean everyone needs to be punished. Not a good way to run a business that relies on customer service and repeat business. And also my husband's food was cold so it was obvious that the food had been sitting in the window for awhile.

So basically don't go there if you want to have a good time:)"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake factory has two extensive menu's. The regular and the skinny which has smaller portions and lower calories. We were seated after only a few minute wait which was great for a Friday night without reservations. I suggest a booth over a table which provides a buffer for the surrounding noise. The large room can be conversation challenging when filled with diners. Our server was friendly and attentive. 
The food ordering and preparation were timely.
The Crispy Chicken Costoletta consists of 3 breaded breasts sauteed and served with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. The 3 large breasts were tender and juicy with a crispy panko style breading. This was 1 meal for 2 people or 2 meals.

The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was sauteed with a spicy pepper sauce.  The entree is served with a choice of white or brown rice, along with black beans, plantains, and a cool mango sauce. The plantains were crispy outside and soft on the inside. The generous portion of shrimps were moderately spicy but not overwhelming. The cool mango was a nice contrast to the spicy shrimp.
The restaurant has a Happy Hour but be advised it is only in the bar area which at our arrival was at full capacity. The bar area is wide open and will be on the loud side."}

{"text":"Great food, cheesecake, and great cocktails. A little pricy, but otherwise had a great experience with my fiance. The aquarium right outside the restaurant was fun too!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was great. The food was mostly good, the turkey in my sandwich was extremely dry, but the salad and our avocado rolls were wonderful."}
{"text":"I gave thrm 3 stars because of the horrible service we got.
I rarely give 3 star reviews , none of the food we ordered arrived on-time to our satisfaction.
I had to ask for the bread-and-butter more than 3 times . And I was given the excuse that it's in the oven , which I can understand because it was a busy night.
We ordered some beers that came without the foam on the top , and we got a horrible excuse that beers don't come with forming the on the top.
Like always the food was very good.
I would still recommend this place I just hope you guys will get a good service.

DO NOT ORDER BEER"}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Cheesecake Factory for years and no matter what city or state I'm in I can always count on them for consistently good food! 

I decided to try this location out for my birthday meal since I was craving their chicken chipotle pasta. We started out with the standard bread basket and I had a strawberry lemonade. Our server was crazy busy but he still took care of us for the most part. My chicken chipotle pasta that I also add shrimp too was so delish the sauce is a little creamy but has a kick to it from the chipotle flavoring. The asparagus, tortilla chips, chicken and shrimp  just work perfectly with the sauce and the penne pasta! This is def. my go to entree at the Cheesecake Factory. For dessert since I'm not a fan of cheesecake I went for the carrot cake and it was everything I wanted and more! Moist delicious cake with nuts, raisins and carrots and just enough frosting. 

I have also met my girls at this location several times for happy hour and they have an awesome menu menu with $5 appetizers and drink specials! And the portions are huge 1 appetizer can serve as a meal or can be shared easily. 

Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, I will always be a fan :-)"}
{"text":"I was really happy finding out that they were opening a Cheesecake Factory in Madison. Being from CA, having this built made me feel super nostalgic. I've been to the Milwaukee location but too far for a casual last minute dinner decision. 

Anyway, been at this location a few times, but our most memorable visit was a few nights ago when we celebrated my husband's and father-in-law's birthdays. 

Dana was our server. She started off a little MIA (had to ask other servers for water refills and straws) but as the night went on, she was more attentive. My husband ordered the shepherd's pie and to all our surprise, it looked really greasy. He ordered his usual BBQ smokehouse burger cooked to perfection and was much happier with his choice. 

Out of nowhere, the manager (Quinn) came by to ask us how we were doing and to make sure my husband was satisfied with his meal. His words were: \"I wanted to make sure you leave happy.\" The gesture was much appreciated and very genuine. We definitely appreciated the service and the acknowledgement of our dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"This is a very popular and very busy restaurant. Ordered Chicken Piccata ($12.95 from lunch menu) side salad ($4.95) and slice of chocolate cake ($8.50)for takeout. The Chicken Piccata was a very good portion for lunch. It was okay but not something I would order again for takeout because the sauce lost its consistency and flavor by the time I got it home. Some foods are just not good for takeout and I've had this many times in the restaurant and its delicious. I was not a fan of the side salad. All it was was a bunch of weeds (no lettuce or romaine) 2 small tomato wedges and 2 cucumber slices. Slice of chocolate cake ($8.50!!!!) was just okay. Excellent to go service and excellent to go packaging."}
{"text":"Disappointed that if I order off the \"skinnylicious\" menu, I can't get bread and butter? What? If i ask for it, I know that it's not skinnylicious anymore but that should be my choice..."}
{"text":"Normally the Cheesecake Factory doesn't disappoint, however, this evening the service was abysmal and the food was mediocre at best. 
Firstly my boyfriend and I were clearly ahead of two other groups of two who were seated before us. We had a show to attend after and budgeted two hours for dinner so we asked for first available seating knowing it would be on the patio. The table we were seated at was filthy and there were leaves in my table setting. The server was manic and obviously under trained and over worked. Long story short drinks (not from the bar) took 15 minutes to get to our table, we had to ask for a sugar caddy 4 times, and we didn't see our entrees until 50 minutes later. The manager was condescending when he brought our food because of the obvious disaster. He stated that he thought we had only been waiting 24 minutes! Basically calling my boyfriend a liar. We do know exactly how long it took because we went through two Pokemon Go incense packs and a lure waiting for our meal. The only good part of this dining experience was having the time to sit and talk uninterrupted because our server didn't seem to be bothered to check up on us."}
{"text":"I'm not big on going to chain restaurants when in Vegas when there are so many great restaurants there. However it was getting late and I needed to get dinner at a place where I knew exactly what to what to order. Service was fast, but not too fast. I asked for only the whole wheat bread and they accommodated me.

The only downside to the place was that I got no signal at all on my phone. I wasn't the only one with that problem. That's not The Cheesecake Factory's fault, but it would be nice if they installed WiFi in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory.  The food the atmosphere and the service are top of the line.  I would like to comment on a server.  Her name is Ashley.  I am 64 years old and have traveled the world.  Her whole persona was just amazing.  I have never had a server with such class and immediate attention to service like Ashley.  You needed something she had it there before you even called her.  Just incredible .  Always smiling.  Never pressuring.  She made our eating experience one of a kind.  In a day and age when people don't care to be kind it was so refreshing to have her.  Thanks Ashley.  Hope we see you again."}
{"text":"There is no reason for me not to give this Cheesecake Factory 5 stars. There was nothing wrong with anything you look for in a dinning experience.

- Seated quickly
- Good and attentive service
- Fantastic food for my wife and I
- Reasonably priced
- Great selection of food, dinks, and desserts

I wish I could remember our servers name but he was on point with everything. Gave us extra bread and kept the ice tea coming.

The BBQ Chicken Pizza was very good, and the wife shrimp sandwich was fantastic! Lets never forget the classic strawberry cheesecake to top it off, and I already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"On special occasions, I like to treat my better half to the Cheesecake Factory!

Our absolute favorite dish is the \"bang bang chicken and shrimp.\"

It consists of a mound of rice, surrounded by mild curry with chicken and shrimp sieging  the mound.  You could easily order one serving and share between the two of you, but it is so good that we order one each!  It makes for a good leftover lunch the next day.

The service is absolutely amazing.  The last time we went, had a waiter named Marty and he took care of us and went out of his way to make sure that we were had a great time.

I recommend getting the strawberry lemonade.  A bottomless glass of bursting flavor is what you will get.  Highly addictive and now that I am writing this review, I long for another.

You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without taking advantage of its namesake!  Our choices for desert are:

- The Banana Cream Cheesecake
- White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm giving one star strictly based on service. The food is great. 

I had just moved to Las Vegas from California and have eaten at multiple
Cheesecake Factory locations on many different occasions. 

We decided to eat in the bar area rather than wait for a table. We sat down and our server, Melissa N., came up after a few minutes and took our drink orders but didn't ask us if we wanted to eat (we ordered 3 waters and a lemonade). She brought back our waters and walked away. We tried to flag her down for menus but she never stopped. One of us went to the host stand and got menus, 10 minutes later she came back and we placed our order and asked about the lemonade and she said she'd bring it right back and did. 

While we were waiting for our food she brought us bread however she forgot bread plates and place settings. We waited for a few minutes and didn't see her so we asked another server if we could have silverware and she promptly returned with silverware, napkins, and bread plates. 

Our dinner arrived via food runners and upon inspection 1 of the 3 salads had dressing and one of the sandwiches had mushrooms when we requested there were none. We waited and waited, no Melissa, so we stopped a host who was walking by if she could find her. She finally appeared and delivering another tables food and one of us had to walk after her because she never even checked on us. 

She apologized for the mushrooms and said she'd have another one sent right out and also said she'd bring the dressing right back, \"I'll be right back with your balsamic\" however, I previously had asked for ranch. 

It took another 10-15 minutes for someone to tell us that the sandwich was almost done. It was a manager and I asked for it to be packaged to-go because everyone was already done eating. We told him about the utter lack of service and he apologized and offered to buy us desert, we accepted. Melissa came back with the sandwich packaged to-go and asked what kind of deserts we'd like, we told her and requested no whipped cream be put on the cheesecake. 

She said she'd get them packaged up for us and left the bill. The manager was kind enough to comp the meal but only comped one of the slices of cheesecake after he offered to buy it for us. 

We paid the bill and Melissa returned with our cheesecakes, of course one had whipped cream. I would NEVER recommend this location to anyone strictly based on service, the food quality and portions are great but the service is absolutely dismal. 

Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills, Glendale, Redondo Beach, and Thousand Oaks are a few of the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to and I'd give all of these locations 5 stars all the way around and have no hesitation recommending them to anyone."}
{"text":"Took about 3.5 hrs to get seated for dinner for 5 on a Saturday (got there around 3:50). Once we were seated it took another 30 mins just to get drinks at our table, they also ran out of Stella.. Our server had to keep coming back to tell us that the apps we ordered were sold out / some of our entrees were sold out as well. We ended up having to go for our 3rd / 4th choices for some items which was a huge disappointment... but surprisingly it was pretty good! Food was worth going there for. Service near the end was super slow, we wanted our cheesecakes and the bill, took another 30 mins.."}
{"text":"We had a really nice server. The Cashew Chicken is a HUGE dish- it lasted me for 3 meals.  I shared Adam's Peanut Butter Cheesecake and it was AWESOME. I love Cheesecake Factory. They have a huge menu and their bread is awesome! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The taste is wonderful.  We love the chicken crusted Romano with Caesar salad. And dessert lemon cheesecake.. Good customer's service."}
{"text":"With a huge menu, they still don't have a gluten free desert, and not much else is gluten free. Allergen data is not available. I tried the one cheese cake (Godiva) where only the top layer was supposed to have a tiny bit of gluten, but I got a couple of bites into it before I remembered to take off the top layer.

Now I'm sick.

That a popular restaurant like this has gluten throughout almost everything, and no information about it, is a slap in the face to those of us with serious gluten allergies."}
{"text":"Cheesecake es de mis restaurantes favoritos pero la última vez que fui , la pizza la prepararon diferente y estaba muy mala a comparación de la ultima vez que fui a cenar y ordene exactamente lo mismo , y en el mismo restaurante"}
{"text":"I kept on calling all day and always had a busy signal.

Then I finally got through at around 6:45pm, a girl picked up and put me on hold for 20 mins! Then I hung up.


I understand it's busy but their customer service is crap, they should hire more employees to answer the phone and on the floor as well, this will solve their wait problems and prevent complaints and bad reviews."}
{"text":"Love this place. We usually pick this place for date night. Waiters remember us of all the people that come there. So sweet. delicious food. Especially the cheesecake omg to die for..Fabulous service."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory, one of my favorite spots and very popular among my friends. 

This time around was last thursday 12/12/13 and our server was Shawn M. dinner time

we had a good size group about 12 people total. They sat us with 8 because the rest of our group would take some time.

Starting with the food. I am an impulse kind of guy, i like to try new things but don't like deciding. This time i actually saw a picture of the dish i got on a screen above the bakery counter. I got the steak Diane. med rare super tender and flavorfull. with potatoes. I also tried some of the caesar salad. Both amazing and up to par for cheesecake factory.

We got sat and we were starving. our waiter came over explained the specials as they usually do. We were very thirsty and asked for water. He claimed he was not taking drinks right now he will just explain the specials and come back in a few minutes. Something im not really used to hearing as we all just wanted water. I am myself a server so i tried to be understanding. When he did come back a few minutes later. we gave our drink orders mostly water. My girl said we ready to order too when you are. He explained \"ok well im just gonna take the drinks now until the rest of your group gets here give me a minute\". The tone was very unfriendly to me and my entire group. It was obvious he knew we were a gratuity table and since we were young did not care to go above and beyond to get the little extra that cheesecake servers usually give. At this point i started to pay attention to him. Noticing which tables he was responsible for, how many were seated etc etc. this just justified the fact that yes we were a gratuity table of kids to him and so he did not care as much as he did his other tables. When he came back i decided to speak up as the rest of my group were kinda annoyed. I explained clear we are ready to order when you are, the rest of our group will not be here for awhile. This is after about 15 minutes of us being seated already. an estimate of about 35 minutes until we finally started receiving our food. Not ideal but nothing we could do at this point. My water specifically was refilled only twice, i drink a lot of water, and less than half way through my meal i was done. and didn't get a refill until i was done with my meal. Then once more AFTER i received my split check at which point i no longer needed a refill.

Order taken food arriving and the rest of our group showed up. 

this part annoyed me the most, he explained to our friends that just arrived \"yeah they didn't wait for you guys so let me know when your ready to order\". Little does this server know we explained that to them already and they are the ones who told us to order because they would not be there for awhile.

This is something i am not used to at cheesecake factory. This particular server definitely did not start us off right. i am sure that the rest of my group might not understand why. But as a management myself i know when a server notices a young gratuity table and does not care to meet minimum standards of service. We were his only large table and from what i could see he was not so overwhelmed that he could not care to give us the service he was giving others. Where as his smaller tables got lots of time and attention.

Night ended and he put us all on one check. Someone asked to have it split and he did so. Thing was he knew pretty much exactly what everyone had. The time it took for him to bring us the split checks, and cash us out was definitely inattentive. We were actually trying to meet our next destination at a certain time but ended up not going because we were waiting for him to cash out our checks. We got the first check at 22:13 and my check personally was not checked out till about 22:33 per my receipts. 

with this series of bad events and lack of care for a young gratuity table. that is why 3 stars.

My only advice is if you have a large group try your best not to have this server. 

automatic gratuity is necessary but should never be an excuse for poor service at a restaurant known for service."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory,  the service is always great. I especially like the bread they bring while you wait for your food so fresh and yummy. 

I can't really tell you about any other dish other than the Chicken Madeira and the chicken alfredo, what can I say I love chicken.  The tropical tea is also really good tricks you into thinking its sweet so no sugar is reallw needed."}
{"text":"Wow - i'm stunned by the negative reviews on here. I am a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, i have been to several locations in the US including the Walden Galleria location (check out my review!). One thing remains the same - great quality, great service, amazing variety and huge portions!

We arrived at Yorkdale Mall at 12pm. The idea was lunch and if the line up and wait time was too long, we would leave and eat somewhere else. The first thing i noticed when walking in was there was no direction or signs posted to let people know where to check in to give their names, or to line up if there was one. There was a counter to the left with 3 people behind it and a podium to the right with 1 person behind it, so i walked over to the podium. I asked if there was a wait time and how long it was. The answer was \"75-90 min with no guarantee\". That threw me off because other than people walking in & out of the mall, the entrance was clear. I asked her where we could leave our name etc. and she answered back \"there is a line up in front of Victoria's Secret\". Glad i asked otherwise there are no signs or anyone directing people that are trying to get in to the restaurant other than Security once someone tries to walk in. FYI at that time, she hadn't bothered to tell me that the line up in front of Victoria's Secret was just a line up that we had to wait in, to come back to her and give our names. That was my biggest issue with the process, not the wait time! It's a mall people. If you can't find something to do with a buzzer in your hand that allows you to go as far as Sporting Life, then that's your issue.

We lined up at 12:15pm. It didn't look too bad and moved 3 times in 30 min which got us back to the main podium near the door at 12:45pm. I was given a buzzer and told to come back in 75-90 min. We sat on the benches in front of the Godiva Store with a bunch of other people also waiting for a table. We did some shopping and window shopping to pass the time. Kids had some snacks & their tablets to keep them busy.  Honestly, if it were a stand alone location, there was no chance in he$$ we would've waited even half of that. Thankful for the mall being there and so much to see & do to keep busy.

We were finally seated by 2:45pm. Our server (Brittany) was great! She apologized for the wait time after introducing herself. I mentioned our daughter's peanut/nut allergy right after she greeted us. She listened carefully and said she would talk to the kitchen before any of our orders were put through. She took the kids orders and our appetizer order and went to get our drinks. We never had to flag her down or look for her. She was at our table & others frequently and made sure drinks were topped up, empty plates were cleared and ALWAYS asked if we needed anything else and how we were doing and how our meal was.

Our order:
Hibachi Hanger Steak w/shiitake mushrooms, onions & bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura battered asparagus. My hubby loved this dish! His steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I couldn't try it as i have an allergy to shiitake mushrooms, but he said it was perfectly cooked & seasoned and it was a nice large portion and definitely something he would order again!

I ordered the Grilled Steak Tacos - OMG this was super super delish! Honestly, i was looking at the large salads & burgers that i usually have, but decided to try something new. Hands down one of THE best steak tacos i've ever had at a restaurant - ok, other than in Mexico! 4 small tacos filled with perfectly grilled tender steak seasoned so well that i could eat nothing else and be happy! It was topped with chopped avocado, tomatoes, cilantro, crispy onions & chipotle sauce. On the side: a small bowl of black beans & a side of rice. 

Our 7 yr old with the peanut/nut allergy wanted macaroni & cheese. Her food was brought out right after our appetizer by another server. She explained that it took a little longer because all the bowls & utensils to make her food were cleaned for her order to ensure no cross contamination or contact with any nut products. I was floored by this. Who does this at restaurants?! AMAZING! My daughter LOVED the macaroni & cheese!

Our 4 yr old ordered chicken tenders & fries - 5 lightly battered crispy chicken tender strips. Served with 2 dipping sauces - huge hit!

Red Velvet Cheesecake - OMG YUM - just try it!

FYI - you can order take out at the counter to the left of the mall entrance. There is a counter with cash register & menus. Wait time is 20-30 min. If you want to order dessert to go, there is a line up at the bakery inside, or you can put an order in through your server when you are ordering your food. It saves time! They don't serve any frozen food - everything is made fresh to order.

Would love to see a location at Markville Mall after their current expansion. Or Vaughan Mills. Another location would certainly help the wait times & line ups. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Would it sound strange that I really like The Cheesecake Factory even though I really do not like cheesecake?  Well, the restaurant that I've frequented over the last few months has made that an easy decision for me!  In fact, it's another of my favorite happy hour locations in town.  It is only weekdays from 4-6 PM, but I've never had too long of a wait to get a space in the bar.  In fact, the only time I have waited was last night, when I had a group of six wanting to enjoy happy hour.  We got a pager and sat at the bar until the table was ready ten minutes later.  

Between a visit a few weeks ago and last night, I have enjoyed the fried mac and cheese, the southern chicken sliders, and a salad for under $6 a full-size plate.  There were also many great drinks specials at the time.  

While I've always been fortunate with parking at Kierland, one of the only challenges of The Cheesecake Factory is that they rarely take reservations.  I've lucked out the last two times though in the past, I have had to wait for a while for a table.  As long as you don't show up right between 6-7 PM on weekdays or during meal hours on weekends, you should be fine though.  

I've always had fairly good service and delicious meals though unless it's happy hour, some meals may be a bit more on the pricey side.  But again...those fried mac and cheese balls.  Wow!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory off 24th St & Camelback is definitely the best location. Behind the Bar M-F is the inviting Bartender John. I can tell you that my choice to sit at the bar every time I come in is because of this guy. All you regulars in the Biltmore area know what I am talking about. This guy is great and really makes this location the best. I kept my dining experience simple this time with the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. Let me tell you these things are great! I also ordered the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. This piece of cake is better than any cheesecake on the menu. If you find yourself in the area check it out."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory in Chandler is one of those restaurants you want to take your family members such as your visiting aunt and uncle from Korea. It would also be a nice place to take your international friends from China or Mexico. That's because the atmosphere and interior is well designed. When I took my mom here yesterday, she was in awe. \"Wow, this place looks great!\"

That's all that the Cheesecake Factory offers.

The waiter brought us two empty plates. The dishwasher didn't clean it correctly, so he exchanged it for new ones right away.

The food is not great. That's why you shouldn't bring your spouse here for an anniversary or have a first date here. My mom ordered a pasta and we both agreed that it tasted bland. 

Finally, we shared a slice of cheesecake and my mom ordered a coffee. The slice of cheesecake was good, but it's not worth the money.

The lunch+dessert+coffee+tip was around $34 that day. The place has a great atmosphere, but the food isn't worth anywhere near $34."}
{"text":"Go for dessert; eat your meal somewhere else!

The food is overpriced, and the portions are just crazy large.  I always leave feeling stuffed, but guilty because of the huge bill and the huge amount of food that was either thrown away or in a to-go box (which usually ends up...thrown away).  I can almost never get to dessert.  

One good thing is the appetizer menu - I could make a meal out of most stuff on there and not feel quite as stuffed.  The fried mac and cheese is good, and so are the pot stickers.

Worth going to say that you've been, but save it for when you've been starving yourself."}
{"text":"The service was good as usual. Ordered the steak, it was cooked to perfection. The waitresses also also really nice. I would recommend this place if you come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love the cheesecake factory! I've been to this location several times. The management is very active and concerned with the individual customer and the food is amazing of course. My mom and I were there on wednesday night, it was busy for a weeknight, but the service was good and the waiter took his time with us. We originally were seated at a small table sandwiched between a group of teenagers and a woman that was (literally) screaming in my mothers ear (I believe she had some old-age hearing loss). I went to the hostess booth and requested to be moved outside, and the hostess moved us without problem. 
We ordered the Orange chicken and Bellagio chicken and shared both of them. Both dishes were delicious and distinctive. The portions were big enough to have food left over for the following day. We finished off with Godiva cheesecake and Kaluah cheesecake. Everything was incredible. $72 dollars for two people is not what I would call cheap, but it was an amazing meal and well worth it. :)"}
{"text":"I wanted this to be a higher-star rating, I really did, but I still can't believe I waited 4.5 hours to spend my money. When I read the reviews and saw the 4+ hours wait, I didn't believe them and now the joke's on me. I went two Saturdays ago at 5 PM and only got seated at 9:30 PM, which was actually our quoted time, because my sister spoke with the manager regarding some issues we had. For example, when she went to get the buzzer, they actually gave ours away to someone else and claimed we picked it up when we didn't. Then, other people that were waiting for less time with the same amount of people in their party got seated before us just because they complained about the long wait. Not to mention, the line-ups are super confusing. I actually went to the second line-up where you get the buzzer by accident at first, and should've just stayed there...

Do yourself a favour and drive to Buffalo to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. You'll probably be seated in less time. Or come back to this location months later when they start accepting reservations.

The food and portions, however, are worth it. The pastas are amazing and even after waiting as long as I did, I could only finish half of the pasta and packed the rest home along with my cheesecake. They give quite a lot of protein when you opt to add chicken or if it already comes with it. The white chocolate macadamia cheesecake was sold out though, so that was quite disappointing. I tried a bite of the farfalle pasta my sister got and really recommend it; it was so delicious. I got the four cheese pasta with chicken and everyone around told me how good it looked. It tasted even better but I kinda expected more cheese (I LOVE cheese).

Love the food, great value for quality and portions, but damn the wait... Maybe I'll come for brunch first thing in the morning and pray it will only be a 2 hour wait. I'll update my review when I do brunch."}
{"text":"My family and I go to Cheesecake factory often and we always go to this location. I am very surprised this location only has a 3 and a half stars.

I just finished brunch with my family. We had Matt as our server and he was fantastic! He was prompt with our requests and he had a positive attitude. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent about our dining experience.  Ron, our server, was wonderful. Very attentive and prompt. Our food was served quickly and the steak cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Friday Night, great service, very personable, kept drinks full. Called people by name as he handed credit cards back."}
{"text":"Came back here tonight with some friends and we ended up waiting 2 hrs compared to the 40 min during my first visit but we did expect the wait to be long as it is a Friday night. Our server was super nice and attentive and always came to check up on us despite how busy the restaurant was. Ordered mai tais and fried macaroni and cheese as an appetizer. This item is a must have, they are sooo cheesy and work so well with the  marinara sauce. We were kind of disappointed that they weren't served as hot as we would've liked, it was more room temperature. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my friends ordered the gumbo and chicken riesling. We all really enjoyed our dishes but once again they were served warm almost room temperature. As they were serving our dishes they warned us that the plates were really hot so we thought that the food would match the temperature as the plates, unfortunately not. The cheesecake were obviously delicious so I will definitely return maybe for take out next time"}
{"text":"Good food and a good wait time. Would go again. A little expensive but big portions. We felt rushed as well."}
{"text":"Sit down and bring your reading glasses!  This menu was endless! Lots of global options and various dish sizes. I opted for the Chicken Bellagio which exceeded my expectations.  The chicken was nicely breaded and moist, the pesto noodles were not too oily, and the arugula salad added a nice crunch. I was only able to eat half at the restaurant,  but my left overs held up well. The cheesecake was delicious of course, no surprise there!"}
{"text":"Overpriced crap.  Nothing comes with sides of any kind.  $40 bucks for 4 lousy sliders and some overdone shrimp, oh and 1 piece of cheesecake which was $10.  SMH Never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner July 3 to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The wait was about 3 minutes - all the people we dealt with were very courteous and made recommendations on what to order.  The menu is huge and the servings are large.  We took home enough for dinner the next day.  We were stuffed - the food was very good and we had no room for cheesecake which was disappointing. I think we will go back just for cheesecake and coffee (or tea).  The strawberry daiquiri was very strong and very good.  We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this location of the Cheesecake Factory only has an overall star rating of 3. The food has always been delicious and the customer service wonderful. The greeters and servers are always pleasant and helpful. I've ordered many different dishes here (ranging from French Toast to Biscuits and Gravy) and everything I've had tasted great and was made to order. The layout is a little congested without a whole lot of room to maneuver around between tables, but that's not a big deal. The connected shop is great too with lots of quality items including clothing (for adults and kids), home goods, decorations, toys and vintage candies. I would definitely recommend this Cheesecake Factory location to others."}
{"text":"We got there after 7, they don't take reservations so we were expecting to wait. We waited for about 45 minutes and our buzzer went off to be seated. We walked over to wait to be seated and a group of 5 that got there after us was seated before us.
Then we got drinks. My friends a Moscow Mule, which was I think around $10 and my other friend got a martini that was almost $12. The Moscow Mule did not taste like one, but still was good. The martini was okay. Then they got a Tequila Sunrise and an amaretto sour. Both drinks were way too strong and not made properly. I understand that this is not steakhouse and has cheap food or drinks, but if you're going to charge the corporate price, then the bartenders should know how to make drinks.
We got appetizers: macaroni balls, baked potatoes bites and nachos. All were good. Then when we all received our entrées we were disappointed. Four cheese Penne pasta, fish tacos, and I think some type of shrimp scampi. Once again, the price should match the quality. I know we don't live in New England and have catch of the day, but the fish was too \"fishy\" so I assume it wasn't that fresh. 
The cheesecake was spot on as always. 
They were busy so I understand some things but they could step it up a little. 

I've had much better experiences at other locations."}
{"text":"Love the Cheesecake Factory! ...but the server behaved badly. 

We were sitting at the tall tables by the bar; the server stood to the left of my companion, then reached across her plate to place a cup of hot coffee on the right! When the server did this a second time, I made a comment, but the server got defensive. 

To this Cheesecake Factory manager: consider training your waitstaff with the basics:
- \"serve from the left, clear from the right\"
- \"the customer is always right\"...never defend a behavior that a customer is unhappy about, simply apologize"}
{"text":"I love this Cheesecake Factory however they DO NOT take reservations Friday - Sunday (what other days do you need reservations) unless you want to eat before 4:00PM?  Their website claims to accept reservations. When I called  was told I was incorrect and it didn't matter what it said on the website. Disappointment in the way it was handled is an understatement.   Still love the food just needed to vent about the true lack of customer service"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food and atmosphere at The Cheesecake Factory. We're also happy we now have one in Greenville. The \"Skinnylicious\" menu is just right."}
{"text":"The menu is HUGE! lots of variety. server was fantastic! I left full & OVERLY SATISFIED! Would highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Decent food horrible service. We ate in the bar area. Staff was everywhere but not attentive we had to ask for water, straw, saucer, silverware, salt/pepper..... The table was not set and staff didn't address it at all. Observed several other customers in the same situation. NOT typical style/service that I expect from the Cheesecake Factory especially with a $60 bill."}
{"text":"Tonight We had the pleasure of receiving the most excellent service from Micheal. A most memorable experience I enjoyed with my love. Food was delicious,full of flavor. Those mushrooms though ;).(order the mushrooms).., upon leaving very satisfied we were quite surprised at how many people wished us a good even.Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"It is what it is.  I like the patio at this location.  We go every so often when we don't know what we want because the menu is huge & has something for everyone.  The waitstaff is fine.  Some are stars, some not so much.  I never leave saying wow that was great, but it fills the void in my stomach in a manufactured, corporate kind of way..."}
{"text":"The two stars are for our server only. He was incredible and really went out of his way to help make sure the dining experience was not a total loss.  However, the food was just plain dissapointing.  My mom ordered a pear and walnut salad with bleu cheese.  It came out with some cheese that did not taste like bleu, about 5 walnuts, and no pears.  So when we asked the waiter for some pears, he apologized and went to get a manager.  About 10 minutes later another waiter plopped down a small dish of cut pairs on it and left without another word.  The pears were dry, all 3 of them.  The rest of us all had hamburgers, and while the meat and toppings were good, the buns were soggy.  I know I shouldn't expect much from here for the food, I mean we all come here really for the cheesecake, but if a restaurant is going to have such an extensive menu, the food should at least be palatable and decent."}
{"text":"I like Cheesecake Factory not just for the cheesecakes. Good selection of food for lunch or dinner.  I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo and was able to get brown rice with that which is great. The menu has plenty of burgers, sandwiches, steaks, burritos, etc. good selection of salads as well. 
The downside to Cheesecake Factory is the wait to get a table. They are usually pretty busy during normal meal times. I was with a large group and was told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes but we only waited about 20 minutes."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has been a reliable restaurant to me no matter the location.  The menu is diverse, the food is consistently good, and the service is generally solid.  This all rang true for my experience here as well."}
{"text":"Sure it's a chain, but every individual establishment has its quirks.

However, this Cheesecake Factory delivers with gastronomic fireworks.  The quality of service and food were reflective of a five-star restaurant without mirroring the small portions and high prices.

For instance, the pizza with salad lunch special combo was so big, even a Wooly Mammoth probably couldn't get it all down.  The burgers are also so big, I even had trouble getting my big mouth around it.  The food was exceptionally delicious.  I also highly recommend the Thai Chicken Pasta, which I usually get almost every time.

Of course the ambiance inside is also very nice.  I think about 5 staff members said \"thanks for coming\" on the way out.  Hands down, this is one of my favorite chain-locations to dine at!"}
{"text":"Wait wasn't long at all! Service was amazing and so was the food. Plus, there is a shopping center for you to browse while you wait. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've gone here now for the past two years. I'm guessing 8-10 visits. I go here because my best friend and his wife like to go here. The cheesecake is good. Expensive, but good. 

But the food is not. I've tried a variety of items. The are rarely seasoned. They are dry. They lack taste. I tried the chicken and biscuits tonight. Terrible. Two flattened pieces of chicken with tasteless gravy on the plate. Two small muffin looking \"biscuits\" on the side. After salting this concoction three times I gave up. 

Why is this place always busy? It must be the dessert because it sure isn't the food."}
{"text":"First I hate when people call it \"Cheesecake\" as in, \"I am sacrificing a meal tonight and eating at Cheesecake.\"  Please...

Anyways...
I have pretty good memories of this restaurant from childhood because back then I guess I didn't realize that it was a chain.  When I was a youngster in Michigan, it was always special to go to The Cheesecake Factory in Chicago and wait your 2 hours for a table and la te da.  

Now, I realize that it is just one of the billions of chains on 83rd that is just sub par.   The last time I was there we ate an okay meal but had to wave our waiter down for water refills and earlier in the meal when he was taking our order, he actually sat down next to me while my boyfriend and I were ordering.  BIZARRE!  The guy clearly couldn't read body language.

Huge Menu
Huge place
Loud
Food that is just okay

I know you can do better..."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! Drinks stayed empty, server ignored us and one person in our party got the wrong order."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday and our anniversary. Waiter wasn't friendly or very inviting. It felt as if we were bothersome for him. Walked past staff and said \"hi\" it's like they're not used to it. I come from Hawaii the staff there super awesome. I work in the service industry, guest needs to be treated with respect. We just ordered the drinks kept filled but being personable wasn't. Very disappointed I don't think I'd go back there again"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever visited a Cheesecake Factory, and they set the bar for me and my future visits. 

The Cheesecake Factory has a large selection of items on the menu, as well as a large selection of cheesecakes to choose from for dessert. Anything that you may feel to be in the mood for, they will have it from pastas, to burgers, to steaks. My personal favorite is the Hibachi Steak and I have many favorites for cheesecake, especially the Oreo cheesecake. You honestly can't go wrong eating at the Cheesecake Factory, and this location in the Premium Outlets North is generally pretty dead at night, especially after the mall closes, so it's the perfect place to eat at with a big group, or your date."}
{"text":"I don't care what y'all say. This place is just average. They give you huge portions, but the food isn't/aint nothing special.

I love the brownie and the chocolate cake though. Therefore, 3 Star!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory?!! This place is all things to all people but they are far different than these other establishments that try to please everyone. The other places lack in quality because they are trying too hard to offer too many mediocre dishes. This place has both quantity of menu items to choose from and they are prepared with quality as well.

Although your Vietnamese spring rolls or your sweet corm tamales aren't the most authentic you've ever had, they are pretty darn tasty. And I don't know about y'all but I'll take tasty over authenticity anytime. That's why I'm the only Asian you'll see at PF Chang's. Haha.

Today I was there for my friends bday. I just started eating clean--so to speak, so I ordered the most compliant item I could find and that was the Kobe burger. It had three ingredients. Very basic and consisting of: tomato, mushrooms, and grilled onion. I got it protein style of course. I normally would never, ever order a burger without cheese but I had to this time. For how plain it was I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It was Sofa King good! So flavorful with juices dripping out from the wrapper. I was not embarrassed to be heard slurping that stuff up. Not gonna waste any of that tasty burger grease. But please people, don't order a Kobe burger if it's gonna be hotter than med-rare. That's just a waste of good meat. If you're scared of a little pink in the middle, stick to your fast food burger joints. 

And of course...who doesn't order a cheesecake when they're at CCF? Me. Whomp, whomp. I had to stick with the bowl of strawberries. But for those that are not on a primal aka caveman aka paleo diet, they have just about any type of decadent combinations a (non-pregnant) person could think of. I will have to treat myself to one of these some other time in the distant future."}
{"text":"Food was good, waitress was great BUT when the workers started playing musical chairs and tables right next to me when I was trying to have dinner with my husband it got VERY ANNOYING. Not one worker apologized while putting their asses close to my food. This place seems busy every day of the week so I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"I like chains, what can I say I want something predictable. On vacation in Scottsdale we hit up the CF. The misses had the Crab Wontons for dinner. She loves the sauce. The little princess had the kids cheese pizza, that makes her happy. I had the Hibachi steak. The mushrooms, asparagus and wasabi mashed potatos are always filling."}
{"text":"My daughter has had a terrible experience the last two times she's been to the South Park Cheesecake Factory.  The first time the waiter spilled her fried zucchini and argued about getting more.  The second time she was overcharged for her meal.  We usually go several times a month, but with this horrible service we'll find another restaurant.  There are plenty to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"Service and food always consistent... Never a bad meal and never had anything twice .. just a great place."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory was really good. I got the Cuban Sandwich. It was good. Was a tad greasy though. I also got the red velvet cheesecake. Also was really good. Overall was good. I won't give it 5 stars though because of the wait times. It was good, but not worth a 2 hour wait."}
{"text":"You will need to decide if it's worth a three hour wait to get in. Clearly, it's testament to Cheesecake Factory's popularity, but I have never had to wait more than 45 minutes at a US based location. Canadians must have a serious hunger for good food. By the time we were seated, I had a pretty serious hunger!

Immediately, I ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls to take the edge off the hunger. They arrived fairly quickly based on the packed house. The wrapper was a bit soggy, and they had a bit of trouble holding together. 

For my main dish, I ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad at $24. A few bucks short of a Keg Classic Prime Rib, it was a very nice piece of sushi grade tuna, seared perfectly and then chilled. I ate the tuna and sliced avocado, and left the greens behind.  A pricey meal for what you get. 

Service was as good as it could be based on a packed house, but when a staff break came up, our section was added to another server's section and  we were largely forgotten. 

Love the food-won't be back. When the popularity wanes, and wait times drop to under an hour, I'll come back and try to pick up where I left off. In the meantime, I have lots of other incredible local options."}
{"text":"Just plain good.  I stopped in at Ceasars Palace location in the Forum for a quick lunch.  I am addicted to the Iced Mint Green Tea, and usually start with the Tuna Tartare.  For a non-sushi restaurant, it is not surprising to get a bad order of tuna that has been sitting around just a bit too long, but Cheesecake Factory has never let me down.

Today I deviated from my usual Garlic Shrimp Pasta, and tried the Enchiladas.  3 nicely done tortillas filled with chicken, and smothered in melted cheese, with a side of beans and cilantro rice.  Great fuel for the long walking distances in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had a wait to deal with, but mostly because we had a large party. We ate pretty well and enjoyed our food and drinks. Of course I loved the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Met the girls here for lunch - it was super convenient to get to and I love the new skinnylicious menu.  Lots of yummy options and, while I didnt have it, it even includes a low carb cheesecake.  Seared tuna salad for one of us, Greek salad for one, and grilled turkey burger with side salad for me.  All very good."}
{"text":"Brunch here is so good! The French toast is amazing- try the monte crisco! Traditional monte crisco with eggs covered in melted cheese served on French toast. Easily enough for two meals, as all their food is. I hate breakfast potatoes so they offered me a side of tomatoes instead which, for me, was perfect. I would have liked a fruit salad option but I thought the tomatoes were a unique and satisfying accompaniment. We don't come often because my husband doesn't like their dinner but I've never disliked a meal here. The chicken and garlic noodles is my favorite lunch/dinner dish. Service is always standard. The cheesecake is pricey but worth the occasional splurge!"}
{"text":"One of the better chain restaurants... not much into cake, but I hear from an impeccable source that theirs is to die for... the menu is huge, with varied selections.  Casual atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Just finished another meal here courtesy of a gift card.

This place is always busy and I've never been able to understand why. If no one ever gave me a gift card here, I would never eat here.

The service varies from very good to awful, but the food always never exceeds \"well, it didn't make me sick.\"

Today's meal failed even that low standard. As an appetizer I ordered some mini-corn dogs. I *love* corn dogs. At the fair, from Weinerschnitzel, from frozen at home, and so on.

These little balls of corn meal enriched pancake batter were deep fried to near burnt and yet managed to soak up enough grease to squeeze out nice puddle of oil. I only ate one, but within five minutes I was nauseas. 

The California omelet was not much better. Sour cream shouldn't curdle, right? The veggies and cheese were barely cooked.
It was more like a salad wrap, where the wrap happened to be egg.
If I had wanted a salad with egg, I'd have ordered a Cobb, not an omelet.

The banana cheese cake was good according to the spousal unit & I enjoyed my strawberry lemonade.

Still have $10 left on the gift card. I think that'll get me a couple of lemonades."}
{"text":"There will be a wait at this location... Very busy, i do t mind if everything is on point, but that is not the case here. For the prices asked the portions do not match up, i was still hungry at the end, but really why do we go there.... Wellllll duhhhhh..... The Cheesecake.... I was not disappointed"}
{"text":"The restaurant was worth the 30 minute wait! But then again I went on a Tuesday when it wasn't insanely busy!

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and it tasted pretty good but the portions were super huge I literally had to take the fries home with me because I couldn't finish it! My date ordered a burger on sourdough bread. He liked the burger but again like me he had to carry his leftovers home because it was super big!

I ordered the red velvet cheesecake there and it tasted like heaven! It wasn't too sweet but it was very rich and tasty and like my entrée I had to take part of the cheesecake home because I found it really big on the average dessert but it still tasted good and I'm happy that I did have leftovers :)


Nevertheless I would come back for the cheesecake definitely I would like to try the other flavours eventually and maybe dine there again once it's not super busy :)"}
{"text":"Ahhhh...YES! A restaurant inside a casino that is actually open PAST 11 pm!!  

Our group got seriously sidetracked after some gambling and realized that our afternoon of gambling turned into an EVENING of gambling.  We found our way to Caesar's Palace and we were so surprised that almost all the restaurants were closed!!

Thank goodness we found Cheesecake Factory at the very end of the forum shops.  We were seated immediately!  That was good news for my tired feet.

I ordered the bacon, cheese, mushroom and spinach omelet.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best that I've had either.

Service was good all the way up until the end.  We sort of lost our waiter when it came time to pay.  Where did he go?  So we just ended up having to pay cash.

If you don't want to go off the strip to search for a late night dinner spot and you are not craving fast food, Cheesecake Factory inside Caesar's Palace is your best bet!"}
{"text":"Not only am I fan of the cheesecake but also the food. As of late I've found myself sitting at or in the bar area so I don't have to wait for a seat. It seems this location is always busy. Happy hour is M-F 4-6pm with reduced price drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"I miss dining at Cheesecake Factory! Now that they opened nearby where I live I can go dining more often. Very good food at Cheesecake Factory and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I like going here for lunch. They offer many varieties and have a lot of selections for lunch specials. As big as their menu is, all the dishes I've ordered here end up tasting good. I almost always have enough leftover for dinner too. For the price and the portion you get, it's a good value. Service is decent. They can be a bit slow when they're super busy and being in the outlet, they're usually busy. However, I've never had major problems with the service. If you don't want to wait to be seated, you can seat yourself in the bar area as those seatings are on a first come first serve basis. Love their wheat bread and they will gladly give you extra if you ask. My favorite dish here is their miso salmon. They also offer great happy hour. Definitely worth checking out when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice food, friendly service, low prices, nice drinks, cool atmosfere,not bad for a early dinner!!"}
{"text":"Nice meal , service could be better, but they were very short in staff, no busser around, cant get same more bread, food come out fast!! We have to wait 15 min for a table, but is ok."}
{"text":"This was a typical visit to a big chain restaurant.  Food was good as usual.  We did have a trainee as our server and he was very nervous.  We had some fun with him and made him loosen up a little.  I'm sure he passed his test, but you need to keep it light.  This place was slamming busy on a Wednesday night with a short wait during the dinner rush hour.  We'll go back again when we're in town."}
{"text":"Cheese cake factory at Yorkdale mall becomes very hectic and busy filled with human traffic. Me and my friend waited for 2 hours. Honestly, If I were to rate this from 1-10 I would give it a 2 for time consuming. The wait is too long and if you think its worth it give it a go. The food is not bad but can be pricy depending on what you order. I specifically find that the cakes they sell is super sweet for me, not my cup of tea. Overall the experience is ok. I would recommend the meals but not the cake if you are not much of a sweet tooth like me. No hate though."}
{"text":"We were told the wait would be 1 hour and as of right now, we are at two and a half hours. They kept telling us ten minutes. They just said we were waiting on one table to finish their meal this while time! Why not seat us on a different table. People coming in after us all got seated and we are now the only ones left."}
{"text":"Great food, Great people! My pasta carbonara was just a lil but oily, but the mushrooms were so tasty! Steak was ewwwwk! The bread was freshly made. The wait for the food is not too bad, just expect it since the location is at the outlet so it's busy. Overall the experience was good!"}
{"text":"Had a family style lunch to celebrate a birthday on a busy Saturday.  They were very accommodating for a large party of 8.  We waited 15 minutes for a table.  Our waiter was very nice and attended to all our needs.  We enjoyed all the food and the cheesecake is always amazing!  I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp with brown rice.  Portion was delicious, but  super huge could only finish half.  At end of meal, a kalua cocoa coffee cheesecake was served for birthday celebrant.  That cheesecake was awesome, it was gone before a photo could be taken!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is pretty much always on point at The Cheesecake Factory. It just depends on what you prefer. My favorites are the fresh banana cream, the tiramisu, and the red velvet cheesecake. If you go for a meal, their portions are always pretty big. You'll definitely have to take food home. The menu is huge, so it might be a good idea to check it out online before you go, especially if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Cheesecake is delicious. Very creamy and soft. The pasta in this place is not that bad as well. Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a hard one because their food is so good and in such large portions but everytime I've been there the service is really slow and crappy.

Was there for dinner on Monday and whilst there wasn't many people in there we still had to wait about 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 to order the appetizer... with our food btw.

But their bread rocks at the beginning of the meal and the chicken marsalla is so awesome as is the goulash and mostly everything else.  The cheesecake is the best i've ever had even though I don't get it everytime... not a huge sweets guy but it is really good.

I'd still say go but be patient..."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong here! They have such a wide selection yet nothing falls short! I've had the chicken pasta the past two times because it's so good! For not being specifically catered to Italian food it's the best I've had even over Italian restaurants! So much flavor and just great overall quality! I'm not big on expensive classy restaurants but I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I'll make this short and simple. The wait time was not very bad for a pre-4th of July dinner eating. Only had to wait 45 minutes or so. The food is good, just like and Cheesecake Factory that I have been to...Wait, it's Cheesecake Factory, the food is AWESOME! The only reason that I am giving this 4 stars and not five is that we had an annoying waiter and waitress issue at the beginning of our service. There were 4 people that saw us in the first 10 minutes of being there. We ordered drinks with 3 different people and then almost ordered dinner with two people. Finally when we got our waitress she was awesome!

I got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, awesome as usual! P.S. I need to try something new next time. I got the chocolate cake, 5 stars for that! It even tasted better the next day!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! If you're on a date, having a girls outing, a family meal or a business meeting it can all be done here!! Always clean, always a great experience. The menu is rather large so it takes a while to decide on a meal. BUT... You will not be disappointed with whatever you chose. I've enjoyed every selection so far. You definitely want to do yourself a favor and order the Red Velvet Cheesecake to round off your meal. It is my go to dessert. I normally order it togo because the portions are huge and I don't wanna be knocked out in a booth. Please do yourself a favor and get there if you haven't already!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner date! The place was packed so I was a little worried, but our server was on top of it the whole time! I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad (5 stars), and my boyfriend had garlic noodles with shrimp (5 stars)! And to top it off we shared a piece of Craig's carrot cake cheesecake! It was to die for! All-in-all A++"}
{"text":"Super slow service. Our whole experience took over an hour and we kept ordering ahead of each course. We wanted to order cheesecake, but then decided against it because every course, from drinks to apps and then food took FOREVER!"}
{"text":"Went with friends on visit to Phoenix Camelback location
Food was marginal
Salad dressing was off maybe over cooked
Eggplant was but little taste
Salmon was overlooked 
Too expensive a meal to not have the taste right
Service was very slow"}
{"text":"I have been to many Cheesecake Factories all over the country and this particular location seems to always hit the mark in the food department. I usually order either steak with mash potatoes or a pasta and they always come out good!

The only two things that I have a gripe about are the wait times and that annoying creepy dragon that comes out of the aquarium every 20 min and shoots out flames. They really need to remove that because it's ear piercingly loud and gets annoying after the first time you hear it."}
{"text":"The WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I came here on a Monday night (tonight) with 3 other girls. Our waiter was absolutely amazing however, one person was served 10 minutes before the 2nd person was served, and myself and one other member of our party had to wait another 5 minutes after the 2nd person received their dish. The people serving the food was not our waiter. Our burgers and fries were cold to the touch and my sweet potato fries were completely burnt; black. 

When I brought this to the manager's attention, he simply said \"oh, I know why that happened thanks for telling me, have a good night.\" Im assuming he dismissed us because we were kind instead of aggressive and rude, and because we're girls in our 20s who look a lot younger.

 We spent $200 on a meal we waited 3 hours for, received it cold, kindly brought it to the managers attention while complimenting our amazing waiter, and yet he dismissed us by assuming he knew exactly what went wrong and that it wasn't a problem. He didn't explain what he meant by that at all. I don't understand, is this a common thing here? Is it normal to serve black fries? And then proceeded to send us off ass if our feedback was not valued at all. What a disgusting way to run an establishment. I won't be back. Michael and Clark were the managers on the floor. Maybe consider running an in-service for them on customer service.

{"text":"I've got to downgrade my original review after today. 

We were seated in the bermuda triangle. We waited 15 minutes for a server to show up, apologize profusely then disappeared for another 15 minutes.  That was the theme for this meal. Sorry for the wait, now wait some more. 

Glad they finally got a printed kids menu.

Kids pizza was extra greasy, came out 25 minutes before my entree salad. For almost $17 I was hard pressed to find any chicken or bacon in my chopped Cobb salad. Zero blue cheese. I would have told the server but he disappeared until it was time to flag him down for our bill, which took him two passes by our table to drop off. Thank goodness I had correct change so I didn't have to endure another 1/2 assed apology/long wait.

blah!"}
{"text":"This place rocks my world! I have been here so many times and I've always had an awesome Expierence. The food the drinks, everything is so tasty and well done. It feels like a magic trick that the menu is so big but always executed so well. I try to get something new every time I go. The venue is always clean, the lighting is perfect, I love the ambiance of it all. Perfect for a date night or any night. Dress up or dress casual it all works here. Don't even get me started on the cheesecake!! Ugh get in my belly."}
{"text":"I know this is chain restaurant and have eaten at Coral Gables & Aventura locations several times but this Cheesecake is located inside the Cesar's Forum shops where diners can watch the Fall of Atlantis show for free. We sat on the terrace and it was great for people watching.

Ordered the Smoke House BBQ burger (Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Onion Strings, Ranch BBQ). This burger was pretty enormous and mighty tasty. Bacon & onion rings were crispy. The patty was juicy medium. It came with fries so this was definitely a filling lunch for $12. My friend got the Factory Burger and said that it was also good.

Service was swift and polite. Got seated in 5 minutes and food came in a timely manner. We were there on a Monday so weekends are probably a lot busier from reading other reviews."}
{"text":"I came here to have a Christmas dinner for work and the hostess greeted us right away and told us it would be about 20 minutes because we arrived early. She was kind enough to keep us updated on our tables and they would take us back shortly. As soon as we were taken to our table our waitress greeted us and asked for our drink selection. Considering there was 13 of us the drinks came out really fast and no mistakes. She then took all of our orders and was very friendly. I ordered the filet mignon medium with veggies and mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked exactly as i ordered and let me say i cleaned off the plate. We all then ordered cheesecake to go and they have an extensive selection on cheesecakes. That by far was the hardest part to decide which one i wanted. I really enjoyed it here and will be back to try other foods from their endless menu choices. 

This location in particular can validate your parking so make sure to take your chip in with you."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service was excellent (thanks Bernardo) but they are so disorganized at the front door it's not worth going to this location when they are busy. We got there early 6pm but I'm warning you, if you see a line, get back on Yelp and find another place to go or commit yourself to waiting double or triple the time they tell you. Some may think the food is worth the wait, but it's Las Vegas- there are many, many restaurants to choose from. 

Everyone in my party complained about the lighting and I noticed people at other tables using their cellphone lights to read the menu. The general experience was so annoying we took our cheesecake home. We had someone in town and I regret spending two hours there. Our server was so good it probably deserves another star, but the first impression really ruined it for me."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It was love at first bite for my partner and I, and we have made it a must in every trip we have made to Phoenix.

- The ambiance is very nice with subdued lighting and nice background music. Staff was always been very attentive and corteous.
- Portions are generous and packed with flavor (so far I have only ordered something I didn't fully like). This last time I got the Chicken Bellagio and my partner got the Pasta Carbonara, which were LIFE giving. We had plenty of left overs to prolong our Cheesecake Factory reverie the next day.
- the cheesecakes are always fantastic. I got the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and my partner got the Adam's Peanut Butter cup cheesecake. Very decadent and rich in consistency.

The prices are a bit high, but it's the CF. You don't go to be all dietetic and stingy. All in all it has become one of the best chain restaurants I have ever visited."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Orange Chicken I've had. Delicious. The flavor is just right, not over powering with ginger or spice. The brown rice is so good. You get a huge scoop of it and I never finish it anytime I go. The bread and butter, yum!  I really don't think you can get a bad thing on the menu. One thing I found interesting is the Arnold Palmers are made with Pink Lemonade. Isn't it supposed to be yellow lemonade you use??  I don't know, thought that was weird. I never have room for the cheesecake thou! Always leave stuffed!  Thanks Cheesecake Factory! One reason I left four stars rather than give this time was because my entree was not delivered with the rest of my parties entrees. So they all started eating before I received my food."}
{"text":"I like the Cheesecake Factory for a multitude of reasons.  It is right outside of my window pretty much, no matter what I am in the mood for, they have something that can meet my hunger needs, and the service overall is great.  

I have tried numerous things here and have seldom been disappointed.  From  their mixed drinks (Yum on the Strawberry Martini)  to their apps (my personal faves are the sweet corn tamale cakes and the factory nachos now- thanks to my husband for the love of the nachos), and their huge variety of well, EVERYTHING.  

The only problems with this place are when you have such a variety, you may do a lot of things well, but not great... and this is the case here.  Although I have never had an awful experience, I have never been completely wowed.  The wait is always bad too.   I just think if I am going to have to wait that long, there are probably a lot of better places I can go to."}
{"text":"Like I have said before, this is a chain restaurant, the menu is the same anywhere you go, the food tastes the same, the decor is the same, the dinning experience, is not always the same.

While on our vacation, our group of friends had come up with a scavenger hunt of sorts where we were supposed to do certain dares. One of these dares was to eat food off of the plate of someone you did not know. Enter: the Cheesecake Factory. One of my friends decided to take this dare on and noticed a family getting up from their meal (children included). They had left some plates of half-eaten cheesecake on their table and she saw this as her opportunity.

Before the family had even left, she walked up, picked up a fork and took a big bite of their cheesecake, smiled and walked back to our table. The looks on their faces were victory enough.

I'm pretty sure the rest of our meal involved specialty drinks from their bar so I can't accurately comment on the food, or really anything else that happened. ;)"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best but what I can't wrap my head around is this; why do the curb side workers that answer the phones don't know what's in the menu items (for allergies purposes) and have such thick accents you can't understand them, then you hear them yelling in Spanish in the background. Crazy"}
{"text":"Hit the horrible service trifecta. Place is crazy busy. Our server, Melissa J, is super rude and snotty. Bailey asked for a plain bacon cheeseburger- she told him to look at the menu because they don't come plain and for him to tell her item by item what he DIDN'T WANT on his burger. What part of plain is so hard. I looked at her and said \"plain\" meat cheese and bacon. Got another snotty comment. 

Now I know why I hate this place. Thought I would give it another chance, figured a couple of years gave them enough time to get their crap together. guess not!

Server should thank her lucky stars she doesn't work for me - cuz she would be on the street quicker that you can say fired!

Server heard the kids talking about me writing the monster of a bad review, so she stood around when his burger was delivered and asked if it was plain enough! Seriously!"}

{"text":"Had the Greek Salad as an appetizer and the Ahi Tuna as the entree. The food was delicious, but a little expensive for what you get. Service was average and the seating was strange as it was arranged so close to other parties. Cheesecake was tasty for bought in frozen!"}
{"text":"Great food, servers were very nice and attentive. Excellent bar menu with professional bartenders, overall it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely be back. Love that they don't offer in Wi-Fi for customers so people can enjoy more family time"}
{"text":"Been here 50 times since I live down the street and only dissapointed once from the nachos, but that was my fault but everything else is amazzing"}
{"text":"To be honest I used to live off the best menu item which was the juicy portabella mushroom burger, I would pick it up for lunch at least 3x per week, in addition to going there for dinner....a total addiction until they took it off the menu. That's ok, I needed a change. I love the Thai lettuce wraps with peanut dressing that's another serious addiction. The sweet Hawaiian salad tastes like candy. All of the salads are among the best salads you can get anywhere. The Chicken Marsala is fantastic. The simple four cheese pasta is crack. Oh the salmon rice dish with a light lemon sauce will fill you up yet you'll feel good. Those suggested pasta dishes are really good. Steak and ribs was ok, yet I order that at a stake house. Fish and chips yummy. Burgers are fantastic. The size of the burrito reminds you of your first born child. So again, I'll admit when I lived down the street at the Biltmore Estates I went here for dinner at least 4x per week at my sons request. But it's always nice and quiet, easy to have great conversations.  Consistent quality food, tons of variety to satisfy everyone's  tastes. Esp great when you don't feel like doing dishes. The appetizers are all very good as well."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is always great and most dishes!  Tonite service was a little slow when i finally got seated.  The bar service was excellent!   Do not get nachos!! Ordered chicken it had maybe 10 little pieces of chicken a dab of sour cream a little more guac No beans very little cheese!  Basically got chips!! Will not order again! Calamari appetizer was excellent!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake is always a good standby.  huge selection, good food and cocktails - everyone can find something here.  i love the thai lettuce wraps - app is big enough for a meal!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Try the blue cheese dressing."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory that didn't deserve 5 stars. Yes, they're pricy but they're always well worth it. My waitress was a young girl (I feel bad I forgot her name) but she was sweet and fun to talk to. Great service. 

I took myself to the Southside location recently after a long day of shopping and was sat right away. Restaurant is always clean, comfortable, has friendly staff members, and DELICIOUS! 

I can only imagine how lame it sounds to say that the free bread appetizer is my favorite part every time I come in, but really it is. I always look forward to it.

I ordered the tomato basil pasta dish and it was phenomenal, just heated up the leftovers tonight for dinner and it tasted just as good. Of course, I also enjoyed some cheesecake for dessert (strawberry this time around), and I swear they have the best cheesecake on this earth. I have never been let down by the Cheesecake Factory and I know I'll be back many times in my life. 

Use to be one of my favorite date night spots and their sirloin with mashed potatoes is some of the best steak I've had in a long time that was under $40. Keep it up Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Worst Cheesecake Factory that I've ever been to. Normally this is one of my favorite restaurants but this one was certainly not up to par. They sat us in a booth and there were flies everywhere buzzing me and my wife's head the whole time we were there. I would hate to see what the kitchen looks like. By the time I left I was disgusted. This isn't a McDonalds and we aren't eating $1 cheeseburgers folks. Not good!"}
{"text":"Extremely overrated

I went on a Saturday morning for bring at 10:30am there was a wait for the dining room but the high tables at the bar were open so I sat there.

The waiter was full of life a little lost but still fun.

I ordered the chicken and waffle Benedict's. The egg was poached perfectly but I couldn't taste them because of the thick over powering hollandaise sauce. The waffles were fluffy but again lost in the sauce and the chicken taste like your average chicken fingers.  The home fries were okay.


I did order the Hershey crunch cheesecake to go. Now that was delicious I would definitely recommend trying the cheesecake such rich and creamy flavors. Unfortunately the cake turned over and I didn't get a good picture of it."}
{"text":"We normally get take out because we don't like going there with kids.  I went to order (walk in) at 3:45 in the afternoon.  The woman took my order and told me it would only be about 15 mins. (I ordered 2 chicken salads and a piece of cheesecake).  I sat around for about 25 min. and was a little annoyed with the extra time because a large amount of the staff was standing around.  When my order came out, the woman who was at the bakery was easily the hardest working person at the time.  She was apologetic for my order taking extra time and gave me an extra piece of cheesecake at no additional cost.  I was very appreciative of this since I didn't ask for it.  She said it was the least they could do for making me wait longer.  We were very satisfied with this level of customer service.  Everything was good and we enjoyed our meal.  

The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that this woman was killing herself at the bakery doing orders left and right while there were several other staff members standing around the bakery watching her work, not offering help, and at times they even seemed not aware that there were customers standing 5 feet away from them."}
{"text":"Giving a perspective of somebody who has never been to any cheesecake factory ever and have never tried their cheesecakes.

We did a takeout for cheesecake on an evening. We got two cheesecakes and I didn't like any of them. We got Red Velvet and Peanut something and I found both of them to be overly sweet, the sugar took all the flavour and none of the other flavours could thrive.

Going by my previous experiences with cheesecake, I am under the impression that every good cheesecake has a sour touch to it, its the balance of sweet and a little sour that makes the cheesecake tasty to me but I didn't find that taste in any of the offerings that I have tried."}
{"text":"So...my wife and I have been avoiding this place like the plague for a few years.  We had gone a few times after it first opened, and generally, we were disappointed.  The sheer size of the menu should be a red flag for anyone anticipating an enjoyable dining experience.  Jack of all trades, master of none.

Having said that, with a $50 gift card in tow, we decided to take the kids and give it a shot.

The food was okay...my wife was not terribly impressed with her salad, and the corn dogs my girls ordered had a very strong flavor due to the fact that they use all beef kosher dogs.  Considering who is eating them, I would recommend using a more traditional dog instead.  I ordered the fried mac & cheese burger (curiosity, mostly), and it was decent.

The good news is that the service was friendly and relatively on top of things.

Honestly, The Cheesecake Factory is too expensive for what it offers, and while I know some people are impressed by the place, I don't see us coming back anytime soon...unless we get another gift card."}
{"text":"I love this location.  THey are always friendly and the food is well done. I love the Steak Diane and they will customize it with less pepper they way I like it.  THe mashed are so good."}
{"text":"I visited this Cheesecake Factory on vacation from L.A., and was looking forward to it as I always do.  Unfortunately the service was not good at all this time around.  Our waitress most of the time was nowhere to be found and had a non caring attitude.  And without being long winded...she wasn't the only one there.  I really lime the location and hope that the next time I'm there on vacation that the service will be much better."}
{"text":"The dish I had, the wasabi crusted ahi tuna was awful and it was served twice, both times unacceptably.  The \"crust\" is really bread stuffing on the outside and the miso glaze was a miso cream sauce, huh?  How can you call a rich, greasy sauce served on the plate a glaze.  Very confusing, unappetizing and this dish should be chopped.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch and had the philly cheese steak. The menu is huge and you will have plenty of good food to choose from."}
{"text":"Somewhat surprisingly, the bathrooms were dirty, but that was probably just due to a lazy janitor.  Other than that, the place is great.  The food is really good, better than other Cheesecake Factories in my opinion.  The lunch deals before 5 PM are a particularly good value."}
{"text":"I've visited this location several times during lunch hour between 1pm - 2pm.  Service has always been fast and courteous.  Always get the Cobb salad, super delicious.  Portion sizes are large here."}
{"text":"In response to the individual that responded to my comment. If you didn't notice, the picture I posted along with my comment was that of a drink napkin that had been given to us that was, in fact used prior to our receiving it. Specifically, the napkin had notes of some s1ort written on it. We expect that the cheesecake factory uses a laundering service for their napkins because they are quality linen. Thanks for the response though!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory  and we don't have one where I live so it's always a treat to go to one when you are on vacation.  The menu is huge, the portions are big and the food is amazing.  
It was my first visit to this location in Vegas and it was a great experience.  It's seemed less busy than the others in town and the staff was just pleasant and wonderful.
I definitely recommend!  ...and try to save room for Cheesecake!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Chapter 1 - Appetizers, point is; I don't need an encyclopedia of the world's cuisine on one menu.  I'm hungry and tell me what you serve and are your signature dish - that's all I want.  As you can see I'm not a big fan of restaurants with more on their menu than the number of mistresses of Tiger Woods (Ouch! Sorry Tiger you left yourself open for that one!).  Regardless, I always appreciate the service at the Factory.  Food-wise, I'm generally lost after chapter 2 - Side Salad or Soup?  I just close my eyes and choose and sometimes I win and sometimes, well better luck!  The ambience of the Factory is always pleasing - loud and dark almost like a rollercoaster in Space Mountain except I'm not screaming my head off - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I last frequented The Cheesecake Factory.  We went on a Tuesday evening around 6:15 and got immediately seated.  Our waiter was excellent.  He brought our drinks quickly followed by bread and butter.  The wife ordered the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken and I tried the Chicken Madeira. Both dishes were really good!  Dinner was followed with a piece of Key-lime cheese cake.  I'm not sure why we haven't been here in a while, but we certainly plan on returning soon.  FYI, there were a couple dozen people waiting to be seated when we exited after 7:00 PM."}
{"text":"First timer! What a great restaurant, food and service was perfect. I had the Pit Beef Dip, just excellent. Of course I had to try the cheesecake, not bad at all. What a great experience"}
{"text":"Made reservations and were seated right away. Parking was a little difficult, but we managed to find a spot in the parking garage. It was my boyfriend's birthday so the staff brought out a cheesecake, decorated it, and sang  the food was delicious we ordered steak and the pasta napoletana. Would definitely come back and wasn't too expensive"}
{"text":"Best place to eat on the Southside of Pittsburgh... We are always getting gift cards to this place, but always seem to leave them at home. There's always a wait of 30-45 minutes here, so don't be in a hurry when you arrive... Parking is always an issue, download the Pittsburgh parking APP and save yourself a headache... The best advice I can give a party of 4 or less, there's a 1st come 1st serve policy on the hightop tables in the bar area... We've avoided long lines many times by grabbing one as people were leaving... We've never ordered anything on their extensive menu that was disappointing!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, and it's not \"cool\" to review chains, but whatever, we had a good experience, so I'm going to let people thinking about eating there know... :P 

We experienced the Cheesecake Factory's Happy Hour, and ooooh what a happy hour it is. Probably the best happy hour I've encountered in a very long while. Everything that's normally well over $12 is $5, so we went crazy and ordered a plethora of things, and they were all good. Plus, with the look of the place, you really feel like you're doing some fine dining. Oh, and our server took good care of us. We'll return."}
{"text":"I adore CF's Thai Lettuce wraps.  It's an appetizer but filling enough for a meal and the sauces that accompany the chicken satay are amazing!  

All in all I don't usually go for anything else on the menu.  My husband likes the Louisiana chicken and we both like the fresh bread served as an appetizer.  CF is usually crowded and loud.  But the service is typically good and the portion sizes are huge!"}
{"text":"Whenever we come here as a family we all leave happy because as you know there is truly something for everyone here.

My top picks:

Thai chicken lettuce wraps (this makes it in my top 5 favorites). I love how fresh everything is.  The satay chicken is perfection.  The sauces are incredible.  I could lick the tamarind cashew, wait I DO lick it...

The fried zucchini and garlic ranch is delicious.

The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is so creamy and yummy."}
{"text":"It seems the rest of the world had the same idea as we did to order takeout for Valentines Day.  Although we were sorely disappointed and elements of our large order were missing or wrong, I understood because I've never ever seen Cheesecake factory so busy with so many to go orders and couples dining in.  It was mayhem!  Although our order was wrong; the customer service was fantastic and when I called this morning to express my concerns about my order.  I spoke with the manager Chris.  Chris was a lovely, soft spoken and kind man who immediately expressed concern and offered a solution.  It was fantastic to be greeted by someone so adept at listening to and satisfying customers.  Because of this and because the food is \"usually\" spectacular, I'm offering this 5 star rating.  Mistakes happen, especially on nights when business is out of control but how a restaurant (and more importantly the Manager) handles the mistakes is what separates good from great.  Well done Chris, and well done CF."}
{"text":"Everytime I have come here, I have never had a problem. 

I have only sat in the bar area because service is quick and I have never had to wait for a seat. So, can't really tell you much about the dining room seating other then there are always people waiting.

Cheesecake Factory has almost anything you could be craving from seafood to steak to great pasta and it's usually ALL good. And, as always their cheesecake is always fresh and tasty. 

For Boca Park it can get busy, but as mentioned, if you don't mind the bar, hit it up for quicker seating and service."}
{"text":"Over priced and staff is friendly... I really think the cheese cake is the best part of the restaurant not the food"}
{"text":"If I had to sum up my many experiences at this Cheesecake Factory in only a few words I would say they consistently exceed my expectations and delivering excellent meals and service with a large menu.

I have never ordered anything that I didn't completely enjoy and the portions are enormous.

The chicken buffalo pastry app is fantastic as is the southwest egg roll."}
{"text":"Despite being adamant that I did not want to sit at the tables outside the restaurant as the show was going on and carrying on a conversation would be impossible, the hostess assured me that this was the final two minutes of the show.  I again said that I was not happy with how noisy it was but was again assured the show was concluding.  After waiting for our beverages and sending back the cutlery that had old food on them, our dinner arrived.  As we considered another glass of wine or dessert the intolerable noise of the show started again. We instantly made our wine or dessert choice and stood to leave. As I searched for the hostess to get her explanation that after I obviously hadn't wanted to sit in the area while the show was on that she insisted but hadn't said it would restart in one hour she was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that cheesecake factory could make the Cuban sandwich taste so good.  My husband and I split it, not knowing if we would like it or not, but all the flavors went so well together.  Next time I go there, there won't be any sharing :)
Also, their mango keyline cheesecake was delicious. It has a bit of bitterness with the combination of sweetness, the flavors played so well with each other.  It's a must of you like Mango and Key lime."}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory. The opening of this location was overly hyped in Canada. Even months later, it is still busy. It is convenient that it's located inside Yorkdale mall. Luckily, they have created the concept of giving you a buzzer if there is a wait for a table, so you can enjoy your time shopping in the mall instead of waiting in a long line to be seated.

The portions are big! These plates are meant to be shared, especially for the price too. They are very expensive (20+ a plate). Not knowing this, I had lots of food left over to take home, and so did my friends. 
I personally love cheesecake, it is my all-time favorite, and having a two-sided menu full of different flavors was heaven on earth. I kept it plain and simple. Strawberry cheesecake with whip cream on the side. So good!

I wouldn't come back anytime soon. It's not something I'd be craving for, but if it's your first time, and you are hestitating to go , it is definitely worth a try to formulate your own opinion!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place. The waiting wasnt as bad since it was on a Monday (around afternoon), although it was STILL busy. I just personally wouldn't dare nor recommend you go here on a weekend unless you don't mind the wait. 

Upon being there, I noticed if you get seated near the bar area there are a lot of available seats available compared to the lounge area. So you definitely get served right away. 

For food, I ordered the famous cajun pasta and it was honestly good, not a fan for the type of pasta noodles used in it but it was quite tasty nonetheless. I guess I would get it again. The cheesecake though, in my opinion, has to be the highlight for sure. I do recommend you try the Hershey cheesecake (my personal fav) if you adore chocolate as much as I do.

Overall, whether its a hype or not.. I personally enjoyed it with my family. There was too many on the menu to try so its all preference by the end of the day. 

fyi, if you have a stroller, they usually have you place it near the entrance of the restaurant inside the mall. I do appreciate how they try to accommodate the needs of their customers."}
{"text":"Large menu, many choices never go wrong!! Short wait and good service and very generic menu good all over the country :)"}
{"text":"Went there with my gal pals for a birthday bash.  Veronica (or was it Victoria??) was our server.    Very friendly, competent, and professional.   Since it was happy hour, we decided to try a few of their appetizers:   fried mac and cheese, pot stickers, buffalo blasts, sweet corn tamale cakes, egg roll sampler.   Huge quantities of each, to say the least.    If anything CF has going for it, it is the size of the servings and the menu selection.   I thought everything was over-fried and rather bland.   I mean, I love mac and cheese, but it was over-fried and hard.   The buffalo blasts were all batter, ughhh, could barely handle the tamale cake, couldn't say anything positive about the egg rolls, and the pot stickers were hard.   I am only giving it two stars instead of one because of the server and the cheesecake.   Our birthday gal did get a piece of cheesecake and we all had a few tastes of it.   Now, that was yummmmy!!   Would I go back?   Not if I can help it!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times but honestly, I don't have much to say, good or bad. Nothing really stands out to me about the food, I usually order a sandwich. I'm not much of a cheesecake person per say, but they definitely have lots of choices. There's even gluten free cheesecakes, which is good for those with diet restrictions. I do like the location, air conditioned & comfortable. I've never had to wait long to be seated either, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed in our visit here.  Have been to many of their restaurants and they are typically about 4 stars.  Went here for my daughter's birthday in early January.  Had to wait 40 minutes on a Saturday night but were able to get some drinks and hang out at the bar.  Was somewhat surprised how expensive the drinks were but we were celebrating.  After waiting 40 minutes the best they could do was cram our party of 5 into a 4 top in the very back corner of the restaurant.  We made the best of it but why even have tables if the experience is less than the best.  Best thing we could say about this table was it was close to the bathroom.  Service was OK but the food was not good.  Probably should have sent it back but by the time we got it we had been there over an hour and a half.  My wife's hamburger was over charred to the level it was charcoal.  My dinner was tasteless and nobody was overly excited about what they had.  5 different dinners and all were at best average and 2 were poor.  Quantity is typically good but for what we ordered this time even that wasn't above average.  Total bill for 5 people was about $250 including drinks and tip.  For that kind of bill, I expect much more.  I don't expect to go back again.  Too many good restaurants to waste money on overpriced food, that isn't good and where they don't take reservations and a 90 minute meal stretches into 2 1/2 hours."}
{"text":"The food is always good here, and I knew coming on a Saturday night would require a wait. We got seated in about 15 minutes, then had to wait another 10 for our waiter to check on us for our order. We had to wait about 30ish minutes for food, when our waiter came to tell us they dropped our food on the floor (try explaining that to a hangry 6 year old) and they would be remaking it asap. Anyways, the manager comes over about 5 minutes later and apologizes for the inconvenience and offers to refill our drinks for us. So another 45 minutes pass, we get our food and the bill, and I was just a little disappointed to see them charge us for the \"birthday cheesecake\" we received, and all the refills of the drinks the manager offered us. I get that I could have clarified, but from a huge chain I would have at least hoped when the manager came by to offer us refills since we were so \"inconvenienced\", that they would have been comped, or at least the damn \"birthday\" cheesecake after making us wait another 30 minutes for our food. Just a note - this review isn't about the money, it's just a shame to see that a huge chain like this wasn't more willing to appreciate their customers, they were only concerned with the turnover. Probably won't be back here, although the staff doesn't care anyways"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in The Cheescake Factory.

I called it at about 11:20 am and place a to go order and was given the pick up time of 20 mins.
i get there at about 12:00 (36 mins later) hoping my food wasn't too cold after i got caught up in traffic. I get in there and start getting ringed up by a man in all black I'm assuming he was a manager and he starts looking for my ticket at the counter and i could tell he didn't find it he then comes back to the cash register and mumbles something to the employee next to him starts putting in my order prints out a ticket and looks at me and says \"he will take care of you\" and walks torwards the kitchen with my ticket. The gentlemen who was then ringing me up says \"they are still working on your order\" and i asked \"do you know about how long?\" and he responds \"let me go check\" after chatting up a storm with other employees he goes to the kitchen and comes back and says \"5-6 mins\".


 I did not get my food until 12:12 pm!!! Almost a whole hour after i ordered. I get to my office and my plate looks so disappointing was not even worth waiting for.

Never again cheescake factory, never again!"}
{"text":"So I think make my \"Monday Night\" an easy work week night and get take out from Cheesecake Factory. Boy was that a wrong call especially since this is their slowest night! So I complete and pay for my order by 8:01 and was quoted 20 to 25 mins and waited until 8:42 at which point I asked the same take out cashier who had rang me up what was going on she replies waiting on fries and I said well you told me 20 to 25 she replies back I said 25 to 30 I said no but let's go with that then what's taking an extra 15 by the time that banter is done she had no answer except would you like me to get a manager and I replied yes that and the food you said would be ready within the 30 minutes that's now 45 so I wait for him ( Adrian) I believe was his name and after watching him deal with another customer to whole he gave a free slice of cheesecake because I'm guessing resolving yet another dissatisfied customer I unleash a flurry of choice words on their lack of customer service and kitchen performance because 2 hamburgers and a couple of salads do not take 1 hr worth of prepping because the prep boy that came in at 6am already chopped everything up and it's a matter of putting it all in a box. Meanwhile I have a viewership because I have become irate over the lack of concern as the store manager I believe Brandon to be was just watching with a blank stare and I ask him what's he doing and he states just listening to you didn't want to interrupt so I said you'll have to cause I'm long winded. Had nothing to offer so I had him go chase for his business card so I can call corporate or at least email them with first hand insight to their Monday night standards and hope they can improve on it. See the things that makes me so mad, irate or just blow my lid is unlike most people that complain I wasn't looking for \"free\" anything as I always reject such option. That's a band aid on an open wound. What I want is for you to take the time and go look into the issue and fix it and not give me this blank stare like you are surprised to see a customer so upset over a couple of burgers taking an hr to be made. Are you freaking kidding me! I've seen junior chefs make complete meals in an hr and yours can sling out some burgers in 30 mins. Time for training session or new cooks. They're a dime a dozen I'm guessing since it's not a restaurant where you have the liberty to make your menu as you go. Hope this helps you Brandon with what the issue was and you jump on it and get it taken care of. I know it's not the first time service has been lack luster and that's putting it mildly! And to all the staff just being a spectator on the conversation it makes sense why your operation was lacking and why the customer before me got a free dessert from you!"}
{"text":"When we got here we were spoken to right away which was nice. We waited about 5 minutes before being seated. The waitress was very nice. For appetizers we had buffalo wings and fried zucchini. The wings were very good and the zucchini was average, not a lot of flavor. I had a Patron margarita on the rocks and it was one of the best I have had. My boyfriend had a mango margarita frozen and it was okay. I ordered the fish tacos and they were extremely bland I had to send them back. I was very disappointed in them. Even the rice and beans were not that good.He had a cheeseburger which he said he liked. I got a slice of Godiva chocolate cheesecake to go and I loved it.
We sat at a booth which was stiff as a rock. If I do come back it'll be for the margarita and the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory.  Every location I've been, wether in Chicago, Phoenix, Orange County, I've never been disappointed.  Their Salads are always fresh and rich with quality.  My go to dish is the Romano Crusted Chicken.  A rich, buttery sensational taste that is not for the calorie conscious, but that's what it takes to get flavor in any dish.   Lately, I've been enjoying their burgers.  Today I had the Classic burger which was simply one of the better burgers I've ever had.  A side of blue cheese smothered salad and I was in heaven.  Service always depends on the server you get.  Sometimes it is very good and sometimes it's meh! Only once in Chicago I would say I had a bad experience, the rest have been very good. So, if you're not one of those that simply won't step foot in a chain restaurant, I think the Cheesecake Factory is an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a gift card from Christmas that we finally used. The service at this location is the best of any Cheesecake Factory I have ever been into. It was so great that we raved about our server to the General Manager, Lin. 

I had the usual-- cajun jambalaya pasta. It's amazing every time, and my go to when I order from Cheesecake.

We ordered a bottle of wine, had a fantastic time, and will be back as soon as we can for the service alone."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The menu is amazing...anything and everything is on the menu.  I got the skinny salad....which was amazing.  I think it was only 240 calories.  Tasted like 1240 calories... We did not get any cheesecake, but I do recommend it if you eat here."}
{"text":"Great food and an AWESOME Happy Hour!  While other restaurants have been cutting quality and quantity, this place isn't.  The food is delicious, and I'm amazed at how they do Mexican food dishes even better than a lot of the Mexican food restaurants around town.  The Happy Hour is soo good!  $5 giant sized appetizers are big enough for a meal and so delicious - especially the calamari, taquitos, and avocado rolls.  The drink specials are pretty great too - wine, beer, mojitos... you gotta love it!  
The service has been good every time I've been there.  The wait staff are friendly, helpful and efficient.
Cheesecake Factory is on the top of my list for places to go and my favorite Happy Hour haunt."}
{"text":"Now let me start by saying I did not order cheesecake on my visit. The desserts looked amazing and probably taste the same, but today's visit was for dinner only. I would add though that I would have ordered dessert if the dang dinner was not priced so high. I have no issue with paying top dollar for a great meal, but this was far from.  My wife and I ordered farfalle with chicken and the four cheese pasta with two meatballs. These two entrees were far from good.  Both, yes both, lacked any flavor. ANY FLAVOR!! The bread provided before the meal had more.  The four cheese pasta with meatballs tasted like it was just pulled from the microwave.  My wife's meal was no different.  To top it off, it was $21 for my pathetic dish and $17 for hers.  What a joke!!!! For a total of nearly $50, we had two sodas and two bad dishes.  After using a $25 gift card (reason for visit), I still feel like I was ripped off."}
{"text":"I am super picky but their spaghetti and meatballs are to die for!!!  So hard to pick things there because their menu is endless!!!! But if you are wanting yummy pasta .. spaghetti is my go too!! Also let me just tell you about their s'mores cheese cake .... HOLY HEAVEN ON EARTH!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice already and I love it. First time I went, I waited for 40 minutes (4 people) and the second time I went (5 people + baby) I waited about 2 and a half hours. When there's a lineup, you receive a buzzer which will buzz if you're not super far away from the restaurant.

When seated, you receive complimentary bread and butter. I've tried the following dishes: deep fried mac and cheese balls, baja fish tacos, truffle honey chicken, four cheese pasta, and an asian style salad. As mentioned, yes the portions are HUGE for one person. If you don't want to pack food home, you could share a dish between two people. I highly recommend the truffle honey chicken!! Chicken was cooked perfectly and was deep fried to perfect. It was placed on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes which was also nicely flavoured. I DON'T recommend the baja tacos - it literally was mostly batter and the size is kind of small. The spiced rice and beans were disgusting. 

And of course, the cheesecake is delicious - the slices aren't extremely big but they are TALL slices. For ~$10 a slice, I'm not sure if I'd say it's worth it since I don't normally eat dessert at a restaurant. However, I would recommend the celebration cheesecake!

Service is great - they talk to you slightly slow with patience since they want to make a good impression. They never want to rush you or feel like you need to eat and get out.

Personally, I wouldn't wait more than an hour if it weren't for my family wanting to try the restaurant. Lucky, we can just shop around.

tl;dr good food (hit or miss), big portions - share a main dish with another and get an appetizer, would not wait more than an hour in line

TIP: 2 people get in faster since more tables accommodates for smaller groups"}
{"text":"I love their Orange Chicken!  We also ordered an order of the Avacado eggs rolls and enjoyed them!  Of course they have a multitude of cheesecake to choose from.  When I'm in a cheesecake mood I go for dark chocolate or the smores."}
{"text":"The cheescake was standard Cheescake factory fare, so it was above average buy below spectacular. The service, however was amazing. Probably better than any other chesscake factory I ahve been too.  courtisy was spilling over by everyone in the place, from the hostess to the server to the busboys. the manager even came over and asked if everything was OK."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!
Except for the hosts, one of the girls were kind of rude not smiling and just made me feel uncomfortable. Overall I would defiantly come back.
Also Amy our server was super nice, very fast, kept our drinks filled asked us questions about our order to make sure it's correct, great friendly girl. If I come back I'm going to ask for her, she was amazing. Great great customer service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I enjoyed our first date at this location 3 long years ago and tonight we celebrated our anniversary here. We love the Cheesecake Factory. I get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my fiancé gets the Shrimp Bistro and they were great tonight as always. This location never disappoints and the staff is always welcoming! Thank you to Lindsey for serving us tonight"}
{"text":"One of the best locations thus far in this part of town ! Came into lunch with my boyfriend , had Kimberly serve us and she was amazing ! The mac and cheese burger is a must try :)."}
{"text":"Went here on Monday 4/30 at 9:00 pm. We realized don't go here when they close at 11:00 pm. Waitress was nice but service was terrible. Just tried to get 4 salads but got two after 20 minute wait. One salad did not come and had to be redone because it was made wrong. Fourth salad never came and tried to get olive oil for bread and that came when we finished the bread. Getting drink refills was real bad and we asked a bus boy once. The Cheesecake Factory in Downtown Denver is so much better maybe they need to learn from them. Will not come back to this one."}
{"text":"I had a gift card as well as coupon for a free slice of Cheesecake as Christmas gifts, so decided to finally use them. The restaurant was fairly busy even in the middle of the afternoon, but I was seated immediately (easy when you are a party of one). The interior was semi-upscale and clean, like most Cheesecake Factory locations.

I originally was greeted by a female waitress who said she would be right with me, but then I ended up being waited on by a young male waiter instead. He was very friendly, but it was clear that he was very new and probably in training. For some reason, he removed my set of utensils and napkins, so I had to ask for a new knife to spread butter when my bread basket came. The bread was fairly tasty: warm and two varieties.

I ended up ordering the eggroll sampler as well as the avocado toast. Both dishes were good, though the avocado spread on the toast was a bit tart. I was actually pretty stuffed after finishing both dishes, so had to take my strawberry cheesecake slice to-go to eat later.

My water was inconsistently refilled, and it took A LONG time for my check to come, and even longer for the bill to come back after I gave my credit card and gift card/coupon. 

Though the service during this meal was a bit below average, the food was still decent and I would consider this a solid Cheescake Factory."}
{"text":"We had such a great time tonight! Our waiter Will was SO great! Our food and dessert was fabulous! The management team was amazing! Thank you guys for making this experience the best one! Valentines day was so busy we couldnt wait for our food, but the fact that you guys went above and beyond to make this day up was definitely a blessing! We did not expect this and we are extremely grateful. We will be coming back soon and you will be reccomended to all our friends and family! Thank you for being a team and taking care of us! And thanks to our waiter Will for being so awesome! Also a shout out to the manager Robert! You were great and we appritiated the sincere apologies and how much you went above and boyond for us! You guys definately know how to run your restaurant as a team and a family. Thanks again! Be back soon :) -Erica and Tony"}
{"text":"Well Im a fan of the cheesecake and the food I usually order has always been quite decent. This restaurant adheres to delivering in plastic boxes much safer than STYROFOAM. At least I ask for that. I will continue to order from them on occasion, as they are a little expensive but better is more money."}
{"text":"Large chain restaurants don't usually get five stars from me, but every time I've gone to this Cheesecake Factory location, everything is perfect, from seating to service to food and, of course, cheesecake.  

The menu is huge, so it takes a while to get through.  However, we fall back on our favorites every other time. I adore the luau salad, full of fresh veggies and crispy candied wonton layers. Family members usually get the meatloaf.  Not only is it good by itself, but the gravy is delicious.  Portions are man-sized. (Okay, maybe not politically correct, but \"person-sized\" doesn't really get the point across.)  

The Asian Chicken Salad is a fav of most of my friends, and I often revert to the three tacos plate.  Another friend like me to go to share the tapas-type of small plates with her.  So, there's something for everyone.

Then there's the free bread.  Both the white French baguette type and the sweet brown bread are yummy, but we always get a second order of just brown bread.  

There's usually no room for cheesecake.  But that's not an excuse not to get some to go!  My choice is either the mango key lime cheesecake or the lemon meringue.  My son's is Godiva chocolate, which has to be eaten over time because it's so rich."}
{"text":"The food was good but not mind-blowing but the portions are rather generous. The prices are a touch on the high side. The service was courteous but somewhat less attentive than we're used to with requests having to be made twice.

We had the meatloaf dinner and a chicken breast plate. The artichoke appetizer tasted like eating bark. The only edible part was the heart making this app simply not worth it. Overall Cheesecake Factory is good but nothing is compelling me to increase my once-every-few-years visit rate."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park last night. 
We have gone there many times before. This is the first terrible experience we had.
After walking in and sliding and almost falling on their greasy floor, we sat exactly 25 minutes after ordering Burgers, and they could not even bring the bread, never mind the entrée. The waiter came over no less than 5 times to tell us he was sorry, but he keeps checking and they keep telling him 'their baking it' We finally got up and left. The manager came over with a feeble attempt to apologize, but with no explanation as to why they could not get bread out of the kitchen for 25 minutes after ordering. Horrible customer service!!!!
I will give this place one more try since as bad as it was , we had nothing but good experiences prior over a very long time period. I mean years.
They need to do something about that greasy floor. Its been complained about a long time by not only myself but others I know. I guess when someone falls and gets badly hurt, they will take care of it."}
{"text":"If I want cheesecake, this is the place to go. The decor is nice and the cheesecakes are super nice. They are open a little later than some restaurants too and the staff is friendly.

The appetizers were decent and so is the food. For the service and the atmosphere, of course you are paying more. But did I mention cheesecake?

Lots of variety of cheesecakes. There's also other desserts as well on the menu. I would have to say this is not the healthiest place to eat since a lot of food is fried and there's an abundance of sugar food available staring at you."}
{"text":"Me and my wife had brunch yesterday I ordered the fried chicken and eggs Benedict and one pancake and my wife ordered the normal two eggs and pancake, to cut this short I got food poisoning and I've been vomiting all day since I got up and know that it's that good that did it mainly cause I didn't eat anything else's I usually eat out of the norm.. stay clear of that place if you don't want to be good poisoned cheers !  I give it one but really it's none !"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is one of my all time favorites.  If I see a CCF at a city I am visiting, I go there.  I had lunch with a friend.  We arrived at 1:56 pm.  We were told that it woudl take 15 minutes - even though half of the restaurant was empty.  It was 2:25 pm and we were still waiting to be seated.  My friend brought this event to the Manager.  He looked at us and said nothing!!  We waited for the waiter longer than usual.  We placed our order.  The salad was supposed to have the dressing on the side.  We waited 20 minutes for the dressing to be brought to our table.  The table was not cleaned before they brought the desert!  I have to say that, in general, CCF service was below standards.  Hope that this is not the new normal for CCF!"}
{"text":"Went here for National cheesecake day and ate WAY too much cheesecake ! They were extremely busy offering half price cheesecake but the wait was short . I had the Godiva chocolate and OMG amazing ! If you're a choco fan this cakes for you . Very nice staff friendly prompt etc . will be going back soon Good job Cheesecake peeps !"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner 7-24-16 started around 4 pm. They were very busy, wait time was short like 5 minutes. Even though they were very busy the restaurant was very clean, nice clean floors. We were seated downstairs, started off with piña coladas, I got the everything pizza and my husband got chicken with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The drinks were delicious and the food was fresh, hot and delicious. Our server was Phillip E. He was very nice, always had our drinks full, just made our experience very enjoyable. We were so pleased we just had to let the manager know what a great experience we had.
Next trip to Las Vegas we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has something for almost everyone, which I suppose is its appeal. It's like a \"fancy\" Applebee's or Chili's, except it doesn't have junk cluttering the walls and the menu options sound appetizing. 

I dined here on a Thursday evening around dinner time. Unsurprisingly, there were plenty of people ahead of us waiting to be seated, because Cheesecake Factory is just too cool to take reservations -- first come, first serve, peasants. 

Once seated, we ordered the avocado egg rolls as a starter. Always a solid appetizer; though the sweet tamarind sauce might be an acquired taste for some. For my entree I ordered the grilled chicken tostada salad. When it arrived, I noticed it was missing the side of vinaigrette dressing, as well as the avocado cream and sour cream. It was unfortunate that our waitress had to make two visits to retrieve the missing items. The salad was quite huge and could easily be shared between two people. Can't say this was one of the best salads that I've ordered from here. To top off dinner, I got the kahlua cocoa chocolate cheesecake, which hit the spot and made up for the salad mishap. 

Off-peak hours are always the best time to visit, if you don't mind waiting. And if you do mind, fortunately there many quality restaurants in the area that you could go to instead."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. 10 years ago, this place used to be good, but now it's like an Applebee's with higher prices. The reason for even 2 stars is because of the service and the cheesecakes are great! I would only come here to eat a cheesecake. Other than that, the food is 1 star. 
Here is my 2 cents. They have like 20 pages of food and it's like reading a damn book, trying to get through the whole menu and trying to figure out what you want. That's like a 10 min ordeal just going through all those pages and by that time, you really worked up an appetite. With such a huge selection, how does the company expect to make good food and perfect a dish? They can't with 100 dishes they have to cook and remember. Id just shoot myself if I was the chef and had to memorize that menu and try to cook it. Condense the menu and make at least one thing right and delicious. 
The pasta I got was bland and said light marinara. It was drenched in Mariana and it was suppose to have a lemon and garlic taste. Didn't taste anything but bland tomato sauce. My bf got chicken and biscuits. The chicken was a joke. It looked like thin floppy slices that you get from a container to.make sandwiches. Im not even sure if it was chicken. McDonald's sells better and bigger chicken breasts. Seriously, the chicken looked so flat, it looked like a flat pancake. Very unappealing and unnatural. It's a shame that this place went downhill."}
{"text":"My partner and I eat here at least 2-3 times a month and absolutely love it every time. We typically start with the crispy crab wontons. They are amazing, filled with crab, green onions and of course, cream cheese. Although they are deep fried, the sweet chili sauce on the side makes them irresistible. Bread service is always great. We usually only ask for the wheat bread with butter, but we were introduced to the white bread with olive oil. AMAZING. The fiancé had a flat bread with dollops of ricotta, and I had a Caesar salad with my favorite carbonara pasta!
Desert was missed because we were so stuffed but our waiter Sean was absolutely amazing. Our drinks were never refilled but his personality was excellent. He remembered everything we told him without having to write it all down in a book like most people do.
That was pretty impressive because we are pretty picky."}
{"text":"Though serving bazillions of unwanted calories, I'm still a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, Chandler. I ALWAYS have good service, good food presentation, and good timing whenever I come here to eat. I've been trying to lose weight so I've been hesitant to eat out, but thank God they have their skinnylicous menu. And it's not just a couple of entrees, it's a full menu from appetizer to full entrees of lesser calories. They have low cal cheesecakes as well. But my all time fave is their Pineapple upside down cheesecake and Linda's Fudge Cake. I have tried numerous entrees here, the Carbonara is a must. The burgers here are huge and flavorful - my fave is the bbq burger, gotta love those onion rings!! Great service, great food, out of this world cheesecakes. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! The menu is overwhelming but I love the variety. 

My favorite drink is the Georgia peach! Although i didn't taste much alcohol in it but it's delicious!

I use to only order the Navajo sandwich which has chicken, avocado, tomato, onions, lettuce in a fry bread. But then I started ordering the MISO SALMON. & Oh my goodness!!! My new favorite dish. Salmon was cooked to perfection, very moist, and was on top of a bead of rice. Surrounding the rice was some kind of creamy white sauce which was amazing and compliments the dish very well, along with chikapeas. I asked the server what sauce it was and she said its some kind of lemon sauce which didn't taste like it at all. Seemed like it has some mayo in it mixed with something else. My mom said it tasted like it had some coconut cream in it. I'll have to ask the server again.

I highly recommend the miso salmon!!

& of course the love the bread and butter :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving it two stars because of poor service. The food is good, but the poor service really ruined my experience. 
My fiancé and I sat at the bar and the bartender took a long time to greet us, then we had to call her back over to order. I ordered my drink, she went and got it, then never even asked my fiancé what he would like. Since she was so rude, I hurried and finished my drink so we could just leave."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, I had the Shepherds pie and my wife had the Cuban sandwich, both were very good and filling. The place was busy even at 8:30 pm when we arrived. The food was very good and the staff was very friendly, the only thing I could find that I didn't like was the poor lighting."}
{"text":"The worst Cheesecake Factory that I have ever been in!! I am a local and not only will I never go there again, I will tell EVERYONE!! When we arrived there this morning approx. 11:30, we promptly placed our breakfast order. FORTY FiVE minutes it's still nowhere in site!! Were they waiting for the chicken to lay the eggs? When we arrived it was NOT busy. We were seated right away and placed our order within five minutes. After forty five minutes we gave up!! We kept asking our server about where our food was. She said the kitchen was backed up!! How? It wasn't even busy when we got there!! We finally told her we're leaving. No manager came to talk to us. Obviously the staff doesn't fall far from the pathetic manager. No one gives a damn."}
{"text":"As always, you can expect the huge menu at the Cheesecake Factory.

And, as always, the food is consistently good. Not great, but good."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Yes you have to wait a while to be seated. But every time we go we put our name on the list and keep an eye out at the bar area since it is first come first serve and end up getting a table there before the buzzer goes off so we turn it in. I have been here so many times for lunch & dinner. Tonight we came for dinner with my husband and step daughter. I always order the same thing barbecue ranch chicken salad is the best!! My husband gets something different all the time and loves everything he gets. My step daughter always gets four cheese pasta and loves it all the time she gets it. Tonight we all shared chocolate moose cheese and it was delish!! 

You have to be very patient when you go there. The waiters guys & gals are awesome for the amount of people they have to take care of. Always so positive and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends on a Friday morning. The first 20 in line receive those beepers to notify that the table is ready. Everyone else lines up! The menu is huuuuge. Seriously, don't underestimate this. What is bothersome is that some of the titles of the food seem to overlap. A lot of the pastas dishes come in a \"lunch size\" option which is really just a smaller portion but they would have their own section in the menu and the regular portions would be listed under different sections. It would have made scanning the menu easier if the food item was described and then have a side note that there are two portion sizes available rather than flipping pages to read the same thing. The Caesar salad a friend ordered was no joke, the size of a pizza pan. I ordered the carbonara and it was okay, I wouldn't abandon it altogether but I've had better and because the menu is so big I would try other dishes first. The cheesecakes are somewhat typical? I ordered the banana cream cheesecake and it was way too sweet for my liking and had more whipping cream than necessary. I've had better cheesecakes from Costco to be quite honest. The service however makes this place a little bit more enjoyable. We were seated at a sort of hub where all the employees would gather and you could tell management was well done! Our server was really sweet as well. 
I would definitely go again with a large group but maybe when the hype dies down a little bit and there are no ridiculous lineups. All I can say is it does come off as a stereotypical \"American\" restaurant; an overly ambitious menu with overly indulgent food BUT the atmosphere is nonetheless fun and relaxed. Realistically I would give it a 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Second time eating here, figured I'd give it two tries before I wrote a review. I have heard about the restaurant very in depth through a class I am taking at UNLV and had to experience it first hand.

For starters the atmosphere of this restaurant is very appealing! A nice calm lighting with a warm and welcoming feeling.

If this is your first time, I recommend ordering an appetizer right away as it will take a good minute to look through the menu. This place has everything you can imagine and it all tastes amazing! 

The food is mouth watering to say the least. The chefs in the back truly know what they are doing and really put their love and passion for cooking into the food. The waiters are also very pleasant and helpful. The prices for this location are very reasonable, especially considering its location along with the quality of the food. 

If you haven't tried this restaurant and are considering it, do it! You will not regret that decision and everyone in your group will find something they like with the endless options in the menu."}
{"text":"I'd say 2.5 stars would be more accurate... It was my first time coming in, and it started off pretty well. But, then service seemed pretty slow. Food arrived, and my bun of my burger was so soaked and soggy that I couldn't pick it up. The friend I came to dine with ordered a \"Chinese CHICKEN salad\". And the salad came out without single piece of chicken. 10 minutes later- Their remedy- bring the chicken out in a bowl. Not make a new salad, not take the salads back and toss it in, just bring out the chicken in a bowl..... Then, we had to request a manage to come speak to us about the whole ordeal, to which he apologizes, and walks away. Doesn't offer to buy a dessert, comp the meal, or do anything to fix the situation. Will not be back. Ever."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory.

I can always count on really good food.

We went on a Friday night and had a fairly large party be were seated within 15 minutes.

We had a wonderful server who was very attentive and kept our drinks filled.

Everyone loved their meal and were definitely full.

You can not go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is an extremely mediocre restaurant that is way too hyped up by Drake fans residing in the GTA. With that being said, the line-up to get in had my friend and I waiting almost 2 hours on a Tuesday afternoon. Nevertheless, we waited in the line to soon be greeted by a waiter that seemingly rehearsed his every word moments before he served our table. Despite the awkward waiter, my friend and I both ordered burgers, and to our disappointment they weren't nearly as tasty as the waiter described. After browsing the extensive list of cheesecakes, we ordered one plain strawberry and one chocolate. You would think a restaurant with the name \"The Cheesecake Factory\" would exceed expectations of any regular cheesecake. The cheesecakes were fine, but tasted like nothing special. Overall, if I'd had known, I wouldn't have waited in the line for a mediocre lunch. Although The Cheesecake Factory met my expectations of a restaurant, they did not, in the very least, exceed them. Honestly, I think Drake sang about his date fighting with him at \"Cheesecake\" because she probably was under impressed that DRAKE would take her to such an over-hyped, and severely average restaurant."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for lunch.  Watched sports on the TV and talked with the bartender to keep entertained.

The factory burger and fries are always a good call.  In fact, the fries are definitely above average.

You'll never leave this place hungry!"}
{"text":"Ah, the Cheesecake Factory. Every time I come here I stick to a rotation of dishes including the jambalaya, the buffalo blasts, and occasionally the salmon and I'm never disappointed. Throw in their delectable selection of cheesecakes and I'm always in heaven. Not to mention the gigantic portions.

Recently CF has added a \"small bites\" menu which is the perfect size if you want to sample a bunch of random tasty treats. I don't think I'd ever purposely come here if given the choice but once in a while it truly hits the spot! Did I mention the cheesecake? Good, can't forget it."}
{"text":"Cheese cake = delicious
Other food = bleh

The Kobe Burger was burnt even though I asked for medium rare. It tasted like cardboard that's been dried in dead leaves. The cheese cake however was delicious, had a Red Velvet but by the time I ate dessert I was already too full from the unsatisfactory burger and fries."}
{"text":"Pretty pathetic experience.  Definitely not happy with my melted glob of what used to approximate cheesecake.  If you're going to make people wait for a half hour for their cheesecake on a call-in order maybe you could leave it in the cooler."}
{"text":"We had Dontae as our waiter tonight. He was very polite and explained everything very well to us. Very good waiter. The food was excellent. He helped me decide on what dessert I should get and his choice was perfect. The place was jam packed. Great atmosphere. Great job Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We have visited this location in the past and the experience has been decent. I believe one experience was 5 star worthy. We visited today for an Easter lunch and it was the worst experience we have ever had at this location. If this was our first impression I wouldn't return.

Our server was Reagan and our entire section was hardly served. Management didn't walk to pick up on the fact that everyone was just sitting either waiting for food or their checks for extended periods of time. She had an unsanitary approach where she would carry our drink or food (other tables food as well) to the cash register or to other tables where she would speak over it. It was really gross. We had to let her know to take the cheesecake to someone else's table and drop it off before taking our dessert order. We had to request that she check on our food due to the amount of time waiting and the food was not warm any longer. 

Overall, we could tell that the tables around us were just as irritated and overheard them speaking about their frustrations as well with the lack of attention she was paying."}
{"text":"We came to the restaurant around 7 and were given a 40 minutes wait time. We came back and were given more time to wait. We got our table and the food was average. Beware of the crowds."}
{"text":"The \"go to\" for my family. Something for everyone and quality is solid every time. Eaten here a dozen or more times and have never been disappointed. Only minor drawback is it is a bit cold at times within the restaurant. If you are temp sensitive bring a light sweater or jacket."}
{"text":"My favorite aspect of the Cheesecake Factory is its dependability and consistency.  The menu is large and incredibly diverse, yet everything I have there is always good to great.  We're not talking gourmet excellence by any stretch, but for the price point I always enjoy myself there.

I'm also a huge fan of their curbside to go system, where you call in your order and they deliver it to your car.  Very convenient and I believe it was the first restaurant to provide the service (at least it was the first that I noticed).

Oh yeah, and the cheesecakes are pretty damn good, too.  You have to love the variety offered."}
{"text":"Excellent! 
The menu is extensive, we had a hard time deciding what we wanted because so much of it looked delicious. 
The kids pizza is huge! We got one kids pizza and our three kids split it with some left over. 
Service was average. 
And, of course, the cheesecake was amazing, we had the Hershey cheesecake."}
{"text":"We arrived for a late lunch started off great but ended terrible. Bread good, southwest egg rolls good and the fried zuchini good. But then it just went down. My wife got a small pizza and it was undercooked and soggy, I got the fish and chips, they were very mushy and oily. My son got the alfredo pasta and he liked it. They comped the pizza that did not have a bite out of it and I got an eye roll about the fish. I guess my major problem is crappy food for $100. This was my first time there and unless my wife pays it will be the last."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY ASK for Crystal.

Superb service and recommendations. Just ask what her favorites Are and you will be in Heaven!!!

I'm now an Addict...Thanks to her :)

She was quick, responsive and funny too.  Vegas best hidden treasure!!"}
{"text":"As much as I hate chain restaurants, Cheesecake Factory is definitely an exception. The menu is longer than the Declaration of Independence, and just as American with choices galore. And the cheesecake? Yea more calories than one should consume per week, but well worth it. Always have good service experiences, but usually on the weekends the line is out the door so they don't care much for taking reservations."}
{"text":"Restaurant open at 11:30, we arrived at11:35, there were plenty of empty seats inside, but we were told we have to wait for about 30mins to get a table! I guess the restaurant enjoys seeing customers waiting outside even the restaurant is empty inside!"}
{"text":"I'm always overwhelmed by their amazing menu. Loved my skinny Licious meal. Good balance to their amazing cheesecakes. Always a treat to visit!!!!!  I just wish the took reservations for dinner."}
{"text":"Went there for Easter dinner after a short wait we were seated. Our waitress was outstanding. My wife's chicken was overcooked and dry. She took it home for lunch. She knows how to salvage things like that. I had the factory grande burrito which was huge and very good. Plenty of avocado and sour cream. She kept the ice teas coming but why three flavors? The bread is always good here. Salads were huge for two others in the party of 5. Waiter recommended the catfish and it came with veggies and was delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of the more reliable restaurants to visit when in LV. Sure, it's kind of tired, seeing as there is one in almost every state, but that's what makes it a must visit since the majority of restaurants on the strip are either a vat of food-poisoning or very overpriced. 

In terms of service this place is almost always busy, so you might not get the service you'd like, and it's also not the best CF I've been to, but it's on my top ten list for LV."}
{"text":"On my visit to CF, the service here stood out... Far beyond the food. In fact, I can't even remember what I ate. The waiter here was originally from Chicago and spoke about saving up to go back. He was incredibly warm and took care of a large order of 8 people with ease. He also kept bringing back their sexy bread, which I so love. 

There are a few CF's in Scottsdale, but I'm sure this is the best one."}
{"text":"The thing about chains is it's generally the service that makes all the difference. I visited this location as well as the 2402 E Camelback Rd location. 

The most notable difference being the amount of people at the other location versus this one. It was startlingly empty for dinner and yet the servers were remarkably busy. 

This visit wasn't memorable."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, I informed the hostess that we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary. I picked out a cheesecake and the hostess said that they would decorate the plate and send it out with a candle at the end of our meal. She said she would pass the message along to the server. I saw her write everything down.

The server was friendly and greeted us in a timely manner. He went over the soup of the day as well as daily specials. We ordered the Eggroll sampler, all the egg rolls were greasy and dripping with oil. The chicken madeira was excellent as usual. And the herb crusted salmon was okay. 

When we were full, the server was kind enough to pack our food for us, but he failed to crumb the table and left our dirty silverware and small plates in the middle of the table. I even moved everything to the middle of the table so it would be easy for him to pick up because I knew he would be bringing our cheesecake out and I wanted to take photos. At the end of lunch, the server handed us dessert menus, I gave him the eye. He said 'I got it'... and brought a cheap birthday sundae with pure whip cream. He put it right in the middle of all the dirty dishes. That really ruined it for me. The Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE RESTAURANT.. or should I say WAS. To be honest, the service 15 years ago was significantly better than the service I've received within these past few years.. especially at the Summerlin location. How can you drop dessert on a table with dirty plates and food crumbs everywhere?? I'd like to add that it was not even busy. And where was the cheesecake I preordered that the hostess said they were going to decorate for our special occasion?

I have over 20 years of restaurant/hospitality experience, so yes! I am a restaurant/service snob! So maybe my service expectations are too high.. but I wouldn't expect anything else from the Cheesecake Factory. I am truly disappointed in my recent experiences with your establishment. A few years ago a  server refilled my water with another water cup saying she couldn't find any water pitchers anywhere... only at the Summerlin location I get this kind of service!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here and mix it up a little since we had a gift card today.  They were pretty busy since it is Labor Day.  

First I tried the Fried calamari that was  light and Crisp served with garlic sauce. Decided to go with glam burger. It was served with french fries and green salad sweet potatoes I wanted to try that Kobe burger which was a American-style Kobe be with sautéed mushrooms and spicy mayo and onions.

The food was great but the service declined as the place got busier."}
{"text":"Illyana is the best!!!! After having an absolute terrible experience a few months back at the Boca park location, this was such a great experience to have!!! She was super attentive, always made sure our drinks were full and she just looks like she enjoys what she does! Thank you illyana!!!!"}
{"text":"I normally would go to the Cheesecake Factory in green valley, where I've never had an issue, but since I was in the area with friends we came to this location. 

I really was blown away by the level of horrible service we received, I barely even know where to start. First it took probably 20-30 minutes for our drinks to come (iced tea!). Even longer for the bread. When ordering, my mother was making sure her meal came with chicken and the waiter, in a disrespectful and condescending tone said, \"of course it comes with chicken, it's in the name.\" When my mother pointed out it does not say chicken in the name he continued to argue with her. I can't even tell you how long it took for our actual meals to come out and when they did my friends order was wrong and mine, being the last one out, finally came when everyone in my party was done eating!! Before my sandwich finally came one of the managers came to sort of apologize and quickly left our table before we could even express our unhappiness. The final straw was when our waiter was clearly trying to be rid of us, moving too quickly to hand us boxes and our boxed up cheesecake, he knocked over my half drunk (overly expensive) drink all over my phone and all down the front of me. He barely apologized for this and rushed off. 

I really never complain let alone post anything like this but the service we received today was totally unacceptable and I will not be returning to this location. If I could I would have given this location zero stars."}
{"text":"So after I received a call from the manager apologizing for the horrible service, he stated he was sending a gift card to have my family back for a meal on the house plus a complimentary dessert.  He sent $30. What??? My bill was $90. How is a family of four supposed to have a meal for $30? Shame on you for wasting my time.  I'd rather go to the Chandler location."}
{"text":"Second time returning to the infamous cheese cake factory. This location is pretty settle, atmosphere and ambience 10/10. Stopped by for the cheesecakes today. Got three huge slices of cake. There are way to many to choose from. Ordered 3 slices for $26. Well worth the price. Dug right into the cakes, super sweet= HAPPINESS. Always a pleasure !!"}
{"text":"Nope, they messed it up. They put some kind of Seasoning on the fish that's not going good with the sauce. It's not bad it's just not the taste I was looking for. I've eaten these at several different Cheesecake Factory. Only one has ever done it right!
My mother says that her food is officially the best she's ever had at the cheesecake factory. She never enjoyed their food until today. 
Good job overall."}
{"text":"Jared was my server great job made my experience great I work in the service industry so I know good service from bad this service was awesome recommended a pasta I loved it thanks for everything keep up the good work"}
{"text":"We stopped in to celebrate my moms birthday. She doesnt get out much so i knew she'd be blown away by CF. We ordered macaroni and cheese balls for appetizer. For dinner, I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo. Bobby ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. My picky mom went to the servers suggestion of Chicken Madiera. I tried everyone's dish and all of it was tasty. 

For dessert, I ordered the simple strawberry cheesecake.. amazing. Kayla was our server and she was a great one. I'm gonna keep this short and sweet ;)"}
{"text":"I dine here periodically after shopping at Caesars. Checked in with the receptionist, waited about 5 minutes before she took us back to a booth. The bred was freshly baked, straight out of the oven.. Still warm. The atmosphere is dimly lit and welcoming. The server was friendly and quick to fill up water. Our order came or fast and tasted fresh. I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad and it was soooo good!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed wonderful Sunday lunch with family. Quick seating and service. Had Steak Medallions they were fantastic. The cheesecake is over the top delicious."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my brothers birthday there, I called when we were on our way and they let me know that it would be a 20 minute wait however once I arrived less than 10 minutes later the hostess let me know that she would let the manager know we were here. The manager came out let us know it would be a 50 minute wait, when I told her we were just told 20 minutes less than 10 minutes ago she stated that the wait time was subject to change. Maybe they should let people know that part... I would understand if there was a lot of people there but there was only 1 other person waiting cause her entire party wasn't there and everyone else walking in was being sat right away. At the end we didn't wait that long but the managers lack of customer service is what gave them 1 star."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory provided some of the best service I've ever gotten at any restaurant. True to any CF, there's a huge menu and even bigger portions. The server was extremely helpful and very nice. Everything was served quickly and loved the atmosphere. Would highly recommend going there again!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd see the day where I don't have to cross the border to visit my favourite restaurant in the whole world. I visited today and I don't have any complaints. The service is spectacular and the food is just as good as I have known it to be in the US. The portion sizes are huge!"}
{"text":"Was treated for my birthday by an awesome group of friends. The food was excellent. Always is for me. The cheesecake of course, was to die for. If I had one \"minus\" it is the lighting. When you have to use your cell phone just to see the menu, and I am by no means visually impaired, well maybe they could consider some type of ambient light. There was nothing. Not even a candle. A small pendant light would have even been good. There still wasn't enough light to read through the menu.  Waitstaff was okay as well. She might have been pretty new though. She did do a good job."}
{"text":"So I went last night with my hubby to the cheesecake factory and I was highly disappointed. I give only 2 stars and that's for the cheesecake, it was the only good thing. 
To start with our server, Shannon D, I think she doesn't like her job. A server myself, we got not enough attention from her and she didn't stop by to ask how aour food was tasting. Cause I sure had a problem with our calamari that were not so good. I have no idea what the kitchen did, that half of them were sticking together in a big clump and they seamed not cleaned the right way, too.
Our server was more concerned how much tips she made from the big party that was right across from us, then taking a little more care on the other guest. My dink was empty for a while and it was sure not that busy, cause the big party already left. By the way, if you iron your shirt and pants, you might look a little more professional, then looking crumbled up from head to toe. It's not really nice to look at, remember your in a service job!
Right as we got the check, is when she asked how our food was, hello, that was a little to late. So we're not going to go back to this location. I would understand if this place was packed, but it was pretty empty."}
{"text":"I like the Cheesecake Factory and am impressed that this one does not have the exorbitant prices that I expected for a hotel restaurant in Caesar's.  The food, service, ambiance and prices were all A-OK.  Thus - 3 stars.."}
{"text":"We usually get seated right away or within 15 minutes. The service is usually very good and we do have our favorite dishes to order: sunday brunch French toast Napolean and the sunrise fiesta burrito."}
{"text":"Almond crusted Salmon salad. I order this all time at various locations and this is the smallest salad ever, barely any dressing and no avocado"}
{"text":"Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane combo
Yummy. Subbed the mash potatoes for asparagus. A minor faux pas- The beef medallions weren't cooked evenly: 2 pieces were medium rare and one medium.  3.5 stars

Lemon raspberry cheesecake my fave. It has lady fingers at the bottom. 4 stars

The service was good and then went into the toilet when the server got another table of diners. 3 stars"}
{"text":"Our wait time was only about 20 min for the place being completely packed. Our server was super helpful and our food came incredibly fast! It was super delicious and reasonable priced."}
{"text":"We are here from out of town and this is our 3rd visit to this restaurant and it is by far our favorite. I wish they had one in Charleston! Service was impeccable and our food was perfect. I definitely recommend the egg roll sampler for an appetizer. My husband was loving it! Our entrees were amazing and his steak cooked perfect. We got our cheese cake to go and ate at our hotel and we enjoyed every bite. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a lot over the years. The food is always good. The service varies but overall it's good. The waiter we've had the last 2 times was slacking off on the job, got an order wrong and we had to flag down other servers for straws and water. Most of the time, our service is terrific.  

Our favorite food includes the wontons, sweet corn tamale cakes, chicken and biscuits, orange chicken, shrimp pasta, shrimp BLT club (off menu), and of course cheesecake."}
{"text":"Went to Cheesecake Factory for my husbands birthday. We've been to CF lots of times, this was out it's time to this one. I love all of the gluten free options. They also have a lot of kids gluten free options which makes eating with a GF kid so much easier. 

Our waiter was great. Our food was also pretty good. I had salmon with a side of pasta instead of potatoes and broccoli. They forgot the side of pasta but quickly corrected that. 

All in all it was a good meal and good experience."}
{"text":"Omg meatloaf and mash potatoes.  They weren't hot, sent back, and the returned plate the plate was hotter than the food.  Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"You're better off driving to Buffalo for the time you'll spend waiting in their 3 lines. First line is waiting in the mall, second line is to get a buzzer and wait to be \"seated\" and third line is once buzzer goes off you line up in another line to wait to be seated. Good luck! Waiting times are not accurate either as I was told wait times increase twice on the same occasion. After that I left and went elsewhere. Their cheesecakes aren't anything special at $9.99 a piece."}
{"text":"Excellent! Be sure to sit in the bar in try the street tacos. Or outside in the later evening timeframe when it's not too hot,_"}
{"text":"We went for lunch. The appetizer was fantastic, but it rapidly went down from there. I had a turkey sandwich and I swear the bread was contractor grade. I mean seriously, if I were building a new house this stuff could be used to construct the foundation. I mentioned it to the waiter 3 (!!!) times and he still didn't offer anything to fix it. I finally had to say \"Hey, can't you do anything about this?\" His \"manager\" comp'd me a slice of cheesecake, whoop-dee-doo. The tab was over $100 for myself, wife, and our three kids. That free slice of cheesecake sure helped! Bottom line is, we will NOT be going back even if it's free!"}
{"text":"Great food and surprisingly awesome service too. I'd say it is as over hyped as everyone says it is, but it was worth the visit today. My friends and I got a spot fairly quickly (about 10 mins. during the lunch hour) since we decided to sit at the bar. We had the avocado egg rolls, crab and artichoke dip, and the lettuce wraps. They all arrived promptly and were very tasty. The lettuce wraps in particular are delicious and great for sharing. I ordered a fresh strawberry cheesecake to take home (the 6\" round is $34). That cheesecake was worth the hype. It really was the best cheesecake I've ever had. It's the one thing I'll likely be back for."}
{"text":"After a long wait, this place and the staff amazed us. Im going to keep this short and sweet because the wait to get in was long enough. The food is expensive but huge portions. The drinks are fantastic my fav - pineapple moscow mule and honey bourbon (I forget the name). Get the cheesecake to go and enjoy it at home with a cup of tea, the smores one is amazing!

I'd like to give a huge shoutout to the staff which is why this place is getting 5 stars. Outside of the restaurant, through all of the complaints and remarks from people waiting in line they never once broke down and had a ton of patience and showed great customer service. Inside, even better they went the extra mile to pull us out of the wrong line we were in and put us in the right line a young gentlemen with dark hair. Our servers were excellent, I really wish I had gotten their names. One was a sweet younger lady who later had another gentlemen with an accent help us out halfway during the evening. Everyone was so nice. 

My recommendation, if you're going to spend that long in line make sure you come with a big wallet because you should really try out multiple drinks and food to get the whole experience.

I probably will come back here again, in a couple year or so when the line dies down. I told myself I would never be one of those people to wait in that line, but I did and 3 hours later I had a great experience with my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Only good thing about my experience at this cheesecake factory is the stuffed mushrooms. Other than that I didnt like the waitress because she was a complete (b$%Ch). She received like 50 cents for tip. YES, even thats pushing it because I dont feel like she deserves a dime. Anyways, the corn fritters werent good and neither was the mojito that I ordered. You would think if you pay so much for a drink it would be good, but it tastes just like concentrated lemonade with a hint of alcohol. *GROSS. the end"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an ice cold Blue Moon and dinner! We had the small plates, enjoying Asian lettuce tacos and Spring Rolls. They were delicious! We followed with coffee and banana cream cheesecake... hard to choose, but this one was in my top 3 at Cheesecake Factory!!"}
{"text":"New to this location but The Cheesecake Factory is one of my fav's.  Large menu, unique decor is always a nice change of pace.  Miso salmon, club & Tex next egg rolls are the best."}
{"text":"The family went to this restaurant on Monday, February 23rd.

If I was just rating this restaurant on food, I would give them a 5 star, but upon sitting down I noticed that my spoon had dried food on it and the divider between the seat cushions had a load of food debris.

That said, I want to say it didn't have an impact on the food or the service.  Antonio was our server and he was excellent.  We started out with an appetizer of lettuce wraps, these with chicken and quite tasty.  The main course followed soon, my wife ordered a Mushroom Burger, mmmm delicious.  My daughter ordered the 4 Cheese Pasta and she loved it.  And finally I ordered a Macaroni and Cheese Burger, enticed by the idea of macaroni and cheese on a hamburger.  The macaroni was a ball, breaded and deep fried on top of the hamburger which was charbroiled and served with all the extras including fries.  What a surprise, this was a very good combination, especially if you like macaroni and cheese anyway.

The restaurant was very busy but that didn't affect service.  Antonio took great care of us and our drinks never got empty.  The downside here is that they do not have Raspberry Iced Tea, my favorite, but only had regular and a couple of bottled teas.  I settled for regular tea but didn't enjoy it or finish it.

And what would  a trip to the Cheesecake Factory be without some cheesecake?  While mom and I were stuffed from the burgers, our daughter had no trouble ordering a piece of Hershey Bar Cheesecake to go.

Overall, this was a very pleasant lunch and we will be sure to return."}
{"text":"The Mojoto was great.. The service was okish .. but clean and not that busy around a sunday night for a party of 3."}
{"text":"I never eat at this restaurant as I prefer small local places. I attended a birthday celebration recently. the menu is TOO much, too big, too many choices. Portions are huge, who can eat all that food, no wonder Americans are so fat. The food was Okay. I liked the barbecue chicken salad, however, if you can't make a good salad, then there are problems. 

The problem was the server. She to came to the table four times to take the same drink order and was totally unaware she had been there many times before. It was obvious she was impaired in some manner. The evening was saved by the  manager whose name I did not get. He took over, got our drinks and then assigned us a new server."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations for my birthday. Service was great and quick. Everything we tried from the appetizers all the way to the desserts were delicious. We recently moved out here from Texas so we're not familiar with the area and absolutely will be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar. Empty glasses ignored. Never asked if food was ok. Watched the bartender text on his phone. Other bartender Steve had the personality of a lint ball. We were one of two parties at the bar, really?. Fail. In this economy both of these fools should be fired."}
{"text":"It's been quite some time since I've eaten a meal at a Cheesecake Factory. I was taken out to dinner here to enjoy my first \"real\" meal after being on a very strict protein-and-pretty-much-nothing-else diet for the past two months.

I didn't know what to order and ended up getting spaghetti and meat sauce. I wasn't really a fan. It was too sour and there wasn't any \"oomph\" with the flavor in the sauce or meat.

As for my date's dish, he got grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Definitely looked a lot more appetizing than my spaghetti. He let me try some of the salmon and mashed potatoes. Salmon was okay. Those mashed potatoes though. Oh My God. I died. My taste buds were in heaven. The butter and the texture. The underlying kick of horseradish. I could have just eaten the mashed potatoes as my dinner. He even asked if I wanted a side of mashed potatoes to go since I was so clearly enjoying myself. I should have said yes.... hah!

As for dessert, I thought about getting cheesecake, but I really wanted ice cream. I hear my date say  \"oh my god\" right before I'm greeted by a freaking goblet of chocolate ice cream with whipped cream and almonds and hot fudge. I did my happy dance while enjoying that.

I do wonder if those mashed potatoes would taste different if I wasn't just coming off of a really restricted diet though. But it doesn't matter - that was a dinner date I probably won't ever forget. Haha!"}
{"text":"No complaints here.  My family usually come here if we can't decide what new place to go or if we just want to stay close to home.  The warm wheat bread they serve with butter is delicious,  try not to eat too much before your entree! I enjoy pretty much every dish here from the pasta dishes, burgers, sandwiches, desserts and so on.  This place is a must.  One thing i am bummed about, they took their ahi tempura rolls off the appetizer menu.  I was told they change their menu every 6 months.  :("}
{"text":"The most terrible cheesecake factory ever.  We deicded that after a long day on the strip we would end the night by going to the cheesecake factory. We were a group of 8 people with one person on a scooter becuase they had a broken foot. We walked up and they took down our name and the wait wasnt to bad. At most we waited about 5 minutes, which in our eyes is very duable. Here is where it goes down south.

Once we were seated no one ever came to us to greet us or take out order. We sat there annoyed, hungry, and sleepy for about 15 minutes before someone even came. Then when he did come, he took our drink orders and some appitizer orders and took about another 10 minutes to come back with our drinks. Mind you 6 out of 8 people ordered water the other two coke. You can not tell me that it takes 10 minutes to get some water from the tap!

When the waiter finally did return with our drinks he took our order. At this point half the group took their meal togo because we were tired of sitting there playing the waiting game. It took us about 45 minutes to get our food. Which took entirely to long. We saw families sit down after us by like 30 minutes and get their food before us. While we waited, we never got any bread like the rest of the tables. We asked for some, but never reccieved any. Along with that, we had one person ask about the oil they use because of food allergys. The waiter said that he would check and get back to us and he never did. So one person in our group didnt even order anything becuase he failed to get back to us with important health related information. 

Once the food did come, we were ready to go. Some meals ended up being nice and hot while others cold and undercooked. My sister ordered shrimp alfredo and her shrimp were were raw and cold. She ate one shrimp because it looked off and no long be hold it was raw and cold. She immedietly sent her plate back, when she did the waiter caught a bad attitude with her with was not neccessary at all. We waited for our checks, paid and then left.  We were sitting there for roughly 2.5 hours for us not to even eat our food at the resturant. This is the most unprofessional resturant that I have been to, along with that having rude and unknowledgeable staff.  I DO NOT RECCOMEND this to anyone. While some had a good experiance, we did not. If you want to go out to eat, go somewhere else, but this is not the place togo. 

I included a picture of two of the meals before they were boxed up and taken home."}
{"text":"Great customer service but avoid the steaks!

Went in tonight (party of five, two kids), service was great!  They brought out the kids meals first, no problem; then came two of the entrées, mine was still not brought out.  I ordered the Hibachi Steak (medium rare), it came out about 4 minutes after the other entrées.  The quality of the steak was aweful, very veiny with fat; also under cooked.   I buy better meat at Costco all day long.  I sent the steak back the next time the manager brought it out, same problem, it was just warmer.  The manager said that it was cooked to the internal temperature specifications to qualify it to be medium rare.  The server took one look at it, and agreed with me that it was still undercooked. They offered to redo it, or make me something else, I declined; I don't want to be the guy who sends food back just for a comped meal.  I'll go back, eventually; but I'll never order a steak there again."}
{"text":"Today was such a great visit!  I immediately got a table for my party of 3 and our waiter was attentive but not intrusive.  We had some menu questions answered respectfully and accurately.  We had 4 appetizers and 2 sandwiches, all prepared with our requested modifications.  I have a new attitude toward them and admit my first visit at this location might have been too soon after they opened."}
{"text":"As always, I have never been disappointed at The Cheesecake Factory. I will go there every chance I get and even living in Las Vegas has not dampened my liking for that extensive menu. We only had appetizers and split an entree, and yet it was still a great experience as we sat on the terrace and enjoyed the beautiful weather."}
{"text":"I can't believe when  I was younger I actually thought the Cheesecake Factory was considered fine-dining. Thankfully my tastes have evolved over the years. They still have decent dishes, as far as national chain restaurants go. But, quality is something I don't associate with this place anymore. Since when is tuna gray? That was the case with the tuna tartare that arrived at my table. It was mainly a stack of avocado with a few chunks of gray tuna on top. Other dishes that I've had recently have been ok -- the  avocado eggrolls were perfectly crispy and not too oily and the chicken samosas were decent. Then, of course there's the cheesecake. It's the main reason why I liked this place growing up. On our last visit we tried the tiramisu cheesecake and the chocolate mouse cheesecake. Neither had the rich, creamy, indulgent taste that I remember. Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory just doesn't live up to the expectations I once built up. Although I'm not totally ruling out a return visit when my cheesecake craving returns."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an extensive menu with wings, wraps, calamari, several salads, pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, some fish, tacos and enchiladas, of course cheesecake, etc. The restaurant was very overpriced for the quality of the food, and the service was very slow. I will never go to a Cheesecake Factory ever again."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I never have a bad meal and the service is excellent. This location is located in the Boca Park shopping center. For customers they offer free valet parking. If you don't feel like valet, they have a private lot for parking or there is a parking garage.

I love to start with the \"Avocado Eggrolls\" and if you have never tried them you must! They were priced at $10.50 and can easily be shared.  My favorite thing to order for my meal is the \"Carlton Salad\". It is huge but I manage to polish off every last bite because the awesome flavor keeps my fork going back for more. The salad was priced at $13.95 which is fair for the size and amount of fresh fruits & veggies in it.

The only problem is I never have room for one of their many choices of fabulous cheesecake for dessert so I pick one to-go. This last visit it was a hard choice but they are all so good I new I couldn't go wrong with the \"Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake\".  If you don't feel like eating inside or outside on the patio, you can phone in your order for pick up. They say to wait in your car and they will bring out your order but if I phone in a order I usually just go inside and pick it up because they are always so doggone busy.  I noticed on the menu they offer catering."}
{"text":"We have brunch at Cheesecake Factory every Sunday after Church unless we are out of town.   So while staying at Caesars Palace for a few days we tried not to eat at Cheesecake Factory but ended up going there twice.   Unlike Starbucks their menu prices were the same as home and the food was great, especially after  spending lots of money elsewhere and you were not too satisfied.

We love their warm wheat bread.  Service is always great.   Some of our favorite food here are Asian lettuce taco, fish and chips, grilled steak medallions, lemon ricotta pancakes, and fried zucchini sticks."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service. Everything was cooked perfectly and our service was superior!!! Good job Cheesecake Factory 5 plus in my book"}
{"text":"Amazing pasta and bread! The meals are so large you can split them between two people. The diversity of food options is amazing. Great atmosphere and waiters as well as decor. It is a very upscale looking restaurant."}
{"text":"We (wife and I) come here a few times a year.  We typically enjoy the food and are shell-shocked by the drink prices.  

The good:
+The menu is ginormous.  There's something for everyone.  We almost always get the spicy ahi tempura roll.  Love it.
+The food is good.  It's not great, but it's good.  
+The atmosphere.  It's nicely decorated...fancy feeling.

The bad:
-It's very popular.  LOTS of people here at all hours.  It is not surprising to have wait times 1-2 hours on any day of the week at any hour of the evening.
-The drinks cost a small fortune.  My wife and I waited two hours for a table one night and thought...\"why don't we just have a couple drinks while we wait?\"  We did.  We paid our bar tab and then bought dinner and wine.  When we paid for the meal it cost less than the bar bill had for two drinks each.

Best way to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory is go an hour or so before you really want to eat and get on the waiting list.  Take a buzzer with you into the mall, shop for a while and then check back.  Otherwise, the wait is too long.  Plan ahead, and it's a nice evening meal."}
{"text":"Theyre usually busy but really try to get everyone taken care of in a timely fashion. ordering over the phone can be a bit of a pain if theyre busy but its understandable. food is great i love the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer and a huge fan of their red velvet cheesecake"}
{"text":"Jonathen was our bartender. He was awesome! Quick service, good drinks, and an overall very nice personality. Plus he's a hottie! He did pressure me into getting adams peanut butter cheesecake, which was an overall great choice... Lol"}
{"text":"We got a Gift Card from and friend and decided to make it a date night.
Went on a Friday night at 6:30 and they seated us right away (huge points for that one)
We both wanted some cheesecake so we just ordered a few appetizers to we wouldn't be too full to eat them which usually happens at this place. Our waitress was quick and very nice!"}
{"text":"Got in with 40 min wait! Mind you, it was NYD, mall was closed and only 2 ppl. I always liked CF and go whenever I cross the border. Cnd loc is every bit as consistent to U.S.. Fried mac n cheese is rich but tasty,  dynamite shrimp was light and crunchy. Tried pork chop and wasn't disappointed. Thick but juicy and well balanced, nice salty sweet combination with apple sauce. Portions are big, did not need all that mash potato. For dessert, we had salted caramel cheesecake, very decadent. Simpler the better, but not too simple, white chocolate raspberry is best so far. Honestly, I go for the main meal and not for the cheesecake. CF is not cheap but worth the try. Not worth 3 hr wait unless you have serious shopping to do."}
{"text":"ISO I ate at the Cheesecake Factory last Tuesday and had the chicken nachos appetizer for the next few days I thought I had diarrhea but after going to the doctor they let me know that I actually contracted food poisoning from that place. I unbelievably disappointed and hope that you all do better to your other customers"}
{"text":"Me and my best friend go here all the time, awesome ambiance usually wherever we sit, always pretty decent service, and the food we love! We love the appetizers: Endive Salad, blue cheese & arugula Flat bread, Margarita Flatbread. For drinks I've had/love the Chocolate Martini, and Moscato! And the strawberry shortcake dessert is delish

Never underestimate your local chain restaurant in Scottsdale(;"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to the Cheesecake Factory intending on eating lunch at 3pm but we had to wait 3 hours for a table and ended up eating dinner instead at 6pm. 

I ordered the fish tacos and for dessert their classic strawberry cheesecake. The food was delicious and it was a good portion size, but really expensive!! Usually ordering some tacos at any other restaurant wouldn't be more than $15 -- but at the Cheesecake Factory basically every menu item is $20+. Plus the one slice of cheesecake I had for dessert was an extra $10 (ouch). In the end I ended up spending roughly $35 for dinner with tax and tips.

The food was definitely good, but not worth the price or the 3 hour wait. I know everyone wants to experience the cheesecake factory for themselves, regardless of the wait times and prices -- so my advice would be to bring a laptop or predownload some shows ahead of time on your phone. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Ok went Saturday at lunch time not to busy . We were seated quickly. That's when it all went wrong. The waitress was to busy talking to get our drink orders we waited about 8 minutes for her to quit talking to another employee to come over. We did get our drinks waited another 10 minutes  for her to come back and get our order. Everyone around us was given bread we had to ask twice before she remembered to bring it. Someone else brought out the food . It was good. But never got a refill or did she check to see of we needed anything else . Then when we she brought the check we ask about dessert she said u want it Togo . We said no then she was like oh ok . Then she dropped food on the floor and just kicked it out of the was hoping someone else would pick it up. Spook with manager on the way out he apologized."}
{"text":"I had the pepperoni pizza and small salad lunch combo. My wife had enchiladas. We had lemonade that was pretty strong. We both enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"I used to really dislike Cheesecake Factory, mostly because it's a chain business and there's a lack of personality. The portion sizes are also ridiculously large and food too unhealthy. I avoided this place for years until the last year when someone really wanted to go here, and I forced myself to go. When I showed up, I was pleasantly surprised by their Skinnylicious menu which has options 590 calories or less. It's a sizable and diverse menu. That immediately won me over. Of course the other large portions/unhealthy options are still there, but I can appreciate the increased sensitivity to a nutrition-conscious customer. Flash forward another few months, Cheesecake Factory started including calorie information on their menu. Another added bonus. I know nutrition in America is heading in this direction but nevertheless, I am still impressed.

They offer bread as an appetizer that always arrives at the table warm! Menu options are bountiful and food types vary greatly. Everything usually tastes good. Their cheesecake is AMAZING! But, it's extremely sugary and fatty so beware.

Specifically for this location, they always seem to have good customer service, one of their redeeming factors. Their wait staff is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and professional. They're always quick no matter how busy they are. The hostesses are always nice, despite the chaos of large crowds. There is usually a wait varying from 5-90 minutes during busy hours. I went there today and the wait was maybe 5 minutes. When my name was called, I started walking up but saw someone else walk up to the hostess desk and claim herself as Sylvia. This other person may have heard wrong and something completely innocent happened, but when I finally made my way there and told them I was Sylvia, they apologized profusely for what had happened and seated me immediately. It wasn't their fault this happened, but I still appreciated the way the handled it."}
{"text":"Like every other Cheesecake Factory they were organized and friendly. What I liked the most about the place was I that it had a lot of natural light, large windows and tall ceilings. It was a perfect place for a weekend breakfast. They strawberry milkshake is the best!"}
{"text":"Sad but true that you would not serve us on the patio.  Indoor was not an option since we had our dog with us.  It was not raining and in fact sun is out at 12:40 on Saturday.  There appeared to be maybe 20 customer tables tops and many staff members just standing around.  Disappointed to make the trip and be turned away."}
{"text":"The cheesecake almost convinced me to go 3 stars, but it just wasn't enough. 

The service has been hit or miss, but is more often than not ok. The food on the other hand, has been a letdown every time I've gone. Nothing so terrible that I've had to send it back, but nothing that I would want to get again. And with the price they're charging that's unacceptable. 

Carryout cheesecake is my only recommendation here."}
{"text":"Great lunch. The dishes was much over my expectations. I had the Bellagio chicken pasta which tasted great and my wife had the anti-oxidant salad which was not too bad. Cheesecakes here are all well made and we chose the original one which tasted slightly too cheesy to my taste."}
{"text":"I almost wish I could give this experience negative stars. We eat the Cheesecake Factory often and this was by far the worst experience. We generally order out because we have had some interesting experiences dinning in. As always, he gets the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and I got Chicken and Biscuits. So my chicken was not all the way done and my biscuits were hard as rocks! My fork wouldn't even go through them. To top it all off, the meals were cold! Not cool not lukewarm but cold. When we got there, they were just bringing our food out so there was no reason for it to be cold. We also ordered the Firecracker Salmon Rolls and they were mushy. One of the sauces was poured in the bottom of the container while the other was in a little to go cup as it should have been. Both sauces should have been in cups. Well we had mushy salmon rolls which also were cold. It was as if they had the meals sitting inherited back for over and hour. It only takes us 10-15 minutes to get there. The fact that it wasn't even sitting in the bakery when we picked it up meant that it should have been hot! Needless to say it will be a while if ever we decide to revisit this location. It was a disappointing experience. I never expected that I would get such bad food from a nice place like this."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with my husband.  I had the filet and garlic mashed potatoes.  Food was great and drinks were also tasty.  Mojito!  However, for a chain restaurant, I find the prices to be a big obnoxious.  Cocktails were $10 each!  Even with a $50 gift card we still spent an additional $115 for dinner and drinks for the two of us. AND THE WAIT WAS OVER TWO HOURS! No call ahead seating or reservations."}
{"text":"Never had a problem with cheesecake factory they all been consistent in the same let me tell you they have many different styles of cheesecake and always are very good my favorite dish on the menu is a salmon moist sweet and flaky if you're ever around a cheesecake factory stop by and get yourself a bite to eat if you're not hungry just grab a cheesecake"}
{"text":"I was craving cheesecake and well a trip to the strip happened!  We got there around nine  pm on a Thursday's night not too busy, and there was no wait time. However in case you come in a busy day there is always the aquarium and the show that happened to be conveniently located by the front of the restaurant to keep you entertain. 
My boyfriend order a Long Island ice tea and I got a mojito. The mojito a was delicious ! We got the macaroni and cheese appetizer and since we were there for dessert the tiramisu cheese was our goal. The service was amazing and the atmosphere was relax since it was almost closing time."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 8 for my friend birthday! The wait wasn't horrible for Friday (about 45min) but I have to say that the server nick was absolutely Amazing! He attended to our entire party well (refill in timely manner, always asked if we needed anything else CONSTANTLY) this guy is awesome! Great job Cheesecake Factory :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at this location today (a Saturday afternoon).  There was a short wait of about 10-15 minutes.  We were seated in the bar area.  It took our waitress a little while to come to our table, but I hate being rushed so I didn't mind.  Our server was very nice and courteous, and definitely the highlight of the meal.  

My menu pages were greasy inside, like someone had butter on their hands and then touched the menu.  Gross.  Note to hostess desk - clean your menus!

For an appetizer, the fried calamari was good, but a little too greasy.  For an entree, I ordered fish tacos, tortillas were very greasy and I had to send the dish back.  The second time they forgot to hold the cream, so I had to send my dish back again.  Coming from Los Angeles, I eat fish tacos all the time but these were just very bland.  I make them better at home.  I've had these before at another location and they were great, which is why I chose to order them.  By the time I finally got my food, I was already full from the appetizer and bread, so I just took them home.  If I knew I was taking a dish to go, fish tacos would be my last choice, since tortillas are obviously going to get soggy.

My husband had to send his fettucine alfredo back because the pasta was all clumped together.  It's like they overcooked it, then left it sitting without the sauce so it all stuck together.  For $19 for pasta and chicken, that's just ridiculous.  The kitchen staff needs to raise their standards for the prices they charge.    

I've never had a problem at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but this one was definitely sub-par, with the exception of our waitress.  She was terrific.  Overall, an experience I wouldn't want to repeat.  I'll probably stay away from Cheesecake Factory for awhile.  Waste of money."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Try the chicken Madeira with onion rings and a salad with their awesome blue cheese dressing."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day, driving 2 1/2 hours from home and arrived @ 1:30 pm and had to wait in a line out the door just to get my name on the list. They said come back in an hour to get a pager. Came back after shopping in the attached mall and waited in the line out the door again to get my pager, and waited about an hour more before finally getting a table for 2. I don't think I have ever seen a restaurant so busy but they handled it well. Food and service were good. The cheesecake was really good.Ordered some to take home also."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my family. I've never had issues with this restaurant before and again I didn't. The food is never too die for but you get big portions and the staff is usually very friendly and attentive. 
The 5 of us split two apps.. Chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls. Both pretty tasty and it was a good amount to share between us and leave room for dinner. 
We all liked our meals too, my aunt was disappointed in the white chicken chili bc they said it wasn't spicy and it was and they also said it came with a side of rice. Well the rice was about a tablespoon on her soup. So that was far from truthful. 
Normally I like to try places that aren't chain restaurants, so when I read the menu here, which is almost TOO big, I sometimes get disappointed because it's almost like they try too hard to make different dishes. Hard to explain but I'm sure a lot of you feel the same. 
Once again, I didn't leave room for dessert. I do however recommend their red velvet cheesecake from the last time I was there. 
I also recommend the Cajun chicken littles and Cajun pasta with chicken asparagus peas and peppers."}
{"text":"I always get the miso salmon. Its truely heavenly.

The chicken madeira is great too. 

And you can't go wrong with dessert."}
{"text":"The food here is okay but I can't help think that this place is a master of none.  The draft beer is standard fare.  The service is okay.  The menu is large but the advertising just looks tacky to me.

I ordered the gumbo which seemed to be more like jambalaya.  They don't even give you a spoon to eat it.   

They have added a skinny menu which is nice to see and the women in my party liked the items.  Obviously they are moving away from the large portion thing.  

The cheesecake, as always, is great with a large selection to choose from.  I just wished the server would stop bashing the smores choice.  We liked it."}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant. Why, I don't know. Food is barely ok for the prices. The filling inside the potstickers was dry and tasteless. The chicken and shrimp gumbo was nothing to write home about. Nice place to take a date to impress but that's about it. Would not go again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! i came here on a Saturday afternoon with my family to celebrate my dad's birthday and I have to say after coming to this location on several other occasions I'm not sure I would come back after this visit. The food was the typical Cheesecake Factory experience. I ordered from the skinnylicious menu and the sausage flatbread was good. The other 11 people in my party also seemed satisfied with the food.

Now for the service this is where I had to give a lower rating. Obviously with a larger party there will be some challenges but I honestly have never had a problem like this before. Our server started out with the worst attitude when he came over to our table because we immediately wanted to order our drinks but he insisted on introducing himself first and denying our orders until this happened. Then he got into an argument with my sister about the fact that he wasn't able to do his job because we knew what we wanted right away, isn't that a servers dream?

The rest of the service continued with a passive aggressive tone from our server and then a second loud argument with my aunt over his behavior. She ended up not ordering anything and the whole experience honestly ruined my dads birthday celebration. About half-way through the evening, the manager finally came over to talk to us and from that point on we didn't have any problems. However the special night was already ruined so it didnt really matter. 

I also told our server about the birthday celebration so they could bring my dad a treat but we never got it and I honestly didn't feel like asking again after the night we had.

I am not a fan of this restaurant in general and I certainly won't be back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday around 4pm. They were fairly quick on having us seated. The waiters were attentive, kind, and patient. The menu has something for everyone. The cheesecakes are a nice treat. I personally love the banana cheesecake and the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. The only con I have is they only offer reservations \"sometimes\". It depends on the day and time."}
{"text":"I came here last Wed. to get a 50% off slice of cheesecake, since they were running a promo for Nat'l Cheesecake Day.  I opted for takeout since I wanted to sit by the river to eat my cheesecake, and things were a bit hectic due to the promo.  I decided to try the new lemon meringue cheesecake, since I was in the mood for something on the lighter side.  Due to the crowd, it took about 5 min. for the cheesecake to come up, during which time I used the restroom (to the left of the take out counter).  Though I've never dined in in this location, the dining space was quite cavernous.

When my cheesecake came up, it was served to me in a bag.  I asked the woman serving me if a fork and napkins were had been included, and she said they were.  Despite this, when I sat down and removed the contents, no napkins were in the bag.  (This wasn't a huge deal, however, since I'm not a big napkin user--on the other hand, missing the fork would have necessitated having to go back.)  When I opened the box containing the cheesecake, it was slightly squished on one side due to how it had been loaded into the bag, and some of the meringue stuck to the side of the box.  Speaking of which, the meringue application wasn't nearly as polished as it looks in the official photo, and for a cheesecake inspired by lemon meringue pie, I was expecting it to have quite a bit more volume--as it were, it was a thin, flimsy foam.  The filling, on the other hand, was quite creamy and delicious, with lots of lemony flavor.  I appreciated the garnishes of candied lemon peel on the whipped cream that comes with the cheesecake and of mint leaves, which I ate and chewed on, respectively.  Overall, despite that its visual appeal left something to be desired, I enjoyed this piece of cheesecake, esp. for $4.25, and would recommend it.  In fact, I'd be willing to award 4 stars, but for the appearance of the slice and the lack of sufficient meringue.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Normally the service is at least four stars but being the afternoon of New Years Eve maybe they were short of cooks. Our order was taken quickly. She asked if we wanted bread and we said no. She came back with bread and said they only had wheat. Good thing because it was almost an hour later before we got our food. I ordered a small Caesar salad with no croutons...but it came with croutons. She offered to take it back but I didn't want to wait any longer. Quicker to just pick them out. We ordered lettuce chicken tacos and edamame. We were wondering why these items took so long to be served. We ended up asking for our cheesecakes to go to save time. Nothing wrong with our food but was kind of full because of munching on bread while waiting a long time. Carrot and low carb Cheesecake were delicious as expected."}
{"text":"I usually like this place, but today was very disappointing. I give 2 stars because our waiter was very nice. My husband's chicken picatta was bland. He did like his onion soup. I ordered shrimp with angel hair pasta. I thought that is what I ordered. I showed the waiter on a particular page. I showed him shrimp with angel hair pasta but when I was served my lunch, it looked odd. It was soggy breaded shrimp on the side in little sauce, burnt sauce pieces and whole garlic cloves and a Luke warm ball of the pasta. The shrimp coating was pasty/soggy and had a weird flavor. I flagged the waiter and we reviewed the ordering/food quality situation. We decided I ordered the Scampi which has the breaded shrimp and whole garlic cloves. Whatever. He brought me 6 nicely sauteed shrimp which was brought after I ate the slightly warm ball of pasta. I didn't want to complain too much as to not further make my husband uncomfortable. It is hard enough that he needs gluten free so I was clear and took blame for the wording of my order though what I was pointing to and reading from the menu was not the item I was served. Even though I told our waiter the pasta was not hot, he did not offer to fix that.
They were also out of soup spoons and offered my husband a tea spoon or a pasta (large spoon). Very weird. That happened when I had soup there 3 months ago. The ladies restroom was dirty and trash can over flowing with trash on the sink and floor. I let them know the ladies room needed attention as I was leaving. The waiter was very nice and 80% attentive. It was an expensive lunch. Not sure if we will go back. I am a former restaurant professional instructor and shopper. I try and not be too critical."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as always. As far as the staff goes I was very disappointed. My son ordered lunch sand soup and salad. We asked what the soup of the day was and we were told it was potato. Well I wanted to try it and turns out it was clam chowder. I am allergic to seafood fish ECT. We informed our server of the situation . A manger never stopped by so either he said nothing or manger didn't care enough to stop by. My mouth was swelling and burning also had blisters in my mouth. We had to pack everything and leave in hurry. 
Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite places eat"}
{"text":"Alright, so I ever so slightly want to amend the rating that I had previously given..........now 3 stars. 
I dined there last night and topped my meal off with the Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake, and WTF!!! (sigh) That was AMAZING and I thought that I hated cheesecake?!?!??!?! Apparently as long as that flavor exists, I'll be a fan! 
;)"}
{"text":"Terrible service time in takeout. Takes 45 mins for them to put a cake in a box with minimal icing added. Would not recommend getting a cake from here. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"We just ordered to go.  It was easy and fast, service was great.  I asked for a to go menu, the guy gave me the restaurant menu.    I ordered the garden salad and pizza.  Hubby loves there meatloaf.  So when we got it home, my pizza wasn't even a little warm, it was cold.  We don't live that far from this place for that pizza to be that cold, so that was a disapointment.  The salad just had tomatoes in it.  So I had to come home and doctor it up.   Yeaaaa, I wouldn't ever order this again"}
{"text":"This is regarding the chocolate mousse cheesecake my friend picked up yesterday for a party, not the restaurant because how could you not love that place. I was VERY disappointed in the crust on the cheesecake. Like aren't you the Cheesecake Factory? You had one job! Instead of tasting like a Oreo cookie crust or what you would expect on a chocolate cheesecake the crust literally tasted like hard dry chocolate cake. I eat cheesecake for the crust. I was sad. Don't try it."}
{"text":"Good selection. Family friendly. You can valet or park on the north lot of the outlets level 2 otherwise you're in for a walk in this maze of stores. Kids menu had lots to choose from."}
{"text":"You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory.  They're all the same as far as food, service, and layout.  Normally I give the chain a 4 based on food quality and good service, but this location is far more challenging to get into than others during busy times.  I gave it a three based on that.  Not their fault I guess, but we've wasted a lot of time waiting around for a table or even for to-go cheesecake.  We probably won't plan on going to this location again unless it's during the off hours."}
{"text":"Great service. This has become one of my all time favorite dishes. Cheesecake Las Vegas you did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"There is always a wait it seems, but the food is worth the wait. The bread they bring out is warm, soft and so tasty. The Factory Nachos with chicken are so very yummy and the chicken enchiladas are really good, but completely Americanized. If you like real Mexican food like my husband and me, then this is not the place to get it. The portion sizes are large and good for sharing if you're going in a larger party or on a date. Marcus our server was good. Food came out fast. Nachos were so big we had to take the enchiladas home."}
{"text":"We came here for a late dinner. The reason this is not a 5 start review is because the food is not fantastic.  We had Jeremy and Jose as our waiters at the bar. They were awesome guys. We spoke about Hawaii worth Jose. The stuffed mushrooms have breadcrumbs in it is we had to return that. I hate wasting food. We also just shared the luau salad.  It was decent. But the service made up for the food. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"First a score of 1 is pretty shitty and I don't just give it to any establishment. 

Extremely disappointed.  Have been to many different locations especially in California and always had an exceptional experience especially loved Redondo Beach.. So was so excited to learn they were coming to Madison. 

Was waiting to dine next week with friends and family for a celebration but really couldn't wait any longer for cheesecake so I just popped in to grab some cheesecake to go on my way to work.

Five people at the cheesecake counter, 3 packaging and 2 cashiers. I look at the case take my pick and see there's a whole refrigerator with sliced up pieces ready to be served. So, much to my surprise it took literally 20 mins to package two slices of over priced cheesecake and put whipped cream on the side. 

No it was not busy it was 330pm on a Wednesday. I seen people waiting to be seated with plenty of seats open, it looked disorganized and I walked away with a really bad feeling of the place. 

What's worse is not the wait time but the ridiculous size of my $8 slice of cheesecake. I paid $16+ for two slices of mini cheesecake. See picture attached. I recall my other experiences and just receiving this big slice of cheesecake that makes you feel like you got your bang for your buck. This feeling was I got was more along the lines of ripped off and now I'm running late for work. 

I have no plans to return at this time to this particular location. I think I've seen and experienced all I need to.  What I really want is a refund so I can take that to buy a cheesecake for the same price at Target that won't have me feeling like I just got jipped for my time and money."}
{"text":"Always good service. Food consistent. BUT ITS ALWAYS FREEZING COLD IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION. I sometimes don't want to dine due to fact it's unbearably cold."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype for this place. the food is average at best and the sevice is terrible. maybe I had a bad experience? even the cheesecake was 3 stars at best ."}
{"text":"Great experience because no one argued with me here at Cheesecake! Shoutout to the Drake fans who get the reference.

Huge portions here and great for family sharing type of dinner. The prices reflect the huge portions and decent quality. 

Service was quick and they were really friendly and helpful in helping me make my order. I opted for the fettuccini Alfredo which is always a classic."}
{"text":"The waiter was fantastic. ..most of the food was good but my daughter's medium rare steak was more medium well, and when we sent it back, the manager Michelle came out and argued with us. Meanwhile everyone else had finished and she was hungry so she ate the overcooked steak. We hear Michelle is leaving, but I'll call and ask before I come back. This was a party of 6, we spent a lot of money and she was extremely rude."}
{"text":"Interesting for breakfast on Sunday which is unexpected and given the wait at all other places really great choice for a larger party instead of waiting at another place."}
{"text":"If you like things overdone, then the Cheesecake Factory is for you.

The menu is HUGE.  The positive is that it offers tons of choices so even the pickiest eater can find something.  The downside is that it can be very difficult to choose unless you are in the mood for something in particular. 

This location has a large seating area and also offers outdoor patio seating.  We went on a Thursday evening and were able to be seated right away.  

Service was friendly and efficient.  She was attentive but not intrusive.   

We tried the Buffalo Bites and the fried macaroni and cheese.  The Buffalo Bites were more than enough for a meal by themselves.  There were a lot of them there.  The flavor is spicy but not over the top.  One of my favorite items on the menu.  We also tried the macaroni and cheese balls.  They were tasty and although it doesn't seem like a lot (especially compared to the number of buffalo blasts) they are filling and worth ordering.

Entrees were pasta and the chicken bam bam.  Both portions were HUGE and enough to serve at least two or three people.  The positive on that was leftovers for two additional meals.  Both were flavorful and we would order both of them again.  

Not that either of us had the room for it, but we both ordered cheesecake.  I went for the red velvet cheesecake and my husband ordered the cherry cheesecake.  Topped with a generous dash of whipped cream, the size of the pieces was substantial (as they should be for $7 a slice).  They were tasty and stood up well to being eaten several days later as part of our leftovers.

I was disappointed they discontinued the salted carmel pretzel drink, but other than that, this was a top notch visit to the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was great from the service to the food and drinks. I ordered a Long Island ice tea and it was probably the best one I've ever had. Our server Rae greeted us promptly and showed us to the lunch specials, she did an awesome job. The manger delivered our food and was humorous, not the typical \"how is everything\" line you get at table touches. The food came out fast and was to die for. I got the almond crusted salmon and my friend got the garlic noodles with chicken. We both finished our plates and left very happy. Definitely will be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This restaurant really doesn't even deserve any stars. 

I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants in the US and, I have to say, this restaurant was by far the worst.

I can even handle the 2.5hr wait time. It's a new establishment and we went in around 630pm on a weekday. But what was unacceptable was the horrible service. Our server was Marc Anthony (not sure if this even was his real name). We had worked up quite the appetite by the time we were seated. We ordered our food immediately: factory nachos to share, Cajun jambalaya pasta, and chicken angel hair pasta. A few mins after ordering we were told by Marc Anthony that they had run out of nachos so no factory nachos. Fine. The sensible thing to do  then would be to bring out the bread basket as soon as possible to two people who had already waited over 2hrs, right? Apparently not. We never got a bread basket. In fact, Marc Anthony never came back to our table again until it was time to settle the bill. He never came back to refill the water. He never came back to ask how the food was (btw, food was deplorable. The Cajun shrimp pasta was burnt. The onions was literally charred. I only ate the shrimp and left the rest. My husband wasn't impressed with his food as well.) Instead, Mr. Marc Anthony would chat up the tables with only girls and openly flirt and swear with them. Clearly, professionalism was thrown out the window tonight.

If you want real cheesecake experience, just drive to Buffalo. It'll probably be faster than this poor excuse of an establishment."}
{"text":"This chain probably reached its peak about 2006.  This location is still very crowded on a regular basis.  Huge menu, somewhat confusing at times.  It does have a health conscious menu which is nice.  Then there are the cheesecakes -- yummy and certainly not healthy.  Service is OK, not spectacular.  We have used the curbside pickup option here.  Sometimes the folks are confused upon delivery, but the food transports well.  Overall, OK experience."}
{"text":"So this is the restaurant chain with the huge menu featured on Big Bang Theory.  As always, the structure looks like a theme restaurant at a Disney park.  There is the large menu and now a smaller lite menus.  They also have weekday happy hour with reduced prices on drinks and small plates.  Nice, attentive service.  Food arrived in a timely manner and was well prepared and flavorful.  My only complaint is that like many chain restaurants, the food is mildly overseeasoned.  Perhaps that encourages you to order more drinks.  Then there is the cheesecakes.  No they are not healthy, but they are amazing comfort food.  Overall, items are pricey, but portions are generous and you will iikely be taking leftovers home.  This is a great place to go after shopping or  movie.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Mom had the mushroom burger and my wife had the chicken sandwich and I had the catfish.  all the food was perfect.  i would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch New Year's Day , Andrew went above and beyond, and even though we were picky he was patient and made recommendations. I wasn't sure if I would like the drink I picked but he assured me I made a good choice and he was right! Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I like the Cheesecake factory although I know a few things are bound to happen everytime we go, I will be totally overwhelmed with their menu and it's going to be at least $100 tab no matter what.

Typically, I try to switch it up when I go because there are so many options to choose from. This time I got the skinnilicious farm fresh salad. I was impressed with the freshness and variety of veggies in it. 

The man got the shrimp scampi and was also satisfied with his selection. 

Our waitress was attentive, as they usually are. The drinks were good, as they usually are and we all enjoyed the evening. 

We opted out of the Cheesecake this time as we were all pretty full."}
{"text":"The hostess was so delightful. She limped over to show me my table. Apparently she hit the gym too hard but managed to laugh about it. I was seated and handed a book of a menu. They have an menu with around 200 choices.  This is good and bad. This could have been the reason for the confusion with my order. I ordered Parmesan herb crusted chicken but received a different dish. I ended up with a Parisian chicken with spaghetti.  I even told my waiter I thought my order was wrong since I was expecting different sides but he said it was correct that it was came with pasta. I started to eat my entree but asked for a menu. I looked up my entree and I was correct.  Even though I pointed it out to him pointed, he did nothing about it but said sorry for the confusion.  I wasn't in the mood for spaghetti or waiting for another entree to be prepared.  I felt this place was like a fancy dinner that offers too many choices at inflated diner prices. It specializes in cheese cakes but I figured if I ordered one I would end up with pudding. Haha. It's not a bad place to eat but you can find better along the strip."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here. It was my first time. I was not disappointed. I had the filet it was so good.  I could cut the steak with a butter knife. For desert, I had the ultimate cheese cake.  It was massive and delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant before and the food was good, however on this trip the food left a lot to be desired. I had visitors from out of town that requested to eat here. While we waited for our appetizers we saw the dishes coming from the kitchen and everything looked overbooked. When we received out tex mex rolls they were very different from when we have had them in the past and very bland. Not to mention the dipping sauce was just sour cream, which I know doesn't come with them. When my entree of the beef kabobs came it was entirely burnt. My boyfriend said I had Kingsford charcoal kabobs. I gave them to the manager and a new dish was made. During this visit I was disappointed due to it seemed like a lack of consistency in comparison to my past experiences."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I have been one of those people who has had nothing positive to say about Cheesecake Factory in the past (other than, they had awesome cheesecakes)...however, last night, after traipsing my in-laws all through the town, upstairs and downstairs in their nightgowns, trying to look for some dinner, we finally ended up here.

And it was AWESOME! Great service, delicious food, yummy drinks...they were 100% on point.

I wonder if perhaps I have just been choosing the wrong entrees all along, or if something has changed with them, but whatever the case, last night was awesome. 

At our table, we had two stand-out dishes, the chicken madeira with steak diane, and the caramel chicken something or other. The other two dishes were good, but nothing spectacular, and this is a review about what made me happy, so pbbbbbbbbbt!

So much so, that we ordered a couple of cheesecakes to go. The lemon raspberry cheesecake, by the way, is phenomenal...raspberry lady fingers, lemon cheesecake, fresh-ish whipped cream...yum yum! I'll have to wait to get feedback regarding the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake though.

So, that being said, I will no longer sully your name with negative comments or nay-saying...and I will be back. Thank you for a great evening."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, and the Lemonicello cake is probably the best thing I've ever eaten.  And trust me, I've eaten A LOT."}
{"text":"I don't get the appeal of this place. First, their menu is huge. As Gordan Ramsey would say, if the menu is big, then they are not good. That is because it takes a lot of staff to make a huge menu good. That being said, the food wasn't horrible. Went with the burger. It was ok. Just not worth the price and long wait for mediocre food. Cheesecake really isn't anything special either."}
{"text":"I ate too much.  But then again, that's why I love this place.  I've now been to about 6 different locations, and by far the service here is the best.  My food was fully cooked (which isn't always the case at other locations), we only waited 15 minutes (unheard of!), and the waitress was friendly and attentive.  As the Cheesecake Factory goes, you can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, absolutely horrible experience. After using the rest room I proceeded to wash my hands. The water was so extremely hot that it scolded my hands... I let a manager know and all they did was give me ice. So extremely thank fun that a child wasn't burned. Make sure you check the temperature of the water before you or your children wash your hands!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for the last several years and have yet to be let down with any of my trips here. When family or friends come to town and are not sure what they are in the mood for i bring them here. They have such a diverse menu and there is always something from everone. here are a few of my favorites.
-Grilled Mahi taco which i order %95 of the time
-Calamari as an App. always good and love the dipping sauce
-Chicken Costeletta- lighly breaded served with mash potatos and asparagus
-I have tried or sampled most of the pasta dishes my wife has ordered and haven't had a complaint about one yet.
-Corn fritters are delicious
-Cheese cake of coarse. I like most that i have tried but didn't like the red velvet one. too much icing overwhelmed what little cake was there, just not a good balance
- I always have a mojito or two or three...
Can't wait to go back, this location is always busy so plan for that in advance"}
{"text":"Ate here my first two days of vacation and on my first day the server tried to rip me off on my bill. When I told her she shorted me on my change she gave me a ride look and didn't apologize. My bill was $69.45 and when I went up to her she claimed that the bill was $70. I told her you cannot round my bill up and short me money. She finally gave me back my change difference after a good five minutes. Poor customer service. 

My second day the server I had brought us our waters with no straws and when we asked him for straws he put his finger tips all over the mouth pieces and then placed them in our drinks. I then told him we wanted sealed straws and he went and came back. During these three times he was at our table, not once did he ask us if we were ready to order he would look at our table and go to his other tables and help them. Very rude. I had to tell him we were ready to order and after a couple of times of me telling him we were ready he finally began to change his tune. I've never seen such poor service like this at the Cheesecake Factory. It's a great place to eat with a delicious menu, but the servers at this location are bad."}
{"text":"We came here as a large party of 10 at 1pm on a weekday and the wait was 1 hour! And they don't take reservations. 

I ordered their appetizer of chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps. I was not impressed. It was bland, one note, and had none of the lightness that I had hoped in ordering a lettuce wrap. Instead, it came on a bed of rice noodle puffs and with lettuce that was hardly conducive to actual wrapping. The lettuce was stalky and would have been better if I was eating it with a dip. Big leafy lettuce for lettuce wraps, please, like the kind that Vietnamese restaurants know to provide with their egg rolls. Moreover, the chicken and mushroom filling for my wrap looked brown and unappetizing. A bit of color would've made it more appealing, like some red bell peppers or green onions.  Plus the chicken was dry. 

The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their food though a couple of others also commented that some of their dishes were bland. Many of us ordered cheesecakes to go, but it took FOREVER. We even asked our waitress whether we should put in our to go orders as we put in our dine in order, and she said that we could do it at the end when we're ready for the check. So we did that, but then waited another good 30 minutes after paying the check for our to go orders to come out. It's no wonder the wait is so long to get seated here. Also, because we all ordered different kinds of cheesecakes, they brought it out to us but didn't label them or tell us what they were. It took some deduction on our part to figure which ones went with whom.  

The one bright spot was the key lime cheesecake I took home. Perfectly tart yet rich and buttery on the tongue. It was decadent. I savored each bite and wished I had also ordered the salted caramel cheesecake. 

It seems that people were very excited about Cheesecake Factory showing up in Madison, so maybe the wait will die down after a few months and they will figure out to make the service more efficient. Personally, I would not come back."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(312/365) \"The Default Dinner\"

Brain Fart-when you can't recall something that you wanted to say or mention, and its at the tip of your tongue, but still can't remember?

Food Fart-my term for when you are hungry, but you can't decide even with the HUNDREDS of dining options and cuisines in the 702 AND the Yelp App where you want to grab a bite to eat???? Anyone else run into this problem? 

Anywho, we were on this side of town and we didn't care for anywhere on the strip(don't think anyone who works on the Strip cares either)and we were Chinatown'd out (also a famous area for Dirty Dining lately...looking at you, Joyful House!) Prices are very reasonable here and the portions are HUMANGOUS which is why I like to order off their Small Plates Menu and I always get the Pear, Bleu Cheese,  and Pecan Flatbread which has always been consistently good. I also got the Veggie Fries Combo which came with Portabellos, Zucchini, and Avocados. The avocados were my least favorite because they have no business being in the fryer IMO. These are one of those things that are great as-is.

Totally stuffed from dinner, we had no room for dessert, but we were pleased with our meal.  This is the first time though that our server kinda sucked. She just looked like she didn't want to be there...lucky we didn't let her ruin our visit. Next time you find yourself having a food fart, Cheesecake Factory may just be a good option!   ALOHA!!!!

{"text":"We've been to this CF twice already,  both times for Sunday Brunch. If you read the rest of the reviews here, lots of people have issues regarding service. I get that this is a new location and it takes time to work out the kinks, but people just gotta take a chill pill!!!

Our first visit, we split the Chicken Chilaquiles and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, both were excellent,and the food came out in a timely matter. Our server couldn't answer a few questions about a few of the menu items we had, but no big deal..everything else was good.

This recent visit over EDC weekend, once again, we went for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and this time we ordered the Chorizo Chicken Hash with Poached Eggs.
We noticed however that our waitress seemed preoccupied and didn't seem happy. We had a few questions about things and  got short answers. We knew something was up. Now at this point, people  would dock a star or two regarding service,  but upon returning, Wifey asked politely \"Having a rough day?\"

Our waitress stepped back with a big sigh and apologized explaining the start of her day with a huge  power outage, EDC traffic, getting the kids ready, and getting ready for work all at the same time, so finding this out, we kinda sympathized with her and assured her that the worst part of her day was over, and whaddayouknow? Her demeanor did a 180...some people just need some positive reinforcement ya know?  Drinks were refilled, checked up on us periodically, and even the manager came by and was apologetic when she saw our food hadn't arrived yet!? We didn't feel  like it was a long wait, probably because I was engaged in conversation with my hot date across me...; )

When our food did arrive, the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were bomb as always, and The Chorizo Chicken Hash was perfection. From the perfectly oozing poached egg (lots of places have a hard time doing this) to the extra crispy hash I requested, no complaints here! Call me loco, but I prefer the  Cheesecake Factory over some of the other breakfast /brunch spots in town! ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Came back for dinner because we're big fans of the small plate menu, which allows us to try lots of different things.

On this visit, we grubbed on our usual Vietnamese Tacos(AKA Bao), Samosas, Beet Salad, Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread, and tried a new item, Roasted Shishito Peppers, which was a VERY generous serving. How generous? 45 peppers! (Ichiza gives you even less per order) As always, everything was great and very filling. 

Stop in and try their small plates, you don't know what you're missing out on!....ALOHA!!!!

{"text":"I am a Cheesecake Factory fan so this is easy for me.  This one is in the back of the mall (Forum shops) at Cesar's Palace.  I just discovered the buffalo blasts (appetizer) ... You MUST try these!!!  YUMMY!  Solid service and a very consistent menu. Thanks CF!"}
{"text":"M'kay, so, like - I'm probably one of only five other people on the PLANET who'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Why?  Dunno - just haven't, sue me.  Well, this location is in the Vegas Premium outlet center and after losing my mind in Michael Kors and other stores, it was time to eat and get out before I had to get a 2nd mortgage on my house to support my shopping habit.  

Anyhoo - the atmosphere is nice, decor is great - the low marks I give this are for the 1) service and 2) regular food.  I have been to the sister spot, Grand Lux and GL seems to be better to me.  As far as service, our waiter was SLOW and had attitude.  It took forever to just get water, he forgot to bring bread to our table and when I told him one of the things I wanted was for to-go he got snippy with a 'you should have said that first' - UM, excuse me?  Anyway, the salad I ordered to eat there was over chopped - that may be weird to say but I like to see whole leaves in my salad - this one was over chopped like shredded lettuce in the store.  But it tasted good.  My friend ordered these buffalo chicken tenders that for some reason had the buffalo sauce on the inside - nah - I gotta skip that in the future, that's just not right to do to chicken. 

BUT - the Turkey burger is BAE!!!  That tasty somenother gave me LIFE!!!!!  The caramelized onions on it are the thing dreams and rainbows are made of...... mind you I ate this later on in the day in my hotel room after several rounds of drinks but trust me, my taste buds know good burgers even if they are reheated. 

There is location near my house and I intend on stopping in to grab some cheesecake (the one thing I did NOT do on this visit) - so we'll see if I feel better about them then.  Otherwise, pass for me, I'll Grand Lux it out."}
{"text":"My nephew Eli will now be 24. My daughter Ruby is deciding where to take him. She went with cheesecake factory because of the menu selecion. Everything here is so delicios.

Our server was Damire (Dee) G- great great VERY attentive. Thank you all from Andrew, to the runners n D. My mother in law had the Fish and Chips n House salad, S had the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp and I had the Old Fashioned Monterrey Jack Cheese  Burger w/fries...yummy yummy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory prior to yesterday afternoon.  We arrive at 3:30 on a busy and beautiful day at Crocker Park.  We are seated immediately and after reviewing possibly the most extensive menu I've seen we decide on Chicken and Biscuits for me, and a BBQ Chicken pizza for my wife.  The food comes out within ten minutes and is pretty good.  My dish consisted of three very thin skinless boneless chicken breasts that have been sautéed with peas, carrots, mushrooms, and onions.  Also came with two \"Buttermilk Biscuits\" that looked and tasted exactly like cornbread (wth?), and mashed potatoes with the red skins left on.  The dish is very good, but I am disappointed that a menu the size of War and Piece did not mention that the mashed potatoes had red skins left on, and that the dish came with peas, onions, carrots, and mushrooms.  My wife's pizza was also very good though a slight criticism would be that it had too much chicken, and that was a little dry.  To finish the meal off we shared a piece of red velvet cheesecake which was one of the best desserts I've had.  Overall we give the food four stars.

Now about the service:  it was not very good.  We happened to be seated at a table very close to the waiter / waitress station which unfortunately for me, was all I could see.  The waitresses dancing, one waitress hitting the other on the butt, seven of them all standing around as if they had nothing to do - it just wasn't what I wanted my view to be inside of this beautiful, expansive space.  The Cheesecake Factory would be smart to create an area where the wait staff can stand out of the view of the customers.  Our waiter was not very good, and he didn't check on us often, and was not good at refilling our drinks.  He also left at one point and came back to our table smelling terribly of cigarette smoke - it was disgusting and to me, not appropriate.  I'm not sure if waiters taking smoke breaks while they are in the process of waiting on a table is common, but I can't remember having this experience previously.  We give the service two stars overall.

The bill with a 15% tip was $52.  We will be back, but that is based solely on the location, and most notably the food which was very good."}
{"text":"I walked in with my daughter and this waiter Chris made sure that I will get the right order the way I want it. He carefully asked for my preference and made awsome effort to achieve what Ive wanted. Very attentive and pleasing service. Unfortunately, we had to change server because of the sitting issue, then Phil was the one that replaced Chris and he provided me the same excellent customer service. I was very happy as Iam not a local I like to have pleasant moment during my vacation and one of them is dining with great experience at restaurants that I like. 

I give 5 star to these men who provided excellent customer service to their customers and willing to make efforts all the time!!!"}
{"text":"Great location in Kierland. Shrimp pasta, carbonara spaghetti and herb crust salmon were just perfect. Our waitress was kind. Price is ok for this area. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Happy hour at Cheesecake is the best!  (So that is purely what my review is based on!)  Super friendly servers, great drinks and excellent food!  Compared to the normal prices (which are pricey) happy hour is a great time to come in and get all the best appetizers for excellent deals!  Go and enjoy!"}

Our party was all there at 250 and they still didn't seat us till 340!!!! It was horrible.. no one should wait that long for a table ..Our waiter was great thank god, but my daughter ordered the chicken parmesan, pizza style and it was horrible...It was like cardboard with speghett on top...Pretty big disapointment"}
{"text":"I've had a few bad experiences here, but this was the worst. I was given a time of 15-20 minutes to pick up my food, and I showed up in 18 minutes. I called curbside and notified them I was there. Fast forward over 45 minutes and 3 curbside phone calls later, I cancelled my order. The lady on the phone was rude and ended with a \"whatever.\" Each time I called, they said they were heading out the door, but they weren't and the last time I asked for an actual estimate, but she couldn't give me that."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I have to say, they must have stepped it up since I've been there last. I'd never been to this one, but it is closer to home, so decided to take the family here for dinner. 

Parking wasn't too bad. We parked in the Parking Garage B right off Bonneville. Took us maybe 5-8 minutes to find parking and we walked across the street from the parking garage to the restaurant. The restaurant has valet too so if you prefer not to deal with the parking, I highly advise. The front entrance to the restaurant is off of the street side across from the garage. You can also enter from another door that is deeper inside the mall, but then you have to walk through the dining room to get to the hostess area at the front. 

For appetizers, the family and I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls (delicious) and an assortment of varied spring rolls which were also very good. 
 
I ordered Evelyn's Famous Pasta. As to be expected, the portion size was huge! Everything in the dish tasted fresh and not overly cooked. The broccoli had a bit of crispness left to it and the mushrooms weren't soggy! It was very good. 

Hubby had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and even he said he was surprised how great it was! 

The wait time wasn't too bad for our food. Noise level is normally pretty high overall and that is to be expected too. The dinner here was a pleasant surprise overall. I hope it continues to be so!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory food is good. Waitress are on point. And the cheese cake is out of this world.love the area it's in southpark.and the family loves it also."}
{"text":"Our last three visits to this CF (August to Sept 6) have been sub-par at best. Staggered order delivery with 15 minute gaps, 55 minute long waits for food, cold items, absent wait staff (reeking of smoke)... It used to be great and we visited more than the typical patron, but it's time to give it a rest until management addresses clear staffing and structure problems at this location."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant. The staff here is really nice and every time I have a special request with my order they are always willing to comply. Not one negative thing to say about this place. Great customer service, great food, and an all around great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Despite not being very busy the service was extremely slow. I was there to celebrate my Mom's birthday and her food was brought out several minutes after everyone else's. She had soup, salad and a sandwich. How hard is it to get that timed right to come out with the rest of the meals? My pasta was over cooked and quite bland. I've always enjoyed other locations so hopefully they were just having a bad day."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here after a movie and we enjoyed it experience. We have been to this Cheesecake Factory before and have always had a good experience. We went on a Wednesday and it was still pretty busy. The wait for 2 was around 20 minutes so we decided to sit in the bar at a high top for no wait. We, of course, started off with their bread. The brown honey oat bread is always delicious and so is the sourdough. 

My wife order the zucchini appetizer and I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. The zucchini were good and crisp and had good flavor. The spicy chipotle chicken pasta was awesome. It had really good flavor and just the right amount of spice for me. The other plus is that this dish was HUGE. It lasted me 3 meals. One of the things that I really enjoyed about the dish was the tortilla crisps that were added at the end. It really gave the dish a nice texture. I would really recommend the dish if you go. 

We finished off the night with red velvet cheesecake and a banana cream cheesecake. They were both very good and I would recommend them both as well."}
{"text":"I came here with a party of 4 on a Friday afternoon and everything was fine. The Cheesecake Factory for the most part has pretty average food I feel.  The service was fine, our drinks were refilled quickly.  Our waitress was friendly.  I'm a really big fan of the fact when you order Ginger Ale you get it in a Canada Dry Glass bottle with a cup to pour it in. Our table ended up getting: 

Fresh Basil, Tomato and Cheese Flatbread - This small plate was very small.  I would have enjoyed had the pieces been a little bigger as the tomatoes were almost the same size as the piece of flatbread themselves. 

Skinnylicious Factory Chopped Salad- Julienne Romaine, Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon. Blue Cheese and Apple with Our Vinaigrette.  The person got this because it was under 500 calories and it was enjoyed.  You get a lot of salad in it. 

Skinnylicious Asian Chicken Salad- Grilled Chicken, Romaine, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Green Onions, Cilantro, Rice Noodles, Wontons, Almonds and Sesame Seeds Served with Our SkinnyLicious® Sesame-Soy Dressing.  The one complaint on this one was there was barely any salad dressing on this so she just had to order an extra side of it

Sweet Potato Fries with Aioli Sauce -  The fries were okay, I've had some with much better seasoning and flavoring, felt the fries didn't have a ton of flavor, the aioli sauce did help though. 

Overall this isn't a bad place to come if you are shopping in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is awesome here! There is so many to chose from too! The Mac and cheese bites are a must try here. I wasn't impressed with the quesadillas, I would not recommend them at all."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Service tends to be very good. In fact, cheesecake factory hold the position of having the best waiter I have ever had. Turns out he was one of their trainers.

The food has always been solid. Consistent. Tastes great. The crusted chicken Romano is fantastic. The sauce on the noodles hits the perfect balance of flavour.

Fried Mac and cheese is a nice appy.

It is a bit on the pricy side, but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week and they are gangbusters busy.  However, the service felt seamless and our server was very nice.  I ordered the Louisiana pasta lunch special and it was okay...in comparison to other options there was only a small portion of chicken. I was a little taken back since typically Cheesecake provides large portions."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

I'm not a huge fan of reviewing store chains, especially restaurant chains. 

When I'm writing a review, I want to make sure I am adding something unique, that perhaps someone didn't already know. Since chains are everywhere, everyone has already tried them so chain reviews usually basically come down to rehashing information we all already know or become a report card on what we thought of the service.

It's easy to look down on chains or take them for granted because they're probably run by a giant faceless corporation or some big fat cat. 

One of the notable exceptions is The Cheesecake Factory. 

THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY: THE HISTORY 

The Cheesecake Factory started in 1978 from an idea that a son of a baker couple had to showcase his mother's cheesecakes, as well as to add a restaurant.

The Cheesecake Factory has a certain je ne sais quoi quality and is impressively successful operating on such a grand scale. 

What do I mean?

AMBIANCE 

The Cheesecake Factory is stunning and huge. There is the main dinning room, the bar and bakery areas. Each could conceivably operate on their own. The high ceilings with all the art work is pretty amazing. The craftsmanship of the bar is gorgeous. The whole restaurant is very well appointed. (see pics)

THE MENU

The Cheesecake Factory menu is massive. Not just in the quantity of items, but the scope as well. 

The menu features:
Appetizers/Small Plates/Snacks
Salads
Pizza 
Glamburgers/Sandwiches
Pastas
Steaks/Chops/Fish/Seafood
Eggs/Omelettes

There are 2 new sections:
\"Super\" Foods & Skinnylicious

\"Super\" Foods are nutrient rich special recipes with high sources of antioxidants. 

Some of these include:
Falafel Salad
Super Antioxidant Salad
Vegan Cobb Salad
Kale & Quinoa Salad

Skinnylicious are a collection of fresh & delicious menu options all at 590 calories or less. 

Obviously, desserts include cheesecake. 
Like ALL the cheesecakes ever invented!

Drink menu is extensive & creative. 

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

The Cheesecake Factory has a pretty consistent high level of service. Occasionally, there is a surly server, but it is rare. 

CONCLUSION 

5/5 RECOMMEND 

OF NOTE

*The Hours: 11am - 12am

*Extras:

Catering
Gift Cards
Ship A Cheesecake

Now think of all of those things I listed and multiply by 5 Phoenix Valley locations. 
(Chandler, Mesa, Biltmore, Kierland, & Peoria)
To have 5 massive restaurants all in the same city (over 200 locations total) and to be as successful as they are, for as long as they have been, is impressive and rare. 

The ability to just stop in to an epic environment with constantly high level & varied products and excellent service is beyond impressive, which unfortunately can be taken for granted.

{"text":"Service was not good.  Food was OK.  Won't be going there again. Had to wait 20 min to get in.  Waiter was no where to be found.  We decided on not leaving a tip."}
{"text":"Although I love indulging in their desserts, the carrot cake blended with cheesecake is my favorite, the recent inspection earned them a health score of only 83!  Unacceptable for this well known chain!  I might return when it improves."}
{"text":"Our appetizer was the firecracker salmon and it was AMAZING. They taste and texture... And even the cabbage it came in was good! No complaints on that!

I was feeling a salad so i got the Carlton salad and it was pretty damn good. The tangerines on it were super juicy and tasty and there was no issue with the greens. The only problem was there was barely any chicken on it! For a 12.00 salad i expected a little bit more. But all in all was satisfied.

The cheesecake, ohhh the cheesecake. I got the red velvet cake cheesecake and it was to die for. Thw cake part was super moist and the rest was rich and creamy. I refused to waste one bite!

Our server was great, had a good sense of humor and was very attentitive. 

We went at like 12:30 so there was no wait and everything came out fast."}
{"text":"For my first time ever! This was awesome great service. I got a spicy chicken sandwich.. It was totally wicked. Greatest food experience yet. Presentation was on point"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and extensive menu. I partcularly like our booth as it felt private. Excellent, non-pushy comfortable service. The choices in cheescake is unbelievable  !! Like 7 bucks but plenty to share with your date :)"}
{"text":"We went to The Cheesecake Factory for Cheesecake , after our waite , we ordered 
the Server came back and told us \" Im Sorry , all of our Cheescakes are frozen \" it was 830pm . 
Maybee we should have gone to a diffrent place ......"}
{"text":"I give three stars because service started out okay, it took a tad bit longer for the server to greet us. Once greeted she definitely seemed rushed. The food was very good, as usual. Service just was so detached, the bartender who brought our drinks was better then our server. I know it's a job but she should at least fake it for the sake of her tip, we ALWAYS tip well above 20% so she is lucky to of had us and not one of those $5 tippers. Let me add one of our guest never received their meal, it was boxed to-go; the meal was comped but still you don't go out to eat to take it back home and reheat it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's day on Valentine's day. you can only imagine how busy they would be on Valentine's day but we chose to sit outside and there was no wait. micheal was our server and helped us decide what to order with his great recommendations. even though the reaturant was extremely busy Michael was very attentive. we were in and out of the reaturant in an hour. I was so shocked and happy."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is a go to celebration spot for me and my friends. If only they took reservations and the lighting wasn't so dim. But on a Monday night my party of 8 got a table without having to wait. Service here always tends to be pretty slow in my experience, but the food is good. I always get full on the bread (specifically the brown bread) before my meal but manage to push through in the end. Buffalo Blasts are on the top of my list but my friend got them the other night and they weren't as crispy as usual and she was disappointed. All the cheesecakes I've had here are yummy, but my favorite dessert is the Strawberry Shortcake. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"We have been here over a dozen times and its usually pretty good.  We love their salads & pasta dishes!  Everything is humongous and I can eat!   
We went there yesterday & we shared 2 items!  We had a large BBQ Chicken Salad (14.50) & a lunch portion Louisiana Chicken Pasta (10.95)
My wife just started a diet so didn't want to eat much carbs(pasta) so I devoured most of that dish as well as half of the huge salad.  Maybe that's why I weigh like 5 pounds more today!  haha

Another good salad is Santa Fe Salad..but we were hesitant to order it because the cook didn't make it awesome like we had it the 1st time!
Other great dishes are Orange Chicken & Chicken Avocado club is good with their fries & must ask for their ranch!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at me and my fiancée had a great time there and the waiter was great at her job. I would recommend going back again soon"}

{"text":"Cheesy is great, lettuce wraps were spot on and our server was excellent.
I wish I knew her name as she was very attentive and accommodating hence we all gave her a nice gratuity."}
{"text":"I went for happy hour with a friend and we ordered two appetizers: the Parmesan garlic bread and the fried macaroni and cheese, and one entree of Chicken di Panna. The bread was really delicious and we enjoyed the fresh garlic and olive oil. The marinara(?) sauce was very out of the jar tasting. The fried mac and cheese breading was heavier than we remembered. Of course by the time the entree arrived, which we were splitting, we were pretty full! But we were sat almost immediately, our server was very attentive with wine knowledge, and our glasses were never empty."}
{"text":"I have changed my mind several times as to whether to make it two stars or three...

The food is occasionally very good, but most often it is merely serviceable--you'll eat it, you won't be hungry afterwards, but two days later you won't be able to recall what it was you ate. I suspect that has something to do with the extensive \"something for everybody\" menu, which makes me think no single kitchen could prepare all of these dishes with equal skill. Thus, some items might be sort of roughed out in the kitchen by the cooks, while others are done with flourish and panache.

It is a ridiculous amount of food presented on the plate, and I would be a more frequent guest there if the food cost 2/3 as much and the portion was proportionately reduced. I likewise won't bother with a 20-40 minute wait--I'll eat in the food court, save myself about $30 for the wife and me (especially with no wine), and stop by on the way out for some cheesecake slices to go.

Finally, I prefer eating outside when the weather permits. It isn't a great view (the parking lot) but the noise level is much lower than inside. Modern restaurant designers seem to have a fetish for hard surfaces within the dining area, reflecting kitchen noise and patron conversation into an enormous dull din. Supposedly, this creates a sense of energy in the place; for me, it is more like eating in a construction site. If inside is all that is available, I'm heading back to that food court..."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty neat that there's a Cheesecake Factory at the North Premium Outlets. After a long day of shopping, a good meal is always a great idea.

I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad & it was good. The serving was huge & it was tasty.

My party of 17 was seated in the extended seating section. The area is more private, less busy, not as noisy, more windows, & the lighting was brighter. It was great to be seated there, but we were also forgotten by our server. After ordering our meals, she didn't come back to check up on us & we had to call another server to get her attention a couple times (or even requested for items from a different server since that seemed quicker). 

Despite this, the food was good, their free bread is delicious, & the ambiance was like all the other Cheesecake Factory chain."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the wait and the cost! I was very disappointed at how hyped up this restaurant was. Service was slow, food was mediocre - it was like something I could cook up in my own kitchen. My friend got very sick from the pasta they served us. The only thing preventing me from giving a 1 star is the servers - they were lovely and super nice about everything - and the cheesecake.

Definitely would not recommend coming here for the food besides the Cheesecake."}
{"text":"Really not worth the price / wait time. I can name multiple mom and pop shops with better prices, portions, and 75% less salt."}
{"text":"Terrible, horrible, no good, very bad service. I ordered two pieces of cheesecake to go at the counter and it took 35 minutes for them to ring up the order so I could leave and be on my merry way. It wasn't like there was a problem with the register, no it was the complete lack of attention from the staff. For 7.50 a slice of cheesecake you would think they would be more attentive! Will not be back. Too expensive and obviously they do not care about a customer."}
{"text":"The place was crowded... The food was good.... The cheesecake was over the top delicious! The service could have been better... Waiting to long for drink refills. . Overall i will be returning for the cheesecakes.. Finger licking good"}
{"text":"I had southwest salad.  red velvet cheesecake mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I had a delicious dinner. The chicken piccata was EXCELLENT!!! I am definitely a fan of angel hair pasta, and this one has a lemon sauce that just kept calling my name. The mushrooms and capers topped it off real fine. 
   The waiter was fantastic. He had a great sense of humor and was very observant. The bartender knows how to make a mean amaretto sour. 
   Can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake..... The choices go on and on. I decided on the cherry cheesecake and I was not disappointed. It was good to the last bite. 
    Wish we had a Cheesecake Factory in Charleston, SC.
     10 out of 10!!!
YUMOLA!!!!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this location since the last review in 2009!  Well M has been having a horrible 2 weeks.  She picked Cheesecake for lunch, I never say no to Cheesecake!!  We were quickly sitted.  Our server came over quickly to take drink orders...  I had to order the TexMex eggrolls too!  

I got the Chicken Alfredo lunch.  It was very good, creamy and the noodles were done perfectly.  Only 1 minor complain, 5 chunks of chicken, REALLY?  

Got my usual Vanilla Bean Cheesecake to top off the visit!!!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is always one of those staple go to places yes I know it is a chain but you can always count on their happy hour with good prices and a ton of stuff on the menu to order. M and I came here and ordered 4 things and still have room for dessert! Of course we took a lot of it home. But the service is always spot on without asking for refills. And the complimentary bread is always very good. I always like getting different things for the happy hour menu but when I do order from the regular menu I always order the chicken Romano."}
{"text":"I choose Cheesecake Factory for my birthday lunch. I love that many many MANY choices you have. And if you there before 5pm, you can order a lunch portion (dinner portions are HUGE). The service is always great. 

My favies: 
Tex Mex eggrolls 
Romano crusted chicken 
Vanilla bean cheesecake 
Red velvet cake cheesecake 
Burgers 
Pasta dishes... 
I have not gotten anything I did not like yet!"}
{"text":"I've been to several of this chain's locations and usually my reaction strikes the middle of the road. I have to say however, I have been particularly impressed with this location. The food has always been well prepared, the service above average, and now with the convenient curbside to-go service where they bring it out to the car, I've upgraded my review. This is one chain where we could be regulars."}
{"text":"Normally I never visit chains as I detest them, but on a Sunday night Mother's Day, there really was nowhere else to go. It was either between this place and Red Devil and I wish we just would have went to Red Devil instead. They do not take reservations but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the wait was non-existent on this night and we were seated right away.

The waiter took our drink orders and my sister was the only one that didn't want lemon in her drink and he was kinda rude about that, something about making his job more difficult or something but whatever. The menu is huge and they have a Skinnylicious menu that features light menu items if you are watching your weight. 

Pretty much anything that you could want is on the menu; italian, asian, american, etc. and let's not forget that cheesecake! The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong. OMG Red Velvet layer cheesecake is 7.95 a slice as they are all aptly priced but it is a huge slice enough for two people.  The mango passion tea is great as were their mixed drinks which are $9.25++

I got the veggie burger which was okay, nothing groundbreaking in flavor or toppings, sauces etc. The fries were a bit disappointing and the food presentation was pretty disappointing and lackluster. My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill. So somewhat disappointing considering this is Mother's Day and I wanted my mom to at least enjoy her meal.

Summary: Food so-so-may change on a variable basis, Service-abyssmal, we never even got our water glasses refilled, another waitress stepped on my sister's foot but refused to move in a timely manner. I'm going to have to pass on this one unless I need cheesecake in the near future. The validated parking is free with a two hour limit."}
{"text":"The wait was less then 10 minutes even though it was dinner time and the crowd was wrapped around the waiting area!! Service was impeccable and the food was amazing. Sure thing if you want to enjoy your experience!!!"}
{"text":"Went here to grab dessert on the way home after a horrific experience at another eatery. The fellow at the dessert counter was pleasant, very sweet & helpful, and basically redeemed our evening. Next time we want a nice night out we will skip the BS at other places and just come to Cheesecake Factory. The service is awesome, the staff is unfailingly nice, and oh yeah - CHEESECAKE!!!"}
{"text":"After being told the wait was on 10 minutes just 15 minutes had passed so I walked up to the hostess counter and was placed into another area.I suppose the wait was ten minutes to be placed into this area rather than to be seated, after waiting an additional 20 minutes we were seated near the kitchen area with a large column aside our 2 person table.When we asked to be seated we were told it wasn't possible,we ended up walking out because it was so loud where we sat due to the kitchen being so close.On our way out we saw 3 other two person seating areas and our waitress.This happen about a month ago but it sucked so bad I wanted to make sure to post about it, so yea if you don't have time to burn and you enjoy being able to hear who you are dining with while you enjoy your meal, this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Service was sub standard to say the least. The waitress had an attitude from the beginning as well as my friends omelette was cold from the kitchen. I asked for a cup of chili which she said I could do then brought me soup of the day and got more attitude when I questioned that. Even walked off from our table mumbling under her breath. Once food came she never came back to see if we needed anything or to see if we wanted another beverage. Then we sat and waited and waited for her to come by and give us our check and go boxes. Additionally instead of picking up my glass by the base to move it out of the way she grabbed it by the top with her hand over the top. Very unsanitary. Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory today."}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory is always good. Because it sells cheesecake. All over this country.  It's the same menu. It's the same great food.  It's the same cheesecake, so what makes one better than another? Why even write a review?   Service.  This cheesecake factory has on hand a young man by the name of John.  He was prompt, polite, funny ( sometimes hard to be both!) , & gave great recommendations.  Made Made what would have been an alright dinner out into a fun dinner out."}
{"text":"I usually am pleased by The Cheesecake Factory but this time I will say it was a horrible experience. First off it was my mistake going on a friday night and waiting 30min to get seated but then after being seated it took another 20min just for someone to come and ask if there was anything that we wanted to drink. Finally after ordering it took forever to get the food AND it was the complete wrong appetizer, not once but twice. Usually when you receive your food asa common curtesy your asked if everything looks alright or how it is. Well not once were we asked. Lets just say the service was beyond awful.

The drinks, well i can say that the drinks are always good, this time i ordered the green tea which was great and it was delicious. The food on the other hand was not so enjoyable. I ordered the stuffed tortilla which was not a stuffed tortilla, it was more like a quesadilla thrown together with an odd tasting corn patty. Not a fan. My issue about cheecake's food is just that they can't decide what they want to serve. There is just too much variety which means there is a great selection but the food is just bland.

Overall, my recent trip was a bad experience due to the service and the bland food. The Cheesecake factory is a good place to go with a group of people that cant decide what they want to eat but otherwise if you really want great food i wouldn't recommend The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! If my wife didn't like the cheesecake I would never go. Waited in the cheesecake counter for 10 min with 4 waiters standing at the side before being acknowledged. The. Took another 10 minutes to take my order and box some cheesecake. This place deserves a negative rating!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Forum shopping Arcade in Caesars Palace this place is always a more casual dining treat. Everytime we have gone to Vegas the wait is usally about 20 minutes but with the fish tank outsaide and the laser light show it helps kill time!!! 

The food keeps up the great standards of Cheesecake Factory. The staff makes sure your taken care of, the only time you will  really wait is when paying the bill. But I think they do that on purpose the more you wait the more time you have time for your food to digest then you get hungry and get a slice of Cheesecake!! haha"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants near me. I've been there a bunch of times and almost everything I have ordered there tastes so amazing!
There is always a wait on the weekends, but sometimes I wait anyways because it is a true experience. 
They have amazing drinks though, their hot chocolate was so good that when we went to the location near the International Market in Hawaii, I still ordered it! 
I'm not a big eater, so I usually get appetizers as entrees. I usually order the fried calamari or the cheese bread, and I think it's pretty simple , but simply delicious. 
I wouldn't really recommend the cheesecakes. I sometimes order the cherry cheesecake and the cherries are too sweet (they are preserved), and the cheesecake doesn't taste good without anything with it. 
So overall, I would give it a 9.1. The drinks are amazing and so are the appetizers, but I wouldn't recommend the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Most Cheesecake Factory's are just meh, they aren't really that good, but they'll do. However this specific location sucks! We made a reservation and arrived on time, only to be told we could not be seated because out server was late to work. Our server, when she arrived, got all of our orders wrong, both our drinks and meals....well shes human, and people have bad days, its totally understandable....I can get past that. 
Now the food is what really made me say, \"fuck it, im never ever going back to any Cheesecake Factory again.\" I decided to order the walnut chicken, and it was unbelievably salty! The cheesecake was also meh, and I really regret consuming these calories...IF Chessecake factory is your thing, go to a different location..."}
{"text":"While my server was excellent, the hostess was curt and somewhat rude. She also sat us in the half booth section in the center of the restaurant despite it being late with other seats available. This seat was particularly obnoxious as we were right next to the server order station and numerous servers \"hung out\" there to chat with each other and put in orders. Since there is no boundary between the server station and the seat, it's like a group standing over you and looking at you from your left side, squelching any chance at a private conversation with your dining companion. I probably won't come to this location again. I don't remember this same set up at the phoenix location. If it is the same hopefully they at least have a plant or something to break the line of sight from the server station down into the half booth."}
{"text":"I always forget how busy this place gets on a Saturday night. Plus there were big groups because of some HS Proms. The wait wasn't too bad. My server was super nice. He was attentive and was working hard for how busy his section was. I felt bad because he had a a very rude group who was complaining about everything and wanted everything compensated. I felt the manager could have stood up for him. Sometimes the customer isn't always right.  Plus when you eat half of the food then say it wasn't correct and expect to get it for free! Come on!!! 

I had the Herb Salmon with delicious mashed potatoes. I didn't realize there was going to be so much herb crust on my Salmon so I had to scrape some of it off. Their strawberry lemonade is amazing. Please try it!!! I had to eat some cheesecake. I went with the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries. Delicious 

The only negative thing I had was while eating outside they had a section where they left the dirty plates. This area was so loud and distracting while trying to eat when the workers were separating the dishes to be taken to the back. It just didn't sit well with me for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to have dinner here for our last night in Vegas and thank God we did because it was excellent from start to finish! We waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated, now there was only two of us but still it was nice not having to wait that long. Once we got our seats our waiter  came over and right away suggested some drinks since we were looking at the adult beverages (of course, hello we're in Vegas!) he told us the new blood orange margarita was great so we both went with that. SO good!!! I wish I would've gotten my waiters name because he was awesome! I ordered the combo of the steak Diana with salmon and it was delicious. The salmon didn't have the least bit of that fishy taste that most salmon has, the steak was perfect and the mashed potatoes were great too! Of course we got cheesecake as well, I got the s'mores and my friend got red velvet. One great thing after another with this place! I will say that when you're going to a Cheesecake Factory make sure you at least have an idea of what you'd like to eat because they have a huge selection on their menu so I don't think you wanna take the time and read each item with description on there."}
{"text":"Very nice place especially at Caesar's Palace. This was my first time trying dining at a Cheesecake Factory. The menu selection was huge."}
{"text":"I ordered from doordash and it was like 45 min wait not bad for New Year's Eve food was awesome"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years like over 10 yrs probably. Went here with the family the other day and I still like this place. 

We went for lunch it was pretty busy but we got sat immediately.They accommodated the whole family as far as seating including my newborn which some restaurants do not have proper seating for. As I'm looking through the menu I see a wide variety of different options they have a pretty big menu! My mother in law ordered appetizers she ordered two different artichoke dishes one was the fire roasted fresh artichoke and the other was fried artichoke I'd never tried it so id figure what the hell ill try it. Hmmm I guess I'm not a fan of artichoke I didn't like it at all yuck which sucks because there were a lot of different appetizers that sounded tasty that i would have ordered such as avocado eggrolls, chicken pop stickers, fried Mac and cheese, tex mex eggrolls,crab wontons or the crab cakes hmm I might have to come here and just order appetizers one day lol. Now for my main dish I decided to stick with what I remember ordering and liking years ago the fettuccine Alfredo I did the lunch special since pasta is filling I ordered the tropical tea to go with it. The fettuccine was ok not great just ok I remember it being better but I guess they changed the ingredients, the tea was refreshing and delicious. My hubster and mother in law were happy with their dishes my hubster got the BBQ hamburger and she got some type of salad. 

It pains me to rate it 3 stars because I'm pretty sure if I had ordered something else and a different appetizer it would of been 4 stars because the service was awesome and I just chose the wrong dish."}

{"text":"Went on a Monday evening and had a short wait for the table. It was busy. Our waitress was very busy. By the time she came to us we had already had plenty of time to look through the vast menu and decide.  I overheard the couple next to us complaining about the wait for their food and contemplated leaving. Well we should have. It took one hour to get any food. The bread she said she would bring, we had to ask her for 30minutes later as we were starving. Our appetizer came but the main course which were salads took another 20minutes. By that time we were full on apps and bread and had to package them to go. 
To top it all off the woman's restrooms were foul!!
So a Monday night dinner took 2 hours for a flat read and 2 salads with no meat on them."}
{"text":"I don't often go to dinner here, but mostly for happy hour, again this mama like to go out but lives on a budget. They have a little good happy hour that I think we should all take advantage of it once it a while. Do no the big fancy building intimidate you, they have cocktails and delicious appetizers for $5.00 each. I am South American so I always go for my MOJITOS!! epa! The bartender, Ryan, a.k.a. Carlos (My friend couldn't remember his name so we decided to call him Carlos and he is ok with it, but it's Ryan) We also order the Avocado eggrolls and the Chinese salad. My friends loves the margaritas, but I am not a tequila drinker (for obvious reasons since I am a light wright). Oh, and my favorite: The Peach Bellinis!!! They are not part of the happy hour menu but they are amazing!!! Please do not leave the restaurant without sharing a piece of cheesecake. The upside down pineapple is amazing!! One day after a movie date with this guy, we went there for late coffee and a cheesecake, it was nice, romantic, and sweet!! Just throwing some romantic ideas for you boys!! (wink, wink...)   

If you ever go the Scottsdale location and sit a the bar, ask for Carlos, he will probably have a laugh and will know exactly who and how you know his name LOL"}
{"text":"The manager came to us and asked us to move and we had asked why... he was aggressive cold and one worded. We had waited 35 minutes to be seated, I would think we can get an explanation. We are confused and he refused to share his full name , why we need to move and if somehow we could meet in the middle. He was more aggressive than anyone should treat anybody even outside of a restaurant. I am a regular and this was disappointing. His name is Amid! Now....I understand that people can be overwhelmed but no other cheesecakes who handles the same amount of stress would treat us the way he did. I'm am shocked. I literally don't want to support cheesecake if this is what they allow to handle the customers and certain circumstances. I would think a manager is hired to handle special situations accordingly. Not rudely and aggressive or cold. I'm shocked that cheesecake can allow this."}
{"text":"Great food, bad service. Very slow to get food and both entrees were wrong after 40 minutes. Manager did nothing to correct the situation. If we go back it will just be for take-out cheesecake."}
{"text":"Seated super quick. Was not busy at all. My girlfriend and I both got the Cajun jambalaya, which I loved, but she is from the south and said \"this is not jumbalaya\" lol. So that's why the 4 star. I'm not a cheesecake fan but she loved hers. Pricing is good for portion size.  Rest of the fam enjoyed their food and cheesecake."}
{"text":"The food was fine, nothing spectacular. The service on the other hand was terrible! On top of our waitress being really slow, someone in our party had a food allergy to dairy. While the food was prepared as they requested, the bun had what appeared to be a coat of butter on top. What the person asked the waitress to clarify, she was very rude and defensive and seemed reluctant to find out what the substance on the bun was. The manager came over and explained that it was margarine, but could not verify if their margarine contained dairy or not and also seemed reluctant to find out. He also made a comment about how they would have to remake the whole burger if it was, acting as if it was an inconvenience to him. Ultimately, they told the person they would bring them a PLAIN bun without the margarine on to be safe, but brought out a bun that still had something on it.  The person had to eat their burger with just the bottom bun because they didn't want to go through the  trouble of finding out what mystery substance was on that bun."}
{"text":"I didn't even have to eat here to know it wasn't good, when I walked in it smelled like the inside of a dishwasher, it was hot and sticky and it looked dirty prices are ridiculous like I get it's Canada but 10$ for one slice of cheesecake plus tax? yeet"}
{"text":"Great portions on everything. Always have doggy bags!!!!  Love to stop in after the movies a GVR."}
{"text":"I couldn't help myself and followed the hype and my stomach. No longer do we have to drive 2 hours to Buffalo but instead wait 2-3 hours in a mall.
It's exactly what you expect, the food is the same, the friendliness of the wait staff, the menus, the cheesecake line up at the door. We always order the Chicken Jumbalaya and Thai Lettuce wraps which are very tasty. This time we ordered the Buffalo Blasts, Stuff Potato Tots, Avocado Egg Rolls And Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta. The Angel Hair was nothing to brag about but we enjoyed the Buffalo Blasts which was a huge portion. We were disappointed that the pastas were not the expected large portions we are use to seeing in the US. We also ordered the Black Out Chocolate Cake and Godiva Gluten Free cake. They were both very rich and delicious. If you are willing to brave the wait and walk around the mall for 2-3 hours, you get what you expect."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but I am always pleases with my service. 

The Cheesecake Factory has adapted over the years and it's great to see. They now have smaller pasta portions in addition to their light caloric meals. Even their plating has improved. I usually order the Tex Mex egg rolls and they are plated much better now considering the price. 

Then there is the cheesecake. Well, it's great. The options seem endless and I haven't had one I don't like yet. I recently just started eating cheesecake and this is actually where I had my first piece, the key lime pie one. 

I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Very extensive menu. It's kind of overwhelming when its your first time.  Our server understood our dilemma  and didn't rush us.  

Crab wontons where very good but the sauce had to much of a vinegar taste for my liking.

I had the vegie melt and it was awesome along with sweet potato fries.

Husband had the factory fav burger which was not very good. The french sourdough bread was very hard like it was either old or had once been frozen.

Pick what you order carefully if you want fresh ingredients because with a menu this large, not even half can be made fresh.  

Cheesecake menu is extensive as well. I had the banana cream and hubby had the Reeces one and boy are they good.  Expensive (9$ a slice) but good.

We will go back just not anytime soon. We have to save up to spend 60$ for 2 people for lunch. :("}
{"text":"Came here for dessert. Sat outside on a beautiful September evening. My friend and I didn't feel like drinking so we split the AMAZING chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake al a mode. Holy smokes was it good. Even though we just split one cheesecake slice, our waiter was so attentive and fun. I know I'd be annoyed if we showed up and just split one dessert as a waitress!! Always a fun place, little over priced for meals, but a fun atmosphere. Fun with a group!"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off.  It's the cheesecake factory in superstition Springs in Mesa Arizona ....I attached a picture of their \"margarita\" without the ice, that I was trying to enjoy on Cinco de Mayo.... $9.50 for this???  

It is barely more than a shot IN TOTAL!!!!, it's all ice.  I would be embarrassed to present this to a customer. And the manager came over and tried to sell me on how great it was!!  Pathetic!!  

I would also fire the server.  She had no idea what kind of tequila was in the Margarito...... had no idea what it cost.... typical Gen X, Gen Y,  millennial..... untrained....unskilled .....unmotivated..... uneducated. 

I also attached the receipt from where I went afterwards ....you'll note the cost.... $3.70 and it had twice the volume of margarita. 

I'll never go to another Cheesecake Factory, and I would recommend you stay away from it also. There are so many other better options here in the valley."}
{"text":"After waiting for the initial buzz to settle down about The Cheesecake Factory, I decided to go!  I've been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory for a while and made sure to go whenever in the USA. I lined up about 5 minutes after it opened and still had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. The restaurant was quite empty though so I wasn't sure why there was still such a long wait. The best part of the meal was by far the brown bread!!!  I have a food allergy so the waitress and I had to work really hard to find something I could eat (there was dairy in everything). Overall, the meal was pretty good though. The portion size of the Greek salad is tiny. I also asked the waitress to pack up my chicken fingers and celery but I got home and the celery wasn't in the box which was sad"}
{"text":"Finally after a long wait we made it here! I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Buffalo multiple times so I had high standards for my meal.

In order to get seated at this restaurant you need to be strategic. We arrived at Yorkdale at around 3:20 and immediately we joined the line for a pager. The line was past the Victoria secret entrance and we waited there for thirty minutes. Then they transfer you to another line that is high in security so no one can bud the line which probably took another 5 minutes. So by this point it was basically four. They were fresh out of pagers so they entered our names in the system and said to come back in an hour for the pager. So we got to walk around and do some shopping. When we came back at five we got a pager and had to wait about 25 more minutes before the buzzer went off. By this time it was like 5:30 (I told you it was perfectly planned).

The service here was phenomenal we had a great waitress named Lani and she was very receptive she always made sure we had bread. At one point I started to feel cold and put my jacket around my shoulders she popped by and asked if I wanted some hot water. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer they are pricey but I would say could be easily eaten as a meal if your not super hungry. The wraps were really fresh and delicious. I would say a perfect replica of the buffalo factory. When we finished we waited quite a while for our food but again our amazingly receptive waitress noticed and pushed our order in again and it came within ten minutes. I ordered the Cajun chicken little S and it was probably enough food to feed three small children. Needless to say I couldn't finish it all. It came with a mountain of chicken some corn succotash and mashed potatoes with two different dipping sauces. My boyfriend ordered the factory burrito and again was a meal he couldn't finish. We also ordered a slice of cheesecake to go home. Everything was super delicious and affordable! The meal came up to $69 or so (without tip) for two of us to share an app and dessert with mains we couldn't even finish. 

It was a great night with great service. If your planning to come here you really need to make a date out of it."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks. Great service. Generous portions. Even though it was a Friday night service was great she was an awesome waitress."}
{"text":"I've always liked the food here. The cheesecake is very good so many different choices I always get the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. It's heavenly! Sometimes the service is a little slow but I don't care as much the restaurant is huge and so much to look at. Cool decor nothing like it around. Food I've really liked from here: hot spinach dip, chicken bellagio, Mac and cheese cheeseburger, Santa Fe salad with chicken and ranch dressing. And the bread and butter is great tastes so fresh and good. Drinks are a bit expensive but it is what it is. Not the best place if you are on a diet. Portions are big but awesome because you can get two meals out of it usually. Most servers I've had are super nice great personality and the host was very helpful."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review, because I do really love the food. That's what keeps us coming back - though I think we are finally giving up on it. The service is just awful. I came here with a group of girlfriends for a birthday celebration and the entire night was essentially ruined based on bad service. Everything took forever, our orders were messed up, our drinks were consistently empty, and it just took forever. The hosts weren't friendly, our server was overwhelmed - it just makes for a really unpleasant experience, especially when you're trying to celebrate a birthday. To further my complaints about their service - I wrote a message to their \"contact us\" portion of their website and detailed our experience over a week ago, and never heard back. Unacceptable service."}
{"text":"It is undeniable that this is a popular and trendy chain of restaurant. The design is the same every where. Customer service has been great for me so far.

The food: Warning! Huge portion!! I always have to take half if not even more ham half packed to go and have food coma later. I would say you will definitely get the money worth with the portion even though it is a little bit more pricey. They offer a wide variety of cuisine and food but everything is average. If only they focused on one cuisine and made it really good. 

The cheesecake: Very big as well! And they have the most variety I have ever seen. 90% of the cheesecake that I tried here have been very good. It is, though, very chocolaty, creamy, fatty, cheesy, etc. In short, you get a tons of rich flavor in one bite. 

Side note but I really love the brown bread they have before the entree. And good news is it is free so of course I always order more of that :P"}
{"text":"You just can never go wrong with their chicken picatta and their red velvet cheesecake. It's all I go there for. Their lunch selection is also a good selection as well."}
{"text":"We finally had the chance to go out last night and decided to come to Cheesecake Factory, as it is one of our favorite restaurants.  We decided to go to the bar area to sit because we wanted to get some happy hour drinks and apps along with our dinner.  ALL of the tables were dirty.  The one that we sat at that was set was even dirty.  I used one of the napkins to wipe the table off myself.  The waiter came and took our drink and appetizer order.  He brought us our drinks and then we never saw him again.  I had asked him for a straw which he never brought.  We tried grabbing his attention several times and he just ignored us.  Another person came to bring us our food, and we asked her for a straw and she immediately brought us one.  We were done eating and just decided we wanted to go because the service was so horrible.  No one came to check up on us to see if our food was okay, or if we needed anything.  Other customers were complaining by us as well, which made things even worse.  We happened to snag who we thought was a manager and asked for our check.  We said we had tried getting our servers attention several times, but he wasn't apologetic at all.  About 10 minutes later the waiter finally just laid the check on the table and walked away. Didn't say anything to us.  It just makes me upset when I see servers just sitting in the back areas goofing off with each other and ignoring their customers.  It really ruined our very rare dinner that we had together and we are going to think twice next time we go out to eat.  We have always loved going to cheesecake factory, but after this visit, it seems like things are going downhill for the restaurant and it's very sad.  I wish that I could have tipped the girl who brought our food out because she did more than anyone else in this restaurant did.  Our dining experience shouldn't have taken almost 2 hours, especially with no service or drink refills."}
{"text":"Place: Located by the mall, literally. The venue here is spacious and large. They have outdoor seating for dining, and outdoor seating for awaiting tables. It's wonderful actually. I am always fascinated with the pastel and sky painting, with a splash of regal columns (you find this at every Cheesecake Factories).

Service: Waiters/waitress, on a busy day - they are not at their best. I tend to have my drinks not refilled right away. There is ALWAYS a wait, around 15-45 mins on a busy night. I honestly avoid this place, because of the long wait.  Lunch time is the time to go, at best.

Food: There is an eclectic food selections that are diverse. There are pizza, Italian and Asian cuisines, plethora of cheesecakes to choose from, burgers and sandwiches...

- I liked their iceberg lettuce salad
- their strawberry shortcake dessert is delicious with vanilla ice cream!
- raspberry ice tea, always refreshing
- shrimp scampi, safe, but good in large portions
- chicken Parmesan, always a winner with my hubby

Price: pricey. I believe it is worth it, in terms of big portions.. Enough for little ole me to take home as leftovers for work."}
{"text":"I love this place but today was really off we sat at the bar for a late lunch and it felt as if we were a burden to the bartender. Order a couple burgers and  appetizers that took more than 40 minutes to  make it to our table. I'm really hoping this is just an off day for this venue being there is such close competition in the area tacos, sushi, pizza, the list goes on forever.  

FYI the sushi place on the opposite end of the shopping center has never let us down maybe thinking twice about coming back here."}
{"text":"Love this location, WILL NOT use Postmates for food delivery from CF. Our desserts mysteriously disappeared. Not the CF fault but they need not to partner with Postmates. Our 2nd time and items were missing."}
{"text":"Food is always great.   Never disappointed     
The Louisiana pasta with the Parmesan chicken is my favorite but with the penne instead of the bow tie.   They never complain or upcharge.    

A couple of times I wanted it but could get there so I used door dash to deliver.  Great partnership.  Love it.  
Always coming back to that fantastic place."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chains. I really enjoy the dessert. The service is always very nice. One takeaway is that this establishment is always busy so try to make reservations. The atmospheres inviting and the decor is very stylish."}
{"text":"It's been a few weeks since I brought he kids to our go to place Cheescake factory and I was deeply disappointed with the service that we received. I had asked for bread numerous times and 15 mins later there is no bread. Our appetizers came and ordered a second batch of appetizers and yet still no bread. I know that it's busy but at least have someone come to our table and explain why there is no bread coming. We'll see how this will end tonight."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain restaurant. I have yet to have a bad meal here. The food & the service always stays consistent. I think you get your money's worth since I can never finish my whole meal. My favorite dish is the Chicken Katsu, the chicken is juicy & crispy. My second favorite dish is the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, perfect dish if you want something light. 

I prefer this location over the one in Legacy Village because the wait time isn't as long. During the weekend at the one in Legacy, I've wait anywhere from 1 hour to 1 hour & 30 mins which is insane."}
{"text":"Went to the South Park location yesterday there was a 45 min wait which is so frustrating cause we thought the later we went the less of a wait we would have. Once we finally where seated our server Tavaris was a pleasure he gave us good serves and always came back to make sure our party was taken care of. I was upset that most of the cheesecake was sold out but Tavaris let us know that the shipment had not came in yet. But over all we enjoyed the food and will return"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic dining place for any sized group. The menu is gigantic, the food quality is superb, the atmosphere is fun and fancy, the service is phenomenal, and the location is easy to find: South Park Mall. The interior is spacious, and there's a separate section where you can purchase cheesecakes to-go and other sauces/ingredients and even beanie babies (if I remember correctly)."}
{"text":"Interesting meal with my family. First the appetizer was not prepared properly, out of the lemon chicken and then vegetables were cold. Overall should be zero stars. Made a comment on corporate site and next thing I know, the manager that was so crappy is stalking my linked in page. So if you make a complaint expect the managers to look you up. Little cyber stalking to go with crappy meal."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot. The layout is amazing and the staff was polite. The food was fresh and fun. The Hot Chocolate my son got was great, but my pasta meal blew it away. The Stuffed Garlic mushrooms are OK, but still priced well at right below $7. 

The Cheesecake we got for the ride home, didn't make it far. As always in Charlotte great diverse Staff and Customers...both important"}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, but I'm hoping the management will see it and make some improvements. 

I know it's the first week being open, but come on. I've been to The Cheesecake Factory in Vegas and lineups can be crazy there, too. But they managed things much better in Vegas. 

My experience was for takeout. I called in my order at around 11:45am. The person I spoke to said my food would be ready in half an hour. 

I knew it was going to be busy, but the website stated they had designated parking for takeout orders and you could call when you arrive to see if your food is ready. It even says they'll bring your food out to your car (not true). I called the number when I arrived at the restaurant and they said it wasn't ready but they were working on it. When I asked how long it would take, she hung up on me.

To avoid the nightmare of parking, I stopped in the parking lot and my friend got out to pick up the food. 

I waited ten minutes and called the curbside pickup line again. No answer this time. I called twice more with no luck. I finally got a parking spot and went inside. I was immediately blocked by an employee who told me to get in line. Look, I understand it's busy, but employees should ask \"how can I help you?\" Instead of, \"you need to get in line\". I told her I was meeting my friend who was already in line so she let me in. There were lines EVERYWHERE. You basically had to line up to get in another line. When I found my friend, she was in the mall side in a very long line with four or five people in front of her. There were bags and bags of food lined up for people to pick up. 

I thought it would be about five more minutes to get our food, but no. We waited another 20 minutes, because this line was for both people ordering takeout as well as picking up. I've never waited so long to pick up my food from any restaurant. When I finally got to the front, they confirmed my order by checking every item in the bag. Perhaps they've had a few mixups in the past, so it was good they verified everything. However, it was 12:48pm at that time. A full hour after I ordered and more than half an hour waiting in line, the whole time my food was sitting there. Of course, the food was cold by the time we finally got to eat it. I nuked mine, but some things just don't taste as good when you do that. We shared the egg roll sampler, chicken quesadilla and zucchini sticks and another friend had a chicken pasta lunch special (don't recall the name). 

They really need to get things sorted out. One line to order takeout, and one line to pay/pick up your food that you already ordered. Simple. The food was fine, but would've been so much better when it was hot (or at least warm enough that it didn't require reheating)

I'll go back in the new year after the hype has died down a bit, and update my review."}
{"text":"Come on guys. I ordered a salad to go...minus a couple ingredients and what do they do? Separate half the ingredients in one container, mix the ingredients I didn't want in with the salad in another container and....what was the point. And I tipped the take out cashier. Give me a break. The end of a longgg day, paid a premium for a salad that you can't even get right. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Dynamite shrimp was pretty good. Spinach artichoke dip was decent. Overall, it's simply the Cheesecake Factory. You're not going there for A+ authentic food. You're going there because you're at the mall and hungry and this restaurant has literally the largest menu I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Casual dining is going away and so is my love for Cheesecake.

The food seems to be oversauced and over-condimented. Lettuce in salads never has that crispness and freshness I expect. Jambalaya and Gumbo are great, so are the sandwiches, but there are always waits and service is too scripted. Used to be a fan of the BBQ Chicken Salad, but it's faded out of glory. 

Oh and save room for a Cheesecake."}
{"text":"Visited this afternoon for my birthday lunch because I LOVE cheesecake. We were seated right away which was nice. After sitting for about 15 minutes and giving our orders I actually had to stop our waitress and ask for some bread and sweetener for my boyfriends tea. That was a little annoying but oh well right? I order two appetizers the sliders and the loaded potato puffs to share with my 1 year old and explain not to bring them out as an appetizer but with my boyfriends entree which was to be a burger and fries. Guess what? Got my appetizers early and my half got cold as I waited for his meal to appear, when it did appear we were told they were waiting on his fries and they would be right out, they never came and instead of following up our waitress walks by,sees he is done with his burger and asks if he would like her to take his plate. In the end the manager took his meal off the check but needless to say I did not stay for my cheesecake nor will I ever return to this joke of a restaurant. I know its not the worst experience but its your job at least put some effort in."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it was VERY SALTY. All I tasted was salt. I had to send it back after 2 bites! Very disappointing. It's the simplest dish. Our server was very friendly and had a great attitude so not a total loss."}
{"text":"The only time I come here is for happy hour and it's always amazing! It's from 4-6 and most of the appetizers are $5 or a little more. The bartenders are friendly, very attentive, and great at multitasking."}
{"text":"I had the crab bites and they were okay, nothing too impressive and I had the loaded baked potato soup which was really bad. My girlfriend had a cucumber mojito and it had too much mint and the mint leaves were going bad. Same thing with the green leaves in the salads. The two people I was with ordered different salads. Both were crap. Someone ordered a burger and that was apparently good but the person that said that doesn't have very high standards for burgers. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Huge menu with many choices.  The problem is that portions, while large, are sparse on important contents.  Salads are mostly lettuce and other inexpensive ingredients and prices are high.  This place used to be better."}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birthday  and there was about 25 of us we tried to make reservations they said that they can not make them for Friday nights at 7 pm but the manager said he will do his best to make sure we are seated ASAP. Most of the people got there at 630 and we had a table and everyone seated at 7. We sat on the patio and had one waitress who would some times get help from another waiter. They both went above and beyond to make sure that the whole group was happy.  We all got our drinks at the same time and all got food with in minutes of one another. (Most of the time in big groups someone doesn't get their food for about 15 min after everyone has already got theirs) they had a great staff who knew the menu and had wonderful recommendations. I always like asking he waitress what her favorite drink is and trying it same with the food. She did not disappoint. Between 25 of us there was not one complaint and the birthday girl was extremely happy. All in all it was a great experience I have been to this location many times and have always had good service but it is mostly just a date night or couples date night. Never this big of a group ant they really impressed me.  

Sorry this took so long to post we went there on August 26th. Friday at 7 pm."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place. Always busy in lunch time on weekends, but I never wait more than 15 minutes. The service is excellent and always fast even in busy days. Don't forget to try chicken bellagio, it's the best."}
{"text":"We've been here on multiple occasions; whether it's for a few drinks at the bar, a quiet dinner, or a birthday dinner for a party of 50. They always seem to accommodate. Although I'd love it if they took reservations, they always get us in. Expect to wait to be seated at least 30 minutes on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Nice people buy slow service and got the food wrong. We had ro run out to put more quarters in the parking meter."}
{"text":"While I can understand a busy night, I can't understand when I spend 100 dollars just on drinks and am waiting 45 minutes for chewy pasta.  Both dishes came out way too long under the lamp, all the pasta was chewy and I was to wait longer to remake it?  No thanks. The one bartender was very nice and courteous, but the other  messed up 2 of my drinks and never noticed.  Over all, a poor experience."}
{"text":"Lunch hour! It is great food and service. I will be back soon and have more items for dinner, since it's lunchtime tgif  lol I really  enjoyed my lunch here."}
{"text":"I have been to this location at least 10 times and several other locations about the same amount of times. I've come to expect a certain level of service and experience when I go. The wait is normally long no matter when you go, but on this day, I didn't have to wait for more than 10 minutes. 

The waitress brought us some bread, but it was cold and not a full order. We looked to the table next to us with the same amount of people and they had twice as much as us. We love the bread here and always look forward to it. Even after we finished our bread, we were never asked once if we wanted some more. 

Before we got there, I had it in my head what I wanted, since the menu rarely changes. I have almost all 1,334 pages memorized. Undoubtably, I wanted some of the fried Mac n Cheese balls. Also, knowing that the portions can sometimes be rather large, I decided I wanted the chicken tenders. They say they are Cajun, but as someone who grew up eating Cajun cuisine, nothing about the feels Cajun. I just wanted them because I knew they would bring me a mountain of them. 

Once the food came, I was ready to climb the plate. The chicken tenders came with succotash and an order of mashed potatoes. Everything was just as good as it's been in the past. Also, when I say they bring you a mountain of food, be prepared to have plenty left over for the next day (or so). 

My wife and I split the lemon raspberry cheesecake (had no clue they even had this) and it was amazing. It's now my favorite cheesecake flavor. I can't wait to have it again

My only real complaint was the service. As I stated, I always expect a certain level of service when I go to Cheesecake Factory and during this visit, I'd rank it at the bottom. I had to flag our waitress down on multiple occasions. I never felt like she cared about us and she never once checked in to see how we were doing. Other than that, my experience was still a good one."}
{"text":"Great service, place is very nice and clean. Food was good and server was attentive. We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I forgot how big the portions are at this establishment lol it makes sense since the dishes can be a tad bit pricey. I have the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was okay nothing mind blowing ,kinda don't understand what makes it Louisiana ,but it was good either way. The salads look amazing here! The service here was great our waiter was very nice. I was here for a dinner party so there were about 30 of us and the staff handled it very well. The variety of foods to choose from was huge but that's what the cheese cake factory is known for. But to wrap it up I was impressed with the staff and I enjoyed my dinner. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Back again... Went to the Henderson location on Valentine's day and service took 15 minutes to get our waters and here we are again at the downtown location and it took 7 minutes for them to get back with us after seating so it's a little better."}
{"text":"I love I mean love their cheesecake! Craig's carrot cheesecake is definitely my favorite but the time before last I went and got the Craig's carrot cake cheesecake and it was 90 percent carrot cake so this time I just wanted the cheesecake... I ordered the original cheesecake and from the get go the employees acted like I was bothering them.... Not a good welcome! Anyway I take the original cheesecake home and try to eat it.... Super mushy and the top was half cream cheese.... Now I could have gotten a firmer better tasting cheesecake from Jack in the box or Carl's jr.... I was highly disappointed with this trip to the cheesecake factory! I will give them another try but it will be a while when I spend almost $8 for a slice and I'm unbappy"}
{"text":"As a restaurant chain, The Cheesecake Factory offers delicious but oversized plates.  After any Cheesecake Factory meal, you should expect to be content with your food along with a full stomach and leftovers.  The staff at this particular location are friendly and attentive.  I'd give this place 5 stars if they decreased the portion size and lowered the price accordingly."}
{"text":"go for happy hour!  Full size app portions for less than 1/2 off. Assorted cocktails and specific wines also reduced.  Was pleasantly surprised by quality of the food as well."}
{"text":"The kitchen was backed up....not a big deal except we couldn't get bread or drinks and when we did get drinks and bread we couldn't get refills on either. Our server passed by us several times.....the steak (for the first time ever) was overcooked. In 10+ years of ordering rib eyes at Cheesecake Factory. Then when our food was packaged we didn't get sauces. Simply not the level of excellence we are used to. 

Really disappointed."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory hardly disappoints, with their huge menu offering just about anything for the variety of palates. 

I had the skinny-luscious steak medallions and they were tasty but surely small. Of course I knew I was ordering off the skinny-Lucius menu but it was quite a surprise to see how small they were. I made the mistake of ordering them medium - since they're so small they came back cooked pretty medium well (my bad). 

The cucumber lemonade is where it's at! They muddle fresh lime in it and it's absolutely delicious!!! Our server Marcella couldn't hear us though. And she brought chocolate milk out for my kid even though I distinctly said white. She tried, however- it seemed."}
{"text":"Let me tell you. I use to ignore this place cause if the long lines in Waikiki. But, this has changed after this visit here in Vegas. The Food was exquisite and fresh. Tasty, moist and tender. I had the Carne Asada Beef steak with Mash potato. It was a bit over spicy for me but it was flavored well. Annnnnnnnd the Cheese Cake me u list is about a mile long. So we tried a whole bunch of it and got comatose of sugar galore but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 31/100

Yes, in a city full of amazing bars, local eats, and world famous restaurants--- I chose the Cheesecake Factory as our spot to enjoy a Saturday night dinner.  Why??? Well, I know exactly what to expect when I come here.  And that's EXACTLY why the Cheesecake Factory hit the spot.

This restaurant was very similar to every other Cheesecake Factory I've visited in the past. It was tastefully decorated, extremely busy, and very noisy.  Our server was on top of her game and was extremely attentive and friendly. The food was tasty and the portions were HUGE! We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go, which was fantastic.

As chain restaurants go, I think Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. As long as I still eat cheesecake, I will be returning (especially for their Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake)."}
{"text":"The service was spotty.   We were sat and waited 15 minutes before a hostess was flagged by me.  Then the mgr came and offered apologies and free dessert to each of us.  The food was very good.  The fried catfish was a hit and the tuscan chicken was just in need of a little salt.  The chocolate cakes were delish and the lemon cello"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Factory Meatloaf. I usually do not care for gravy, but the roux on this meatloaf made a good sauce forthr meat.  The side of corn with red and green peppers with zucchini cut into it was a nice flavor mash up."}
{"text":"We went here because we had family in town & they were staying at Caesars Palace & wanted to eat here. It's nice & big but because it's on the strip in the forum shops, the wait to get seated is kind of long. They have to call us on our cellphone to let us know when seating is available.

When you get inside, it feels kind of cramped. It took a longer time then normal to get our orders taken. The have a big menu. So much to choose from. They even have a menu for people watching their calories.  

For refreshments, I had the strawberry lemonade. It was super tangy. Very strong flavor. I'm not sure if it's just me because I'm pregnant & my taste buds are more sensitive or it really is just super sour.

It took a long time to get our food & honestly it wasn't very satisfying. Our appetizers were ok. I had the eggplant Parmesan & it was bland but the linguini noodles was super salty. I couldn't finish my meal. The only thing I like about Cheesecake Factory is their cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Wait time wasn't too bad and all the staff was very friendly. The restaurant was very clean and looks great. 
Food was very delicious and the portion sizes were huge. They even have a 'skinny' menu with a lot of options. Make sure you save room for the amazing cheesecake. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Never ever go near this restaurant, rude service, rude waitress and food cold , with idiots for employees"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this chain!  I have never had a bad meal.  I love the chicken and biscuits,  as well as a grilled chicken dish with asparagus and mushrooms.  The red velvet cheesecake is my all time favorite.  Be prepared to wait, even with a reservation."}
{"text":"Good food, busy restaurant, not quiet. 

Servers are always attentive and knowledgable. The menu has a huge selection. Almost too huge! Food is always great. Portions are big and I usually have leftovers for the next day's lunch.

Sometimes it can be quite noisy and tough to have a conversation. There are so many tables next to each other that noise can really travel.

This is one of my wife's favorite places and I always get in trouble if I go without her."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve and took my daughter out for lunch and some shopping at Crocker Park, ended up at Cheesecake Factory....No wait, but fairly crowded inside...When I visit any CF I always order the Thai Lettuce Wraps as a starter, basically it's chicken satay, with 8-10 pieces of bibb lettuce, accompanied with chopped cucumbers, shaved carrots, cilantro,   Thai noodles and 3 sauces (all 3 are excellent) - Thai Chili Sauce, Peanut Sauce and a Tamarind Sauce, trust me when you construct that 1st wrap  try 1 or all 3 on your creation - you won't be sorry.....Daughter and I enjoyed the wraps - they never disappoint....For our lunch I ordered a Fried Chicken sandwich on a Brioche Bun, with a side on Buffalo Sauce and Fries, my daughter order a Pasta Evelyn dish which is rigatoni pasta with pesto sauce, roasted red peppers, pine nuts, broccoli and shallots.....The sandwich came with lettuce and tomato and slice of pepper jack cheese and blue cheese dressing....definitely recommend it, big piece of chicken that was cooked perfectly accompanied by buffalo sauce and blue cheese (it's a winner)...My daughter's pasta looked good, she said it was too much for her so she boxed it up for later.....we both agreed that we would split a piece of cheesecake (duh), we order a lemon meringue cheesecake...presentation was pretty....cheesecake was a bit dry, but taste was good.....I like CF's, I usually get a good meal and walk away full and satisfied, the CF at Crocker Park fit the bill as my daughter and I enjoyed our Christmas Eve lunch...."}
{"text":"Natürlich mussten wir im Rahmen unserer USA Reise auch unbedingt einmal die Cheesecake- Factory besuchen. Es ist wirklich Wahnsinn- der Name hält, was er verspricht: Cheesecake in rauen Mengen und allen nur erdenklichen Variationen! Man sollte den Cheesecake aber besser als Hauptspeise und weniger als Dessert bewerten. Ansonsten könnte man Gefahr laufen, dass man einfach platzt. Die Portionen sind ordentlich und der Kuchen selbst wird mit einem dicken Schlag Sahne serviert. Diese braucht man aber eigentlich gar nicht- der Kuchen selbst ist saftig genug. Service und Location waren auch in Ordnung- Parkplätze ausreichend vorhanden."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place. But the service was TERRIBLE. The woman was so slow and put her FINGER in my food!!!! I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to eat dinner tonight with my best friend and son, always have a good experience. Food is awesome! Only downfall tonight was waiter took a little long to take our order, and the lights went out while we were eating. We were really dying for desert after our meal and it was a real bummer the lights went out so we got the check and left! 

Other than that food was great!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to have salads. They are huge and have a variety of different kinds of salads. It never seems like it's been soaking in dressing. Taste really fresh. Also, to top it off, you can have delicious cheesecake. Easily the best cheesecake in town. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had a family lunch on Thursday and it has been a pleasant experience. We were three of us, and asked to be seated on a booth. They promptly escorted us to a booth of six, without knowing that we intended spending a lot of money there.
We ordered avocado egg rolls, two Tuscan Asparagus chicken from skinny DELICIOUS menu, Americana Cheeseburger, strawberry smoothie, Mojito Pineapple, and ultimately the Tiramisu Cake!
I don't know which meal was better than the other!
Definitely, the Tuscan chicken was succulent and tasty, my mojito was amazing, strawberry smoothie very well done, and tiramisu like I was in Italy.
Definitely we will come back next week!
Thanks for your service and strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"Took a nice 45 minute drive to get here and wished we went somewhere else. We were seated right away (430pm so start of diner rush). Our server didn't show up for 10 minutes even though she passed our table several times without greeting us. Her affect and demeanor was flat and that persisted throughout our meal.  I wanted to say put a smile on that face!  My Wife ordered almond crusted salmon salad and it arrived without Brussels sprouts, quinoa, or arugula.  Just a big pile of kale and salmon.  We asked about it and she went and grabbed a menu to read what was supposed to come on the salad. It's like cmon we know what we ordered.  So she took the salad and came back with a question: do we want a new salad or just through the missing ingredients on the old one?? Are you kidding me??  I hate sending food back for fear of what they'll do to it but she couldn't eat that salad.  New one please. 
My chicken wings were overpriced and undercooked.  $13 for 8 wings?? Of course on the menu they don't tell you how many you get so I assumed it was a dozen. Wrong.  Also the drink menu doesn't have prices either.  
The ahi tuna appetizer was good and the Korean fried cauliflower was awesome.  They did comp us a slice of cheesecake for the salad mistake.  Oh and the floors were greasy and slippery. I almost fell when leaving.  
Overall not a great experience for the price.  The waitress just didn't have the personality for this line of work.  And personality goes a long way especially when there's problems with what's being served.  We left a big tip on the gift card (that I bought) only because we're not coming back here again.  Just not worth the price or drive."}
{"text":"\"Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney\" - Drake

My roomie likes two things: Drake and Cheesecake Factory. And she had gotten a particular Drake song in her head and asked if I could take her to Cheesecake Factort. It was her birthday after all. 

This Cheesecake Factory is located in the Boca Park shopping center in Summerlin. Not hard to find as it is probably one of their anchor stores for that shopping center.

Maybe it's the location [you are in Summerlin afterall] but this location seems more elegant and dressed up than your average Cheesecake Factory. Parking can be a hassle but there are valets outside.

Anyways, on to why this is a 4 star rating.

My girlfriend and I took my roommate to dinner for her birthday yesterday. As soon as we entered the girlie and I took a seat while my roomie gave the group's name to the hostess. We had sat down and were called almost immediately! Talk about service. 

Our server was a very nice woman named Cathy B. who was very attentive. I'm HUGE on customer service and recognize it whenever I see stellar service. She was a sweet, kept our drinks filled, took our plates away as soon as we were done eating and we were even able to get her and the rests of the servers to come over and sing 'happy birthday' to the B-day girl. 

The total experience was excellent and left an impression on me. And that's a big plus because I'm generally not a fan of chain restaurants like C.F. or Olive Garden.

Now on to the food.

For an appetizer I had an order of buffalo chicken wings. They were yummy and had the right amount of zing to them. The best thing I had that night!

For dinner I ordered the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It was cooked to order and even had pork belly in it. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Pretty average. And the only reason I can't give my visit a perfect rating. 

I did have a bite of the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and it was good. I don't have much in terms of a sweet tooth so I can't say that the cheesecake wow'ed me but it did was plated very beautifully. Nice job on the presentation."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned Hamburger was nice and juicy. The Original Cheesecake was delicious as always. Service was fast and attentive. Will come back again if in need of a cheesecake fix."}
{"text":"My Lunch is fabulous. Strawberry Lemonade and a Tuna salad. I'm set for the rest of the Day. Great service."}
{"text":"Next to free Atlantis show in Caesars Palace - we were told that we could see the show from our table \"outside\" the main Cheesecake factory, BUT it did NOT show on the video monitors as we were told - it was on the other side of the Atlantis \"aquarium\" so we could only hear the noise and see some flames coming out of the display - this would have been disappointing for children but it was no big deal to us 3 adult women.

The food was delicious as usual for a Cheesecake factory.  Our server seemed to be having a bad day and she was tired, but I guess she did her best."}
{"text":"Service was slow, so slow the guys next to us asked to have part of their meal comp'd. We stuck through it bc we love the cheesecake factory food. My shepherd's pie was great. Tasty and hearty on a cold day. My bf's burger also was satisfying. I was tempted to get my cheesecake before the food but wrestled my inner 10-year-old in favor of getting cherry cheesecake after my food. It was amazing. It made the sucky service worth it."}
{"text":"We went for brunch. Kids menu are decent sized portions. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles with egg Benedict. It was cooked properly. But the flavor wasn't my thing. First time I ate fried chicken waffles and egg Benedict. My husband ordered the custom omelette . He loved it. We ordered cheesecake to go because we were stuffed. 

There was no line for a buzzer when the mall opened at 930am. We were seated at our table at 10am when the restaurant opened."}
{"text":"Ate with the family here recently. We brought along some family friends as well so had a total of 4 children in kid seats and they accommodated us very well. We ended up order the miso salmon, fish and chips, and bbq chicken salad. The waitress was awesome as during our wait she brought out banana and bread plates for all the kids to enjoy (also to keep them quiet I think haha). The fish and chips were delicious, cooked perfectly and crispy. The bbq chicken salad was delicious as well. Our friend commented that the miso salmon was to \"die for,\" I'll take that as a compliment. The portion size was also generous. Overall, I would definitely return to the Cheesecake Factory with my family."}
{"text":"TLDR: expansive menu + kids', long waits, standard service, inside/outside seating

This California-based company prides itself on continuing Oscar's and Evelyn's dream of providing excellent cheesecakes and desserts in a bakery setting. I'm not so sure that this is reflected in today's restaurants, started by their son, David. 

My family decided that we would venture into the not-so-upscale Fashion Village at Boca Park. Because Cheesecake Factory boasts an expansive menu, even for the kiddos, I guess I wouldn't mind holding our spot in line for our large party. A promised 45-minute wait, although expected at peak dining hours on a Saturday night, was cut down to about 25 minutes: an unexpected, but welcome, plus! The host stand seemed filled with unnerving hostesses as well as the hustle and bustle of seating all the walk-up guests. They probably needed a break and a reminder that every new customer deserves a positive experience. 

Upon seating, I was immediately greeted my by waitress. Her smile appeared genuine and her customer service rhetoric was unwavering excellent. I was impressed. A secondary server/busser provided bread and waters for all the guests without question. It was fantastic. Our waitress was very accommodating, making suggestions, attentively listening to our requests/restrictions, and tending to the needs of the young children at the table. Upon everyone's food delivery, a manager approached my table to discuss the reason as to why my salmon salad wasn't delivered yet. He stated a vague, yet wordsmithed response in which he basically stalled for an additional 7 minutes. The \"fish just wasn't right\" probably meant that it wasn't cooked yet, it fell on the floor, they forgot, or any combination of two. A specific, yet honest answer would have been more appreciated. Isn't honesty the best policy?

Although the selected dishes varied, I will comment on what I tasted during my experience. My salmon salad for $17.95 was delicious. An herb-crusted salmon topped field greens, cut tomatoes, endive, and asparagus paired nicely with my glass of iced green tea (suggest simple syrup from the bar to accompany the drink). The salmon looked at least 8oz and did not overpower the dish. I recommend the ranch in lieu of the vinaigrette. The children's pepperoni pizza can be a little spicy for children, so be wary of your picky eaters. The tostada salad is a mouth-watering heaping mound of greens atop chicken and a tostada. The lettuce wasn't dried/spun prior to plating and, therefore, left an unnecessary pool of water on the plate and tostada (which transformed into a soft taco shell). The meatloaf is average: nothing special and nothing exciting. Save yourself and select an alternative dish. For dessert, the limoncello cream torte was to die for. Layers of vanilla cake christened with lemon marscopone allows for a sweet dish worthy in lieu of any dessert wine. 

As we received the check, our desserts were double charged, a strike two for our experience. With the tardiness in food delivery, accuracy of order, and initial experience, I rate it 3/3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Ate with the family and it was really good. I ended up having the fish and chips. The fish was extremely moist and the fries were fried well. The bread they provide up front for appetizer was delicious, warm, and fresh. The kids really enjoyed the food and the service was nice/friendly. Overall, I'll definitely be coming back especially given the kid friendly nature of the restaurant. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"This used to be a really good place to come but the past 3 times I've come here it's been horrible. Just left the place right now because I waited 15 minutes for someone to take my order and no one came. The place was not busy at all. The last time I was here they brought out our appetizers with our entree's and the food was all cold and didn't look good at all. I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory but not this location. They could care less about their customers. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Delicious!

Busy, as always.  The server was present--but not.  I think they need more help.  Manager, stop being cheap!

The food was good.  Cheesecake Factory; it's what I expect."}
{"text":"I generally avoid chain restaurants, but I was on the westside of the Valley and my friend suggested The Cheesecake Factory. Considering the fact that all of the salads on the menu were with Romaine lettuce (and the outbreak of ecoli was still in the news), I opted for the chicken enchilladas. They were the worst I have ever had. The tortillas were rubbery, so I just ate the filling which was not so tasty and the chicken was dry. Fortunately, there  was complimentary bread and butter. I must add that the server was very pleasant. I am guessing that everyone goes there for the cheesecake and not the entres."}
{"text":"Took forever to get our food. My huevos ranchero tasted like it had been sitting under the lamp for quite a while. Stiff and not very tasty. Our server did apologize and credited our bill for my food. (I only ate a few bites.) Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Food was good, we had the Thai lettuce wraps omg they are so awesome! These are my new favorite thing. We also had a double double cheeseburger and quesadilla with chicken and the Cajun pasta. All dishes were really good, however I will return for those Thai wraps so good. I would give the Thai wraps alone 5 stars. Our server was pretty good and she has a great personality which is rare these days. We will return. The only two things that were bad was the restroom was broken so the line for women's room was long. Plus the seating area in front not of the kitchen is weird since you can see the staff eating right there."}
{"text":"Great place!  Put your name in and browse the shops.  Just make sure to check back because they told us 45 minutes and our table was ready in 20.  The waiter was very nice, warned me against a drink he said, and I quote, \" a waste of $8\" LOL  The food was awesome.  Order the Rasberry Lemon cheesecake...everyone in our party is STILL talking about it a month later."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. The sheer variety- I love. So many things to choose from and so many good things. 

The lovely host that seated us came out with a little snack for our toddler. I thought that was so nice and thoughtful. Maybe they do that all the time. Either way, nice touch.

Food ordered:
Kids pizza- pretty good size for kids size
Chinese Chicken Salad- yum! Huge and tasted great. One of my favorite salads.
Shrimp Bang Bang ( or something like that) pasta.

Service was excellent.

Kind of surprised at the low ratings.

No wait which was nice compared to the one closer to our home which always has a wait no matter the time."}
{"text":"Came here for my son's birthday on Wednesday night. We made a reservation for the 8 of us just in case it was busy and we were able to sit down right away. The server was very helpful and quick. All of our food was delicious as usual-so many choices!! We love the turkey burgers here! The bread is awesome as well. My only complaint is that they don't do free cheesecake on your birthday. I realize it's $8 but I think they should offer a free dessert like most places."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that a company as large & well known as Cheesecake Factory would allow their restaurants to be Deceitful, Dishonest and Cheat their loyal customers! 

See my posted photo of receipt from my last visit to Cheesecake Factory, Boca Park location.

Though it's only a suggested gratuity, they Deceitfully suggest you tip on the taxed amount.

Almost every other restaurants I visit only suggest tip on actual food & beverages as it's supposed to be.

I usually tip 22 - 25% of amount & sometimes glance at these numbers to help determine my tipping amount.

I noticed this before but now have to speak out because of continued use of this misleading practice.

If this happens to you Yelpers at other Cheesecake locations, please post a review to warn others of the Dishonest Billing practice being used by Cheesecake Factory!

5 Stars for Food
4.5 Stars for Service
\"0\" Stars for Billing Practice"}
{"text":"I've been here for a few different occasions...and overall I feel like three stars is just about right. I went here recently with a group of girlfriends and they seated us in the middle of a bunch of booths at a huge round table...a little uncomfortable but workable...I don't particularly care for their food, but expect to pay about $10 for a sangria or a glass of wine.

They are always crowded though, so it must be the overpriced cheesecake that keeps them coming in."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to try this location again (with some friends) even though we know the wait times are usually ridiculous. We were able to get a seat immediately on a Tuesday evening. I had the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and it was amazing! I was so glad I was able to figure out what I wanted since their menu is huge.
The service was excellent. No one had a empty glass all evening. Very courteous and consistent all night long. We will definitely be visiting this location again soon."}
{"text":"Not that I come here very often, but when I do, it's usually pretty good. The menu has changed, although still a bit overwhelming with choice, they have made some strides away from the huge plate, huge calorie (and huge belly) meals to a little more resonable choices. Of course, that 'responsible eating' can go straight out the window with a few bites of one of their delectable cheesecake selections! We had good service and a pleasant waitress, left with a slice of cheesecake and we're happy."}
{"text":"We love this place. The sweet corn tamales or Chicken Belagio are our favorites.
Be prepared to wait for a seat. It's that busy. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was amazing other than the customer service not being so good @ first......... The cheese cake is 8.95 per slice I think that's kind of high. But it is what it is"}
{"text":"So far I've visited Yorkdale's Cheesecake Factory twice and both visits were pretty great. Their selection of specialty dishes and cheesecakes is so large that it is a little overwhelming when it comes to choosing what to eat, especially for someone as indecisive as myself. 

The first time I went, I tried the Chicken Madeira which was recommended by the server and the Tiramisu cheesecake. The Chicken Madeira is supposedly one of the most popular specialty items and it was really good; the chicken was very soft and the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy. The size of the specialty dishes are very large, however they can be a little pricey (the Chicken Madeira costs $26). Although the portions are large, it may not be quite enough for two people. I shared the Chicken Madeira with a friend, however I think we both have a small appetite and we had plenty of bread with our dish. The Tiramisu cheesecake was very nice and light--would recommend!

What's really great about the Cheesecake Factory is its unlimited bread and butter to keep you busy while you wait for your food to arrive. The servers are also pretty good at checking up on you and making sure that you have enough bread and water at all times. The servers I had during both visits were very friendly and attentive. 

Although the wait can be quite long, I'd much rather wait 1-2 hours to be seated at the Cheesecake Factory than dine at Pickle Barrel."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for the national cheesecake date 1/2 special. I've been to various Cheesecake Factory's all over and this one was no different - delicious cheesecake. Despite be very busy due to the promotion, the line moved quickly and efficiently. I'll definitely return for cheesecake."}
{"text":"Absolutely crap service! Took my son and my little sister here for their birthdays with our families. Couldn't get a refill in under 15 minutes. Had to ask them 3 times to do the birthday thing for my son and sister. Then they even mess that up haven't eaten here in years and I remember why. Seriously F--- the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Lots of options of food, drinks and desserts. As a gf, I was happy to see a lot of options for gf. Our whole table ordered tacos, steaks and chicken. Food was decent. I enjoyed it. We even took a little home. Had a California whiskey sour, and it was too sweet. Sent it back for a glass of wine. Ordered a key like cheesecake and a Godiva cheesecake (gf), both we're delectable and so rich."}
{"text":"I usually go the Chandler location. So I am judging this one based on my experiences at the Chandler location. We came to this one, since we were in the area for dr. appointments.  Our server was fine. Drinks and appetizer came quick and were fine. When our meals came was when the problems started. Our server did not bring them. Some random person dropped them off and left. Mom had the dinner sized meatloaf and it was good and a very large portion of meat, potatoes, and veg. Mine was not so good. I had the chicken lettuce wraps. The lettuce was not butter lettuce, but a type of leaf lettuce. The amount of each topping was barely there. A small spoonful of each veg and the noodles. I am used to getting 2-3 times more of each topping. I wanted to complain, but it took our server 10-15 minutes to come check on us after we received our food. I told her the problems, but she did not seem to care. I had not touched it. So we just said to pack it up. She mixed everything together from my wraps and did not include the cabbage that held the toppings, to keep things separate. She put Mom's large dinner in a regular container and piled everything on top of each other. Thank goodness Mom does not mind her food mixed(corn in the potatoes, etc). Then the server put the side of gravy in a to go box and not a lidded container, We had to be careful it did not spill. We ordered cheesecake to go . She brought everything in separate bags. so instead of having one large to go bag we had 4 small bags. Very bulky and not easy to handle. The server was nice enough, just inexperienced. They need to train them better. We never saw a manager, so I could not talk with them. We expected the same quality and quantity of food at the location, that we get at Chandler. We did not receive that. So we will not be coming back to this location. They do not care if you like the food or have a problem. They just want your money."}
{"text":"Two things I learned: 
1. The Cheesecake Factory has prep cooks from 4am-12am every day. Everything they make is made fresh every day. 
2. The Cheesecake Factory is actually somewhat tasty. 

We had a really great server and the food was good and came out fast. Its portions are oversized, absolutely. Like most chains, it is advised to share. 

The cheesecake really is fabulous but I'm not chomping at the bit to return here as it is kind of pricy for  chain food."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as always. Took cheesecake and leftovers home which were still awesome the next day!!"}
{"text":"The good: My favorite appetizer here are the Buffalo Blasts, they taste so good, but are so bad for you. The food was good, as always. I really liked the smores cheesecake we had for dessert. 

The bad: I was here on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Service ran quite a bit slower than normal; we had to ask auxiliary staff for water and bread to tide us over until our food came. Our server seemed overwhelmed, so that made her more short (but not rude) than maybe she usually is. 

I usually get great service at the Cheesecake factory, hopefully things will be better next time."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and overcrowded.Our food was wrong twice and when we got it was lukewarm. The server complained that it wasn't his fault it was the fault of the spanish people working in the back who couldn't speak english (horrible thing to say). Truly  a terrible experience and have had similiar experiences dealing with terrible service at various other cheesecake factories. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"The portions at the Cheesecake Factory are pretty big. We had the pork belly sliders as an appetizer and I was pretty full afterwards and I didn't really need an entree. The pork belly sliders were good; but had too much sauce for my liking-I think it would have really tastes good without all that extra sauce. For my entree I had a 1/2 of my chicken avocado club sandwich which was pretty good-the bacon was crispy and had a nice taste. I was too full for Cheesecake afterwards; but I typically go for the celebration cake. That's a personal fav as it's a little lighter than the other cheesecakes that they have."}
{"text":"Our office orders cheesecake from here regularly. My absolute favorite? The wild blueberry cheesecake with white chocolate. OH MY GOSH! So flavorful, and not too sweet! (and pretty to look at too!) 

You can pretty much always expect a wait on the weekends... but not to fear, they have a very spacious bar (and pages of drinks to choose from). Plus, you can eat pretty much anything here... from Indian/Thai cuisine to Italian to Americano... there is something for everyone. What is a must try? The Chicken and Biscuits... an enormous platter covered in mashed potatoes, a savory chicken/gravy mix covered in huge biscuits. WOW. Creamy chicken with flaky biscuits, you can't go wrong! Also, the Chicken Picatta is my favorite Italian dish-delightfully lemony with just the right amount of capers and tender chicken... delicious!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy Cheesecake Factory. 

This location is tucked in a corner of Caesars palace forum of shops. 

Great extensive menu, portions, lively ambience and great pricing. Love lunch menu portions which are still too large but great value. 

Service always top notch and friendly.

Desserts are what makes this place too. Any cheesecake is delicious. 

Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"We only went here because we got a gift card to go.. Long wait, very un personal customer service. I asked what was good and server wasn't really thrilled that I was asking questions and just said he's give us some time. Well it took forever for him to come back, we ordered and waited. Strawberry lemonade was way too sweet, also for some odd reason we didn't have a bread basket like the other tables...well we got our meals and they looked like they had been just thrown on the plate. The best thing were the mashed potatoes. Salmon was overpowered by the spices, literally had to scrape them off. Had the white chocolate macadanian nut cheesecake, which was amazing. That was the best thing we had all night, I would probably not go if I was the one paying."}
{"text":"Love the Cheesecake Factory, and this visit was no different. About a 20/30 min wait turns into being seated within 10. Sat with Sid as our waiter, and he was spot on. Quick diligent service, and amazing food. Thank you again. Sid should get a raise!!! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"And who doesn't need a trip through the Shoppes at the Forum and an excuse to perhaps catch the statue show?
While I don't get the allure of eating a meal at this chain, I will wait in line for a slice of cheesecake.  I hadn't visited one in a long time so this may be old news but there seemed some new additions to the menu of slice choices.
I chose Craig's Crazy Carrot cake... The clerk threw in two forks- as if I was going to share- not this gal. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is the second time within 2 weeks that I have visited the South side location. Last week our service was poor and we made a point to let someone know. Giving them another chance, we are back today for lunch. Service is still just as bad. It took 10 minutes for us to get water, and even longer for bread after she said she would bring some, we still had to ask after 15 minutes had passed"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory quality maintained! We ordered Fried Zucchini, Fried Mac n Cheese and a Mango Keylime Cheesecake. Hearty meal, good food and service. Will surely be making this a regular."}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere is a lil chaotic with tbe crowd outsude aquarium and statue show but Dave was a great waiter."}
{"text":"Shawn is the best waiter you should definitely request him he made the experience even better"}
{"text":"If wasn't for the manager Don I would be giving this place zero stars if that was possible, my burger was so raw I couldn't eat it, my food came out at least 5minutes after my wife's so there was no point in having them remake it since my wife had already ate half of hers. Our waitress Brittany  H was by far the worse and rudest waitress we have ever had. From throwing our bill on the table to overcharging us then when I asked about it she refused to honor the price and said it was my fault she over charged me. Luckily Don the manager was working because she at least put some positive experience into going there in fixing our bill, apologizing for her waitress, even gave us free desert for our constant troubles."}
{"text":"There's a lot of negative reviews on this place but I personally like it. I've never been disappointed with the food, staff, or service. As many yelpers has said, prices may be a bit higher but that's because the portions are huge. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, menu very diverse, didnt like being taken to back seating area where it appeared they sit all families with children, our server left me a little more to desire by valentina, ordered coke, she gave me diet coke, she said sorry, ordered white rice and was given brown rice, we ate it only for reason because she took ten minutes to check our table once it was served..again she apologized, when she finally checked pur table we advised her of the error and she actually went back to check her written ticket to verify we were telling the truth,  it would have been the perfect visit if she was able to handle the 4 tables she was sat. Not sure yet if i will return, again food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory is like all of the others. Consistent.  That is actually what made McDonalds famous- consistency.  It's very crowded, quite loud, and if you are lucky enough to get a patio seat you will be treated to the Poseidon show complete with smoke, water and flames. 

My husband went with a chicken pasta dish, and I opted for the chicken tostada salad.  Both were good as usual.  The service was excellent, as it should be in a big hospitality based town.   

Is it flash, fancy or different-no, but if you are looking for a quick meal without breaking the bank, then here's your place."}
{"text":"Wow. 
The waiting time 60-90 mins during a slow service time like 5 PM or 9 PM... worse (2 hrs) if it is 6:30. 
All this could be avoided by taking reservations with $50 on a credit card and then getting a credit back when you show up. 
There are other options - especially for a family. 
It is hard when your family (kids) want to eat. 
Very pathetic - not family friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for dinner. Must be just my luck but service is not great. 
I came here on Thursday to order a full cake for pick on Saturday. The young lady who helped me Thursday was great! Today tho, I came in and they were giving me trouble on picking up my cake. I had my pickup slip and paid for it in advance. It took them almost an hour to finally \"find\" the cake. They should have had it ready to be picked up in the front fridge. Next time have someone who knows what they're doing when dealing with customers. 
Not happy."}
{"text":"Walking through Cesars Palace we stumbled up Cheesecake Factory.  Was disappointed at first when we were seated upstairs in a small table right next to the kitchen doors where there was foot traffic galore.  We spotted an open booth and they happily moved us.  Thank gosh because it was probably the most awkward place to sit especially on a first date!  Whatever you are looking for, Cheesecake Factory has it.  I become impressed with menus that have options for a lower calorie meal, although 600 calories doesnt seem that low to me!  I ordered the healthy delight salmon with veggies.  I could have finished the entire thing but didn't want to look like a piglet! It was pretty great!  I was very pleased when in the mixed veggies a little bit of squash and eggplant was mixed in, it wasn't your basic green beans and carrots.  Although, there was green beans and carrots!  But it was all so good!  Service was very kind, prompt, although I had to ask 3 times for a straw and still never received one!  
The wait on a Friday night wasn't long, I think we got there at a good time because it was packed!"}
{"text":"We only went for a slice of cheesecake but it was delicious as per usual for Cheesecake Factory! Claire was our waitress and she was phenomenal - I highly recommend requesting her if you go since we will be requesting her when we make return visits.

We sat outside and they had the heaters going so it wasn't too cool to sit on the porch. I know the cheesecakes are pre-made and easy to serve, but it came out lightning fast and Claire was on top of refilling our drinks if we wanted it.  

Overall: A
Great dessert stop off with friendly service!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you're greeted with friendly staff. The whole interior is beautiful. You're quickly asked if you want to sit inside or sit out on the patio. 

If you're a patio person, come during the evening. The whole ambiance just seems to be romantic, that is if you're out on a date. 

As soon as we sat down, our waitress came and introduced herself. It was a little difficult to hear her with all the Music and people there so maybe they should alert their staff members to speak up. 

Our order was quickly taken along. If you don't know what type of food you want, come here. They have so many food choices to pick from for instance, Mexican, Italian, American etc. I went ahead with angel hair pasta with shrimp which in fact satisfied my appetite. 

After dinner, you're going to be asked if you want dessert. I didn't know what kind of cheese cake to try so I asked our server what new comers normally try and are pleased with. She suggested I try the red velvet cheesecake so I went ahead and ordered that. It was probably one of the best cheesecakes I've had in a while. A little on the sweet side but I scraped majority of the frosting off. 

Looking forward to coming back to another Cheesecake Factory, I might even come back to this specific location. 

Great environment, friendly staff, and tasteful food. 

(I'm giving four stars because our server was really nice until we left. It felt as if she was being nice to us up until we signed for the bill. I had just gotten off work but I don't think I looked like someone who wouldn't tip... Might I add, the rush server basically threw my plate on the table.)"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait as the lines are long for a new establishment. Once you're inside, you'll see a huge dining space and plenty of staff to serve you. The menu is gigantic, so ask your server for recommendations as they've tested them all during their training. They have favourites for sure. The deep fried Mac and cheese balls are definitely a must. I recommend the chicken bellagio for an entree. Large portions and decadent sauces to top off the meal. Once you're ready for dessert, you can't go wrong with any of their dozens of choices of cheesecake. Overall, a good experience with a long wait time. The staff are more than friendly to help out when needed."}
{"text":"Last night my bestie and I dined at the CCF with a friend from college and his co-worker who were both visiting from out of state. We were seated immediately. Drinks were served within minutes of our arrival. I ordered the avocado egg rolls (delicious!) and the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwich was very good, but I had to take 1/2 of it home because I was so full. My bestie ordered a salad and it was huge! Overall this was a pleasant dining experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I KNOW I wrote a long, detailed review after my last birthday experience here in December of 2012. So where is it? Who deleted it???

My friend took me here for my birthday at my request. I was craving avocado poppers so I ordered that and ...hmmm now I can't remember what I ordered, but it was probably steak.

My initial review was much more detailed, including a review of our waiter, but I have forgotten the details."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave comments but the the urge to get the worst experience out wins this time. 

We(group of 3) waited in the line for 1 hour to get a buzzer during lunch time on a Saturday. By the time we finally got our name down and a buzzer in hand, the host told us it's 60-85mins wait. It's ok so we waited. After TWO and HALF HOURS (you do the math. 60 mins my ass), the buzzer was still as quite as it was drained. We went back to the restaurant to ask for updates, and saw ppl after us in the line were already got seated(also a table for 3-4). We asked for the reason why the buzzer was not working/why someone behind us were got seat before us, no explanation or apologies were received(so RUDE) only a statement like\"you will be next\". Then we waited for another 20 mins to be\"next\" seated. 

Our server was nice and friendly, but SUPER SLOW just like the wait to get in. We WAITED to get the menu, WAITED to get the food, WAITED to get the bill. By the time we finish our \"lunch\", it was 5:30pm. The food and cheesecake were just average, nothing special or so good about it. Clearly it's overpriced. A slice of cheesecake for $10???? You can imagine the price of the other food. Carole's Cafe did a much better job on cheesecake and charged less. 

The food/service were not worth my time and money. Just some tips on the management: I understand that you can't expand the place to shorten the line, but at least GET MORE SERVER! And pls train your host well to be more polite."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was a nice and relaxing experience. The hostess was pleasant and our waitress was very attentive. We got a few appetizers for our meal and it was absolutely delicious! Only con was the Alcoholic beverages is a little overpriced"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, just go to a different CCF location. Don't get the server Victoria P. My order was messed up; food quality was awful. Although my friend enjoyed her food. I won't be back. HOWEVER, the manager Sean was very kind, that is why I gave it 2 stars. If it weren't for him, it's give ZERO stars. THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED AT MCDONALDS!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our fav spots!  So much goodness on the menu, our mouth orgazms come from: brown wheat bread, tex mex rolls, and chargrilled coulotte steak.  Perfect size to split between 2 peeps!  Ambiance is always nice and elegant, and service is consistent. 

I would offer 2 improvements: 1) don't like my silverware set on the table. 2) ability to make reservation."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am usually a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Despite the super crowded tables, I enjoy the food and the atmosphere. The service is never great, but that is something I have come to terms with. However, the Cheesecake Factory on the South Side had particularly TERRIBLE service when I went this weekend on Sunday night. 

It wasn't terribly busy, and we were seated right away (party of two). After being seated, we were not approached for an entire ten minutes. We were beginning to think they forgot about us, but were glad when the waitress came. She took our drink orders (just water) and we asked for bread, and then we didn't see her for another ten minutes at least. When she came back, she brought two waters but no bread, claiming that there wasn't any ready despite all of the tables around us receiving bread continuously from their respective waiters/waitresses. She refused to take our orders when she dropped the drinks off, so we had to wait. She came back around five-ten minutes later, and without bread again. She finally took our orders. About ten minutes after that, she came back and asked what we ordered again, because she \"was confused\" and got things mixed up. At this time, we decided to ask another waitress for bread, who brought it out within two minutes. A little bit later, our waitress came back, still claimed no bread had been made (despite us having received some, but not from her), and asked us if we had seen a credit card or any receipts lying around or under our table. She insisted we look under our table. Apparently she had lost the credit card and receipt of one of the tables she was waiting on. When the food came out, it was perfect and we were very pleased with that. Throughout the entire meal, she did not refill out waters once, she brought us no bread, and when I asked her to box my food, she never brought it back. Overall she was the worst waitress I have ever had and I cannot believe that the Cheesecake Factory has her working there. She is a disgrace to the restaurant. I will probably not return because I am so infuriated with how we were treated. We asked to speak to a manager and were told that there was not a manager present. I will likely try calling to inform them."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, we had a party of 7, and had a 40 minute wait for a table. It was worth it, a bit on the noisy end but the food was excellent and so was the service!"}
{"text":"When I heard my friends were going to the Cheesecake Factory, I had a feeling of being overwhelmed.  Why?   The menu is overwhelming. The space is overwhelming with ceilings that go higher than the sky.  The noise level is too much.  This place is good for groups, if you don't mind waiting in lines, loud conversations, and food that is made for the masses.   GO HERE to meet your friends to have fun.  We DID have fun!  I had the fish tacos and they were good.  The guacamole tasted fresh and the taco was actually really delicious.  But, I was still overwhelmed.   Gosh, now that I think about it, the feeling of being overwhelmed started in the parking lot.  Trying to find a place to park here is not impossible, but nearly impossible.  I was so excited all those years ago when The Cheesecake Factory came to Charlotte. It's amazing at how the years can change us and how we perceive foods and places and even our friends. I think our taste buds change too, over time.   If I could still eat cheesecake without the guilt (as I did 15 or 20 years ago), I would probably be writing a five star review.   As it is, I remain overwhelmed, but will agree that this was good enough for four stars.    If my friends said to meet them again here, I'd do it, especially if I had my earplugs and a tranquilizer."}
{"text":"This is second time to this cheesecake location and the family and I love it!!!  Appetizers were fantastic. Bacon grilled cheese so yum!!! Wife got the pineapple chicken shrimp and wouldn't stop gloating how good it is! Nephew ate all his pancake. I had the bacon bacon burger and barely could eat cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant. Extensive menu,  friendly waiters, good food.
Nice atmosphere .
It's a safe choice."}
{"text":"This stupid chain of restaurants thought that they were so good that they needed to cook every type of cuisine and water their menu down to the point of all the food being tasteless!! Just because you specialize in cheesecake does not mean that your expensive meals need no consideration and consistency. It's too much going on. I had the Chicken Riesling and it was disgusting.It didn't taste like there was a drop of Riesling cooked with it.The pasta tasted like unfiltered dirty water with no salt.The meal was suppose to have bacon and caramelized onions and their was about a teaspoon of each...I ate with 5 other people and they all hated their pasta dishes as well as a dry burger on a hard crusty baguette (who eats a burger on a baguette?) and my grandmothers meal was forgotten and super late after we waited an hour after being seated to eat. Then I was charged for a top shelf drink that the waitress admitted was only worth $7 Gordon Ramsay should be a reviewer of the whole company and get the company shut down."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cheesecake Factory on occasion for years and, as far as chains go, it's not bad. I appreciate that they've made an effort to use healthier ingredients and offer lower calorie options. The ambiance is quite loud, but it does say factory in the name and the ceilings are high. It is old world style decor and somewhat darker inside. It tends to be clean, but I've gotten sticky menus on occasion which I do not like at all. The menus are books and probably hard to keep up with when they're busy, which they are often. 

I typically enjoy my food here. It is consistent. You always know what you're getting. The food and beverage selections are vast. The service is usually good. The portions have shrunk over the years. This probably had to do with having to list calorie counts in the menu. They'd be astronomical otherwise. What I don't understand is why the prices are so dang high. The value is poor. We dine and drink out frequently, but we don't come here often because of the bill at the end. You can get great food elsewhere for much better prices and service overall."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the US. I really wasn't expecting the opulence of the interior, so my senses were a little overwhelmed. I got there about 10 minutes before they opened, so as I sat in the car waiting I got to watch the throng of staff as they filtered in. I've never seen that large a number of staff at a restaurant in my entire life. 

As many have said, the menu is way too extensive and the pages of advertising are off-putting. I was greeted almost immediately by a lead waiter and a young man that he was training. Both were very attentive. They both did something I personally find a little annoying, which was to say something like \"excellent choice\" upon my selection of items. My self-esteem is fine, I really don't need my ego massaged. 

I ordered the lunch pepperoni pizza with side salad, and both were good. I followed that with the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake, and it would be worth the 52-mile round trip just to have that again. 

The cost for the lunch, including a 20% tip, was $27. As a retired teacher, I find that very pricey, but it was still a good experience. I'd definitely reserve this for only special occasions due to the price."}
{"text":"It's the Cheesecake Factory, what else can you write????  Excellent food, fantastic cheesecake selection. This is always one of our destinations on our frequent, yearly visits to Sun City, Arizona. Everyone finds plenty to choose from and the food is ALWAYS excellent."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is a mandatory stop when in the USA, every place I travel and they have a CF I am there, the menu is huge, consistent, and satisfying. A Family pleaser! I always try new things but some favs include Steak Diane, Tuna Tartare, Chicken Madeira,.I try to save room for desert but never works, I have to get a slice of cheesecake to go,.cheesecake factory always hits the right spot, the portions are big, the prices are great, a must if you haven't tried before."}
{"text":"It was busy, but we were seated quickly. Great food and great service. Our server,  Sage, was great, funny and provided awesome service! We absolutely adored her! Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Monday afternoon at 5:15 PM and waited less than 30 minutes for a table for 2, so the lineups aren't so bad if you can come at off-peak hours.

I had the honey-truffle fried chicken, which was excellent (I've never had truffles before, to my knowledge) and I would say perfectly sized -- I'm a healthy eater and I can say I was neither stuffed nor hungry afterwards. The mashed potatoes were just the way I like them, too -- a bit chunky, with some skins and garlic.

My wife had the chicken & biscuits, which she said was excellent as well, although she was unable to completely finish it. Her mashed potatoes were the same as mine, and the chicken cutlets in the light chicken gravy were very nice.

Definitely get at least one order of the free table bread, even if you're worried about filling up before your entree. It's hot and fresh and the dark bread -- sweet pumpernickel? -- is delicious.

We managed to have enough room for dessert -- *don't* order an appetizer unless you're a table for 4 or more or else you'll never even scratch your entree. I found the \"30th Anniversary\" chocolate cake cheesecake a bit too sweet and chocolatey, what with the fudge swirl on the top and the chocolate chips on the back. My wife had the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake and said that the raspberries were just tart enough to offset the sweetness of the white chocolate.

Our server was very attentive and we hardly waited at all for our food or our dessert. Granted, we did come at just the right time, but I had a very pleasant experience and I'll surely come back again."}
{"text":"2 stars only because I enjoyed the cheesecake,  waitress was rude to us. Our food was so bland. Just a huge bowl of noodles no flavor.  I will never come back for dinner I however may consider cheesecake"}
{"text":"This is our first visit ever to The Cheesecake Factory.  We would of never tried it, but we had a gift card.  We decided on lunch on a Saturday.  Our server Amber was very friendly and attentive and we got our drinks right away....we love when that happens.  We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza which was very good, our son order from the kids menu only 3.95, which is a good deal. The food came out fast and it was good!  
Now, the bar area is very inviting, roomy and open.  They have a happy hour special Mon-Fri from 4-6pm.  2.50 drafts, but they only had two to choose from.  Decent wine menu and HH special on some wines at 4 bucks.  The only downside to this location is it is very hard to get there.  It is in a weird location at the Superstition Mall.  Other than that we can't wait to go back and try the cheesecake."}
{"text":"If you're not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, the name should imply that their menu is full of flavorful high-calorie offerings. But it may not imply so well that this place is rather expensive-- on the border of outlandishly.

However, their menu is extremely robust, I don't think I can recall another restaurant with so many different things on their menu. Their cheesecake is outstanding, of course, but some of their other menu items can be hit or miss. (For example, their Buffalo Blasts are not as good as they sound, but everything else we tried was rather decent)

It's a good place to go for a special occasion, I can't really say don't go-- but for the same (or less) money I can get higher quality at other places."}
{"text":"Great go to restaurant when you are just not sure what you want or you are dining with finicky folks.  Their menu is so all encompassing you'll have a hard choosing a dish.  Simply cannot go wrong with a salad from Cheesecake Factory, Santa Fe is my go to one and I get it near on every visit."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was my first time eating a meal at The Cheesecake Factory. I've picked up a few slices of cheesecake at the Thousand Oaks location, but hadn't sat down to eat until now. I was a little hesitant to visit a chain restaurant during our Vegas trip, but after looking at the menus of other nearby establishments, TCF seemed like the best option. And speaking of options, there is something for everyone here. The menu is like a novel. I can see this being a great place for large families, because one person may want Mexican another pasta, etc. The service here was very good. They came to refill water often. I had a roasted chicken dish with potatoes and carrots. I was pleasantly surprised, being that it is a chain restaurant. The portions were plenty and there was no room for yummy cheesecake. And everything was reasonably priced. If you're going to choose a chain restaurant, this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here on our way out of Vegas (always have to hit The Forum Shops before we leave).  Although it's not as good as its sister company, Grand Lux, it was still good.  

I got the Kobe Burger, which makes that 3 times now total.  Such a great burger and it was cooked perfectly.  Our waitress (forget her name) was very upbeat (almost too much) and did an ok job at refilling our drinks and returning to our table in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Yes this is a huge chain restaurant with locations all over the United States but this is a very good one. Every location has a very similar layout and decor, yet each one is uniquely different depending on the space or building it's located in. 

The menu is the same though and the food is very good. Everything is very fresh and tastes great. It's a huge menu though which can be frustrating if you are hungry. We are talking everything from Asian to a simple hamburger. Not to worry though, you are going to like whatever you try. 

My most recent visit I had the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer and a classic hamburger. Both were outstanding! 

Staff is always friendly and if something isn't right, they will make it right with no questions asked. They can substitute just about anything on the menu as well. 

Cocktails are pretty darn good too, there is a large cocktail menu as well. 

You can also visit Grand Lux Cafe, Cheesecake's sister restaurant. Different menu, but just as extensive. Just as good too!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Place is ok. It's to be expected. I never did like this place since I was living in NY.  Food is ok deserts suck and so does the service.
Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"It took a long time even for ordering takeout. We ordered a piece of mango key lime cheesecake. It looked very nice and came with cream. However, it tasted ok - not as good as those from well-established cheesecake bakeries in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love the ccf.  Had the ny steak.  Wife had parm crusted chicken.  Both great.  Shout out to a very friendly server Kristen L.   Ask for her section.  Service with a smile."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went for lunch and brought our 1 year old daughter.  The waitress broughy her bananas which she LOVES and bread thank you for going above and beyond.  My boyfriend first time he got the cajun pasta myself i ordered the jambalaya both good will be back don't order the pineapple jalapeño margarita unless you throughly enjoy jalapeños . Very attentive staff, great food, atmosphere and kid friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this location about 6 times. WELL, after my most recent 2 visits, I will NOT go back to this one. I got sick from the shepherds pie but decided to give it another try & after 2 bites, it was SO greasy, I sent it back. I then ordered just zucchini sticks & they looked like something they picked up from the floor. service was mediocre at best. so between bad service & bad food why would I want to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to stop here and get the cheesecake for a special treat. Today, as usual, we stopped, chose our favorites, paid, then headed home to enjoy our special treats. Today something was noticeably different. It seems Cheesecake Factory has caved to cheapness and convenience and switched to compressed air whipped cream. After all, isn't the real, heavy, whipped cream all part of the decadence of purchasing a $7.95 piece of cheesecake?! I am giving the cheesecake dessert and restaurant three stars because I want you to know the importance of REAL WHIPPED CREAM! After all, isn't the dessert the main reason people come here? This is the Rampart location in Summerlin, Las Vegas, Nevada. 
My husband and I are so disappointed, that, unless, this \"mistake\" is corrected we will no longer frequent Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I go there daily and the food is amazing. Customer service is unmatched and the ambiance is chill. Love this place and you should try it."}
{"text":"What is this place? Italian? Mexican? Chinese? Coma-inducing bakery?
Yes. 

This place is ridiculous. As I sat down (from a 10 minute wait. Guess I got lucky), I passed by what looked like EPCOT center. So many good looking plates of food from so many different cultures.

I was wary that with a 15 page menu featuring advertisements the food would not be good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got some sort of Italian thing and it was quite good. It seemed fresh and made today, not freeze-dried.

The portions, like everything else in Pittsburgh food, are huge. So huge, we wound up getting our cheesecake to go to eat at home. Not a bad deal, but you'd want to eat it there considering it's called the Cheesecake Factory, not the Generic Styrofoam Take-Out Box Factory.

I can see why people want to come here so much because you could eat here for 10 years and never get the same thing."}
{"text":"Always love this Cheesecake Factory - The food is absolutely amazing, the cheesecake is epic and the service is phenomenal. I've been here several times since moving to Las Vegas and intend to continue regularly as my girlfriend enjoys it as much as I do. Just overall a great experience for couples, friends, and family alike!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I thought this was not going to be good- how can a restaurant with a 20+ menu possibly be good. 4 of us wanted about 30 minutes for a table. Got a glass of Chardonnay that was delicious and waited it out by the bathrooms- there's a bench there that was empty! 

Our server was a bit over the top but no water glass was left half full so that was nice. I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad which was ginormous. Didn't even finish it and I'm not one of the those \"oh couldn't possible eat all of this lettuce\" type of girls. I can eat. It was huge. 

All 4 of us were happy and I took home a piece of the original cheesecake to share with my better half at home. So good- it was rich and creamy and I can see why it's the namesake item. I would go back for that any day."}
{"text":"gotta love cheesecake factory! came here for dinner with my roomie and we were not disappointed. got seated right away. service was good although our servers nice attitude seemed a bit forced. i had the tuna tataki salad which was great and the dutch apple streusal cheesecake. the cheesecake was the perfect mix of sweets. mmmm so good."}
{"text":"love love love cheesecake factory! came in on a sunday at peak dinner hour. we were able to get seats right away in the bar area. i like that this place has a little bit of everything. a little asian, a little mexican, etc. the menu is huge which makes it hard to choose something to eat sometimes. i had the garlic noodles with chicken which was very tasty. my friends ordered the chicken enchiladas and the combo of steak diane and salmon. all of it very good. didn't order any cheesecake this time which is a first! service was great. can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is the second time in a row that I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory, and the service sucked again!  The server did not check on our table of six even once.  We went for lunch on a weekday, and the entire meal took an hour and a half (some of us work and and some point need to go back!)  There were other tables that arrived and ordered after us, but ate and left before us, even though we had the same server.   Two of us in the group ordered a lunch salad and sandwich combo, but  substituted for an upgraded salad.  While the server said there \"might be a small up-charge\" for the difference, she ending up charging us an additional entree charge ($11) because she said that the difference for the two salads equals one entree so it was just easier for her to put in on the check that way.  WTF?  I've never heard of anything like that, and charging half the cost of an additional entree for a salad up-charge is ridiculous.  The customer service at this CF is non-existent.  I'm  giving two stars because the food is good, even though the employees are sub-par."}
{"text":"Pretty good! The food wasn't the best I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory (I prefer the Santa Fe salad to the Chicken Tostada salad I had today). We also go a pizza, a Caesar salad, and some hamburgers. 

The service, however, was wonderful. We were checked on several times throughout our meal and our drinks never got empty, which is a big deal for me!

Also, we got right in at what seemed to be a busy hour. All of our service was prompt and polite!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service! 
We were seated in the additional seating area which was almost empty and 3 other tables that arrived after us received drinks and bread before we did! We asked twice and they told us that everyone was waiting for bread to which I pointed out that 3 other tables right next to us , that arrived after us, had already gotten drinks and bread! 
Our food arrived an hour later along with the first round of bread... Terrible service!!!!"}
{"text":"Going to the Cheesecake factory was a walk down memory lane. I remember back in high school when I was so excited to go here. I thought I was so fancy bringing girls here after a movie, where the ceilings were so tall, the walls decorated with classy moulding, and stone flooring where the click of heels can be heard as crisp as a bell. High school me thought that this was the Waldorf. Now that I've lived a bit, I know how silly it seems to be so impressed with the Cheesecake Factory, but coming \"back\" here after so many years gave a helpful heap of nostalgia in a time of the year of thinking back.

The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant with the same corporate structure (I think) of others like the Olive Garden or Applebee's. The food has stayed impressively uniform across time and space, and even the architecture and decor are carefully curated to produce the same ambiance across all of their restaurants. The food is a cross-section of presentable but comfortably familiar American foods, such as shrimp scampi or steak Diane, as well as delightful Asian fusion items like Thai spring rolls that are scattered within the menu to liven up the palate of their extensive menu. And, as the name of the restaurant might suggest, there is cheesecake and plenty of it.

First, my order: a crab and artichoke dip for appetizer; chicken marsala (chicken in a mushroom and Marsala wine sauce) and pasta (I asked for angel hair instead of the default farfalle*); and a Godiva three-chocolate cheesecake. A lot of food, that's for sure. The food is not bad. Sure, it's nothing to be blown away by, since it's a chain restaurant and not run by a celebrity chef. The crab in the dip was probably canned or frozen and lacked the oceanic umami typical of fresh crab. The chicken was pretty tender, the pasta not overcooked, and the mushrooms well-seasoned and the main source of savory in this dish. A small part of me suspects that the sauce was premade because it feels thickened artificially, but it could just be the quirk of the chef to prefer their Marsala sauce with a slicker and thicker consistency than what I'm used to. 

I guess in hindsight this shouldn't really be a surprise, but the cheesecake ended up being the highlight of the evening. It is composed of three forms of chocolate cake layered on top of each other. On the bottom is a flowerless chocolate cake. In the middle is a traditional cheesecake of chocolate flavor and composition. The top layer is chocolate mousse. All of the chocolate are from Godiva, and you also get a hearty slice with two large clouds of whipped cream (I'm pretty sure canned though) on the side. I was particularly happy with the cheesecake because 1) I haven't had chocolate in a very long time, and this reminded me of how delicious chocolate is; and 2) it's not too sweet, which I was afraid of going in. There were tons and tons of other options, so I can really only vouch for one very specific choice among the cornucopia of cheesecake options available.

For me, if this meal were served to me without any hint of what restaurant it was from, I'd be less impressed with the food itself. But for me, and I hope for many others, the Cheesecake Factory is delightfully innocent. In other chain restaurants, there are always promotions and deals that make you aware of how commercial the entire endeavor is, and then when enough food for four people are put in front of one person, your eyes glaze over and you're focused less on tasting and more on eating. I don't want to feel like a deal hunter on Black Friday, out hunting for the highest calorie count with the lowest dollars. The Cheesecake Factory, with their menu of familiar food items culminating in a winning dessert, brings in the mind of this reviewer the comfort of familiarity and pleasure of being disarmingly charming. And it's not expensive! This three-course meal came out to $40. The Cheesecake Factory is meant to be accessible to everybody, and without feeling exploitative. Here I am just reminded of decent food and a fun and cheerful experience.


*I strongly dislike farfalle because it's never cooked evenly given its uneven thickness. The edges are mushy while the \"knot\" stays doughy and uncooked. I feel that too few people notice this, so consider this a PSA against farfalle."}
{"text":"I could eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner - 24/7 365 days a year. The menu is so diverse and theres always something for everyone. Staff is also always friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this Cheesecake Factory for dinner last night, as we have patronized The Cheesecake Factory in both Chicago and North Phoenix.  The food was excellent,  however the waitress seemed to be in a rush to get us checked out.  We were not quite yet done with our dinners,  and she was asking if we would like her to bring a box for leftovers or if we prefer she box them up for us.  When I replied - \"it doesn't matter yet\" - she immediately took the liberty to remove our plates without even asking if we were finished!! I even commented to her if she was trying to rush us out of there,  and she pretended as though she didn't even hear me.  I made the comment twice to her!  There was absolutely no excuse for her to behave in this manner,  as the restaurant did not even have people waiting to be seated.  The service on the part of this particular waitress leaves a lot to be desired!"}
{"text":"I'd tried the Cheesecake Factory about 6 years ago in the States and had an amazing meal, so undoubtedly I was thrilled when they opened up 10 minutes from my house.

It was day 3 after opening, so we hoped the wait would be a little shorter. We got a buzzer around 1:45pm, did a little pre-Black Friday shopping, and were seated around 3:15pm. 

I ordered the ahi tartare and crispy crab bites, while my friend got the fettuccini alfredo with chicken. I am such a sucker for the combination of avocado + raw fish, so I absolutely loved my choice. We then shared the 'coffee & cream chocolate supreme' cheesecake (each slice is HUGE we could barely finish the one between the two of us). We had originally ordered the 'white chocolate caramel macadamia nut', but were informed a while later that they had run out. Service was overall slow, which was to be expected during opening week, but we were especially confused when the cheesecake took 20 minutes to bring out.

Regardless of the extra time spent here, the food is delicious, and I look forward to tackling the rest of their vast menu in the very near future."}
{"text":"I've been so busy I have not had time to write this review for The Cheesecake Factory on 83rd Avenue and Bell Road. I was in last week and had a Pit Beef Dip. It was horrible it was the cheapest made worst-tasting sandwich I have ever had. First off not once not twice but three separate times when taking a bite I hit the paper skin from The Onion.  The meat of which there was very little would not have even been comparable to Subway because it's lack of quality. Please note this sandwich was $14 and I could have got a better sandwich at Subway Arby's or any Delicatessen. Normally I would not have been so bothered as much if it would have been for the poor attitude of my waitress. When I pointed it out to her she said \"so you hit the skin of the onion I will let the kitchen know\".  Then she asked if there was anything else she could do for me today or if I was ready for my check. I was flabbergasted no empathy or at least a simple apology!  I thought why even go to the manager  this all ready shows their lack of management skills an obvious inability to properly train their servers and the poor quality of food they provide. From my experience The Cheesecake Factory is a classy facade with a lackluster of Quality help and food."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has got to be one of my favorite restaurants! I loved it when I lived in Washington and I still love it when I tried it in Vegas. I am a big fan of there happy hour menu and drinks, very delicious. However if I have to choose my favorite by far... Has got to be the Luau Salad! So delicious!!! Nutty, sesame goodness with a thick layer of crispy wonton sheet and chicken breast. They have it in there lunch special menu as well :)"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Summerlin.  Good variety.   Great brunch menu.  Great service at the bar.  

Continues to get better with time."}
{"text":"I absolutely never in a million years thought that I would give a Cheesecake Factory 5 stars.  I was in Vegas for the marathon and my friends and I needed to find a place to eat the morning of our race.  I didn't want to do a buffet and I also wanted something very plain and simple due to the fact that 4 hours later I'd be running 26 miles.  

We stumbled up Cheesecake Factory and I honestly had low expectations, but I was extremely wrong! Times have changed and while the pasts is not vegan and like pretty much no entree is veganizable - I had a great meal! our server was amazing - she pretty much just created a vegan feast (plain and simple though) out of sides, appetizers and salad. 

I had a great meal and a great experience - but um hello potion sizes there are huge!"}
{"text":"We snuck out for some apps and, of course, to share a slice of cheesecake. I tried the new Cuban Roll app and it was amazing. 

The service (Issac F) was just plain BAD. Waited forever for our food and then, the flatbread was cold, as was the chicken in our lettuce wrap. 

After we ate, we stared at our dirty dishes for another 15 or 20 minutes. I was so pissed, I left without getting my cheesecake. 

I'm in a bad mood now. The front of the house definitely dropped the ball."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars in my book.  Ive been meaning to review this place and now two years later I have finally gotten around to it.  The place was definitely busy as described in most reviews.  The server was quite friendly and checked back frequently to top up our drinks.  You would think that is standard but you would be surprised the lack of service you get going to some places.  The food was on point and consistent with the quality of Cheesecake Factory food.  Definitely enjoyed the experience dining here. Id come back."}
{"text":"I was eating here 3 to 4 times a month for years because almost everything on the menu is delicious.  However over the past 6 months or so the service has become horrible.  Firstly, make sure to look at your silverware before using it because on multiple occasions there was large chucks of food on them.  I recently called in a to go order and waited on hold for over 20 minutes just to place the order.  I usually call my orders in before leaving the house so by the time I arrive it will be ready.  By the time was able to place the order I was already in the parking lot.  Waited 40 mintues in the parking lot just to come in and find a line at the register where I waited another 30 minutes because they lost the order of the people in front of me and instead of having a manager deal with it while helping the other 10+ people in line they just made everyone wait.  When it was finally my turn I notice the order they originally brought out for the lady in front of me that had been sitting on the counter for 30+ minutes was mine.  My food was ice cold when I got home and when I called to complain the manager told me I could drive back and they would have another order ready in 30 minutes. After spending a hour and half previously trying to pick up food, the last thing I wanted to do spend another 40 minutes of my life dealing with their incompetence.  The managers careless attitude and simple reply that they were busy will be the reason I will never be going back."}
{"text":"We were given a gift card. We first went on Sunday afternoon. I was a madhouse w/ a 45 min wait. We went to Hoosong's instead (which was great). We went back to the CF this afternoon & it was not very busy at all with whole sections unused but we still had to wait 10 min for a table. We told the waiter that we would need time to look over the menu. He brought water but no bread. We ordered but didn't get the bread until just minutes before our entrees arrived. My beer was forgotten about & after a reminder it arrive when I was half finished. My wife's plate was taken to be wrapped & forgotten about but was bought out after another reminder. We split a pice of cheesecake but couldn't finish it because it was sooooo overly sweet. Other than that the food was about average for a Marie Callender's but twice the price. Overall bad experience for which I was glad not to have to pay (but it was a pretty bad gift)."}
{"text":"I never order entree/etc at the Cheesecake Factory. Only cheesecakes.  I usually get waited on quickly and don't wait too long for my cheesecakes.  I haven't had a bad cheesecake yet."}
{"text":"This location in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace needs to get their act together. If you tell a party of 7 that it will take 1.5-1.75 hours you need to make sure to seat them at that time especially when you have sr. citizens in the party who need to eat. 

It is understandable during a long holiday weekend that it will be long lines anywhere, but it shouldn't require manager intervention to make sure we get seated after waiting for 2 hours.

I've been to Cheesecake Factory all over California as well as Summerlin ... I expected more from this location. Terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"i had the herb crusted salmon. it was really, really good. they served it on broccoli instead of mashed potatoes because i asked. the group ordered the h u g e sampler platter, which gave 7 people each an adequate serving - it would provide more than enough for a party of 4. the food was good and i liked the variety. i am, of course, annoyed by the excessively long menu, complete with advertisements, but whatever, the salmon was surprisingly good. and yeah, they do make awesome cheesecake, including the low carb one. for me, the cheesecake factory is is a-ok."}
{"text":"This review of the cheesecake factory is primarily based on service. Went there today for brunch and sat out on the patio. We got there at 11:45 and started off with an order of cocktails. I would say that we received our cocktails by noon which for brunch I can understand having to wait a little longer for drinks. We then put our food order in with the server Juliet. Egg rolls, chicken and waffles Benedict, and an omelette. So no exaggeration whatsoever it took literally almost an hour to receive our food. On top of it there were tables that sat around us three to be exact that had been there probably 10 or 15 minutes and received their food at the same time we did and we waited an hour. I am almost sure the server forgot to put in our food and to be honest if that was the case she should've communicated that to us instead she barely even checked on us at the table. Then when we decided to mention that the eggs Benedict came out with the eggs over hard and she clearly stated that's not how they should've come out she offered to pull the plate so they can make another one. Now let's keep in mind we already waited an hour for our food so why would we have a plate pulled to be remade. We felt like we were in inconvenience to our server. She didn't care about our experience because honestly when you go out for a birthday brunch I think what you are paying for is not just the food but the experience of it all!"}
{"text":"I remember makin' my way Downtown (sorta) when this Cheesecake Factory opened. I wasn't impressed. They messed up my order and the Mac and cheese was not up to par with the one at Caesar's. I didn't have high expectations for my return, but what can I say, it's the mediocre yet deliciously free bread that keeps me coming back. 

I brought a friend to share a plate with me. She had her doubts about sharing since she was starving, but I know my way around a Cheesecake Factory. We ordered the chicken costoletta and swapped out the side of veggies with a side of mac and cheese. If you haven't tried the mac and cheese at CF, do so immediately, it might restore your faith in them. The serving size was huge, of course, and we were unbutton-the-pants full. It was awesome. I had plans to buy a cheesecake slice, but we were meeting up with our friends and I didn't want any vultures stealing my cheesecake, you know how it is. Our server was very nice and very knowledgeable, I wish I had gotten her name. 

Only downside of this trip: host said 10-15 minute wait and we waited over 30. We almost left, but that mac and cheese was calling my name. Have I mentioned the mac and cheese yet? 

... mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The appetizers deserve some praise (I like the \"Vietnamese\" summer rolls and the pot stickers).   If you stop there, you'll like it.  Ironic that Maggiano's down the parking lot has a better cheesecake."}
{"text":"For me, The Cheesecake Factory works.  I like the big menu though I tend to stick to a few favorites.  The food is always impressive and delicious.  Yes, it is a little pricey and corporate is probably raking in a tidy sum, but I generally love eating out and the high prices just means I won't be here quite as much, but I will make the pilgrimage a few times a year.

People talk about the high calorie entrees, but the \"Skinny-licious\" menu solves all this.  I usually order off of that menu to either save room for dessert or because I'm watching my calories and I have never been disappointed.  Everything I've ordered off that menu is excellent  and I can't believe I'm eating a low-cal meal.

Also enjoy the bread basket -- the darker bread (rye/pumpernickel?) rocks.  The standard bread is good, but not as much as the other in my opinion.

I'm sure it's no surprise to anyone that the cheesecake selection is impressive.  When we do treat ourselves, one slice for the two of us is all we need.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't prepared properly and when I asked for them to prepare it again it was horrible! Very disappointed and won't return to this location!"}
{"text":"my favorite restaurant! their nachos are to die for! wonderful location too."}
{"text":"I have eaten there many times and find it to be a ok dinning experience, It is really just a higher class of Denny's with a much larger menu . we find the food to be generally bland and not all that well presented. However the portions are large and the staff very friendly and well trained ."}
{"text":"We we're seated very fast and we're brought our appetizers pretty quick. About 10 minutes after ordering all of our food a gentleman came up to us and informed us that there was no more prime rib. Our waitress Bree soon followed after. She was unaware that there was no more prime rib. The gentleman proceeded asked my husband what other selection he would like. He hovered over him until he made a decision. At no point did the gentleman or our waitress apologize for the inconvenience. Our food was brought out at different times. Upon receiving the order that my husband chose it was quite Untasty and  had no flavor. Our waitress didn't bother to ask us how we liked their food nor did her or management do anything about the inconvenience. Although my food was brought to me hot and tastes well the lack of customer service and poor communication between the kitchen staff and waitstaff has caused this negative review. We will not be attending this location anymore because of it."}
{"text":"Years ago when I lived in Marina del Rey CA a Cheesecake Factory was near by and we went fairly often......it was excellent.  Went to the Peoria, AZ branch and had a terrible experience.  Opted to sit on the patio but they couldn't decide where to sit us and kept changing our table.  Finally sat us a table that was perfect and not under the sun....but a person came along and said it was being held for a party of 9, we were only 5.  They changed us again and that 9 group  showed with a party of 6.   The cutlery had to be sent back 3 times it was so dirty  The server was not too pleasant about this problem.  One of our party went to complain to the manager and so they gave us our desserts N/C........fine, but it didn't improve the service or other problems we had.
We will never go back!  Too bad I couldn't give it \"O\" star."}
{"text":"Kind of upset. My steak tacos was cold. It came out twice and then I decided to settle for fish tacos (which was something I didn't want). Mind you the waitress told the cooks to not put pico on the tacos but they still did the 2nd timeI got full off of bread and my two tequila sunrises because it took them forever to bring out my food all 3 times and then I decided not to get any food. I am extremely upset at this place. The waitress kept apologizing but the manager didn't care. He took the food and took it off my check. I came to eat not sit and wait for cold food. They didn't even come sing happy Birthday to my friend after we said it was her birthday in the beginning. Disappointed! 

Update: Westlake Cheesecake Factory is better."}
{"text":"I am finally satisfied! I knew westlake was better! My drink was where it needed to be. My food was delicious."}
{"text":"i was there for my friends dinner the day before the wedding.  i did not know before that you could have dinner there i thought it  was just cheesecakes :-)  i cant tell you the price because my friends mom payed . i would not have gone on my own because i was trying to do stuff unique to Vegas .  but the food here was really good and you get allot of it"}
{"text":"Visited on the Saturday before Easter around 2pm, and was shocked to be seated immediately! This was my first time at this particular location but it seems to me that these places are always a zoo, regardless of when you visit (on top of that they don't seem to use Open Table or No Wait). 
I thought I might have been a bit childish in ordering the Mac n Cheese Burger, that has a fried ball of mac n cheese atop the usual lettuce, tomato, onion inclusions, but it was fantastic! If you're attempting to be good or at least feel less guilty about dessert as I was, the house salad side in lieu of French fries is truly worth opting for aside the burger. 
I'm not sure how long the 30th anniversary edition cheesecake will be in stock, but check out the description and seriously consider it if chocolate cake and chocolate fudge paired with cheesecake appeals to you.
Service was great, 2 soft drinks, 2 meals, 1 slice of cheesecake and 22% tip came to $67- well worth it!"}
{"text":"Sangria and Red velvet cheesecake!

As I mentioned in another post I love this chain and wish they'd come to Ireland. After dinner at Grimaldi's in the Venetian we came here for dessert.

Queued for about 40 minutes and got three seats at the bar.

I chose red velvet cheesecake and sangria.

Red velvet has got to be my favourite. Enjoy the pics ;)"}
{"text":"Service was good but  the food I thought could of been better but the Adam's cheese cake is the way to go.....I don't even like cheescake but it's a very rich and Big piece....it was around $7 for a slice but you can split it with someone. Nice place for dessert!"}
{"text":"Located in the South Park mall this is a busy area.  ONE MAJOR NOTE if you go on a weekend be prepared to wait they estimated 3 to 2 1/2 hours on Saturday night!

The inside of this place is huge one of the biggest CKF I have ever been in. They are one of the better chain restaurants with one of the biggest menu's I ever seen.  It is pages upon pages of options.  

The food
They always start you off with some bread which is decent nothing specially but always fresh and warm which is key.  I ordered Shepards Pie yes you heard me right at CKF.  It is one of the best I have ever had.  It is my favorite comfort food and it is hard to find at most places.  It had great flavor and the portion was generous. 

Staff
Everyone was very friendly I have never had a bad experience at this place.  My waitress was helpful and attentive.  

Verdict
I am not a huge \"chain\"  guy but CKF is one of the few I would go to if I am in the area.  The food is really good and the selection is second to none."}
{"text":"We had a certificate for 50$ to go since our last experience was bad in Glendale. We decided to come here and it was way better. The waitress was nice. The lemon drop tasted great. I ordered pork chops with applesauce mac n cheese and asparagus. The pork chop was good but a little tougher than I'd like. The flavor on everything was good. My husband got chipotle chicken sandwich and it was perfectly done with fries. The ambience was romantic and cozy! We enjoyed ourselves I just wish they didn't charge 5$ just to change mash potatoes and greens beans to Mac n asparagus..."}
{"text":"Fresh yummy brunch with a nice atmosphere the waiter was timely and the restaurant was clean"}
{"text":"Wow never had bad things to say about this cheesecake until today.. got cold hardened pasta like it sat all day. I showed waiter and he had manager come and the manager did not seem interested much. You could tell he was just doing the bare minimum as he seemed liked we were interrupted him. My husband was done eating by the time my food came out still looking substandard. The manager brought the plate and Comp the dish but his presence was the same. While preparing to leave I overheard the couple next to us say to another group their food was overcooked and both groups said waste of time and money. They told manager as well and again he seemed uncaring just saying oh wow sorry yet in a fake tone."}
{"text":"Terrible service, Tina V approached us with a terrible attitude, messed up our orders and gave the nonvirgin bloody Mary to my pregnant wife and then refused to remove it from the check afterwards, however the manager was exceptional very nice Cesar was great in getting everything fixed"}

I LOVE THIS PLACE!

Go with a big appetite!

The staff is very professional, very clean warm atmosphere and a awesome  dining experience!

I always get the chicken oriental, yum  so delicious every single time!

Ok, really, desert is the best!  
Yum  yum  yum!
Cheese Cake - OMG SNICKERS!

So Awesome, everybody should go, it's fabulous!"}
{"text":"Long wait on a Friday night which is to be expected but by the time the food came we had a layer of coagulated gravy which had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp while the other foods were prepared.  Also, my husband was interested in a cheesecake but when they quoted us 50 bucks we had to decline.  It's good but not that good.  It was my daughters birthday and they brought out a shot glass of Ice-cream...a shot glass.  All in all our service was great but I am always disappointed by the food."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a long walk through the forum shops. No waiting time on a Friday night. The shrimp scampi that I ordered is delicious. Shrimps are cooked and fried to the par and angel hair pasta is as usual tasty. Best part of the dish is the sauce made with lemon, sautéed garlic cloves, fresh basil, tomato, and white wine. Enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is not fast food nor fast casual. Complaining about a wait should not result in deductions! Friends, there are plenty of empty restaurants around if you want immediate seating! 

Everything about Madison's Cheesecake Factory was on point and comparable to long established locations - except for the hostess and hostess stand. There needs to be immediate attention here because the hostess doesn't look up. Telling people to stand to the side for 40 minutes probably hundreds of times per shift seems ridiculous and could be why she is so surly. Post some signs or get some sort of dividers or something.

If you can get past the discombobulated mess that is the first piece of the experience, it gets better. Server (Briana, I think) was prompt, thorough, energetic, and friendly. She knew about the menu. That's a pro who can answer as to what's on the plate but not listed in the menu. That helped me. When my Asian dish came out it was better looking than any other Asian dish I've had. Yes, the rice was a little heavy and fresh pineapple a little light but that's not the end of the world.

As you know if you've ever been to TCF before, portions are huge. You're getting two servings whatever the dish is!

Cakes and pies are huge, pretty, and tasty! 

TCF Madison doesn't disappoint in the food. We will be back but hope some changes are made to the hostess/holding area."}
{"text":"Came here months ago around the Christmas time, not long after they had just opened. I'm sure the food quality and wait time has gotten better now but for our experience, it didn't live up to the hype or the experience we had in the States. The food and service was alright, just wasn't worth what we paid for. I'd come back for the cheesecakes for sure. (The picture is Tomato Basil Pasta 6/10)"}
{"text":"Service and food was good. I really enjoyed the burrito and strawberry cheesecake. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night and the wait wasn't bad when we got there, but when we left the lines were really long. This is the typical Cheesecake Factory...the food was just okay, but the cheesecake was yummy!! I had the grilled cheese sandwich and my DH had the bacon cheeseburger, both of which weren't anything special. For an appetizer we had the chicken taquitos which were kind of icky - really slimy inside. We had the lemon raspberry cheesecake which was really good! So it was all really just okay...nothing special and kind of pricey!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointing. Some of my friends rave about this place, some hate it. After eating there a second time I decided never again. The orange chicken and fish tacos were not good. The meatloaf...yeah, the meatloaf of all things, was the only decent thing we ordered. The cheesecake is great, I must say and the smoothies are delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not really a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory. The cheesecake really is good, and of course their selection can make anyone happy. Their food is reliable, and seems to be pretty consistent across all the franchises so you always know what to expect. I guess I'm just not a fan of the hype. This one is no different, but the location is cool. 

For those of you who don't know, South Side Works is an up-and-coming area just outside of downtown Pittsburgh across the river from Oakland. If you want a good slice of cheesecake, go to Cheesecake Factory. But there are a few other restaurants around the neighborhood, so check those out before dessert."}
{"text":"Our party of 10 had dinner last night and for the most part it was
very enjoyable.  The service was slow and some of the food when
it came out was cold.  Since my husband and I were picking up the 
tab come to find out from our guests only when outside and saying
our goodbyes that it was mentioned by several people. My dish of
Skinny Chicken Pasta was cold and I had to look for my chicken but
decided not to say anything.  Our bill was $360.00 and not objecting 
to that but the kicker was that my husband was celebrating his
Birthday and his cheesecake was supposed to be complimentary.
It came with good wishes on it and some of the staff sang as well.
After reviewing the bill this morning they had charged us for the
Cheesecake .  Kind of puts us off for doing our next celebration 
at the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"oh yeesh. i cant believe i am actually writing a review on a chain. on a chain by the name of cheesecake factory. ok. call me a sucker. call me other dirty names. i can honestly tell you this: i heart the CF. yep. there ya go. i heart it. TLA true love always. 
first of all. i am a girl who loves options. lots o options. keep your options open. i love that the menu is like 1000 pages long. i love that their cheesecake menu is longer then a child's storybook. speaking of cheesecake lets start with the big D. dessert. 
i love the peanut butter cup cheesecake. i love the snickers bar rendition. i have tried the banana and well, i am not a huge banana fan, but even that is good. the other desserts are bigger then texas. like not kidding. portions are their thang here. like a really big thang. you will always have enough for two or three or four depending on your appetites. 
they do offer a skinny licious menu now, which, i mean that is all well and great, but if you are going to go big, just go big. or go the freak home. like why go to the CF if you are going to order skinny? um, not this chick. or i guess you could go skinny and then order one of those HUGE pieces of cheesecake. 
i typically order the same thing every. stinking. time. i. go. 
well there are three menu items. 
appetizer. fried mac n cheese balls. hello. love me some balls. mac n cheese balls that it. oh the crispy outside and cheesy insides.....holy heavenly shizzy. put em on your list. 
entrees:
spicy cashew chicken
chicken and biscuits
bang bang chicken n shrimp and 
i just lately tried a delicious pasta with crispy shrimp and lemon butter sauce. i subbed penne for the linguine, but oh emmmm geee. probably 1500 cals, but again, you ARE at the CF. 
so there ya have it, love doves. get on over the the CF and have yourself some fab treats. just an fyi~ the high tops in the bar are first come first serve. so no waiting. you can hang around like vultures and grab them as they become available. a lot of people do not know this so it makes getting a table rather quick if you have an inside source! :)"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food and service is excellent. But this facility is just entirely too small and poorly laid out. In any business there's a bottle neck and this is it here. This location could benefit from a larger floor plan or a second floor. Anything would be better than what they have now."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has one of the best happy hours ever.. 
You still get to experience their food, which is tasty.. and most of their appetizers and some drinks are about $5 each, which is a great price for me!"}
{"text":"Only took 20 min to get my cold mac cheeseballs, the tase was ok, but being cold sucked. That being said it took 40 mins to get our food, which the server said the manager would be out to see us, which I never asked for, I just wanted my food. It came out,  the chicken was like rubber. Do not get the southwestern chicken sandwich. All their meals are over priced. Not happy. Never going back."}
{"text":"Pumpkin cheesecake is really good. But the to-go bakery orders get messed up every time i come here. I'm talking, for years. Always someone different. It's like they just don't care.  

The last guy was completely apologetic, but not apologetic enough to get a manager to open the locked door after I discovered our strawberries for the strawberry cheesecake (you pay extra for them) were not in our bag. We were in the mall. The mall doors were locked, and we were trying to go back out the door we came in. He made me go outside around to their front door to bring me the strawberries. I'm glad some lady was coming out the mall door and held it for me to go back in, or I'd have had to walk all the way around the mall to my car in the cold w/o my coat or my family, who were way inside and I said I'd be right back.

People must like it despite the high prices, because it's usually packed and there's always a wait if we want to eat here. I've just had bad experiences getting the to-go bakery items."}
{"text":"What's not to love about the Cheesecake Factory? With their menu of choices under 550 calories everyone can find something to love. And who doesn't enjoy cheesecake. Our server was delightful and the meal well paced. A bit pricey depending on what you get but worth it."}
{"text":"Finally a Cheesecake Factory in Canada! It's new, so go on a weekday so you can avoid long wait times. 

We went on a Wednesday evening and we were promptly seated. Our server Marc Anthony was cool and very helpful. Side note: he was an actor from Degrassi lol. Decor was nice inside. 

We ordered the following:
1. Bang bang chicken and shrimp. Rate: 6/10. 
Thai based dish. Plated nicely. Good portioning. Dish was good, lacked some spice & flavour. My dish was made a little more on the sweet side. But overall, was good. Would order again. 

2. Jambalaya. Rate: 5/10. Was expecting more spice, lacked some flavour. Good portioning but was expecting it to be more flavourful. Would not order again. 

3. Oreo cheesecake. Rate: 10/10. BOMB DIGGITY. You will love this. You will order this again."}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich was truly a treat. I don't know how they did it but a a masterpiece"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. In all fairness they were busy. I ordered eggs & bacon with tomatoes. My daughter got ice cream. They brought the ice cream after they served us our meals. I got potatoes and the wrong bread. It took her 15 minutes to get me the tomatoes I ordered. I never got the bread. She even packed extra of the wrong type of bread like I should be grateful. So for 12$ I got 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon. That left me annoyed."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day. It was way over crowded and the service was mediocre. And to top it off I think the cheesecake slices have shrunk."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed .. I was in a hurry I called in a order for two pasta plates I was asked do you want the lunch or dinner portion I said two lunch .. it was close to 3:00 I get there it was real busy but it took 10 mins before they noticed I was there when I get my order it was 1 lg dinner .. I don't even have time to to wait .. and I couldn't even communicate with the girl she didn't speak English and I don't speak Spanish ... just real disappointed is all"}
{"text":"Two words: stuffed mushrooms. 

My  boyfriend and I frequent The Cheesecake Factory and haven't had any bad incidents yet. Well, there was that one time when a creepy guy with those weird Google glasses sat next to us and kept looking over... But there has yet to be a problem with the food or staff. Get there early, though, because sometimes that yummy rye(?) bread is out by the end of the night! It is great. Seriously. Some of the best staff in town. A++"}
{"text":"Let me just say I get so annoyed when my SO suggests to go here because I spend a half hour just trying to read the menu- it is 21 pages. Literally the most frustrating thing about the Factory- even after you decide you immediately wonder if you should have scanned the menu one more time! 

We started off with the crab/artichoke dip with soft baguette slices. It was good, but nowhere near the best crab dip we have had. To their credit it did have a very generous amount of crab!

I always have to have a side salad with my dinner; it's just mandatory for me! I decided on the tossed salad, though I really wanted the Greek salad. For only 6.95, this salad was huge! A bit more than your typical side salad but that's because it's way bigger. Although I would give it 5/5, it was unfortunate that I just couldn't eat it all because I still needed to eat my meal!

I got the Pasta Da Vinci for my entree; I love mushrooms and was excited to see a variety of different types of mushrooms in a pasta dish. The mushrooms were incredible, and the grilled chicken was cooked very well, but the sauce was very bland. It was okay, but nothing spectacular.

My SO enjoyed his dinner; he said the shrimp scampi was one of the best things he's ever eaten! The mashed potatoes were okay, but not very creamy, more lumpy and a bit dry. Some pieces of his steak were cooked perfectly, while others were a bit tough.

All-in-all, with Cheesecake Factory, I just wasn't blown away with the food, especially for the (dinner) price."}
{"text":"I know that this is a Chain Restaurant but .....that is where the negative connotation stops, The food, which there is a million choices ( I think 260 items to be exact) is just prepared outstandingly ! It has been over a year since I have been there and I was at Southpark yesterday and drove by and saw the Valet parking..it looked like it was not too busy so we went in!   I am so glad we did. We had a great waiter, Adam, and he was knowledgeable and friendly. I always get their Tropical Ice tea, it is light and refreshing. We ordered some old favorite appetizers, The Avocado Egg Rolls, Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.  Then the Grilled Artichokes, so delicious and a great aioli! We ordered a great Beet and Goat Cheese salad in a delicious vinegarette! And then for the CHEESECAKE! We had the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecke, heavenly! With a huge flower of Chocolate Ganache on it. I took three pieces home to my family, an Original, A Dulce Caramel, and a Chocolate mousse.  This is not a inexpensive place but so worth every penny. And there is not a better Cheesecake around!  I would say, go  and save room for the Cheesecake but the food is really delicious, so go hungry!"}
{"text":"If you can navigate your way through the thirty page menu, you'll find that they actually have some great offerings at the Cheesecake Factory. Portions are huge, usually amounting to atleast two or three meals for yours truly, so taking that into consideration the prices aren't bad. 

Appetizers are all tasty, and their versatility on the rest of menu is really quite impressive. My favorite two things on the menu are the fish tacos and the orange chicken. They have completely different flavors and creative takes on traditional dishes. 

It's very corporate, and the rumor on the grapevine is that although it's pretty good money, working there is no fun."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here today! Great for families as our toddler was starving and they brought bread and bananas to the table when we sat down & they have a family restroom which was great for diaper changes. Our server, Jennifer P. was phenomenal. The drinks we had were delicious, ultimate margarita and whiskey smash. The tuna tartare appetizer was amazing and our lunch choices were great as well. Overall, awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that its impossible to get any sort of intimate accommodations at a chain restaurant especially one as big as the cheesecake factory. However, from the first five minutes here i found the most courteous and sincere employee here was SKYLER,  the front of house manager. He is attentive, and provides excellent service with a smile and great attitude. He goes above and beyond to ensure that your experience is of the highest caliber and provides way more service than some of the most high end restaurants. Overall the atmosphere was a pleasure and it was mostly so because of his service. I definitely recommend this particular cheesecake to any one that appreciates good service!"}
{"text":"My experience was good. I went two days after opening. Saw the huge line in the mall so opted for takeout (entrance outside). Once in line I saw that half the restaurant was empty - so I proceeded to the counter and asked why they were building a line with so many empty seats inside. 

Was offered a seat at the bar, which I gladly accepted. Total wait time: 2 mins. 

Staff were friendly and helpful. Gave us tips on ordering cheesecake (to go) before we ordered so that it would be ready by the time we were done eating. 

Ordered a bunch of delicious food (see pics). All in all a great 1st experience at the brand new Toronto location. While I don't like a lot of American companies moving into the Canadian space, these guys do it properly so welcome to Canada!"}
{"text":"First time going,  after hearing a new location opened up, and having heard such great things about them in general ,me and my family (6 of us) decided we would finally see for ourselves. Well from the moment we sat down to the moment we left (almost running out the door) we had the most disappointing experience. John M. was our server and came to take our drink order first,  everyone else ordered soft drinks and i ordered a apple cider,  5 minutes later drinks arrived except mine, was told it was coming next,  10 more mins passed was asked if anyone had brought my cider yet and was again told \"right away\" another 5 mins passed before i received my drink only to receive a glass half the size as everyone else's and with no ice at all, (room temperature apple juice). Finally we all put in our orders, 3 of us ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with a mix of chicken and shrimp , after waiting 45 mins we were served. The pasta was already starting to harden, the chicken had no flavor, the shrimp was chewy and the Alfredo sauce was watery, as if the pasta was not strained all the way. At the end 5 of us were very disappointed with our meal and our server noticing our not too pleased faces decided to ask the manager if he could comp 2 desserts. Dessert was the only thumbs up we gave for the night, but even dessert couldn't stop us from wanting to run out of there! I agreed with my sister when she said \"never again!\""}
{"text":"Where to start? Went in after a movie date with my husband. We have been doing Cheesecake Factory for years and never been disappointed until tonight. He order steak Diane, I ordered chicken kaske after an extremely long wait (they were not at all busy) the manager came out to apologies. A longer wait later and the food arrived, COLD, cooked oversee instead of medium and my chicken was DRY.  We did not eat, got a 25.00 bill for our artichoke dip and strawberry martini, left hungry with a piece of free cheesecake..."}
{"text":"cheesecake factory sucks.  first off, get with the program, i'm a forum employee and you guys don't offer mall discounts.  2nd, why my to go order for SOUP took 39 minutes to get to me from the time i called is beyond my explanation, i know you guys didn't make this fresh i know it was sitting in a big vat with maybe just the garnishing put on right before it went out so why the delay?  3rd, why the fuck did my soup come in a coffee cup?  how in the fuck am i supposed to eat this without it getting everywhere?  and not even an apology from the incompetent to go clerk....like it's not abnormal for soup to take 39 minutes to get to a customer.  you guys are lucky i work in the same place and know how much it sucks to get aimlessly bitched at, so i wasn't gonna do that, but you guys suck.  fail in every aspect possible.  never again.  never.  only max brenner and fat tuesday's from now on.  rest assured, my whole staff feels the same way.  only reason we deal with you still is because your soup is only 5 bucks even with your non existent mall employee discount, but unfortunately now it takes 39 minutes to make it on our hour lunches.  never again..."}
{"text":"I don't know how the Cheesecake Factory is only rated 3 stars...it's great. Awesome desserts, great good, amazing egg Benedict breakfast, etc."}
{"text":"I went out to eat with my family tonight to eat at Cheesecake Factory. My family and I often choose to go here when we do go out. This location is always busy. I highly recommend to get there early if you have big groups. We were only four people and waited 10-20 minutes. You have the option of sitting inside, outside, or whatever is first available. We chose to sit inside.

Once seated, our server, Nathan, came by with waters and bread. The bread basket consisted of sourdough bread, a wheat bread, and white bread. I ordered a raspberry lemonade and it was pretty good. I definitely like the strawberry one better but it's not bad if you want to try something new.

My family and I ordered the avocado egg rolls as our appetizer being that it's our favorite whenever we come. It was perfectly fried and the avocados inside were delicious and ripe.

I chose to order a new dish tonight so I went for the farfalle pasta with chicken and roasted garlic. I'm a huge fan of bow tie pasta so I had to try it. Once I received it though I was a bit underwhelmed. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the chicken was okay. They also left huge chunks of garlic in the pasta so if you're not a garlic fan, ask for it without it. The pasta wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't the best I've had there. I feel like I've had better farfalle at other restaurants. Besides the pasta, everything relate else was great.  

We ordered dessert to go (red velvet cheesecake and cherry cheesecake). Red velvet is THE best! It's part cake and part cheesecake--perfect combo! 

Our server Nathan was awesome and made sure we were always taken care of during dinner. It made the experience much more enjoyable. I will be coming back for sure because I just love Cheesecake Factory :)"}
{"text":"So living in the Glendale area I have now given this Cheesecake Factory two chances
I'm a sucker for Cheesecake Factory.. I love eating at cheesecake factory I love their food I love their bread and especially the cheesecakes 
But for some reason this location has now disappointed me twice. Total bummer bc well my fiancé and our kids love coming here a.k.a. they love the bread lol! 
So we first went to this location two weeks ago.. We were a huge party of 10 which was fine  you know it was dinner time no complaints on our waiter...
I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps or as they call them lettuce tacos. Nothing taco about only taco thing was it came out in the weird taco holder stand..this is where I don't understand what happen I ordered chicken lettuce wraps I would expect there to be chicken in my lettuce wrap not one little sliver of chicken probably 1 inch long I want chicken I'm hungry! So already I'm disappointed.
We came back here the other night and our kids food(they get the kids pizza) was fine my fiancé's food was phenomenal(he usually gets the steak or salmon) and my food again not so great. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which I've ordered at other Cheesecake factory's and I've never had this issue that my chicken crusted Parmesan was soggy. Usually it's thin crispy not this one soggy like it was old and warmed up ...
Crazy part is I know not to order those items again bc I know we will be back... Just I know for next time..
Anyway I still love Cheesecake Factory..
Just beware of soggy chicken lol"}
{"text":"I came here several years ago and had my only poor experience at a Cheesecake Factory.  I thought maybe it was just that I didn't order the proper items.  Over the years, I have learned what I like here and so as to properly rate, I ordered those items:

Buffalo Blasts
Classic Burger with Cheese (plain)

First and foremost, the service was poor.  There are a bunch of \"Wanna Be\" GUPPIES that work at this place and they have that certain mentality where everything smells of roses.  This transferred from Host to Servers to Runners.  I am trying to understand why the Runners were so arrogant.  Have you ever seen a trash man get a snooty/snotty arrogance when he talks about his job?  Oh to see the day.  

The server finally took our order after several minutes of waiting.  The buffalo blasts arrived and they were good.  Just as I remember them from every other Cheesecake Factore.  They are basically an empanada (or meat pie) filled with shredded chicken, cheese and some buffalo sauce.  There is some additional buffalo sauce on the side and some peppered blue cheese dressing brought along for dipping.  Yes, this was good.  It was the highlight of this meal.

Our cheeseburger arrived.  I don't know what they did, but the flavor was off; it tasted as though they had saturated the bun in mayonaise or butter and then put it on the grill and then put additional fat on the hamburger patty.  I ate it, but I was less than thrilled with what was in front of me.

I could have given this restaurant a 3 for the Buffalo Blasts alone, but the GUPPIES just ruined it for me.  I doubt they have ever lived in a true urban setting...pompous mules."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is awesome for....cheesecake. Overrated for anything else.

As Shonda Rhimes once said, \"Cheesecake will always taste like love\". There are so many varieties of cheesecake, so little time. Each piece is ginormous. 

The food menu is boring. On this recent visit,  I had a veggie omelet with country potatoes. I asked fo no onions in the omelet. One could reasonably infer that I would want to know if my potatoes were mostly onion, and less potato. Alas, I picked out onions for a good 5 minutes. The meal was relatively bland. I asked for salsa, and the server recommended the tomatillo salsa, which she said had a kick. Perfect. It needed a kick,  because it sure didn't have one.  It was like blended onions with cilantro. Clearly my favorite, as you have read. I couldn't even taste the tomatillo, and it needed salt. My hot chocolate, however, was tops. Chocolate and whipped cream can never really NOT be good, can it?

My husband had the lemon ricotta pancakes, with a side of bacon. He really enjoyed both. However, you really did need to use the syrup on the pancakes, because they were not at all sweet.

For the $50 bill for two,  I would have rather spent that money at a local eatery that cares about their food. I was glad that we had a gift card."}
{"text":"Don't come here with a dairy allergy. They acted accommodating, but I am now home very sick. They had no allergy print out, which is common so whatever, but I worked hard then with a lot of questions about what I could eat since they were unprepared for lactose allergies. Finally, I ordered the salmon salad, and I could tell there was some sort of butter on the salmon. They sent it back to the kitchen and came back saying it's just mustard and that the kitchen is aware of my allergy. I am now very sick so clearly there was an issue here."}
{"text":"I had gotten a Gift Card for Christmas that I finally decided to use. 

I really had mixed feelings about going based on some past experiences and all the kitchen drama that you may or may not have heard of. (google it) 

Regardless of that though we had a really good experience this time. 

Our waiter Hoki was wonderful, service was A+. I would advise requesting his section if you ever eat here. 

Their Passion fruit Ice Tea is delicious and our glasses never emptied and were always refreshed with ice on each refill. 

I ordered the Grilled Salmon from the fresh fish selection, it came with Steamed Broccoli and rice. (see pics) It was really good, the Salmon was cooked perfectly. Something I Would definitely order again. 

The Mr. Ordered the Boston House Salad (see pics) I shared a few bites and also enjoyed it. His entree was the Four Cheese Pasta which he really liked too, sorry no pic. 

For dessert we Shared a slice of the Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake (see pics). WOW! That was sinfully good! 


Our service and experience based on today's visit is worthy of 4 stars
( Hoki deserves 5) but an average rating based on all my visits combined I'll go with 3 stars."}
{"text":"Called last Thursday a To-Go Curbside order. The man who took my order was very cordial, let me know they had gotten pretty busy already. I got to the parking lot and the curbside attendant was getting someone's card and before I could even call them she came to my car for my payment because she already knew my order was packed up. Prompt polite service, food was delicious, and will be back to try a different cheesecake this week! (:

Also I am kind of a salad freak- many places like Olive Garden and Chili's have that out-of-a-can dressing taste where there's either not enough or too much but CF has their Caesar salad down PERFECTLY. I'm not even a crouton person but whatever they use is amazing."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's just us but the place has an odd smell that my wife can't stand so sat outside.  Food was OK (Scottsdale CF much better) service was good, greeter could have been a bit more friendly - didn't feel very welcome especially when we asked to sit outside"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time-not a typical place we would eat-because we heard they had good vegetarian options. We ordered avocado toast and the vegan Cobb salad to split. I asked for no onions.  

When our order came it looked a bit messy, and the avocado was very brown, but we were hopeful it would taste good. Not the case, the avocado on the toast was full of onions and the salad was not very fresh tasting.

I did call to the attention of our waitress that it was extremely oniony and we did not eat it.  She did try to make it right, Which is why I gave 3 stars.  They took it off our bill and did apologize.   But not a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, food is great! I've been here plenty of times and always forget to check in and leave a review. I always enjoy coming here because there's something for everyone on the menu!"}
{"text":"Got to visit the store at the Premium Outlets North location for our Christmas lunch. It was very nice, but definitely a bit overpriced. I was glad I wasn't paying! I got the bacon, bacon cheeseburger, which was pretty good. I also got a side salad, which was ok. I'll probably only go back for dessert."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a medium size group. 6 people. Service was great. Waitress was very attentive and smiled. Food was really good. 3 of the group had never been before to Cheesecake Factory .We wil be back! Great stuff !"}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory, and I just discovered their amazing happy hour. For around $5.50 you can get a regular sized appetizer in the bar. It's a nice alternative to $20+ meal you would normally pay if you were dining in for dinner. I like the atmosphere. Occasionally my husband will call in car side to go - and the order is perfect every time!"}
{"text":"I love the cheesecakes here - my favorite is the Dulce de Leche!! The food is okay. I just wish there were more vegetarian options, so I can join my friends when they eat here."}
{"text":"Incredible meal and service! The seared ahi tuna on brown rice was incredible, can't wait to  order it again"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome , we were seated right away , the menu is gigantic, so many different varieties, I got the Cuban sandwich and it was huge and the taste was wonderful, I also got a side of jalapeño cream cheese corn , the flavors are a great mix. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went here the first night I moved to Las Vegas. It's located next to the Boca Park shopping center, which has a plethora of nice shops there.

Our food was out extremely quickly. The quality is pretty on par with the rest of this franchise's restaurants- fast, chain food, a menu too large for any one item to be really excellent, but good enough.

they have a large outdoor seating area complete with over the head mist so that you can stay cool during this warm winter months.

overall, my experience was good. I do love eating here because it's a great place for the entire family, and the food is descent."}
{"text":"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh many times and loved it. I came here looking for the same experience, and was quite surprised. We came on a Tuesday evening and we only waited about 5 minutes, which was nice. I ordered the shrimp angel hair, and my boyfriend got the chicken Alfredo. The shrimp was so overcooked that I couldn't eat it. The chicken on his was also very overcooked and the entire dish was flavorless. Very disappointed. If you are going to go here, save your money and go to the Pittsburgh location instead."}
{"text":"Pecan pumpkin cheesecake is good but I prefer the regular pumpkin cheesecake! The chicken Bellagio is amazing but big enough for 3-4 meals. Seriously my new fav! We ordered the sangria and the cucumber mojito, the bartender was off his game tonight. Our drinks were so sloppy and soaked on the bottom of the glass."}
{"text":"Drove 45 minutes one way on Sunday, March 5th for brunch, only to find the restaurant was closed for some unexplained reason. Sign on the door said they hoped to be open later in the afternoon. Nothing on the website or Facebook page indicated they would not be open. Such a disappointment and waste of time (and money!). Probably won't make the drive again any time soon. In this day and age, your website and social media should reflect current hours of operation."}
{"text":"5 of us came to CF for my daughter's bday.  I just have to say I'm so not impressed with this restaurant anymore.  Way overpriced for a absolutely tasteless entree...supposed to be a basil chicken dish with basil pasta.  There was NO basil pasta and a couple of pieces of basil in the garnish.  It was tasteless and lifeless. Then they are so cheap that they can't even give a slice of cheesecake for the bday girl...it was literally a half of a scoop of ice cream and two tablespoons of whipped cream.  We'll definitely pick somewhere that appreciates the business more for our next celebration."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake for PICK UP. I was fine paying $16 for 2 pieces as I remembered they are a decent size. However, this were TINY PIECES OF CHEESECAKE. So not only are they expensive, but they are smaller in size.  Never ordering cheesecake from there again."}
{"text":"Well it's a chain...but as far as chains go, it's a better one. The menu is a little overwhelming. There's about 15 items on each page and it's probably 8 pages. Review for each item ordered:

Potato tot appetizer - great
Crab wontons - great. Actually crab in them. Many times I get these and they are more cream
Cheese. I like them both ways but call it out in case you don't like the crabby kind.

One of the party had steak and mashed potatoes. She loved the steak, cooked exactly as ordered. Mashed potatoes were stiff though tasted ok.

Another had orange chicken. Good portion size.

The street steak tacos were great. Get the sauces on side.

Bistro shrimp was way too salty. I don't know if it was the extra Parmesan cheese I put on or an accident. I don't recall it being that way 2 years ago.

Cheesecake is divine. Prices about $1-2 over. They could be more competitive. My friend said they used to have pad Thai that was really good but I didn't see it listed. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I love eating here. The menu has so many options to fulfill what you are in the mood for. Deserts of couse are excellent and should be given the name. Only problem I always seem to encounter is just how slow the service always is. Just never seems to be enough staff to cover the need. Weekends always has a line out the door which unfortunately is common around here. I'd love to eat there more often but I do not wish to spend hours to do it."}
{"text":"Delicious meal. Came here with my girlfriend and we had an amazing time. Very classy, friendly people, they make sure you feel welcome and respected from the time you enter to when you leave. Because of their delicious food and classy staff, they're very busy. I would suggest a reservation if you don't want to have a long wait. They have a wide variety of cheesecakes and are so delicious."}
{"text":"The 2-star is for their food, not their service. I don't have much to complain about the service, this is not fine dining so you def shouldn't expect a fine dining experience... I've been a Cheesecake Factory fan since I was 18... I'm so familiar with their menu and how the food should taste because I always order the same things every time. I ordered shrimp scampi and steak Diane today as usual, the presentation was horrible. Steak was over cooked and fries were soggy. I've never been disappointed in my food in CCF but today was a first. I don't recommend coming here, maybe try a different location."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE experience from the general manager of the restaurant. Even after I have notified her that the food was lousy, my wife got stomachache from their food. 
I have contacted the corporate office and they did not do anything about it, I have tried to reach out to the regional manager and he never tried to call me , nothing. 
After my wife got food poisoning from this location at Green Valley, I went back to the restaurant to speak with a general manager and she refused to speak with me. 
I can't believe how Cheesecake Factory treats their loyal customers, we have been coming to this location for years and brought so many friends there and they did not care about that a bit. 
We will definitely never ever return to the Cheesecake Factory again, I will rather go somewhere else and spend my money,where I will be appreciated as a loyal customer ."}
{"text":"This is a decent, affordable restaurant.  Every time I visit I have try the passion iced tea and one of the small plate appetizers that range from $4 - $6. they are the perfect portion and price. The restaurant could be better, though.  Having to wait for a table, and then wait another 10 -15 minutes next to the hostess podium to be sat is odd.  The portions are friggin huge, and while they dont charge a fee to share entrees, the chefs will not split the entrees for you, the way they will at Bravo.  The server will hand you another plate and a serving spoon - there ya go, have at it! Charging $7 - $9 for a piece of cheesecake is robbery given that the cheesecake is just defrosted from a cardboard box.  The atmosphere is ugly and outdated, and I always look up to wonder if one of those cone-shaped fixtures is about to fall and impale me.  The service staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and you can definitely find something on the menu to rave about."}
{"text":"We basically went to the Cheesecake Factory because we are addicted to two things: cheesecake and Big Bang Theory.

What a surprise! Not only you get an amazing choice of cheesecakes (and cakes in general) which are just delicious... but also the food is great! I've tried the Smokehouse BBQ Burger twice and I have to admit it was one of the best I've ever had and better than the one I had at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR the day before.

Definitely recommended (it's also non-expensive), but remember to show up early (or late) for dinner as the place is always packed!"}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant but EVERY ONE of these places has good food, great service and an extensive menu (good for big parties/bad for indecisive people). Their desserts are AMAZING and IF you can finish your meal, then go for their signature cakes. Simply amazing is the best way to describe their cheesecakes and other savory cakes. If I did have a complaint (besides the extensive menu which can be daunting to some) it would be that this place is usually a bit noisy, but it's also huge and often full of customers, both good signs. Try it for yourself, and then make your own decision. I've tried everything from (chicken) sliders, burgers, pasta, steak, grilled chicken and seafood."}
{"text":"Always busy, always consistent.  Their menu amazes me.  I don't know how one restaurant can feel comfortable having a 20+ page menu spanning so many types of cuisine.  At my most recent visit, the bread, as always, is delightful.  I like the wheat bread that is soft and slightly sweet.  The sourdough is also a favorite, though I'm not a fan of any sourdough really.  My mom and I split the Cuban sandwich, which was my favorite menu item.  The ham, pulled pork, pickle and mustard just get along amazingly well.  The portions are HUGE, so definitely plan on splitting so you leave room for the best part, dessert!  Again, dessert is huge so either split, or a better idea, order it all for you and take some home for later!  I've tried many a cheesecake there, but my favorite is the original or the strawberry.  All cheesecake, less foo-foo stuff.

The décor is over the top, but intentionally so.  The servers are always welcoming and helpful when it comes to deciding the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat at nice people great restaurants great location and nice area great environment tasty food"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. Biscuits were dry and cold also burnt on the bottom. The meatloaf was also burnt like it was recooked and drinks were not satisfactory. In efforts to have orders corrected our waitress copped an attitude because our table wasn't satisfied. We were visiting from Pittsburgh and this would have never been acceptable there or anywhere else. Needless to say we will not be back to this South Park location."}
{"text":"My sister and I took her boyfriend for his birthday dinner, the appetizer quesadilla were amazing. I ordered the Sheila salad I believe it's called, it said chicken, avocado, tortilla chips and peanuts. Yum. When I got it, no avocado or tortilla chips. I picked through, looked, told my server, she then looked puzzled and came back with tiny bowls of avocado and chips. I tried to make it work, maybe took two bites, told her I wasn't happy with it, still on the bill and still paid the $15.

Birthday time. I had told a manager about the birthday, server handed him the menu, he selected which slice, the sang happy birthday, then charged for the cake.

I'm a server, it's hard to even write a bad review for me, but that service was just not how guest should be treated. I shouldn't have had to remake my salad when there was an error. And I've never been to a place where they charge for birthday desserts."}
{"text":"The chain is great.   Cheesecake factory has a HUGE menu and prides itself on creating an amazing environment full of space. 

This location (Green Valley) is really hit-or-miss from a service perspective.   If you are looking for something to eat around this area take the safe bet and go to Elephant Bar or PF Changs.   

I have had servers at this location be real rockstars and then I have had folks who realllllllly seemed like they hated to be at work.   When you are spending almost $100 on a meal for you family you expect at least marginal service."}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience at this restaurant. Tonight was not one of those nights. I ordered the chicken marsala dish for dinner, and when I received it it tasted absolutely like nothing at all. When I am from the waiter that my meal was unsatisfactory, he offered just to take it off the bill or if I wanted to wait another 20 minutes or more for a meal. At no time did any manager come over to apologize for the inconvenience or the fact that I had to share my wife's dinner since we were with another couple I do not want them to have to wait.  I just thought that was very unprofessional, and it really made me take another look at other options in the near future."}
{"text":"FOOD WAS pretty GOOD and kind of had Italian modern inside decour. Menu is huge with something for everyone to prob like, including a recent light fare menu. nice mood lighting and service was ok. MY COMPLAINT WAS WITH THE CHEESECAKE. not the best cheesecake, yes there's variety but not noteworthy. It has nothing on NY cheesecake or homemade. If you're called the cheesecake factory you better have damn good cheesecake."}
{"text":"I live in Las Vegas, and being at The forum shops is last on my list, but since my daughter works in one of the fashion outlets, I pick and drop her off quite often, one day I decide to hit up The Cheesecake Factory, with it's long list of customers waiting to dine, if you don't mind eating at the bar, then there is absolutely no waiting! And the service was fast and the bartender was very pleasant and attentive. I work in a fine dinning restaurant with great food, but this one appetizer dish I tried along with the lunch portion Chinese Chicken salad was to die for! The Avocado egg rolls were delicious!!!!!! They have sun dried tomato and plenty avocado in them, and to go along with it, is the sweet cilantro dipping sauce. So far I've gone there 3 times in the last month in a half. This is a must try, if you don't eat meat and love avocados. Of course they have a long list of different cheesecakes, I always stick to strawberry cheesecake. Yum!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were seated quickly. Unfortunately no one even acknowledged us for over 10 minutes once seated. The speedy seating and the fact that this was a Monday evening made this unacceptable. The tables adjacent were visited at least twice. So... We left. Try harder people."}
{"text":"We're returning customers who just left dinner from here, but today our experience was extra incredible!!! Our waiter was Tevin, and he went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed.  Our waters were never less than half empty, and he continuously made sure he was doing everything he could to make sure our experience was great.  On top of the great service and great food, other workers just looked so happy and created an even better ambiance! We had a great time sharing a meal here, and are so thankful for the staff of Cheesecake Factory who helped make it so wonderful for us! Our time was too great to not leave this review and recognize those incredible people."}
{"text":"Just left this location and I feel the need to Yelp it right away. We were a party of 4, sat right away at 5:15pm and ordered at 5:20pm. So far so good, right? My food comes out (burger undercooked with onions on it and I said NO onions). I flag down the server, she takes it away. 15 min later, still no burger so I ask where is my food? Server tells me the kitchen ran out of burger patties and they are making more. Huh? Ok, whatever. 25 min goes by and I ask for a manager. Still no food. Manager (Robert) strolls over and says I will take burger iff the bill. And asks if there is anything else he can do? I said, well, I have been here for almost 1 hour and havent eaten anything. He offers me a piece of cheesecake and says \"I will go get it right away\". 10 min later, no manager, no cheesecake. We get up to leave, and the server asks if we got the cake? I said NO and the manager must have forgot. She turns and literally runs to the takeout area and gets my cake and comes back and 60 seconds. I ask for the GM of this location and she says the GM will be there on Wed. So, on Wed I will call this GM (Amy) and tell her to read this Yelp review. Its unfortunate that restaurants like Cheesecake Factory allow this to happen. I have always held them to a higher standard, but looks like they have some work to do. The manager, Robert was so nonchalant and obviously didnt care much about \"being right back\" with my cheesecake. Unteal. My grade: F"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain and acts just like one. You are in Las Vegas. Have some great food, have some cheap food, have a hot dog. Don't go here.
It is packed. The lines are long. It is loud. The menu is huge, which is nice, but really, don't bother.
The service is fair, the food is fine, the prices too high for what you get and you get more than you need. 
There are so many places to eat that you may not have a chance to dine at again. Go to one of those. The CheeseCake Factory is boring and not worth your time."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Cheesecake Factory.  You are going to find an extensive menu and you'll have to decide what you are in the mood to eat.

Depending on the day and time, you may have a wait.  Attempted to go here on a discount cheesecake night and the expected wait was 45 minutes to an hour.  I'm not sure how long it was because we bailed after 20 minutes.

Back to the last time my family and I ate here this past week.  The food looks amazing.  (See my pictures). The taste is OK.  The side salad was supposed to have balsamic dressing and I tasted none, so I left it.  The chicken salad sandwich is delicious!  Should have gotten the full size instead of the lunch special, as the soup was also only OK.

The men in my family enjoyed their burgers, which was big enough for my teen to also have for dinner.  Daughter liked, not loved, her grilled cheese."}
{"text":"When I am in the area, I like to frequent this Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I always try to go early or late, but never right at noon. This location is nestled between plenty of office buildings and if you go right at noon, there will surely be a wait. 

Today I got the same great food and service! After glancing at the novel-sized menu and wrestling in my mind what to have... I had my usual: the shrimp and bacon club sandwich. I always order mine without the middle slice of bread. There are few reasons why I do this: 1. I can't fit the double decker sandwich in my mouth 2. it makes the sandwich more packed full of shrimp and bacon! 3. Less calories - which I guess makes up for the bacon and fries I had! All in all the sandwich was delish! They have a new nifty metal fry holder that kept my fries hot, too!"}
{"text":"I always feel like the food is pretty average for their prices, but they are pretty good portions. Service for todays lunch was quick, we were told a 20 minute wait to be seated but it was more like 5. Our waitress was very attentive, no complaints there. We ordered the artichoke spinach dip for an appetizer, the dip itself was OK, the tortilla chips were a little stale for my taste. My daughter ordered the fish tacos tempura battered, she asked for hard tacos but got soft corn. I had the chicken piccata lunch portion, chicken was tender and still plenty of food for the lunch menu. We were stuffed but still ordered a slice of salted caramel cheesecake to go. I'm sure that's delicious, when is cheesecake not awesome? Almost $80 for lunch is a good reminder why I hardly ever come here though."}
{"text":"I took my two boys here for lunch and and we were completely satisfied with everything we ordered. My two boys ages 12 and 10 were treated like young adults. I can't wait until we can eat there again."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect restaurant for any occasion and when you're craving good food. Their menu consists of a wide range of soups, salads, pastas, drink specials, seafood, and much more!

I was immediately greeted as soon as I walked through the door and seated shortly after. 

I had the Fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer which was delicious! If you love macaroni and cheese as much I do, this appetizer will not disappoint you. The Fried Macaroni and Cheese is made of 4 macaroni and cheese balls fried on the outside and cheesy on the inside. The macaroni tastes great with the creamy marinara sauce that it is served with and also goes well with the complimentary bread. 

Any visit to the Cheesecake Factory demands a slice of any of their specially made cheesecakes for dessert. My favorite has always been their red velvet cheesecake but I decided to try something different an go with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. My tastebuds were not disappointed when it arrived at our table as it had creamy cheesecake, chocolate chips, and warm chewy cookie dough bits baked in the middle. If you like chocolate and cookies, this cheesecake is definitely worth a try!!

This location can get crowded around lunch and dinner time so try to arrive before noon for lunch and before 6pm for dinner."}
{"text":"First timer the hostesses were STUPID told us 15 min waited 40 told us our table was being bussed sat 4 other people. Almost walked out, dinner was awesome- waitress kathia saved the day."}
{"text":"The only reason i came here again is my girlfriends son likes this place forcsome reason. But the food is nothing more then high priced bar food out of a frozen package!! I know for a fact their are no chefs behind in the kitchen dishing out this garbage!! Because thats what it tastes like!! I ordered the cuban sandwiches which i know came out of a box and heated in microwave, the food is HORRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"4.5! Yes they lost half a star on the buzzer line up! 
CHEESECAKE FACTORY HAS MADE ITS MARK ON CANADIAN SOIL! It's about damn time!

First off...yes! There's obviously a line up. Came here on a Wednesday night and I couldn't believe the line up that formed just to get a buzzer! Almost an hour wait for it but once you get the buzzer and they tell you how long the wait will be... you are free to roam the mall but know that your buzzer signal won't reach that far to let you know that your table is ready. The hostess told us 60-80 mins, be here 10 mins before to ensure you get buzzed in.

After shopping and going around, we came 10 mins earlier and they buzzed us in 5 mins. They sat us in and we immediately ordered. The decor and ambiance looks the same as any Cheesecake Factory restaurant which is great! The server was great and friendly, the bread and butter tasted amazing (my fave part). 

We ordered the buffalo blasts, very HEFTY portion! This lasted till my lunch the next day. I ordered their special for the day which is a Thai glazed salmon and my fiancé got the Louisiana chicken pasta. Both were really amazingly done dishes but I was a big fan of their salmon! It was sooooo jam packed with flavour! 

I love Cheesecake Factory for their food and less for their cheesecake, a little to heavy for me but when I do order a cheesecake to share, my faves are red velvet and the fresh strawberry original cheesecake! But that night we ordered strawberry shortcake sooooooooooo gooooood! 

Amazing way to be the meal! Cheesecake Factory prices are fair to be honest, it's obviously in CAD dollars so it's a bit pricey but you really can't knock it down because of their hefty portions! 

Obviously it's going to be a long time till the crowd dies down which is obvious, but I'll gladly wait again just to eat their food. There is also a huge for take out! Cheesecake Factory will always have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory was a huge disappointment. I really believe that they should not sell food. Cheesecake? Yes. Food? No. First of all they are overpriced. Paying more than 17 dollars for an inedible fish and chips felt like I was being robbed. The appetizers were mediocre but at least edible. The Cuban sandwich tasted OK, however I would just call it a simple ham and cheese sandwich. And honestly why would I want to pay 15 dollars for that? Their signature  brown bread was delicious and our server Sydney saved the day with her professionalism and efficiency. Actually she earned all the stars. And no, we won't go back."}
{"text":"As always, the food is great. However, the service is deteriorating. For the Boca Park location, it's not a good look and definitely not expected. The rude bartender (a somewhat aged blonde female who wears her hair pulled back in a ponytail) was absolutely a HORRIBLE reflection of this particular location. She never ONCE asked us if everything was okay, if our food was how we ordered, if we needed anything, etc. she served the people around us, avoiding us. I had to slam the plastic ketchup container on the counter to get her attention. She stood in front of us numerous times making drinks and never once said i word. Seriously, if you don't like the job, find another one! She was the same exact way the previous time we went there and unfortunately had her. There were two guys at the end of the bar who were loudly complaining about something as well. I voiced my complaint to the manager, but somehow I wasn't convinced this issue will be addressed. A lot of these servers have the mentality of who they \"think\" will and will not tip. Well I have news for the ones who think that way: YOU'RE the one messing up YOUR money, not the client. I definitely laugh at the ones who THINK they deserve a tip no matter how they performed. Well I definitely have a tip for them: don't walk in dark alleyways at night.  If you can, steer clear of this particular bartender. She's not a professional at all and if these are the type of people that CCF will employ, you're better off eating at Red Robin."}
{"text":"Came for lunch after a long hike on the cholla trail of camelback mountain. We were so parched and our thirst was adequately satiated by their sweet and flavourful lemonades (free refills). Hubby and I shared the antioxidant salad and the half portion was perfect for me for lunch. Hubby and son shared the sliders (4 sliders per order) and the potstickers. That was just enough to satisfy them enough in order to share a piece of white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. Everyone was happy with our food and drinks. The restaurant was not crowded as we arrived around 1:30 on a Wednesday. The restaurant and washrooms were clean and the server was friendly and attentive. We can always count on the Cheesecake Factory for a satisfying meal and I like that they offer healthy options. For gf, vegan dessert you can order a bowl of strawberries. The bill was $60.47 for the 3 of us pre tip."}
{"text":"We went here with a large group for my brother-in-law's birthday. We arrived around 1:30 & left around 4.

I walked in the hostess desk had just cleared of customers and the one hostess did not ask what I needed, I was ignored. Two groups came through the mall entrance and she spoke with them.

A woman customer behind me asked if I had been helped and I replied no. A minute later another hostess arrived and offered to help me, then a third hostess arrived and seemed puzzled.

It appeared no one but us was waiting, after 50 or more minutes of waiting we were seated. Drink orders were taken promptly, alcohol arrived first, water took 5 minutes, soda, coffee, and tea arrived 20 minutes after sitting. Tables were small 2-4 top tables. 

The server did not ask of we were ready to order, she rushed off. There was a lot of waiting.

The portions were very large. 

The Childrens Mac and cheese should have included a smaller portion of noodles & a large side of veggies. It needed less salt, no parmesan cheese, and no cheese chunks inside the noodles. This child whose favorite order is Mac could not stomach the mac. (Win for mom, got to share some delicious salmon, rice, and broccoli)

The kids mini corn dogs arrived with 3 corn dogs and an adult portion of extra salty fries. The corn dogs dos not classify as mini they were shorter and fatter but the same amount of food as one normal corn dog. The dog inside was greasy, and disgusting but 2 of the 3 were eaten by the child who ordered.

My sister and I both selected salmon from the lunch menu, priced about $15. My sister chose the herb crusted, accompanied by mashed potatoes and 4 sprigs of asparagus. The salmon which looked like a patty was on a mountain of mashed potatoes. She enjoyed the salmon, the rest was okay.

My grilled salmon lunch portion had an accompaniment of mashed potatoes and broccoli. The potatoes could be traded out for brown rice, the veggies could be replaced for an up-charge. The platter it arrived on was full, half or more of rice 4-6 servings of rice. Less than a full serving of broccoli unlike the asparagus I received more than 4 flowerettes. And a good size, well seasoned salmon steak. I enjoyed the cooked broccoli and brown rice. For information purposes  it was not seasoned at all.

My brother-in-law orders the Philly cheese steak & fries finishing half. 

My father ordered the Cobb salad which should be equal portions of different toppings. It was a shredded lettuce salad with some tomato, some cheese, a few scraps of meat, and a chunk of avocado. They state tossed but they do not state the ingredient portions aren't equal. -not a Cobb salad.

My uncle ordered the jambalaya which was in a very large dish as well. The flavors were great, a bit of a bite to it. My one complaint is that I didn't expect it to have oil in it. Everything in the dish was covered with an oily film.

The lemon drop Martini was addictive 

The regular coffee was good, I wouldn't visit for the coffee though.

The decaf coffee was quite bitter, it's flavor was a bit unpleasant.

I could only drink the water after eating, it had an aroma of chlorine and tasted odd.

Some flavors were spot on, portions were odd, ingredients were odd. Salmon & mashed potatoes for lunch. 4 sprigs of asparagus. Jambalaya in oil. Cobb salad 90% shredded lettuce. Kids mac loaded in cheddar, parmesan, and added salt with no veggie. 3 giant kids \"mini\" corn dogs with an adult sized fry no veggie option. Half a plate of rice.
 
We requested one Childrens Hot fudge sundae which was, not brought out, then after the bill was given we had a sad kiddo, requested it again as the bill was being paid, when it arrived it was enough for 2-3 children. Loaded with whipped cream.

Lots of waiting. Food was placed in front of the wrong people (by people helping our server)

The server was well informed of the menu and options and pleasant. More pleasant than the 3 hostesses. 

**Three stars because if I were eating anything but my meal I would have been disappointed. But my food was good and the server was pleasant and able to answer my questions. This helped me receive something satisfying for my taste.**"}
{"text":"So this review was just because of national cheesecake day.  So every year they do half off cheesecakes,  we'll you would think they would be prepared for this day way in advance and make sure they have enough staff to get this process efficiently.  We got there and people had no idea where the kine was or where people were waiting or where to go to get in the restaurant.  Then it took about 20 mins to order.  So we were excited that it wasn't too bad because of all the confusion.  But then we waited and waited and waited...  It took 50 more minutes before we even got our cheesecake.  People who ordered after us were getting there cheesecakes before us and there was no organization to the process at all.  You would think they could have just kept pieces of cheesecake already in the boxes so they could give it to people immediately.  

Sorry this review doesn't completely reflect the whole restaraunt because we didn't even eat there so I can not talk about their service at all.  So I don't want this to reflect them Completely...  But I just wanted to let people know not to go on busy days like that!!"}
{"text":"went here two days in a row with my friends while spending the weekend in Vegas, sort of got dragged along the 2nd time.  Honestly, their food is decent, but too plain in my opinion, I wasn't wowed by anything.

  The first time I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, which was tasty, but again, nothing crazy.  Second time I had pasta with meat sauce, maybe my fault fault for not ordering something more exotic, but again nothing I couldn'tve made at home.  The meals are at least affordable.  And while their HUUUGE portions could be a plus for some people, I really think they should scale them down a bit.  Seriously, we were a party of 9, and I think the food we didn't finish could've fed a company of soldiers for a day.  And we ordered one entree each with two or three appetizers to share.  

One last thing that made me give them 3 stars was that a buddy of mine ordered Eggs Benedict, and the thing came drenched in Hollandaise sauce.  Literally, you couldn't see what was underneath.  

Anyways, just like the rating says, A-OK, but I wouldn't go there again with everything else that Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. The strawberry lemonade has a lot of sugar in it. The sugar is even around the glass. The speed from ordering to having lunch is very slow. The waitress said it takes about 20-25 minutes to get the food.

Btw, I was just told my pizza was burned and they will cook another pizza for me!"}
{"text":"Experience was okay. Long wait and the staff really didn't seem to care.  Had issue with my drink and waitress questioned me about it.  I am not carrying dead flies in my pocket."}
{"text":"This is a large restaurant located in the South Park mall. They are always busy or crowded it appears and there is always a wait which can range from
 15 minutes to 3 hours. They have valet service and you can skip the dinning experience and order to go or desserts at the counter in the front. 

I was able to dine one evening when they had the 15 minute wait time. Our buzzer went off and we were seated. The buzzer was greasy. I had hand sanitizer so I was okay. Not sure if it was wiped off between patrons in this flu season. Prior to being seated I had time to review the menu and use the restroom. The restrooms were semi clean. With the high percentage of guests they can clean more often. 

I placed my drink order upon being sat. For some odd reason I reminded my waiter twice about my drink order. He totally forgot it appeared. He seemed distracted. The table beside me had the same issue. The service just was non existent. Unfortunately service can make or break an experience.  

The menu was hilarious from glamburgers to skinnylicious. Someone who has an extra personality made this menu.  I had the grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The food was good. The salmon was a bit salty, but there was plenty to take home. The texture and temperature of my dish were great. I had the strawberry martini which was sweet and designed in a cute style. I had two meals due to the large portion size of the salmon dish. I decided to skip dessert. I was so full from dinner over eating wasn't in my plans. There was some dessert options I will come back to try, maybe to go. 

I am all to familiar with cheesecake, but got a chance to try the \"Queen city\" location. I have a theory they get business because of the name. I hope they can grow on so many aspects."}
{"text":"Great food and selection, can't go wrong here.  The food has been good every single time and the service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Shopping in Chandler AZ and stopped for a salad and martini. I'm upset that they no longer have the fresh kale salad on the menu! Boo!!!!!  That was the best Kale Salad ever! Why Cheesecake Cake Factory? Why!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice waiters, yummy food. Sooo many choices for food."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the hostess staff. Saturday evening went with the expectation that there would be a wait, which there was. Hostess informed that the wait was 35 minutes. We stayed because that didn't seem unreasonable. 50 minutes had gone by and we went to check to see how much longer as my kids were getting restless. The hostess advised that they were cleaning our table and said it would be about 10 more minutes. 20 more minutes passed and we observed a family who we thought came after us get seated. We inquired with the hostess again and was told that WE had only been waiting for an hour and that family had been waiting for an hour and 15 minutes. The hostess was snobby and dismissive about it. Not to mention she had just told us we would be seated in 10 minutes, 20 minutes prior. We were finally sat by another unpleasant hostess who was pregnant so I figured I'd give her a  pass for her behavior but seriously? If we hadn't already waited over an hour to eat I probably would have just left. If we had been informed that the wait was over an hour in the first place then we could have made the decision to stay that long and wait. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Definitely a case of the restaurant franchise and quality problem.  Our waitress seemed overworked, tired and unfriendly. 
Not only did my silverware come with dried food on it, so did my boyfriend's. I've attached pictures of the dirtiest ones- be sure to check them before using them. Food was bland, overpriced- you are paying for the ambience and interior decoration than for the food, some of the ahi tuna slices were shredded and simply layered underneath other ones to hide it, was not fresh, very corporate-franchise. I doubt they have a real chef in the kitchen.  They could've at least made the plating attractive. Not the worst restaurant experience, but I'll not bother to come back."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the experience I had today at this restaurant. I will break it down by service, food, overall price per person for the experience given.

Décor: If you've never been inside a Cheesecake Factory, it will be a visual overload. Firstly, it will be packed of kids and adults alike, sitting around waiting for tables. They have a big fridge/cheesecake display case to start getting you hooked onto buying a $8-dollar slice of small cheesecake. This is come to play later...

Food: Sadly, this is where things went wrong for me. I order the Cuban Sandwich, that usually comes with \"Pulled Pork\", which sadly looked like an old pork chop that was slapped onto the bread. Sliced deli ham, swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, on a toasted roll. I got something close to this, but also a giant black hair in my food. They apologized, and gave me a salad while the rest of my party ate. I got a new one fast, but it looked like it was rushed. The sandwich could've been made by my daughter, and would've looked nicer. I was shocked, and only ate part of the first half, and left the rest. The cheesecake slices have taken a HUGE dive in size. You pay roughly $8 dollars a piece of a slice of cheesecake. It has become a little overpriced. 
Service: So, our first server Cole, was amazing. He was attentive, funny, and tried to connect with us on a quick, professional level. He sadly had a shift change, and our server Jessica was great. What I don't understand is, if you find hair in your food, you would want to comp the meal. I shouldn't have had to pay to wait for another version of my food because someone doesn't keep sanitary practices in the kitchen. The manager did apologize, but for me, I find it highly disappointing that they still charged me for this. 
Overall: Due to this experience, I don't think I will return to Cheesecake Factory. I think there is some coaching moments that need to happen between the kitchen staff, and management. As a consumer, they should've taken that meal off the check, or at least offer to pay for dessert. A $3.00-dollar salad doesn't compensate a $15-dollar meal. I would love to speak more to someone from the restaurant or corporate, but I doubt it will happen."}
{"text":"Their chocolate tuxedo cheesecake is chocolatey, creamy and moist it is truly the best. Service is fast, friendly enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Just a warning portion is HUGE like our American neighbours :)   I went to the soft opening and they have tons of staffs.  Seems running quite smoothly and the food taste great.  Of course the highlight is the chessecake and just FYI they are not made in Canada but delivered directly from the warehouse in the states where they have the best quality control.  I ordered the calamari, pizza style chicken parmesan and the godiva cheesecake.  The calamari is big, I would say that's probably the size of two appetizers in a normal restaurant.  The chicken parmesan for $20.50 is prob the best deal you can get.  The chicken is shaped like a pizza on the bottle and the angel hair pasta lays on top.  The cheesecake, you know how good it is I dun even need to explain.  Must try for comfort food lover and be prepare to line up as they dont take reservation.  Feel free to shop in yorkdale during your wait, there's always tons of great retailers to see."}
{"text":"My favorite was the Thai chicken wrap appetizer.  Great to share but don't plan on having room for dessert unless there are four of you sharing it. The menu here offers a huge variety. I ventured away from my usual favorite entrées (Meat loaf, asian or one of the pasta dishes) and tried the jambalaya pasta. The flavor was delicious but the chicken was dry,  as was the entire dish. It was probably overcooked. The flavor was so good that I may try it again after getting the waiter's opinion about the norm for this dish.  About the waiter,  he did a great job despite a very busy night. We spent $80 for 2, with alcohol. Norm is more like $20-$25 ea. Recommended"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I visited this CF last night and are iffy about returning. The wait wasn't bad at all, maybe ten minutes tops. After being seated we were provided the complimentary bread & water. We both opted to trying a mixed drink off the menu: Whiskey Smash & the Ultimate Margarita. The Smash wasn't terrible, had decent flavor but did taste a little watered down after a few sips. The Margarita, however, was terrible- tasted purely of margarita mix & nothing else; pretty much had to force it down- no sense in wasting a $10 drink. We also ordered the Corn Tamale Cakes as an appetizer. These were kinda weird; flavor was more sweet than anything. There are 3 cakes to a plate, I barely finished one and we didn't even touch the third.

Our visit thus far was mediocre, but we decided to still order entrees. I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken  Gumbo which was no gumbo at all. I grew up eating gumbo & have always known it to have a broth to make it almost like a soup; this was just gloopy and mush. There was absolutely no flavor, the shrimp was overcooked & extremely chewy and the rice was still hard. I took a few bites and couldn't force anymore down. It was gross. 

My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair. The description talks about all this lemon, garlic flavor with some marinara sauce. This \"meal\" had absolutely no flavoring. It seemed like they made the pasta, threw a hefty helping of bruschetta tomatoes on top and threw on 5 pieces of overcooked shrimp to it & charged us $17.95. There was no sauce, no lemon/herb flavor. My boyfriend took 2 bites and pushed it to the side. It was terrible. 

We immediately asked for our check & our server didn't even ask if everything was alright or if there was anything she could do. Nope, she just dropped our check off and that was that, even after seeing the full plates of food still. An $89 meal that was beyond basic and left us both feeling disappointed, frustrated and hungry."}
{"text":"My family visited ceasars palace and ate here. Our waiting time was only ten minutes despite all the people. Our server was the best. He recommended several great dishes. The food was higher than our expections...."}
{"text":"Roll the dice to see if they actually give you what you order.  This place has the worst customer service.  The food is tasty what with all the salt and fat and all.  However, they ALWAYS seem to get something wrong, leave something out, include a hair, etc.  My rule is if the food is expensive (like it is here) I do not give the restaurant much room for error with my order."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times.

It's a fantastic place if you need a good variety menu. They literally have everything as far as type of food goes. I couldn't imagine them not having something for a very picky person.

This place is busy, and for good reason I'm sure. Customer service is good about 60% of the time. I think it really depends on who you luck out with. Or perhaps I may have just gotten a new trainee a couple of times. Long story short, we've been admittedly forgotten about at our table on 2 different occasions. I thought this was kind of odd. Took about 1 hour and 45 minutes from sitting down to finishing our food. Clearly this is uncommon and a mistake. Mistakes happen, I get it. This is unfortunately why I can't give this place a higher rating just yet. 

Cheesecake is of course wonderful, along with the rest of their menu. I haven't tried any drinks, but they also have a plentiful amount of what to choose from. 

Its in a great location, right by the mall. This could also be why its very busy at around Dinner times. Its close to me, so I'm sure I'll be back in the near future to try and get this to a higher rating! :)

Food quality 4/5
Customer service 3/5
Restaurant cleanliness 5/5
Value 3/5"}
{"text":"I'm not on a quest to go to CF every weekend, but coincidentally it seems like I am. We \"happened\" to be in the neighborhood so when all else fails, cheesecake seems to work.  I have to say this visit was not inspiring. 

The Caesar salad is always a favorite and my mini foodie always insists we order it, so that's an automatic.

We started off with an appetizer.  We got the sweet corn tamales and I was a little disappointed, bland despite all the flavors of avocado, parsley, tomato and sour cream, it just gets a two star.

I ordered the shrimp tacos and the side serving of rice was so lame!  Usually I get enough to share so the serving was disappointing.

My little one ordered a pepperoni pizza and this time it was greasy and slimy. YUK.

Overall, I won't be visiting this Cheesecake, I'll stick to Summerlin or the Ceasar's Palace one instead:( Oh, BTW service was good but waiter a bit robotic."}
{"text":"It was our last goodbye dinner with our wonderful friends who are leaving to San Diego.  It was crazy since we had all the kids with us but since the restaurant is so noisy no one seemed to mind.  

I have a few items that are my go-to favorites and tonight I had the crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus-ohhh delicioso. Pumpkin cheesecake when in season is my favorite!  Cant wait for fall!

The red sangria is a must here too, they add fresh strawberries. We shared a mango and key lime slice of cheesecake and since I just like classic cheesecake, this wasn't a favorite. Kids shared a pepperoni pizza portions are huge!

Service was friendly and prompt.  Free valet which I recommend since the parking lot gets busy and nice convenient Summerlin Location in Boca Park next to Kona Grill. Check it out there's something on the menu for everyone!"}
{"text":"So I thought this would be a perfect place to grab lunch and OMG wish we would have just grabbed some Pupusas... what a disappointment!

Our waiter was like a walking zombie-idiot with no service skills whatsover.  He never even introduced himself-I thought he was the busboy and they were shortstaffed.  Just worthless! 

Our table was a booth and they stuck a chair at the end of it and it was located next to the silverwear, so every waiter/busboy who came by every 15 seconds to rattle silverwear...ugh...noisy and bothersome!  We should have left.

I ordered a boring plain chopped salad that was tasteless.  Kids had grilled cheese and pasta, so thank goodness I was able to take bites out of their decent food.  Sisters got..I don't even remember because I couldn't wait to get out of there and we even skipped dessert because the waiter was so useless!

It will be a while before I go back!"}
{"text":"Wait time is long, everything else is fab.  

I came here with a friend and we met up with a party of 11.  As a large party and almost guaranteed a phat tip we were still treated pretty well.  I got the tuna and my friend got the miso salmon.  For some reason my tuna was cooked so you could see gray/white throughout, the last two times I had it where my tuna was red/rose.  I don't know what the norm is but they made it the way I wanted.  

You have to limit yourself to the food because the best part is the dessert!  It's not called Cheesecake Factory because of the pasta or meat or fish.  There are no items on the menu with name's like Cheesecake ahi tuna or Cajun Cheesecake Jumbalaya but White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle or Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake!  Mmmm!!

So my fav:
Miso Salmon!!  Wasabi Encrusted Ahi Tuna!!!!  Steak Diane!  Cajun Jambalaya Pasta!  And the above Cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"Last visit here I had the Flying Gorilla at the bar while waiting for a table, Flying Gorilla is a chocolate banana liquor shake.  This drink could be too rich for most people but I like it.  At the bar, I ordered the wasabi ahi.  And I'm so glad it was raw red in the center, the last tuna I had was cooked all the way.

Other than that, the cheesecakes are stillll good.  I fancy all their cheesecakes and I seriously do not know how you can choose a favorite but if I had to, I'd go with the peanut butter cup fudge cheesecake.  I don't care about breaking out and getting pimples from eating it but come'onnnn, cheesecake with reeses pb cup and butterfingers!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here was when I was a freshman back at UNLV in '96.  I went to the one in Caesar's Palace.  Wow, was I amazed, probably because coming from Maui we didn't have too many places like this.  It was busy, bustling with lots of people, and lots of good food and drink.  It was one of the better dining experiences I remember.

This review comes from the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park.  I took my gf's daughter there for her 6th birthday (a very important time for a little one).  It was just her and me.  This was her first time here (that she can remember) and she was just as awestruck as I was when I first saw the place.  The decor can be considered a mix of new and old, big, tall front doors, the ambience with lots of mood lighting and tall ceilings.  It almost seems like you're stepping into a 5 star restaurant.  That is until, you see dad in his khaki shorts and mom with her summer sandals.  Which is nice, because it makes the place seem less pompous and more friendly.

I really like the food here.  I love the big portions and the mix of American, Italian, and Asian food they serve.  After seating us, we received our complimentary bread basket which I usually look forward to.  They give the usual 2 types of bread, a crusty french bread, and a wonderful wheat pumpernickel type bread.  It's really good but only when it's hot and fresh, so make sure if your server gives you a cold basket you request a new fresh one.

I don't usually have any appetizers here because I like to save room for the large entree (which I never finish) and possibly some cheesecake (well...duh, it's Cheesecake Factory), but I have heard folks say that their Thai Lettuce Wraps are definitely worth trying.  Their Factory Nachos with chicken is a pretty big platter as well and is great for sharing.

I for some reason always order the same thing when I go to a place I like.  This time was no different.  I got my fav, the DOUBLE B.B.Q. BACON CHEESEBURGER.  I LOVE this thing.  It's a double-decker Angus burger with a BBQ-ranch sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon, crispy fried onions, lettuce and tomato.  You also get a side on fries.  This bad boy well over a  pound once you put it together.  I can never get the thing in my mouth so I gotta eat it in layers.  I always end up eating only half, and take the other half home for a nice midnight snack.  This burger is SOOOO good, you gotta try it.

The little one got FETTUCINI WITH CHICKEN AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES.  Smart kid, this dish cost me around $16  (almost TWICE the price of my burger)...and here I thought she wanted to order off the kids menu.  Quick note **this place has NO kids menu** so if you bring them in they order off the big people menu too.  I thought she wanted chicken fingers...she was like, \"No, I want white sauce\".  Lucky birthday girl...white sauce it is!  The fettuccini comes in a nice size bowl, and was flavored excellently.  It has this garlic cream-parmesan sauce that was very creamy and rich and complimented the grilled chicken well.  It also has sun-dried tomatoes on it, which I like, but the little one thought they were gross so I had to put them on the side.  For a kid that weighs only 45 pounds, she nearly killed that pasta.  She ate a good 3/4 of it by herself.  You can tell she liked it because she had a ring of white cream sauce around her lips.  So funny!

You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and NOT try their cheesecake!  That's like going to gym and not working out (although I may have done that once..or twice).  They have like over 50 cheesecakes you can choose from, and they range from about $6 -$8 a slice.  A bit pricey, but worth it for some stellar cheesecake.  You're not supposed to have more than one slice at a time anyway.  We didn't get any cheesecake this trip (the little one said 'Eww' to cheesecake and settled on her complimentary birthday sundae), which makes my first sentence in this paragraph a little contradictory.  Oh well.  But I can tell you my favorites are Tres Leches cheesecake (so dreamy), and the Oreo cheesecake (full of Oreo chunks).  Great for an end to your dining.  You can also request to take a slice of cheesecake to go and your server will pack it up for you in a nice little cheesecake container to take with you.  

All in all it was a nice time.  The little one enjoyed her pasta, her pint-sized birthday sundae, and the Happy Birthday singing from some of the servers.  I always enjoy going here, great food and great service.

SO GO.  HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT, GET SOME WINE, AND END WITH SOME CHEESECAKE.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We were staying in Las Vegas strip but went out to Red Rock Canyon for the day and used YELP to find this location away from the busy strip before heading back to our hotel. 
We were at this restaurant on 11-23-2015 at about 5:30pm. 
We had decent service with one issue that was poorly addressed by our server. My little one ordered grilled chicken from the kids menu . It came with grilled chicken mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  I reached over to try one of his carrots and it tasted funny to me. I thought it was my imagination but I noticed he left them all on his plate at the end of our meal. He said they  were not good. 
I reached over and tasted one again and indeed they were rancid. I smelled the pile on his plate and yes they were rancid indeed. 
I am not one to complain about things and my main concern was that the restaurant would serve them to other patrons. My wife let the waitress know in a non defensive manner about the carrots and she rudely  offered to replace them with another vegetable but we were not asking for carrot replacement, we were all done with our meals. 
She was very nonchalant about issue and mumbled she would take them to the chef????? Then came back and dropped off our bill and never apologized or let her superiors know or chef or whoever she reports to. Never said a word and that was it. Picked up credit card and dropped it off hastily after she charged it. 
We noticed they outline tip suggestion, our bill was 92 dollars and suggested tip was 16 dollars. My wife and I decided to leave without tipping. We have never in 15 years being married not left a tip. I worked for auto customer service for a long time and I appreciate tips and good service. 
The decent thing to do would be to apologize and say that she has let the chef or her manager know and kindly apologized and removed charge. 
The non tipping was far more than 6.50, kids meal price, the restaurant would have been out of. 
Poor customer service."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory is as one would expect if you've been to one of their other  locations.

Huge menu and portions, friendly service, food typically delivered to the table quickly and as ordered, and a lot of dessert choices...of course!

The addition a while back of the Skinnylicious menu is appreciated; we often choose one appetizer and one main course and split the two as our lunch.  Then a slice of cheesecake to go for breakfast the next morning.

Drink prices (especially the bellini or other speciality options) are ridiculously expensive so we tend to shy away from the adult beverages.

We prefer this location over Cesar's Mall because fewer tourists, less wait for a table, and certainly time saved because there's no maze to find it in the first place."}
{"text":"The worst service out of all the Cheesecake restaurants I've visited. Ran out of bread and our food took a very long time to arrive. Wouldn't recommend. Front desk was also unfriendly."}
{"text":"Celebrated our birthdays here and were given exceptional service. Walker, the manager went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Well we finally made it to the cheesecake.  It looks nice.  However the staff were really not polite at all including the manager Adam.  Worst of all THEY GOT A CONDITIONAL PASS FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.  I really do not recommend going here.   Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I don't think that I have ever had a bad meal at a Cheesecake factory and this was no different.  Thai chicken pasta and fish & chips were great, as well as the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Had the typical great Cheesecake Factory meal here.  One of the few chain restaurants that the meal is always consistently good."}
{"text":"Came here on V-Day. Which obviously is going to be very busy. I'm not rating on how long I waited to be seated or the food which was cooked wrong btw but I understand the cooks had a lot on their hands so I'll let it pass by. I am rating our waiter that night. It was an ok service. However, even though it was busy, the waiter wasn't attending to the whole restaurant which I had no clue why he wasn't around much in our area when we needed to be attended to. The other 4 couples that were there also didn't experience much of him. Took him 20 minutes to get me a soda and when he came back I asked him about it and he had forgotten about it. He did apologize but man, what if I choked on my food though? We did leave him a very good tip but tbh it wasn't worth the service."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.   The nutty chocolate marshmallow shake is to die for."}
{"text":"Is it possible to have a heart-healthy yet delicious meal at Cheesecake Factory? Why yes of course.

A meal for two:
- Guacamole for $12, swap chips for celery at no extra cost. You can see chunks of avocado.

- Miso salmon, which Michael Ruhlman so enthusiastically endorsed. Lunch portion for $14.

Request to reduce sodium and fat.

Both dishes still come out delicious.

Take a Godiva chocolate, Reese peanut butter chocolate, or original with strawberry cheesecake to go? At your own discretion."}
{"text":"Just had their mushroom burger last night (11/07/14) and it was outstanding.
At 12.50 its not cheap but its large, super tastey and worth every cent.

As for the factory in general...... The place can be a literal zoo on fri and sat nights at 6 pm . A mass of humanity . Plan accordingly or prepare for the dinner apocalypse!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times and their food is good.
Above average prices though.......
And yes folks.....THIS PLACE GETS BUSY. Especially during SNOWBIRD season.
in fact...the place can be a very loud zoo at times.

Try their burgers and their avocado, mushroom, zuchini fries....fresh made!

Update: seriously! This place makes some gourmet style burgers!  Try the mushroom burger with swiss and fontana cheese and sauteed mushrooms. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great food.. Slow service, I mean really slow bordering on bad service. We went at lunch when the restaurant was not crowded .. I had the lunch Asian chicken lettuce tacos. They were fantastic. The twins ordered kid meals. The first was the chicken tender kids meal. One of the best kids meals I have seen. Highly recommended for kids. The second  kids meal was the burger sliders they were just ok. The kids fries are served in a silver bucket which the kids love. We had for dessert the Oreo cheesecake.. Safe choice for anyone. It was more than enough for one adult and 2 school aged kids."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night and everthing was amazing. Our server Christopher was outstanding, so helpful and friendly. My dish came out warm and I mentioned it to the server and he offered to have it heated for me, but it was fine I didnt want them to go through the trouble since it still tasted delicious.  The manager heard about my food being warm and came over to apologize and took the dish off our check. That was very kind of him, since I really didnt mind that much. I would definitely come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Visit was on 1/11/12-
I expect more from the Cheesecake Factory, especially for the price.  This use to be one of my fave places to eat but no more.  It was 10 minutes before we got water, another 10 before our order for apps was taken.  We ordered the crispy taquitos to start with.  Tasty but the guacamole was so skimpy-not enough for 2 people to have a decent dab.  The hubby ordered the Ribbed Eye (at CF? Really???). It was overcooked but service was so spotty that night that we were afraid to send it back.  it came with fries...The fries are different and not for the better.  I ordered the stuffed chicken tortilla.  It was still as good as I remembered.  CF still has the best Ranch dressing.  We ordered cheesecake to go.  My husband got the Coconut cream which he said was \"fine\".  I tried the Pineapple upside down cake.  It was just okay but that isn't a quality issue-just a matter of taste.

Like most of the chains restaurants, it is easy to see that they have skimped here & there to make their profit.  I would rather they be honest-either keep the quality with smaller proportions or charge more.   Can't give them an A-ok because for the price it was a huge disappointment and it seems the last few times we have gone, our experience gets just a little bit worse..."}
{"text":"On 11/20/15 I had the most amazing service from a very happy waitress. It was my boyfriends and I 1 year anniversary. She was soo positive and attentive. I never had such great service especially for a chain restaurant which is usually why we stay away from them, Thankyou for a great night!"}
{"text":"I love this place everything on the menu is good I've never had a bad experience I go here often however if you have never been look the menu up online first it can be very overwhelming because it is vast also this place gets crazy busy so try to go during the week or when your not as hungry because even with reservations the wait can be long during busy times I just wish there were more locations here in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Confusion is not inherently bad, for when one thing is mistaken for another, it only means that the two entities share similar qualities. The Cheesecake Factory is a place of much confusion, but the confusion only testifies to its goodness. 

The atmosphere and architecture can be confused for an Indian palace.

The kind wait staff are indistinguishable from Chick-fil-A employees.

The menu can easily be mistaken for a phonebook. 

The bathrooms parallel dimly lit, royal throne rooms of old. 

The bill has an uncanny resemblance to the U.S. national debt. 

The cheesecake, however, is distinctly unique. It cannot be confused with anything else, for it is the object that other great and wonderful things are confused with. It is, indeed, the magnum opus of the dessert world."}
{"text":"$$$$. The food is exquisite and if it isn't, they will gladly work with you to make it what you want. It goes without saying the cheesecake is out of this world- worth every cent and such a lovely environment. I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Think of a restaurant that has a little bit of everything to please every member of your party, and ending the night with a delicious slice of cheesecake. They also have amazing free bread they give out as well. This location is located in the north outlet mall. If you can find where the street \"symphony\" is at the mall, that is where the restaurant is located. Parking garage is located right across the street and parking is FREE! Woohoo. Great place for a date night or any kind of meal. They have a huge menu offering a lot of different stuff, and a huge cheesecake menu!"}
{"text":"Love the hours of Cheesecake Factory! Good food open until 11! Not many places open that late. Never had a problem with anything I ordered. The tex mex egg rolls are the bomb. It should always be ordered! Cheesecake is to die for. I just tried the Adam's something cheesecake (forgot the name) it had peanut butter, caramel, chocolate in it. So yummy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dish is the Chicken Madiera. It has melted cheese and mushroom on top of chicken filet and mashed potatoes that was good with the Madiera sauce. Their portion can feed 2 people so my husband and I shared it. 
I wasn't a fan of the service though. I knew they were busy, but that's normal for Cheesecake Factory. Our server asked us if we wanted a fruit plate for my toddler and we said yes, but they never brought it to us.  All of our dishes came out, except my toddlers meal came last. Which you would think would come with the rest or be the first one out. Especially, it being just noodles and Alfredo sauce. Time for dessert and our server was nowhere to be found. When I finally found him, I just skipped the dessert and asked for the check."}
{"text":"If I could give this Cheesecake Factory zero stars I would!  First the server loses our order, she said she can't read her own handwriting and has to retake our order.  The 2 appetizers we ordered took 45 minutes to come out.  I ordered an Apple martini, the server said they couldn't make one even though the bar looked to have every type of alcohol there is. So I ordered a margarita, it took so long to come out I  never ordered another one. The women's bathroom had a long line, so they had no TP in some of the stalls, no paper towels and the trash cans were overflowing with paper towels all over the floor.  We finally got our food, it was lukewarm, we didn't complain because we wanted to get out of there.  The server brings us our check and we noticed we were charged twice for one of our appetizers so she had to adjust our bill.  I'm.from Las Vegas, I'm in Pittsburgh visiting my fiance's family.  This CF reminds me of the tourist one at the Premium Outlet Mall that remains so busy the employees no longer give a damn about service."}
{"text":"When the Cheesecake Factory opened at the Premium Outlet mall downtown, I was super excited because it is close to both my job and my home.  My boyfriend and I have been  there for the grand opening, and we have been there many times since mostly for the convenience.   EVERY time we've been there it has been a disappointment!  The food was low quality and I especially remember how disgusting the restrooms were!  We were convinced it was a CF in name only, the employees didn't care  and the owners were not going to make ANY effort to provide the great food and customer service of others because it's in a 'tourist spot.' Tonight we were pleasantly surprised!  I ordered the Tuscany chicken, it was hot and flavorful.  My boyfriend's chicken Madero was just how he ordered and he ate all of it.  When I went to the restroom, there was someone cleaning it and filling the TP!  Our server had a large party in our section due to a bday, but she handled it like a pro and was super attentive.  FINALLY, we feel it's the REAL CF and will come back! The only complaint I have is we ordered a piece of the 6 layer chocolate cake to go, it was cut sloppily and not very big, other than that was good."}
{"text":"I only come here for their cheesecake, calamari, and bread. These are the only yummy things they have. The 4 star rating is for the above alone, and for the great service I always get.

The actual food...please, if you want good food, don't come here. They have a big selection of overpriced food items you and your family and friends can choose from. I went last night with a $50 gift card and got shrimp scampi, buffalo blast, and a moscow mule.

Shrimp Scampi-$20- breaded shrimp that was all soggy when it came out. The shrimp itself was pretty big but all dried up and had no juicyness or bouncyness in them. I usually love shrimp, but I had two of these and couldn't handle anymore. The angel hair pasta was alright...

Buffalo Blast-$10- big portion for an appetizer! But way overcooked, and most of it is just breading anyways. 

Moscow Mule-$10-for a moscow mule?! It better be good. Well, it wasn't. It was so sweet and I did not taste a bit of alcohol. 

I've been here many times when I was young to celebrate many achievements in life, and I've had the food here many times. When I grew up and started paying for my own food, I ended up coming here for their 3 things I mentioned above. I had wondered why I never ordered their entrees here, and yesterday's dinner reminded me why."}
{"text":"Predictably good with one of the most extensive, yet consistently delicious menu options. No matter what you are craving, chances are, you will find it on the menu. The Chinese Chicken Salad is HUGE and can easily feed two or three people. Oh, and the cheesecake isn't half bad either. We always take a slice home to enjoy."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would have give it .
 Disgusting food disgusting service .

Don't go in to this place ."}
{"text":"I love everything about cheese cake factory except their prices.

I love their cheesecake.

And although the quality of food shouldn't make it so, their prices are a bit
Much. If I do come here I usually have a couple items from their small plates section and a slice of cheesecake to go.

I love their Tex Mex egg rolls and their clam chowder! 

They serve the clam chowder on Fridays and it's really good! I always get a bowl and eat it with the bread basket. 

I've tried a few of their entrees and when I saw what I was paying for, it definitely made my meal a bit less enjoyable.

Their wait staff is usually very nice and professional but nothing extraordinary. 

And PS their red velvet cake cheesecake is NOT as good as everyone claims. Way over rated.

Try Kaluah cream, Dutch caramel apple streussel, lemon raspberry, white chocolate raspberry truffle, or tiramisu! They all have something more than just the cream over a crust."}
{"text":"Great place to rest your feet from shopping and awesome food. Classic burger hit the spot."}
{"text":"Easy place to eat. Large menu. Got the avocado egg rolls, and the bistro shrimp pasta. Both are good except they should have put more sauce on the pasta. Serving size is HUGE, shared my plate with my mum and we were both stuffed. Service is a little slow... Didn't refill bread and water took a while to refill. The servers were very polite though."}
{"text":"Cheesecake is sub par and the rest of my dining experience was utter crap. I experienced an awful wait time, and the food provided by this American Chain does not hold up to the bar. I expect much more from this company let alone a common place to eat in the U.S. Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory Reminds me of back home. I always sit at the bar. Great service, great food. Dope place to come for lunch."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  The service is horrible, the food is mediocre and now three of us have food poisoning!!  Do NOT eat here!  We ordered curbside, waited an hour for our food.  I paid with \"cake pay\". The server argued with me stating I hadn't paid, had to wait another 15 minutes for her to figure it out.  Now my 7 year old and 13 year old have vomited multiple times all over their beds, carpet and respective bathrooms and I have had diarrhea for an hour!  Either the incompetent staff intentionally did something to make us sick (because I complained about the excessive wait) or it's a terrible coincidence because we all ordered different items.  We are big fans of the Cheesecake Factory but this particular location has failed multiple times with us, this final time being the worst and the last!"}
{"text":"I came to this location and used curb side service. It was easy to order over the phone (even though the hold was longer than 5 mins). I arrived at the mall and didn't know where curb side parking was but found it after asking the staff while calling them to let them know I was there. It didn't take long for my food to come out. My food was hot and exactly what I ordered. I would suggest curbside if you're in a hurry or don't want to deal with the inside experience."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for a date night.  It was around 5 and not busy.  They took our name and said they would be right with us.  As we sat there for 10 minutes, we saw 8 different groups come in and be seated immediately.  Some the same as us, groups of two.  A group of four and a group of three too.  All got seated before us as we stood there, 10 feet away.  We could see empty tables from where we're standing.  The hostess looked at us several times and simply ignored us.  I love the Cheesecake Factory and I was looking forward to it, but never again at this location.  We went across the street to the Hofbräuhaus House and enjoyed their wonderful food for the first time (they sat us immediately).  Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Service and location is nice.  The 2 stars is because i ordered a simple dish with plain pasta with chicken and light tomato sauce.  What I got was just that, but, WITH spices in it that started burning the inside of my mouth....  It was impossible to enjoy the meal.  I kept drinking my lemonade hoping the hot spice taste would go away.  It only just got worse.  I sent back the dish and skipped the meal.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years and still the food is delicious.  I would recommend it to anyone. Always busy though especially Friday nights. I recommend the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp but it's ALL good."}
{"text":"Whoever thought of putting a sit down restaurant in a shopping outlet is a genius! Sometimes we just need a break from all the fast food even when we're on the go (but don't get me wrong I love me some Panda Express still). 

This location is just like every other ones I've been to, which isn't a bad thing! It wouldn't be Cheesecake Factory if it wasn't big in size, portion, and in choices. Even the lunch portion size fills you right up! The taste is always on point and consistent so you never have to worry. 

Their service is always great! From the moment we walked in, we were constantly handled with so much care. The only thing is that our food took 20 minutes to come out. But our server Jessica made sure to check up on us and apologized for the wait!

If you're going to be shopping off the calories, doesn't that mean this place is worth the visit?"}
{"text":"I always enjoy Cheesecake factory! I had the Jamaican shrimp and chicken with rice which was very tasty. Then forced down the Snicker's cheesecake! I love that one :)"}
{"text":"A great dinning experience as usual. We ordered the Chinese chicken salad, fresh crisp and not overdressed. Shrimp scampi without the arugula, recommended by the server, delicious. A couple of cold Stella Artois, refreshing! And topped it 
Off with a creamy NY style cheesecake... A must visit restaurant at Boca Park."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the chain in California, which is where I'm from. For whatever reason this one was far better. Left feeling full and satisfied with my meal. Food tasted great, my Steak Diane was medium rare and not overcooked (as per my usual experience at the one back home).

Good experience overall. Server was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch had the Chicken Madeira. Finished up with a piece of cheesecake with fresh strawberries. MMMM Good food and service."}
{"text":"Hubby and I got a CF gift card for Christmas and made a date night out of it. This is, I believe, one of the two cf in Las Vegas. This one was located inside of the Forum Shops at Caesers. Outside of the restaurant was very crowded due to customers going in and out and the little fire show that goes on right outside of the restaurant. I'm glad we asked for seats deeper inside because we ended up getting a 2 person booth which was way more quite and had more of a private feel to it. 

The service we received here was excellent. Everything we asked for got there in no time by one of the waiters even if we had asked another one of them. We were impressed. The food was good too. I have some chicken pesto pasta dish and my husband got the fish tacos. We both liked our food and the Adios Long Island drinks were strong and awesome. 

We really had a good time at this place but were just too full by the end to try any of their cheesecake desserts - which means we will have to go back for another visit."}
{"text":"My ABSOLUTE worst experience being here. I've came many times here and never waited THIS long for my main course to come out. I have been very patient with them and waited but by the time the pasta came out, I just honestly didn't have an appetite anymore because i waited so long for my food. The manager came by and apologized and offered us dessert but didn't fix our check even for curtesy of not enjoying or eating my main course. Disappointed at the management and how they want to resolve the situation. Now we know not to come back at that location. Very upset with my visit tonight."}
{"text":"Who says that Cheesecake Factory has to be busy with long waits?
Who says you can't find something somewhat healthy at a Cheesecake Factory?

Nutrition wise, I've been trying to clean it up for the last 10+ weeks. Sometimes eating meals prepped at home can be a bit of a grind.  So, it's good to eat out every once in awhile to break up the monotony. I recently met up with the gf and a friend for lunch here. I discovered their Skinnylicious menu a couple of months ago, so I knew I'd find something clean. Just a reminder, this is a Cheesecake Factory and that means big portions.  Their Skinnylicious menu is no different.  You can get a range from salmon, turkey, lean steak, and chicken off their healthier side of the menu. But don't expect super low calories due to the portion size.  My advice, split your meal.  But for me, I'm going to be all I can be and eat all I can eat...in moderation that is.  If you do that, then expect a calorie range between 490-590.  Still...this isn't too bad.

Like the rest of the Cheesecake Factories out there, there's always something for everyone.  Since I've only had something off their Skinnylicious menu at this location, I am not able to comment on the rest of their food.  I have been to other Cheesecake Factories and pretty much tried everything. I have never been disappointed.  Service was great here and ironically, we didn't have to wait too long to be seated and served.  I'll most definitely be back.  



YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (417/500)"}
{"text":"July 30th is National Cheesecake Day. What better way to celebrate this surely made-up holiday then by meeting some friends at The Cheesecake Factory? That is exactly what I did this past Friday.

My group was made up of a coworker, his wife, their 2 year old son, and another coworker. Two of us arrived first, we decided to start out in the bar area because it was happy hour. $5 drinks! 

Despite the crowd, we were seated within about 10 minutes from arrival. Our server, Paul, greeted us with an \"Aloha!\" and brought out waters and some bread for us to munch on while we waited for the rest of our group. 

Once the rest of our group arrived, Paul came back over to see if we had any questions. A member of our group asked him for his personal suggestions and he rattled off his favorites for all parts of the menu, from salads to pasta to fish dishes.  Anyone that has been to The Cheesecake Factory knows that the menu is like a short novel, I was impressed with how knowledgeable Paul was about everything on the menu. 

Since some of us were hungry and others were more interested in drinks and desert (namely, me!), we ended up splitting a few appetizers between the group, and then two people ordered entrees as well. First appetizer choice was avocado egg rolls. This is my must-order item at Cheesecake Factory, nothing compares to their avocado egg rolls. We also had the crab cakes and the sweet corn tamale cakes. They were all excellent. 

Finally it was desert time. Since it was National Cheesecake Day, all slices were half price. Bonus! I ordered my usual, a slice of the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. It is unbelievable, the tartness of the lemon and raspberry are the perfect compliment to the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake.

Paul ended up being the icing on the cake, the reason a 4 star review became a 5 star one. He was an exceptional server, he always seemed to know when to come check on us, and when to leave us alone. A member of our group was so pleased with the service he waited after paying the bill to speak to the manager and let him know just how happy he was to have had Paul serve us. 

Will I be back? Yes, and I won't be waiting til National Cheesecake Day to go!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Cheesecake Factory in forever; honestly, I stay away from most chain restaurants these days. However, it's what the family wanted and I was up for it, too, since it had been so long since my last visit. We placed a big order to go and ate at home. The bread was delicious, as always. The food on the other hand, was average. I wouldn't rush to go eat there but they always provide a decent meal. The menu is literally a book, so it will please ANYBODY. We finished off the meal with several pieces of cheesecake which was a pretty good end to the evening. I won't turn down another meal here, but it' just wouldn't be my first choice, either."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst cheesecake experiences I've ever had. We went out to celebrate an early Mother's Day dinner and ended up being a total waste of time. Horrible customer service for one! The host was rude and had this angry look on her face, expressing how much she hates the world and the people in front of her. We were seated quickly. Guess that was the highlight of the night. The server comes up and greeted us, ask if we would like some starters or a beverage. Took the order and came back 15 mins later, placed 2 of the 4 drinks on the table. Never gave us any straws... another strike in the books... came back 5 minutes after that to give us the other two drinks. We ordered food, ended up waiting 45+ mins for a fettuccine alfredo, 4 cheese pasta, a chicken quesadilla and a cheese burger. Keeping in mind that the restaurant wasn't even really that busy.. (Lame...) my mother in law then noticed a piece of stretch wrap melted in her pasta!!!!! The chicken in the pasta had no seasoning on it at all. My 4 cheese pasta looked as if it was sitting on the hot table baking for hours. We then called our server and brought it to her attention. She said sorry and sent the manager to our table. The manager apologized and said sorry, we wrap our chicken in plastic when breading the chicken to freeze it and that sometimes this issue happens. (Who says that?!!!) what kind of manager would explain to you that it just happens and sorry. He then asked if we wanna try anything else on the menu. We said no thank you and may we have the check please?. The server came back and said, I have something that will make you guys happy again!!! She then said I have dessert menus!!!! We said no thank you check please. She came back and said my manager took that one plate off your bill. The bill should have been discounted in total!!! None of us even finished our food after mom found that plastic!!! This location is really slackin.. I'm still replaying what the manager said to us in my head. (Yeah, sometimes it happens.) I work in the food industry and tonight was unacceptable!!!!! The GM needs to step it up. I used to LOVE Cheesecake Factory!! Now I feel that this night ruined it for me. The other location at the outlet mall was a bust as well. I will not be returning, nor will I be recommending anyone to go here!!!"}
{"text":"Located in Boca Park, we had a late dinner here on a Friday night.  Main reason for us coming here...I was hungry and wanted something that I was low on calories, higher on protein, and close to where we were currently at.  Plus, the food at Cheesecake Factory is as consistent as it gets. Yes, I said lower on calories and The Cheesecake Factory has a special menu for this.  Drumroll...their SkinnyLicious menu. In the last 4 months, I've been to a Cheesecake Factory about 5 times.  Every single time, my meal of choice comes from their healthier options.  This menu has a range from chicken breast, steak, tacos, some fish, and turkey.  Of course, there's a bunch of salad options, but I don't do salads. I tried their White Chicken Chili with Brown Rice.  I was surprised that my meal was less than 500 calories.  It was damn good.  It's basically a lighter chili sauce, some brown rice mixed in, and a whole lot of chicken breast pieces.  Loved it!

As for the service, it didn't start off too well.  It was a Friday night and we got seated right away.  But it took forever for our server to come and take our order. I had to give the eye to one of the employees walking by just to get service.  Within 5 minutes, service is what we got.  By the way, service was great from then on. 

Overall, I'm still giving Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because of their SkinnyLicious Menu and familiar dishes. 

PS:  Hard to say no to the bread basket.  Their brown bread is phenomenal.

{"text":"Went to dinner with my partner and best friend for dinner. I got the BBQ pizza, my partner the chicken parm sandwich and my friend the chicken carbonara. My friends pasta was a tad under cooked and sent it back to return the same way. My pizza was yummy but barely any toppings or sauce. My partner had no complaints but wouldn't tell you even if she had one. Always a pleasure but maybe do something about the topping/sauce/crust ratio??"}
{"text":"I'm mad relieved that I decided to give this location another shot.  I came here for a late lunch the other day with my mom, and the food was seriously legit.  We got two dishes and split them because that's how we do!  We ordered the Herb-crusted Salmon (with asparagus and seasoned green beans) and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  

Both were delicious.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, and the accompanying sauce was ri-DIC-ulous. The green beans were slightly salty but the asparagus was on point!  The pasta was effin' yummy.  The coating on the chicken was thin and crispy, and the pasta was al dente (hell yes!).  

As always, portions were HUGE - def. enough for a second lunch, ha!  Oh, and the bread here was really good!  It came out totally fresh - warm bread FTW.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive.  I'll DEFINITELY be back again.

FYI:  it gets crazy busy here so there's usually a wait.  Just a heads up in case any of ya'll are in a rush!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I work in this mall and have taken my lunch break numerous times here and never had a problem. But today, we took our hour lunch break here during a very slow time of the day and sat in Larry's section. Not only was the server rude and couldn't muster a smile the entire time, but our food took an hour to come out. We tried explaining we were on break and only had an hour, only to get eye rolls in response. The end result was all of our food having to be boxed and taken home to eat after work and we ate bread for lunch. Not a pleasant experience, literally all our server had to do was apologize for the food taking longer and smile. Instead we left with empty stomachs and a bad mood."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory was good as always. Seated right away. Food did not take very long and waitress was pleasant and efficient. Had our favorite stuffed chicken tortillas. It is connected to an outlet mall. There is a parking garage located conveniently by the restaurant; however the garage showed 154 open parking spaces and there was hardly none."}
{"text":"Love the Cajun jambalaya pasta. They give you ample amounts of food. The cheesecake with fresh strawberries is bomb as well."}
{"text":"First time we have been here, the atmosphere was good, the food was very tasty and I ordered cajun jambalaya. Unfortunately I forgot to order cheesecake so next time i will write about cake ;))"}
{"text":"Love love love cheesecake factory!
Spicy chicken chipotle pasta is my all time favorite!
Pair it up with the Red velvet cheesecake &its a wrap!
Always very fast&friendly service. Well earned 5stars"}
{"text":"The service is great very friendly staff, the fried shrimp really good, ribeye also and the filet mignon awesome but the fish tacos bad Baka fresh or rubios have better tacos by far, no flavor, no salsa, the tortillas broke, deserts good"}
{"text":"I don't come to The Cheesecake Factory often but when I do, I always enjoy myself. The food is pretty consistent from one of their restaurants to another and this location was no exception. Came here on a dinner date sometime between 4-5 pm. Parking was hard to find, so had to park toward the very back. 

When we stepped into the restaurant we thought we'd be waiting around for a long time since there were lots of people waiting to be seated, but we were surprised to be seated immediately. We were seated close to the kitchen where it was super loud. Kept hearing things being dropped on the floor. 

Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order, brought it back quickly along with some fresh warm bread with butter. I love the dark bread that they bring out. Not sure what kind it is, but it was soft and has a bit of a sweet taste to it. Their sourdough bread was hard and dry, barely edible! After about 10 minutes she came back to take our food order. 

I ordered the Crispy Beer Battered Fish tacos that came with 3 street tacos, rice, and black beans. The tacos were delicious, but not much to them. Each taco had a small piece of fish, avocado, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and a chipotle sauce. Rice was good, well cooked and seasoned. I think it was a cilantro rice, but can't certain about that. Black beans were tasty as well. Cost $15.50. My guest got the Fettuccini Alfredo. The noodles were well cooked, not overcooked or undercooked. The sauce was tasty, however, it wasn't anything special. It tasted like something you could've gotten at the store. They did give plenty of sauce on the noodles. This cost $16.95. We planned on getting some cheesecake to go, but when we left, the line for ordering cheesecake was super long. 

Pros:
1. Our waitress was nice.
2. Food was good.
3. Nice location and easy to find.
4. Large menu to choose from.

Cons:
1. Too busy at this location.
2. The waitress came by only once during the time we were there. She seemed overwhelmed with the number of tables she had to attend to. 
3. Prices keep going up on their food. The main reason why I don't come often. For two people, without getting drinks or dessert costs over $30 plus tip and we didn't even get the \"expensive\" items on the menu. 
4. Very loud. It was so loud at dinner time that I could hardly hear myself think, let alone hear what my date had to say. There were noises from the kitchen, the staff singing Happy Birthday 3 times, kids and babies crying and screaming, and then just the normal noise of people talking. 

Prices and how loud this place was, making my dining experience not as nice is what makes my review a 3 star instead of a 4 star."}
{"text":"Came to this location around 6 pm on a Wednesday night. Not sure if it was the time of day that I went, but the place was totally crowded and there were people standing from the check-in spot all the way out the front door. I wasn't going to stay, but the lady at check-in told me for a party of two, it would be about 10 minutes. 

After standing and waiting for 25 minutes, we were finally seated. The table that we were seated at, wasn't completely cleaned yet. Please don't seat me if the table isn't ready! Once seated, our waitress took our drink order, which we only asked for ice water. That took 10 minutes to get to us. After about another 10 minutes she took our food order. Normally at Cheesecake Factory, they bring you bread and butter right away, she didn't bring ours until our food was almost brought out. I would've understood if she was actually busy, but we saw her just standing around multiple times.

Our food came out after about 25 minutes, which was delicious as always. It was nice a warm and tasted fresh. Our waitress didn't come around again until we asked for a to-go box and our check. Not sure if she had a long day or was just having a bad one, but she wasn't friendly at all. 

Pros:
1. Nicely located in a shopping area.
2. Food was delicious!

Cons:
1. Unfriendly staff 
2. Crowded
3. Ladies bathroom was dirty and there was paper towels scattered all over the floor.

Food we ordered:
1.My friend ordered the  Mac N Cheese Burger with a Caesar salad. Loved the salad. Dressing was amazing. I don't know what was different about it, but it was the best I've tasted. Burger was also delicious. Meat Charbroiled and topped with our creamy fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls and Cheddar Cheese Sauce.
2. I ordered the Garlic Noodles that had oven roasted tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms, fresh asparagus and Parmesan in a garlic sauce. Was soo good!!
3. Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. I'm a big fan of mango, so I had to order this. It was more then too sweet for me. I was only able to have about 3 bites. Still was good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and sat at the bar. The bartender gave excellent service. I'm a huge fan of peach vodka and unfortunately they don't carry peach Ciroc so he made me a Georgia peach drink with grey goose! It was AMAZING!! I got the lettuce wrap tacos Asian style. So delicious. I would deff recommend this place for a quick lunch. Sit at the bar you'll get great service."}
{"text":"We gave our name and told 10 minute wait. OK the parking at this outlet mall is dreadful. No handicap access and quite a confusing walk to get to this establishment. But we decided to go ahead and eat. The 10 minutes came and went and no one was left to be seated and our name was not called. The callers were too soft spoken considering the loud volume of the overhead music. We were immediately seated when we pointed out to them that our name had not been called, they shuffled for a table. The waitress asked if we wanted water and left one napkin, there were two of us when I requested two waters and had to repeat it when she was leaving the table. We left. The chitter chatterring flirting going on in the front kept those young ladies from doing their jobs it appeared. As we left they said have a nice day. Did they not notice we were just seated and were now leaving. Good thing most of their business comes from tourists, we will not go back as Las Vegas locals. Really No stars!"}
{"text":"Claudia V was my server and she gave an excellent drink recommendation when I asked. She was so sweet and noticed my birthday was the day before. She surprised us with a birthday treat and sung happy birthday! She even spelled my name correctly on the receipt wishing me a happy birthday! She definitely made me love Cheesecake Factory even more, she was excellent!!!! This was our third visit and we always leave impressed!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day brunch with family of ten, obviously is not my choice ( someone in my family responsible for this).

The food was blend and I noticed each of our food on the plates either yellow or white except the arugula and beet salad was the most colorful on the plates.

The white chocolate cheese cake was OK, very high calories.

Our waiter is so nice and helpful, so I'll give him 2 stars, but sorry dude the food wasn't my favorite at all."}
{"text":"First of all, they do not take reservations.  That is a big negative in my book and I almost didn't go as the last time the wait was very long.  They also do not take call-in-advance.  So upon arrival, we were told an hour and a half for a table for two.  The menu is huge and they have lots of options.  The food was okay but nothing special - definitely overpriced for quality.  It was no better and no worse than any other chain joint but significantly higher priced than something like a Sagebrush or Applebys and not better quality.  Five-star prices, three-star quality, one-star service is the best way to describe it.  My date ordered the shrimp and mushroom dish which was served with no mushrooms.  I order the ribeye which was slightly overcooked (ordered medium rare - served medium).  The worst part was definitely service.  Our waiter disappeared for extended periods of time and in fact, never checked on the food which was delivered to the table by someone from the kitchen (I assume), so we never had the chance to explain that the dishes were not exactly correct (I was okay with the steak, but my date specifically wanted the mushrooms in the \"shimp and MUSHROOMS\" dish.  We waited over 30 minutes for the check and another 15 for the cheesecake to-go (which I order before the check).  I will say that the cheesecake was delicious later that night.  I would go back for the cheesecake - probably to-go, but I would definitely not wait for a table when the food is only average at best.  The atmosphere was crowded and chaotic so definitely not a great experience.  I only give two stars because the cheesecake was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a difficult one. I have had super good experiences in the US but the Toronto experience was not up to snuff. Yes it's exciting to see the Cheese Cake Factory in T.O but I was seated by the manager at the bar area for lunch. He forgot to give us our menus so immediately the bus boy acused me hostility telling I can't sit their on my own I have to be seated. I told him the manager seated me and I am waiting for the rest of my group. Then the waitress did the same thing. I was so upset. I had been their less than 5 minutes and ruidly approached by two staffers. Acusing me that I sat their on my own accord. So then the waitress chases the young blonde man who was, I believe to be the manager. She comes  to the table and said sorry unsincerely. The manager knowing didnt even apoligize. My experience was tarnished. I told here she is ruining my experience and that I was upset. I don't even want to talk about the food because it was subpar to the US location I have been to and the wait for food was super long. Overall super disappointed."}
{"text":"This location is completely hit or miss. Both food and service are extremely inconsistent compared to other locations. 

We have dined here multiple times, one being last night (6/30/2016) about 90 minutes before closing. My husband ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and was served the Chicken Carbonara. He received the correct dish after I finished eating. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles, which were over-fried. The mashed potatoes were reheated so badly that they were glued to the plate. At that point, I didn't even have the energy to complain about my meal since we already had to send my husband's order back since it was incorrect. 

I love the Cheesecake Factory and will definitely return to other locations, but this one is comparable to a glorified Chili's.

UPDATE 7/29 (over a month later): I have reached out to this location twice regarding this recent visit and haven't gotten a response."}
{"text":"I really dig this place. It presents a lively atmosphere with huge portions of food that are reasonable for the prices you pay. Don't be alarmed by the $14 cheeseburger, it's a nice portion and higher quality ingredients than your average chain restaurant. The cheesecakes are amazing, and they even have an Atkins-friendly low carb cheesecake that's made with Splenda and a crushed nut crust! It's crazy good. 

Why do I frequent this restaurant? They have an understanding of special food and diet requests. I live a low carb lifestyle and it's so easy to make substitutions here. Salad, broccoli, spinach or green beans instead of fries? No problem. No bun? They'll lettuce wrap it! My new \"thing\" is to get the chicken pasta with spinach instead of pasta. Yes, the kitchen will easily accommodate special orders. It might take a lot longer to get your food (my last visit there resulted in a wait time of nearly 55 minutes from the time I placed my order 'til the food arrived), but at least the cooks get it right. 

Minus a star because of three problems: 1. The usual slow service: it shouldn't take nearly an hour for food to come out of the kitchen when the restaurant is 3/4 full 2. The always dirty and gross bathrooms: Yuck, clean up more often, please! 3. The tables: if you get stuck at a tiny one, get ready for the nosy snobs next to you to be all up in your eatin' business."}
{"text":"The service was great.. place was clean.. food was good, no complaints with any of that will go there again.. the only gripe I have is that for the class and setting of restaurant I was put off by the fact that they gave packs of butter on a tray w the bread.. I would expect any place that offers bread to serve a cup of soft butter. Not packets..  an Olive Garden I went to did the same thing very set off by that .. it is something that matters to me .."}
{"text":"The service was amazing my server was always around helpful has a great vibe but the food was not worth the price the food was bland I had the gumbo and i love gumbo how you miss season gumbo is beyond me the cheese cake is amazing if you want cheesecake this is the place if you want food do not eat here"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch and what a mistake that was. I ordered the gluten free skinny ceasar salad. I was happy they had an option for me. I received my salad and 3 bites in I found a BUG in my salad. I was shocked and disgusted. The waiter was shocked as well and took my salad. About 5 minutes later the manager came over and gave me a fake smile and apology that was very procedural. She offered me something else but why on earth would I want anything else from this place. I am very limited as to what I eat and this was one of the only options for me. I sure didn't want another salad with BUGS in it. Yes, I get it- it's lettuce and bugs like lettuce but they should be washing their lettuce more thoroughly to avoid this disgusting situation. I had to sit the rest of the meal while others in the party ate their meals which were not salad. As a person in customer service, the manager did not go out of her way to rectify the situation. She could have offered a discount on the rest of the bill. She took the salad off the bill but of course she would, I did not eat it and this was their fault. When we left the same manager was standing near the exit and she turned her back when she saw us leaving. Did not say another word to us. This is horrible customer service at it's finest. I will not ever go back to this place and urge others to be aware of the BUGS in the salad. To all the restaurants out there, when it is your fault someone's meal goes terribly wrong it is your responsibility to make things right. Had they discounted the rest of the bill or heck even offered to cover the bill themselves maybe I wouldn't have written this review! Customer Service should be a priority to make the customer's want to visit again. Cheesecake Factory ruined my day with my family."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is great! I have tried at least 10 of them. I defnitely recommend splitting one slice between 2-4 people! For the price, amount, flavor and calories its a great idea! Last night I tried the lemon raspberry cheesecake! Not too lemony and the raspberry sauce was great!! Always a ton of extra whipped cream!!!
I tried the fried avocado rolls last night and they were good. The dipping sauce for them was even better! There were 6 slices per the appetizer. The seared ahi tatini was delicious but very small compared to the rest of their salads and was therefore a little overpriced for the size but the fish and dressing did taste great. 
My grandparents had the seared salmon with veggies and potatoes. They said that it was amazing! The vegetables had great flavor! The hot chocolate was a very deep chocolate and the whipped cream was good but not quite hot enough! The service was pretty good but if you plan on coming here, avoid the weekends!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for filet mignonette. The salad is absolutely the best I have ever tasted. The service was extremely wonderful . They make you feel special. No matter how busy, you are treated as if you are their only customer. A hint, like a special cheesecake ? Try the Celebration. It is delicious enough if you took some home, you will wake up and eat it. From Janelle Lowrance."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit here and I enjoyed it. The menu has so many choices ranging from fried chicken, asian cuisine and sea food. I got the truffle-honey chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious! I recommend it. They also have a wide variety of cheese cake to pick from (over 20 types). I got the Chris's outrageous cake which is chocolate coconut cheesecake. It was rich and sweet... really hit the spot! The wait time was longer then expected but it was a Friday after noon which is typical. The service was speedy and our waitress was great. The prices are on the high end for the quality of the food but it was a great meal."}
{"text":"I really hate reviews on Yelp that don't even mention the food, but I had such a bad experience that I really do feel compelled to share.

We showed up at around 11:40 on a Wednesday and although there was a big crowd milling around outside the doors, we peeked inside and noticed a lot of empty tables, so we figured they must've been waiting for the valet.

We walked inside and indeed passed a number of empty tables en route to the front desk area. I was immediately faced with a surly woman who asked what I wanted, to which I responded a table for two. Without ever smiling, she pointed us back from whence we came.

Okay, fine, so we went back outside and this time we did notice a little stand with a small lineup. Again, there was an unsmiling woman dealing with customers and we overheard her tell a party of two that there would be a 75 minute wait. A 75 minute wait even though there were plenty of free tables!

As my dining partner remarked, it was total clown shoes.

I can only imagine that the joint is being completely mismanaged, because how else do you explain the dozens of empty tables and proliferation of unfriendly staff? It's bizarre.

I'll never return, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Starting with the most important factor at the Cheesecake Factory, their cheesecake is amazing. When you're reading the list of choices, some of them sound not-so-appealing, but I went out on a limb and had the Carrot Cake Cheesecake... ah-maze-ing.

The service at this location is great; very attentive. Their serving sizes are very big, allowing you to eat half at the restaurant and take the other half home for a yummy lunch the next day at work. The reason that I didn't give it 5 starts is because of the price. It's not a place that I can say I'm in love with because I can't afford to go there more than a every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Normally I am a fan of eating here but after this visit I may have to rethink that. We arrived here later in the day, close to closing time. We were seated outside to enjoy the nice AZ night heat which was great. Our server came out and was great all throughout the night! Our food however was not so great. Let me just say that our peach Balinis were the only good thing about the meal. We ordered appetizers which were spicier than usual. So we didn't even finish those. Our food, we ordered a fish plate, the fish was super dry and lacked taste which was disappointing. We only ate about a third of it because it was so bad. We did order a slice of cheesecake for dessert which was on point (as it should be). Overall the experience was not great but I rate it 3 stars for the awesome service and good drinks and cheesecake! But I probably won't be back again due to the lack of flavor in the food."}
{"text":"I was ready to realllly not like this place...and, you know what, I liked it!  A lot.  Food was tasty and inexpensive, the scenery was gorgeous, and the service was just about spot-on.  I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before yesterday and certainly had no complaints about this one.

This restaurant, in SouthSide Works' beautiful Town Square, couldn't have scored a better location.  I doubt they're ever hurting for business!  Your parking garage or valet ticket, by the way, can be validated here.

My opinion is that The Cheesecake Factory is a place for burgers and sandwiches and salads and the obvious--cheesecake!  That being said, we stuck to inexpensive menu items and were very happy with our food.  I just don't see \"The Cheesecake Factory\" as a place where I'm merrily going to drop over $20 for a lunch or dinner entree.  That's silly to me; there are numerous delicious nearby places where one can enjoy a more lavish meal. 

My mother, brother, and my brother's fiancee all seemed to love their yummy-looking food, but my boyfriend's \"Sonoma Burger\" (from the \"Glamburgers\" section of the restaurant's massive menu) was particularly delicious.  Super-juicy, maybe a bit too greasy, and topped with thin red onions, oven-roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, arugula, herbed goat cheese, and mayo.  I haven't had a burger in years, but this one made me reconsider my burger-eating frequency.  I also loved my \"Factory Chopped Salad,\" loaded with ingredients.  My only issue--and shame on the chef!--was that the bitter hard avocado used was days away from being ripe, yuck.  

Our server John was kind, helpful, and attentive.  Nice guy.

You know, it does bother me that--and it's no secret--The Cheesecake Factory generally serves super-unhealthy dishes.  Yahoo.com is my computer home page, and each time a \"Top 10 Unhealthy Restaurant ____\" article is featured, Cheesecake Factory menu items are all over the list.  Sort of bums me out, but then again the place IS called \"The Cheesecake Factory,\" which doesn't particularly conjure thoughts of healthful eating.

When dessert time rolled around yesterday we were stuffed and, thank goodness, avoided the featured red velvet cheesecake and its alternating layers of cheesecake and red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting glory.  It was very tempting though, as were basically all of the rich decadent cheesecakes this place has to offer.

A perfectly pleasant lunch experience in pretty SouthSide Works!"}
{"text":"We waited forever on the food. All 3 dishes cane out at different times. It was a mess. The manager never apologized. The waiter tried to make it right but was not successful."}
{"text":"Inexpensive for Vegas.   The food was decent, waitress friendly but a bit slow.   Not sure if it was anyone's fault as it was really busy.  Large menu, will have something to please everyone in your party.   Portions are large so I didn't get any cheesecake but the all looked amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a huge supporter of the cheesecake industry in general, and The Cheesecake Factory has like 40 or so different varieties of cheesecakes so you're bound to find, like, at least one variety that suits your cheesecake needs.  One caveat: The original plain slice of cheesecake will run you 870 calories (cherry cheesecake is 1100 or so) and that's compared to the 1300 calorie Ceasar salad.  So if you're looking to eat healthy, order the cheesecake.  They offer warm bread upon request, but you won't know how many calories you are consuming, it's not gluten free, and the butter is served in cold foil wrapped rectangles.  I suggest they serve the butter room temp as it made the bread get cold when I prefer my bread warm.  That said, I don't go to the Cheesecake Factory for it's high caloric menu of appetizers and entrées; I go for the cheesecake.  The decor is oddly Egyptian and online I've read others remark that their lighting motif looks like the Eye of Sauron (Lord of the Rings reference for those who don't know). 

They also have locations overseas, including Saudi Arabia, and I'm not saying the CF is supporting oppressive laws against women but what I am saying is Saudia Arabia and Egypt have an uneasy relationship; And CF being in SA makes me feel somewhat uneasy.  And in SA they don't serve alcohol, which is sad because another reason I go to CF is to indulge in fine adult beverages.  And yes, you can eat cheesecake at the bar.  I highly suggest The Cheesecake Factory because if you get cheesecake anywhere else it probably won't include a menu providing transparent information about calories, or if some item can be made gluten free, or that 2,000 calories is the recommended daily calorie intake (and some CF menu items go above and beyond that goal).  So go here, get some cheesecake!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I was enjoying a birthday celebration with my sister. Our birthdays are days apart. She suggested this establishment. I do not like cheesecake but we gave it a try for lunch. We waited a bit long to be seated. The cake display was nice. The seating arrangement is tight. To close to the stranger next to ya. I ordered shrimp scampi. This is my favorite dish. I was so disappointed . My shrimp was rubbery and bland. The plating was sad. There was 5 medium sized shrimp around a pile of dry tasteless pasta. Seriously! For almost $20.00 you need to receive a really fantastic lunch. It was our birthday celebration so I did not mention this to our party of 4. If I would of been with my husband or my son I would of ask to see the chef. The look of the place and staff has that going for it but the food sucks.Our waiter was super nice and easy on the eyes. If the reputation your going for is a respectful, pleasantly clean higher end restaurant you need to follow through with a chef that cares about how his food taste and looks. Yes you go to your favorite place because of the staff I get that but the food is the whole reason from the start."}
{"text":"I love the size of the menu at Cheesecake Factory. There's a dish for everyone here. The 3 star review is for stale bread served at this location. Usually the sour dough and dark bread is moist and delicious. Our bread was cold and stale. It was almost impossible to choke it down. Disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix from the Midwest and stopped here for the first time. My wife and I had light meals. She had the beets and goat cheese salad. She loved it! I had the lettuce wrap chicken appetizer as my meal. The wraps were fantastic. The only complaint was the service was slow and not particularly friendly. Our server was not at all apologetic for the slowness. Otherwise it was great!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if you didn't have to wait so long to get a waiter or to even order more things. Other than that I can't complain this location has a beautiful outdoor patio view and of course amazing food."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! It's so nice and lovely! My friend took me here for my birthday and the food was amazing not to mention the exceptional customer service! This place is to live for!!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Cheesecake Factory food, but can't give 5 stars just solely based off of the poor service we received. Daniel was our server last night and there were multiple times during our meal that we felt as if he forgot about us. Just to preface it, we went at around 7:30pm-definitely NOT peak hours or we probably would have been more understanding. 

At the beginning of the meal, Cheesecake Factory always gives bread with butter when you get your drinks. We got our drinks, ordered our appetizer, and then the bread came with the appetizer. Since we were too busy eating our nachos, the bread didn't get even touched. Such a waste of perfectly good food! 

Someone else delivered our dinner to our table (this is pretty normal for here so we weren't alarmed). Our sodas were only refilled once during the meal and by the end of the meal, they were bone dry. We asked our waiter for boxes and dessert menus and he took our food away and packed it up. The part that made us extremely uncomfortable was when he was walking back with the menus and food, he stopped within sight of our table and chatted it up with a coworker-nothing work related. We can see you, and we've been waiting on you for the entire meal! 

Lastly, when we ordered our cheesecake, he asked if wanted glasses of water. Since we ordered a super sweet cheesecake, we said sure! It was really nice of him to ask. He got caught up talking to the table next to us, and when he brought the cheesecake, he forgot the water. Literally on our last bite of cheesecake, he slammed down a big glass of water and apologized. 

We asked for NOTHING difficult. We had no special orders and were super kind when he would say things like \"thank you for your patience\". With his knowledge of the menu and the restaurant, there's no way he's a new employee. The service that we got was horrific for a meal that ended up costing us about 70 dollars for 2 people. We love the food (and the food this time was excellent too), but poor service ruins it. There are far too many competitors around the valley to allow anything less than great service."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went here for my step moms graduation. Had to speak with the manager before they would confirm our table. He was dealing with a bathroom issue so it took almost 30 minutes to get ahold of him. Then ALL of the buzzers went off so we had no idea who was getting a table. This was after  an additional 30 minutes but that's expected. Then our male waiter was very unwelcoming and inattentive. We had a female that would check on us and she was sweet but the man messed up the mood. My dads order was wrong and he did not get his food until we were boxing up our food. The food was not the same quality as I have had before. I think since it was so crowded they were rushing. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Good place, if you're a tourist. 

I wanted to like this place better but it's just typical corporate. 

Yeah food is good, you won't go wrong but - I will say this. They really should lessen the menu. It's overbearing to look through 50-60-70 things. 

A great restaurant offers less but greater value. 

Of course the cheesecake is good. But nothing beats grandmas. 

I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Was here on a Friday evening. Dropped by to put my name down, then went back an hour later for a pager. The wait was like 1.5 hours? The closest location would be the one in Buffalo NY, which I went a few times (big portions but food was below par). I didn't have high hopes when I came here for dinner. But I was surprised by the food at this Toronto location, it's surprisingly good compared to the buffalo location. The Cheesecake is on the sweeter side though. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta, tacos & coffee cheesecake. I would come back again if there was no lineups."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes. The food is consistent and come in large portions so leftovers are expected unless you share with you table. 

Of course while in Rome.... You must try their cheesecake. Personally, I am a purist and like the plain vanilla cheesecake."}
{"text":"The food is consistent and very good. I have 2  favorites, louisiana pasta and the southwest chicken salad. Both are always excellent however I have noticed the amount of chicken in the lunch salad has become smaller. The portions are too large so my wife and I often split an entree. The vanilla bean cheesecake is perfect and during the holidays the pumpkin is worth a trip. 
The bad. They can't make a cocktail to save their life.you have to chill the martini glass first and if the alcohol is an inch below the rim you've done something wrong. I have attempted drinks here 3 times. Never again.
Service is usually top notch."}
{"text":"First off I love Cheesecake Factory!! This location is great and never too busy! Our server was Tracy, she was EXCELLENT in customer service, gave us details and recommendations. Everything came out fast, hot and delicious! Tracy was very friendly and always smiling making sure everything was good. Overall, phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Try the Sunday brunch chilaquiles with carnitas they were amazing! my parents both had the breakfast combos and I tried one of their pancakes which in my opinion were perfection. 5 stars to the pancakes!  my parents were both very impressed."}
{"text":"Food took a while to come out but altogether everything was good. Atmosphere is nice and they play good music. Server was pleasant."}
{"text":"I lined up on a Monday at 11:00. The restaurant opens at 11:30. Now that's dedication. I was absolutely determined to eat here! I ended up sitting at 12:15 - they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen so they seat tables slowly.

Beware if you come in a big group - they do not reserve for tables bigger than 7. You would need to split your group into two tables and based on the lines, unfortunately there is no guarantee on where they will be sitting (may not be close to each other). Luckily I lined up early enough to get first pick of the tables and the hostess kindly arranged for our two tables to be together.

Now onto the food. Yes these are big portions but you are definitely paying for it. The pasta I got costs $25 but it doesn't not feel like it's worth the $10 extra for a bigger portion. You are definitely stuffed from eating one entrée. Food wise, definitely good for a chain restaurant but there is more focus on quantity than quality. 

I really liked the cheesecake. I tried the tiramisu cheesecake - so surprised by how light it was! I think the slice looks smaller than the states but it was good! Would definitely get cheesecake takeout next time.

Id definitely be back for cake but I don't think I'll be lining up again..."}
{"text":"Went to Cheesecake Factory today and got the bacon bacon cheeseburger which was good but the bread they give out which is normally soft and delicious but today is was hard and burnt. I told the waitress and she said \" okay I will go get you fresh bread\" which rubbed me the wrong way since I'm not understanding how we didn't get fresh bread to begin with. The bread was clearly burnt on the bottom."}
{"text":"Despite being extremely packed we were sat down in a clean and ready booth. The food came out surprisingly fast. Way to have a solid team on point! Food was delicious and service was solid."}
{"text":"I had thought that since Cheesecake Factory was closely related to Lux Cafe (which I love) I'd go there and be very happy.

I ordered the closest thing to a Southwest Salad (that I normally get at Lux Cafe).  I was disappointed.  Tons of food on the plate.  It was just a little bland, and I felt like a cow in the pasture just munching away.  It really didn't have the kick I was looking for.

Prices are pretty high.

Service was good though.

I think I will just stick with Lux Cafe..."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about The Cheesecake Factory in my travels and on my recent trip to Charlotte I got a chance to visit one. I was immediately wowed by the general style of the place and felt like I should have worn something a little nicer. The staff was friendly and the menu was almost too big. Portions were decent and prices were about what you would expect. I got the Garlic Noodles with chicken and was surprised to find bones in the chunks of chicken they put on. Then came the cheese cake, which was fantastic. I would come here again, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"Great service great food!  We went on national cheesecake day. I took my three young nephews. The server couldn't be nicer to them. I had the chicken Parmesan sandwich and the boys had pizza and wings. They love their meal and so did I! We also had the buffalo chicken meat balls for the appetizer. Delicious. I have nothing negative to say about this place. Oh and almost forgot the best part, the cheesecake! Amazing. Hershey's chocolate yum!!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is an excellent choice whenever you're not quite sure what you have a taste for.   Every location seems to be as popular as the next and there's almost always a wait. However, it's always well worth the wait.  We arrived and it seemed as if the parking lot was completely full. Upon entering, we were told there would be a 10 minute wait. This was perfect, a 10 minute wait gives an opportunity for winding down just prior to your meal.

The hostesses Michelle and Kelli greeted us with a huge smile's and we're very cordial.  After about five minutes of waiting our name was called and we were seated.  Our waiter, Todd was nothing short of amazing.  We didn't have drinks however ordered right away.  I was considering something different so I tried the Shepherds Pie. Yum Yum!  My friend had Shelia's Chicken and Avocado Salad.  Both meals were absolutely amazing. I can hardly wait to try the Shepherds Pie again.

This location is just outside Las Vegas (The District), is tucked away nicely and I encourage everyone to try it."}
{"text":"The last time will be the last time. 
Yesterday at CF, waiter was passable. He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer, and did not do so until asked. 
Food and drinks were good. 
However, at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels. Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched. Waitress did not initially apologize but stated, \"It's just a spill.\" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband, shirt, wheelchair and wheels. We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle. 
The manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning; then the waitress said she was sorry. No comp, no apology until we cleaned up ourselves. 

Even worse; two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same place,and another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched. 
This was weird deja vu.  

Maybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible, and they don't know their limit until they exceed it. Ha. 
Overall, food was good and service was sub par. Attitude was LOUSY! 
The customer who is paying about $25.00 per person ought to be treated as a guest and with courtesy. 

Better luck when seated at the bar, on past visits. No spillage."}
{"text":"Excellent cheese cake . Food is a bit overpriced in my opinion. Around 14$ for a salad and other lunch entrees is a bit aggressive . The drinks are good though and hey make a pretty solid Long Island . The avocado egg rolls are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Terrible. Nuff said. Horrible service, horrible food. Shocking because The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite go to spots. Never again in NC! Happy to be back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of my favorites restaurants, love the dulce de leche cheese cake is amazing my food was ok!!  We always go back to this location"}
{"text":"The Factory of Cheesecake

Always a good call if your unsure of what your looking for. Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that has one of those huge menus where if you can't find something to eat, clearly your not hungry or having some of interstellar hunger breakdown.

Having been to cheesecake in a few locations around the states this Factory has all the bells and whistles you come to expect from any other franchise.

Ordering the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and the Chopped salad for our main we dived straight into the massive portion of food. Make sure to always come hungry. They have a small kids menu as well as high chairs for the kiddos!! 

Since the Mains are pretty big my suggestion is try to order the small dishes if your looking for the amazing cheesecake! My favorite cheese cake is the Carrot Cheese cake. Some of the chocolate cheesecake can be pretty amazing as well. Also if your not a Heavy cream person let them know as they like to stack a massive cream side to your cake. 

As for service, expect a line if your coming at peak times, usually 7 days of the week this Cheesecake Factory is busy so don't be surprised when you might have to wait a while.

Overall a great place and can be recommended for almost any occasion"}
{"text":"Good for cakes!!

Food....humm my problem with restaurants here is that as food options, they are always limited. Sandwiches, pizza, soup, salads or pasta. So we tried pasta Da Vinci and Chicken picata. The second one tasted better, the first hummm not that good. 

Next time will stop ONLY for cake!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous! I ordered curbside and arrived when I was told my order would be ready. I let them know when I arrived; figured they'd be out in 5 mins since the girl said someone will be right out. I called when 10 mins went by, then again at 20 mins. Was told that a manager and the bakery was notified that I was there and waiting. From the time I ordered it took them 40 mins to get 3 pieces of cake ready. I'm pretty sure the whole point of curbside is that someone is in a hurry. Will NEVER be going here for any reason again."}
{"text":"The wait is always long (unless you get there before noon on Sunday, then not so bad). The servers are usually experienced and very good. The extensive menu has been perfected over the past twenty years (good gawd, I am getting OLD!) and the drinks are usually strong and comparably priced.

As much as I loooove good cheesecake (really, I'd eat it off the floor a'la Friends) I rarely get any b/c I'm so stuffed from my Chinese Chicken Salad (or Caesar), the addicting bread & butter and sampling whatever delish dish my hubby ordered. Maple glazed pork tenderloin is excellent (and I do not eat pork.) Spicy Cashew Chicken has been a favorite of mine for years. However, when I do get dessert I will likely order the ADAM's PB CUP FUDGE RIPPLE. Oh sweet jesus..if I were still single, this cheesecake could easily make up for the lack of a man!

Cheesecake Factory is great for dates, brunch (HUGE omelets), girl's night out and business meetings. The only reason I did not give this location five stars is b/c (in my opinion) it's hard for any chain to achieve that status but most important, they did not go above/beyond w/a very special request to just this once take a reservation from an out of country visitor. The woman flew all the way from Trinidad, here's her passport and ticket, just got off the plane and the first thing she wants is to eat there; can we NOT make her wait two hours??? I spoke w/the manager a few days ahead of time and he wouldn't make any effort to help. As a long term customer I was very disappointed in his lack of customer service and that has stayed w/me...I haven't been back since. :("}
{"text":"New year eve me and my wife went to eat something and enjoy the early night.
The hamburger was a well-done but burn and didn't taste so good and through them about 45 minutes to serve us the food.
Maybe because it was a New Year's Eve but still took them so long and the food didn't text so good this time."}
{"text":"I really think the cheesecake factory here at the Cesear palace location is much better than the one in Boca Park, Summerlin.  The food is seasoned better and the portion seems bigger too. Will be coming here from now on, even if it is a longer wait."}
{"text":"My family and I (party of 6) dinned in on a Sunday afternoon and had a great experience.  

The service was outstanding.

Our server was Marisa and we couldn't have asked for a more patient and kind person to help deliver our overall experience.  I have an uncle who at time can be a handful with his request and can be extremely talkative. She handled him in the best way possible which relieved some of my anxieties. 
The only room for improvement was the hostess. She didn't deliver the service standards that Cheesecake factory is known for.  

The food was solid across the board and everyone was satisfied with their meals.

Thank you Marisa for the great service and for ensuring my family had another memorable experience at the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"For as huge this place is, and the fact that it's usually packed beyond belief, they do a damn good job! I usually end up going in pretty late, but they never make us feel rushed or like we're keeping them there late. Whether I sit at the bar or we grab a booth, service is pretty quick and friendly!

My favorite drink is the Strawberry Creamsicle that comes with a fresh strawberry on top [the menu doesn't tell you, but it has whipped cream on top too]. I still eat like I'm 5, so it's always nachos or chicken for me and occasionally steak. The food can be hit or miss, honestly. I've gotten some pretty dry chicken and once my friend sent back 2 different dishes. I really don't prefer to send things back, but I on one occasion I did send back my mid-rare steak that came out so well done that it was hard for me to chew (nbd). The manger comped it for me and was sincerely super nice!

If you read my other reviews you'll notice that I prefer the divey, down-home types of places. For being a chain, I really do like Cheesecake!"}

{"text":"Ordered takeout, as we have before. Given a 35 min window, which seemed reasonable. Arrived 10 mins early and food was already good to go. Got home and it was cold. Not lukewarm. Cold. No bread. Kids sliders are tiny...less meat than a McDonald's burger. Will not order takeout again -only the overpriced cheesecake because it is good!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night with my wife and another couple.  I was expecting there to be a huge wait, but we were pleasantly surprised that it only took us 20 minutes to get a table.  The inside is impressively decorated and the lighting is a bit darker inside. 

The menu is a bit overwhelming here.  Too many things to choose from, but in the same breath you can come back frequently and never get the same thing.  Everything on the menu sounded appetizing, and my wife and I settled on two different types of pasta.  Mine was supposed to be a spicier pasta, but it really didn't have much kick to it.  My wife liked hers which had peas, bacon, and Alfredo sauce. It wasn't anything spectacular but they do give you a healthy portion.  The bread that came with the meal was fairly good.  The couple we came split fried chicken and mashed potatoes as well as a salad.  I was a little more envious of their meal than mine.  For dessert, we had the Tuxedo cheesecake in a to go box which for sure exceeded my expectations.  

Overall, this is a very expensive place to go eat at.  Our meal was around $60 for 2 dinners and a dessert.  I'm not opposed to come back, but if I'm going to spend $60 for dinner I will go somewhere nicer.  I think the menu does have items that are reasonable and that I would look to get if I end up going here again.  The cheesecake is for sure excellent, so I wouldn't hesitate to stop in to pick up dessert sometime."}
{"text":"Look at the forks they gave us! Really?? YUCK. Make sure your utensils are clean before you use them."}
{"text":"We love The Cheesecake Factory it never disappoints.  Everything they have is amazing.  Today in honor of national cheesecake day we decided to dine here for date night.  I had the pear and endive salad from their low calorie menu. It is not on the regular menu,  I allowed for a side of balsamic dressing as the low cal version is tasty but needed a tad more.  I'm not a drown your salad type of salad eater but adding a spoonful more didn't hurt anything, the salad was fantastic.  My hubby had the Imperial chicken dinner with white rice and fried shrimp.  The chicken was delictible it melted in my mouth.  Because we were going to get cheesecake we didn't order or normal appetizer which is the avocado egg rolls.  If you ever want something off the chart order some of these and you will be happy you did.  The new location was convenient to shopping and parking.  The soda  machine was out so we ordered water with lemon it was very good not that normal yuck restaurant water..  We got the cheesecakes to go and we are super stuffed.  Oh yeah please request James as your waiter, he was amazing and we were so impressed with his service and suggestions.  He made our meal even more enjoyable we will be back."}
{"text":"My husband loved his meal, Garlic Noodles with Chicken. I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and thought it was just okay. Not enough dressing at all.

My only other complaint is the ambiance. It was like eating in a cafeteria. The crowd was loud and the music playing was so soft that I could barely hear it."}
{"text":"Great food but busy service. They took a really long time to get our orders and get our checks. I ordered their popular shepherds pie and it was delicious, my friend ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was really good as well. The star of the day was the cheesecake of course. I ordered the lemon raspberry cheesecake and i don't mean to exaggerate but it was the best cheesecake i've ever had."}
{"text":"La hamburguesa estaba muy roja. Se hizo la queja pero no hubo una acción satisfactoria. 

Después de unos minutos, ellos hicieron el descuento de la hamburguesa. Paso a"}
{"text":"We sat a place in a circular room and the waiter there kept calling us boss which we don't like, and then someone closed the blinds when we wanted them open.  We told  David to close them, but it kept going up and down it was annoying.  We told him we were not happy, and then the manager comes and talks to another table to ask them how they are doing, what about us? 

The situation was bad, and when we asked the manager about it, she said that she wanted to get the table sat and really did not care about what other people thought basically.  

Well avoid the place, they are more concern with filling tables than customer service."}
{"text":"It's like any other Cheese Cake Factory. Parking isn't a problem since it's at the mall. Wait times can be long. 
We like to swing by and grab some cheese cake to go. You can get in and out quickly that way and have a nice desert for home."}
{"text":"I think the Cheesecake Factory is ok.  Nothing magical, but nothing terrible you know?  I went in on Labor Day at 2:00 thinking the crowd would have died down....but guess again it was freakin packed!!!

30 minute wait, which I guess in the grand scheme of Cheesecake Factory wait times wasn't too bad.  The people watching during the wait is always interesting and the massive amounts of food and cheesecake that pass me always make me wonder what kind of money this place makes.

The service was great, very attentive and friendly.  One thing I do like is the variety of food offered which is both good and bad, I guess.  We had the avocado eggrolls which are pretty tasty, I don't want to know how many calories were in them but nice chunks of avocado fried in an egg roll wrapper were complimented by a sweet and spicy dipping sauce.

I had the mushroom burger which frankly was very good.  It was well put together with very flavorful mushrooms and swiss cheese.  The cover the burger in some kind of wine sauce which was welcomed.  Fries....nasty.  Too much salt ruined them.

We skipped on the cheesecake (I know, blasphemy) but I figured I gorged on too many calories as it was and wanted to be able to look myself in the mirror afterwards."}
{"text":"Had the half turkey sandwich lunch special with french onion soup and a caesar salad. Everything was wonderful from the food to the customer service"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory, aka 'Ole Trusty.

You don't come here for their culinary prowess or ambiance. You come here for the giant portion sizes,1000+ calorie slices of cheesecake and wear stretchy pants and flip flops without judgement.

The menu is outrageously huge, so even your adult sister with the palate of a 5 year old will find something that they will not complain (too much) about.

So glad to have this, not really a factory, factory, in town."}
{"text":"Definitely not a good experience - the food was decent, well, our appetizers at least.  The entree was nothing we couldn't have gotten inside the mall at the food court. The waitress was sweet as could be but admittedly kept forgetting us, we had to ask/remind her for everything from bread to silverware to even ordering the entree. We decided to order our cheesecake on our own at the front register thinking it'd be faster....  Twenty minutes later we regretted that choice. Our overall dinner started at 830 and it took us until 11 to walk out the door.. Last trip to this restaurant for us."}
{"text":"Staying in Henderson this Cheesecake Factory was the first I've visited which I didn't have to wait for seating at dinner. I was seated at a booth which I requested and was comfy.

My friendly waitress greeted me asap and gave me a menu with the large variety of choices to choose from. I ended up going with the Salmon Miso which was topped on steamed rice and served with pea pods. The fish was fresh & moist and the miso sauce went good when combined with the rice and pods. Instead of going with a fancy cheesecake I chose the original which was served with whipped cream. The cheesecake was silky smooth and creamy and not overly rich but filling.

Overall for me - the large variety of choices, good quality in a pleasant atmosphere make Cheescake Factory a solid choice to dine."}
{"text":"This location had the typical Cheese Cake Factory Experience. The service was average.  I believe they are over priced for the portion size."}
{"text":"Went to Cheescake factory last night with my family to celebrate my birthday. Long wait as to be expected but our service was excellent as were our meals. Huge portions and fairly priced. We will be back."}
{"text":"Like many newly married couples now a days, we couldn't afford a honey moon, but we can afford a nice night out. I've never been to the Cheesecake Factory before and my new mother in law actually got a cheesecake for our wedding last week from here and wanted to try it out. I was very excited to go because I've heard great things. We were seated quickly despite the rush time and outside which I was even more happy about. Our waiter maybe came to our table 2 times while the table  next to us got so much attention from their waiter it made me irritated but pushed it away. My husband got his food about 15 minuets before I got my tacos and they were cold even the rice that came with it. I was bummed because he waited for me to get my food before he ate and then his food was also cold. We rarely get to go out with having a child and demanding jobs and I was all around sad. BUT the manager Kevin came and listened to us and was so understanding and he gave us complementary cheese cakes and comped our meal, I will definitely give them another try"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and an expansive menue. The menue is more like a book to read. They treat you really nice on your birthday which is why I have gone there the past two birthdays. The portions are large but they do offer lunch sizes. There is almost always a long wait but it has a great bar to while away the time. Oh and the cheesecake is to die for....save room or make room!"}
{"text":"Best chain ever.

Yes, it's a chain and yes there's tons of local eats, but I argue that there is no place where a party of 20 people can get everything they're looking for, no matter what they like, what dietary restrictions they have and what they're in the mood for.

The mood lighting at night is great for a romantic dinner that isn't too intimate (no pressure!) or a nightcap and cheesecake (sexy!). The hours are later than most other places in the area, too, so if you're running to grab a bite after a movie or something, the Factory is a great option.

I tend to battle between getting the Thai Lettuce Wraps (fresh, quality, delish!) and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, no cucumbers, but almost always get both because I can't stop myself. Sure it's way too much food but these are things that I sometimes DREAM about. And sure there are vietnamese and thai places that carry the lettuce wraps in town but I've tried and every time I'm left yearning for that tamarind cashew sauce. 

BRB, drooling.
---------------

And, I'm back! So yes, the service is always attentive but the waits can be long, especially at peak dinner hours and all day Saturday & Sunday during mall hours. The bar is fully stocked, bathrooms always clean (and posh!), and the outdoor patio makes for a pretty nice summer lunch spot too. They've got a bar bites menu that's available to keep it light on the pockets, and of course more cheesecakes than should be legal to tempt you into ordering just 1..... ok, 2 slices."}
{"text":"The waitress was great, checked on us, refilled drinks when low and offered us a bread basket.
My husbands lemonade was really good. I had the black tea, which was also good.
The food, well it wasn't bad, nothing special. He had the Shepherds pie and I had the Chicken and biscuits.
Maybe it was just us, not use to eating rich foods. Both of us felt a bit bloated after we ate. His didn't have much flavor, mine was just okay.
It's not a bad restaurant, just not for us."}
{"text":"Cheesecake is in the name, so you know it will be good!

This is a great restaurant chain.  This location is huge with seating both inside and out.  They have the usual 30 page menu, so you will definitely find at least 1 thing, if not 10 that you want to try for lunch/dinner.  

The food tastes great as well.  My favorites are all appetizers.  I usually get 2 apps and enjoy a small feast.  My absolute favorites are the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, and the Buffalo Wontons.   All are winners and I recommend these to everyone who loves yumminess on a plate.

If you are in need of more food than some appetizers, you are in luck! They have everything from tasty pizzas, yummy sandwiches, and delicious entrees that could feed a small village.  If you can name it, Cheesecake Factory probably has it on their menu.

The desserts are fantastic here too!  I mean cheesecake is in the name of the place, so you know the cheesecake will be great!  The also have other desserts like cake and pie, but I have never tried them because I always go for cheesecake! DUH!  My favorite choices are the Chocolate Tuxedo, Dulce de Leche, and Key Lime cheesecake.  The Pumpkin cheesecake is fabulous, but you can only get that one in the fall.

The service is usually great and you can usually be sat pretty quickly, due to the massive amount of tables available.  It is a very consistent restaurant.  It seems no matter when you go, the food will always be the same.  They run this place like a well oiled machine and it is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Open Christmas eve!

They serve Patron Anejo !

And...

They have low carb cheesecake!"}
{"text":"We had lunch twice during my vacation in Vegas and both experiences were excellent! The staff was very friendly and attentive.  We were a group of 9 and we were still taken care of almost immediately. This location is inside the Venetian Hotel feeling like you are in Italy! We were also lucky enough to enjoy a show right before sitting down for lunch! If you are in the area I recommend for you to stop by and enjoy lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory and I love their location. All of their food and especially the bakery are amazing. I wish I could give their store 5 stars but unfortunately I have had not such good experience with calling in for take out food. I've tried it twice, one time I gave up after 20min being on hold and literally being transferred from one staff to another. The other time, finally after 15min I was able to place my other and pick it up. They need to improve their way of calling in their orders. Putting an order in in the store itself, and picking up is not a problem, but something is not working on the telephone end.

I like the ability of rapid pick up on the curb side of the restaurant. This place has a great location, and the ability to seat people inside, in the mall and outside. Their decor reminds me a Las Vegas casino - anything can happen.

Don't forgot to leave room for dessert as their portions are quite large."}
{"text":"This factory was in full production mode when I came in on Monday afternoon.  I mean it was really hopping.  I came in at 2:00 PM thinking I would have missed the lunch rush and beat the dinner rush.  It did work out that way.  I had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  I guess that is what happend when they offer cheesecake slices for half price.  Thats what brought me in.  Oh, and the prospect of a good lunch.

I was seated after waiting a while which I didn't fully mind.  I would have been fine sitting at the bar if it got me seated sooner but I had a nice table to myself when I was seated.  My serve came over right away and brought my bread and water out pretty quickly.  For my lunch I ordered the lunch size pasta DiVinci.  Afterall, it has MUSHROOMS!  It also has grilled onions, chicken and sauce.  I asked for some fresh grated cheese to top it.  This was not a bad bowl of pasta but it could have been better.  The pasta to chicken ratio seemed off.  The mushrooms were good.  The onion tasted burnt.  And there seemed to be a taste of burnt oil too.  It wasn't terribly off putting but it was noticeable.  The dish has a lot of potential but I think the kitchen was bitten by the mass crowds and suffered for it.  Regardelss, I saved some for later and also asked to have my left over bread packaged to-go.  This was a late lunch/early dinner.  I knew I would be hungry again before bed time.  So asking for a doggie bag was my way of planning ahead.  I also wanted to save room for the cheesecake that brought me in in the first place.

For dessert, I ordered a slice of tiramisu cheesecake.  That combines two of my favorite desserts into one delectable sin on a plate.  Coffee soaked lady fingers for a crust, soft and fluffy cheesecake filling, a dusting of cocoa powder, and a dollup of chocolate whipped cream made this one delicious way to end my afternoon.  I'd order that in a heartbeat (possibly my last heartbeat at the rate I'm going with these dishes).  But there are so many other options to try.  This is the Cheesecake Factory, you know.  What kind of place would it be if it didn't have too many cheesecake options?  All the more reason to come back."}
{"text":"I got the Asian style lettuce wrap, and I felt it was well prepared. When I didn't like was the lack of customer service. The fact that I had to wave down a bus person twice just to get his attention. Then it seemed to take him another long period of time just to bring the glass of water I asked for him to refill. This was after spending my whole meal without water because it was not refilled....
I only complain about this because I worked as a bus person and I base my standards on the service I would provide. Overall rating would be: food - satisfactory customer service - unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Needed to try something new and I'm glad we did. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in over 10 years. The restaurant is huge , clean and booths are private . The food is good, not out of this world but good . Service was good. Portions are huge , definitely shareable . We got right in on a Friday evening around 5pm. We were seated and had drink orders taken within a couple of minutes . We ordered nachos and chicken avocado club sandwich with side salad . Everything was fresh and tasty . Next time I need to eat only 1/2 of my meal so I can have a piece of cheesecake ! Or , maybe next time we hit the mall we should pick up a couple slices of cheesecake ."}
{"text":"Some of my office mates and I came to Cheesecake Factory last week for one of their birthdays.  I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before so I looked at the online menu before we even left.  I wanted to have at least some kind of idea going in.  It did not take me long to choose the Renee Special lunch with a Ceasar Salad, chicken almond salad sandwich and the soup of the day, cream of mushroom.  I was very happy with all of it.  From quality to quantity, it was all enjoyable.  The salad, while a good Ceasar, was nothing special.  Just a salad done right.  The soup was crazy good.  I love mushrooms and mushroom soup. This was an interesting varient that was a littl less creamy than I am used to but loaded with mushrooms, carrots and some other bits of deliciousness.  The sandwich was abotu as good as the soup.  Even though it was chicken salad.  This wasn't the soggy mash of chicken salad your mama used to send you to school with. This was solid chunks of chicken with a bit of mayo and almonds.  It was very good and I would gladly order it again.  My one regret is not ordering a piece of cheesecake.  I love cheesecake and I was at the Cheesecake Factory.  How could I be so careless as to not order cheesecake?  I just have to shrug that off right now and go back again later.  I'll get my cheescake.  Beileve me I will."}
{"text":"Second time going here and second time getting horrible service. Ive done order to pick up and they always don't understand that I'm outside and transfer at least twice. The whole procees took 15 mins today and i only ordered 1 slice of cheesecake, just disappointing, so close to work but Im not going again and spending so much time just to pick up."}
{"text":"I ordered ligurian pesto pasta.. The pasta was overly uncooked.. And quantity was less compared to what I had 2 weeks before.. The server said they had changed the pasta.. Did not like the pasta at all.. I had enjoyed it last time though"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on the Cheesecake Factory. I have come to the conclusion that the Cheesecake Factory needs to find out what they want to be. Do you want to be a Mexican restaurant? A steakhouse? An American grill? Clearly this mix match of food and seven menu pages worth of choices has worked for them for a long time but my belief is that you can't do something great if you try to do 100 things at one time. Too many menu items! While variety is nice, the menu is overwhelming and the chef's have way too much room for error. My food has always been just okay here but it is clear to me why. I do love the cheesecake. It is my favorite dessert so that is of course ultimately why I come here. I generally decide to make a meal of it when I do come here and often just wonder why I didn't just go to The Keg across the street. Why have a mediocre steak when you could have an amazing one? For now I think I will just stick to The Cheesecake Factory's namesake. How did a dessert restaurant turn into a free for all of tex mex, steaks, burgers, pasta and seafood, oh my!"}
{"text":"My kids love CF.  The menu is ginormous, there's bound to be something on there for everyone. I personally like the Baja chicken tacos or Thai salad, they are on the lite menu. My hubby enjoys a few things, chicken masala, the burgers or the jambalaya are his usual picks. My daughters usually get the kids marinara pasta, the chicken dumplings (an appetizer, but they eat it as a meal) or nachos, which 2-5 can share. 
Of course, the cheesecake is what they really want, and it is pretty delicious if I do say, all 3577326786 calories a bite. It's not like we eat cheesecake everyday though, so it's okay. The chocolate lava cake is quite good, as well. 
Service has always been consistent and friendly, however, weekend nights be prepared to wait at least 30 for a table.
Prices are average for that type of restaurant, a couple cocktails, 4 meals, a cheesecake or ice cream is around $100. Minus tip. 
It's s go to for us on a Friday night after the kids sports stuff. 
And as the infamous quote by Marie Antoinette says, \"let them eat cake.\""}
{"text":"I know this place is a bit of a cliche, and yes, it's a chain, and blah, blah, blah, but I can't stop coming here.  Is it the 20 page menu?  The spacious establishment?  The delicious fresh bread that comes out while you wait for your entree?  Honestly, I think it is all those things, but for me, it's the one page \"skinny\" menu with the low cal/low fat options.  These healthy creations are not only tasty, but the portions are nice, and you have several options.  The \"Skinnylicious\" menu ranges from salads, to fish, to pasta, to steak, to tacos.  And the list goes on.  So yeah, I go to the Cheesecake Factory and I'm not mad about it.  

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that they have an amazing assortment of cheesecake.  I don't usually partake, but often I'm talked into sharing a piece with a friend or a group, and I've had some damn good cheesecake here.  My favorite is Oreo or cookie dough.  Or dulce de leche.  Or mango.  Ok, so maybe I do partake in the cheesecake.  But cut me a break, I saved oh so many calories by ordering from the Skinnylicious menu!"}
{"text":"We went Saturday night 10/11/14, at 7:30pm. Hostess estimated our wait at 10-15 mins. After 25, I asked where they were at with calling us and the hostess stated we were 2nd to be called. We waited in view as approximately 6 other parties were seated. At approximately 50 mins after first putting our name in we complained to the male manager (white male 50s) and he immediately sat us. He offered to immediately put in a couple appetizers while we were looking over the menu and got those out ASAP. He brought them out personally saying they had a cook standing by to quickly turn around our orders and those did come out quickly. The food was good as usual, nothing crazy, but still nice. Our waitress was also on top of things. They comped the appetizers. We appreciate the manager writing the wrong and his sincerity."}
{"text":"I'll start with the customer service, unfortunately this is what makes it 3 stars.  We had a big group of around 15 people, and yes, they do not take reservations but we did call to let them know about when a 15 people group would be there.

Long story short, there was no table for us when we got there, which is fine, but the hostess was so rude and said it will be an hour and forty five min., she said there was only one table that would fit that many people, we asked if they could push a few tables outside together and she said no.

My coworker got a little upset and asked to talk o the manager, come to find out the wait was not going to be even close to that long and they would push two tables together for us.  So the 1 and 45 min wait time suddenly was only 15 min!!!

Our waitress was great, very sweet and nice.  We came here as a part of our company Christmas party and we work in a restaurant so we sometimes can be hard to make happy, especially our servers lol but she did great and there were no complaints!!!

Food. was. soooooooo. good !!!!!!!!!!!!! omg!!! everyone ate everything off their plates!!!  Fast hot fresh food, great portion sizes and fair prices!!!

I will def go back!!!"}
{"text":"Tiramisu Cheesecake. Yummy. Even tastier when you have in an amazing locale as the Caesars palace."}
{"text":"Chain that mostly in larger cities. We are lucky to have one in Madison. For this particular location, it's mostly a hit with a few misses. Each time, the food is fantastic. The service is okay. Depends on the day and the server.

Food: So many options. Too many options. Great for picky eaters because they will find something. I recommend the chicken samosas and fried zucchini for apps. These are my go-to apps. The calamari was too greasy and over breaded (so much that the breading was not cooked all the way for some of the pieces). I love their pastas. The burgers are massive. Fries are always hot. Portions are large. I always have enough to have two extra meals the next day. Some of my favorites include the Cajun Chicken Littles. Tip: sub out the corn succotash for their Mac & Cheese. Do it. The bread to share for the table is free. Some times it's warm and some times it's not. 

Ambiance: it's low lit. There are a lot of tables. Bar looks nice High tops -- look uncomfortable. I recommend a booth because their chairs are not that comfortable. All weekends are crowded. There will always be a wait. Go a bit early so you can grab a pager and get on the list.

Service: Ok. This is where it's a miss sometimes. I understand that it gets busy. The last server I had was great in the beginning, but then it went a bit downhill. I asked for a glass of ice and it never came. Refills on drinks were not automatic. We had to ask each time for different people. Plates were never cleared unless they were boxed. This day, it was not busy so I am not sure what happened.

Overall --- good place for a group of people, a first date or a place to bring the kids. Lots of friendly smiles. Oh, of course-- the cheesecake is great. Linda's Fudge Cake. Try it. I am not a sweets person, but this cake might convert me."}
{"text":"I tend to stay away from chain restaurants but after calling other booked restaurants and not wanting a full meal we decided on CCF.  We had a salad and cake at the bar.  Our server/bartender was great...and cute.  

I would go back for lunch but I learned my lesson about making reservations early."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch. A little pricey but worth it. The food was good and so was the service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So overrated OMG. I order a pasta dish with shrimp, and my shrimps are cold as they come on shrimp cocktails. Cheesecake factory is nothing else but a wanna be high class restaurant for people with a huge illusion."}
{"text":"The Best Cheesecake on the menu is the Strawberry Lemon hands down.  Its got a bottom layer of cake that absorbs and holds the strawberry syrup.  Not too rich, and not too far from the classic cheesecake taste.  They can get too far away from cheesecake with stuff like the Oreo cheesecake, I'd rather just have Oreo ice cream at that point.

This CCF is in a great location in the district at Green Valley.  It is your standard CCF with really dim lighting.  Sit outside if you can because it's a lot quitter and scenic.

I tend to try to get Entrees that are more on the exotic side, it tends to pay off better than standard stuff.  The Jamaican Pepper shrimp is a celebration of flavors in your mouth.  I also like to get a post meal alcoholic shake like the flying gorilla.  Then sit around for another hour sipping it to annoy the waiter."}
{"text":"The place operates like a machine with formulated dishes brought to your table by android servers.  Went for lunch and ordered the four-cheese pasta and a vegetarian burger with sweet potato fries. Made one request to NOT have pickles anywhere near the burger. The server confirmed the no-pickle request, but surprise, surprise the burger was covered in pickle slices when it was delivered to the table. I CAN'T STAND THE TASTE and SMELL of them. They offered to take the burger back and remove the pickles. I ended up removing them myself, and cutting off part of the burger patty touched by the pickles. Having to reorder the food would have taken another 30 minutes I didn't have time for today. The waitress who took the order never apologized or acknowledged the issue. The sweet potato fries were as good as you expect, few people really know how to do them right anyway. They were undercooked inside and didn't have a hint of crunchiness on the outside. The four-cheese pasta was well received by my lunch mate. Order off the menu as is and you'll get the formulaic food, but don't order anything with a slight modification. It appears the robots in the kitchen or wait staff can't manage a simple request.  I wouldn't be so harsh had this been a one-time experience. It's the third this has happened so perhaps three is indeed enough."}
{"text":"It has been ages since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory. My last experience at the Chandler Mall location wasn't all that great, had no desire to go back. Yesterday I ended up however at the Kierland location. Arrived close to 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday and it wasn't busy yet (there was a line when we left). The service was perhaps the best we've ever received at this chain. The young lady was attentive, friendly and always there with a refill before we needed it. We ordered the Veggie Melt and the Four Cheese Pasta dish. The Veggie Melt was delicious and massive. It was 1 1/2 sandwich. I could only finish 1/3 of it, took the rest home. The Four Cheese pasta dish was a good classic you can't really mess up all that much. Sadly no room for cheesecake after. I ordered fries with my sandwich and they were a disappointment. I always think you are going to get the Yard House style fries here, but you get a pretty average bland fry. Not horrible, just average. I'd be back."}
{"text":"I remember excitedly trying The Cheesecake Factory eight years ago in Atlanta and have been enjoying this chain restaurant ever since! I work close to this location in South Side Works and really enjoy going here for lunch and cheesecake. However, I think their dinner entrees are a bit overpriced and underwhelming, and since the wait times can get long, I wouldn't personally get dinner from here.

Based on lunch and dinner, I would only rate this restaurant three stars. However, I think The Cheesecake Factory deserves four stars for the environment and desserts. I've enjoyed the majority of the cheesecakes that I've tried since first going here eight years ago, including -- Oreo Dream Extreme, Ultimate Red Velvet, Godiva, White Chocolate Raspberry, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake, etc. I highly recommend dropping by The Cheesecake Factory around 9-10pm on the weekend to eat cheesecake, have coffee or a drink, and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The best part of this Cheesecake Factory is its proximity to Ross Park Mall! When you're tired and hungry after a long afternoon of shopping, this is the perfect place to come. I actually love to get cheesecake to-go from here. Looking at the cases of cheesecakes always gets me salivating. Plus, when you take it home, you can snack on it for a day or two instead of just feeling very full all at once. I highly recommend getting an after-shopping snack from here!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory comes to us from our neighbours in the south and this Yorkdale location is the first in Toronto. Having visited the buffalo location, this Yorkdale location looked pretty much as I remembered it. We showed up just before they opened on a Saturday and barely waited though it was still busy for a Saturday morning.

The service was quick and efficient and we were served by Carol.

My other half got the fried chicken and waffles benedict while I went for the macaroni and cheese burger. We also got the crab bites as the appetizer.

The burger comes topped with creamy fried macaroni and chedder cheese balls.

The fried chicken and waffles comes with a belgian waffle with fried chicken strips, poached eggs and hollandaise with maple butter syrup on the side.

The crab bites were light and crispy on the outside and quite tasty. Though the sauce was described as a mustard sauce, it was more mayo then anything. Also the crab bites while tasty, barely had any crab (crab pollack) and the consistency and texture was more like canned flaky tuna. Still tasty overall for what it is, but not as advertised or expected.

The burger itself, while it was a unique combination and overall was tasty, it's not the best burger I have ever had. The bun was a regular hamburger bun, and thus made it messy to eat with all the juices and cheddar sauce. It would hold together better with a firmer bun, such as a pretzel bun. The deep fried mac and cheese was tasty and took the show while the burger patty itself was underwhelming.

The waffles chicken and poached eggs overall was tasty but suffered again when you break it down. The chicken strips were crispy but mainly consisted of batter, the poached eggs also came out over done. The hollandaise sauce was also not the best, likely because it's not freshly made. Hollandaise sauce must be made fresh for optimal taste day of, but unfortunately most restaurants make it in batch and store it. Some restaurants make a new batch once every other day, while others may make a fresh batch once a week which causes the sauce to suffer a bit in taste. Overall the dish was \"good\", but not as good as it could be

The cheescake factory has a wide wide array of unique combinations of food, though the food does suffer a bit of identity crisis. Was my burger good stand alone? It was ok. Was the mac and cheese good stand alone? Again ok. But overall it was tasty and it was a novelty but not sure if I would have it again.

Overall tasty, and quite filling - you do get what you pay for in terms of quantity. 

We ended off with a white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake. Well when going to a place that calls itself the cheesecake factory this did not disappoint!

Chunks of white chocolate and macadamia nuts in a bed of cheesecake topped with caramel and whipped cream. Boom. 'Nuff said.

If your on a diet do NOT come here! Otherwise this place totally stuffed me, service was excellent and overall things were tasty. Though if your looking for a gastronomic experience, this place is not  it, worth a try but not sure if I would go out of my way to come here to eat. If your looking for some out of this world cheesecake only, I would recommend you skip the line and headaches and grab a slice to go."}
{"text":"The cheesecake was obviously 5 stars, this is the Cheesecake Factory you'd expect with that name that they'd get that right at least. 

This may be the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. The waits are ridiculous, the traffic from the mall combined with the fact that it's the only Cheesecake Factory makes for exceptionally long waits throughout the day (despite many open tables within my line of vision). 

They are ridiculously over priced - especially for the quality of food. I'd say average at best, but nothing that warrants the price tag. The salmon is tasteless (they sell it as fresh lol). Chicken is dry, some pasta noodles were hard still towards the ends. Had a salad that cost me $13ish and was soggy as hell. 

Service is hit or miss.

Come here for the cheesecake, and that's all."}
{"text":"I've been to this cheesecake factory like a dozen times and it use to be great back in the day, but my recent visit was kinda blah.

I came with a friend last week to chat over dinner and we must have waited about a good solid 10 minutes before our waiter came to take our order.

Our waiter was friendly, but seemed to have way too many tables to tend to making hard on him to please everyone he was serving.

The poor guy was stretched thin and it was a bit hard trying to find him so we could get condiments to our table that he or his food runner had forgot to get.

My friend ordered the beef medallion with mash potatoes, which she liked very much. I ordered the lean burger with side salad and it didn't turn out the way I requested.

I wanted my burger well done and it was not and unfortunately my salad was not very fresh, but I ate my food anyway, because I was like starving already.

Overall I didn't really enjoy my food, but I'm more than willing to give this place another try and taste something else on the menu next time I eat here."}
{"text":"We were told it will be a long line up but we still came to try out the food and cheese cake.  We waited a total of 2 hours before getting the seats.  We were asked to order the cheese cake first because it will take 45 mins to bring out due to the long line up for cheese cake.  At the same time we have also ordered the main dish.  The food and services are fabulous.  I did not find any fault from it.  We plan to go there again for Sunday brunch.  It is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"We had a nice late lunch early dinner here last evening. I had marinara sauce and Angel hair pasta while my boyfriend had a chicken dish. My pasta was wonderful although it unusually served with some kind of bread it was not,  being they serve bread at the table for starters it was not a let down to me. My boyfriend really enjoyed his as well although the portion size was I'd say a lunch size. The cheesecake is of course to die for. We had salted caramel cheesecake and yum! I am not one to eat sweet treats often so it really hit the spot. They have so many different options on the menu. Something there for everyone. The service was good our waitress was  kind and very assertive. The manager even came by our table and saw we had ordered 2 biscuits that we didn't eat not do to them not being good it was just we were full he was kind enough to take them off the bill, even when we told him that was not necessary. I would return again for sure."}
{"text":"This location is located where my wife and I were outlet shopping.  Very convenient, spacious, and well decorated.  They have an extensive menu and the service is great.  We shared a bbq chicken salad and a combo entrée with chicken and beef.  We were so stuffed that we couldn't order any cheesecake.  We did however, look at cheesecake showcase to dream about it.  Next time, as from previous experiences, this is what they are known for."}
{"text":"They now have smaller lunch-sized portions (which are still enough for two and average 1300 calories). But it's still a smaller portion and a smaller price on top of that. 
Service is always excellent - staff bends over backward for you. How nice is that at a chain shop??"}
{"text":"Could be the waitress I've had the last two times I've been here, but my general feeling is that this place is rarely worth the money. We went for dinner after a Spring Training game and our waitress had difficulty splitting a bill in half (she hand wrote the totals on the original receipts..?). Service was slow but it was late and we had drinks and a group so it wasn't an issue so much. Food was meh.

Then I go in for lunch today, same waitress. I think \"oh great, this should be an adventure\" -- boy was I right. Took over an hour for 2 lunch portions and an appetizer for our table. Nothing complex, either (2 fish and chips and a baked artichoke). It seemed that the waitress had no concept of time -- likely because she was standing at the bar just inside talking to her coworkers while we burned up on the patio waiting for food. She also failed to bring out condiments we asked for -- I would have reminded her, but the next time we saw her, she was bringing the checks.

I may not have cared so much if I wasn't on a lunch break, but when it's business lunch hour, you'd think the waitstaff would try to acknowledge that. $20 for lunch with slow service and average food is never worth it.

Honestly don't think I'll be returning unless it's for cheesecake to go, which seems to be the only considerate service in the place."}
{"text":"Service was poor. Not friendly. Ordered spaghetti with meatballs, food was cold, meatballs had a hard crust, could hardly cut them. Threw the meal away. No management checked on our table. Have been eating here weekly for several years with a friend. Something changed negatively several months ago. Time to find a new place."}
{"text":"We waited almost 45 mins for food to come out and they brought the wrong order ! 
Never come back to this place . He waitress should have repeated what we ordered the first place very inexperience staffs !"}
{"text":"I came here once for Cheesecake, and the wait times were too long. There was no place to sit, it was overly crowded, and the Cheesecake wasn't that great. 

I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This location rocks! There was no line,  we simply walked right in and were seated right away. Our waitress was personable, attentive & funny.  Food came out shortly after we ordered.  Restaurant was clean. Staff was friendly. A great dining experience overall."}
{"text":"First, the Service. Party of 11: Four adults and the rest under 21: Occasion:  B-day party. The wait time was to be an hour.  It was more like 35 minutes.  Polite front desk and friendly. Seating was prompt and without hassle. 

Our server - Sheena.  The epitome of exceptional customer service.  Sheena is the kind of employee that employers try to keep guarded from other employers trying to poach such employees. The kind of employee every business owner desires.  An employee that instills such a great experience on patrons/customers - that it keeps them coming back. 

Sheena greeted our party with professionalism, courtesy, all smiles, articulate, and just the right amount of chatter.  She came across as a seasoned server that knew the exact amount of exchange and pleasantries necessary to make everyone feel welcomed.  From taking our orders for drinks and appetizers on to the main entree and desert.  Our drinks were always topped off and our table cleared of used glasses, plates and empty bread baskets only to be replenished without delay. Not a single person had to request service.  Sheena was always one step ahead. 

Thinking of pepper?  Too late, Sheena is already asking.  Shredded cheese?  Too late - Sheena is already behind you with cheese shredder just waiting for your affirmation.  Question about the food?  Yup, Sheena is there with an articulate explanation of options/make-up of the entree. 

I remember trying to think of any additional request - but Sheena was there - one step ahead.  We were so lucky to have been served by this great person.  Such a delight to have as our server.  

She worked our table like a ballerina - with the most exquisite detail to service. From the youngest patron, a 7 year old to my mother - everyone spoke highly of Sheena's performance.  The food, our drinks, deserts, everything was better due to Sheena's service. 

The Food - Most started off with sot-drinks, while I enjoyed a Moscow Mule.  No copper mug but the Mule had a kick to it and not watered down.  For appetizers, we indulged in stuffed mushrooms, fried zucchini, calamari and artichoke?  The stuffed mushrooms were perfect and the fried zucchini was perfectly presented.  Just the right amount of crisp. 

The Entrees included Chicken Madeira, Four Cheese Pasta (a favorite at the table), Steak Diane Scampi Combo, Fettucini Alfredo, Chicken Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips, Chicken Littles, and an assortment of other salads.  The Chicken Littles was quite the opposite of little.  My poor niece, who probably weighs less than 60lbs got full by just looking at the mountain of food on her plate.  It was an inordinate amount - much more than the typical Cheesecake Factory portion.  The food was very good.  Of course, we enjoyed our meal more due to the great service provided by Sheena. 

For appetizers the selection was diverse - Snickers Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Cheesecake, 30th Anniversary Cheesecake (this is the one item I had second thoughts on - I should have ordered the Oreo Dream Cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary didn't have the sugar kick that accompanied the Oreo Cheesecake), Salted Caramel - probably one of the best choices for deserts, and the Birthday Sunday for the Birthday girl.  Served with black coffee to conclude this exceptional experience. 

Thank you Cheesecake Factory and above it all - Sheena - just wow!  Thank you so much!  Entire family appreciate and thank you for the exceptional service.  Truly a unique experience.  That 30% tip should have been at least 50%.  Well deserved. Thank you again. 

The Arroyo family."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorites! This location is usually pretty busy on the weekends, so be sure to get there a little early. Great service, large portions, & it's always fun to walk around Kierland before or after your meal."}
{"text":"I have never experienced the terrible, disgusting service I got from this location.  I ordered the thai lettuce wraps to go, and when I got home, found a bug squished between the lettuce.  When I called to complain and ask for a refund, I was told they had to stay in business, so they wouldn't be offering a refund, and that the manager didn't understand why I was upset, because I didn't actually eat the fly.  I would stay far far away from the Cheesecake Factory in Summerlin, especially if you care about having clean food to eat."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Good place for group people.
Food: A-OK, but bad, as you expect. But do not expect too much. It's big chain, right?
Service: Good. Servers are all well trained."}
{"text":"This was our go-to place when family came to town, good assortment of foods on the menu.  The last two times have been awful and as a group decision we won't return.  The Calamari was tasteless, without a doubt the worst I ever  ate.  The kids mac and cheese was gross, like white cream sauce, not cheesy at all.  You know it's bad when the kids say ewe, something is bad with this mom.  Flatbread hardly had anything on it. Manager did take food off the bill but that doesn't make a person want to return."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints unless you look at the friggin nutritional facts of everything. Holy carb count!!! I have to stay away for long periods of time and I miss them like an old lover but when I do go I must get the macaroni cheese balls - shut your dirty mouth good - the Louisiana Chicken Pasta is so tasty and huge so it lasts two days -aces. The salmon is great, the Steak Diane is yummy, the caeser salad is awesome and so garlicky you will taste it with every burp for days but it's worth it. The mini fried chicken sliders are adorable and a good little dinner. And the desserts are, of course, delicious and horrible for you. Not a cheap place but I wasn't expecting it to be. Oh, and it's dark and the menu is obnoxiously huge. It's like reading a novel inside Hollister. 
See ya."}
{"text":"As is my general MO... \"I'm only here for the cheesecake.\" Soooo I cant speak to the rest of the menu but for cheesecake, I got u boo. 

I was short on time but cheesecake cravings wait for nothing. Service from the hosts and cheesecake ladies was friendly and helpful and they made sure I was directed to where I was going, and served up the best, whipped creamiest cheesecakes up in there. 

I got right down to business so I didn't have a ton of time to take in the atmosphere but it was basically as expected for the chain. 

The cheesecake, however was even better than it is in the states - perhaps because I didn't have to drive so long to get it? Perhaps because I was able to bring an extra one home? Who knows. But when I shame-scarfed that first pillowy piece in my car (alone obv), it was like a damn religious experience. The one I shared at home was equally delicious, but shared. Lame. 

I will be back, stretchy pants on and up, to take advantage of the full menu. You'll recognize me as the one weeping by the cheesecake ladies."}
{"text":"So sue me. 4 stars. It was that good. I feel almost guilty in writing about how delicious the food was and how terrific and professional was the service. 

Seriously. John. At the bar. Best service. 

Over the holidays I received a $25 gift certificate and used it (!) I was just bowled-over at how great the food and service was. In case it matters: Steak Diane and a big fat Scotch whiskey. Steak was delicious and the \"real\" portion was generous. (scotch whiskey delicious, as always, McCallan in case you wanted to know. ). I know their reputation is for huge portions, but this steak was under $20, delicious and plenty of it. 

(My only suggestion is that the mashed potatoes were not creamy enough. They were good but they were not creamy enough. )

IMPRESSIVE!!!   4 STARS!!

The tab was reasonable, John at the bar was terrific!  

I never thought I'd say this but I'm going back and I'm probably going back a couple times."}
{"text":"We met up with my Mother-in-Law, as it was convenient. This was a first for me, as I have never been to The Cheesecake Factory. We were here at around 11am, and I had already decided on getting breakfast. Of course, on display as you walk in are all of their amazing looking cheesecakes. I was 'this' close to just saying 'forget the breakfast, bring on the cheesecake!!!'.

Our waiter was awesome, and very professional. He was not wearing a nametag, but he must be the tallest guy there. I ordered an Eggs Benedict with regular bacon, as I always do, and my husband go the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. What I loved about both of these is that the condiments were in small bowls on the plates, rather than dealing with messy ketchup bottles. The lettuce and tomato for the sandwich were off to the side, so they stayed nice and cold. Nice touch. My bacon was not super crispy, but overall the benedict was pretty good. 

We had no room for a cheesecake, but saw the monstrosity that the couple next to us got. It was enormous!!! But they finished it. Ha ha. Next time I think that I will come here just for a  piece of cheesecake. The problem will be deciding which one."}
{"text":"I used to think this was the best restaurant in the universe. Thankfully, my dining tastes have come a long way since college. The cheesecake is divine, the entrees decent, but this place in NO WAY is worth a 40-minute wait at 5:30 on a Saturday night. Not to mention, the service sucks and the clientele was, um ...

{"text":"I haven't been to a CF in several years and never in AZ. Last night, my BF and I went to the one in the Camelback Corridor and we were both pleasantly surprised. 

My memories of CFs from back East were tons of mediocre food and great desserts. This time, however, we had very nice appetizers--avocado eggroll, samosas, and beet and goat cheese salad. My main course, the spicy chicken salad, was tasty. 

The appetizer portions are generous, the main course not so overwhelming and the dessert? Too stuffed to eat it so we took it home to  have tonight! But how can it go wrong for dulce de leche cheesecake? 

I would go back except that I know I will be tempted to try other restaurants in the area particularly the ones that aren't corporate-owned and have more interesting menus. That said, the few items we tried from CF's menu were A-OK. I'll probably take my son there for brunch sometime."}
{"text":"Loses a star right off the bat due to no wifi. Bar guy took good care of me. Said it was because they like to promote family (he guessed).  If that's the case and we are shoving family values down our throats, why not clean up the menu a bit and only serve healthy well balanced meals? Oh, and while we're at it, let's make it a little more affordable for a family to eat here rather than 15 dollars a dish? Family values also shouldn't promote drinking so close the bar too; unless that's the kind of family you come from.  Anyway, can I have the wifi password now please so I can download your app, or possibly communicate with other without my data plan being charged.  The wifi keeps our annoying kids busy so we can eat in peace.  Way to go corporate suits.  Besides that, food is good. ;-)"}

So I told my server and he sent manager KYLE. This dude came 20 min later and just started giving explanation. All he had to say was 'sorry that it wasn't made right. Instead he wanted to argue that this is how it is. Nice place but food and service is poor on my experience. Will never go to see his location."}

{"text":"Cheese cake factory...The food portion here in Vegas is great.

Hostess, waiter and waitress are friendly.

I over heard my waitress... We have bigger portion for the tourist. Good job.

:(  my little brother took care of the bill ahead of time... 

This is a Chinese thing... We pay ahead of our relatives or leave our card with our host to avoid the battle who will pay the bill.

We spent $125 and little did we know that during the course of the dinner we were served a dish with curly hair... CURLY ones...

As soon as we saw the curly hair, we brought it to our host... The manager came and to make it right he gave us a free slice of cake. 

This is VEGAS!"}
{"text":"This location was an absolutely NO NO - a total disappointment.  The worst and most rude service I ever had at Cheesecake Factory.  I went with my mother and my daughter there for dinner.  I ordered my meal and coffee.  I asked for cream when my coffee arrived, and kept asking many times for it. At least 20 minutes later, still no cream.  My coffee was cold.  I checked with my server again.  He told me \"Just wait\".  The tables around us came after us were all served.  I was still waiting for my cream.  I then told my server to bring me a fresh cup of hot coffee when he brought the cream.  Another 10 minutes later, my cream was finally delivered without the hot coffee.  I asked him \"Where was my fresh coffee?\" He answered \"We had to brew it\".  I asked \"How long?\".  He ignored me by pretending not hearing.  Rather than wasting my time, I paid and left.  I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory, I live in Summerlin and always frequent that location.  When I shop at the Forum Shop, I go to that Cheesecake Factory, but never will I visit this location again."}
{"text":"I was in the same group with Mia n O who commented this. \"I've never waited for food for 2 hours.  I walked into CF at 6:30, sat down at 7:15, waited till 7:45 to give my order, and at 9 my food finally came out...one plate at a time, so while we wait for everyone to get their food to eat, we have cold food.  And what about the manager, we complained and he put his tail between his legs to check, but obviously not trained enough to come to us and apologize or offer anything to make the situation better. 
UNACCEPTABLE!  Sorry we won't be back!\" I think the worse part though was the lack of caring that your customers were displeased.  I understand things getting busy or overloaded,  but there was no concern after we mentioned something other than by or server who was trying to help and show empathy.  He was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"They have decent food but as for the cheesecake I'll have to stick with more or so the new York style. All the varieties are great and I'm a huge cheesecake fan but cheesecake factory cheesecakes are a bit under my taste. 


The menu is also a bit over board for me. Like 10plus pages is just a bit to much. So overwhelming. All high price as well. Good place but a bit much for a place no exactly labeled as high end restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, and will continue too if they keep up this excellent service. There are times when it's absurdly crowded and waiting for an hour for a table. 

I've probably had the Herb Crushed Filet of Salmon over a few dozen times. Consistently good, what can I say. 

Avocado Egg Rolls for your app is a sure thing, ask for the ranch to dip with, believe me, it will change your outlook. 

Staff most of the time are tentative, occasionally there are times when service is slow, but that's expected with high volume locations. 

Most definite recommendation. The menu is overwhelming, and I'll need to try more to get a better understanding overall, but so far everything has enough taste to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ah, so torn. I'm probably closer to a 3.5, but the insane calorie count convinced me to round down instead of up. While I enjoyed my meal, I don't know if I could again knowing how awful it was for me. 

While running errands on the westside my gent decided he wanted to try The Cheesecake Factory because he hadn't eaten and wanted, in his words, \"something heavy that will sit in [his] stomach for awhile.\" We made our way to the packed mall and were told it'd be a 50 minute wait. That's about what we expected so we took our pager and wandered the mall for a bit. 

Somehow we managed to avoid many of the service issues that many reviewers seem to be encountering, but our server is also one of the better ones I've had in awhile at any establishment - shouts to Brianna J. if anyone from CF reads this. Our food all arrived in a reasonable amount of time, we (mostly) got what we ordered, and we were out in about an hour. 

For a starter we had the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Meatballs. Not something I probably would have ordered myself, but I gave them a try and they were delicious. The bleu cheese dipping sauce was a bit ridiculous - the chunks of bleu cheese were so large that three of them took up the whole serving cup. I guess that's maybe better than undetectable amounts of cheese? 

Shortly before the meatballs arrived we were also given a bread basket - the bread was soft and warm and sadly taken away when a bus boy cleared our other plates. Our server brought us another basket, though, which we stuffed in our to-go boxes later. 

For entrees the BF got Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and I had the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club. I was bummed to find out that they don't offer the Navajo Chicken Sandwich but this was fairly close in ingredients minus the bread choice. I ordered it with cheddar instead of Swiss, and when it arrived our server asked me if it had the correct cheese. I poked around and couldn't see where it was in the monster sandwich and then we determined there was no cheese at all. Brianna was kind and apologetic and offered to take it back to the kitchen and I said that it wasn't a big deal - it's more that I don't like Swiss than that I wanted the cheddar. 

The sandwich itself was really, really good. Flavorful, perfectly toasted, fresh veggies, crispy bacon. It's a towering beast - it was about four inches in height and required a good deal of smushing to get a solid bite. No complaints, though - I made three meals of the sandwich with the fries that accompanied it and the bread. 

The unfortunate thing is that the sandwich comes in at 1400 calories. I don't know what they do to it - grilled chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado on bread shouldn't be that bad for you. There's a similar sandwich at Panera where the only major difference is that it's turkey instead of chicken that is 500 calories. Even if they used two full tablespoons of butter to grill the bread it wouldn't nearly triple the calorie count. If the fries were included that'd make slightly more sense, but they're listed separately on the nutrition chart so I kind of think not. Woof.

Both of us were stuffed so we opted out of ordering dessert (also...$8 for cheesecake that I imagine is mass-produced somewhere is a bit steep), but the selections in the case looked good. 

The food and service on our visit was good. The price and calorie count, not so much. We'll most likely be back at some point, but if we'd have had poor service I probably wouldn't feel the need to return."}
{"text":"My friends and I are locals and we came to celebrate a birthday, it was 10 of us and they told us that the wait will be for 30-45 minutes, we ended up waiting 1 hour and a half. Once we got seated we waited another hour to get the food. We weren't happy and called the manager and the manager clearly didn't give a s**t, didn't want to make a small gesture, or not even an apology! We all are very disappointed and on top of that he pretty much said that we were liars and that we only waited 5 minutes. Who waits 5 minutes at a restaurant on the strip? Haha. 
We won't be coming back, neither should you!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is about, I don't like it. Done! I don't want to waste anymore time with this place. 30 min in the first line, then another 60 min in the second line, then 10min waiting for service, then 30 min waiting for food to arrive then another 30 min waiting the ladies to decide what \"cheesecake\" to order. Sigh..... 

It's not worth it, it's just a cheesecake. I ordered a steak, I don't know why I did that. The first bite was good, then all I did was chew, chew and chew after that. Like beef jerky, at least jerky have lots of flavours! The only thing I found good was the penne pasta my wife ordered. 

I'll save my time and money and find something else to eat next time.

Tonight was our early valentines dinner, my boyfriend got the garlic pasta and I got the stuff chicken tortillas. 5/5 for the both of them!! At the end of our dinner we got a strawberry cheese cake (who doesn't get cheesecake here??) and a smoothie. Overall experience was pleasant, our food was good and the service was comfortably quick.

{"text":"Came here after work for happy hour, went on my own so sat at the bar. Their happy hour is from 4-6pm mon-fri. 

They gave me a regular menu so I had to specifically ask for a happy hour menu which I feel should be given automatically during happy hour along w the regular menu. Orrr at least ask if I'd like the happy hour menu. 

For happy hour some Drinks $5.95, some apps $5.95 and small plates range from $5.95-9 give or take. 

I got the JW Pink Lemonade. Which is my absolute absolute favorite drink. Soo delicious, perfect blend of sweet and tart. But the calories would make me sway away from it if I have never had it or if I'm watching my caloric intake, but it was a long day so I'm my head i said \"treat yo self\"

For food I got the sausage ricotta flatbread. It has sausage, ricotta, herbs, kale, and mozz(I believe). Tastes good, smaller than I hoped but it was good. 

Service was alright. They asked if I wanted bread, said yes but they forgot. Prob didn't need the extra calories but I did want it. 

Also don't ask them for recommendations. They always say everything \"is good just depends what you like\". Feel like they aren't honest. Just saying that whatever you ask about tastes good. Would like an honest opinions but guess that's their job."}
{"text":"I was getting really tired of the overpriced ho hum food in vegas, everything tries to be fancy and special but I knew that I could come home to the SF bay area and pay half as much for something better.

But the Cheesecake factory was a very good deal for Vegas food. It's just as good as the others I have been to and the prices are very fair, especially for lunch. If it was closer to where we were staying at I would have ate there everyday."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of chicken wings, I ordered their chicken wings. Nothing impressive, but it was still pretty good. Cashier was not friendly- at all. I ordered the meal and turns out she gave it to me in a to-go box. We did not discuss that choice.  Besides that, the place is clean, in a good area, and has a fancy look.

P.s raspberry lemonade was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was forced to come here as needed to use the Loo and I felt super guilty afterwards so went to the bar and got a coffee for $4!! Honestly, at times like this, I recall with much fondness the EU system, where I pay my 50 cents but don't end up having to get things I really didn't want in the first place.

But I'm digressing - so I must say this Cheesecake Factory is gorgeously decorated and walks very spacious. Also due to the the French widows, the interior is flooded with light. 

My experience at the bar getting the coffee was eh. They were super busy and I was obviously a lower cost ticket than others siting at the bar. Also the coffee description in the menu did not live up to its hype - I wasn't a massive fan of the coffee beans used so will definitely not be getting it again.

{"text":"You know what you're going to get at a Cheesecake Factory - large portions and tasty food - and you know what you're going to get on the Strip - sorted like cattle, overcharged, and rushed. At this location, we got all of the first and none of the second.

They handle the crowds rather brilliantly - they take your name and tell you what time to come back, and when you return, you're swept directly to a table. It lessens the cattle-chute feeling when you get to just step up, step away, then return to be seated. We had a brilliant, wonderful waiter who nonetheless neglected to warn us we'd ordered too much food, but laughed along with us when we were defeated by the portion size. He was delightful and friendly, like everyone else we spoke to there, despite the weirdness of individuals in crowds (if you have 17 adults and five children, you need to ask for a table for 22, not a table for 17 ya weirdo).

Prices were higher than a non-strip Cheesecake Factory, but not offensively so."}
{"text":"If I'm being honest, the experience was a let down. I'm glad we didn't have to go through a long wait considering we went during a weekday morning, if you have to wait for more than an hour just eat somewhere else honestly.

The taste of the food was meh, pretty average. The portions, however, were great for the price. Normally I find that at similar restaurants such as Jack Astors, you'll pay $20 for a plate of paste and take 5 bites and it'll be done. At the cheesecake factory you're definitely getting a good amount, especially with the pastas (a lot more meat than pasta though). We also ordered burgers, which were good but nothing special.

The biggest disappointment was the cheesecake. I really enjoyed the variety that they offered, I mean you probably can't find half of these flavours anywhere else. But they were a let down. For $10 a slice I was hoping to be satisfied considering cheesecake is one of my favourite desserts. There was no cheesecake flavour at all from what I noticed. We ordered Oreo and Carrot cake, more than enough to share between 4 people, and you couldn't taste the actual cheesecake. It was more filling than cheesecake and to me at that point I could have just separately ate an oreo and bought a slice of actual carrot cake."}
{"text":"Usually love this place, today just meh... calamari is from a different vendor and nothing special, my fried mac and cheese is burnt and my service is mediocre... makes me sad!"}
{"text":"Yum! Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! Besides having the best cheesecake in the planet they also have an amazing happy hour. We tried the sweet corn tamales (my favorite thing), pork belly sliders, and crab and artichoke dip. Everything was SO good and HUGE portions for super cheap happy hour deals. I also had a spiked lemonade cocktail. It was clean, good service, and no wait which was great considering how busy they were."}
{"text":"Service was way below expectation. After taking our order, our waitress just disappeared. No refill on my water & my friend's water, we had empty glass for at least 15 mins. No one came and check on us. And finally she showed up to give us the bill without asking if it was one check or not. So we had to ask her to spilt the bill. Also she clearly didn't notice the empty glass so we had to ask for refill. 

Food was good, and of course the cheesecake was delicious. And that's the reason I didn't give it a zero or negative (if I can).

We were really unhappy and got a little bit angry later because after we were all finished, our waitress still didn't show up and we just sit there with nothing to do (nothing to drink because no one cared to notice the empty glass).

I like Cheesecake Factory even though lots of people claim it is overpriced. I appreciate good food and good service, but obviously this time, it didn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Get with the times people. Get an online check-in like the rest of the world or at least take a reservation folks!!! 75-90 min wait times make this location completely impossible while dining with kids or grandparents (neither can wait like that which is why someone invented the concept of on-line check-in and reservations decades ago!

TCF food is always great but the service at the location has never been above average if even that."}
{"text":"My husband and i are big fans of the Cheesecake Factory! We often cross the border just to eat at the restaurant in buffalo. We went to the Yorkdale location on a Sunday afternoon thinking it wouldn't be too busy during off hours. Staff was very attentive at the podium and asked if we needed a high chair (we waited about 45min to get a buzzer and another 2 hours to get a table.) The food was delicious and portion was generous. We ordered extra cheesecakes to bring home. There were trainers from the US who came to our table occasionally to make sure everything was okay. Our server was okay until near the end when we asked to pack the leftovers. We had 2 separate plates with food left, instead of bringing one plate on each hand, she stacked them on top of each other! How can she be so sure that the bottom of the plate is so clean that it is okay to put it on top of our food?! She also boxed all the food in one container! In the end, we didn't bring the packed food cause we didn't feel too safe about it. Overall, it was a good experience despite the wait line and the incident at the end of our meal. We will go again soon!"}
{"text":"5 stars for their White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake!

3 stars for the service and 3 stars for the food on a Friday lunch with no lunch rush. The service seemed to die down once we ordered our food and we had to wait a good 15 minutes after we finished eating to find the server to get us a box. (Maybe there was a lunch rush and I was not aware of it.) For an appetizer we ordered the Crispy Cheese Sticks. It was crispy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. This is definitely worth trying and getting for next time. I generally like the Cheesecake Factory and since I'm boring and set in my ways, I normally order the Bistro Shrimp Pasta or the Miso Salmon. I decided on the Miso Salmon, because they did not offer a lunch portion of the Bistro Shrimp. The salmon looked a lil overcooked with its blackened edges and as I took a bite, it was a lil dry. The flavor was not what I remembered, but maybe it's because I normally get it with the mashed potatoes instead of the white rice. Anyhow, I was disappointed with my lunch. My sister ordered the kids cheese pizza. It was probably about a 10incher and very cheesy. She said it was good, but had a funny taste. I think overall, I was disappointed with the quality of the entrees but maybe they just had an off day. I will definitely be returning for some yummy cheesecake though!"}

{"text":"I love cheese cake factory. And I keep going to this location because it's by my house. But for what ever reason they almost always screw up the entries. One time we ordered cheese cake and it was frozen. Yes it's not made fresh and shipped from California.  When I was back in Cali I ate and they got the order right and it was amazing. Tonight the chicken was terrible so over cooked it was like eating turkey jerky. Almost no sauce so we sent it back . Second time it was worse so we ordered something different. Came out great but the mashed potatoes ice cold not warm at all. This is a sign of a major problem in my opinion. Honestly I have eaten here at least two dozen times.  More than half the time the food is not right. Proof is the fact that they have only three stars. Guess I'm not the only one. Just wish they could be as good as the California locations.  I'll report back next time."}
{"text":"I was here last night to have a dinner with my friends as they were craving pasta. We were quoted a 15 minute wait, which was pretty accurate. After a short wait, we were taken to a nice booth seat, and our server came right away. We ordered some cocktails and th buffalo chicken as appetizers. Their cocktails are pretty big for their price and they tasted very good- we ordered blood orange margarita, blood orange mojito and pina colada. With our cocktails, the server brought us some warm breads with butter, which were good as well. 

The buffalo chicken was a deep fried dish of buffalo marinaded chicken chunks. However, there wasn't enough cheese or chicken inside the fried skin, so we had to end up just digging for the chicken to not get full from the fried part. As soon as we were done with our appetizers, our pastas were served. The portions were enourmous, like how cheesecake serves all their foods. 

Along with two bowtie pastas that my friends ordered which seemed fine, my shrimp scampi failed. The angel hair was dry when serves, there was no sauce, and it seemed like it was waiting for the kitchen line for awhile to be served. The shrimp was not sauteed as mentioned on their description but it was deep fried-and remember their appetizer was heavily fried as well. There was just not enough sauce for the whole dish to feel moist. The shrimps were so heavy that it did not go well with the angel hair. Also, their garlics were not sliced at all; but served in chunks. 

Their service was good, but if I were to go back again, I would stay with the skinny side of their menu, since they do not deep fry every ingredient."}
{"text":"Food was OK nothing special. The service was awful.  Host told us it was a 20 minute   wait.  We're still waiting to get a table an hour latter."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Forum Shops of Ceasar's palace, way in the back behind the Zeus moving statues (keep this in mind when sitting outside, the show is every hour on the hour and gets loud!).
We went to the Cheesecake Factory, having never been to one before. As it was in Caesars Palace, I was expecting inflated prices, however I was pleasantly surprised with the menu pricing.

The spinach, artichoke and cheese dip was great and the pizza and jerk chicken for main were both fresh and tasty. We took a slice of cheesecake to go (too full to eat after the starter and main) and it was lovely. The price level was decent, especially considering the quality of food you get. A good experience!
Our waiter was fast and friendly and offered advice on the huge menu (I mean it when I say there is something for everyone!!). 

My husband had the Meatballs, my sister had a pizza and I had a steak. All the meals were well prepared and very well presented. My steak was cooked as I like it, medium rare. Following the meal we chose deserts and again they were really nice, and surprising value.
The low light was the Fettucine Alfredo. Very little sauce, very little flavour. Very disappointing.

Both the meal and desert portions were large, perhaps a little too large for me and I have a great apatite.
The portion and value are great here and the food is very decent, though not so much on the healthy side (they do have a 'skinny menu' meant for those who are calorie conscious).

The service was excellent and our server was very conscientious, always making sure we had rinks topped up etc.

All in all, the title says it all. 'Good Food, Good Value - Great Evening'

We will definitely return to here."}
{"text":"Let me start with, do not plan on being seated in less than an hour to an hour and a half on a Saturday night at this location. My friends and I put our names on the waiting list around 7 and did not get seated until close to 9pm. We actually ended up getting a couple drinks at a bar close to the Cheesecake Factory and another at the Cheesecake Factory while we waited. I am definitely not complaining about this since it is typically this busy on Saturday nights in South Side.

The service, especially for how busy it was, was FANTASTIC! I wish I remembered our waitress' name, but she got us drinks (waters because, you know) and checked back multiple times for when we were ready to order. Typically you'd expect the service to be slow and hard to get when it's this busy, but we ordered and our food was out in probably 30 mins tops! I got the Chicken and Avacado Club Sandwich and it was deeeelicious! Everything was hot and crunchy - it was worth the wait! However, one of my friends ordered a cheesecake from the front counter before we left and that took almost 20 minutes or so to get, which I didn't really understand.

If you aren't in a rush, I'd say just stick out the wait because it is so worth it! They let you take the buzzers out of the restaurant, as long as you're in the restaurant 15-20 minutes before your buzzer should go off. It ended up being a nice dinner and I was definitely impressed with the service and food for how busy it was."}
{"text":"So a friend and myself stopped by the CF the day after Christmas for some preconsumerism consumption and were greeted by a friendly hostess, who seated us immediately.. It was pretty close to lunch time and they had ample seating for the lunch rush.  I recommend highly the avocado rolls for the appetizer!  OMgosh... Delisious-ness abound!!!  For the main meal I had a veggie sammich, which was great, great great!  Loaded with eggplant and mushrooms and other yum yums.  
It was plenty of food for the both of us with sandwiches and the app. for around 40 bucks, so it's moderate in the price scale.  I hear their namesakes desserts are good and do look well, but milk, and creams don't bode well with the ole system, if ya catch my drift!
One downer of the meal, was that the strip on my debit card is worn and the waiter had to manually type it, but when he came to the table he told me that it was declined, which was embarrassing, but then handed me the merchant copy to sign??!?!  I dunno what that was all about, but poor choice of words, waiter!"}
{"text":"Waiter lacked ability to serve properly very disappointed overall left with a second waiter so far not much better"}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory is always crazy busy and the noise level is over the top. I had the salmon which was excellent and my girlfriend had the chicken taco wraps which she loved and her hubby had the pulled pork sandwich which he said was good but my poor hubby had the macaroni and cheese hamburger which was not very good. The burger was so dry and the macaroni was not even edible! So disappointed!! We shared two pieces of cheesecake to go and the tab was like $100. Yikes!! Not worth it for not edible hamburger."}
{"text":"I've been a Cheesecake Factory fan since '98, it is a serious addiction.  I used to catch the #11 bus downtown transfer get on the trolley from EAST San Diego to Fashion Valley Mall that's how serious it WAS and IS!  B
So on to the review:

I really like this new location at the premium outlets, $6 for valet parking (so worth it).  Just like other CF locations there was a wait to be seated in the restaurant area BUT the bar area is open availability.  

The lunchtime options is more than enough food for a lunch portion.  I ordered SHEILA'S GRILLED CHICKEN & AVOCADO salad.  This lunch portion can be split in two, salad is tossed with a citrus honey vinaigrette.  Piled high are mixed greens, grilled chicken, cashews, shredded carrots, red onion, crunchy tortilla strips, cilantro and of course AVOCADO!  No need to search for the chicken, every stab of the fork you come up with piece of chicken.  Remember, this is ONLY the lunch portion, the dinner size might feed an entire table of 4, ijs.  The salad was DRESSED not soggy, still had crisp to the lettuce and crunch to the cashews.

for dessert:
SALTED CARAMEL CHEESECAKE
Um, yea...I kind of was disappointed with this selection, for me personally the graham cracker crust was too thick, the base was basic, what made it salted caramel was that a layer of caramel sits atop of the cheesecake.  Yea, that's all I have to say about that

Of course the cheesecake does not effect the star rating, I will just try a different cheesecake, they have over 20 different flavors.  But this is just my opinion , go try it out you might go giddy over the salted caramel cheesecake."}

My boyfriend and I just came for cheesecake, which was amazing per usual. We also asked for our leftover bread to go, but Jonathan L came in clutch and gave us AN entire loaf. We will definitely come back to this location. His service was also on point!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The Food was good, but the service and experience was horrible. They didn't have the beer I wanted, then they didn't have the entree I wanted and then they didn't have the cheesecake I wanted! No apologies from the server or a manager and no comp on the bill for our inconvenience. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm probably supposed to hate on the Cheesecake Factory due to its reputation as a soulless chain (a friend refers to it as the Dirtcake F*cktory), but I was honestly surprised at the quality and quantity of the food and liquor I got here. To be up-front, I did not pay for the meal -- my small independent company held our tiny holiday party there. The service was fast and attentive for a possibly annoying group of 15 or so -- I was absolutely shocked that they got everyone's different drink order right. As for the food, I got the whatever-the-hell-farm burger, topped with a fried egg and pork belly. Damn, it was great. I would definitely go here again if I had a group of random family members together in order to satisfy pretty much any appetite -- the menu here is the length of a novella. Oh yeah, and the titular (heh, I said \"tit\") cheesecake was pretty good too."}
{"text":"It's The Cheesecake Factory. Good food. Almost too many options. Great staff.  A tad overpriced. But the Penny factor is enough for me."}
{"text":"Cheesecake is hit or miss for me. The first few times I came here I wasn't impressed. Then I found the Chicken Madeira. This dish is amazing. Since then I've tried a few other dishes that have been hit or miss. For a home run every time, go for the Madeira."}
{"text":"Great food. The lunch portions are huge. If you want dessert, you may need to share an entree."}
{"text":"We were luckily able to get in within 2hrs (1.5 hrs wait to get a buzzer, then about 15 min to get seated). The food was amazing and big portions, the staff were super friendly, and the decor was nice. I don't recommend coming here if you're solely coming for cheesecake unless they have one that other places don't sell (most of the Coffee Culture cafes, sell the same Cheesecake Factory cakes for cheaper prices and no wait times). But where it stands out is the meals. I definitely recommend the porky belly sliders and orange chicken special. Yum! They will let you order your cheesecake for take out towards the middle of your meal so it's ready when you're done eating."}
{"text":"I am judging this from a HUGE CHAIN perspective, to be fair. The winner here at our meal was the fresh baked bread which seemed right out of Jersey City...the bread brought me back home. I have to think hard about the rest of our meal. I had the Asian chicken, kind of a brown sauce with lots of spice. It was okay. The salad was good. I can see why people like this place, it is large and can accommodate a million families and the dessert menu and case at the exit are quite alluring. I guess I would bring an older friend or parent here. I like better food...."}
{"text":"Had to try the first Canadian location after countless visits to the US. Both my fiancé and I agree that it did not disappoint. The portion size, interior design and menus are all the same. The prices are slightly higher which is to be expected since it is in Canadian dollar. 

We ordered the buffalo blasts as a starter and they were great. Fried chicken fillets stuffed with cheese and buffalo sauce with blue cheese and more buffalo sauce on the side for dipping. For a starter, this came with 7 huge pieces, good for sharing in larger groups rather than just us 2. For the mains, I ordered the louisiana chicken pasta while the fiancé had their daily special which was a Thai glazed salmon. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the crispy Louisiana chicken complemented it well. The salmon tasted very fresh and was not overcooked. To finish off our meal, we ordered the strawberry shortcake which consists of 2 shortcakes cut in half, with ice cream in the middle, surrounded by a mound of fresh strawberries, a must try. We also had a few cheesecake slices for take out. 

My only gripe however is the lineup to get in. Had to wait about an hour for a buzzer and came back an hour after we were given one to be seated. Granted, it was only their second week of operation so I'll give them a bit of a reprieve. For those who do not want to wait that long, they have a take out counter as well outside of the restaurant. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dessert. We were seated immediately. The hostess was friendly and made a couple of recommendations. The waitress came took our order and came back within minutes with our drinks. We each ordered something different. After getting our dessert orders we realize we could have spilt the massive portions.  My husband ordered a brownie and I ordered a piece of great hair silk pie. They were fresh and delicious. The were so big we couldn't eat it all. Prices were about $8.00 Each. I expected that with it being Vegas. It was a great atmosphere with great service and amazing desserts."}
{"text":"Went for dessert after dinner.  2 hour wait.  Put our  name in, was told to come back in an hour for a pager.  Wandered the mall, returned for pager, waited about 45 min. for a table,  

Friendly staff.  We were told that we could order at the to-go counter and eat outside on the patio.  We wanted to experience the restaurant.

Loved the atmosphere!  Very relaxing.  Excellent service.  Wonderful dessert and coffee.  Had the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake.  Hubby had Chocolate Mousse Cheese Cake.  Only had a few crumbs left.

Had eated dinner at Maggiano's...feel of the resturant was totally different.  Both had 2 hour waits, both were extremely crowded.  BUT Cheesecake Factory had a much more relaxed atmosphere.  Wait staff was not stressing out...calm, joking with each other, etc.  Lovely experience.

Wish they took reservations."}
{"text":"I am sure that this is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory as far as things go.  Maybe I'm not a fan of this location or maybe I'm not a fan of this chain period, but my last few experiences here have left me disappointed.

One positive thing I can say is that they have an extensive menu.  In general, you would be hard-pressed not to find something you are in the mood to eat.  

However, I've gone in there before and nothing has sounded appetizing - maybe it's just too many selections.  I can say that they have decent (but pricey) salads and I had good fish and chips from there.  I went there with a party and my boss ordered the barbecue salmon, which was WAY too salty for her. This was a day we were out to celebrate a co-worker leaving and had a party of four.  We waited almost 20 minutes to get seated, and then another 20 minutes almost before we could order.  By the time our food had arrived, we had been there over an hour.  This was lunch time, which was frustrating.  Our lunch there lasted over an hour and a half by the time we got dessert.

As far as their cheesecake goes, this has been the biggest disappointment.  It used to be you paid $8 and got huge pieces which were big enough for two to share.  However, my piece last time was about half the size it had been before.  It looks like they are trying to scale back on the sizes.  And when I thought about it, I got one of the specialty cheesecakes and so only about a third of it was actual cheesecake, and the rest of it had toppings woven in.  Not on TOP, as you would expect, but cutting into the piece of cheesecake itself.  The cheesecake part was not as good as it should have been for the price.

This location is swanky and nice, but every time I've been the service was very slow.  And since getting dessert and a lunch special was over $20 at lunch time, it seems a little too pricey for the quality of food and service you get there.  For me, \"meh\" just kind of describes how I feel about this Cheesecake Factory location."}
{"text":"This unit of a national chain has been in Madison for a couple years now and still hasn't gotten its act together.  The food is usually good but very inconsistent. Order the same thing twice and it is hit or miss if it will be prepared properly.   

My biggest irritation however, is their total inability to handle carry out/ car delivery orders. 

Supposedly you call in your order, let them know when you arrive and they bring the food to your car.   Sounds simple right?   I have used this service seven times and it never goes right.  Tonight I called and after 20 or so rings someone picked up but didn't know how to take an order.  Waited on hold and finally ordered the food although the person had no clue how to use CakePay, their Apple Pay system.  

After calling twice upon arrival I gave up and went inside.  The order was sitting on the bakery counter getting cold for at least 15 minutes.  

This time I asked for a manager and found the manager was the person that handed me the food.  He agreed they needed to get better at this and said to talk to the manager next time I order and they will make sure it is handled right.  That statement alone should say something about management.  

My recommendation is don't go on a busy night, and NEVER use their take out service.  Go inside where a member of the wait staff can take care of you.  

Oh, the cheesecakes are always very good!!"}
{"text":"Very Good service and food !! The food was cooked to perfection! I felt good being here! Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Always taste so good.  Please put more in the Pittsburgh area preferably Greensburg :)"}
{"text":"Only came here for appetizer for snacking but it became a full late lunch! Ah I was full. The service is great and not really busy here during the time we came. We ordered:

1) Calamari was well deep fried and cooked but no real flavor by itself or with sauce.
2) Ahi tartare was very small and only for one person. Had a lot of avocado, more then ahi tuna and the sauce was just right with the wonton chips.
3) Buffalo wings were good and well deep fried with ranch.
4) Fried Zucchini was good and well cooked. Love their ranch as it seemed homemade.
5) Loaded potato tots were good and filled with bacon,cheese,potatoes,etc but you can only have so much. I could not eat too much of this as it almost made me sick.
6) Plain cheese cake with warm chocolate sauce is always my fave!

My rating is more a 3.5 stars but had to round up. I would come back but we need to watch what we order! ;-)"}
{"text":"About 2 weeks ago 8 of us came here at 11am for brunch. Usually at other restaurants will charge you the gratuity automaticly for party of 6 or more but this cheesecake factory didn't charge.
Great service & good food. Everybody were really nice there, the host (RYAN & VADA), our server ( I forgot his name roberto or ricardo)
They have a lot of food selections & specialty under 500 calories also a lot of cheesecake to choose from  Their lunch special from 11am-5pm.

Each of us order different food. Maybe you think a little bit pricey but you get a lot of food. We were not even eat half of our food, too much food so We all have left over to take it with us . We all love with our ordered
We had a strawberry cheesecake (their original cheesecake top with a big piece of strawberry & a little bit strawberry sauce) & fries to share. Their fries is what  fries should be, I wish other places that sell fries do what like this place do. It is hard to explain but We love it

I ordered chicken bellagio $16.59 - 2 pcs crispy coated chicken breast over basil pasta & parmesan cream sauce top with prosciutto & urugula salad. REALLY REALLY GOOD I also ordered a slice of chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake to go but I prefer their original.

We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Finally got to check out Cheesecake Factory this past weekend. Before heading in we were betting just how long the wait time would be - my guess was he highest at 1.5 hours but it ended up being more like 3. 
The line in the middle of the mall is simply a line to get to the host stand and have your name placed on the wait list. At that point you are handed a buzzer and approximate wait time. The buzzer range is as far as Sportinglife and Forever 21, but we were given a 2.5 hour wait time so we figured we had at least 2 hours to kill outside of the buzzer range. Window shopping around the mall certainly made time go by a lot faster. 
Once inside we were excited to flip through the menu which is pretty wild. It has everything from pasta, pizza, tacos, burritos, meatloaf and so much more. Both of us ended up going for the pasta and neither of us were disappointed. 
Towards the end of the meal our server let us know that it was about a 20+ min wait for cheesecake orders and suggested we did that soon. We ordered the classic with strawberries. My one problem with The Cheesecake Factory is that well over half of their cheesecakes aren't real cheesecake. The majority of them are cake with a layer of cheesecake in between. There is also an odd consistency to their cheesecake. It's not as firm as any other cheesecake I've had before. The slice we split was good, but if you're a big fan of cheesecake such as myself it's a little disappointing overall."}
{"text":"We've eaten at other Cheesecake Factory s. Including this one. I've never experienced a messed up experience as tonight.  Waited over an hour for a pork chop dinner. Waitress was really struggling. It seemed like all her tables were having problems.  Her attention span was very limited.  They need to retrain her.  It looks like she got the cooks mad at her"}
{"text":"You have to try the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's unbelievable! The service is ok. The food is hit or miss.  Really only go back repeatedly for he cheesecake!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW! The Cheesecake Factory had a smile on my face & had me sayin' \"Oh yeah babe, BAM & Uhh Huh\", until 10pm last night! Hahaha. We had FABULOUS FUN! We got the new Specialty#Chicken Riesling which was an explosion of flavor in every bite! It's chicken with bacon, mushrooms, onions, garlic in a thick white wine Riesling sauce served with buttered Parmesan pasta! The BOMB!#A new fav! The chicken was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it! Everything complimented each other so well! It was a huge portion for only $13.95! I hope they keep this item on the menu because I'll get it again & again! 

The Cuban rolls are always a hit!#Full of flavor as usual#the perfect appetizer! The complimentary warm bread & butter is always de-lish! Loved the classic flavorful strawberry lemonade! For dessert I tried the new Celebration cheesecake which has layers of chocolate, strawberry & vanilla cheesecake, regular cake topped with fun-fetti  cream cheese frosting! It was delicious! Loved the Neapolitan theme!

Our server Amanda O. Was great! Even though it was a packed house, she was ON IT showing excellent customer service! She was constantly refilling our drinks, she was very attentive to all of our needs, and she was very sweet & friendly! If I could request a server the next time we go, I would request her in a heartbeat! We will definitely be back! The Cheesecake Factory ROCKS! :)"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is a favorite of my sons. The appetizers are nicely portioned. My most recent visit I opted for the chicken enchilada nachos. They nachos were crisp and warm, topped with a generous mound of cheese and chicken and drizzled nicely with semi spicy enchilada sauce. They'retopped with pico, sour cream, and guacamole. We also choose the Parmesan Garlic Cheese bread. The bread was served warm with lots of gooey cheese in the middle on the side was a small bowl of garlic oil dipping sauce. 
For our entrees we choose grilled Salmon and Spicy Louisiana chicken pasta. The salmon was grilled to a flaky perfection. It was served with mash and fresh veggies.  The pasta was almost al dente, which is not to me liking, but it was spiced and sauced just the way I prefer. 
We couldn't leave without a slice of its namesake. We ordered the Oreo cheesecake. It was enough to share with a party of 3 and light, creamy, with the the right amount of cookie flavor."}
{"text":"The food was good but not enough to overcome the painfully slow service. It took an hour and forty-five minutes at the table to finish the meal. The server spent time chatting with other servers while we waited for the check. The manager did not apologize when we brought this to his attention."}
{"text":"This is very good restaurant, went there couple of days ago with my wife and we had an excellent dinner , service was slow somehow but otherwise the service everything was good , I ordered Cajun Jambalaya and my wife ordered honey truffled chicken and both plates were delicious, also their portions are huge and much better than the other branch at Westlake. I will come back again"}
{"text":"The location was amazing and the restaurant looks great but the biggest problem that this place has is the wait time and the service by far. For me I was not impressed with the food as well. I had ordered a coffee and cheese cake slice and I only received the coffee. I will not be coming back at all. I was so disappointed with this restaurant/ bakery. Oh I should mention that I can receive my bill faster than I can receive my cheese cake."}
{"text":"My husband  and I came here on our first date, some years ago, but we went to the Summerlin location where there was an hour long wait, and ended up here. I got a salad and he got the thai noodle dish. We decided to go here again for date night during the week (now that he works days we can do things during the week, which is nice). We were able to get a table upstairs right away. Weekends are crazy busy-waits can be less painful by gazing at the very impressive aquarium featuring many different kinds of fish and some rays. This is a popular place among tourists so be prepared to wait. 

The service is very good (refilled drinks). We were presented with a bread basket (sourdough & honey oat) within minutes of being seated. Our drinks came right away. I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo (came with chunks of sausage and a large scoop of rice in the middle) while my husband ordered the shepherd's pie. The menu is about 19 pages long including 34 varieties of cheesecake! It was almost hard to choose something since there are so many choices. Most of the dishes are served on huge white plates (more like platters). It didn't seem too long for our dinners to arrive. The presentation was nice- parsley generously sprinkled around the entire perimeter of my plate. My husband thought that my dinner was small, but I only ate half of it, and took the rest home (as did he). The gumbo was good, but not traditional, in that the broth was clear, and secondly, there were big chunks of tomatoes. I thought that this is worth mentioning since I am a big fan of the traditional style gumbo with the roux (oyster bar at stations). The dish My husband's dinner was good and large (compared to mine), but I am not really a fan of this dish. 

For both our dinners, one drink, one water, it was about $35 plus tip. The ambiance (there is patio seating available), the service, the food, the wide variety of menu items, including cheesecake, the complimentary bread basket, and the location make this chain restaurant very attractive. (As busy as this one is, the one in Oahu seems to be the busiest CF location ever. This is the original location in Las Vegas; two others in Summerlin and Green Valley.) Also worth mentioning, the free show,  and the shopping is great- from the Gap, Bath & Body Works, the always-packed Apple store, and Victoria's Secret in the original part of the Forum Shops. Newly expanded stores include: Swatch, Tommy Bahama, Harry Winston, and Anthropologie. It might be confusing to some people how the different levels are, but just ask someone to point you in the right direction."}
{"text":"I was so excited about the expansion of the Premium Outlets/North, and was even more so, when I heard that this major restaurant was joining the newest shopping wing. Good timing, too. We had a couple gift cards to use. 

So, we came here on saturday for lunch, way before the crowd; since we got a tip from one of the ladies here to get in here before 12:15 pm as we were checking out the menu posted outside. 

We had the complimentary bread basket  with butter (french baguette slices and pumpernickel slices) and our little man had one too, which also included sliced bananas. I had a bunch of questions about the menu, since it'd been a while. I opted for the lunch size asian salad, while hubby had his favorite item, the cuban sandwich, and our little man had the mini corndogs and fries. It was delicious. I couldn't finish my salad, which was pretty big, even for the lunch size, but I'm glad I asked about the size of the salad. We also got dessert, once I mentioned the crazy one, hubby wanted that one. It was really good, too. I just was stuffed. (We had leftovers.) We still had a balance on one of the gift cards. They are treated as credit cards, so you still have to sign them. 

The service was excellent- our server was pretty attentive (drink refills, and checking on us from time to time). And the other servers were nice and smiling, as they passed us, too. It's refreshing to see people in customer service who want to be there, who enjoy their jobs.   

Inside, the decor (barqoue/neo-classical- elegant), was very in line with their other restaurants (been to Forum/Summerlin/Green Valley). We had to switch seats (booth & tables seating is available) as the TV had hubby's game that he was DVR'ing. Our stoller was stored with the rest, elsewhere. The lady gave us a claim ticket. 

Bathrooms were near the entrance. There were mens, womens, and a family one. I went into the womens and there were two stalls, one was handicapped. I went into the smaller one so I don't know if there was a baby changing station in the handicapped stall. 

The food court at this Premium Outlets is really lacking (Ok, who am I kidding, it sucks!), so this restaurant is going to be very busy and popular (the huge menu and the huge selection of cheesecake flavors). Hubby mentioned that this could be one of our special occasion restaurants. Our first date was at the one at Forum Shops (back in 2004). So, yes, we will be back. It's a yummy place."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory and I was pleasantly surprised. I had this idea that I it was a burger joint, but I was wrong.  I had creamy chicken pasta with sun dried  tomatoes. It was good, but too heavy of a meal for me.   The Oreo cheesecake was wonderful! I don't typically get near cheesecake, but it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Doesn't seem like any other THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Service is very bad. Unlike other cheesecake factories they don't serve the bread initially. That was surprising.! The standards are too low. Hope the franchisee takes a note about it.!"}
{"text":"If I were only reviewing the cheesecake it'd be 5 stars, no hesitation. 

Sadly this buisness serves more than just cheesecake. Way too much more. I love having a variety of choices. I hate having to read a novella just to see what my options are. It's pretty obvious that they've spread themselves too thin menu-wise. The food isn't awful but it isn't good either (especially considering the prices). The wait always seems to be forever for seating. Then you have another forever wait for the food.

Save yourself the trouble, eat your main course elsewhere. Come here for dessert, the drinks aren't bad so indulge with the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I really appreciate cheesecake factory for what it is...they've got a broad menu, and despite how broad it is, the food tastes good. I've had my fair share of items over the years, and there's always something for someone. What keeps me coming back are the BUFFALO BLASTS. 

I've since tried a couple items I've never had, such as the loaded tater tots. Not the typical tater tots, and they were good!

My fave part about cheesecake factory is, no matter which location, the food is consistent. It tastes the same EVERY TIME i've gone. 

And who doesn't love free bread. I love the brown bread."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour spot. Going to the Cheesecake Factory for happy hour is a real weekday treat. From 4 to 6 Monday through Friday you can enjoy drinks and appetizers for $5 each or so. I like the Mojito and the Cosmo too. My husband has had the pink lemonade drink and enjoys that a lot. The real draw here is the food. You can order many of their appetizers which usually run $10-$13 for around $5. The best part is the happy hour burger that my husband always orders. Unlike most places that only have sliders this is a full size burger and fries can be ordered with it for a dollar or two more. He loves it as he can have an adult beverage and a burger and fries for like $12. I enjoy several of the appetizers especially the shrimp spring rolls and the avocado egg rolls. There are other things on the menu I am tempted to try but I keep going back to my favorites. I have dined at the Cheesecake Factory outside of happy hour and it's still really good but happy hour is the way to do it!"}
{"text":"I typically love happy hour at the Cheesecake Factory and have had great experiences in Chandler and Biltmore. But the horrible surly service from our waitress ruined this location for us. Husband ordered a burger and clearly asked for it with just the cheese. It came out with sauce and onions and he politely informed the waitress. She did not hide how annoyed she was and pouted as she took it back to the kitchen. It came out a few minutes later, still with onions! He found her again and politely informed her there were still onions on the burger. She was so annoyed and tried to argue that there were no onions although he tasted them. I said he asked for his burger plain so could we please have a plain burger. Her response to me was, in a condescending rude tone, \"I heard you.\" That is not how you treat customers. I have worked in customer service for 8 years and I have never said that to a customer. This waitress should be fired. The manager apologized and gave us a free drink but it did not make up for how awkward the dining experience was. We will not return to this location. It is a disgrace to the Kierland Commons area which is a nice area full of high end dining options. Wait staff should be on their A game."}
{"text":"This restaurant is average. Decorations are good, quality of food is correct. But is so cold inside !!! My   meal wasn't the same than my order and the server didn't let us finish our plates ... my friend wanted to eat a cheesecake inside restaurant that the server gives her a bag with the cheesecake inside... we really felt oppressed ! Others places of this franchise are better."}
{"text":"Good restaurant ! Clean and employees very professional.
Just I would taste the whipped cream with my dessert but I think she has forgotten lol"}
{"text":"I usually love this place. But last night after taking 2 bites of my herb crusted salmon I knew something wasn't right. I figured maybe it's just me, brought it home for later. Went to bed & woke up at 230am with projectile vomiting. Something was not right with the fish. After throwing up all day and being hooked to an iv along with a lot of sleep the nausea and vomiting has finally stopped. Sadly I will not be able to go back to this place."}
{"text":"Awesome service, food and prices! That's all you need."}
{"text":"OVERRATED!!!  Food was average.  Service was horrible!!!  It took 45 minutes to get our food and waited 20 minutes for our waiter to come back to take our dessert order.  By time he came back the kids were too tired and didn't even want to stay.  It shouldn't take 2 hours for dinner.  Plus, the kids were charged for drinks which should have been included in the kids meal.  Asked the manager to correct the issue and was charged twice.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"Went out on a date with my husband.....rare get away from our baby lol. I ordered a baja chicken taco. My husband ordered Thai lettuce wrap. His was delicious!!! My meal lacked flavor and the taco broke as soon as I picked up each one. Very hard to eat. I would not recommend this.....I have rated this so high because they really do have amazing menu items and are very yummy. Pasta, salmon wraps, steak...especially cheesecake. Just wanted to help save most people from a disappointment."}
{"text":"I had a small Fresh vegetable Salad it came with asparagus, green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, roasted beets, apples, Edaname, radicchio, romaine all chopped with vinaigrette. (So good it was lite nice for a Summer day)
Herb crusted filet of salmon came with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  
It Was A Lot Of Food! I only ate half of my salad and a couple bites of my meal. Our server was really nice I can not have any dairy and my salad came out with cheese once I let him know he corrected it and had another out within 5 minutes with managements apology."}
{"text":"I'm so disappoint not only in the quality of the food but the service.  My daughter chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner and it was terrible from getting or drinks to the meal.  Two of my kids fell asleep at the table because we were waiting so long.  The manager came over and said desserts on him.  So before we left we got three cheesecakes to go and we went to go pay our bill and they included the cheesecakes on the bill.  Went to the front and talked with a different manager and explained the cheesecake was on the bill, he said this is the first I've heard of this but he would take it off.  What a horrible place that my daughter had to celebrate her 13 birthday!  Cheesecake Factory is definitely off our list!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. A bit overdone because they are everywhere but consistent.  Wait tone seems to be long but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience yesterday. I've been to Cheesecake Factory many many times and always left satisfied and happy to go back. Our waiter was just ok. First initial meeting he just seemed like he was bothered. When we originally were to be seated we would have been seated in a different section, however we asked for a booth and was seated in his section. Now I don't know if he knew that and that had anything to do with it or what. The food seemed off. You could tell someone different was cooking because I had just been there a week prior and ordered the same thing. The bread on my sandwich was hard and had no flavor (Chicken salad sandwich), my salad was soggy underneath a crisp bed of greens, and my daughters fries were way over cooked. At the end, our waiter packaged up our food. We were going to package up our bread that he had dropped off earlier and didn't get a chance to touch, but was waiting to get back our containers to put it in the bag. As soon as he came back he dropped off the bags and check and reached over me as I was about to grab the bread and took the basket and walked away. My husband and I looked at each other pretty stunned. He watched him grab our bread basket and hand it to another table. First off I'm pretty sure you should not be giving hand me down bread to someone that was just seated. How do they know I haven't touched that? I'm just getting over a cold, what if I had? Completely gross. Also I know it's not required for them to ask if we wanted drinks to go but 75% of the time they do and it's an added bonus that I will definitely tip for. He didn't care. Just wanted us gone. Of course will plan to go back but will definitely ask to move if he is our waiter again."}
{"text":"The wait was very long but our server Stefan was amazing! He was very accommodating and friendly. The food was good. I ordered the Da Vinci Pasta. My past tasted like it was a little bit under cooked but the chicken was really good!"}
{"text":"Usually I'm a fan. 
BUT... I was there over the weekend and everything was kind of wrong for me: the salad I ordered was bitter, I asked for extra beets and they gave me none, and my friend's salad was really just OK too. I've visited The Cheesecake Factory dozens of times before, but this specific experience was just really just not that great."}
{"text":"This was my first time in many years to eat a meal here and it was ok but no wow factor. First bread brought to table cold, had to ask for hot bread. My burger was very good but wife's chicken parm was not hot and lacked flavor. The only reason this place gets three stars is because the cheesecake is still excellent. Do yourself a favor and skip the meal and stop by for dessert."}
{"text":"You know we love to come to cheese cake factory ! But tonight was just not on par to what we are used to getting ! 
Guess tonight was rookie night and no one told us ! Lol 

Service was okay .... slow ... and seemed frantic ! 

The food was not up to standard either ! 
I hope this was just an off night ! 

And bit of signs to come ! 


Payment took forever as well as the time to get our cheesecake to go !


It might be a while before we come back ... kinda sad !"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dessert and they opted for dinner. My husband and I got our dessert within 5 minutes of ordering. Our friends waited 15 minutes or so for food but had bread to munch on. We had 2 servers while there, as the one initially serving us got off and switched shifts with our next server. Both were good. Our glasses stayed full of water and we were even offered more bread while we waited. Our desserts were good - it is Cheesecake Factory after all!"}
{"text":"Every thing was delicious. Only problem is my salmon had a few thin bones in it  and the wait a a little ridiculous. I will come back."}
{"text":"A huge thank you to Jamie for accommodating my large party. I love his personality and he is an asset to your establishment. Also my server Courtney was wonderful, PATIENT, and constantly kept our glasses full.
The food was as expected (tasteful, large portions and fresh.) Our only problem was a salad containing beets and asparagus arrived without those items. The cooking staff should have informed the patron or the server of the issue. A manager did address it once the mistake was realized and informed us that they were out of beets.
As for the other meals, the food was hot and fresh. Well seasoned and the chicken is never dry. Their meatloaf is double the average serving you would receive in other places.  Most people will have enough for a box to go. Good food, good service."}
{"text":"I enjoy a great experience at a chain restaurant now and then and I have never been disappointed with my experience at this Cheesecake Factory. The managers obviously take great steps to hire a friendly staff. Our waitress, Kim C., was so wonderful with us and really made our experience enjoyable. 

I know I can always rely on quality food from the CF. The menu is very large and can be daunting if you don't know what you're in the mood for. I had a glass of red sangria and it was so delicious, the best part were the soaked apples in the bottom. For an entree, I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps and they were fabulous like always. It's a very filling meal and enough to share or to make into two meals, leaving you with leftovers."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. The only conplaint is long wait time. Even on tuesday night there was a big rush..they dont reservations, its walk in"}
{"text":"Ronny and Phillip are excellent waiters. Very friendly. The food here is always consistent. No matter how busy it is this restaurant is able to get your food out hot, fresh, and fast. 

They always cook their steaks right the first time which I really appreciate. 

Highly recommend this location and restaurant if you are looking for large selection of dishes and cheesecakes"}
{"text":"I was lured in by the National Cheesecake Day deal of half price cheesecake.  How can you go wrong with a deal?
Service at the bar was okay but kinda slow because they had to get the salt for my Margarita and that took longer than it should've.  There were vacant seats at the bar and a couple took a pair of seats to my left and the gentleman waited until I got my drink so he wouldn't crowd me.  Another lady swooped in and was rude, bumping and crowding me unapologetically so she could have the vacant seat I opted to not be sitting in while I got my order.
I was very glad to get away from that scene.
The hostesses got us a table in just over five minutes and seated us promptly.  There was a lot of activity there on this particular day because everyone realized at the last minute that today was the last day for half price cheesecake.  
Our waitress was sweet and kinda adorable too with her positive approach, bringing me water without asking, and helping to select menu options for hubby and myself.  I couldn't decide on dinner and asked for her to give me a recommendation.  
I went with a salad, I think it was their version of an Asian salad but truly I just can't remember.  I had asked if there was a salad with strawberries and chicken and what she suggested is the one I had, but she got the kitchen to add strawberries so it was more to my liking.  Excellent.
And hubbies pasta was served up as he had requested too.  Very nice.
French fries that were supposed to be part of my sons meal were overlooked and didn't make it to the table until he was almost done with his sandwich.
And the manager actually stopped by to apologize for the French fry oversight too.
Here we were enjoying each others company and the food, discussing the day and such -not at all in a fuss about the overlooked FF, so it was a surprise to have him check in on us.
It seems the spicy chicken sandwich he ordered was not what he had hoped for because it didn't have enough spice to really qualify as \"spicy\", but otherwise he said it was good.
Now the cheesecakes, omg, there are so many options it's difficult to decide.
I went with my first impression and got the Mango and Key Lime.  Not being a fan of Key Lime pie I wasn't so thrilled with that part but thought the Mango might make the Key Lime a nice blend.  Eh, not the case.  I felt I was eating a Key Lime with Mango cheesecake.
Still good and after a couple bites with some coffee I decided I should have the rest packed up and it was time to go.

Prompt seating even through there was a huge crowd.
Really good service, but the times I've been here before I guess this is standard and to be expected.
Yummy meal that was ordered up with specific instructions and delivered as such."}
{"text":"Long wait for mediocre food and subpar service a huge menu and when the waitress takes your order they are out of what you want! I will never return to many choices in vegas"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service great, consistent just like All the other cheesecake factory.
Sweet brown bread was so good, pasta perfect! 
Love their blueberry & white chocolate cheesecake!"}
{"text":"The most disappointing meal I have ever had. Where do I even begin to complain about the disaster that was my niece's 18th birthday dinner. We went on a Tuesday evening at 5:30 because we had a large party of 10. We thought there would be no problem getting in and out of there in a reasonable amount of time. Arrived at 5:30 and left with cheesecake to go at 8:00 because we could not bear to spend another minute sitting there eating the cheesecake for dessert. 2.5 hours! RIDICULOUS!
It took a bit of time for the appetizers to come out, but it was not too bad. SHortly after the apps, my niece got her Turkey sandwich, but no other meals came. After waiting over an hour, my husband got up to complain to the manager who had no idea there was a back up in the kitchen. Shortly after he complained, the food started coming out....at all different times. It took about 10 minutes for 9 of us to get our dishes and the 10th followed about 10 minutes later. How does that even happen? How can you not serve all 10 at once? You are the damn Cheesecake Factory, not a Mom and Pop shop at the neighborhood corner. 
The waiter kept apologizing the whole meal, but that only goes so far. The Manager never came to the table. Terrible mistake on her part. She should have made an appearance with some type of explanation. Shame on her. Horrible customer service. 
In the end, the waiter took off 2 appetizers and one meal. We were not even offered complementary cheesecake!
This is one crappy memory to have as your 18th birthday dinner. I will tell every person I know about this experience and suggest NEVER going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the Ahi Salad and it was Delicious. Big fan! I also had the strawberry shortcake and it was also amazing. 

Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and they had a little \"outdoor'' patio area to eat on. Of course, since it was inside with the forum shops in Caesar's Palace, it was still inside. Good food!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this location with no stars, I totally would.. A million times. 
Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants I get excited to go to. So, finding out that they had opened a Cheesecake Factory near my job had me hyped up.

This location is by far has the worst service I have ever gotten in my life!! I usually just order pick up now a days since the servers abandon you and give you very poor service. Even the food sometimes makes me sick. I'm sorry, but I'm am very unsatisfied with this location."}
{"text":"Probably the best value resto @ Caesar's lol without breaking an arm and a leg.  Sure it's not dirt cheap, nor should it be for such a higher-end casual chain, but at least you're not paying $50 per entree @ Gordon Ramsay, but I digress.

The usual pricing and big portions.

Located at the way back from the Forum Shops, and liked what they did with their patio; it's massive enough to soak in all the eye candy that Vegas has to offer at this time of year.  Don't know possibly how one review said it's quiet in here."}
{"text":"You knoooooow. I wasn't blown away by the cheesecake. We literally just came in for cheesecake for my bestie's birthday. 

Our server subtly flirted with me, which was flattering. We got seated pretty fast, which was nice. 

Our cheesecakes were good, but it wasn't as amazing as I remember. We ordered the banana cream and a chocolate one. We took some home too. 4 cheesecakes and a drink cost me almost $50. Um, yeah no thanks you. Not exactly worth it."}
{"text":"Foods always good. Service BLOWS. I've yet to have a competent waiter. But the cheesecake is bomb, of course."}
{"text":"Service was very slow.   Waited 3 X as long as they said we would.   Seated outside where there wasn't enough light to read the menu.   The meals did not come out together. Delay on drink refills.  No one checked on us until we were done eating.  And food was ok, but not as good as expected.  My scampi was strange,  fried with a crust rather than sautéed and almost no garlic.   The angel hair was a sticky lump in the center of the plate without any sauce.   Took about 30 seconds to congeal."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a staple in my wife and I's dining out habits. However, the last time we went to dinner we had a really disappointing experience. We brought her family that were in town from Germany so that they could finally experience this Cheesecake Factory place we tell them about somewhat frequently.

To start, our waiter was the definition of a tool. I hate to be mean, but his name might as well have been Tony tough nuts. He tried to be nice, but the vibe from him just was not good. What's worse is he forgot drinks for 15 minutes at a time, and would remember when I asked about them. He took FOREVER to take our initial order, despite me asking and him walking past quite a few times. Just in general, bad vibe.

Then comes the food. Service is forgivable when the food is amazing. This time, it was not. We decided to get the Guacamole since we recently had some at El Dorado and we were craving some again. They brought it to the table, and we quickly realized that it was HUGE chunks of Avocado, and not ripe avocado at that. It was hard and stringy. So I asked the waiter to send it back since, ya know, we couldn't even dip chips in it because it was like half an avocado at a time.

He brings it back, and says...yeah just so you know that's how we do the guacamole now, so if you want it more mashed up you have to specify. REALLY?! It's a DIP, not pieces of apple you're eating. The thing is, with this guy, he could have been making it up since he was that type of person. he also tried to blame the bar on the drinks, then clearly went and put it in the computer since he forgot (we could see the bar and the computer right next to us).

Anyway, my four cheese pasta came out luke warm and cold on the outsides, but by this point I said screw it, I ate some of it and too the rest home to heat up the next day. 

Overall it was a bad experience, and I doubt we'll be back anytime soon. Gordon Biersch is always consistent for us, as is Brio, so we'll probably just go there."}
{"text":"Came here last month on the 26th a few hours before closing just supposing to grab a quick bite before we head in for the night and we were very glad we did! To start our server Clayton was Fantastic! A seasoned waiter who knew exactly when to stop in when we needed something, Great demeanor and Very friendly (sadly a quality missing among some wait staff in many establishments today). 
      The drinks were great! If you are a Bourbon fan make sure you try their Bourbon & Honey cocktail along with their Sausage and Ricotta flatbread (two of our favorites after many visits to the Cheesecake).
      Most menu items are a generous portion, always food leftover to take home or share. Enjoyable atmosphere and beautiful designs inside restaurant itself, good place for a night out or casual date night! Cheesecake Factory is definitely a higher end casual establishment in which you will not regret paying a visit!"}
{"text":"Thank you Jon S.  You recommended the perfect drink and helped me find a delicious menu item for my first visit. I appreciate the extensive knowledge about the menu that you were able to share. I didn't like my first choice and you encouraged me to try again. You are absolutely an asset to the company. 
Thank you again."}
{"text":"Really can't go wrong at just about any Cheesecake Factory but this one is exceptionally reliable. We frequent this location once or twice a month and almost always have perfect service and great food."}
{"text":"Ridiculously long wait for service when the restaurant was otherwise slow, and the food was barely passable.

Our waitress appeared disheveled, and she certainly wasn't very efficient. We waited more than one hour for our food, and the food is quite simple. The restaurant was also not very busy. We had a burrito, a salad, lettuce wrap tacos, and a cheese only omelette. Normally this would be served up in 25 to 35 minutes.

When the food get arrived, we pointed out to the waitress that one of the classes was horribly dirty, with a big brown ring around the inside of it. She wished it away, and laughed about it. Later, she returned again laughing, and said, don't worry about it, it was only a bad stain and not scum on the inside of the glass.

Overall, a great disappointment and we will definitely not be returning to this particular location. It was not at all up to the standards of what I have come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory, which isn't all that exciting anyway."}
{"text":"Im not sure why I came back so soon.  Very disappointing.  Asked they be sure the potatoes were hot because it took them 3 times the last time and no, they were not as hot as they should be.  Also told waitress we would be splitting food with the children to save room for desert.  Didn't see waitress for a while so we used the bread plates.  When I mentioned to waitress that it would have been nice to get extra plates for the kids she said I should have asked her... I thought that was a given.  She then sloughed  us off and went to the next table. I muttered under my breath that she wouldn't be getting as good a tip to teach grandchildren.  She somehow overheard and flippantly said she didn't care.  Wow!"}
{"text":"The granddaddy of big box food. Tasty? yes. Inventive? not really. Oil and butter as substitutes for inventive, creative food? Most likely.

Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable.

The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full \"skinnylicious\" menu to encourage, or at least offer, more healthy menu options. But at the end of the day, their menu seems to rely a bit to heavily on butter and oil as the primary constituents of flavor."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I am not necessarily a fan of the chain restaurant. Particularly in Las Vegas when there are so many other great choices of places to eat. That being said, I had my 3rd ever experience at any Cheesecake Factory recently as I was joining some of my wife's colleagues for a pre-show dinner before we were to go see Cher. The place was hopping, but looked very large.

My first impression of this location was great! The staff were very friendly, and despite not having a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend, our party of 8 was able to be seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Our waiter was excellent. Most of us were either CCF newbies or seldom diners and we were all full of questions about drinks or menu items. Our waiter was very patient, helpful and humorous. I had quite a few questions about the veggie friendly items, and he was very good at answering my questions.

As far as the food and drink. I was happy to find a couple microbrews on the menu, and I opted for the Hefe. The rest of our party enjoyed one of the many cocktails that the CCF offers. All of our drinks came out at the same time, and only after about 5 minutes after we ordered. I ordered the nachos minus the meat and edamame, and most of the table also ordered apps. The portion sizes on these apps was massive, and we probably could have only ordered 4 for the entire table. I was able to conquer about 1/2 the nachos and had significant help with the edamame. Our service was quick, which we needed since we had a show at 7:30pm. Our check came fast (but not too fast) and was worked out very quickly. 

Overall, it was a great experience. Our bill was actually very reasonable especially noting how much food we got. The service was great and the location perfect for what we needed. I probably won't be a CCF regular, but I will definitely be open to dining there again. My only concern was that gratuity was not added to our bill (even though we had 8 people) which was different than I am used to seeing. That could be a problem for people who don't look too closely at their bill."}
{"text":"The SkinnyLicious Menu was outstanding this evening and the service was
above and over the top !"}
{"text":"Can't ever really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. The portions are huge, food is pretty good, decent price for a restaurant, and the cheesecakes are amazing. Went here for a date night with my boyfriend one night. I never realized how huge this Cheesecake Factory is! Didn't expect it to be as big as it was. It's a little too dimly lit, in my opinion. We were seated near the kitchen area and given free bread. It was extremely cold in here...I wish I had brought a jacket. We knew the portions here are huge, so decided to share an appetizer of crispy crab wontons and one entree of the alfredo fettuccine with mushrooms and chicken. The crab wontons came out quickly. They were extremely hot and we burned our tongues on them. ): They tasted great though! The pasta came out soon after. The pasta was heavy and filled us up quickly. Even though we were sharing all of this, we almost didn't order dessert. ALMOST. How can you go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake?! We ended up ordering a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. It was delicious. Lots of gooey cookie dough pieces in the middle. We were only able to finish half of it because we were so full. The total was about $50, which isn't too bad for how full we were. This is probably one of the cheapest restaurants to eat at on the Strip."}
{"text":"Called in an order for a cheesecake for a birthday party and was told I could stop by the \"curbside to go\" and they would bring the cake out for me. I told them I would be there at 530 and they said they would have the cake ready for me at that time.  I called right before I arrived and I was told they will send somebody out immediately. 5 minutes later a customer arrives and within a minute, the attendant comes out and serves them. I immediately talk to that attendant and he says they will be right with me. Ten minutes pass and I give them a call again and they said they didn't know I was out there waiting. Fifteen minutes now and another customer pulls up behind me and is served. The waitress had no idea I was there again.

When I asked for the manager the manager came out and said there was nothing he would do to compensate me for my time. He said that it is my fault for not letting them know I was outside despite the fact that I called twice and talked to two attendants about having waited for someone to help.

I understand that mistakes happen in the service industry but to come out after 15 minutes of waiting and two different customers being served before me and have the manager tell me that I was at fault was not worth an overpriced 60 dollar cheesecake. On top of that, the cheesecake was still frozen an hour and half after I picked it up even though they told me they had left it to thaw two hours before I got there! I will never come here again and I don't recommend anybody else to go here either. Go somewhere local. At least your business will be appreciated."}
{"text":"First our waitress Tara was amazing she went above and beyond to accommodate my dad. We tried the crab and artichoke dip which was great but the grilled bread that comes with was beyond toasted so it was like eating it on croutons.  The mango pineapple avocado salad was light and filling. The Shepard pie had a rich mushroom gravy but it zucchini in it which was odd.  The lettuce wraps was a fun dinner selection"}
{"text":"Went here with my bf after the Halloweentown pumpkin patch since it was within walking distance. I really loved the ambience of this place, exterior and interior. We came on a Monday night and were seated right away although there were larger parties ahead of us. I got the spicy cashew chicken and my bf got the carne asada steak medallions. Both were very good, especially the first bite of my spicy cashew chicken. It had strong flavorings but wasn't as spicy as the name. My server knew so he brought out chili peppers for me, which kinda helped! It was good but got kind of salty after a while so I decided to take it home for lunch the next day. We also wanted dessert and since the place is called Cheesecake Factory we opted for a slice of regular cheesecake. It was pretty sweet but eating it with the whipped cream given definitely complemented the taste! Overall, I would come back and maybe try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! From food, service to the obvious... the desert.  I had the honey truffle chicken with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Extremely Flavourful and juicy! Went with a party of 9 people, every one loved their entrees.  For desert we enjoyed the birthday cheesecake and the original.  Menu had items for every time of appetite."}
{"text":"Wow. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. We went there tonight for the wife's birthday. First they run out of what 2 people ordered - telling us well after the order was placed (oh well not a huge deal) then they send out the two other meals (party of 4) and they were both stone cold. Sent the orders back. After a long wait they finally brough the replacements. One of the meals was completely undercooked (actually uncooked). To top things off one of our party has very strict dietary issues (which we made a point of letting them know when ordering) and cannot eat meat. His meal ended up having chicken in it!!!! How many strikes? 4!!!! Unreal. Waitress handled things correctly, unfortunately Management could not have been more cold and uncaring. They ended up not charging us but probably would not have done that if I hadn't said I wasn't paying. Amazingly bad. 

Very disappointing and poorly handled. I have only been there a few times but can assure that I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the cheesecake factory. Our server this evening was amazing and recommend a delish dish. She made us feel like we were her only customer"}
{"text":"I have been to many cheesecake factories but this one was very disappointing. The way the hostess keeps track of customers and the random order of being seated was rude. The only thing I liked was their new skinnylicious menu and our waiter. Recommend skipping this location."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but not worth the wait time and service takes very long. The cheesecake felt like it was bought in not made in house."}
{"text":"Overall: A poor service experience, but the Manager's response was thoughtful.

Service: 2 stars.  I called for a carryout order, which is when the issues started.  My name is Patrick but they somehow heard Christian.  I pulled up to their Order-to-Go parking space when the food was supposed to be ready, and called them to say I was there.   No one came to see me, and after 15-20 minutes, I walked inside to the carry-out counter.  Apparently their Order-to-Go and carry-out systems are separate, and the name was incorrect, so it took them another 15 minutes for them to find my order.  On the way home, I called the Manager (Bruce Peterson) to complain.  He was very nice and patient, and he even mailed me a gift certificate for my trouble.  That's a good example of making up for bad initial service.

Food: 3 stars.  It was cold after waiting for so long, but I heated it up at home and it was good.

Location: 3 stars.  It's nice to have it close to the Legacy shopping center, but the parking is not sufficient."}
{"text":"I ordered a chocolate truffle cake along with the chicken piccata with angel hair pasta. Companion companion bacon date wrapped pizza and tater tots. Tots where deep fried mashed potatoes, not the shredded or I just found tater tots did not like them as much. Companion like the richness of the bacon dates and cheese pizza, and we both enjoyed the chocolate truffle cake. Pros : a huge menu with many many items. Cons: no military fire police discount. Another con is the huge menu with many many items. It took more than several minutes to even there are down to two choices."}
{"text":"This place has the biggest menu ever! Too much to decide on. I love the stuffed mushrooms and most of the appetizer menu the most. I have never had a drink here but they look delicious too. And of course you have to have a piece of cheesecake."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite CheeseCake Factory location. We went on Saturday so it was a long wait, but our server made the night go smoothly as possible. Our server was Steve, he was amazing. He made sure that everything was good. :)"}
{"text":"This  CF location has gone down in the last year or so. We have noticed several service issues, especially when dining in the bar area.  At our last outing, our server took almost 10 minutes to come to the table after we sat down to greet us, pass out menus and take drink orders. She was slow to bring drinks, didn't bring a side salad that was requested before the meal. The food was subpar, and they totally botched my order by giving me the wrong dish.  Everyone's food also arrived lukewarm, like it had been sitting for a while.

We did address it with the manager who was apologetic and discounted the bill. We were treating an out of town guest who had never been to CF before and were totally embarrassed that we had brought him here. We walked out thinking we should have gone somewhere else in the South Park area. Eating out is becoming more and more of a luxury and it is disappointing when you got out expecting a nice dining experience and  get bad service and bad food. We will not be returning to CF anytime soon and I can no longer recommend it.

UPDATED :10/13/14- After making a complaint on the the company website regarding the above visit, we were sent a $25 e Gift  card. We redeemed the card at brunch  about a week a ago and had a good meal and great service. We intentionally sat in the restaurant, not the bar area. I don't know if I would ever have meal service in the bar area again. IMHO the servers are better trained in the restaurant area than those that serve in the bar area."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant one time for dinner. We had crab wontons as appetizer and they were really good and had us going and craving. Crispy, not so cheesy and didn't have the fishy taste. Dipped in a sweet and sour sauce with a touch of spice. We had bang bang chicken and shrimp, a Thai-inspired dish on white rice in a light coconut cream with curry and peanut sauce and hints of ginger and lemon grass. Although it seemed that they forgot to put the shrimp. We also had a combination of chicken madeira and dianne steak encrusted with black pepper and roasted mushroom. It was really a delightful experience. Grab a table on the porch if the weather is fine because it can get noisy inside. The brown bread served was soft and chewy and make sure you have it. Will be back to sample other dishes."}
{"text":"Having lived in California almost exclusively I was so excited to find there was  a Cheesecake Factory in Madison having enjoyed the locations in Pasadena and Brentwood for years. Our first trip there wasn't bad...Not up to the quality of the Cali locations but pretty good. 
Our second experience was a disaster. I ended up with food poisoning(my diagnosis not a doctor's, to be fair but I know that's what it was). I had a bacon cheeseburger and ordered it medium well. After my fourth bite my wife said, \"your burger looks raw!\" I looked and I saw a lot of pink. I will admit it tasted decent and I ate most of it mainly because I was starving and I knew how slow the service was so I'd probably wait 30 minutes or so for or a new one. My HUGE mistake! I ended up in the Sears bathroom feeling like Mike Tyson hit me in the gut about an hour later. I later became faint and ran a fever of 102. My wife tried to get me to go to the ER but I knew they'd only give me an IV of fluids and charcoal pills. So I proceeded to sweat it out, drenching our sheets and bed in sweat and spending every 30 minutes or so in our bathrooms for the next 18 hours. One more thing...And this was really bad...There was a mom and kid sitting at the bar eating Arby's(no joke). The mom ordered a drink and they proceeded to gobble up their fast food at the bar. I told our waiter that I worked in bars and restaurants in LA during college and that I had literally never seen that before and that it looked classless and was a joke that no one seemed to care. He said the manager had been told and had no problem with it. WTF? Almost every review on here from people who have eaten at other Cheesecake locations says this one is terrible in comparison. Things happen...I got sick and it could happen anywhere and I chose to continue eating a raw burger so it's partially my fault but the lack of caring of staff and management in allowing people to eat fast food at their bar is appalling. My next email or phone call is going to be to the corporate office Monday to tell them that this location is a disgrace to their brand name."}

{"text":"Went here for Father's Day and must say it was very disappointing.  When we walked in there was a 30-40 minute wait for any inside tables and no wait for outside. We checked outside and it was warm but comfortable and didn't plan on spending much time at the restaurant.  Once we were seated on the patio it took about 5 minutes before anyone even came to get our drink order. We placed our drink orders and then waited another 10 min or so.  We got our drinks and some bread (even though we asked for extra) and then ordered very simple dishes. As it was Father's Day there were other families nearby, and I watched as food came out to another table one plate at a time.  They then told the father his would be out in a few minutes, ten minutes later he gets his food and I was like wow that's horrible on Father's Day.  Then we waited and  waited and the same thing happened to us after being there for an hour.  Two of the five orders came out, then two more a few minutes later. Then my dish came out and he described it as a lunch size pasta and I said I didn't realize I had ordered a lunch size because I had not, I also noticed that it did not have the chicken in it that it was supposed to have.  I said it was fine due to waiting an hour and just asked if I could get the chicken. He took the dish back and then came back to say that our server made a mistake and  they are going to make a new one and it would be out in a few minutes. 15 min later it comes out after my family had pretty much finished their meals.  I asked the server why everything was taking so long and he said ya know the Father's Day brunch and whatnot, which didn't make sense because the patio was only 1/4 full.  Anyways the pasta is the one I get every time and the sauce was like soup.  After being on the patio for over an hour and a half it was time to go as the sun had been hitting us and we should have been out of there a lot sooner.  Definitely not the most enjoyable Father's Day experience which is a huge let down as it is one of our favorite places.  Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious cheesecake as always. Food is what you'd expect from the chain. It has a large variety to chose from and it definitely takes a few minutes to look through all of their choices.

We ordered the nachos as an appetizers and was a lot more than the 2 of us imagined, (I'm 6'3\" so I'm not some small guy), but we managed to eat what 3-4 people could enjoy. 

We ended up taking our cheesecake home for later because of how full we were so its always a treat to have something to look forward to."}
{"text":"What a absolute disaster !   Worst service I think I have ever had since being here in Las Vegas.  Server was terrible, half of our party didnt even get their meals before we left.  Manager gave a few of us a free desert... Big frickin deal.   Will not return."}
{"text":"always love the cheesecake factory!!! just never have room for dessert unless you do a doggy bag and eat the dessert half way thru."}
{"text":"I don't really come here a lot because it's always insanely busy (when I would go, anyway) and the wait is like a million years long. I went with a friend here last Friday spur of the moment and she called ahead to see what the wait was. They told her over the phone there was no wait and when she showed up before me like 10-15 minutes later the wait was all of a sudden 40 minutes long. What. Thankfully, she knew someone and she was able to get a table quicker.

I got there when she was already seated and the crowd was out of control. It seems there's no rhyme or reason to the throng of people because everyone stands in a big huddle and sometimes blocks the entrance. Annoying. We had a nice man as our waiter and his customer service was fabulous. We weren't ignored and he was prompt in coming back to fill water and get our orders. I loved the bread that comes out while we waited for our food. We both ordered salads - for me a Luau salad and for my friend a Cobb. Who orders salads at Cheesecake Factory, right? Ha.

When they came out, it was like 2-3 portions on one plate. My salad has a variety of flavors and ingredients. It was really, really good. In the middle of the salad there were these two flat pieces of something crunchy. It tasted like it was coated with something sweet and sesame seeds. I took a few bites of it and scooped my salad with it. The customer service and food (enough for a good amount of leftovers!) was great! I don't prefer the crowd and wait times though."}
{"text":"Am not into cheesecake so why would I go here? My friends wanted to go! I love chocolate, and they had selections of chocolate cake that were not cheesecake. We got the cake to go and did not do sit down service. I got the chocolate tower truffle cake. It was incredible. It had a fudgy layer, then airy bread, then very light mousse. The lightness of the cake with the heavier fudge made it a great combination. It was pleasant for the palate, not too heavy or too sweet. I asked for extra whipped cream. It was great to have extra whipped cream because the cream was not sweet. It was also neutral and light, which helped with eating the heavier fudge part of the cake. It also lasted me 6 days to eat everyday. Loved it!!! Such a good deal!"}
{"text":"Grilled artichoke is amazing service was amazing and chipotle chicken pasta AMAAAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"the hostess are so unprofessional every time we come here. right now we are by the  entrance waiting for a table and the hostess are talking to each other making fun and comments of the people. horrible attention!! I myself had to tell them to shut up . And right now the manager came by and in the moment he turn around they laugh at him. Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving them 5 stars today (not because of the food - which was very good) but for the excellent service we received.  I was truly amazed and how friendly and helpful they were (even with out stubborn 3 yr old)

The food was excellent - 4 star worthy, not 5 star because I have had better pasta.  My wife got a salad that looked great and my kid got the macaroni and cheese (which I snuck a bite of - and it was amazing)

Good food, better service = 5 stars in my book.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, great service as always but very loud music that makes it hard to have a conversation. Waitress politely informed me that they could not turn it down."}
{"text":"Love their pretzel covered chicken and of course, you gotta get the cheesecake.
Plan on a large serving and a long wait. The service is good but it's almost always crazy busy. It is worth the wait! Also, you're close to other people usually."}
{"text":"I like coming here between lunch and dinner rush. You usually get seated pretty quickly. I've been here several times and the servers have always been friendly. The food always comes out the way it should, but there seems to be some consistency issues as far as how often the servers check up on you. Some seem to just disappear for a while and you end up flagging down the next one you see to get a refill.  Not a deal breaker for me but I don't like troubling someone else's server. I give this place a 4 for food value and service."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place but the line was sooooooo long and overwhelming. If you expect to be seated as soon as you arrive you are def wrong!
The cheese cake is out of this world, literally the tastiest cake I've eaten to date.
also the chicken sliders were realllllly tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"Came for dessert for a birthday. The cheesecake is of course, awesome. Portion s are HUGE. We split the cookie dough cheese cake a la mode. The ice cream is so good...the menu says its exclusively made for the Cheesecake Factory by Edys: YUM. It was all so good and one slice is definitely enough for two!  We sat on the outside patio and it was beautiful. Service was great and we were seated right away on a Saturday night at 10pm.  They even pre-split the cheesecake for us since they knew we were sharing, and my friends was decorated for her birthday with a candle and sprinkles! Nice touch, Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Minimal wait time. Waitress was on top of her game. Keep checking on our drinks, kept bringing bread, and was friendly. Ordered fettuccini Alfredo and it was cooked perfectly. Not too hot so I was able to eat as soon as I got my plate. A bit pricey ($15) but good service"}
{"text":"Love the service excellent food fairly priced drinks and food would come back in a heart beat our waitress is so great!!!!"}
{"text":"The world famous Cheesecake Factory.

Not much different from the others, which is fine by me since I'm a fan of the place. The food here is what I would call \"splurge\" food---it's really unhealthy and oily---but, if you're at the Cheesecake Factory, that's probably what you're going for anyway. As much as I love eating their super flavored, greasy food, sometimes it's just overpowering and makes me feel a sense of \"ugh\" inside. For example, I got their Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp, and as much as I love eating flavorful things, I thought that the meal was just really heavy for me at the end. Also, the crabcake appetizer I had was really heavy and I didn't know if I even wanted to eat my main entree. Other than the huge dump of calories in my body, I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. The decor is Disneyworld-like and really gets you in the mood to have fun.

And oh yeah, please try the Cheesecake, it's something that you won't want to miss out on."}
{"text":"I heard the food was supposed to be really good. But unfortunately the food for the price we paid was not good. 

It seemed like the cooks didn't know how to use the spices correctly with the pastas because the Louisiana chicken pasta that I ordered didn't have much flavor to it, but the chicken was good. 3 star pasta

The burger was undercooked. My friend said he would take the Whataburger burger over the burger he ordered at the Cheesecake Factory. 2 star burger 

The only thing that tasted for what we paid for was the filet mignon. 4 star filet 

We also had eggplants which were really good and they came with a side dish of pasta with pesto which was completely tasteless. Probably the worst pasta I have ever tried anywhere. It was almost like eating pasta with water. The manager came over replacing the pasta with a pasta Alfredo which was excellent. 3 star eggplant

Our server was very young and very tall, he said he turned 21 just 2 weeks ago. He started off really bad and didn't even smile. Later on it got better. We gave him a hard time ordering which he handled pretty good but kept forgetting somethings and misunderstood some other things. 3 star service.

So it's a little bit but it miss with how good your food was. Except for the burger. 

I would say let the Cheesecake Factory keep on making cheese cakes and not full restaurant menus. For me the first and last time eating out here. 

Also one thing that raised my concern was that my friend saw one of the cooks spit to his side. We couldn't see if he spit on the food or on the floor or he just had a gum in his mouth. Ether way, I don't believe you should ever spit anywhere when you handle the food."}
{"text":"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fanatic and this one was a slight disappointment. The hostess at the front was busy talking to someone else, the hostess that sat us down was blah and didn't say you're welcome after we said thank you. She might as well have been working at Denny's. Our waitress didn't greet us and looked annoyed and we later found out she was and it was with the bus boy. Towards the end it got better but for the most part a little ghetto as far as attitude. Food is always good, but I'd rather go to the Grand Lux at the Venetian."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go, Cheesecake Factory is among the better choices you'll find. Yes, the menu is ridiculously large. Yes, the wait for a table is ridiculously long, but you're typically in for a decent meal...especially when you eventually find those one or two dishes that actually resonate with your own taste buds. Of course, that's not an easy task.

It's a good place to take people because they have something for every taste in their menu, but until you find some go-to choices, you could easily be disappointed, as my wife and I will tell you...it's hardly worth the hour or hour-and-a-half wait, but without the wait, it's a great place for a quick bite.

Also, even when you find your favorite dish, a great meal is never guaranteed. For me, the orange chicken is excellent, but it's a 50-50 toss-up whether or not they'll get my side right. I simply ask for STEAMED carrots, as I can't stand the oily vegetables the meal usually comes with, but I'm often served exactly the side I described disliking upon ordering. Generally, the wait staff that I have is nice about it, and immediately fixes it, but it's still frustrating that they get it wrong so often.

Known for their epic portions, and yummy cheesecake, neither are misleading reputations. Most meals, even in lunch portion, are so gluttonous that you'll likely be taking leftovers with you. Especially at the cost, you're not going to want to just waste your meal.

Aside from the few issues that I've mentioned, I've had way more positive meals and experiences at Cheesecake Factory than not. They do a surprisingly good job with almost every dish, and considering the numerous cooking styles the chefs are responsible for preparing, that's an impressive feat. It's generally a safe bet for a decent meal. Not to mention, I do like quite a few of their appetizers. The ahi carpaccio, although a little heavy on the sauces, is really good, as are the factory nachos and avocado eggrolls. My other favorite thing is the unsweetened iced green tea. I can drink that all day. 

Regardless, you're probably only there for dessert anyway, and that's the one area that I've never been disappointed in. Best cheesecake ever? I wouldn't go anywhere near that far, but it's as rich and fulfilling as you'd expect, and should please the majority."}
{"text":"Ich kannte Cheesecake Factory aus San Francisco. Der Laden im Caesars Palace in Vegas war etwas legerer mit kleinerer Auswahl, aber trotzdem sehr lecker mit zuvorkommender Bedienung, selbst für US-Verhältnisse.
Wie gesagt befindet sich dieses Restaurant im Caesars Palace, und zwar am Ende der Forum Shops. Nicht verpassen!"}
{"text":"My son gave us a gift certificate and we could not have been more pleased. We've been to other Cheesecake Factories but not this location. FABULOUS! Service was good but the Kale & Quinoa salad was off the charts. We also had the Portofino Pizza which could be as good a pie I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair, the smell of the Cheesecake Factory was rising up through the air, OK I will focus now, bus seriously I am living in Henderson Nevada now and it kind of felt that way

Tried the happy hour here on a Tuesday night. Nice, comfy chain place, bar area was well lit, bartender was attentive and professional, definitely not lacking in service, 5 stars here. Stayed for 2 hours had a couple glasses of house Chardonnay, $5.95 & yummy. Going to go back and do another Happy, this time with the food. Driving home I could have sworn I heard the nightman say we are programmed to receive, you can drive home anytime you want but you can never leave..."}
{"text":"First time here, and  we had the salmon, burger and my son had the pizza (kids). My son had his Pizza straight away while we waited for over an hour for ours. He was restless and over it so we had to eat fast and go. The Salmon was overcooked and dry. My serving had fries which were stone cold. 
Cant say we will be back which is quite unfortunate as we have been looking forward to coming here."}
{"text":"Very good happy hour with very good prices. My wife had the chicken spring rolls and I had the fried chicken sliders. Both had very generous portions and tasted great.  Excellent service was icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with a friend and the thing I love about this chain is that it's CONSISTENTLY good. From Los Angeles to Las Vegas, I have eaten my way across state borders via Cheesecake Factories.

First thing is that this place doesn't take reservations but a table for 2-4 people averages at 15 to 20 minutes of wait time. That's reasonable on a Saturday night, most restaurants are terrible with wait times.

Ordered the Four Cheese Pasta with Chicken and the Red Velvet Cheescake for dessert. Two words: REALLY GOOD. The portions are huge and really you can split it between two people. I had a ton of leftovers for later.

Service was fast and good, the inside of the restaurant is classy and nice, no complaints. Will be back."}
{"text":"They reached out to us and made it right. That counts for a lot in my book. We revisited them again and the service wasn't as hectic and disorganized as before. We were promptly seated and the food was good as usual.

I only wish they wouldn't arrange their tables so closely together. People are thrusting butts and crotches in faces everywhere trying to squeeze in. Awkward."}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for over 20 minutes waiting on my slice of cheesecake.  I came in and ordered, according to my receipt Shannon helped me.  It's pre-cut.  I understand a slight wait, but 20 minutes when there is only 1 other woman waiting and she is waiting on food to be made....  What is the hold up?!  I'm currently looking at 3 of them back behind the counter.  One is on the phone and the other is getting slices out to take to tables.  I understand serving tables first, but seriously?!  Over 20 minutes?!?!

Not to mention woman just came in after me and got hers right away?!  Seriously?!  Am I invisible right here in your line of sight?!"}
{"text":"The lines for The Cheesecake Factory are still insane to eat in, but today I got a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake for take out, it's really expensive at $9.95 + tax but it was a nice treat.

The cheesecake was very smooth and creamy, had great flavour and texture. It seemed to taste better than when I had it at US stores, maybe it's just extra fresh cause of the high turnover at this location. I'd come again to maybe get a whole cheesecake next time."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. The service was amazing, the manager even came over at one point and told us not to worry our food was on its way (while my boyfriend and I didn't even think it had been a long time.)

The food was just okay. We got calamari as an appetizer, it was good, but just a little to chewy. My pasta was bland..and for $16 dollars I've had way better pasta. My boyfriend got a hamburger and he asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it came out well done. While this dinner experience was just meh I've had a lot better food from here..so all hope isn't lost! 

Then we both got a piece of cheesecake which was super scrumptious so at least there was that! 

If anything we'll probably give this place another try for lunch at some point."}
{"text":"Ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta to go. They have curbside pick up so I just pulled up and called the number on the sign and a server came out with my food. When I got home I noticed half the amount of chicken ( I've ordered this dish a few times) so I was a little disappointed with that."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service was all over the place, but mostly bad. We were forgotten and remembered too many times. We wanted to order cheesecake at the end of the meal, but got so sick of waiting we just said check please. We waited for that too for far too long. Again the food was really good. Service not so much."}
{"text":"I've been to many Cheesecake Factories around the country and I was just as happy with my experience here.  We had a large party and were fed relatively quickly.  I do wish the wait staff would have cleaned our table more regularly and given us a bit more time between the appetizer and the mail course.  The pan fried Salmon and pasta was delicious, maybe the best restaurant cooked Salmon I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in AZ.  We brought a party of 9 on a Saturday around 6pm, so we were afraid we'd be waiting for hours.  We arrived and were greeted by friendly, organized staff at the front desk.  A manager quickly walked the restaurant and found a section that we could be seated at within 40 minutes.  We expected the wait and waited only about 30 before we were seated.  I had 2 small children and 4 teenage girls...I thought dinner would be mahem.  The waitress was attentive and the food quality was wonderful.  She even came back to make conversation with my daughter and her friends and explained menu items to them.  The value was great too, we fed all 9 people appetizers, dinner and desserts for less than $200."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is located in a shopping center.  It opens at 11.  My girl and I had the herb crusted salmon, steak quesadilla and cookies & cream cheesecake.  

The service was flawlessly executed.  The food was ok-nothing noteworthy.  Typical fat laden, oversized portions restaurant."}
{"text":"I love  sweets 
and this place has my favorite cake
Mango  Key lime  and
Original cheese cake
always clean and nice"}
{"text":"My go to dish would be the shrimp scampi with angel hair. You can never go wrong with that dish. My date went with the combination of the salmon dish with steak perfect for if you can't decide and want both. Proportion at and it comes with mashed potatoes. It stayed busy from when we walked in and even became busier when we were leaving."}
{"text":"I loved Cheesecake Factory until today...I visited as soon as they opened at Southpark more than 10 years ago and have been back often!
Today I purchased a slice of the birthday cheesecake TO GO....which came to $11 with a tip from TAKEOUT!
I stopped to pump gas and my puppy ate 1/2 of it by the time I noticed....I immediately called them and explained that the slice was for my child.  I have a 30 minute drive home....they kept me on hold to ask a manager for over 15 minutes who told me sorry they could not replace the slice......
Oh well...thats the last time I solicit Cheesecake either in Charlotte or elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've always had great service here and the food has been excellent. Favorite thing to order is the tomato basil or the shepherds pie. The red velvet cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"The dishwasher Daniel Keiser really made sure the plates were extra clean only some poop on mine.."}
{"text":"Watch carefully as they prepare a table after another party has left. Napkins are placed on the seats before they are then placed on the plates. Busboy then touches every piece of cutlery with his dirty hands as he placed the cutlery in direct contact with the table. The table is only wiped down with some rag. No attempt to sanitize the table or cutlery. No attempt to keep the napkins clean. 

Regarding service, empty plates were not promptly taken. Waitress's shift ended during our stay and so she \"transferred\" our table to another waitress. Had to ask for a knife. Also asked for a new fork hoping it would be cleaner than the ones left on the table. Drinks were not refilled promptly. Bread also was not brought promptly.

Won't come again."}
{"text":"Considering I wasn't expecting much from America's most unhealthy restaurant, I have to admit, I walked out not totally put-off. So, first, the obvious... Yes, this place is way over priced. And yes, most dishes have an average of 1,000,000 calories. But, I looked a little harder at their novel of a menu and discovered their \"skinnylicious\" offerings. I question how some of these items (fried samosas, I'm looking at you!) are considered skinnylicious, but I'll let that go for now. 

I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. The menu touts it as less than 590 calories. I wonder how many servings come on the plate though... It had 3 chicken breasts, for crying out loud! Anywho, I ate about half the plate and boxed the rest to go. It was tasty, with LOTS of oven roasted cherry tomatoes, capers, asparagus and artichoke. Expensive at $16.95 though! The price you pay for less calories? Go figure. 

I landed here on an office outing. While I wouldn't ever choose it myself, I also might not shudder at the thought of going back if the need ever arises again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery thru one of those services.  Got a burger, fries and cheesecake.  Even though food arrived 15 minutes before that what they said, which was great, the fries were cold.

Hamburger was cooked as I requested, most places get that wrong, but it was nothing special.

Never had their cheesecake before and I thought it was average, which was disappointing considering the name of their company.

Delivery driver was super nice."}
{"text":"We were lucky to have a 10-min wait time, there's  so many people it can be intimidating...

Four Cheese Pasta is so delicious, I've never drooled over such a simple dish. Our waitress was nice and we didn't get mad about waiting to be served since she was trying her best to navigate to other tables. I have no complaints, everything was great. The only downside I can mention is the wait time and occupancy number. It's -very- crowded."}
{"text":"I totally forgot that I ordered the Fettucini Alfredo with chicken so I ordered it again. Don't bother ordering the chicken (extra charge) as it doesn't add anything to the pasta. 

A nice surprise was the Cheesecake Factory House Red - for $30 a bottle, it was quite good. I usually don't drink wine and ended up having two glasses of it. 

I got a Raspberry Chocolate Cheesecake as take-out and my sister and I shared it later in the evening. For $7, it's expensive, but perfect for a sweet tooth like me!"}
{"text":"45 minute wait for our meal today at lunch. If it weren't for the lunch time rush I'd give them one star. Been to many CCFs across the country. We've been to this one awhile back. This time they ruined a perfectly wonderful outing with my wife due to the poor service.
There are too many good restaurants in Scottsdale, AZ to take a chance of this happening again."}
{"text":"Sat outside to enjoy the beautiful Las Vegas day we were having. Couple other parties out there enjoying the day like us. Clouds were coming and going so a nice little warmth of sun here and there. Then a party of 3 adults and 2 kids come outside and instantly complains about the sun..so down the blinds go. Ugh really! Don't sit outside then. It was beautiful outside and not hot at all! Mind you we spent $125 plus tip for 2 people and we don't get a say in the blinds. Ridiculous! Put a damper on the day for sure.  Second week in a row we were there thought we had found our Monday date day spot for sure but now I could care less about going back. Whatever"}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time I'm in a town that has one I've got to go. Cause the service and the food are always awesome. Even though located in the Forum Shops in Ceasars Palace, my wife and I were able to get a table without waiting at 6pm."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good! I love the Teriyaki Chicken and rice dinner. The only reason I give this restaurant four stars is because it is always so busy. They don't offer call ahead seating and don't do reservations, so the wait can be long. It's definitely a good place to eat though! Sit out front so you can see the statue show and aquarium!"}
{"text":"OK it's official.  I don't like the Cheesecake Factory.  I've tried it a few times, and I'm not a chain snob.  Bring me some Bertucci's and I'm happy.  But here?  No.  Just no.  I don't get it.

The food is utterly mediocre (I suppose what does one expect, from a *factory*), and personally I find the portions an affront to good taste.  They are disgusting!  It's like a trough.  Anyone who can eat a whole plate of their food in one sitting needs to get help.  It's also waaaay overpriced.  I guess you're paying for quantity, not quality?  I mean you get enough food to feed yourself for a week.

The decor is so confused and charmless.  I feel like I'm on an acid trip when I'm in there--an acid trip that's gone very, very wrong and you've forgotten that life isn't a Lewis Carroll-ian hellscape.

One extra star for good service and good cheesecake.  But overall I can definitively say I won't be back to this particularly wretched chain."}
{"text":"I've visited this location for lunch a few times with work associates and every time the food and service has been great. I love the strawberry lemonade they serve -- perfect balance of sweet and sour. Their beef dip sandwich, fish & chips, and Cuban sandwich I all highly recommend. And of course you can't go wrong with any of their delicious cheesecakes! I didn't get a chance to try it on account of being too full on my last visit, but what looks suuuuper appetizing is the Oreo cheesecake with whole Oreos actually inside the cheesecake! I will definitely be back for a slice of that. :D"}
{"text":"What a success this place this is! Every table is taken, people willing to wait for up to an hour for a table and the patrons look happy.

Used a gift card for chicken potstickers and mixed veggie salad with added chicken. The potstickers were actually tasty and the shoyu sauce pleasing. Pal commented on how pure and unburpy the meat was. Loved the green onions on it.

The mixed salad had a lot of cheese chunks and mixtures of salad, asparagus and stuff. Don't remember a heavy or creamy dressing, but it was flavorful enough not to miss it.

Great service."}
{"text":"What can I say, the restaurant is pretty. As soon as you walk in the door, the aesthetics of the place is wonderful. The way the tables are positioned, all of the vegetation, and not to mention the ceiling is amazing. I don't like the little tables though, there really isn't enough room for 2 people and all the dinnerware, it seems crowded.

The food? Fantastic! I have eaten here many times and I try to get something different every time I go and I have not been disappointed. The crusted chicken romano is a must, so is the stuffed chicken marsala. For some reason, when I've had a dish with marsala sauce, it seems over powering with the wine, but not at Cheesecake Factory. They get it just right to where you can taste the mushrooms and other flavors with your meal. Their garlic mashed potatoes are to die for! They use red potatoes instead of russet or yellow potatoes. The texture is a little lumpy, yet smooth all at the same time. 

Let's not forget their cheesecake. That's the reason why you came right? There are 2 pages of cheesecake selections in the menu. All of their cheesecake is wonderful, but make sure you have a glass of water or milk handy because most of their cheesecakes are RICH! They range from your traditional cheesecake with strawberries to a carrot cake cheesecake. If you're a peanut butter fan like myself, fear not, they have about 3 different kind of cheesecake with peanut butter. Let's not forget their carrot cake!! The 1st time I had their carrot cake was at Barnes & Nobles and it was like my mom used to make. Dreamy!

As for the wait, be prepared to wait 15-30 minutes on the weekend at least and during the week about 10-15 minutes to get seated. Never have I gone to the restaurant and gotten seated immediately. It's well worth the wait and what better way to wait at the bar? I'm a Long Island kind of girl, but I have had their cranberry and vodka. Their liquor is all top shelf and I always had a well mixed drink, nothing overpowering in 1 liquor. 

The wait staff is knowledgeable and very polite. I've had only 1 server that was pretty bad, but that was because we were his last table and we were taking our sweet time. Yes, it's still not an excuse to be rude and try to rush people out, but overall, I haven't had really bad service.

Cons: 
Long wait to be seated.
Noise, sometimes can't hear what your company is saying to you across the table from you.
Little tables."}
{"text":"This was our third visit here.. More than likely our last. Our friend ordered the So. Fried catfish and it had a very strong oder of ammonia and she said it tasted even worse. My husband ordered the chicken burrito grande, and it was mostly made up of rice and cilantro. Very few pieces of chicken. He and our friend sent the entrée back. We asked for a manager and this lady basically wanted nothing to do with owning any mistakes. She did not apologize for the mistakes, she only made excuses. Our server, however, was extremely apologetic and nice. I believe her name is Skylar H, which is the name on the receipt. So kudos to her! She was a fantastic server! Unfortunately, we won't come back due to the lack of ownership in management. Our entire experience was ruined it seemed from the moment we walked in."}
{"text":"Oh my, I was so hungry. Being Celiac it's common place to watch other people eat while they try to explain how barbecue sauce is gluten-free. I remembered CCF has a GF option. Brandon S was amazingly patient. What a doll! The first thing I ordered wasn't available so the kitchen whipped me up this masterpiece. The corn cakes with grilled chicken on top. This was the best ever. The flavors of savory, sweet with the corn kernel crunch. Made my toes curl! Deliciousness. Thank you staff, chef and management."}
{"text":"Here it is date night with my better half. Arrived around 6 PM on a Thursday night and the place was busy. We were immediately seated which was nice. My wife ordered Ahi Tuna Salad and I ordered the Truffle-Honey Chicken.
I forgot that the chicken comes boneless,shucks. I left the crispy chicken on the mashed potatoes too long and the bottom of the chicken had a soggy coating. Overall, it was a great meal and my wife enjoyed her salad.
Of course, we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service was terrible. My waiter made a series of rude jokes to my family and we never once got a refill on our drinks. It took 30 minutes for our cheesecake to come and when I ordered a piece to go he gave me a much tinier piece than the others. Totally not worth the $8 I spent on it."}
{"text":"@ Cheescake Factory.. thanks for copy and pasting your response from all other review responses.. makes it feel real personal!..."}
{"text":"Pork Belly sliders pretty good with fried pickles and coleslaw. Four good size sliders. French Country salad with beets, goat cheese, asparagus, and pecans had sparse ingredients and under-dressed. Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp with sugar snap peas and shiitake mushrooms in sweet and spicy sauce served with white rice came with super dry chicken bits, no shrimp, and uncooked rice. Server told manager who ordered just shrimp to add onto my plate, but they redid order with more dry chicken, but no pineapple which made the sauce taste different. I had to take from new plate and dip into sauce of original plate. I'm not sure what happened but I think I got three different types of shrimp. Some were medium size, others super small, and one larger one that had the shell including tail still on. I think maybe they were out of shrimp and sent original plate out hoping patron was too drunk to notice there was no shrimp. It is just sad that if you were going to fake a dish that you would at least cook the chicken well. Neither the server or manager cared to notice I barely touched the plate. Btw, you'all need to trim your sugar snap peas so it's edible and won't choke anyone."}

The Cheesecake Factory was on her bucket list. Ever since she relocated to North Carolina that's all she's been talking about. I received two tickets to see \"The Space Between Us\" and decided to make the evening a girls night. 

We grabbed dinner then had the most amazing cheesecake! We arrived around 5ish and sat near the bar. At first my niece was overwhelmed with the wide selection of cheesecake. She finally settled on the Oreo Cheesecake. I had the original with strawberries on top. Of course it was DELICIOUS!!!! 
Our waitress Danielle was very patient and kind. 

I've been to this location once before in college. My Mother Loves the food, I'm not a fan. Yes, the cheesecake is good, but the food lacks flavor. Maybe Im ordering the wrong thing. Of course I'm willing to try again for the sake of my niece. Our next adventure will be Brunch.

Thank you to Danielle for giving my niece an unforgettable experience! She truly enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! From the staff to the food, you won't forget the experience you have at this place. Food is always fresh. And don't forget to pick up a few slices of cheesecake before you leave"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. This was our first time visiting this location and it was our favorite experience thus far. The service was excellent, the food was cooked perfectly and the portions were great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have always loved Cheesecake Factory, but this experience ruined it. This was our first and last time at this location. We were here for a Family party and it was the most unpleasant dining experience we have ever had. To start, we were to wait 45 minutes for our table, which is completely understandable on a weekend. Come to find out, the table they prepared was the wrong size, so we then had to wait an additional 20 minutes for another one.
     Upon ordering our appetizer, we we're excited to get a side of our favorite sauce. We got the attention of another server who said she would take care of it. No one ever came. We were given the wrong drinks twice. After ordering our entrees, we wait OVER AN HOUR for the food to come out.The waitress avoided us so we had a hard time even getting her attention. We got the attention of another server TWICE to see a manager. Nothing for about 20 minutes. 
     Finally, when the manager comes by the table, she informs us she had just been told by the cook that our server had forgotten to put in the order. She laughed it off and offered cheesecake. 
     Had we been in the know, it may have made it a little better. Our server not once apologized and instead seemed to avoid our area for most of the night. Not to mention my two nieces are under two years old and were starving. 
     The head manager ended up coming over and fixing the situation. While I do appreciate that, I can't justify more than one star. This was supposed to be a special family event and the experience was anything but special."}
{"text":"I'm definitely torn between 3 and 4 stars. But since it was better than I thought it was going to be, I'll round up. It was my first visit since usually over the top chain restaurants aren't my thing. But, lo and behold, I found myself there with a friend the other night. I felt like I walked through a narnia door of West Towne Mall into a Vegas casino restaurant. It's a huge place, and was pretty busy on a Friday night. But we got a table right away. The menu was extremely aggravating. It was too large - too many pages and too many sections. And fine, yes it's good to list calories so everyone knows how much they're going to eat, the calories in everything there was appalling. I mean, it didn't stop me, but still appalling. The only way to get a meal under 1000 kcal is to order from the Skinnylicious menu. Yes, that's what's it's called. Is this place especially built for pre-bachelorette party dinners? Grrr. One last complaint, our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, but way too overbearing. She must have stopped by our table 20 times just to check on us. If you're wondering if I gave them four stars by mistake, hang in there. We had cocktails that were amazing and our food was fantastic. I loved my Asian pear martini and the miso salmon was delicious. The Korean cauliflower was ok,but it had too much breading. Wine/beer list was ok. And yes, the cheesecake was good. Not best thing I've ever eaten good, but yummy. Service was overall very good. Everything was served in such large quantities that we had a lot of leftovers. I won't rush back, but I'll be much less dubious when friends tell me how much they like the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"This is nestled in the outlet mall. The menu is pretty standard and the service was actually not up-to-par with some of my other Cheesecake Factory visits in Southern California.

Their \"patio\" is actually an indoor patio area- which I think is smart.

Parking is whatever the outlet mall has to offer (which may get busy on some days).

This place was a-ok."}
{"text":"GROSS....Waiter can you please identify what this hard chunk is in my tartar saice? It was a chunk of cauliflower. AND a chuck so big I had no sauce left after it was fished out. Hmmmm. My crispy crab bites come with a mustard sauce but it was white like pure mayo. I've never seen white mustard... but....
The special dietary request on the tortilla salad... no... avocado sauce on salad... well it was on salad. Add chicken.... waited for chicken to come as it was forgotten. 
The manager did come by about the chicken but did not address the stuff in my tartar sauce that grossed everyone out that we packed up to leave. 
This company does not have child friendly cups. What we got was a flimsy plastic cup with a lid and a straw that was so soft it implodes in the hands of a two year old. No coloring placemats, no crayons. At least that's what our waiter said. There were so many kids in the restaurant you wonder why they don't make any effort to make it kid friendly. We ordered the child's chicken grilled. It had so much pepper on it and spicy she threw it up. Spicy grilled chicken for a toddler?  Luckily we tasted it but it was too late. Oh the Manager? Fogettaboutit. 
Horrible experience at a chain WHERE THIS JUST SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. . We will probably NEVER return to this location. 
We are grossed out."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains that I not only like, but I think is pretty good.

This location is conveniently located inside The District. It's on the opposite side from most of the shopping so parking is easy. Just like most of their locations they have an enormous amount of seating and outdoor seating as well. The patio is a nice option when the weather is nice.

The menu has a large amount of options and a large variety of options as well. There should be something here to please everyone. I like that a group could come in and order completely different foods. Surprisingly, everything I've had is really good. They are one of the few places that can pull off a large menu without sacrificing taste. The portions are always big enough to make into two meals. I love fun lunch leftovers.

This is one of the few restaurants that make it easy for someone on a diet if you aren't looking to treat yourself. The Skinnylicious menu has some great options and the calories are listed on the menu. They couldn't make it easier for someone counting calories.

The cheesecake lives up to the hype and just like the regular menu there are a ridiculous amount of options. My favorite is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. 

Pricing is reasonable for the portion sizes. As I mentioned, most entrees are big enough to be two or three servings for the average person.

I've been to this location many times and service has always been great. Despite the fact that they are always busy it never takes long to get food and drinks are refilled promptly."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service , been there to get a whole cheese cake for pick up and it took them 42 minutes to bring my order and at the end I was at least expecting an apology from the staff but .... I am so sorry for the management of this location ."}
{"text":"Why is it so loud in here? It seemed like I could hear people's conversations that were sitting in the front near the bar, but we were all the way against the back wall. Dishes clanking, slamming of whatever it was in the kitchen. Ugh! I don't mind noise, I'm loud and I have kids who are never quiet...but, omg this place is loud. 

The food is always good and I loooove their passion fruit iced tea. I had the always amazing chicken Madeira, and the hubs had fish and chips. Both were quite good and the portion size definitely wasn't lacking. We finished up with a piece of s'mores cheesecake which sent us both right in to food coma.

Service was okay. Our waiter had zero personality and seemed to be overwhelmed with his section. 
But, the food was so good that I kind of looked past this."}
{"text":"OK so why does it always take a bad experience to bring me to Yelp to post a review!

I love adding food pictures (944 of them if you want to know) , but tonight there was no food, so inevitably there are no photos of food.     

Why you may ask?       

Well, let me explain.

It was around 9:45pm or so when we entered the restaurant, there were no lines or waiting, so we (my wife and I) were promptly seated in what I will refer to as man bun hell.

After being seated between two groups of folks along the bar seating area, we were just getting a taste of the evenings adventure as it took approx 5-6 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered ONE Chicken Marsala to be split, It was not long after that our bread and water arrived, but that was all.  By now it was around 10pm as this was clearly stated by our guest at the table beside us as it was getting late and they were ready to leave.  It was about 5 minutes later that the table to the  right of us received their meals and they had time to finish their food even after ordering 5 deserts to go.  At last look, it was 10:38, we had run out of time, patience and understanding.  Our server appeared to be distracted by a table we will refer to as \"friends\" since he was at that table for at least ten minutes - socializing.

He did bring by an empty plate for us to share our meal should it ever arrive.  We received two refills during this time. At no time was an apology given for the lack of food coming from the kitchen.  The table to the right was cleaned and a new group of four guest were seated.  The hostess stated that they would be taken care of \"she promised\"......I stated that \"they should not believe the lies\", as we were obviously not taken care of.  They brought this to their service attention, but our own server arrived and I made it clear that we were leaving.  He suggested that we speak to a manager, however it was too late.  I stopped by the hostess stand but the manager came by.

During this time, the server was observed laughing and showing no interest toward any guest.

Upon leaving the restaurant I called and was promptly placed on hold for seven minutes.

I understand busy nights, but this was just not the case.

I will be following up on this review........"}
{"text":"This is One of the example of downfall of corporate restaurant.  I have been there almost 3 times in the last 2 month.  Service is ok..depending on who you get as server. This last Saturday we sat at the bar and service was not good.  Food is not consistent.  I ordered the time before the specialty menu \" Thai coconut lime curry dishes and the server told me that it would be better than chandler where I enjoyed first time, because his chef is the best. Well not true because it was far from what it is in chandler.  Did not taste at all good as chandler.  I work in this industry and I know what managers do.  This place the managers just stand  and walk around without even greeting their guests.  We were there another Saturday and it was busy, we stood by the cake display waiting for our table, 3 managers, stood by the hostess stand ( I assume a GM, AGM and a floor manager, no smile and no greeting with guests) and no manager ever on the floor checking if your food is good and how is service going. Like I said they just stand and walk around.  Please be proactive and talk to your guests and you would find out a lot of interesting things for your job.  and tell the servers to be more attentive and friendlier.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I went for lunch the other day with 2 friends. I ordered the not creamy lemon chicken thing. We also ordered 3 appetizers and 1 other entre. We were there for over 1.5 hours as our food took 40 minutes to see.  It was a monday afternoon.
They sat a lady next to the 3 of us 15 minutes after we ordered and she received her food before we did. Terrible. When I finally got my entre it looked good... The mashed potatoes were great. A bit dry after a minute but at first delicious. The chicken although tasted like they had taken an entire lemon and just squirted it on top. Eek. My eyes were twitching. 
So I asked the server to please exchange it for the creamy fried herb  lemon chicken my friend had. It's an 18$ dish. It doesnt seem too expensive at first. But when you receive it the chicken is pounded very thin. The outside is not crunchy like you would hope for from breaded chicken. It's nothing more than a large chicken nugget. Tuna appetizer was very small and not the best. The potstickers were just ok. In my opinion it was mediocre. And not worth $120."}
{"text":"It's a bit busy despite the fact that it is a big restaurant. We were here for lunch and ordered the miso salmon and breakfast burrito. The wheat bread that we received was very delicious and it's worth a try! The food took a bit but they offered banana slides for our toddler which was very helpful to keep his attention! Our waitress Stefani was very friendly and gave us a honest option when it came to order the food which I really appreciated! She was attentive and took great care of us! The food was flavorful and the portions are big! The cheesecakes are great too specially the caramel one! I'd definitely eat here again! The only issue I would point out but it's not worth deduction a star was that the bathrooms were out of order (family bathroom and one of the women's bathroom). However, after pointing it out they immediately tried to fix it - great service!!"}
{"text":"Cold Crappy Food, Over and Over...

Why do I Torture myself every time.

The Manager is W E A K !!!

{"text":"I feel a little silly rating this chain but here's my justification:

For some reason, I don't know why, but the Cheesecake Factory in King of Prussia was amazing, and I expected the same when I went to the one in South Side. I was horribly disappointed. Not only was the atmosphere a little different, the food wasn't as good as I had remembered. 
I'm willing to pay a pretty penny for a nice meal but this was way overpriced for what they were serving you. The portion sizes at South Side weren't as generous either. 

This place is a quintessential American restaurant so don't expect anything \"exotic\" or unique. You can pretty much get their food at a diner for half the cost.

There is one redeeming quality for the Cheesecake Factory - the cheesecake. Everything else on the menu you can skip, but if you want to lull yourself in a sugar coma the cheesecake here is your calling. While it is still overpriced for their cheesecake, splurging every once in a while didn't kill me."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waiting for over an hour for our food. We asked for the manager and never came to our table. Never will I eat here again. Food is good but having to wait for an hour with a hungry child is ridiculous. This was supposed to be a celebration for my sons 20th Birthday."}
{"text":"Great location.  We came after finding out that we cound't get a seat at the buffet due to long line.  The staffs were super helpful with getting us a table line up.  There is a huge aquarium right outside of the restaurant to keep the kids entertained.  Our waitress was kind and patient.  Food never disappoint.  Overall a very happy dining experience."}
{"text":"I've found most entrees here to be mediocre, but the avocado egg rolls and Craig's crazy carrot cheesecake are fantastic. You can get your weekly load of fat grams from these 2 items alone but maybe worth it."}
{"text":"Sitting here 45 minutes waiting on a burger and a beef sandwich for my wife. So glad was not really hungry. Food well prepared but getting it is the biggest joke. Plenty of wait staff. Then to hear dishes and glasses crashing to the ground not once but twice. Makes one wonder \"why did I come here\"? So think for service and timely food it needs only 2 stars."}
{"text":"A few adjustments and I will gladly give you 5 stars. 

I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls. They were good, but overcooked. They should have been fried 1-2 minutes less. They were beyond golden brown. (Based on the orders that were served to the people sitting next to us I think ya'll had a problem in the kitchen).

Greek salad, Hibachi Steak and Chicken Madeira were all excellent!!!

Before ordering dessert, I was joking with our server, Chris that I wish I could get half slices of the Celebration and the Cold Press coffee. After my first bite of the Celebration Cheesecake I wish I had ordered something else.  The only thing I tasted in the Celebration Cheesecake was imitation strawberry flavoring that left an artificial strawberry taste in my mouth. 

 That was a real disappointment. For the price of CCF cheesecake you expect it to be made with 100% natural flavors. 

So, a few minor adjustments and 5 stars you will receive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this location for our valentines dinner. I got the shrimp tomato, basil pasta ($18) and he got a kobe beef burger. Our waitress was great, but my pasta was not as great. When I received my pasta, there was an overwhelming amount of diced tomatoes and barely any pasta. The pasta tasted watery which affected the whole taste of my dish and there were only two pieces of shrimp. I feel like I wasted $43 for food that I could have made at home... this was a very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was my first time to go to a Cheesecake Factory. Don't know what I was waiting on. If all of them are as good as the one in Caesars Palace, then I've got a standby in every Metropolitan city in the country. This place is good.

The menu is gigantic, bordering on overwhelming. Most of the food was outstanding. My Salsbury steak was deluged with sage (not my favorite spice). That was about my only knock on the food. If only I had oredred one of the other 1400 items on the menu.

The service was nice and attentive. They gave me extra stuffed mushrooms because my first order, they said, had 5 instead of the prescribed 6. Nice touch! I would have never known what the correct number of mushrooms were. 

The setting was cavernous but it worked.

Smiley face and half a star."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to the Cheesecake Factory and again it's again a delightful place to eat.
Yes the environment alone is enticing with its beautiful architecture paintings and art deco design.

Eminem cover some 23 pages and it is hard to decide what to eat because everything is seems so delicious.

Joelle is an excellent server with a straight forward no BS style, perfect personslity.

Whoever created this concept of dieting did a marvelous job."}
{"text":"I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, but I got a gift card and some coupons over the holidays. I went with a couple friends, my treat. We didn't remember too much about Cheesecake Factory beforehand, just that there were some die hard fans so we thought it must be good right?! Wrong. 
We sat down and started to read a way too extensive menu with really expensive prices. We ordered two appetizers, the spinach dip and the garlic parmesan bread which already brought us to $21. We attempted to order flavored lemonades, but our over enthusiastic waiter ran away before we could finish and brought us normal lemonade. We ordered our meals which did come promptly and they were pretty good although extremely heavy. We finally got to order our $8 a slice cheesecakes which we enjoyed, but immediately felt very sick after taking a few bites. Our bill was ridiculously expensive and we all left feeling so full and overstuffed from the insanely big portions."}
{"text":"My ex worked at the cheesecake factory years ago and he-being a cook-was able to bring home a free menu item (or cheesecake) every night he worked. My favorite things for him to bring home were: the spicy chipotle chicken pasta,the Louisiana chicken pasta,the chicken madeira, and the godiva chocolate cheesecake. The spicy chipotle chicken pasta is honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce(this is what my mother always orders when dining here). The Louisiana chicken pasta is Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce. The chicken madeira is Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes. The godiva cheesecake is Layers of Flourless Godiva Chocolate Cake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse. It also comes with a godiva square. It always crowded and honestly there are better restaurants to eat at in the south side then this chain but it sure was nice being able to eat this food for free regularly!"}
{"text":"Their happy hour is the best in town! The  drinks and food are exceptionally good. The price is very good! You can be expensive for food but for happy hour it's wonderful. Try it out."}
{"text":"I feel like Cheesecake Factory is always a good choice. My boyfriend & I came here after shopping one night.. SUCH A GOOD CHOICE. I got the Jamaican Shrimp & he got the Jambalaya. Both were so delicious. The bread was delish as were the meals & drinks. I only wish you could get refills in meals. So good & recommended. Our server was great & the service great."}
{"text":"Im honestly surprised to see even a single bad review for this restaurant. I was super impressed with the overall operation of this place. 
This is my first visit to any cheesecake factory, and it was an excellent experience.
I feel i should mention, i was there to have dinner with my wife and daughter, and i had no time restrictions. I wasnt in a hurry. I wasnt looking at the clock. I also wasnt worried about the cost. It seems petty, to me,to worry about dollars and cents when spending time with people you like. So my experience is based solely on what happened, and no outlying factors.
We were seated promptly, and greeted by a friendly, nice looking server( i wanna say her name was rachel?, but like i said, i was here for family time) all of the staff appear clean, in clean uniforms, and nice looking. Drink orders, warm bread , blah, blah ,blah. Waitress was super patient when we werent ready to order, she seemed relaxed, and not at all hurried, even though the dining room is ENORMOUS. So we ordered. shrimp with angel hair and asparagus for me, chicken somethin for my wife, and plain burger for my kid. It was all good. Asparagus was perfectly cooked, uniform in color, crisp, but chewable. Pasta was 'al dente', which is exeptionally difficult to acheive in a commercial restaurant. 
Now, i honestly couldnt tell you how long the food took, or how long we were there, or what the servers attitude was like, because I WASNT LOOKING for those things. In my opinion, if your in a hurry, or concerned with your funds, maybe a table service restaurant isnt your best choice.
In conclussion:
As a professional in the restaurant industry myself, i was extremely pleased with my experience here, and i will go so far as to say, \"cheesecake factory is pulling it off\"."}
{"text":"Came here on a date with the wife the other day. It's impossible to not find something I will like at the Cheesecake Factory. The skinny menu is great when I'm dieting, and the low carb cheesecake was a great cheat - I am a big fan of the burgers for when I inevitably fail on my diet. The highlight of the most recent meal was our server Joe C, he was hilarious and offered great service - if you read any of my restaurant reviews, I pretty much judge a restaurants service based on whether I see the bottom of my soda glass, and joe kept me very hydrated"}
{"text":"Even almost a year after first opening in Toronto, this place still has a crazy long lineup! (Or maybe it was because we came during a weekday on March break...)

We started off with a buffalo chicken appetizer. This dish was... interesting and not what I expected. It was chopped chicken tossed in buffalo sauce, which was then covered in a deep fried flour shell. Tad bit too salty, but still an okay junk food appetizer.

I ordered the Steak Medallions for lunch - this was a huge disappointment. Teensy tiny pieces of steak so it really didn't even make a difference telling the waiter how you done you wanted your meat - still ended up being extremely dry and overcooked. 
My friends ordered the pasta and those looked much better than my steak dish! They offer a huge variety of pastas for their lunch menu.  

Of all the cheesecakes we tried, I liked the Celebration (rainbow-looking one) & the Godiva chocolate cheesecakes the most! The Celebration had the most cheese flavour and the Godiva was just fillllled with chocolatey goodness. If you aren't a huge sweet tooth and chocolate fan, perhaps skip the Godiva cheesecake because it is extremely sweet! Definitely share the cheesecake with someone else though, probably too sweet to eat on your own.

Service here is ridiculously slow. The servers are all extremely nice and all. But, oh my goodness... our meal from being seated to getting the bill took about 2 hours. The food took long to come out, it took forever to get our cheesecakes, and even the bill took forever to come out. Make sure you aren't in a time crunch when dining here. 

Come here for the cheesecake and nothing more (well, maybe the pasta if the line isn't that long)."}
{"text":"I give The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars.  Yes it is a chain, but by far my favorite chain of all.  Their menu is huge and diverse and did I mention delicious?  Plus it's one of those places that I like to dine at when I'm not really sure what I am in the mood to eat.  We always have a good meal and good service.  It can be a very busy place so we plan our visits accordingly and try to avoid peak times.  This particular location has a great patio.  My kids always get excited when I say 'lets eat at the Cheesecake Factory!' Also, I am on a mission in life to try every kind of cheesecake.  Unfortunately I am only about a third there.  Fortunately that means I get to keep going back. :)"}
{"text":"The food was really good, even though it was a little pricey.. that was expected.. but our waitress was very inattentive. It took her about 5 minutes to greet our table which was fine because they were busy. We ordered our drinks and our food, and when she brought our drinks we noticed she didn't bring a straw with one of the drinks... it took us almost 15 minutes to get her attention for a straw. Since they were so busy our food was taking a while, which again was fine were pretty understanding but the manager came out to apologize for the wait and said it would be out shortly. After about 45 minutes someone eventually ran our food out for our waitress.. our waitress only came back to bring us the straw, she  never came back to ask if the food was okay or if we needed refills or anything. When we were done she was quick to box it for us and got our cheesecake to go but that was pretty much the only time we saw her our whole visit. She didn't even tell us her name. The waitress at the table behind us seemed amazing, I wish we got her. I've only been to the lyndhurst location, and my family has never been to Cheesecake Factory at all so this was a first time for all at this one.. We will go to lyndhurst next time"}
{"text":"They rush you when you dine-in, they don't pick up when you call and the customer service from the girl doing take-out's is ridiculous.
I'd rather drive to buffalo for Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I go here for one thing. The Shrimp Scampi. I've loved it for years. It always stays the same. It's a plate of lovely angel hair pasta, that's garlicy, lemony, basily goodness. And the shrimp is huge. Some people don't like it but I love it- it's comfort food to me.

Other than the Shrimp Scampi I don't think I'd go to Cheesecake Factory. That's the reason for the three stars. It is mass chain, so nothing is really special about it."}
{"text":"Poor service. One waiter for a group of 15!!! Ordered dinner 45 prior to getting everyone else order and I still didn't get my food. The server also got the checks mixed up. Charges that were not mine were on my check. He shouldn't have waited on our table without help. Food got cold before I got my ketchup for my fries, so I ended eating them before they got cold. Reservation was at 6, we didn't get our food until 8. We didn't get out of the restaurant until 1030. What a mess of a biethday celebration it was. We made reservations and the service was still poor. Done!"}
{"text":"Food and service has been outstanding tonight! Came here for a family members birthday, and the staff came out and sang. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"As the name states, they serve a lot of cheesecake. We showed up for dessert at about 8pm on a Monday night, it was pretty empty and only a few tables. There was a nice glass case with all the different cheesecakes available, so it was nice to be able to see what were ordering before we actually ordered it. We shared a White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. The crust of the cheesecake was a black cookie crust and was very good. The cheesecake came with two large  mountains of whipped cream, probably way too much whipped cream any person should eat in one sitting. Regardless it was a chill atmosphere, and the dessert was good. The whole place has soft music playing but feels very loud and is hard to talk while in there, not sure if it was the 3 other tables of people or just the architectural design of the place producing a lot of echo/feedback. I knocked it down a few stars for the service. Server did not come around often (or at all), had to get her attention before she would come take our order and again to get our check. Our drinks were empty and didn't get refilled. Overall, good cheesecake, bad service. No comment on the food."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for about 2 years, with most of our visits in the last year.  The servers, while nice, are not always the brightest and not always the fastest, but they try hard and the food is good.  I was completely shocked today when I went in and asked for a patio table, as we had been allowed to have our two dogs with us (sitting outside of the patio) for several prior visits.  An older lady with a fake tan, a lot of make up, and a shorter blonde bob was completely rude about it and eventually pointed me in the direction of a manager, who was nicer but said only service dogs were allowed and, to my comment that we had been allowed there w/ our dogs many many times before, \"Well, I'll have to train my staff better.\"  It may seem like a small sticking point, but I will not be returning to this or any CCF in the future.  Arbitrary rules and rude employees are not my thing."}
{"text":"I first discovered the Cheesecake Factory when i was working in the LA area more than 20 years ago. This first visit left such a positive impression, i made it a point to visit this chain in several other cities over the years. I am not a huge fan of dining in chain restaurants, but i have made an exception in this case. The consistency and combination of high quality, freshness of food ingredients, very large menu selection and value for the money has made me a loyal fan. 

Since moving to the Phoenix metro area several years ago, i now visit the Chandler location almost exclusively. Although the Superstition Springs (Mesa) location is closer to home, my overall dining experience in Chandler has never been less than perfect. For me, it's been a sure thing!

The CKF is the type of place you can enjoy eating a meal alone, with friends or coworkers, with your spouse or significant other, or with family. Any day is a good reason to go. Why wait for a special occasion? Now that they offer curbside \"To Go\" service, you can pull up the menu online, phone in your order, drive over to the restaurant to the takeout parking spaces and call inside to let them know you are there waiting. The waitstaff delivers your food order to your car and accepts cash, debit, credit or CKF gift cards as payment. A perfect dining option for those times you are craving something from their menu but not in the mood to eat out. I have used this curbside service a few times on my way home from work when i didn't feel like cooking dinner.

The inside is spacious and nicely decorated. The outside patio has lots of elbow room and is a good option from late fall to early spring here in AZ. The menu is huge. Appetizers and drinks, healthy dining options, a main course meal or just dessert and a coffee beverage are some of the many choices available. The portion sizes are plenty large to share or take home leftovers for another meal.

I would have to guesstimate that over dozens of visits during the last several years, i have consumed 10's of thousands of calories. Do i regret that? Honestly, no. Each and every one of those calories has been well worth the enjoyment!

So many items to love. Some of my favorites include the Chicken Samosas, Roasted Pear and Bleu Cheese Flatbread, Chinese Chicken Salad, Factory Chopped Salad, Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta, Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken, Chicken Madeira, Peach Mint Julep, and the different Signature Lemonades, Of the cheesecakes my favorites are the Dutch Apple, the Salted Caramel, the White Chocolate Raspberry and the Lemon Meringue. My most favorite menu item is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp! It's a struggle with myself every time  go there to convince myself to order other things on the menu. 

i have never had less than perfect food, attentive, friendly and experienced wait staff, and an overall wonderful dining experience. Considering the food portions are quite large and the quality of the food is consistently fresh and delicious, the value is great"}
{"text":"Good food, but the table next to me had a small \"service\" dog that was on the table, in the person's lap, on the ground running around, then back on the table....  the server and manager did nothing.  This was a lap dog, with a service best you can buy on eBay...  not a seeing eye dog....  the people sitting on the opposite side even asked if the doug had any special training they said no.   Then they was another dog running around the bar.  Unsanitary, I won't be back into the management places sanitary conditions over running a indoor dog park."}
{"text":"I don't have much to offer that hasn't already been said - long wait, super busy, packed to the rafters chain restaurant.  I became very cozy with my neighbors children on our most recent visit.
I did however have my best meal ever at TCF, Hibachi Steak. Totally random item I have never seen anyone mention,  but it was amazing. Our waitress warned me it was \"spicy\", which it wasn't,  it could have used more spice in my opinion.  But she said that abput our appetizer and warned me my lemon raspberry cheesecake was very tart.  We clearly have different taste buds.

I just wish it wasn't so over priced, so over seated and so loud."}
{"text":"Update: The manager of this location contacted me and made the situation \"right\". We have since returned and had a great experience. They clearly value customer service at this location  and I conclude our previous experience was not typical. Thank you for a job well done! I will come again."}
{"text":"Jasmine was our server and she is awesome! We were a party of 8 and she was quick to take our drink and food orders. She is friendly and a great server! All of the food was delicious. This restaurant is clean and comfortable. Great atmosphere. We came to this location to be away from the strip but the restaurant was still busy. We waited about 45 minutes to get a table but there are places nearby to pass the time. It was worth the wait! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory. It's by far my favorite place to go, especially with the family since there is so much variety to choose from. I usually end up getting appetizers as meals every time I go. This time was no different except I added a cup of clam chowder to it. Oh man, that clam chowder was amazing. And filling! I could hardly finish my other food. I got nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes along with the mix of egg rolls (sorry, no picture). Avocado, Cuban, chicken southwest and the salmon one. In my opinion all tasted great except for the Cuban one, didn't care for the ham flavor in it. I just wasn't a big fan of it. Everything else, amazing. This place will always be a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"We went here while shopping in the mall. No wait for lunch. Food came out quickly. The prices are relatively close to our local CCF.  I would say about $2-$3 more each item. But love CCF , they never let us down."}
{"text":"I only come here for happy hour from 4-6. The happy hour deals are AMAZING the burger is $5.50 and cannot be beat.  The entire happy hour menu is great and you get a lot of food. 

Drink specials are reasonable."}
{"text":"It's really hard NOT to love Cheesecake Factory. This place has been an old favorite from years ago.
The food is usually consistent for the most part and the portions could feed a small  village. What fluctuates seems to be service. Tonight wasn't bad as we had a newbie who had some things to learn but very polite. Funny how I sometimes expect a certain level of service at established restaurants and forget that every server has to start somewhere.
After limiting myself to one slice of their signature warm brown bread, I feasted on the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. My fave! Large shrimp in a flavorful, Jamaican jerk-like sauce alongside white rice, fruity mango salsa, black beans and sweet plantains. I was a little piggy and ate all the succulent shrimp...because I could :) The sauce was plenty if you want to mix your rice into it.
The other item ordered at our table that I usually get was the Crusted Chicken Romano in a creamy white Alfredo sauce (not tomato as it shows on menu...get the white, it's better)
Served with pasta. Love how thin and crispy the chicken was in the Romano cheese crust. I recommend getting the sauce on the side or separating the chicken to keep it from getting soggy.
We also like the frozen mango raspberry smoothie that is just like taking a bite of fresh ripe mango. Very refreshing but will fill you up.
I don't recall having a bad meal here and the great part is there's something for everyone in your group and again portion sizes are big enough to share or take home for another meal."}
{"text":"Came here this morning for brunch with a couple of  friends and was thoroughly disappointed. Juliet was our waiter and took literally 20 minutes to even get our drink order in. Than came back 10 minutes later to take our food order. After placing our order in it took an hour....yes ONE HOUR to get our basic omelettes and chicken/waffles. 
I was shocked that the people around us had received their food before we had and they were seated WAY AFTER US. 
It's safe to say I will not be returning here based on poor customer service."}
{"text":"Well, I'll be blunt. The food is decent, and their charming array of different types of cheesecake is delicious. When friends and I go, we mostly go for the cheesecake--after all, that's what the place is named for. I have never had a bad cheesecake. I was once a little disappointed in a dish I got, but all the other times have been pretty pleasant. Customer service is pretty good. When it got buys we waited a really long time to get our check, but you can't really blame them for that."}
{"text":"As always in my reviews: if the service is not perfect - everything else is less important!
We come for dressers. Why hot chocolate orders needs to take 20 min? Especially when the regular coffee and the cake arrives right away? The cake and the hot chocolate was VERY good but I cannot give more than 3 stars due to my disappointment with the service"}
{"text":"To start off the macaroni balls were scrumptious! It all went down hill when I chose the chicken & biscuits, what in the world was I thinking. When the food arrived the smell already threw me off, then I poked at the biscuits and they were harder. They felt like they were made days ago. I continued to poke around and really enjoyed the mashed potatoes but the chicken. Let me tell you. It felt like it had been microwaved and had a really rubber texture to it. No word on when I will be back but definitely not going to recommend this entree."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday afternoon around 3- was a 10 minute wait for a table of two. We had about 3 different servers because they were having a staff meeting and they were rotating the staff i guess. 
The menu is really big! Approx 20 different pages with a variety of items, most likely for everyone to find something they like. 
We started with the nachos, which were really well done to the point of burnt edges. We had to request a new one. By the time the new nachos arrived, so did our meals. The nachos were okay - the salsa was like more of a marinara sauce. 
I ordered the Louisiana pasta? I think it's called. It was good but my noodles were super al dente (maybe cause it was busy and they rushed). My friend had a pasta with bacon and peas - weird combo and it was suggested by the waiter. 
Cheese cake is 10 dollars a slice of all kinda but I guess that's what you go for.

And no- the nachos weren't excused from the bill fwhich I could careless , but many reviews have mentioned a guaranteed complementary meal)."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Our waitress Jennifer was very helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is great. The food... Phenomenal. Me and my friend could not finish it all. They need recliners in this place for situations like this! The meatloaf was wonderful. It came with brown gravy which I normally don't like on my meatloaf but this brown gravy wasn't your normal everyday gravy. It was in a class by itself. My friend's food tasted great as well. Yeah I ate some of her food. Don't judge me. Lol. The flavor her dish had was spectacular! I will order that the next time. Now we're full and need to walk it off. Heading into the mall for a little shopping. Until next time my fellow Yelpers... Peace and chicken grease..."}
{"text":"I have been to numerous places and had different quality service.  My server, Adrianha, at Cheesecake Factory was among the best.  She is very attentive and friendly and was very patient with my table as it took us a while to order since we were catching up.

I ordered on the light side and had a Fresh Kale Salad and Lettuce Wraps which were both really good.  Each plate had just the right amount of crunch and tasted fresh.  I highly recommend Cheesecake Factory at SouthPark."}
{"text":"You can not go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory!!  They have the largest menu of any restaurant I've ever seen.  Great meals and usually quite large.  I love the Thai Lettuce Wraps and the Orange Chicken entree.  Also the Red Velvet Cheesecake is out of this world!!"}
{"text":"I can appreciate the Cheesecake Factory every now and then, but I'm on the fence.  The whole chain aspect and shear size of the restaurant makes it very cookie-cutter and forgettable.  Sure the space is pretty grand and offers a nice atmosphere, but the menu is gigantic and it's almost dizzying how they make you wait, rush you in, and then you can't even remember what you ate....

Yes they do make good cheesecake and it's a treat... it's also very filling... most of their portion sizes seem like they are trying to feed 2 or 3 people with each plate.

This could have been a fluke because they are always so busy, but last time I came in I just wanted to get a gift card and the hostess was very rude and told me to get them from the cashier [ with a tone that I should have known that in the first place ].  I'll let it roll off for now, but I would hire people that have more patience to be at the front of the house."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have had at Cheesecake Factory. I have been several times and LOVED it. This time we got the appetizers after 30 minutes and then only got 2/3 of them and then they served the first dinners with the 3rd appetizer. We had to ask the waitress 3 times for our bottles of water before we got it. The manager came out and apologized for the appetizer coming out so late, and that's fine, of course no problem, that stuff happens. But then the waitress had to be asked three times for the water and we never got out coffee with our cheesecake (which of course was awesome!). I'm shocked at the service and quality. Hope it was just a one off incident or that will be the last time I go. Shame as its my favorite place to go in Charlotte when I come home."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE:
Where do I even start. Firstly, they attempted to seat us to a small table where if we were to have accepted we would have been sitting elbow to elbow to the person sharing the booth seat. No problem, and a quick fix. They quickly sat us at a booth, which was nice and we appreciated that accommodation. 5 minutes later our server D shows up to take our drink order, she grabs our drinks quickly, sets them down, and rushes away. We had in mind an appetizer we wanted to order and that would have been a great time to order however she didn't stop at the table for even a second for us to do that. Another 5-7 minutes later she shows up once more and asks us if we are set to order. As we order she seems rushed, and quickly leaves our table once again. After our appetizer gets to the table brought by I assume a runner she never once came by to ask if we need anything. Here and there she would grab our drinks to refill without asking and wouldn't say a word, never spending even a second at the table to give us a chance to ask for anything. Once our food arrived the runner put our food down and ran off before asking if we needed anything else before I could process that I had blue cheese, and not ranch on my plate. I was expecting our server to show up and ask us how everything was, or to ask if we need anything else but no nothing. Since we were seated near a server station my husband waved down another server who was standing around conversing with another server. She fingered hold on to my husband and finished her conversation. She finally came over and asked my husband if he needed something and when he said we needed a side of ranch, and buffalo sauce she ran off to get it. Another server (still not ours) brought the ranch, and said she'd be back with the buffalo sauce. 2 minutes later, the buffalo sauce finally arrived. After our meals were almost done another server saw that our drinks were low, and offered to refill them. Once completely finished, our server finally arrived and asked about dessert. The check arrived with our to go desserts because we couldn't stand to be in there any longer. Long story short, the service was terrible. My two stars are only for the food, that was better than the service."}
{"text":"The west side of Madison.  For this denizen of the Isthmus, that phrase conjures the idea of the apex of a normative soulless mainstream culture, where corporate restaurant franchises dictate protocol with the same pathological assurance as certain politicians.  Enter the edifice of the Cheesecake Factory, whose menu is mostly as calorically indulgent as the decor is bereft of any regional identification.  To cut to the chase, I had a small Greek salad bathed in some kind of lemon oil dressing with room temperature chicken.  I was happy to be back in familiar and comforting environs later that day."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is an incredibly safe bet. You can expect average food at an above average price, but there's definitely something on the menu for everyone, since they have basically every type of food. Not worth the hype in my opinion, but still decent food. I got the beets with goat cheese and got less food than expected for the price. The dish was okay but not great."}
{"text":"My first time in a Cheesecake Factory was last week, when we had our office holiday lunch there.  I was struck by how...well....HUGE the place was.  I felt like I was in Honey I Shrunk the Kids, if that movie took place in some kind of pseudo-Tuscan sculpture garden.  Seriously, the building is enormous, the ceilings are waaaaay up there, and the food....I felt dwarfed by that as well.

Our servers were super friendly, especially considering how challenging it can be to serve a party of twelve.  Everything came out quickly - surprisingly quickly - almost as if they predicted what we were going to order and had it waiting for us.  I'm assuming that isn't the case, and that all the food is just organized in such a way that any dish can be assembled in about 5 minutes.

I had some bites of various appetizers, including the Fried Calimari, the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, and the Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip (which is technically a \"small plate,\" not an appetizer).  I just realized how humorous it is that one of the dips is described as Hot, and the other as Warm.  They both tasted hot to me!  All the apps were okay - the dips were gooey (in a good way), the calimari was crispy.  Everything was a bit on the salty side, not surprisingly for a chain restaurant, but not unpleasantly so.  The Spinach dip was a little runny for my taste, but it tasted good!

For my entree, I got the Cuban sandwich.  It had all the classic ingredients: pork, ham, Swiss cheese, mustard, pickles.  It also had mayo on it, which I didn't really care for - I know they do that in some restaurants, but I don't really think of it as traditional. And they were pretty heavy-handed with it.  Other than that the sandwich was all right - again, pretty darn salty.  My boyfriend ate the other half later and he really enjoyed it.  I think in retrospect, I should've gone with a different choice.

For dessert, I had the Snickers cheesecake.  A good size slice, served unnecessarily with two huge scoops of whipped cream (seriously, what?  who needs all that?)  I really liked the cheesecake, but ended up taking half of it home, along with some of my coworker's pumpkin cheesecake which was also delicious.

the prices are affordable, the service is uber friendly, the cheesecake is tasty, and the food is pretty reliable.  I'm not big into chains so I don't think I'd be keen to return, especially since they do have a heavy hand with salt, and because the food here is, well, massively unhealthy.  I found the nutrition facts on another website and, well, it scared me.  I can see why some people would really like this place, since they have a huge variety of things and big portions. Nothing really wowed me, but it was a fine place to have a company lunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance 
Employees friendly
Food is good
Cheesecakes are wonderful 

I would definitely come back here

Hamburger was good
The salad had too much vinegar 

Another hamburger was good
Sweet potato fries according to my mother in law were great

I had the clam chowder and it was excellent 

The artichoke dip was okay
It had a little too many onions"}
{"text":"This place is 4.5 stars for me. I've been coming here for many years ever since they opened. This place is ALWAYS crowded during dinner time, if you come around 6-8 you will probably have to wait unless if you made a reservation, this is particularly true on the weekends. I have tried numerous appetizers, pasta entree, burger entree, and cheesecake desserts. Overall, the flavor of the food is great, the presentation is also commendable and the portion is very large. Because of the large portion, on some of their dishes they offer 1/2 sizes. The interior decoration is very nice, 2 floor high ceiling, golden deco, very spacious and many different sections. They have a full bar overlooking a great view. When you order pasta, they always bring out parmasan and shred it right in front of you. Love their pesto and sundries tomatoes. They also always bring put a basket of wheat and white bread after you order. Entrees range around 12-18 dollar. Appetizers around $8-12. Their appetizers are pretty big too, i ordered the avocado spring rolls once and i was able to eat it as an entree. The avocado spring rolls are amazing, i highly recommend them. They are different than any other spring rolls you've had. Perfect flavor and consistency over a crispy shell. If i remembered correctly, there are 6 large half pieces of spring rolls. The cheesecakes are around $6-8 per piece. Very large size served on a large plate, can be shared among 2-3 people. Drinks are around $7-12, pretty good as well, great mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Had a very lovely and memorable dinner with the rock of my life. Definitely one of our Go 2's for a nice relaxing dining experience. Meals are always prepared delightfully with lots of love and attention to detail. Always experienced a very hospitable atmosphere. Lights are dim candles burn low and the tastes and quality of our dishes absolutely always meet our standards for the occasions. Chipotle Chicken Pasta & Filet Mignon are stupendously appetizing. Avocado egg rolls are always a pleasant choice for a appetizer. Lemon Drop Martinis accommodates the romance in the air. I highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park if you're looking for a low key but slightly romantic and relaxing evening. Definitely always a win."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Front desk wasn't pleasant at all, understand it's busy but it's your job to take care of customers. Very unorganized. Love Cheesecake Factory but I'll travel across town to another location."}
{"text":"i havent been to a cheesecake factory for a little over 7 years. it was a college staple for friends' birthdays, and i tried the sf location when i first moved to the city in 2010, and that was it. cut off. until i arrived in phoenix on sunday and thought this would be a fun option in the camelback area. walked in and sat at the bar, and the place didnt have a line out the door (UNUSUAL).  the bar area was pretty popular though, since there was sunday football and a few high tops were taken. i perused the drinks menu (never ordered those before at cheesecake!) and settled on an espresso martini - came out relatively quickly, and it was delicious! i would have one more before leaving... my go-to at cheesecake is the bang bang chicken and shrimp dish served with rice and with toasted coconut on top. so naturally i ordered that and a side of roasted brocoli (which tasted really healthy and i was grateful for that!) the dish was certainly a lot better in college, but it brought me back! the coconut curry is still pretty delicious, and i still wish that they gave you more sauce for the amount of rice. but other than that, i cant complain. had leftovers for lunch the following day :) service was nice and quick. i would come back i think if i were on the road again!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great food, really clean, and really awesome. You may have to wait but it's worth it. And I'm only talking about the food! Now let me talk about the cheesecake. ITS THE BEST. I recommend the Oreo cheesecake and all the other cheesecakes. Also there's a location on the strip if your staying there!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! First it's mostly only a 5 minute wait because the restaurant is huge Second service is great. Also, the restraint is clean and the food is great. Plus if you get a view outside you'll get a view of the show or the huge aquarium."}
{"text":"I'd first like to preface my review by saying that I prefer to eat at non-chain restaurants too. 

But of the chains, I have a special fondness for the Cheesecake Factory. Back at my old job in Virginia I would take clients out to lunch quite often, and where did they always want to go? The Cheesecake Factory. Have gone there so much, I really got to try a variety of different dishes, from the salads, to the pastas, to the steaks, salmon, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I tend to order the louisiana chicken pasta or a steak. Or one of their great salads if it's lunch time. 

I was never a fan of restaurants with such an extensive menu, but Cheesecake does a good job. I cannot recall ordering anything that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I can't recall ordering a dish and thinking that it was my favorite ever, but Cheesecake is pretty consistent. And their portions are large so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. That's why I think it's always busy on Weekends for lunch and dinner. There really is a lot to choose from, which is good when you have a group of people that can't decide on cuisine that night. 

The service isn't bad. I think that people in general need to understand that when a restaurant is super busy sometimes the level of service dips a little bit. And not all server is created equal. In every restaurant there are servers who move more efficiently, make few mistakes, and...well...for a lack of a more eloquent way to put it...are just better than others. And unless you're a regular you probably won't know who's who. Having waited tables in the past I probably tend to have more patience with service. That being said I've had great service on weekends and off-peak hours here than I did on the weekend dinners that were had here. coincidence? I doubt it. 

Not much needs to be said about the cheesecake. It's always terrific. 

You know what to expect with the cheesecake factory... huge menu, diverse selection, decent service, great cheesecake."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few time.  Service has always been great. Food is just right and the red velvet cheese cake is irresistible. Will always return to this location when visiting las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent tonight at the cheesecake factory.  Stephanie was excellent over-the-top very attentive to our refills on our sodas.  She would come back every five minutes to check on us.  I love the chicken tacos on the skinny menu"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak diane and shrimp scampi followed by Tiramisu cheesecake for desert. My friends told me that it is not as good as other cheesecake factory but I think they are just as good. Maybe don't go there during rush hours because it still takes 40 minutes to get a table at 1:40. Otherwise, delicious?"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, that is not the reason for 3 stars. I am a bit of a service snob after working in the service industry for 10 years. With that said, we waited entirely too long in between courses with items getting left behind. I ordered a soup for dinner and mine was last to come out after people got steak. Then we had one person order dessert, when the dessert came rhe waiter came back and asked if we wanted anymore dessert. We said no again and waited another 10 minutes for him to bring the check. This is not only horrible for a guest whose dinner normally would take no longer than an hour but for the business as their turn over time is much higher allowing less opportunity for guests to come in. Longer wait times both at the table and in line equals less return customers. Overall the food was great and the Georgia peach beverage was refreshing."}
{"text":"3 words: Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.

So much yum!!!

Always great and professional service when we go here!!! Also, the complimentary bread is delicious. It's a bit pricey, but you're paying for the atmosphere, great service, and gourmet experience. Love coming here for special occasions!"}
{"text":"The building and decor are great. There's something almost grand about it. Many of the tables have wicker arm chairs which I'm not a fan of. They aren't exactly uncomfortable, but at 6'3\", 250 lbs, let's just say I prefer to be a little less restricted. Most of the food is great and the menu is extensive. If you can't find something you're in the mood for, it must not exist. My wife jokingly refers to the menu as the bible; She'll say, \"turn to the book of desserts\". It may be a joke, but it's not far off from the truth. The menu has everything from pizza and pastas, burgers and sandwiches, steak and chicken, breakfasts, brunches, even a section called \"power foods\" with things like kale and quinoa salads. Even the dessert menu takes up 2 or 3 pages. Suffice it to say, if you've got a group with diverse tastes, The Cheesecake Factory is a safe bet to please everyone."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have chose to eat here as we prefer to stay away from corporate but this is where Grandma wanted to go - and who can deny Grandma? =)  We got here around 4:30p on a Friday and the place was empty.  Our server quickly greeted us and took our drink order.  I was so overwhelmed with the menu, and I noticed there were duplicates between the regular menu and the specialty menus which didn't help.  I'm a big fan of small menus that you do really well versus the large menu that you do mediocre.  All four of us ordered something different, tho, and it was all amazing.  The bread that came before the menu was tasty too - with a few different options. I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp with brown rice and my fiance got the jambalaya.  He somehow managed to finish most of his while I ended up taking 3/4 of mine home.  It was just as good leftover and it fed both of us lunch the next day. 

All four of us also took a piece of cheesecake home.  I hope that no one eats the entire piece in one sitting....it took me 4 different times to finish it (which is JUST fine).  

I always hear how big their portion sizes are and how terrible (for you) the food is.  I don't feel like this is a place to come if you're watching what you eat, plain and simple.  If you're on a diet, just stay away.  This place is a treat, not a regular eating spot.  Their \"skinnylicious\" menu is a joke - don't let the clever words fool you.  Pot pie should never be on a \"skinny\" menu!

Our server was decent - nothing fantastic - but he did his job.  The place was immaculately clean, well decorated and a bit on the noisy side.  We will likely take a piece of cheesecake to go but doubt we'll ever return for a meal."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory and I am a fan! We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and it was pretty good. The bread that they brought out was I think dipped in a whole vat of butter, the complementary bread they brought out was actually better with the dip. For the main dish i got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and it was awesome. The flavor and the crispy topping brought everything together. The veggies and the chicken were plentiful and covered in the sauce. I brought it home because i couldn't finish it all and it was just as good reheated. The wait staff was very polite and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Super excited we have Cheesecake Factory in Toronto! The line up was insane (1hr to get a buzzer, then another 3hr wait around the mall) but nonetheless my friends and I were excited when it was finally our turn! Quality of the food is just like when I had it in buffalo. Menu has lots of selection, portions are huge. The fried Mac and cheese is really good for appetizer. Most of us ordered pasta and while it tasted great, it is more on the salty side. The highlight was definitely the cheesecakes at the end of the meal. Our table ordered the red velvet, Godiva, banana pudding, anniversary and tiramisu cheesecakes. Of them all the red velvet was my favourite - it was really light and not too sweet! Tiramisu and Godiva were my second favourite. Will definitely go back but will skip the line and get the cheesecakes to go!"}
{"text":"If you like to make sure there's something for everyone, you'll love the Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is practically the size of a small encyclopedia! Sooooooo many selections, everything is tasty and the portion sizes are ginormous. I usually order the crusted romano chicken w/pasta and made to order red sauce,  eat about 1/3 of it then pack up the rest for home so I have room for the banana cream pie cheesecake -- PHENOMENAL! The service is great, and the atmosphere is your typical CF- high ceilings, beautiful paintings, over-the-top lighting and marble table tops. Be prepared for a wait if you go on the weekend. We usually have one of our party go put in our name, while the rest of us do a little shopping :)"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake is to die for!  Of course---very yummy!  The rest of the food was pretty good too.  

Hostess, Bartender and Server not so much!  I get that this is a busy restaurant and the Host/Hostess are met everyday probably with giving people long wait times, but being pleasant goes a long way. When you immediately start fidgeting with your computer screen punching in buttons with a stressed frown on your face, thankful our parents who have never been to Cheesecake Factory didn't have to endure this rude greeting.  Next, it's on to the bar for a couple glasses of wine and a virgin daquiri (we told the bartender before we ordered we would make it worth his while :)  -- expected that to get a little friendly response.  No instead an abrupt stomp off to make it.  Comes back we ask for a wine list and bartender seems annoyed we are not ordering food.  Ask about the house chardonnay and he tells me it\"s compared to Beringer--blick!  That's a first!  So we get our wine and settle up immediately, we were going to hang out, but we felt very unwelcome here.  Decide to sit outside for the rest of our wait, the seating outside is really nice and it was a nice night.  Finally, the buzzer rings and it's on to dinner.  Waiter is pleasant enough but, seems frazzled and not overly friendly.  Takes our drink orders, brings them back with bread basket.  Takes our order and app order.   App comes out, probably good time to make sure everyone has drinks still... nope.  He disappears then, apparently at this restaurant there are no food runners so, the waiter is also responsible for getting your food out to you too.  Seems like a BIG mistake to me--unless your organized and a good waiter/waitress.   We were a party of 6 and like I said first time our parents had ever been here and we were hoping to treat them to a good evening.  So half of our party got our food right away, the other half waited and waited (typically at most restaurants when food comes out seperate like that it is expected that the rest of the tables food is coming up right?).  We saw our waiter take another order, before he got the rest of our food.  No checkback really, and definitely no drink refills, unless  you count the time I flagged him down.  When our waiter finally came back to the table, ingredients from my salad were missing, had to get waiter to go ask for those items.  

Like I said food was good enough and cheesecake was awesome, but for what you pay to eat at this place and the wait, you expect better service!  There are a ton of great restaurants in our area and for us this is not one we will be in a hurry to return to.  Best part, we also get the impression that the people who work there don't really care if you come back!"}
{"text":"I love there food So good and delicious. Also clean and organize And you don't have to wait long time tell you get the food so happy So happy that I visit  this place ."}
{"text":"As common as the Cheesecake Factory is.. I mean every outdoor mall or shopping \"town center\"... but anyway, I try to avoid mega-chains like this, but honestly, it's super good. Get past the fake Italian rustic wallpaper and you've got page after page of menu items to choose from. Their salads are unique and packed with stuff - my mom, sister and I went out to lunch together and each got a different salad, all three satisfying. Cheesecake aside, they actually do a good job with their restaurant food."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times before this last time. On August of 2011 I went to Cheesecake Factory with my family for my mother birthday (10) people. I understand that this place does get busy and there was going to be a wait. So they told us it'll be a hour wait which we were fine with. An hour past we still waited 2 hours are creeping by so we ask if our table was ready, no not yet. Still waiting and now 5 kids are getting inpatient and crying they are hungry. Now Im getting upset and whats taking so long to get a table. It seem as if they didn't care I had to ask for a manager to get anything done. The manager did try to make the situation better by comp some food but the damage was done for a 2 hrs and so wait. I with to order a cheesecake for my mother and some man that work there made a comment that I had to pay for that. I just brush it off and reply I know that. I will never return to this or any cheesecake factory. The service was bad and made to feel as dirt."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch here after an afternoon of shopping around the Forum Shops. Though it was a Sunday afternoon they weren't ridiculously packed. We were seated quickly and were greeted by a very friendly wait staff. Our waitress was super nice and attentive. She was quick to bring by anything we asked for and was very helpful with helping us decide what we wanted to order. I wish they had a restroom on the first floor, but unfortunately you have to take the elevator all the way up to the second floor if you happen to be seated on the first and need to go. Other than that, the food and service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Bartender service is supposed to be fast and attentive.  At the bar and he decided to read the paper instead of pay attention to anyone. Blah."}
{"text":"Great food great drinks but food took a little longer than normal, but we got a free cheesecake Manager very nice, came to our table and offer a free desert...."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. I ordered the Herb Encrusted Salmon and it was quite delicious. However, herb encrusted salmon does not taste quite as good when you're throwing it up. Currently sitting in the doctors office waiting for meds over a bad case of food poisoning. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Sadly, The Cheesecake Factory on the westside in Las Vegas has never truly measured up to the brand. You're always better off visiting The Strip. There are too many eateries in the area to take any chances at this location.

The Cheesecake Factory on the westside has a reputation for a 50-50 split between enjoying the meal or feeling sick. During our last visit, sick meant food poisoning.

After eating the lightest meal at this location -- fish and chips -- the next week resulted in one of the worst bouts of food poisoning ever. I should have known. The fish tasted frozen and as if it had been left under the heat lamp too long. It should have went back, but after a long road trip, no on had the energy to wait around. 

Afterward, the incident was reported. The company claimed to do an investigation, said they could find no evidence that could trace the sickness back to the restaurant, and promptly sent the absolute last thing anyone in my family wanted to see -- a gift certificate to go back. No thank you, ever.

There is nothing wrong with The Cheesecake Factory, but there is with this one. Avoid."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon combo with shrimp scampi for 22 dollars. This has got to be the smallest piece of salmon I've ever received"}
{"text":"We went twice in 2 days for half off cheesecake for National Cheesecake Day.  They were located on Rampart Blvd in the Boca Park shopping center in Las Vegas.

The first day was with a Facebook email.  The second day was with no coupon.  We tried the Dulce de Leche, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, Key Lime, and Kahlua® Cocoa Coffee Cheesecakes.  We took an Original cheesecake and a Red Velvet cake home.  i liked those two the best and would order them again."}
{"text":"The food is so UNDERWHELMING and service so slow that could  not justify 1 hour wait in the line. Pretty overrated!"}
{"text":"A great classic American fusion style of food! My boyfriend and I go here all the time and always have great, fast service and food! I love their pastas and appetizers and my boyfriend loves their steaks! So far never had a bad experience at this location. The food prices are fair and decent portioned, clean restrooms is a plus! 

When coming on the weekends though, make sure to come 30 minutes-1 hour earlier than when you normally eat because this place is hopping with people and the wait can be taxing to those who are impatient. 

Try the Avocado Spring Rolls! (Make sure to ask for two sauces not one, it's super delicious!)"}
{"text":"Generally when you go to chain restaurants, you expect the same delivery in taste and experience on the whole. Unfortunately this location did not.

My boyfriend and I went after a lovely show at the Smith Center and it let out about 10pm. We wanted to go eat somewhere nice and conveniently close. As we love our Cheesecake Factory at Green Valley Ranch, we decided to try this location based on our great experiences with the other locations.

Great factor was that it was open till 12am but downside is that even though there were not so many people on a Friday night, the service was very slow. We usually get our favorites, Avocado Spring Rolls, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Rib Eye Steak. 

The Spring rolls were delicious as is the sauce which is easily devoured! But the Bistro Shrimp pasta was really spicy! Now this is supposed to be a general garlic and wine sauce with no spicyiness at all. It had way too much red chili peppers! My mouth was on fire! 

The steak was burned but my boyfriend ate it anyways since he was hungry.

When the server asked about the meals I let him know of the issues but all we got was a 'Sorry' (It wasn't his fault for the food though) and only 5% off the bill.

If you want the traditional Cheesecake Factory yumminess, don't go to this location as it lacks the quality and taste."}
{"text":"I ordered a meal from the Cheesecake Factory last night to be delivered by the Door Dash app.  I received my dinner and not my cheesecake.  I'm pretty sure 99% of America eats at this restaurant because they plan on finishing their meal with cheesecake.  I called the Cheesecake Factory to find out what happened. I was transferred to two different people, put on hold, and finally the manager answered and put me on hold then hung up on me."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner with family or friends.  Staff were friendly.  Food was delish. They come in big portions and the ambience was great.  The only thing I don't like about the place is the lighting.  It's too dim and a bit loud.  Pam, our waitress, was very friendly and checked on us frequently.  Will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Great! Everything you would expect! We had our main and didn't have enough room for desert!"}
{"text":"We had such a great experience here. We were seated in a comfortable booth near a window to look out of. Ambiance was very nice and food was very delicious. I highly recommend the peach smoothie! It was so tasty and refreshing. What made our dining experience special was the amazing service. Chris Newman was our server and he was able to recommend us items from the menu, made sure we always had everything we needed, and overall had a warm energy about him. Overall great experience at this location!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Cheesecake factory dining experiences in the U.S as it has become such a tradition whenever we are visiting. As such, super excited they finally opened up shop here at Yorkdale! Came on a Wednesday night around 5:30pm and honestly, lines are still crazy. We waiting in the mall line for 20 mins and then another 2 hours almost for the pager to ring. Knowing how busy the restaurant, I had expected a wait but I did not appreciate the front desk hostess poor customer service. She was not very helpful at all and displayed poor attitude towards customers. When we were finally sat down, we also ended up getting a spot really close to the emergency exit which was super chilly. Honestly, this was about to be a 2-star review easily but the food was good and our waitress was a gem. My boyfriend ordered his favourite combo plate (madera chicken and steak) and I ordered myself the shrimp scampi. Both dishes were delicious. My complaint about my dish was that there wasn't a lot of angel hair pasta but a fair amount of shrimps. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake and it was delicious!!! It essentially taste like a ferrero rocher."}
{"text":"Had the crusted salmon with mash potato and asparagus lunch.  All can say is mmm mmm good. This is my first time at a cheesecake factory and wont be my last. Having good company and a good appetite makes a perfect lunch.  The choices on the menu makes it so very hard to decide.  I also have a couple of friends that tell me you can not go wrong with anything on this menu. I would love to come back again maybe on a special occasion because it is special occasion kind of money you will spend. You do get complimentary bread and that is a plus because its not bad at all. I like the wheat one it seemed to be softer than the white.  I did not get the cheesecake maybe next visit."}
{"text":"This review is based on getting take out cheesecake from here since my husband and I were too full to dine in. We also didn't have time anyway to wait in the line up, though it was shorter (15 people) than the usual hundreds in line from what I've heard. We came here on a Monday (late afternoon) and it took only a few minutes to order the cheesecake slices that we wanted, which was great. It actually took us longer to decide what we wanted to get than the actual ordering process. We ordered the red velvet, coffee chocolate and Oreo dream cheesecake slices, which came out to about $30 in total. It was puzzling to be told that it would be a 40 minutes wait to get three slices of cheesecake though, considering that the cheesecake slices in the display were already sliced up. Anyway, we walked around Yorkdale in the meantime and came back to get the slices, which were waiting on the counter along with the other orders. We ate the cheesecake slices over the course of the week and all were delicious, though a bit smaller than what I remember from several visits to the U.S. locations in past years. I wish that the prices were a bit lower and the portions were larger but that being said, we'll still probably be back to brave the crowds to dine in at some point in the next few months."}
{"text":"Arrghhh, I hit a key accidentally and my almost-complete review disappeared!  To re-create:

It was senile dementia that brought us to the Cheesecake Factory.  Let me explain: Friends were visiting from CA, and after we sat around drinking wine and munching on cheese and crackers, we turned to the serious problem of where to go for dinner.  The couple has been to Vegas often, but mostly in the SW valley, where their son lives.  Herb came up with the brilliant suggestion to go to Mixx, and I readily agreed, thinking it would be something different for them.

We were presented with menus and water, and as I was explaining the bowl concept to them, I suddenly had a Duh! moment, and realized that the very next night we were going to meet a group of neighbors for Happy Hour in this very restaurant.  We had already decided that at HH we'd order two Fresh Market big bowls instead of the HH apps, so that we could take home leftovers, my favorite meal.  But we didn't remember any of that when we set out for Mixx.  We certainly weren't going to do that two nights in a row.  So, completely chagrined, we told the waitress we'd see her tomorrow night.  Cheesecake Factory, being right next door, was the obvious substitute, since we didn't want to start thinking all over again.

All four of us ordered from the Skinnylicious menu, probably in atonement for the excesses of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's.  Our friend had the Flatbread with Pear and Blue Cheese, and loved it.  His wife had the Lettuce Wraps, picking the Asian \"tacos.\"  The dish looked beautiful, and she enjoyed it.

My husband ordered a Turkey and Avocado sandwich, which came on a bun with a bowl of salad, and he liked his, too.

And then there was me, deciding on the skinny version of the Turkey Burger. Wanting a change from buns, I chose the wheat baguette. And ranch on the side for my salad.  As soon as my fork touched the burger, it fell apart, but it tasted okay.  But that wheat baguette was no wheat baguette.  It was more like pumpernickel, and it was SWEET!  So were the caramelized onions - adding sugar is a sloppy shortcut for the slow cooking that renders them naturally sweet.  My salad didn't come with the ranch dressing I asked for.  Instead, it had the house dressing already on it.  Lots of it.  When the waiter brought a new salad and the ranch, that dressing turned out to be strangely sweet, too.  Sweet ranch??? Yuk, and yuk also for the salad, which was a sizable portion, but completely different from the one my husband got.  Not my kind of mix.

Service was impersonally okay, but just average.  Three of us four liked what we ordered.  I'm the outlier, but I'm the one writing the review, so I get to give it three stars.  And I'm being generous."}
{"text":"The food is good here but never try and call in a to-go order, you're just wasting your time on the phone. Tried to call ahead and was on hold for 17 minutes. Soon as I walked in the door the girl casually picks up the phone. I understand things can get busy but to be on hold almost 20 minutes and not have my order taken is unacceptable. This was on 2/12/17 around 2:30 pm."}
{"text":"Buenísimos platos. Recomendado el \"bistro shrimp pasta\", abundante y para compartir. 
Cheesecake para probar el de banana."}
{"text":"Any Cheescake on their menu, there is about thirty to choose from, is to die for! I actually can't remember the last time I came here to eat something that wasn't dessert. I find their menu to be to much. The portions on their entrees are huge though if you do eat dinner. I find their food good, but it's not really worth the trip or price. If you want a great cheesecake or any other dessert at a nice place don't hesitate to come here! Their patios are nice and cool at night as well!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory because it is consistent with other Cheesecake Factories.  Menu, bread, drinks are exactly the same.  The portions are large and the food is always good.  Pricing is decent.  They have curbside service which is nice for carryout (at this location).   

I read some of the other reviews and just like other popular restaurants especially cheesecake factory, you are going to have waits and sometimes you will have bad service.  

This was my first time at this location. I have been to Cheesecake Factories from DC to LA.  Service was initially slow considering it wasn't that crowded, but my food came quickly.  

They also validate 2 hours of parking."}
{"text":"Totally love the service, food and of course the desert. I've been lucky enough not wait long for my table like others but the young small, petite, women hostess was not very friendly/professional but the waiters are great. 
Recommend: Chicken Madera w/Stake platter.
Chicken pot stickers.
Calamari a must.
Red velvet for desert.
Sheerly temple...easy on the ice but other wise delicious! 

Note: kids pizza very delicious but too big for 1 child could be shared w/ 2nd child. 
 
Overall Food is always Perfect/ delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"I can't get over the snickers cheesecake, yum!!! My glass was never empty and the food was delicious! I always make it a point to stop by here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"1/12/10
I try not to visit chain restaurants as much as possible, but when Mom texted that she could meet me somewhere for a bite to eat, it was much easier to tell her to meet me at The Cheesecake Factory at the mall than it was to give her directions to try a local place in downtown Phoenix or elsewhere.  (Believe me, I've tried.)

Since we were there during happy hour, we decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and she wanted the HH caesar salad.  The ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fairly quick, and no wonder, since the roll only consisted of four tiny pieces!  We were hungry, and the pieces were so diminutive, that I didn't even get a chance to take a photo of the dish!  It was very tasty, but certainly not substantial, so I took another look at the HH menu and settled on the hummus.  While waiting for it to arrive, Mom and I shared the nicely-sized caesar salad, which was crisp-fresh and not overly-dressed.  

We decided to hold off on the salad for awhile, so as not to fill ourselves up on it.  The hummus and grilled pita bread arrivedl, and they too were flavorful; We couldn't get enough!  While we normally would've stuck w/ the happy hour menu, Mom had caught sight of a neighboring table's two platters and admired one of them, so I decided to order not the one she thought looked appetizing (the menu description turned her off), but what I had originally wanted to order instead of the hummus plate- a chicken pasta dish from the seasonal menu.  Two chicken breasts, pounded thin, battered, then fried, sitting atop of spaghetti w/ a basil-pesto cream sauce.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto and dressed arugula greens sprinkled w/ grated parmesan.  This dish tasted fabulous, and the different textures it offered made me swoon!  (I knew Mom enjoyed it as well, for she repeated at least two times how great the food was!)  However, I knew that the greasiness of this dish would haunt me after.  Still, a great savory dish, and next time, I'll just skip the happy hour menu (save the caesar salad, that's a must!) and order from the dinner menu, instead.

Great service, as always, although I just remembered that the honey wheat bread I had asked for arrived stale.  Funny that the server had even bothered to serve it, as she did warn us that it wasn't as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was baking in the oven.  Why even bring stale, hardened bread to the table?  It's the reason why I downgraded from the previous four-star rating to a three..."}
{"text":"They have a vast menu, so I've tried a lot of the items. My favorites are Sheila's chicken and avocado salad, miso salmon, and Jamaican black pepper shrimp and chicken. I ordered chicken and biscuits at my last visit and was a little disappointed due to the gravy being filmy and the biscuits being a little to hard for my liking, but that has been my only \"not so great\" visit over the last few years."}
{"text":"Literally just walked out of the Cheesecake Factory at Caesars Palace & it was yum!
 
They stayed open a little later than normal just because of the amount of people still eating.

We had the onions rings & crab wontons. Also the skinnylicious chicken tacos & salmon & skampi combo.

The Chris cheesecake was delicious but very sickly sweet. 2 of use couldn't finish it. 

Great meals & great friendly service.

Ps: No wonder Sheldon eats here ! :)"}
{"text":"Love Cheesecake Factory! Aside from the food the cheesecake is perfection! I got OREO, which was to die for!

I usually go to the one in Henderson but we went to this location after my cousins graduation with my family & our server Katrina C. Or Katarina (sorry! If I spelled it wrong) was ON POINT TO THE TEE, with checking on us & refills on drinks without even us asking! That definitely made it a better experience thank you!

Anyways all of our food was great I got the four cheese pasta with chicken which was so good, my sisters boyfriend got the chicken bellagio, my sister got the miso salmon & my cousin got the chicken marsala. All great dishes & a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Late night meal at the bar with my husband after a long flight.  Had the Steak Diane and it was just okay.  I wasn't a fan of the added mustard as an ingredient.  That's what I mostly tasted.  Not sure that's supposed to be so prevalent.

Ordered a Skinny Sangria and it was heavy on cinnamon.  Also had to call it out to my server like, \"Is this right?\"  I get it that cinnamon does certain things with the body and taste buds but I would have much rather preferred a Sangria with Stevia or something so it didn't taste different than other drinks.  I'm not in love with cinnamon like that.  It is \"Skinny\" though because I only had one.  

The wheat bread is always the same and I ate plenty of it.  I'll probably stick to Happy Hour and eat the beef and chicken sliders as I have been.  Stay away from the \"skinny\" stuff here.  Cheesecake is for the happy fattening food eaters."}
{"text":"Im a regular takeout guy, & every time i call its  
Long time to pickup the phone, understandable 
They're busy but it's consistent. Then as of a few months ago they removed the only dish i ordered every time I call!"}
{"text":"The love the dim lights, the temp was perfect, the server was prompt, laid back just the way I like it. The portions are huge but they have a new skinnylicious menu that I love."}
{"text":"It's Wednesday and that means one thing...poker night with the guys.
But the last few weeks at this have been torturous, as you go home penniless, drunk, and now having to face your wife.
And the worst part is how you'll probably lose again tonight.

Well not tonight,
Here's the plan.
Stop off at the Cheesecake Factory before the game. 
Order the four-cheese pasta, it's simply delightful. Have a couple beers to wash it down. 
Now, sit back and let the magic happen.

Of course you're going to lose at poker again tonight, but at least someone else is going to get tortured as your room-clearing farts decimate the place.

Revenge is sweet, and Cheesecake can help you serve up a big steaming bowl."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch with some friends, and I left with serious, serious sticker shock.  I knew it was touristy in advance, but I've never paid so much for food that wasn't on another level entirely.

Also, the menu is absolutely overwhelming for someone like me who has difficulty making mealtime decisions.  It was like they had every kind of food you could ever want, and I don't think of that as a compliment."}
{"text":"we went for my sisters birthday, they hooked us up with a large enough table to seat the family, even with last minute reservations.  food was good, service was good.  had a great time."}
{"text":"Joe is an excellent waiter that made sure our glasses were always kept full and had recommendations when we were overwhelmed by the seemingly unending menu. The cheesecakes, salmon, romano chicken, and pizza were delicious. Skip the hot fudge when ordering the Oreo cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan and always will be, the food is always good here and the selection is unbelievable.  I know it is a franchise but a kick ass one if I may say.  I love all the martinis....and I do mean all.  I love the strawberry lemonade, I love the cheesecake (of course), I love the service, the atmosphere is definitely high end but you can still go casual.  I have had several meals hear and could not possibly remember them all but I have never not liked my dish....except that I can never finish because their portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"You know for a place that charges as much as they do you would figure they could at least come out with some really good entrees. I mean I'll give it to them on the chicken pot stickers fairly tasty item but it wasn't any better than day a ghengis grill where it costs half as much right? My gf got the skinny Asian chicken which she wasn't very impressed by at all and for something on a low cal memo the peon was ridiculous but I digress. My option was the Baja chicken tacos with rice and beans again I wouldn't mind the price of the meal was worth it but the tacos and rice had no flavor and the only hot sauce the carried was Tabasco which is awful on a taco. So needles to say we were both looking for a dessert to really pull the meal together and is the cheese cake factory so hell why not we ordered an oreo cheese cake and I was really excited for it to come only to be let down I wanted to give this place one star but our server was great and very attentive so I the an extra one in for him. Ladies and gentlemen there ate plenty of places in Vegas to spend your money on great food don't waste it here."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chains but this was my 1st experience there & I was very disappointed.

First off,  the restaurant is very nice looking.  I liked the ambiance from my point of view in the lobby.  When we were seated... not as much.  We were tucked in this little alley off to the side of the bar that led to what I'm sure was a nicer room that looked out into the parking lot.  We couldn't see much from where we were sitting except the waiters running back and forth and the little area where they entered orders on the computer. 

But I'm jumping ahead... we got there a few minutes before 7 and had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  Some people coming in after us were told up to an hour and a half! I know this because the pager/beeper they give you is only active IN their lobby.  So there were about 50-70 people all standing around this lobby starring at each other and the cheesecake in the case.  Not cool.

Finally our beeper went off and then we were told to stand in a certain spot to wait for our name to be called. More waiting.  Then we were taken to our little alley table.

The menu is 21 pages long.  And then there is a Skinnylicious menu on top of that. Ridiculous.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  It was fine.  I've had better.

I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken.  It was OK. Again... I've had better.
Boyfriend got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta: Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce
I didn't taste it but he said it was fine but nothing he would crave again later - and that he liked another pasta dish from another restaurant much better.
We each ordered a slice of cheesecake.  I got the Chocolate mouse cheesecake which I thought would be light and fluffy but no.  It was very heavy.

It was very expensive in my opinion.  We both got water, we shared an app, each had an entree and a piece of cheesecake and this came to $71 after tip.  For what we got? It was not worth it at all.   2 stars on Yelp means \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" That is exactly right in this case.  We will most definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Have an indecisive group of people with you? Have a group of people who want all different types of food? Cheesecake Factory has a large menu with different types of food. I came here for lunch with my mom during the holiday season. Luckily there was no wait (which never happens!) we were seated and waited on. Our server was great. The only negative is that it was really cold inside."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cobb Salad,it horrible uncooked bacon ,wilted lettuce,and it looked Ames,my hubby ordered tostada salad another disappointment,cold  grilled chic,for the price it was dissociating,and the waitress was rude about the tip,horrible as the food was she shouldn't expect anything,I won't be eating there again..."}
{"text":"Hot or Miss and tonight was a huge miss. Came out to celebrate my wife's work accomAppetizer and servers were great. Long wait for main dishes. My wife's came out with undercooked cold rice and missing key ingredient. My dish came out without side (fries). After waiting a long time for fries they came out undercooked and hard potatoey. Manager would only offer to remake my wife's dish. He didn't even address the problem with the fries. Was just a disappointing experience. Manager needs training and kitchen manager need to be replaced."}
{"text":"We have had excellent service & food here!! Derek our waiter this past Saturday was just amazing he was so personable & checked up on us perfectly even when they had an hour wait.  Food is soo incredible we have loved everything & have been there about 5 times since it opened. Keep up the great work everyone!!"}
{"text":"Bring your reading glasses for the menu!
It a big chain so not too much to say.

Surroundings- Its huge , menu is overwhelming and has advertising with I find annoying.

Staff- Some of the best. 

Eats- cant complain, I can eat the pizzettes all day long for 4.95 all day long! The ricotta and sausage or the Pear and goat cheese is the best!

Have a go , you wont be sorry!"}
{"text":"If my husband gets on my bad side, he knows to bring me here to turn things around - one of my favorite restaurants in town. We always have a great experience here whether it's carry out or dine in. I wish I had the server's name who helped us yesterday, she was awesome. We decided to come in with our 5 month old and she was very helpful when it came to the pace, bringing out the check and boxes early just in case, very patient all around. After all, no one wants to be stuck in the middle of a nice restaurant with a screaming baby. So glad we have a restaurant like this close to home!"}
{"text":"Love this place, i love cheesecake.  They have a great selection of cheesecake, it's an entire factory dedicated to cheesecake.  Try the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake, at just shy of 2,000 it is literally to \"die\" for. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"I love taking my mom out every month to have lunch or dinner. 
Since it was Ash Wednesday and the start of lent, I decided to take her to the Cheesecake Factory for meatless meals. 
I've eaten here several times and I've never had a bad dish here. We enjoyed a couple of small appetizers first and I ordered the corn fritters and a plate of stuffed mushrooms. The meals came with a basket full of complimentary breads. For small plates, they sure give you a lot. I was getting full just from eating the appetizers. 
We also ordered the shrimp platter, breaded salmon, mashed potatoes, asparagus and washed them down with Raspberry Lemonade. For dessert, we got the white chocolate macadamia cheese cake. OMG.......Heaven. Totally scrumptious. 
I felt like a total heifer and if I eat here everyday, my booty is going to get huge! 
But this is one of my mom's favorite places, so whatever mom wants she gets. 
Service was excellent as always plus our waiter was super cute!

{"text":"The food is ok, not exactly the greatest I've ever had. When I walk in just by looking how decked out the place is, I think I'm gonna get amazing food but I didn't. It's a little over priced. The only thing I really appreciated about the cheese cake factory is their cheesecake. Banana cheesecake, coconut cream pie cheesecake, tirimisu cheesecake, the list goes on and on of awesome cheesecakes that they rock at making. Id go their just for the cheesecake. The place is packed on the weekends...too packed for me. Overall ok place."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory because of their large selection of food and big portion. I was excited to try The Cheesecake Factory to see if it'll be the same as the States.

The fried zucchini ($7.95) was very good - perfectly coated and deep friend. There were no issues with the batter falling off the zucchini. I remember enjoying the avocado eggrolls ($14.95) and they were also really good especially with the minty sauce. I like how they took two very healthy food and turned it unhealthy :P

The Pasta da Vinci ($16.95 - lunch portion) had caramelized onions, mushrooms, and chicken. The chicken was very tender and the overall dish was very flavourful. I thought the portion was decent for the price.

The service was great and the food came quite quickly. They were incredibly organized with the whole lineup (which they should be since they've been opened for a while now). I'm so glad there's finally a restaurant I like inside Yorkdale!"}
{"text":"My wife ,son and I had a nice dinner .after an initial wait due to the amount of people eating here which usually means it will be worth the wait 

And it didn't disappoint , the menu was full of choices and the portion size was on the large size for us BUT it tasted great , the service was attentive but not over bearing and when it came to the cheese cake wow and there was a 30th Anniversary cheese cake to funny because it are 30th Anniversary is why we here this trip so we had to have one of them to .m, supersized portions that tasted delicious, we see a lot of people taking there's home as the couldn't manage anymore food 

Worth a visit not too badly priced"}
{"text":"I ate at this Cheesecake Factory last week. I ordered the Grilled Steak Tacos. We also shared the
Chicken Taquitos appetizer. The food was all delicious. The custom ranch is very good. The sweet tea was very good."}
{"text":"Had the combo pizza, it was super yummy and cooked just right! Save room for cheesecake. Hubby and I shared the Snickers cheesecake and it was fluffy and not TOO sweet."}
{"text":"Over all it was a pleasant experience, the service was a bit slow (could have been better). Took a long while from the time we ordered until the time we received our food and, mind you it was an early dinner so they were not that busy. Overall the food was good and everyone was pleased with what they ordered."}
{"text":"First time visiting Cheesecake Factory.  We decided to bring E's mom here after hitting up bingo at RR.  There was only a small wait of maybe 5 minutes when we arrived.  Very dark in this place.  Like really dim.  Going for romance maybe?!?! lol.
The food was delicious!  Service was fast and we will definitely go back.  I recommend going before 5 on the weekends.  As we were leaving HOLY COW was the wait long and so many people!"}
{"text":"Love this location. The biltmore is a nice place to stop on my way home from work and I always stop in for at least a piece of cheesecake but the food is great here too. They have so many different options. Mexican, Italian, American delicious."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday morning 10 mins after they open and there was still a 15 min wait.  Not sure why when it looked pretty empty to me. Maybe they have a system where they want a bunch of people to get seated at the same time. 

Our server was awesome and really accommodating. I needed to place 3 separate orders because it was a work lunch and she was totally cool and helpful about it. 

Ordered the fish and chips from the lunch menu and the portion was huge. Chips were a little salty. Coleslaw was delicious. Their pizza and salad also came in huge portions. Definitely enough for 2 people. I also got their avocado eggrolls and it was ok. Had a bunch of leftovers to take home. 

Sadly, their cheesecake delivery was late or didn't come in today so they didn't have many left. I did get their last lemon raspberry cheesecake (a full cake) and it looks really good. 

I would definitely come back again but would never wait more than 30 mins. Not that worth it."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory! I hate to do this....in the bar area, waitresses were absolutely the WORST I'VE EVER HAD! This is my first bad review.
Asked for no onions..... onions on EVERYTHING. We sat for 25 mins before we got asked if we had a server to take our drink orders.....The water glasses had lipstick on all the rims, and I'm pretty sure there were Sea Monkeys in the water we were served. My drink had to be reordered 3 times..... and it was 2 shots of silver tequila on ice.....takes a genius. I could go on....I'm annoyed by having to relive it....
Cheesecake Factory HR....take note:
Stop hiring people that haven't fully developed the ability to walk upright. 
You're welcome."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed lunch at this location. The food was quick and service professional. Fried Mac N Cheese was delicious.  Cole slaw and fish and chips not bad either.  Wish I had room for desert. Still left with left overs. Portion sizes too big. I like to sample a bit of everything."}
{"text":"I chose to come to the Cheesecake Factory on a Friday night around 8pm. What a mistake this was in more ways then one...ready!?!?! Here goes....my bf took me here for our weekly dinner date (restaurant of my choice). I knew the restaurant had been open for a while and seeing that I'm only 10 minutes away from Yorkdale I though \"why not give this place a try\" thinking that all the hype of dinning here has subsided but boy was I wrong! I may be the only person in this world that does not like cheese cake and I will not  justify my madness for feeling this way :) (my bf loves cheese cake, so this was a compromise for both of us). We waited for two hours before our buzzer went off and once it did we had to wait again for another 10 minutes to be seated...at this point I'm already \"hangry\" and just wanted some food. The place is decorated tastefully, well lit, a little over priced for the quality of the food and the menu is limited (except the cheese cake selection). The washroom is on one side of the restaurant and we were seated on the other side of the restaurant, so if you have mobility issue it will be difficult to manuver at ease because the aisle are not wide and the traffic between the servers, bus boy/girl, customer's coming and going. Once seated, the restaurant was cold (and it was already cold outside) so sitting in a cold restaurant, eating room temperature like food was not enjoyable. Our waitress came to take our order right away, she ask us what we like to drink and if we wanted to place our main order too (did I mention it was our 1st time here). We ordered our drinks and an appetizer to share (crab and artichoke dip) disappointed no crab meat at all and it was cold!! I felt the urgent rush from our server to take our order and leaving me feeling that they want there guests to experience the \"ins of dinning and out the door you go\" experience. The sound of people was loud and the sound of music was even louder. 
I had the salmon with mash potatoes and broccoli, my bf had the cuban sandwhich with fries. My salmon dish was serve luke warm temperature......disgusting!!  At this point it was 11:15 p.m. and we were both to tired and I was not able to finish since it was so late and we were so sleepy from waiting earlier and from boredom. Of course we order the Oreo cheese cake to go. Most dissapointing dinning experience in a long time. It would be nice if the restaurant offer some kind of sampler snacks or drinks for all the other customers waiting patiently for there turn to dine at the Cheese cake factory.  This place is just over rated to dine just wait until the hype is over or take a trip across the border and experience dinning in the States. I'm sure you will have a better experience."}
{"text":"My experience here was great! I've heard many good things about this restaurant, so once I heard The Cheesecake Factory was opening a location in Yorkdale, I had to try it out. 
I went on a Saturday morning around 10:30am, we were told the wait would be about an hour and were given a buzzer. By the time we walked around the mall the hour was already up. We made our way back to the front desk to ask how much longer and a staff member kindly checked for us. We were next to be buzzed & ended up getting seated 5 minutes later. 
We were seated in a booth beside a window. Our server (forgot his name) was amazing, made good recommendations considering it was our first time, was very attentive, friendly, and checked up on us regularly. 
Our food came out really fast, I'd say we waited no longer than 10 minutes. They give bread in the meantime which is nice. I ordered the Fish Tacos (roughly $19), it comes with 4 decent sized tacos as well as rice and beans on the side, I highly recommend this dish!! My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (roughly $20), he enjoyed his meal as well. 
As for dessert, we had a hard time narrowing it down to only two cheesecakes out of the dozens of delicious ones they have, but we finally decided on the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake (both about $9 each). Soo good! Very smooth and creamy, we enjoyed both. 

Overall the lineup wasn't too bad since we went early, the staff here are very friendly and the food is pretty good! Will definitely be coming back to try out more items on the menu."}
{"text":"The negative reviews here are pretty accurate. I'm glad my gf was open to eating somewhere else and just coming here for dessert.  As many have stated, slow service. What frustrated me and really killed the moment for us both was that we ordered some nice coffees to go along with our cheesecake, and they were served in regular pint cups.  Wtf is that about? I've never felt so snobby in my life, but you will see, every where you go you will get coffee in a mug, and now I know from this experience that the cup makes such a difference.  You either burned your mouth drinking from the straw, or drink only foam drinking from the cup. A pint glass JUST DOESN'T WORK."}
{"text":"Place is nice but too busy. I don't think everyone will have a slow experience but be ready for slow service just in case. Specially if you order something that's more than just a salad. Took 50min to get my food. Not the best first experience at this one. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory!!! This particular one in Chandler is great. The food and service is consistently done well. The menu is HUGE.

Victor S. was our server this time. He was professional, polite, and attentive. He was very quick in delivering our drinks, bread, and appetizer. The food we ordered came out hot and delicious.  
My favorites are the Blazing Buffalo bites, Skinny MOJITO, Almond Crusted Salmon Salad, Chicken Romano, Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake, Lemon Meringue Cheesecake, or Banana Cream Pie Cheesecake. 

Thank goodness for Intermittent Fasting!! One cheesecake is my whole days worth of calories!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday afternoon at around 3pm. The atmosphere is good, the restaurant was very very crowded. The staffs were friendly and fast. I only had the fresh strawberry cheesecake. It was good but a little sweeter than how i prefer. The size of the slice was ok. The toppings coming with the cheesecake were good and they have many types to choose from. Overall it was a good experience but too overpriced (9.95$ for 1 slice plus tax = 11.24$) and overrated. Do not think i will come back"}
{"text":"New Cheesecake Factory at the Premium outlet in LV. The staff were all very nice and friendly. We came here Sunday branch and ordered a monte cristo and burlee French toast with a side of bacon. The food took awhile to prepare but the staff made it more enduring to wait. We got a refill of the wheat bread and butter. 
For those of you who have been to the premium oUtlet in LV, Cheesecake Factory is a nice addition and hangout place while waiting for diehard shoppers."}
{"text":"The food is always good- which is why I come back. My burger was over cooked and it still tasted fine. However the service is never fantastic, today exemplified that. Took 5+ minutes to be waited on, and even longer to get our checks. It wasn't particularly busy at that time either. Overall, once every few years is enough here."}
{"text":"The food was better than expected but the other aspects were far worse.

I got a decent parking spot so I was in a good mood for my dinner.  Appetizers came and we were so hungry we tucked into them and in no time they were gone.  More bread.

The entree, I don't want you to continue reading.  Wait ten minutes staring at this sentence.  Wait ten more minutes staring at this sentence.  I bet you just kept reading.  I didn't have that option.  With a squad of hungry children flailing about we waited over forty minutes after the apps, and that is even longer than our order time, for our food.

It took forever and our waiter avoided us most of that time.  It was excruciating with children flipping over complaining they are starving.  I was feeling the same way.  I made it through part of my meal and then I didn't feel well.  I wanted to pay and leave.  That took far longer and we had some bill errors that had to be fixed.  The entire thing took even longer.  I wasn't feeling well and the moment I got my credit card back I bolted for the door.

Get your dessert here and you are fine.  Order an entree at your own risk.  I suggest Maggianos for drinks and food, and the factory for cake."}
{"text":"Okay so I actually had difficulty giving a star rating here! The food is awesome I've been to CCF numerous times and rarely find myself complaining about the food. My goto favorites are as follows:
Appetizers: I order the Thai Lettuce Wraps for lunch it comes out beautiful on a huge plate!  I can literally drink the tamarind cashew sauce!
Salad: I LOVE the chopped salad. Their balsamic vinegarette is yummy. 
Pasta: I have two favorites here, the Bistro Shrimp and the Louisiana chicken.
Specialty: the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp omg orange saucy goodness!!! 
Fish: You CAN NOT go wrong with the Miso salmon oooommmmmgggg
Dessert: brownie sundae cheesecake mmmm
I've ordered all of those items a few times! There are tons of options and they seem to do them all well!

Now back to my star prob. The service is more often lackluster then great. I might expect awesome service buuuut when you come to my table and say \"what would you like to drink\" it's just rude..... How about \"Hi! I'm so and so\"???
The food is awesome, the service blah. So I rate CCF a 3.5"}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner last night, there were a good amount of people but the place was not even close to being full.  Our server Cynthia was awesome however the kitchen was the slowest I have ever seen here.

We were seated right away and waited a bit for her to come over, but once she did we got drinks really fast and order taken pretty fast an then waited and waited and waited.

Our server had a great sense of humor an made sure our drinks stayed filled, offered more bread and really made the overall experience am enjoyable one even though it seemed like it took the kitchen forever to get our food out.

Once the food came, everything was prepared just as ordered and was good.  I would definitely go back as the food is good and our server, one of the best we have had there in a long time."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night at around 7pm.  When arrived we were told we would have a 20 minute wait which was expected. After only 10 minutes out table was ready. My wife had a steak and I had the pasta. Both meals were excellent and would recommend them both."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and had a great experience!

Heather was the best server that we've had here. We brought our 1 year old son with us and when she dropped off our drinks, she brought him sliced bananas. Our son is very impatient and likes to eat as soon as we sit. That was the kindest gesture that a server has done for us. 

Thank you, Heather! You are awesome!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy a good meal at The Cheesecake Factory. I've recently started seeing a personal trainer, so it was my goal to find something on the healthier side. I ordered the Lemon Garlic Shrimp off the Skinnylicious menu. It was the perfect portion of shrimp, pasta and asparagus and didn't taste skinny at all. It was delicious and paired perfectly with a glass of Chianti. Our server was also very attentive, but she did bring the check while I was still eating which was annoying."}
{"text":"I visit the Cheesecake Factory frequently with my family for birthdays and holidays. The service at this location is always superb and I've never had a bad meal. They are always very accommodating.

Another perk about going here is their Skinnylicious menu. Many of their entrees on the regular menu are calorie packed, so the Skinny menu offers many delicious and healthy options for those trying to shed some pounds."}
{"text":"I have been to this chain restaurant in other cities in the past and it's my first time after a gap of 3-4 yrs. Quite interesting to see a big change in the service and quantity of food.  I remember the service was poor and the food quantity  was very less for the price at all other locations. May be it's just this location. I went in a group of seven and ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees. Entrees came in big portions. Especially the jambalaya dish was huge. I loved the bourbon street omelette. 
Chicken marsala, calamari, chicken dumplings are always my favorite here. I highly recommend angel hair pasta for all the pasta dishes.

Bottom line: I  would love to come to this location again if I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Great food,  Atmosphere very quiet , even though located in the Forum Shops. Service was great! Had very cool server named Tracey"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. The sandwich I got was the Italian and the bread was like biting I into a brick. I asked to have it hot and the waitress said she would ask if that was ok...
The sandwich wa as 80% turkey and very little Italian.  We won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but wait time was longer than normal. We felt rushed through like cattle. Waiter was very dry and asked us if we needed a box about 12 min into meal. 
  I said yes. When the wife said no he just swooped up her plate and walked off half way through her meal!   The people that were seated after us were served first. I rarely give a negative review but this deserved it! Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the only chain restaurants I frequent because I think their cheesecake and their selection is absolutely amazing. Hubby and I usually share an appetizer and then two cheesecakes. Our favorites include any of the egg rolls, fried Mac and cheese balls and lettuce wraps. And for dessert either the Reese's, the Oreo, the S'more or the the Chocolate Hazelnut (although there are a TON more awesome options)!

Another cool factor, if you have a baby they give you complimentary plate of banana slices. Who knew?! My baby boy certainly enjoyed those."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were enjoying a date night without the kiddo after a long crazy week and decided we needed to eat at the one and only chain restaurant we absolutely adore - The Cheesecake Factory. It was a Tuesday night around 9:30p and there was a 40 minute wait. Between exploring nearby shops and good conversation the time passed quickly. We were sat at a table near the back on the first floor and our waiter was with us right away. He took awesome care of us all evening - some of the best service I've had at a Cheesecake Factory. 

We recently learned how much we love their loaded Nachos. So we ordered them with the \"spicy\" chicken to share. For dessert, we tried to new chocolate coffee cheesecake and also the Godiva brownie sundae (one of our go-tos). The new Cheesecake had great flavor, but not quite the same texture as other cheesecakes.....it felt like it stuck to my mouth in different way. Overall it was good, but next time I think we'll go back to one of our favorites (Oreo or Reese's).  

There's so much good food here! I know the menu can be over-whelming. I'm not much for their pizzas and I feel their burgers are just fine. I usually prefer a crazy Appetizer (any of the awesome egg rolls or fried Mac & cheese balls) or a salad if I want something light (Cobb or Greek)."}
{"text":"The staff is so attentive and sweet! The counter take out is efficient and always ready to take your order! The bathrooms are clean and the booths are always wiped down.
This is one of the nicest CCF on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Have not been to Cheesecake Factory in awhile, but was there with friends last night. Ann was out server and did an amazing job. Our food was fantastic and Ann did a great job! Can't wait to go back. Servers make all the difference!"}
{"text":"First time ever at a Cheesecake Factory. We loved it. The menu is intimidating due to sheer volume of choices but we ordered three different dishes and all were very good. Will go back to Cheesecake Factory. P.S. We even had leftovers."}
{"text":"I have a friend who only eats pastries that are made with love-either homemade or Madison, Wisconsin's Lazy Jane's scones. 
Before I made more than two cheesecakes in my life I came here and I knew I could make a better cheesecake. Yeah they have some funky flavors and if a group of people all want a different cheesecake, then this would be the place. 
They are very easy recipes for much tastier cheesecakes on ze internet. The service was ok. I was not impressed by my cardboard pizza."}
{"text":"I love going to the States to eat here cause the portions are big and the cheesecake is delicious. I was excited to see it come to Canada for the first time. 

I've been here twice now and first visit the wait was quite long, getting the buzzer was fast (around 11AM) but wait time to eat wasn't until 2PM  service was great as always but my friends and I felt it didn't live up to their big portions down south. The cheesecake was also a super long wait which was annoying. Second visit improved. My friends and I showed up right when they opened! We were seated right away and they had their brunch and full menu. This time my friends pasta looked huge, like the states portion. Much improvement. Brunch was decent as well. 

I would say this place is a 3.5/5 - enjoyable food but I would avoid if there are crowds. It almost makes driving down to Buffalo more worth it!"}
{"text":"Waited a few months before coming near this place as the initial lines were hours. Finally had a chance to come here for lunch on a weekday (got here just shy of 11:30AM opening - picked up a buzzer) and had no wait time! The restaurant is huge with plenty of seating inside and on the patio.. but it did fill up pretty quickly (no real wait though - which was good).

As usual, served with fresh warm bread and butter to start.

We ordered the Chicken and Avocado Salad (lunch size ~$16?), Portobello Mushroom Burger ($18) and the Pasta Da Vinci (lunch size ~$16?). The portion of the salad did seem a little bit smaller compared to American portion, but delicious nonetheless and the Pasta Da Vinci lacked a little bit of flavour compared to the many times I've had it in the States.. not sure if this was a one-off or what.

Finished off with a piece of Celebration Cheesecake ($10) which was delicious! Pricing is more or less the same as in the States - not bad!

Service was great, food did take a little time but that's normal.

Overall, would definitely come back if there was no wait."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! Don't get me wrong I love Cheesecake Factory but the customer service in this place was the worst. I went in with 8 of my closest friends because it was my birthday dinner on a Saturday night of course I was expecting it to be busy since that's how it usually is on Saturday nights in any restaurant. We went in and ordered a table for 8 took about 20-25 minutes. We sat down ordered what we wanted with drinks . Took them 25 minutes to bring out the drinks. They had already brought out the bread. Didn't even offer water while we were waiting. I had ordered extra sauce with my pasta. So they brought the pasta but no sauce. They came by once to say it's coming out but it took them 30-45 mins to bring it out by that time I was done with my dry pasta. No longer needed it. The worst part is that my friends had ordered a tirumasu cake as a surprised and the manager came up and told the whole table we are just waiting on the dessert... Really!!!!!! Just ruin the surprise. Very unsatisfied with the service here!!! Never returning I rather go to Summerline or Henderson Cheesecake Factory!!!"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. The business practices of this establishment (and every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to) are not customer friendly. They don't tell you a wait time over the phone and they don't take reservations. Even if you call ahead and try to let them know you're willing to drop a couple hundred bucks on a large party (because eating here isn't cheap) they don't respond with anything other than a \"I'm sorry, we don't want to disappoint people by quoting wait times that may not be accurate.\" Well, Cheesecake Factory, you've disappointed me by NOT quoting me wait times. I guess you can't please everybody and in this case I am the one not pleased. WE CALLED THREE TIMES to work with this establishment. We were told three different things. Now, I'm saying one thing. No more Cheesecake Factory ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and I've always received excellent service but the last time I was here I was seriously impressed!
Let me start by saying my lovely husband thought it would be a good idea to take the whole family out for lunch on sunday, mother's day, noon time .... let's just say my expectations for an amazing experience were not very high.  I was definitely proven wrong on my trip here! The waiting area was obviously ridiculously packed so I expected the wait to be nothing less then an hour. Thirty minutes later we were sat and promptly offered bread and had our drink order taken . Our food arrived within 15/20 min after we ordered and let me say it was delicious! Our server Dan was was super great. He checked on us several times , refilled our drinks and asked how our food was . I joked with my husband that this was the day all the cheesecake factory employees had been training for because it doesn't get crazier than mother's day and they nailed it! Thanks again for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Came in with my boyfriend for some dessert and I have to say that coming for years now; nothing has has changed! Same friendly staff--of course not all original--and great food! At least I know where tobgo for some awesome cheesecake. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Visited a close friend and her husband for dinner on a Tuesday. Service and food was MUCH improved from the first time. Bit turned off at the fact that ginger ale was $3, however. Seems very steep for a Pepsi product in a chain restaurant. They are improving which is good! The verdict is still out on this CCF."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I stopped at this location for lunch during the LVMarket trade show. Compared to the food vendors at the market it was much more reasonable in price and with a lot more options.

The wait was only about 5 minutes for a table and our sever was quick and friendly. As for food I had the guacamole salad with grilled shrimp added. The portion size was huge and the overall flavor was delicious. I'd come back here again just for this salad.

Another typical chain restaurant, but with good service and decent food. A great lunch or dinner option if you're shopping at the outlet mall."}
{"text":"Food is always great.  I love the meatloaf sandwich.  The service is really hit or miss.  Sometimes I have great servers who are passionate about their work.  Other times service is just ok.  The ground is always super slick and sticky and it really takes away from the nice decor."}
{"text":"We ended up here twice in our Vegas stay. They are open to mixing up the menu a bit (adding, subtracting things) The servers kept our drinks up. The food came out hot. Our dinner was fantastic. 
On our lunch there, our server was somewhat non-existent,  and our food was eh. My alfredo came out rather watery, and broccoli undercooked, but it was okay. 
Which is why this review got 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic happy hour! I do wish they'd expand their happy hour white wines, and the food options; but for $6 (normally $10), you can't beat the price for a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"I have been to several cheesecake factories and like this one the best.

The cuban sandwich is a delight.  Try it.  They also have some healthier options that are actually GOOD.  The last time I was there the waiter was a delight.  She worked really hard and did a great job.

Yes, its probably pricier then it should be but the cheesecake factory doesn't pretend to be cheap.

Get the heath bar cheesecake.  It's just that good."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing, however, would I wait 3+ hours for it? Nope. I was lucky and I only had to wait an hour and a half on the Friday that I went.  I understand why there is a lot of mixed feelings about the place, it mostly comes from the ridiculous wait times. What was really convenient though, is they gave you a device that vibrates when your table is ready, so you could roam around a bit instead of waiting in the crowded area in the front and even wait in your car. I recommend getting the chicken parm, it was delicious and huge--really worth the money.  I recommend going an hour or two earlier than the time you want to eat, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We went down to Cheesecake Factory ahead of a busy day of shopping and a show at the Smith Center. I usually don't like Cheesecake Factory because they tend to take a bit longer to serve you, but this time it was super speedy. We ordered some lunch specials and a Shepherd's Pie. The Pie was really good, although it was a bit fancier than some of the Pies I've ordered at other places before. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal. The food was good, the service was good, the speed and price were right -- really, nothing to complain about. The only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars is that I was not wowed by anything, but I do appreciate that everything was solidly good."}
{"text":"The service sucks except for couple employees who have been there a long time. If it wasn't for Karnina and few other hard working employees then we wouldn't go there anymore. Careless employee when we order to go, I ask him every time, did you remember to put everything, he says yes, we look and there are always couple of things missing. The manager needs to do something about a better system of making sure nothing is missing in a persons order. We always order $80 or more for our friends and family, usually $100-200. So when things are missing it's disappointing. We love Cheesecake Factory but this location needs to improve in there to go orders."}
{"text":"When we arrived we thought we were going to have to wait a LONG time for a table because of how busy it was and the fact they don't take reservations on weekends. However, it turned out we got a seat after only 15 minutes... they have quite a few tables. Our server did a great job and was prompt with everything. She even brought us extra bread and a sliced up banana for our two young boys. We ordered food (I had a bbq burger and fries), which arrived quickly. I was looking forward to the Thai Peanut Noodle dish they make, but sadly it is no longer on the menu and they wouldn't make it for me. The burger was good, nothing special though. The cheese cake was really good; it isn't the best but still tasty. I would recommend and return."}
{"text":"We came here for my man's birthday and wait was 1 1/2 hrs on a Saturday note, not bad. We tried the eggroll sampler, Cajun pasta, and chicken Madeira. The dishes were tasty, and healthier than we remembered.  Cheesecake was delicious, vanilla bean and Chris's outrageous. It's pricey but worth it for a nice evening."}
{"text":"Here now for our mothers 83rd birthday party. Put our name in for 18 and they're now telling us they won't hold our table past noon because not everyone in our party is here yet.  Guess they don't want our hundreds of dollars in business."}
{"text":"Been years since I have been there.  A big crowd for lunch today but plenty of room at the bar. Most people don't realize that sitting there gives as much  room as a small table. Plus the bartenders love it, more
$$$ in tips for them
Great service, good drinks, and the food was very good. The menu is huge, something for anyone. And the cheesecake ....well it's the reason you go, right???"}
{"text":"Ive never been a huge fan of Cheesecake except for their amazing cheesecake.  What I have eaten here, Ive been happy with.

First off, when you go there and sit down, they give you a catalog style menu that's about 20 pages long mixed in with company advertisements.  Cheesecake Factory has a ton of food.  

I love their bread they bring out (of course not the best bread of all restaurants.. that goes to Firebirds).  Make sure to ask for more butter!

They give you huge glasses for the drinks so that's a plus.  Ok now onto the food.  I personally love the Cuban sandwhich and for an appetizer you cant go wrong with the artichoke.  Just delicious.

I go to CF maybe every four months.  It's not always on top of my list, but i\"ll go if others want to.

and last but not least... the dessert is top notch and a must (assuming you're not full)."}
{"text":"The food always seems to get better with each trip.  Of course when I leave Im stuffed and feel like Im going to explode.  That's my own fault..

I like this location.  We are always seated pretty quickly.  If we have to wait it's maybe 10min average.  Not too bad at all. Service has always been great here.  If you ask for extra's they bring it and never say anything. 

When it comes to the food, Cheesecake has pretty much anything you could imagine.  Breakfast burrito? they have it.. Chinese food? they have it..  You name it, they have it.

I found that sometimes, you can order an appetizer and it's the size of a regular meal.  I love their buffalo blast chicken appetizers.  it's a ton of food and it will fill you up with no problems.

the one thing Ive never had luck with is their club sandwich.  Always been dry for me.  

And now we talk about the cheesecake itself.  The pieces are huge and super rich. I recommend splitting it with someone.  They are great though."}
{"text":"We visited the Cheesecake Factory for the first time today for lunch.  Our food was excellent and very generous portions.  The cost was slightly higher than some other similar restaurants but the taste of the food and portion size made up for it.  The service was excellent although the preparers of the food seemed slow."}
{"text":"Had a five star experience last night. Robert was our server and his service was on point. Our drinks were always full, and we were always being checked on. 

We started with a Caesar salad and some lettuce wraps. Salad was very basic, but flavor was amazing. Perfect start. We had the portobello mushroom, garlic, ginger wraps. So amazing. Mushrooms sautéed to perfection. My boyfriend was very happy with the start of our meal. 

We had the steak with medallions off this skinnylicious menu and we also had the chicken Alfredo.  The steak on our plate was amazing. Mashed potatoes with asparagus, roasted tomatoes, and steak medallions all layered on top made a perfect combo. Steak was cooked medium rare as requested. Juicy chicken and perfect al dente noodles mixed with the amazing flavor of the Alfredo sauce. 

So happy. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri. It was blended all the way through with no ice in the bottom like I experience from most places. Deliciously fresh flavor with just a hint of rum. 

We had a slice of caramel cheese cake to finish it all off. Dinner was amazing. Great date night. Boyfriend was happy. So I am extremely happy."}
{"text":"I had an excellent lunch with co-workers. I had a salad and cheescake. Everything was good. My friends enjoyed their lunch too. Our server David was fantastic. The service was fast, friendly and zero mistakes."}
{"text":"Some of the best clam chowder I've ever had anywhere in the world and some of the best shrimp meals in fact just about everything we have there is wonderful"}
{"text":"Waste 2 hours of your life waiting to eat large portions of overpriced mediocre meals.  If you feel like getting HANGRY (Hungry + Angry) decide on a family dinner night to The Cheesecake Factory where they do NOT take reservations and have built out a ridiculous 'in-line' system where they overpromise and under-deliver on their expected wait times. 

We were told it would take 55-70 minutes for our party of 6 (4 adults, a toddler and a baby) and 110 minutes later we were confirmed that we were next, only to find out that they had us waiting in line as a party of 5... and that they were trying to find a table for us \"again\" after they realized our correct party size. What made it worse was that every time we checked in to see where we were in \"line\" they assured us they were finding us a table that would fit the kids and strollers.

Don't go unless you do NOT value your personal time. 

The cheesecake itself is good and so is the pleasant service, minus the \"line\" hosts."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake factory is in chandler fashion center on chandler blvd, being in a mall it's always pretty crowded.We went in for an early dinner around 5:30 the place was packed but we got a table pretty quickly (it generally takes more time if you're specific about what section you want to be seated in).

We ordered the 
~Typhoon punch (raspberry vodka with pineapple,passion fruit and orange juice) $10.50
~Lemon drop (citrus and fresh lemonade) $3.95
~Crispy crab bites (little crab cakes/balls served with a mustard sauce) $7.50
~Dynamite shrimp (crispy tempura battered shrimp with a spicy sauce) $6.95

The drinks were very refreshing,they have four variations of lemonade and they make them quite well.I was not a fan of the mustard sauce.The portions are small for appetizers.They also serve bread (sourdough/wheat) at the table.Service was slow.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Save some room in your stomach for those guilty pleasures, this is The Cheesecake Factory after all.They have an insane variety of cheesecakes.The Red velvet, Fresh strawberry and the original are my favorites.
However, if you are not into Cheesecakes they also have some mean ice cream sundaes and   cakes.The Black out cake is so Gooey(must have if your a chocoholic).
I generally end up eating just appetizers and desserts because the dessert portions are really huge and can be shared by two (or Not).

They have a pretty extensive menu with a good variety of cocktails,Beer,Wine,Milkshakes etc.
I tried the Peach Bellini which is a blend of Champagne,peaches and peach Liqueur.It was quite refreshing and tasted more like a peach smoothie nothing too strong.We also had some stuffed Mushrooms and Crispy fried Cheese.

The booths are cozy with dim lights,service was fast and friendly.This Location definitely scores higher than the others.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Always a good choice and with their big menu its easy to find things for everyone. Late hours, good service and options make this place a classic fav of mine."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory was very overpriced for what I is served.  It was a disappointment but I guess you can't expect much out of a big chain corp."}
{"text":"We ate here last night for my wife's birthday and the food was delicious. The whole first time experience would've been perfect if not for our very rude server David"}
{"text":"For sophistication's sake, I want to give The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars, but let's be honest . . . I love this restaurant. 

This location is great because when waiting 3+ hrs you can walk around REI or stare at shooting water in the southside works while you wait. There's a lot of great shops to meander around while trying to kill time. A con, however, is they still use the taser-looking bricks instead of texting you. (You guys should fix that.) 

Inside decor. Lavish. Unique. Kind of gaudy. But I like it. Honestly, you look up and wonder if you're in the Sistine Chapel. Brilliant. Who paints that? And more importantly, you cannot help but wonder if your booth is housing a dinosaur egg or if youre eating under the menacing eye of Saruman (if you have no clue what I'm taking about, you cannot unsee it when you do.) 

Both options are exciting. 

A part of me truly judges the person who says they don't like The Cheesecake Factory. Why? Saying you don't like The Cheesecake Factory is like saying you don't like food - because the menu covers every discipline of food making. Honestly, the thing is an encyclopedia. If you are indecisive, you need to look at the menu and have a game plan before entering. Otherwise, you will be there all night just trying to decide. If you don't know what to get, I suggest one of two options (and really both if you're me). 

1. Order the Crusted Chicken Romano. It may not be the most adventurous option, but I am willing to say it is the best. Delicious. Massive. Caloric. 

2. Just keep eating the refillable bread baskets. They serve a wheat that is to die for. *Lifehack: when the bowl of butter comes out, grab two of those packets and place one behind each knee - otherwise you might as well try to spread a hardened slab of concrete on your bread. 

If you can eat all your food, you may want to (scratch that), always order Cheesecake. They're all good and there are about 7,000 options. I love the raspberry white chocolate, and I usually order it to go. 

Southside parking on the street is free at random times, so make sure you check the meters. If you don't mind walking a couple blocks, Sarah St. will save you from paying for parking if you are crazy about that like I am. If you're not, they have multiple parking garages in the area AND a valet (they used to even validate parking garage tickets, so look into that!). 

Cheesecake Factory... quantity, quantity, good quality, and always an experience. Check. It. Out."}
{"text":"I confess...I get jittery and awkward inside when I start reviewing chains on here.  *ducks*

This is simply a review for the happy hour.  Since 2 nights ago we spent over $18 wasting money at China Tango across the street on soup and bad beef, I felt it relevant to tell the yelp world that Cheesecake Factory has a decent happy hour.

The bad: It is from 4-6 PM.  This was the one day in 2 years of living near CF that Eric R. and I both were home before 6.  He was on the phone with a friend from 5:15-5:45 when I finally asked \"happy hour or not?!?!?\"

We got there at 5:47 and our bartender Sam was cool and patient with Eric (he gets grumpy when hungry and wanted bread and a BIG water glass.  He says CF discriminates against water drinkers because my iced tea glass can eat his water glass).

With a big debate between 2 or 3 appetizers, Sam assured us they, unlike the evil elephant bar, give FULL appetizer portions for the $5 price.  We ordered 3: chicken potstickers, shrimp summer rolls, and tamale corn cakes sans sour cream.  Full portions they were.  Lots of food, multiple dishes, and my tea = $18.  Nyah Nyah, China Tango!

Therefore, when hungry near CF before 6 PM, meander to the bar area and have yourself a hearty meal at the hour of our grandparents.  There are deals on drinks too."}
{"text":"All you are in need of a good happy hour with decent food, good drinks and Brittney (our waitress). She's what made this happy hour experience 5 stars! According to her she's always there in the bar area...so if you want 5 star service and a good happy hour experience...give Brittney your tip money...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh Waterfront, White Flint Mall, and at Arundel Mills Mall. All are tasty. Their menu is extensive and they are consistent. I particularly like their chicken samosas and asian sesame potstickers. I can vouch for their spaghetti as well. This is one of the few restaurants you will go to with a menu that shares shepherd's pie and sushi. I like their raspberry lemonade."}
{"text":"It is always a good sign to see a packed restaurant, even if you have to wait a little bit to get seats. Packed=popular, which means they must be doing something right. Our server was fantastic, who clearly knew the menu front and back and could make recommendations. 

The complimentary bread is great, but don't fill up too much on the bread! Otherwise you can't enjoy the main entree as much! I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which was not overly spicy. It could have benefited from a bit more spice, but that is my personal preference. 

The only thing preventing me from coming here frequently is the price. Otherwise, I would!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory but this is the worst one I've ever been to. My fiancé and I were both disappointed in our meals.  His was so bad he had to send it back! I always get the chicken Romano and it was just not up to par at this location.  The only reason they get 2 stars instead of one is because there wasn't a wait,  the server was nice and the cheesecake was good.  My fiancé made me promise him that he never has to go to another cheesecake factory again after this experience.  I'll probably go back without him but certainly not to this location.  Do yourself a favor and go to a different one."}
{"text":"I just discovered The Cheesecake Factory this year. If it weren't so expensive, I would go way more often!  I love it. This was our first time at this location, and it was great. We went around 6:30 on Saturday night and were seated in around 10 minutes. It was very busy, but our waiter was attentive and friendly. I could give 5 stars for the drink called the Georgia peach alone. It tastes like a drink from Carnival cruise ships called kiss on the lips. I have spent like 10 years trying to replicate it and can't. Now, I have somewhere to get it. It is $11 which is steep for a frozen drink, but oh my wow!!  The bread they serve is amazing. The sourdough is perfect. My husband had steak, I had the crusted chicken Romano, and my son had a quesadilla. Everything was great!  Now for the cheesecake....holy mother of choices. How do you decide on just one?!  My son (who is 6) always has Linda's fudge cake. It takes him 3 days to eat it because the slice is about as big as him. My hubby got the red velvet and that will be my choice next time because it was soooo good. I had the white chocolate macadamia nut and it wasn't bad. It's the only complaint if you can even call it that, but my piece of cheesecake was really small. The slices are always huge and mine was half the normal size. Maybe it was the last slice or whatever. Regardless, wonderful experience. Great food. Left stuffed. Go there."}
{"text":"Came here with my Lobster (Friends reference) and she thought it would be cool to come here for happy hour. I didn't know they had a happy hour and boy was I pleased. Cheap beers, cheap appetizers, and great service. Our server Damon was the best, funny and great with not only us but his other tables that I noticed. 

Making this my regular happy hour spot. Especially with those Mac & Cheese balls.  They were BAWWWLINNNN'!!

Best service ever and keep it up.

From your boy,

The Yelp Sheriff!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have to admit that we eat the cheesecake more often then the food, but isn't that what the place is named after? My two favorite flavors are Pineapple upside down cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake. I love that there are a ton of creative flavors and you aren't stuck with the boring East Coast Mentality of... plain cheesecake with cherry filling on top, its the only way because it tradition! (they do that have that one too) 

As for this location, we like to sit at the bar. Its always easy to walk in and get a seat at the bar even when the place is packed. We find the bartenders full of life and very friendly. An important detail for me is that my drink is never empty... its just a good sign that your server is on the ball."}
{"text":"Come for the cheesecake and stay for...well, the cheesecake.

We ate at The Cheesecake Factory one busy Saturday evening.  The wait was an hour, which was really no biggie because, hey, you've got a huge mall behind TCF to browse through!  I was thinking to myself, \"This place is so crowded it HAS to be good, right?\"  WRONG!  From the perpetually pissy server to the horrible main dishes, this was one of the worst experiences we ever had at a restaurant, bar none.  The only thing that WAS good was the thing they are famous for, the cheesecake.  Of course none of us found that out until hours later; the food had made us all so sick we had to take our cheesecakes to go!  Next time I waste my time coming to this place I'll know to grab my cheesecake and RUN!  Run far, run fast!  Mickey D's has the food at this place beat.  The ONLY thing that got stars was the deliciousness of dessert.  The service and food both get a big, fat ZERO!"}
{"text":"Its not cheap.
Its not health-friendly.
Its not ideal for vegetarians.

So if you're budget-minded, health-conscious, or a vegetarian...this isn't the place for you.

That being said, I love this place.  Sure the waits on Saturday nights suck, but that's how it is any place you might venture into unless its a little known gem.  But for me, the wait is completely worth it.  I eat whatever the heck I wanna eat, no matter how much heavy cream is in the sauce or how much sugar is in the desert or how much fried is in the fried whatever.  And yeah, I pay for it around the midsection but hey.

Anyhow, the service has always been good, even close to closing time.   Bad service once in awhile is inevitable, and I'm sure I'll receive it here sooner or later, but so far we've been fortunate.  Whether we have a large party or just a couple of us, our food has come out in a timely manner each visit.  And none of us have had cold dishes.
One of my cousins even changed her order after she got the first one and didn't like it...the waitress didn't even skip a beat.

So far, I've had mostly pasta/rice dishes.  My favorite dish here at the moment is the something something Gumbo.  Its oddly rich and subtle at the same time, the kind of thing that makes you keep shoveling forkfulls in your mouth just to delight at this combo.  The sauce is creamy but not too heavy with just enough kick.  Like I said its subtle, but at the same time its a great flavor experience.
Other dishes I've tried are the New Orleans shrimp something or another, and another cajun type dish.  Both were extremely tasty with HUGE shrimp, pieces of sausage or chicken or whatever was in it.  

They DO NOT skimp on the portions.  I've read that some people are actually turned off by this.  I just think that if I'm paying money to eat, I should get as much for that money as possible.  And here, you do.  Last night, we commented on how a dish that costs only $13 could be chocked full of so many big fresh shrimp.  And recently, one of the kids and his dad ordered one of the burgers...this thing was a friggin' MONSTER!  It could eat a human.  And sure it would make any health-conscious person run for the hills, but for the rest of us, this burger would make your eyes get so big your eyeballs might fall out of their sockets.  Let's just say Red Robin's burgers look like White Castles compared to this.  Sadly, this specific burger is no longer on the menu, and to custom do it, they would've charged extra.  So that wasn't cool.

And I think that is the only negative point I might have.  Seriously, I love this place.  Its only got 4 stars cause its not somewhere I can just up and say \"let's go!\" because of the prices.  Well......let's rethink that.  See, I HAVE to have cheesecake.  After all, it IS the Cheesecake Factory.  Its their defining thingy.  And cheesecake (plus a beverage) is what really rolls my bill over the line.  But is the cheesecake all that???  Oh my friggin goodness, yes.

I cannot speak for all the cheesecakes on the extensive menu, for I simply cannot get past the Banana whatever cheesecake.  This is just the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth.  I won't attempt to describe it, just know that if you like anything to do with bananas, this is for you.  You two were meant to meet.  Destiny.

And about that extensive menu...yeah its big.  Soooo many choices.  They've got pastas, rice dishes, platters, burgers, steaks, seafoods, pizzas (the littlest in our fam ordered a pizza and it was 2 times as big as his head)...and then of course all the appetizers, drinks, and deserts.  I don't know why someone would ever complain about a big menu.  That's beyond me.

So what else?  Uhm, its a good place for a date...although I must say there seems to be so many complete hotties here at any given time, that some unfortunate glances my inevitably happen....so be warned fellas.  I suggest you wear sunglasses.
Uhm, the bathrooms were clean each time I went.  Although this last time there was a big line....with food this rich, that is to be expected.  
Atmosphere is enjoyable.  Some people may think its a little uppity, but coming from a guy who wears jeans and a t-shirt most days, I'd have to say its ok.  A lot of the teen crowd and early 20s, but its not an obnoxious atmosphere at all.  Its a family place.

So...yeah.  If you can stand to spend about 20 bucks a person, don't care about the calories, and want some really good food and a lot of it, come."}
{"text":"We went by last night to give this location another try and it was not a good experience, in fact it was worse. I handed our waiter, David N., the letter which still had the gift card attached to it (you guys sent us a $45 gift card to give you another try). In the letter it states that the manager would like to know we are there and they could make sure our experience was a better one and would like to meet us. This did not happen, the waiter stood there and read the letter so I don't know if it was waiter who did not inform management or they just didn't want to come out, but we were never approached by any manager.
  We ordered the eggroll sampler and it was just put in front of us with no explanation of the sauces (never have we ordered any of the eggrolls). We had to go back through the menu to read the individual eggroll descriptions to try and figure this out the sauces but I still don't think we got it right. Now, of course this isn't the biggest deal so we just let it go.
 My friend ordered the grilled fish tacos with no marinated onions and instead cooked onions with no chipotle sauce (she's very sensitive to heat) and to have that replaced with your creama (from the \"slim\" menu). She received her dinner and there was no creama, just chipIotle sauce, a very minimal amount of grilled onions (a taco had ONE small strip) ZERO avocado (as it states on the menu its served with it)  and somehow there was a pickled cabbage?? (it's not stated thats on the tacos on the menu) We asked the server if they could remake it and at this point we are getting very frustrated with the service and food. I had to ask for my coke and her water to be refilled MANY times despite the waiter always walking around. I was genuinely flabbergasted I had to ask for refills with how much he was walking by.
 So, by now, after already a long wait to receive our food to begin with (the restaurant was not busy by any means from what we could tell) we had to wait another 15 minutes for her food to be remade, so my boyfriend and I stopped eating out of courtesy.  45 mins after we ordered our food, we FINALLY got to eat together and of course my boyfriends and I's dinner was cold. My friend STILL then had a problem with her order (the tortillas were not cooked) but by then we were so hungry we didnt say anything.
 Now, here comes the time to pay. After the waiter took the $45 gift card off the total, the remaining balance of the bill was $42 and change. I only had twenties and my friend had her debit card. So, we told the waiter for $20.00 on the card and I put down two twenty dollar bills. David, our waiter, brought back the receipts with no change! Never EVER had I had a waiter just assume the remaining change was theirs and pocket my cash. He never asked if we needed change to verify it was his, he just took it! I asked for it back and he mumbled an apology about be busy or whatnot (which none of us believed, he was making excuses all night and the place WASN'T busy). 
For this trying to be a make-up from last time for the burnt food and bad food, you guys SERIOUSLY missed again. I don't know if it's this location or whatever but we are very unsatisfied with the service and food and that the manager wasn't around to make sure our dining experience was better than the last. I really enjoyed you guys, but at this rate my friend says she NEVER wants to come back and I don't blame her!!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the restaurant.  They need to educate the wait staff as to what celiac disease really is. I was excited they had several items listed as gluten free.  I told the waitress I had celiac and needed to be gluten free.  I ordered a burger with GF bun. Needless to say I took a bit and noticed right away that it was not.! Ask her if it was she replied no I guess not. Do you want me to bring a piece of bread to put your burger on?. Really. I fault management.  These people should be told . This is not a just for fun diet choice for me but a health issue. If you advertise gluten free that is what you should do. Anybody with celiac should not trust this place."}
{"text":"To be honest with everyone here,  The Cheesecake Factory Sucks. I don't mind eating there but where is the personal style, the flair.  i remember how everyone always loves to go to the Cheesecake Factory for a romantic dinner.  COME ON....  the only romantic things about this is helping your mate eat the Snickers Cheesecake after you take it home.    Overall I would only really go to Cheesecake factory to pick up a dessert. HENCE THE NAME"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has to be my favorite restaurant ever. It is the perfect place for any occasion. 

My favorite things about this restaurant is how it is dimly lit. It adds a more intimate atmosphere and makes the room feel more luxurious. The music they play definitely makes the experience a lot better. It can be quite busy every night as it is perfect for a casual dinner or more special dinner. The servers have always been great and very friendly! 

The menu offers you so many different choices. My personal favorites is the fried calamari for appetizer, of course the delicious complimentary bread basket, the herb crusted salmon and mashed potatoes with asparagus and a lemon sauce, I made the mistake of switching it up one night and got a rice dish, nothing compares to the salmon, then finish it off with, of course, cheesecake! The classic strawberry cheesecake is not too sweet and fresh, but still satisfying for any sweet tooth. 

I was always come back and have had great memories every single visit."}
{"text":"We all had huge burgers ! I had the mushroom Swiss burger with grilled bun! Perfectly cooked medium well! 
I ordered salad with balsamic vinaigrette instead of fries. Salad was very good & large portion. 2 kinds of bread with butter served before meal. Wheat is soft & warm & is the best. Great service & meal on a Saturday with no wait for a table! Everyone loved their meal!"}
{"text":"Ate here for a late lunch.  Waited about 10 mins for a table.  Service was a little slow to start but our server quickly picked up the pace.  Fried mac-n-cheese balls were amazing as was the Parmesan cheese bread.  We also had a slice of cherry cheesecake and a slice of banana cream cheesecake.  Both were delicious."}
{"text":"This star is just for the food!! Were do I begin as this is now the second time in 2 weeks this restaurant has lackluster performance and pisspoor service overall. Tonight there appeared to be 3 managers that seem to know more about the socore of the football game than the entire bar of customers complaining loud and long for service. We waited 10 minutes and asked several people for a waiter then finally interuped another waiter to get us one. We waited 25 minutes for our food only to not get checked on or asked if we wanted cheese on our pasta. We, listened to one table give up on cheesecake and another beside us in a debate to not tip!! There was an abundance of staff but unorganized and mismanaged period. This particular restaurant seems to lack prompt let alone any type of attention to its customers that pay sizable price to wait for great food at a high level of agravation to get it!!"}
{"text":"It's the Cheesecake Factory which is a good thing bc I've been to many from this location to Los Angeles, TX, GA, VA, FL and they are consistently the same.  Portions are ginormous.  Wife got the meatloaf which had 3 slices easily weighing over 1lb so 2 slices went in the doggie bag for...the dogs!   I got the fish tacos which were ehh, if you've had them in SoCal none can compare.  We also got the blueberry cheese cake to go and that was pretty good also. 

Why 3 stars?   Nothing wrong with our experience but nothing great.  If you've been to one and want to go back it's a sure bet, it's a chain restaurant with no true authenticity, but a menu the same length of a Harry Potter novel so everyone can be pleased for their meal."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout the other night cobb salad (feta instead of blue cheese) and the vanilla bean cheesecake. Salad was fresh, shredded lettuce, crispy bacon, delicious vinaigrette, and huge! 
Cheese cake was amazing! Vanilla bean muse added a creamy not too sweet touch of phenomenal! 

Had not eaten at Cheesecake in years because I am not big on chain restaurants, but was impressed and excited to return!"}
{"text":"It's always a treat to go and eat here. This past week I was there twice once for lunch and a early dinner. What I truly appreciate about this restaurant is the portion sizes are substantial no matter what time a day you decide to eat there. I've been there for brunch and still had left overs. Dinner was again exceptional!"}
{"text":"The line up and wait is ludicrous and as a matter of fact, the food that we ordered was not worth the line. The chicken madeira was way too salty while the steak dianne lacked seasoning. The servers, however, were extremely nice and welcoming. 

The next day, I ordered a 7\" original cheesecake with a plaque that was supposed to say \"happy birthday buba\". After a quick drive home (10 minutes max) it was completely ruined. So that was a let down. 

Another incident was when i ordered a Godiva brownie on doordash and the order was made completely wrong. It had come with only one whipped cream and once ice cream in a to go cup with 3 cups pf glazed strawberries along side the brownies. Last time I checked there were supposed to be two cups of icecream and whipped cream and no strawberries?"}
{"text":"I only give it 4 stars because I ordered a catering for 12 people and it was 20 minutes late. Food is typical Cheesecake Factory - very good just beware if you cater to order with plenty of time to spare."}

I love how you're sitting outside but its actually not outside. the food is amazing & service is great. I'm always willing to try new things, & the server always gives me great recommendations. Red velvet cheesecake for desert is a must for me.. the best part, I can walk around the forum shops in ceasar palace, that helps me to digest LOL .."}
{"text":"Food is on par with all other Cheesecake Factory locations.

Take out counter is staffed by incompetents. Three times in one week I had to go back and return my order because it was either missing something or it was made wrong.

Once is a mistake. Twice is a wake up call to management. Three times is inexcusable. 

And that's me. I live next door. 

Imagine the people who drive home 4 miles and find out they've been screwed and never even complain."}
{"text":"Every Cheesecake Factory will have the same quality food, but the service will greatly vary.  I placed an order for a cheesecake for someone's birthday at work several days in advance.  I told them my name, my order, and specifically requested that the cake be ready by 11:30 A.M. on the pick up date.  When I came at 11:30 to pick up my cake, they did not have my name on any order, and they did not have any whole cakes defrosted.  The cashier took my order right there and gave me the requested cake, but then proceeded to ask me \"Are you going to eat this cake right now?\"  Telling her that our party was at noon, she proceeded to tell me \"You are going to have to wait 1.5 hours for the cake to defrost.\"  What??  She did add in a quick \"Sorry\" but in that \"Sorry, but deal with it\" tone.  Due to this location's poor planning and bad customer service, we were unable to have the cake for the lunch party.  Since we were at work, we could not wait 1.5 hours for it to defrost since we only had a small block of time to serve it and eat.  I'm never getting anything from this location again, and if you get anything to go, I'd be wary of ordering any whole cakes from them."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in years. Usually if I want to eat out I'll go somewhere that's locally/independently owned but I had a gift card that had been sitting around gathering dust so I wanted to use it before I lost or misplaced it.

I ordered from the to-go/dessert counter. The cashier was friendly and professional. He was very nice and offered a beverage (Water, iced tea, or soda) for me to sip on while I waited for my meal. He packaged my order very well and I was on my way in about 15 minutes.

I had the lunch portion of herb crusted salmon and a carrot cake cheesecake. The lunch portion was huge. The salmon was tender, the asparagus was cooked al dente, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with some lumps of potato and some skin. My meal also came with a foil wrapped portion of bread with several pats of butter- nice! The cheesecake was your typical Cheesecake Factory quality. It was creamy, a good amount of sweetness, with a nice integration of carrot cake and cheesecake. I shudder to think of the amount of cardio I'll have to do to burn the amount of calories I just ate!

My total for the lunch portion salmon and the cheesecake was slightly less than $25. Overall no surprises for the actual taste of the food, but service was top notch."}
{"text":"Went here for a holiday dinner with a large party, and the person who organized the dinner made reservations in advance, and planned out a pre-set menu with limited options to make ordering and food preparation easier.  So, our meals should have been prepared without a hitch, right?  

Unfortunately, despite adequate and friendly service, the kitchen was a mess.  They messed up several of our orders, which needed to be taken back and prepared again.  Orders came out at staggered times, with a very long wait in between.  It took forever just to actually get the first meal to our table, with nothing to satiate our hunger but some meager pieces of bread.  When the meals came out, the food itself was your standard Cheesecake Factory food, with big portions (and big calories!) but quite tasty as a result.  We had some lemoncello torte and chocolate coconut cream cheesecake which were both delicious.  I'd say the highlight of the restaurant is naturally their cheesecake, so if you are in this area and are wanting to eat here I'd recommend:  1.  Not going with a large party, or 2. Getting your food to go."}
{"text":"Reasons why this place is crap: 
1. The hibachi steak, is not really a steak. It is actually pieces of over cooked steak, that they dumped soy sauce on after it was cooked. The bean sprouts are probably from LaChoy, and the mushrooms.....I'm not sure what was going on there. 
2. The water is served in plastic glasses. 
3. Beer selection sucks. 
4. There are light up vaginas on the ends of all the outer booths. 
5. The service sucks. 
6. The food is overpriced for the quality. *quantity does not equal quality 
7. Ads inside a menu are in very poor taste. 
8. The music is really loud for a restaurant. 
However, the Key Lime Cheesecake is amazing."}
{"text":"I came for the cheesecake, which is always good. I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. Excellent, but very rich. I ordered a hot chocolate, which in hindsight was maybe too much chocolate (if that's possible). One thing I didn't like was the presentation of the drink - typically you would expect to see hot chocolate in a mug, but this was a glass cup with two straws. To the passerbye it would appear to be chocolate milk. A little weird to me...

The service was good and the cheesecake was excellent. $6.50 per slice, but well worth it."}
{"text":"always good!!!
portions are huge. my friend order a cobb salad and it was enormous. i had a delicious turkey sandwich... it is definitely a spot to go when you get sick of the buffets."}
{"text":"Although the wait was a little long  the skinnylicious shrimp pasta was perfect and portioned appropriately. 
Drinks were replenished consistently throughout the meal.
In addition , the others in my party ordered the enchiladas.. which were authentic to the taste 
and the pot pie was amazing.

Despite the wait..it's a great place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a Cheesecake Factory, and I was impressed! I was just by myself, but I ordered the hot spinach and cheese dip as my appetizer and it was enough to feed 2 people. I had the fresh Grilled Salmon for my entree, that came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. This dish was equally as delicious. For dessert I, of course had cheesecake, which is obviously a signature menu item for the Cheesecake Factory, and one of my personal favorite desserts. I ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake, is wow! was this delicious! I love cheese cake, and Oreos, and this was great!

All of the dishes where well priced, and she sizes of the dishes were huge, and definitely enough to feed two people. I ended up taking some leftovers from each dish home with me.

My waitress, Heidi was nice, and was there when I needed her. When it was time or me to go, she put my leftovers in take-home containers and presented my with my bill.

I certainly enjoyed coming here to eat, and will dine here again!"}
{"text":"I go here frequently because I love that they have a lot on their menu to satisfy whatever I'm craving. That said I'm normally wowed by it. The last time I went there for my birthday I liked everything the only thing that happened is they gave my mom the wrong food. Other than that very nice. I love how fancy it is and I actually happen to know the last that painted everything in there! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Why go to the Cheesecake Factory? I mean does it really have something that special on its menu that is worth the trek or the wait for a table? No, it doesn't have the charm and the allure but it does offer a wide ranging menu that is sure to please, decent service, and most off all: consistency. 

The menu is overwhelmingly large. Whether you want appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, entrees, or more they will have it. Tacos? Shepherd's Pie? Chicken Milenese? Yes, they have it available on their menu. While it won't be the greatest you ever had, it certainly won't be disappointing and offers decent flavors. 

Service was good and like other locations, its saving grace. We were the last party to be seated and they didn't hesitate to be of service nor did they try to rush us. They were attentive and water glasses never went empty. The food arrived in a well timed orchestration and was where the restaurant clearly shined.

All in all it was consistent. It stayed true to the Cheesecake Factory experience and didn't disappoint, yet at the same time didn't wow either."}
{"text":"Great place to eat no matter what you are in the mood for. The menu selection is huge and we have not been let down by any dish we have ordered. It is clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This review is based on take out:

When you call in to place a take our order, they don't give you the proper/correct time for your order to be ready.

I placed a take out order three times since this location opened and all three times I had to wait.

On one occasion I swore they placed the order as I got there like they forgot to put it in as I watched her pushed her buttons on her screen as she reread my order to confirm.  She then proceeded to give me my lemonade I ordered while I waited another 30 minutes (total of 1 hour wait since I ordered) for my food to arrive.

I'm sure a lot of mall employees that orders food from here are on a timed lunch so it is very imperative they get their shit together."}
{"text":"Overpriced but a good place to meet friends because it looks nice inside. They offer good variety of menu. Friendly service and it can be packed during dinner and weekends"}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food. The menu can be daunting, but my family has been there enough times that we typically order the same items (Steak Medallions, Chicken Madeira, and Meatloaf). We did try the Chicken Lettuce wraps this time and they were delicious!! (Reminded me of a mini Bahn Mi in a lettuce cup. Yum!)  

We used the new Cheesecake Factory app on our iPhones to track our food as we ordered and used it to for payment, too. We didn't have to wait for a check and didn't need to pass around our credit/debit card either. It was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake is never disappointing. We went today for lunch, my boyfriend and I. We decided to split a small appetizer and then split a chicken parm sandwich. I placed the order, and the waitress asked if we wanted salad or fries, I said fries. Then the BF decides he wants to be the boss of the relationship and ordered salad. Ha, he is just so funny. So when the waitress passed back by I said can please have the salad and a side of fries. She said, \"I was gonna bring you some fries anyways\". What a great waitress she was. She was very good at keeping our ice teas full and kept us stocked on ice too. It was once again, Another great experience at Cheesecake Factory. I love this place! A bit pricey if you dont split the orders but its always a good meal! Love it!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was really slow.... and it was not busy.
lots a waitors walking around. horseplaying. 
only saw our waitress twice. 
one to take our order and the other to take our money. lol

ordered the lunch special: pizza and salad
both big portions.
could not finish
both really good."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak diane,  came in four little steak pieces,  which I thought was weird, I've never seen a steak come out in anything other than one whole piece. I ordered it medium well, and the first, thickest piece I cut into was borderline medium rare. The other, thinner pieces were also medium. I told my waitress and she took my whole plate - mashed potatoes and shrimp scampi,  back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, my boyfriend finished his pasta meal. The steak finally came back and there were only 3 pieces of steak this time!  The thickest one was missing.  I complained to the manager, Stacy, who was very understanding and offered to get me another piece of steak. I declined because it really didn't matter at that point... She did give us a free dessert and the flavor of the sauce over the steak was good. Otherwise, I've always had good service and food here!"}
{"text":"We needed something at the mall and thought we'd try it! They only have 3-4 beers on tap, kilt lifter, Stella & Blue moon. We ordered crab bites as a appetizer. While they were small (6)  they packed awesome melt in your mouth flavor! I ordered the bistro shrimp pasta. It was so delicious. The portion size is so huge that it also fed my son & I lunch the next day! My husband ordered Cajun jambalaya extra spicy and boy the delivered on his request! It was extra spicy!  We ordered Seasonal pumpkin/pecan cheesecake to go and it was nothing short of amazing!  Our service was excellent and we will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"The strawberry cheesecake tasted like someone decided to freeze old strawberries and then put them on top of a cheesecake slice that had been sitting in a cooler for a week. The avocado toast was toasted so much, not even the world's sharpest knife could penetrate it. The coca-cola tasted how it should though and although the service was slow, the people were nice."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this particular Cheesecake Factory, other than I was just there last night.  The food is good as expected.  Their Mojitos are also very good.  I tried all four - regular, pomegranate, passionfruit, and pineapple - and have to say the pomegranate is my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends, had the shrimp scampi and steak Diane, firecracker salmon for appetizer. 

Very good steak, medium rare like I ordered. Firecracker salmon was nothing special, good to try but I don't think I'll order it again.

The shrimp scampi was good.

All in all would I come here for dinner again, maybe, but I'll definitely come here for the ambiance and oh let's not forget the cheesecake. 

The best ever!!"}
{"text":"We don't visit CKF very often, simply because it's very overpriced and crowded.  I do love their Chicken Piccata and macaroni cheese bites though.  They have a very large menu....at times overwhelming."}
{"text":"Wonderful as always! Love the menu though it can be overwhelming! I have so many favorites though! I enjoy the patio seating... great view of the mall & warm heaters (for winter). I got the Thai coconut chicken last night, it was incredible! My hubby loves the orange chicken! The chicken tacos & nachos are also favorites!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo, but when my plate arrived the pasta and sauce were lukewarm and the pasta was clumped together. It was clear that it was not freshly made. I asked the waiter to re-make it, which they did."}
{"text":"One of the more dependable chain restaurants.  It feels like a treat without spending huge amounts for a tasty meal.

I've always enjoyed their great food and good portion sizes.  Many items are generous enough to be shared.  The giant menu allows everyone to find something that they like.  If you have any room left after your meal you can share a slice of cheesecake or take one to go!

We visit both this location and the one at the Biltmore often and both are nice.  Even though the restaurant is quite large, there can still be a wait.  So reservations or call-ahead dining would be a nice addition.

Here are some of my favorites from their menu - it's always hard to choose just one.
Luau Salad http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/menu/Salads/luau_salad
Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich 
Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta
Low Carb Cheesecake is delicious too!  They use crushed walnuts instead of graham crackers for the crust.

I've rarely ordered something that I didn't love."}
{"text":"The best service/wait staff in conjunction with an excellent menu selection, truly better than all competitors on Bell Rd."}
{"text":"Service is always great, I've been visiting this location for years.  Food is always great as well, I love the chicken avocado club, yesterday I tried the fish and chips and it was delicious.  I also love the drink menu, the pomegranate mojito is top notch.

My only complaint is when this place gets busy it seems to fall apart a bit up front.  Hostesses become distracted and spend more time talking to each other and trying to figure things out then getting people seated."}
{"text":"Just has a hamburger and it was terrible. No flavor at all. I didn't even finish half of it as it was so bad.
I'm sure the other food is good, but DON'T get a hamburger. Way over priced!

I did let the waitress know about the hamburger, but she didn't offer to make it right. I even wrote it on the receipt."}
{"text":"Very delicious and big portions and great cheesecake and the service is fantastic and it's a beautiful restaurant and very lively"}
{"text":"This restaurant experience was not that great. First I had to wait 10 minutes to get seated. After I got seated, it was another 10 minutes before someone asked me if I wanted water or anything. 

The spot they put me in was way too noisy and I asked to sit in the patio. Nice view out there, but then again another 10 minutes to get my order.

The food in my option wasn't all that great.  I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"2 hour wait to get a buzzer + 1.5 hour wait after you get your buzzer. When you do finally have a chance to get in, the menu is quite impressive. A lot of options for food, although 90% of it is chicken. And somehow they ran out of the chicken entree that I wanted which confused me...because I'm not sure what they ran out of. Unless the chef just didn't want to make it anymore....or their entrees are premade and frozen.

The cheesecake options are also huge, but the quality isn't mind blowing for the price you have to pay. Averages meal is about $20 and slice of cheesecake is $10."}
{"text":"Awful. Waiter had no clue. Food took 2 hours and was delivered cold. Stay away. This place is awful."}
{"text":"Hello everyone!!! I just want to say that if you want a truly amazing dining experience, eat at this cheesecake factory location!! I'd recommend the Alfredo or steak tacos! The chocolate cheesecake is creamy and perfect as well! To top all of this off, the staff is gorgeous and super friendly!"}
{"text":"I read a lot of the positive reviews of their cheese cakes. So I decided to have a light dinner. It was a pretty busy nite, and I decided to park myself at the bar.
I  first order a cosmopolitan drink. Then I decided to order the sweet corn tamale cakes. In about 15 minutes my order came. The tamale cakes were topped with sour cream, salsa, cilantros, avocado, and salsa verde. It was very delicious and filling.
I decided to order key lime cheese cake for take-out. I couldn't wait till I got home to tryout the cheesecake. When I got home I savored the key lime cheesecake flavor. And I was not disappointed. Next time
I will try out there hamburger combo and a different cheesecake. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came in around 9:50 pm and it was a short wait to get seated thankfully. We ordered our food quickly but the food didn't come out for 20 minutes. We finished our bread and asked for more while waiting but the bread never came until we already had our food and had to ask a busser boy because our waitress was too busy or something. 

I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos. worst decision ever! The tortillas were very doughey and the rice had barely any taste. So i traded my brother for his Fettucine Alfredo because he didn't like it and you can never going wrong with that right? Wrong! The chicken had zero seasoning along with the pasta in general.

Everyone at my table had something wrong with their food, from hard spinach to doughey pizza. 

At the time we got our food it was too late to even ask for them to remake it since they close at 11 pm! Plus we were starving. 

The only thing that convinced me to give CCF 2 stars is how friendly the hostess was!"}
{"text":"Yummy, huge portions, and fantastic service. It's a little pricey, but not too bad. The waitress brought us a special slice of wedding cheesecake adorned with candles. Very sweet."}
{"text":"1 star for the dirty restrooms. Some photos I took are tasteless to post, but the ones I am posting will suffice."}
{"text":"My, oh my, oh my. What has happened to the Cheesecake Factory? Not that it was anything really special before, but it was at least always dependable. Good fresh HUGE salads and great cheesecake. Well, the salads are still huge, but that's about all I can say for the them. And the cheesecake? I wouldn't know. Suddenly, the flourless Godiva chocolate cheesecake is no longer gluten-free. What happened???!!! 

I ordered the Santa Fe salad, which I've had before and enjoyed, and got something not even resembling what used to be. The chicken is either chicken lunchmeat or they now shaaaave it so thin it can't be found OR tasted. The cheese was skimpy, the corn was almost nonexistent....there was LOTS of lettuce...oh, and one tomato quarter. Why bother? 

One of my dining companions ordered the Cobb salad. She had the same experience with skimpiness of ingredients. Where was the bleu cheese? She could barely identify any bacon pieces. There were TONS of hardboiled egg crumbles surrounding the plate, but nothing much else that should have been there....again, LOTS of lettuce. Oh, and the dressing was not discernible at all. After asking about the bleu cheese and dressing, the water brought over a small bowl of extra (?) bleu cheese and a small pitcher of dressing. 

The restaurant was not crowded at all, the service was slow and spotty. All in all, the three of us wouldn't bother going back again. No loss.  Not only that, we each had to pay $5 to park????  And there's nothing at Southside Works anymore anyway."}
{"text":"This is the busiest Cheesecake Factory in their corporation and thats because its in such a great place: its right in the middle of the Caesar's Forum Shops. It also happens to be next to a Nike Town and a Virgin Megastore. Not to mention, a really huge and cool aquarium. I like coming here after a long day of wasting money at Caesar's. Also, I think the Cajun Rib-eye is the best kept secret in the business. Why? Its better than an outback porterhouse, by far, its not too expensive, and it has a huge serving size. They marinate these behemoths for at least 24hrs and in the end you wind up with a huge, juicy, tender steak broiled not too badly. YUMM."}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake factory but the service here left a bad taste in my mouth. My dad gave me Cheesecake factory gift cards so I went with my mom and my two brothers for dinner. I walked to reserve a table because the parking can get a bit crazy around dinner time.I walked to the Hostess and told her that I would like to reserve a table for four, She then had asked me my name and she must have had a hard time hearing me because after I said it she said \"What was your name?!\" Spot on shitty attitude for a hostess. I then asked her if she could check how much money was on the cards my dad gave me for Christmas and she said \"well I can't check that over here but if you wanna go over there they can check for you\" with an even shittier attitude. I then went over to the counter where they could check the credit of my gift cards and the man who checked them was cool unlike his boogie ass co worker of a host. I didn't have to wait that long to be seated which was nice. Our waiter on the other hand was acting like there was a bomb tied to her waist that would explode if she didn't do her job. I could tell in her voice that she didn't wanna be there which made it awkward for me and my family. On the other hand the food was really good. I'm gonna come back again just with high hopes I don't come across that same waitress or that hostess, except for that other guy he was cool as fuck."}
{"text":"So I decided to get Cheesecake Factory for lunch on my break, I order ahead of time they said my order would be ready by 12:36pm. I got to Cheesecake Factory on time, I had called the number for curbside pickup I had got transferred to the bakery no one had answered. I then called right back a guy named Kyle answered he asked for my name I gave him my name he said my order was not ready yet because they just got 4 togo orders. I waited like 15 mins it being like 12:50pm telling them I still have not got my food Kyle answered again & said that he would personally bring out my food. Another 15 mins go by i still have not got my food. I then called back saying I have not got my food the lady who answered the phone said no one had told her I was here and that she would bring my food right out. I got my food around 1:15pm waited about 45 mins just hearing different answers basically just to eventually been told no one knew i was here even after I had called multiple times!!! Very bad service!! Never order curbside especially if your on a lunch break!!! If I can put 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"The place has a good ambience and is clean, but you pay for it with the overpriced menu. The service is ok. The food lacked in seasoning and something as simple as their house coffee (served lukewarm) was below average."}
{"text":"Umm, I adore the Cheesecake Factory. I'm a long time fan, and tried just about every dish on the menu. 

Imagine how thrilled I was that I found one not too far from me! This Cheesecake Factory serves your standard, fabulous dishes. Taste is always up to par. Fresh food, beautiful decor.  And, the cheesecakes are SO good!"}
{"text":"I've officially reduced my 2*s, to only 1*. 

Yes, Guest Services did \"reach out\" to me as per their response at the bottom of my original review.  I even took the extra step of emailing them with my concerns.  However, weeks later, I have yet to receive a response.

Their \"reach out\" just seems like trying to save face / look like they care.  Completely disingenuous!"}
{"text":"It's been so long since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory. Thanks babe for bringing it up. Our grey goose martinis were amazing especially with the blue cheese olives!!! The ahi tartar is just to die for! If you haven't tried the seared ahi entree or the fish tacos you are missing out!  
Friendly environment 
Even though it was busy we were sat within 5 minutes. 
Our waiter was a bit hoverish, but they still get a 5 star! 
We will be back."}
{"text":"My in-laws took us out for dinner for my wife's birthday.  Our waiter was terrible.  He was more attentive to the large table than he was to us.  We asked for stuff and never got it.  We brought this to the manager and didn't seem to care.  Love the Cheesecake but the service sucked!"}
{"text":"For a cheesecake factory restaurant I was very in displeased. The waiter didn't bring out the bread basket until we asked for it and my Cuban sandwich had roast fat instead of roast beef. This was the most discouraging meal I've had from the cheesecake factory and is not typical of their food quality or service."}
{"text":"CHEESECAKE. Cheeeeeeesecake. Who doesn't like cheesecake?! & when you add a restaurant where the servers applaud you for eating dessert before dinner, why would you NOT go? 

It wasn't my first time at this location, but it seemed like a LARGER location than the others around town. The wait was approximately 20 minutes, so my friends & I bought and ate a mango lime cheesecake first. It was tart, the ingredients perfectly blended, perfect for my sweeeet tooth. 

For dinner, we skipped the appetizers and went straight to the entres. I could use a lot of words to describe each dish, but pictures are worth more. 

Great service! Amazing food! Tons of options!"}
{"text":"Met friends for Happy Hour.  It's cold outside and there's not enough seating in the bar area and no place to hang your coats.  Prices were high.  I think I'll suggest Brio for HH next time."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to having a good meal never did I think I'd be sending my food back for a refund. Appetizers were delicious, zucchini sticks, macaroni balls, crab cakes, stuffed mushrooms and sweet corn tamale cakes satisfied my hunger. I ordered the fried cat fish...WAY to fishy not mention bland as all heck! Our server was fantastic, Mike took care of us and constantly checked in. Great service mediocre food."}
{"text":"Don't go here. 
 
1. The server took too long to take our order. 
2. We waited at least 30 minutes for our food. 
3. I don't remember the server being attentive.
4. Server disappeared toward the end of our meal and we were basically left without a server at all. Other servers brought us a refill and another took our payment. 

Environment:
1. The lights were SO dim I wasn't comfortable. I could barely see! 
2. The customers dining there that night were extremely loud and I heard profanity a good handful of times within just one hour that I was there. I felt like I was at a dive-in bar. It wasn't my usual experience like at other Cheesecake Factories. 

The food--
4. I ordered black pepper shrimp, the rice was so overcooked :( 
5. In general, my food was less than flavorful. 

Price--
WE PAID $70 for 2 of us, luckily I had a gift card to pay for part of that.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is much more than cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza. 

  Yesterday after hanging out in Sabalatte in the Boca Park Fashion Village, my brother and I were up for dinner. We decided on The Cheesecake Factory. The menu offers a diverse selection of food at competitive prices inside an upscale dining room. We couldn't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. 

  Although I have only been to this location once before way back in February of 2005 when I picked up my new Saturn Ion (sure was a long time ago), and celebrated with a delicious pasta dinner, I am no stranger to the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the Caesar's Palace location quite a few times. 

  When my brother and I stepped inside the dimly lit and elegant restaurant, it was understandably busy. The friendly hostess took our name and kindly let us know that there would be a five minute wait. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to implement the text messaging system that some restaurants have incorporated. The wait was less than five minutes. 

  Tina was our waitress. She was friendly, never rushed us, and constantly checked up on us. I am giving a shout out for Tina on account of the fact that my brother left his sunglasses at the table. As we approached the Valley parking area (on the way to the upper deck), Tina comes running after us with his sunglasses. With that said, the service here rounded up Cheesecake Factory to four stars. 

  The food is also delicious. Everytime that I have dined in a Cheesecake Factory, the large portions had filled me up leaving me with no room for cheesecake. In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant for either dinner or coffee and dessert. We just had coffee at Sabalatte, so tonight I ordered their chicken parmesan sandwich which included fries and a Coke. The chicken parmesan sandwich is unique. I don't know of many restaurants that make it. Plus, it is delicious. Between the time of ordering and Tina delivering the sandwich, she delivered the customary dinner rolls. In past visits to the Caesar's Palace Cheesecake Factory, the pasta sauce was included.  Here, there is a separate bowl of the sauce where you pour it on to your liking. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich. It is something that I do not enjoy very often. I also enjoyed the small bowl of French fries that accompanied the sandwich. And the Coke did not have a hint of flatness. It was just as sparkling as Tina's attitude. 

  Cheesecake Factory was $20 well spent. The dining area is not Tiffany elegance but an elegance similar to dining in a Caesar's Palace, Venetian Hotel, or upscale resort Cafe. It is a dining environment that isolates the outside world and is simply relaxing. The food was delicious and filling. Service was outstanding. I could see another well spent $20 at Cheesecake Factory in the future. Or $30 if I am hungry and want to reward myself with their signature cheesecake and coffee."}
{"text":"When in Rome do as the Roman's do. A popular thing to do in this Roman themed mall is to visit the Cheesecake Factory. At the Forum Shops, all roads lead to the Cheesecake Factory located where the main corridor concludes at the Journey to Atlantis Show. 

   It seems that the time I initially started visiting this Cheesecake Factory is older than the statues and columns that border this Roman themed mall. In a sense this is partially true considering that my visits go back long ago prior to the Forum Shops expansion when Virgin Records was the cool place to visit during the George W. Bush administration. Today, at the end of the Obama administration, the food and dining experience here is just as good as when George W. Bush was in office. 

   This Cheesecake Factory is usually busy. There is quite a difference waiting here than an uninteresting  place such as the DMV. Here, patrons wait in an area with the sounds and sights of Rome. Where else can you wait for dinner while watching statues above a 50,000 gallon aquarium come to life to battle it out in the \"Fall of Atlantis\"? Waiting gets even better with the signature cheesecake displays at the other side of the hostess. Waiting would be even better if there was no waiting. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to offer the texting or beeper system.

    The Cheesecake Factory is a spacious and attractive restaurant that includes tables overlooking the \"Fall of Atlantis\" show. The tables deep inside the restaurant are envoloped in an elegant interior. On the majority of my visits including the latest, we sat deep in the restaurant. 

   The Cheesecake menu is to restaurants what the nearby 50,000 gallon aquarium is to aquariums: Giantic! As soon as I saw eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta, on this visit I instantaneously bypassed around 250 other choices. Eggplant parmesan is one of my favorite dishes. I was so :-) to see it on the menu. With that said, in the past I have enjoyed commendable sandwiches including the eggplant parmesan sandwich, burgers, and a BLT. The eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta is reasonably priced at $14.95. Unlike some restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip, this is not a tourist trap. With the entree, I ordered bottomless Coke. Ahead of the dinner, the attentive waiter served us bread with butter.

  The eggplant parmesan was delicious with a capital D. The Cheesecake Factory style of serving eggplant parmesan is separate round pieces bordering pesto pasta. Every bite of the eggplant parmesan covered with mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, and marina cheese made me feel like a Roman emperor. Likewise I relished the taste of the pesto pasta. This is the first time that a restaurant served eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta. Cheesecake Factory had broke the tradition of serving eggplant parmesan with pasta under marinara sauce. Regardless, I truly enjoyed it. The dinner was so enjoyable that time went fast, and before you knew it we were leaving Rome for the Las Vegas Strip. It's just a shame that I never leave enough room for the cheesecake.

   I have been a fan of this Cheesecake Factory going back years prior to holding a smartphone when Virgin Records was the attraction. This dining environment inside a faux Ancient Rome overlooking a 50,000 gallon aquarium where statues come to life to battle it out in the \"Fall of Atlantis\" show is exclusive. The generous menu offers several choices from the cheeseburger to eggplant parmesan. The prices are reasonable. And the service has always been solid. In conclusion, Julius Caesar would be proud of the Forum Shops Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Worst cheesecake every been to, food is gross, service is poor.  Horrible chef horrible uncooked food"}
{"text":"Cleanliness - zero star.  Breadcrumbs on the table and the seat.  Menu was covered with old spilled food and grease.  It was really gross.
Food - one star.  Fish and chips with cole slaw.  Fish batter was way under cooked.  I ate one of four pieces and hope I don't get sick.  The cole slaw had no flavor.  The fries were excellent.
Service - three stars.  My water glass was promptly refilled except the lemons were not replenished.
Will not return to this location."}

Great service provided by Amy.
Salads were large and fresh. We skipped dessert though its hard to do this with a bakery full of

Maybe next visit."}
{"text":"I love this place. I like the dim lights while I eat it's very relaxing. The bread is great! I like the variety. My favorite meal I like to get there is the Thai chicken pasta! Oh my gosh to die for. And any of their cheesecakes are worth getting! :)"}
{"text":"I will say this may not be a fair review as a drink was spilled on me in the first 5 minutes of me arriving and it may have been 50% my kids fault. The other drink spilled on me from my other kid was 100% her fault so I may be jaded, but the waiter didn't seem kid savvy and placed the wrong order for my wife. The manager said we'd get a credit for that one so we'll see. I'd suggest not bringing kids unless they're restaurant trained."}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday Night and all I can say is that this place is poorly managed. I will never attempt this place on a weekend, because the turn around time is slow. Starts off with the front desk which has a poor system of seating people. The hostess are not friendly at all. Our server was overwhelmed to say the least. There are so many restaurants in Vegas, not worth your time waiting for this place. 

As a side note: what restaurant runs out of Salmon on a Tuesday Night?"}
{"text":"I've been here only once, however not by choice. If I had it my way, I'd eat here more, I personally liked the layout of this place. I wasn't really distracted, and thought it was a nice time with the Wife. She was pregnant at the time, so she wasn't really able to enjoy the food as much as I did, which is unique in it's own positive way, yet not too \"different.\" Price wise was about average, I would recommend it if your looking for a subtle place to dine while in the area.

[Reader: Please add me as a friend!]"}
{"text":"The people were nice but the food was really hit or miss. The appetizers were sloppy, most things were greasy and started falling apart if that makes sense. The pizza was soggy and overly cheesed. The burger came in over cooked.

Maybe we should have  just stuck with the cheesecake."}
{"text":"The Philly cheesesteak bread is real tough.  It was very hard to eat.  In fact, I could not eat more than four bites and when I mentioned this to the server, she really didn't care.   They do have a good kids meal selection, and the cheesecake was good, of course.  
The bathroom was very messy.  Paper towels were everywhere.  
Also, my son got a kids meal but was charged $3 for his drink.  When she asked what size for him, I wish I was told the drink with the kids meal was free and the bigger was $3.  
Be careful when you leave because there is a column by the door with a square bottom. I hit my knee on the corner and was lucky it didn't break the skin because it was chipped."}
{"text":"The service was a plus on this visit, along with the food.  We like the consistency.  This is a place my mother likes to eat at when she visits."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and RAW chicken I had a to go order our chicken salad lotterly had raw chicken on it and when I called to Talk to the manager he was very rude did not care that our chicken was raw and just kept telling me to contact postmates because they delivered it it was not postmates fault for raw chicken it was the Cheesecake Factory who is in the wrong will never ever eat or order from here again they will get you sick and not care if I dident look at the chicken before serving it to my daughter and elderly mother in law they could have got very very sick and maybe even be hospitalized."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I come here often and each time that I have come I have had great food as well as great service. I will continue to visit here."}
{"text":"Last night we decided last minute to rush over to the Cheescake Factory located on Green Valley Pkwy.  We made it in just before closing time at midnight we were greeted with smiles and very courteous staff. Our server was Shawna. She was absolutely the sweetest person and treated us with excellent customer service. Our food was delicious and we were there to celebrate my sister in laws birthday, by the time we were finished with our dinner the restaurant was completely empty. The staff brought over a complimetery ice cream and sang happy birthday to her. I would highly recommended this restaurant to anyone  taking the time to read this review...my hat off to you the staff at Cheescake Factory for making our dining experience a memorable one for us. Thank you again from our family!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always great food, always great service! My personal favorite, when I want to be fat, is the mac n cheese burger with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"For my boyfriend's birthday we decided to go to dinner at the cheesecake factory. We waited almost 30 minutes to be seated, which wasn't a big deal. We ordered steak tacos for me and bang bang chicken and shrimp for him. 
When the food came my steak was undercooked, not pink but red in the center!! Some pieces looked almost raw!! Not what I was expecting. The waiter didn't ask how I wanted it cooked and I didn't remember to tell him either. So he took it to the kitchen and came back to say, it would take another 12-15 minutes!!! He offered me a side salad on the house. 
In the meantime, my bf is chowing down on his food that was cooked correctly. I ended up eating some of his while I was waiting. So finally by the time my food came back my bf was already done eating. The manager brought my food out and explained that he had it cooked well done. The tacos had a good taste but I only ate 2 of the 4 and asked for a box. After eating bread, the salad and some of my bf's food I wasn't too hungry at that point. 
When the check came, it had 2 orders of steak tacos instead of just one. At that point I started to get pissed off by the whole experience. I told the waiter about the error and he corrected it. We had to wait a while before he came back with change. We won't be back to this location. We should have gone to the South Side, I think things would have been handled a lot differently there. I'm just happy my bf enjoyed his birthday meal even though it wasn't the most enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Super slow service. Requested a change in our seating and server never flagged down the hostess for us until we did ourselves. No drink refills either. I don't think the waiter was trained enough to take care of the entire patio section by himself. 

Food was mediocre as well. Jambalaya was extremely dry and the salad was dumped in dressing. I've definitely had better at other Cheesecake locations. I was swamped after hours of walking and shopping but then this experience just made it worse..."}
{"text":"Of course The Cheesecake Factory is known for their fabulous cheesecake- Yummmm! But their Greek salad is probably the best I've ever had - it was simply perfect! My husband had the Chicken Piccata which was excellent and tasty, and my dinner, Chicken Bellagio, was nothing short of divine!  Fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory seemed to be the perfect place to meet others for lunch.  It's located in the North Vegas Outlet Mall,  We were early so ordered the quesadilla as an appetizer.  That should have been our lunch.  The appetizer shared by two was delicious and there was a lot of it.  We had expected the hot jalapeno peppers to be on the side but they weren't.  We had to dig them out.  The lunch caesar's salad was delicious but also huge.

The air conditioner kept it very cold .. probably perfect for workers but not for guests.  

Server was okay, not great.  We had to remind her about items a couple times."}
{"text":"Had lunch at CF yesterday.  The food was terrible.  The french fries my son ordered were cold and soggy.  I had soup and salad.  The soup was cold and the salad was over dressed.  The couple next to us had sent their lunches back.  I overheard them state their food was raw.  They were brought new plates 15 minutes later and they didn't eat them.  All in all, not a good experience.  They need to employ a new day chef!"}
{"text":"This has been the best food place in Vegas thus far. We came here for lunch ... the servings were huge, service was great and extremely inexpensive. ... we had 2 little kids with us and the staff was amazing. Recommend the spicy noodles with chicken and the pancakes."}
{"text":"The food choices are plentiful. It's definitely one of the better chain restaurants. I usually get corn tamales which are good. My complaint is an unnecessarily mean girl working the hostess station. I got confused about our seating and asked a question, very nicely. She looked at me like I was an idiot and snapped at me. She was awful. I would avoid coming back here just because of her unpleasantness. Seriously, even if someone is having a bad night, don't take it out on your customers."}
{"text":"This location is one of my favorite local chain restaurants. The service is always amazing and I can depend on the food always being great! I usually get the steak tacos and a slice of Oreo cheesecake to go!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss at this place decent food, bad service. We were seated in the bar area on a Tuesday evening, the dining room had a lot of available seating, but they sat us at those little tiny tables where you have to basically sit on top of one another and cant have a private conversation. That wasn't any fun. From there our waiter was very busy, running around like a chicken with his head cut off. We had 3 different waiters come and try to help us, it got really confusing and a bit frustrating. After 30 mins we finally got our drinks and our order in. The food was decent, but with all the waiting we ate really quick so we could get out of there and get home. My sister and I agreed it would be easier to just order our cheese cake at the to-go counter instead of ordering it through our waiter. Paid the bill after another 15 minutes of waiting got our cheese cake and got the heck out of there. It shouldn't take you almost 3 hours to eat on a Tuesday night :("}
{"text":"Walking into The Cheesecake Factory (at night) reminds me of a Las Vegas Casino.  Not the downtown casinos that are all closed in and almost claustrophobic, mind you, but the expansive Steve Wynn casinos on the strip.  It's huge.  It borders on gaudy, but in a nice way.  You also can't really tell what time of day it is - probably so you don't mind how long you wait for your server to come back to you (though we did).

I'd imagine that during the day, the monstrous windows in the front of the place give it a ton of light, and it would be a completely different feel, but at night, it just gave that vibe.  The noise is pretty incredible too - like the old noise of casinos (they don't have noise any more, sad to say).

As to the food - pretty impressive overall.  I just wish that they didn't have 300 items on the menu.  And I didn't count, the server gave that number when I asked for a suggestion since I didn't feel like opening the tome of selections.  I eventually settled on one of the items from the specials list (Caramel Chicken).

We also had some crab cake appetizers, a massive double BBQ burger, a chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn shrimp.  The fried food overall was the worst.  The burger was good, but huge.  The crab cakes were surprisingly good.   It was really the service that did them in, but to their credit the manager (or someone doing an imitation of a manger) came out to tell us that the food would be out some time.  Then we had to also wait on the bill, and to pay the bill, and so on...

If I had any suggestions, it would be for them to go on \"Kitchen Nightmares\" with Gordon Ramsay.  Not because the place isn't clean - it's immaculate.  But the size of the menu, coupled with the portion size, is insane.  Cut the menu in half (or quarters), and do the same with the portions.  They could even shave something off the price at the same time.

That way every person wouldn't be walking out with leftovers and they wouldn't have to spend so much time at every table trying to help diners navigate the menu.  Not to mention, there would be room for dessert.  You know, the cheesecake?"}
{"text":"This particular Cheesecake Factory Restaurant, the one in Boca Park is not up to par with the other ones here in Las Vegas.  It is hit and miss every time you eat here. Some times its delicious, beautifully prepared and other times they sort of just throw food in a dish and put it in front of you.  Missing ingredients is usually a game you play trying to find what the menu says the entrée is supposed to have and where is it? Missing as usual, then when you bring it to the waitress or waiter's attention you get \"that look\" and they will be right back with the ingredient that is missing.  Also I wonder why every time we eat there, I have to send something back because it doesn't taste the same as the time before when I ordered the same thing.  I have noticed though, when Jason the Oriental Manager is on duty the food usually comes out wrong, he doesn't oversee the food prep nor does he come to the table when there is a problem as most managers do to find out what is wrong.  It's like he's invisible when there is a problem.   Bad indigestion, a staff that really couldn't care less about how long you are waiting for your meal, and if you send it back you will be waiting a very long time for the replacement to come to the table is what you get here.  Management or should I say one manager in particular the Oriental Manager really isn't concerned with having happy customers.  I don't go for the cheese cake which I'm sure is delicious, I go for the entrees which could use improvement in so many ways.  For the price of the entrees they should come out right the first time and look beautiful and taste perfect which they don't.  Save your money, save your tummy, and dine at a different Cheesecake Factory not the one in the Boca Park Shopping Center."}
{"text":"Normal rush hour you'd think you are going to wait. .Got seated very quickly. The server was very attentive to drink refills, questions, and suggestions. Was very impressed with the food. The lunch prices reasonable. Made for a great day."}
{"text":"I come here often and I usually come here for the good service but tonight.. everything just went wrong! 
First off, we got our bread we only got the sourdough. I know, for someone who comes here often, That were supposed to get both wheat and sourdough. We had to chase someone to get us wheat bread since that's the only bread I eat. 
Then we finally ordered. Good thing we got there before it got busy. As it was getting busy, we saw each table getting sat. We patiently waited for our food that took ALMOST 30 MINUTES without the server even telling us that our food is coming up or updating us or whatever. We saw the table over (who got there about 7 minutes after us) get their food first!!!!!!! 
Then upon getting boxes, our server goes, \"okay KIDS can I get you anything else\". That's soooooo rude! I don't go to a restaurant saying \"okay GRANDMA this is what I want\" to my server. So since I was a \"kid\" we tipped like we were \"kids\". Maybe that's why we didn't get the service we deserved cause we were \"kids\"  NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN! I would rather spend my money somewhere else! Thanks cheesecake factory for ruining our date tonight. We'll make sure to recommend you to someone who wants to have a horrible night."}
{"text":"I  find it disappointing and disingenuous for a place with the reputation of the Cheesecake Factory to fudge wait times over the phone especially for families. I am still left to wonder how the 15 minute wait we were told on the phone turned into 1 hour in the 8 minutes it took for us to get there and check it. Expected much more from Cheesecake."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory sucks. Ain't no other way to say it. Let me explain why.

I pull into the parking lot and am waiting on my wife to show up as she's on her way. I call and speak to \"Frank\" who tells me the wait list is only 5 minutes. I'm only 5 spaces from the front door and can see both front doors so...I'm thinking we're going to be good to go. Well 4 min later we're walking in the door and I get told the wait is now 20 minutes. Wow, that's quite a jump in only 4 minutes and there wasn't a horde of people rushing the door. Either someone can't count or someone was lying...got a hunch the counting ability is just fine....

So we get on the list, get our pager and then cool our heels outside. And outside stinks. Literally stinks. Like has anyone emptied the trash by the benches? Finally after a 25 min wait someone comes out and calls for us by name...the pager never did go off. I got the excuse that it doesn't work outside. Hmm, I guess having equipment with a range of 100 ft from the base station is asking too much. 

So we finally get seated. And service...well, it was slow. You wait for bread. You wait for drinks. You wonder if the waiter went to the bar to watch the baseball game on TV. You wonder if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. And then you get to place an order.

When you finally get your food well quite frankly it sucks. My soon to be 3 year old wanted chicken strips and he wanted apple juice. He picks up the juice, starts to move the straw to his mouth and is rewarded with an apple juice shower as the lid was not snapped all the way down on the cup. Nice...now I got a soggy kid. And that soggy kid ate some of the french fries but spit out the chicken. As for my wife, she ordered Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. She ate about 5 bites before she pushed it away. And I ordered a Mexico City Chicken dish that was marginally passable, but after a couple of bites it left my mouth feeling...well it's starchy...or like it's powdery..it's just weird. 2 hours after leaving the place my wife and I still have this strange aftertaste from their food. I've never really had an aftertaste like this before. Again it's just weird. 

From walking in the front door until we left took almost 2 full hours. We spent $80 and ended up leaving well over 3/4 of our food for Republic Services to send to the Apex landfill. I can write that it sucked, but quite frankly that's understating just how bad it was. 

My wife said to show mercy and give 2 Stars? Not a chance. If it sucks it sucks. Call it as I experience it and be done with it. 1 Star. And when you see penquins inside the gates to Hades, you might see me darken their doors again. Until such time...oh no Boo-Boo. Ain't going back here even if you tried to drag me in. 

(With apologies to my wife who had a rough day and I thought a good meal with cheesecake might brighten her day, but instead these jackasses made it even worse! I waited a while to write this one so I could cool off but needless to say I was not happy when I left)."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of the lack of call ahead seating or reservations. The food was good as was the wait staff.  Excellent cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Had better service recently but I also didn't get a to go order. Came for lunch on a weekend and they weren't that busy. We gave the hostess our name and she told us to move to the side and we will be called very shortly. She made it seem like it wasn't gonna be long. She also didn't give us a buzzer. We ended up waiting a bit before we were called. Our server was friendly and greeted us quickly. I got the egg roll sampler. It was good but definitely not worth $12 for 4 egg rolls cut in half. My sister in law the the chicken and biscuits and she liked it. My husband got the salmon and thought it was ok. We got a few cheesecakes to go and went on our way."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with cheesecake factory?? Seriously I have yet to ever try something bad at this place, so reliable for a large portion of some great food and this one in Caesars is no different.  Went here after a long night in Vegas, we all woke up around 2pm and walked (or stumbled) over to cheesecake factory and began chowing down on the bread.  Once we got the bread in us we immediately order bloody mary's to get us back on track for the vegas life.  Our food came and I always stick with the Crispy Chicken Costeletta, try it, it is absolutely amazing.  All in all this meal brought us somewhat back to reality and our waitress was awesome, she would come over and joke around with us as we began ordering more drinks and getting our smiles painted back on.  For a great meal at a great price go to this place and you will not be let down...."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.  Their menu is huge - maybe too big - so there's definitely something for everyone!  This visit was a good one, as expected.  Our server Audrey was great and took good care of us.  If I ever had a complaint with Cheesecake Factory it would be about the ridiculous wait times (because they are so popular) but we were really lucky on this trip and only had a 15 minute wait.  Yahoo!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of huge chain restaurants. Taco Bell? Barf. McDonalds? Bleh. Olive Garden? Ick. Panera Bread? I can make this stuff myself. Chipotle? ...Well, I actually like Chipotle, but you get the point. Essentially, what you get at chain restaurants can be hit or miss. The food might be good one day but terrible the next; one establishment might be clean and presentable while another might be deplorable; customer service--if any--might be excellent one night but completely lacking another night. Although I try to keep an open mind, having experienced this myself, I walked into The Cheesecake Factory with fairly modest expectations.

I usually do not visit The Cheesecake Factory unless there is a special occasion, such as a once-in-a-year family gathering, a birthday party, or a baby shower. It just so happened that one of my colleagues was having a lunchtime baby shower and this was the venue. So, I drove from Shadyside to Southside, met a little traffic, and parked my car in one of the garages without too much trouble. I walked into the restaurant. As expected, the entrance is very large, expansive, and modernesque, almost like walking into a super high-end shopping mall or a mansion. Ahead was the host/hostess station. I introduced myself and stated that I was there for a baby shower until my colleague's name. They found her name and directed me through the labyrinth of a restaurant all the way to the back and around the corner.

Okay! Let's see if I get lost...

After I found my group and exchanged pleasantries, I sat down and waited a couple minutes for our waiter. I ordered a mojito and a glass of water for the time being. I received the mojito, which looked and tasted quite good, but he seemed to have misplaced or forgotten my water. I never got a chance to flag him down until he came back who knows how many minutes later to take our food orders. I ordered a pizza and salad combo while my colleagues ordered pasta, steak, salads, and sandwiches. The food took about 20 minutes to arrive, which wasn't too bad considering our group was composed of 10 or so people. I got my water (yay!) and my food. The margherita pizza I ordered was supposedly a personal size pizza and the house salad I got was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. Both tasted quite good, but were very large, which was the norm at The Cheesecake Factory. I ate my salad first before moving onto the pizza, of which I managed to eat two slices.

During our meal, several of us wanted to get boxes for their leftovers, but our waiter was nowhere to be found. We ended up having to wait until the very end of our meal when our waiter suddenly appeared to ask how our meal was and if we would like some dessert. Some of us ordered dessert while the rest of us requested boxes. The cheesecakes that came out looked divine; alas, I didn't order any because I had eaten and drunk too much. Finally, getting each of our bills didn't take too long. We boxed our food, washed up, and left the restaurant feeling much too stuffed.

Overall, the food and drinks were quite good. There was no hair or odd treasures to be found in the food, and no floaty things in our drinks. My only gripe is the outrageous portion sizes, even for lunch! One slice of cheesecake could feed a family of three or four! Only in America...

Service lacked somewhat, however. The waiter could have given us a bit more attention in addition to the typical ordering, delivery, and payment collection processes.

As I have stated in the beginning, I will not come to The Cheesecake Factory unless there was a special occasion. Supersize portions and flaky customer service are just not for me."}
{"text":"I think this is a good place to go when the members of your group can't agree on what to eat.. because they have almost everything you could possibly want.

Sandwiches, burgers, pasta, seafood, chicken, steak, pizza, appetizers, and other stuff. And cheesecake of course.

I got the jambalaya pasta today. I was in the mood for something spicy and this did the trick. It wasn't too hot where I was dying while eating, but good enough to get the kick. The chicken was so soft and the shrimp perfectly cooked. The linguine was really good too! Only thing was, it was a bit too oily and kind of heavy. (Sidenote: this dish only comes in full portion. I wish it came in lunch size because it's pretty big.)

My friend and I also split a chocolate raspberry cheesecake. At first it's really good! but then it gets to be a bit too rich for my taste. Same for her, because we couldn't even finish it. Also, we were really full. 

I really enjoy coming here cause they have good food, but sometimes their food is a bit too heavy/rich for my taste and the waits are really long. Also, because there are so many people service can be a bit slow sometime. Not unbearably slow, but noticeably slow. No reservations either. So, yeah. But their bread is good! Always."}
{"text":"Run of the mill Cheesecake Factory, nothing special, they haven't changed much in the years that it has been around nation wide. If you've been to one you've been to them all. The food quality is still good, the cheese cake still amazing, I still go back! Nothing special, but nothing to complain about either! The only downside is parking at this mall near this location is a headache sometimes but it doesn't stop me from going. 

Staff is friendly, place is clean, and inviting. Not my first place to go always but never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I usually have pretty good service every time I dine at this particular location, however, last night (November 18, 2015) the service my guy and I had was PHENOMENAL! Kathleen(Kat) is probably one of the absolute best servers I've ever had. I go out and eat a lot, as does my man, and together we made it a point to tell the manager how fantastic we thought she was. She's a genuinely happy and helpful person. So sweet and totally perfect for the hospitality industry. I can't say enough how happy I was with our service. Kat you're amazing! Thank you sooo much for such a nice dining experience! (:"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory. It's... you know. The same everywhere.

The great thing about this place is that everyone can eat here. Everyone can find something they like on the menu, so it's a people-pleaser. 

My favorite things on the menu are the sweet corn cakes, avocado eggrolls and Godiva chocolate cheesecake.

We're fans, but not super fans. With that said, the freebie bread they pass out is definitely a winner. Mmmm."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times over the years. I have come for lunch, dinner, and dessert. I have also bought desserts at the counter for holidays. Never have done the take-out.
The staff is always good and I have never had a \"bad\" experience. You just have to know going in that it will be busy, there will be a wait, and you will most likely not get a booth but those horrible small tables that are shoved next to each other and then you are eating with strangers. I hate that.

Tiramisu cheesecake is my favorite."}
{"text":"Went back to try Cheesecake Factory again. I must say our visit this time was very good. Our server Alex was excellent and the food was just as good. Even being a busy Saturday our food did not take long at all after placing our order."}
{"text":"Just ok, we waited two hours to be seated. If the Cheesecake Factory wasn't attached to the mall, we wouldn't have waited that long. After being seated, we were greeted promptly by our server. She brought our drinks and bread quickly. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp. My husband got the jambalaya. The bang bang shrimp and chicken was ok. The shrimp was small and there was more rice than meat. My husbands dish was good and full of flavor. The draft beer list really needs updated with more IPA's. We had the salted caramel cheesecake, it was good, but the middle was rather cold. It seemed as though it wasn't completely defrosted."}
{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times since I'm not in the Green Valley area often, so it's typically to meet other friends halfway or the location of birthday dinners, etc. I haven't been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory for several years now, however, I've been impressed during my last two visits.

One big factor of my newfound respect is the addition of their SkinnyLicious menu. The primary reason I stopped dining with them was because of their calorie-heavy menu (they have pasta dishes that exceed 2,000 calories!). The menu features a list of items that were specially curated to not exceed 490 calories for appetizers and 590 calories for entrees and some items from their regular menu that happen to be under those thresholds. However, as I'm sure you've guessed, the portion sizes are cut dramatically. They apparently don't know how to cook filling and healthy dishes.

Off their SkinnyLicious menu, I've tried the Santorini Farro Salad (farro, cucumbers, tomatoes, beets, red onions, feta cheese, tzatziki, and vinaigrette) and Chicken Samosas (crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken with cilantro sauce). Both surprisingly delicious and not overly terrible for you. The salad was ridiculously small and there were four tiny samosas. The prices weren't bad, but it's sad considering the fact that those dishes were still loaded with calories and fat.

I was surprised that their Fried Calamari (served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce) was really good. Also, I've had their Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad (grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber, and Romaine) with the dressing on the side. It was tasty and it was such a large portion that I couldn't finish it.

The SkinnyLicious menu is great, however, it's really hard to love a place that serves dishes that have more calories than you should consume in a day. It's a shame that a lot of diners are really oblivious to restaurants' nutrition information and obviously, restaurants don't want to be transparent about it. So, although I don't advocate dining at these restaurants, if you do, as I'm sure I will in the future (even though I won't want to), definitely order off the SkinnyLicious menu.

Side note: their Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake (seasonal) and many other cheesecakes are really good. Share it with 1-2 people and don't think about the calories."}
{"text":"I like their food and atmosphere but sometimes its too crowned and long line waiting,I always wanna try the desert but always ended up too full next time im going to leave some room for desert:)"}
{"text":"Love their enormous menu, especially the 'skinny menu'. 
Excellent service! 
Fantastic cheesecake, it doesn't get much better!"}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE! The prices for the food are outrageous and the food is so bad. We were without service for 45 minutes and when we did get service the waitress was rude and never came to our table, it took 20 minutes to get refills on drinks. We ended up being there for 3 hours and it was awful. Almost got to the point of us getting up and leaving. She overcharged us for several things as well, we didn't end up correcting her because we wanted to pay the $150 bill and leave. An example is she charged us 4.90 for a kids bowl of strawberries that is 2.95. Very upset and do not recommend, much better places to go in Las Vegas don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Never would I have ever thought I would give the cheesecake factory 5 stars. I had an incredible experience here the other night when we were in a time crunch for a show. Dawn Barrett met us at the door and could tell we were in a rush. She expedited food and drinks. Miso Salmon was incredible! Everything came out hot and quick. She was friendly and went way above and beyond for us. She needs to be praised by leadership. She turned us into loyal customers. Thank you Dawn."}
{"text":"Erica our waitress was more than accommodating, she was a great waitress!  Very friendly and pleasant. The food was fantastic! We had the fried macaroni and cheese bites for apps. Outstanding! We had the chicken Madeira and chicken parmigiana Pizza!  Both dishes were amazing!  My friend is still talking about the chicken parmigiana Pizza at breakfast.  She absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"At the last minute, I changed my birthday dinner local from Oregano's to TCF. No hate against Oregano's, but I wasn't really that hungry and wanted cheesecake as opposed to a pizookie for dessert. 

So we made our way to Chandla and our group of 6 was quickly seated, with no reservations mind you. Our server was very sweet, though it seemed she wasn't so well-versed with the menu quite yet. Most of our group ordered off of the small plates menu. I got the chicken samosas (I had no idea what they were, and neither did our server) with the caribbean cooler to drink. Both of which were delightful. Everyone else seemed pleased with their dishes. 

For dessert, they came over and did the birthday thing, and I had the RED VELVET CHEESECAKE WHICH IS SO GOOD OMG. I can't wait to have the other half that is sitting in my fridge as we speak."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday thinking that a Monday would be less busy than any other day. Boy was I wrong! We arrived at 5PM and waited in a small line (5 minutes) to get a pager. I was told for a table for two it'd be a 40 minute wait. I didn't mind that too much as with the pager you could walk around anywhere in the mall. You just needed to be near Forever 21 or Sporting Life within the last 10 minutes. (I guess to ensure you can walk back within the time they buzz you) We walked back and sat down near the tables in front of Pickle Barrel. We waited another 50 minutes before going inside to ask what position we were in line. We ended up being next and got sat down in a booth. I understand that the time is an estimation but wish we would've been able to walk around as opposed to waiting for so long. 

We sat down and ordered right away, we had studied the menu while waiting. My boyfriend got the Hibachi Steak and I, the Chicken Madeira. The wait for food took another hour. The food was really good. The steak was cooked exactly as to what was asked and was nice and tender. The wasabi mashed potatoes was interesting, not really spicy but it had a  little kick. I can see why the Chicken Madeira is their most popular dish,  it has a good mix of flavours and the melted cheese is a nice added touch. For dessert we got the Tiramisu, which was also really good but served with too much whipped cream. Their food portions are huge and the prices reflect that. 

The biggest downside to Cheesecake Factory (besides the long wait time) is the service. It is non existent. The restaurant is chaotic, there are so many servers and workers standing around, and it's hard to even walk by them to go to the washroom or to your table. Our server only asked us how we we're doing, and if we needed anything, once after we ordered. When we wanted to order dessert we had to flag her down. We didn't get offered any top ups on our water or drinks. 

TLDR: good food, too long of a wait, and bad service."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service. 4 stars for the cheesecake. The cheesecake were delicious as always but seem like the slices are smaller now. 3 stars for the food. We went there for breakfast which didn't consist of much. The only meat option is ham or bacon and we don't do pork (well and the chicken chorizo which is not too good)."}
{"text":"We were a little worried after reading some reviews , but....
Went in at about 7pm on a Tuesday. Got a seat for our party of two right away. Unfortunately waited ...25 min with no water or a greet from our server. A waitress from a different section finally noticed and came to see if our server had been there yet. After knowing we have not been serviced at all , she helped us right away! 

After a while the manager came over and apologized for the wait. He did a great job and was there to make our experience right. He put our food on rush and personally delivered our appetizers :)

The egg roll sampler is tasty! Lots of variety and different sauces to compliment. The entrees were good. Can't wait to try our cheesecake! It looks delicious!!

We will most definitely be back for snacks and maybe dessert! Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Waitress was awesome. I ordered the cheese pasta with chicken and the carrot cheese cake. It was so yummy. I would definitely come again to try any of the other pastas."}
{"text":"There isn't a Cheesecake Factory in my city, so I don't mind one bit visiting this one when I'm out in Vegas. Though it's location at the very end of the Forum Shops at Caesar's is a bit inconvenient, the longest I've had to wait for a seat was 40 minutes even during busier seasons (once for a party of 11 and once for a party of 4).

Both times I've eaten here, the service was impeccable, and of course the portions are huge, the food tasty, and all well worth the price. My friend swears by the Chicken Madeira, though I never order it because I don't eat mushrooms. The mac-and-cheese burger is delicious, as is the chicken burrito (though I would have preferred it to have shredded chicken rather than cubed). I also really enjoy the Flying Gorilla alcoholic milkshake.

I don't eat here EVERY time I go to Vegas, but it's definitely a good option, and probably one of the better ones in regards to price - especially in the Forum Shops. Again, I can't stress enough that both times I ate here the service was great (in a town where I usually find the service to be average at best)."}
{"text":"The food and is so good here! I have only been to a Cheesecake Factory 1 other time about 10 years ago. We went here for my daughters birthday- her choice. I got the top shelf margarita to start and hubby got the regular margarita(not sure what he was thinking)- mine was better, very good by the way!For dinner, I ordered the chicken francaise, the kids had pizza, the other had the spicy chicken sandwich( don't remember the name, sorry) off the adult menu, coconut chicken. We then proceeded to have dessert. All the kids, and their Aunt, ordered cheesecake( birthday cake and peanut butter), dad ordered the brownie sundae- he doesn't like cheesecake(his loss our gain). They all liked the,even my son who doesn't like cheesecake- he had the oreo one.  Everything was a hit. They sang to my daughter and put a candle in her cheesecake.  Great place! A little dark but a great place! I would definitely go back every day!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.... Ok so with the Cheesecake factory, there are some pros and some cons. 
Bad news first:
Cons: You will wait. Awhile. For a Table. They are always packed. Its a popular destination. The food is OKAY. I mean its called the Cheesecake factory not the Food factory. 

Pros: You can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait. Its posted outside. Dim lighting...I love me some romantic mood lighting on dates. My dish of choice is the Louisiana chicken. The chicken is fried to perfection and the pasta is delightful. They serve you bread when you are seated which is warm and delicious. The cheesecake. OMG the cheesecake. I haven't had one I didn't like. They have any kind you can think of. My favorites are the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and the Banana Cream. Ok now my mouth is watering."}
{"text":"Told the server I had a bad allergy, and it still ended up in my food.  Management had the decency to tell me what happened, but comped out just an appetizer and not the whole meal."}
{"text":"Service was POOR !! 

Me & my best friend came in to eat , waiting was minimum . Got sat down with drink orders , ordered our food , asked for bread . 


Our servers name was SCOTT B. 


The second time around we asked for bread again , I was already done with my plate by the time he noticed that we didn't have the bread we ordered. 

Then I asked him if we could get a split check then he rolled his eyes ! 

Poor poor customer service! Took him long enough to even give us a refill as well ."}
{"text":"Pretty decent! I decided to stop in after work and I ordered the Steak Diane. It was definitely grilled to perfection and so tender, but my only hesitation is that it didn't have the exact quality I was looking for. It tasted a bit commercial, and I know it's a commercial chain. However, because of the price, I just still feel it should be a bit more quality in authentic taste. 
The other issue is that I ordered it go, and it was almost ice cold when I got home. I don't live far and I didn't make any stops. Because of the temp, I am sure it would have seemed a bit cold to me even if I ate there. 
I am not totally counting it, and will go again. Because the Steak DianeThey have a huge menu that can feel a tad bit overwhelming when trying to determine an entrée. But on the flip side, it is GREAT because there are so many options."}
{"text":"So many people like to eat at the Cheesecake Factory that there is always a wait. I don't mind waiting for good food. They have an extensive menu. It's probably the biggest menu I have ever seen. I believe instead of a huge menu of mediocre food that it would be better to have a smaller menu of really good food. So the last two times I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory I went in and got cheesecake to go. I tried the Cookie Dough flavor and they aren't kidding-there was a lot of cookie dough. In fact there was very little cheesecake compared to cookie dough. It was clunky and I wasn't a huge fan. The second trip I got Key Lime cheesecake. It is amazing. It's definitely one of my top 2 favorites. It is tangy and has a little bit of zing to it. It is refreshing during the warmer weather. There is a huge list of flavored to try. I can't wait to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Although their food is extremely overpriced, we enjoy going here every other year as a treat to ourselves. The sunday brunch is yummy. I greatly enjoy their eggs benedict and my son can almost finish the gigantic breakfast burrito.

The cheesecake is, of course, fantastic! We have tried several flavors and have yet to be disappointed by any of them. We would go more often and I would have given 5 stars, if they weren't so overpriced."}
{"text":"Bad service on this particular visit. Was there to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. Told the waiter we were there to celebrate her birthday.When it was time for dessert, my girlfriend picked out her cheesecake. I got my phone ready to record the singing celebration but it didn't happen. Instead the waiter brought the cheesecake over with the bill and left. This upset me because other tables got sang to. My girlfriend did not want to make a big scene of it but I know she was hurt. Thank you to the waiter for the bad service and making my girlfriend feel less special."}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory! When we went there last week, we all ordered burgers, which were absolutely delicious. Mine ended up being too big to finish, so Cheesecake Factory is good for those with big appetites. I enjoyed my cheeseburger and left the restaurant stuffed. The French fries were amazing also!!! The wait for the food was longer than I would have liked, but definitely worth the wait. The waiter was also very friendly and sociable."}
{"text":"The chicken medeira was very good.  Everything I  had could not have been Better. The mint green tea had a great mint taste,  and the crab wonton for an appetizer was great.  The Waite staff was also professional"}
{"text":"I just don't understand why the Cheesecake Factory is so hyped up!  I'll start by saying I have not been here for quite some time and was excited to give it another try.  When we walked in we asked for a table outside and then after waiting for 20 min they sat us inside, after reminding her we wanted outside we were told it would be another 25 min because she forgot.

Our waitress was useless, she messed up more things about our order than I could have ever imagined, and dropped two of our dishes upon bringing them to our table (This caused us to wait even longer due to remaking of our food.).  After always needing to ask for more water and asking three times for mayo, saying she was awful is an understatement.  

The only reason this place is getting three stars is because when you finally get the food it's always pretty good with nice serving sizes.

All in all, I won't be in a hurry to come back anytime soon.  

Return factor 15%"}
{"text":"I thought I had already written this but maybe not.  Had around 7 kids and an adult with me and went for lunch.  Well, little did we know we should have reservations for such a party and no way we were getting in.  So we went in the line for a slice of cheesecake each.  Wow, what a selection.  And the line moved pretty well.   I have to say that the value in that cheese cake is pretty strong.  I had one with about 20 ingredients and it was huge.  Everyone really loved theirs.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a whim here recently.  I had pit beef dip sandwich with a green salad.  Oh so very disappointing.  The fatty sliced beef was generously loaded on a seeded hamburger bun more suited for a hamburger than a dip sandwich.  The small cup of au jus dipping sauce was served on the side.  The green salad was a bowl of lettuce with a slice of tomato.  Really??  Maybe they should just list it more properly as a bowl of lettuce. 

Good service from hostess and waitress but that didn't make up for the below average food at above average prices.  I won't be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"This place was okay for a Cheesecake Factory and I have been to several.  I had the chicken and biscuits and the chocolate mousse cheesecake. The chicken and biscuits was like a chicken pot pie with a buttermilk biscuit."}
{"text":"Ordered the Garlic Noodles and had a super long hair in my food... was told the manager was going to come over and take care of it. Manager never arrived.

My waitress was sweet and professional, and she got me a replacement order of noodles. Bartender was nice as well. Sad that the manager on duty, whoever he or she is, never took care of the situation. Can't believe I had to pay for this food. Love the Cheesecake Factory, but I'm not impressed with the management at this location."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with couple friends food was o k....forgot to order my salad...so dark couldn't even see the menu! Of course the cheese cake was delicious!"}
{"text":"I had a bad serving of the Chicken Madeira ... the sauce was pretty sour tasting and although I know it's made from a balsamic sauce it was almost like the chicken was rancid or something .. Very disappointing after waiting an hour and a half for a table .. our server was very kind and I wasn't charged for my entree. The cheesecakes were delish!! I think this chain is better for why they're known for .. which is the desserts .."}
{"text":"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory. They have a lot of variety on their menu! I love it! It's so diverse. My favorite thing is the Diane steak and the salmon. It's always so tasty and never disappoints. It's such a good place if you want to go with family, friends, a date. Only one in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Love relaxing here after shopping and getting some good grub with friendly service. Servers do an excellent job, I have eaten here numerous times and have yet to have an experience less than extraordinary. Love the large menu as I am always able to find something here that I am in the mood for."}
{"text":"I understand it's their first few weeks but I am disappointed. We waited 1 and 1/2 until we get our buzzer. Then only  15 min and we were seated. Not Bad. We waited another half an hour before we got our meal. Again, I am ok with the wait. However , the soup was lukewarm. We asked the waiter if he can nuke it. He brought it back and said \"this time , it's hot at 110°. It was still cold. The meatloaf was also warm, not hot. I think the meal was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We ordered cheesecake after the meal and had to wait 45 min. Anyway, I will wait until the new year to try again. They have a lot of training to do. I expected more from a well established organization."}
{"text":"Brought my little boy here for lunch the other day since we were at a park on that side of town. It was lunch time and the place was packed but even so the wait for a table was only a couple minutes.
Our server was very nice. She brought me my most favorite tea super fast..its a passion fruit tea that is just amazing. She even bought my little guy an apple juice in a sippy cup.
I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp and he had a grilled cheese and fries.
Both came out very fast..which is good since they have some really good bread there that can fill you up.
She boxed everything up and even put my tea in a to go cup.
Another amazing visit to the factory!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to eat out at..this is the 1st time I ate at this location. Came here the other night with some friends and we had the yummy tropical iced tea. Shared some avocado rolls.  I had shrimp angel hair pasta..it was perfect with fresh tomatoes and cheese on it. Yummy! Friends ate some kind of peanut thai noodles..that tasted alot like peanut butter rather than peanuts.
Jessie B had this amazing salad.  Salads here are HUGE!
The service was ok..he could have been better. But its my fav place so I give him a pass."}
{"text":"The young lady at the host desk was rude and said your next then called 5 other names wth? I hope to never return."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and it was not too busy. Everyone ordered a fountain drink but mine was a lemonade and for some reason it took an extra 15 minutes to get when the food came it was lukewarm. Spoke to the manager and she happily took the food back to warm it up but when we got the bill she never took any money off nor did she come over when the food was brought to make sure  it was hot. The food was just OK not what we're used to at the Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately they had a bad night."}
{"text":"I was super excited to visit The Cheese Cake Factory but was very disappointed.

Firstly, as everybody has mentioned, you have to wait. It was just me and my friend so we got paged after an 1 1/2 even though we were told it be two hours. Apparently according to our sever, the only workaround this is to arrive right at opening time because after lunch time the place remains packed. 

The appetizers (Chicken Taquitos & Loaded Baker Potato Tots) were okay. They came in smaller proportions as compared to other menu items and were alright. 

The main's (Pasta Napoletena and Farfelle with Chicken and Garlic) were super underwhelming. I have had better pasta at other restaurants. Definitely do not recommend these items, it sounds much better than it tastes.

For dessert, we had Linda's Fudge Cake. It was very delicious although because it is so rich, I would recommend ordering a hot water with lemon drink to cut down on the heaviness."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed with how big the menu is at Cheesecake Factory, like how do the cooks remember all of those recipes and how does their food ordering team know what to stock?? 

Came here because my family was craving dessert but some of us had not eaten dinner yet so we did the human thing and ate first, knowing we should leave room for dessert of course.

We didn't have to wait ling to be seated, just ling enough to look over the cheesecakes on display.

Our server was attentive and didn't mind it when we asked for an extra bread basket and half joked inly to bring one spoon per dessert.. ok, maybe that wasn't a joke."}
{"text":"I had the Renee's special and the chicken salad was absolutely amazing. Our waitress was on the ball, she kept our beverages full and made sure everything was good. Great French onion soup and the price was very reasonable. Left there with a full stomach!"}
{"text":"So very Disappointed! My boyfriend and I came in after a walk from Fremont to have a beer and cool down before shopping, after I was done I paid for my two beers with an American Express gift card (The bartender told me when she gave me the receipt to sign that there was $52.87 left on it) we left went shopping and then headed back to our hotel once there I realize I left my gift card behind at the restaurant (While shopping my boyfriend paid for everything) i called the restaurant immediately and the bartender told me that I took my gift card with me I wrapped it in my receipt and walked away. the reason I'm very disappointed because I don't have a habit of bringing my restaurant receipts with me so I know for sure I didn't do that I clearly remember leaving it in the cup it's very sad to have things stolen  from you."}
{"text":"awesome tacos and salsa. oh the cheesecake took, well, the cake i guess"}
{"text":"2 stars only because the food was good. I'm a huge CF fan, at least of the ones I've been to before this one.

We came in Sunday night after the Superbowl and received absolutely terrible service. Three tables were sat after us, and all had drinks, bread, and orders taken before our server took our order. She was nowhere to be found. After about 10 minutes sitting at the table, I walked to the bar and asked the bartender for help. He said he would find her, but didn't. We ended up flagging down another waitress and as she was taking her order our original waitress came by, and that was the last time. She passed us off to the other girl and never looked back.

There was also a girl wearing street clothing delivering bar drinks to tables. If you didn't know any better, it would seem as though a random stranger was grabbing drinks off the bar and taking them away. That is completely unprofessional. I even overheard her deliver one to the wrong table. Also, watched the manager thank her for helping, so I guess he had no problem with working an employee off the clock (without a proper uniform). 

We had wanted to get some cheesecake to go, but we so displeased and ready to go by the end of the meal we decided against it. Bummer, because I was really craving a piece of chocolate mousse after a bad day.

I love the food at CF, the tomato basil flatbread is my go to - it is the perfect size and is fantastic. The kale salad is also fabulous. I've never had an experience like this at a CF either, usually is a very good time, with great service."}
{"text":"Came here around 2pm to take a lil dessert back to the hotel! This place was crowded and hot. Outside was cooler! I didnt like this place because of it being crowded and hot inside."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last month and we went on a Tuesday night. There was 15 minute wait so don't expect to be seated immediately. The seating is also limited for those waiting. We got seated at a table that wasn't properly set up with plates and silverware. The lighting in the back is dim which I didn't enjoy. However, the service was excellent. My server helped me make a great choice for dinner. I got the fried cheese to start and the Alfredo with shrimp for dinner. Both were delicious! We got the Oreo cheesecake and it was so good."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite chain restaurant. I get something new every time. Today I went for the grilled fish tacos...YUM! I also had the low carb cheesecake with strawberries. It did not taste any different then a normal slice and it was amazing! I'm still full 8 hours later (unlike some places). 

Even a few weeks ago I had a bad experience here(shocked) and I wrote to corporate. They handled the situation professionally and more then made up for their mistake. 

I will continue to sing the praises of Cheesecake Factory. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is usually a dependable place to eat. I figured I'd try them again after the fiasco at the Green Valley one, where I felt bias from our server, which was evident from the poor service and lack of water refills and bread, compared to the tables surrounding us. A bit of a slap on the face to see them patronizing the ladies sitting next to you with the attentive service. Kind of overt if you ask me. Normally my dad tips really well too but he had it with this kind of service. I tip 15-20% but he tips 30-40%, sometimes 100%. So back to this location. I ordered spaghetti.

Sorry, nothing exciting here. Just had a craving for plain old spaghetti and giant meatballs. Which is what I got, fat meatballs and spaghetti that was cooked right. The sauce is salty enough and you get a heaping plate of noodles that can feed two. And the server treated us like everyone else, as in didn't tell us that they didn't have any rolls and then bring it out to the next table 3 minutes later, or the table across from them a few minutes later. Yeah, we got the point. You won't catch me going to Green Valley Cheesecake Factory again. Generally, I always liked CF, from Caesars to Boca Park to GV, to every other one I tried in LA and Seattle. But certain experiences ruin a place for you. CF is good, but in this town, there's a ton of places you can go to get pretty much the same thing."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory location was very busy with a long wait- though our table was ready when they said it would be. The dulce de leche Cheesecake was 5 stars for sure- everything else from service to food was good, not great. We definitely had enough leftovers for another full meal, which made the price right."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about the chain. Fancy seating and lighting. I've been here a few times and its been hit and miss. The menu is massive! If you cant find something you want here you should just give up. If I could rate it a 3 1/2 I would. I had the Steak Diane last time and it was just ok. I can make it better at home. The cheesecake each time has been amazing! Each time it was a wait which isn't the most fun thing. Plenty of seating just not enough staff."}
{"text":"I ordinarily don't go to Vegas to eat at restaurants that I can eat at home but my first day in Vegas and I was just looking for some quick reasonably priced lunch before I went shopping so I settled for here. I came right as it opened and there was already a line forming to get inside. The seated everyone pretty quick though and had more than enough staff to accommodate everyone. I ordered the calamari and it was good. Ive had it before so I knew what to expect. My server was excellent. She was attentive the whole time and I always had what I needed. I was looking forward to enjoying their s'mores galore cheesecake but was very disappointed that they ran out. I wold think that at the beginning of the day they would have all flavors available so that was annoying. I opted for the white chocolate raspberry and I was not impressed. I expected to be better than it was so that was a bust. I did not spend a lot of time there. I just kind of got in and got out kind of thing so there is nothing else to really review. It was a pretty basic visit. Honestly I highly doubt that I would go back because there are better places to eat in Vegas that I don't have access to at home."}
{"text":"You miss the major point here which is quality of service as well as product. When we go out for a meal we would like to have a quality dining experience."}
{"text":"I'd have to say I was quite pleased with this place until my last experience. I went with a friend for lunch and we ordered two small plates. We waited 45 minutes for food, asked three times what was going on and was told that the food was coming. I finally asked for a manager, and he said he would check what was going on. Then finally our waiter came by and told us the order was never put in. They should've told us before we had to ask three times! So even after that happened, they did not take any money off of the bill. We should've at least gotten a discount or one meal free after they made us wait that long for a salad and a sandwich."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my nieces birthday huge mistake! We arrived at 845 and we're seated pretty quickly for a party of 10, it wasn't that busy. That's where the best part ends. It took about 15 min for the waiter Nate to get to our table to even ask for our drink order. Another 10 min pass before our order is taken and 10 min later he returns to inform one of our guests they are out of fried zucchini.... ok no problem.

Now 30 min pass and waiter informs a guest that they are out of steak... WTH.. At this point we are getting pretty hungry and you know they bring all food out together sooo further delay. An hour has passed and I get up go to the front and ask for a manager. Manager Rob appears and I explain we have been waiting an hour and the 30 min delay in finding out they were out of steak. He tells me that the order hadn't been back there long as if I were lying, I was literally pissed! He proceeded to say he would look into it. 

I see him in the kitchen area talking to his staff and after another 15min some of the food starts appearing. Crazy part mine appeared last.  Some birthday celebration I lost my appetite.      Needless to say I will never return. Maybe smaller parties have better luck but this service was horrible."}
{"text":"It's all in the name!!!! This is The. Best. Cheesecake. Ever!
I bring my family here to have a great time and to share a cheesecake!
My relatives recently travelled from Illinois and had never been.... Let me tell you, they thoroughly enjoyed it!! 
Friendly service, fun atmosphere and for the icing on the cheesecake... It connects to the mall so we can shop off those extra calories!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch recently, and despite the steep prices, I wanted to try the place. I've never had their food and everyone raves about it. 

The menu was so long and almost daunting. I ended up going with my safety and ordering the Pit Dip, which was alright, but nothing special. A little too sticky and there were odd bits of lettuce in the cheese (when the sandwich does not contain lettuce). Wasn't a fan. The fries were OK, but considering I paid $15 for my lunch, I expected something a little better. 

I'm not sure if the massive menu is just their thing or not, but it made things harder than they needed to be for decent quality food that definitely wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I have ever had. Waited for over an hour and then was given uncooked pasta that took over 45 minutes to cook uncooked again. Then proceeded to wait a half hour for cheesecake to come out. Terrible service all around and was there for over 2 hours. Will not be back, if ever trying to go to Cheesecake Factory the one in Southside is much more efficient."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Henderson. Consistent food and friendly service. Pro tip - open seating at the. At when it is busy. Love the brown bread, ask for the BBQ ranch to dip your bread in. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived at 5pm on a Friday and chose to sit in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour offerings. Seating was plentiful throughout the restaurant. Ambiance was inviting and appearance was clean. Server was pleasant and offered advice when I had questions. At 6pm, the lights were dimmed and atmosphere became more intimate. 

We both ordered spicy chicken sandwiches for our main course but started with the happy hour discounted nachos as an appetizer. Drinks were discounted (a dollar or two for draft beer). We soon found that our sandwiches, which were large and well prepared (if a bit light on sauce), were completely unnecessary. The nachos were significantly discounted, plentiful, decadent, and delicious! I highly recommend them. Chips must be fried on-site and have a unique, welcome taste to them. They aren't meant for anyone on a diet, as they're loaded with cheese and toppings.

We had to pack up our sandwiches after taking a small taste only to check the flavor while still hot. In the future, I would order one or the other. Not both. We also ordered an Adam's Peanut Butter Cheesecake to go and enjoyed it later. Hands down the best I've had."}
{"text":"I love cheesecake factory, however don't get it to go... The serving sizes are much smaller and it seems like they skimp out more on the meats in your salad or pasta.

Also for how expensive their cheesecake is, they give the tiniest pieces!"}
{"text":"Even when they were crowded, they seated us quickly.  Our server was efficient and our food was typical Cheesecake Factory fare. We will be ordering dessert and plan to return the end of the month for Cheesecake Day."}
{"text":"Really love this place.  It has been several years since I ate at one (probably while I was still living in Columbus - and that was over six years ago).  Sadly, I live in Columbia, SC, and this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to where I live.  My sister loves it here (well mainly for their cheesecakes), so we decided to make a small road trip up here several days ago.

Unlike the name suggests, you can order more than cheesecakes here.  Even though we were originally going to have lunch here, we decided just to stick with cheesecake for dessert. Looking at their menu (briefly might I add and going on when I actually did have dinners here), you can get your typical dinners here (chicken, stekas, pizza) and price wise, it is the about the same as other dinner places you might go to.  The menu does seem overwhelming (as we were only looking for desserts) as this particular location was also running ads for other businesses in the area (not aure if all locations do this as well).

Loved the decor as well.  It made you fell like you were eating at a classy place without having to be overly dressed and not paying over the top prices either."}
{"text":"The 2  is just because the CS from Georgina M other than that the food wasnt good, the chicken on the Bellagio was uncooked, the white beans on the White chx chili were hard It is very sad to see the great neglect of each of the cooks and the lack of responsibility from the chef!"}
{"text":"We usually eat here at least once while in town.
This time, I really wish we had not.
Sunday morning, 11 am and not too busy.  10 minute wait.
Get seated by hostess and 5 mins later our waitress comes for our drink order and says she will bring bread.  5 mins later our drinks come  Not bad.
15 mins later, no waitress, no water, no iced tea, no bread.  I am looking around like... hello?
Another 5 mins and nothing happens.  I get up and have to flag down some other server for my iced tea and ask for our bread.  \"I'll check\" he says.
A few mins later HE brings the bread, not our waitress.  
Then she comes by \"oh sorry, they were baking it\" - BS., I could see other tables being brought bread all the time.
5 more mins go by and she then comes back for our order.  2 entrees and a salad.
My salad comes a few mins later with the tiniest portion of dressing on the side.  I finish the dressing with 1/2 the salad to go.... huh?  I start looking around for 'someone' to ask for more dressing.  Literally nobody there even looking around to help me.  Then our server brings the food... \"here is your order, are you done with your salad?\".  Uh, no I needed more dressing but I could flag nobody down to bring me any more.  \"Do you want me to get you more dressing now?\".

I tell her no, I don't have that long to wait.

Bottom line, the food was great.  The service SUCKED.  Worst ever at a Cheesecake Factory.  And they were not busy!  There was no excuse for it.  Our server had an attitude and just did not care about her customers at all.

I left in a really pissed off mood."}
{"text":"The food has been good every time we visited this location (hope we don't have a bad experience after writing this review lol)."}
{"text":"I went for my second time last night with my hubby & the waiter, named Matthew, was amazing! He was so funny & everything we ordered got there quick. He was great at helping my indecisive husband make up his mind & our drinks seemed to never end (meaning he always refilled it at the right time) hahaha, definitely going back & hoping he's with us again! Matthew has an amazing attitude!"}
{"text":"Food great
Crazy at 7.00 pm lights automatically dimmed in entire restaurant and guests were eating by cell phone light"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here last night. We waited two and a half hours for a table. After I was told it was going to be about an hour and a half. So we patiently waited. Finally got a table. As we sat and waited for a waitress. We had the host come up to frantically asking what are we doing here. I said we were seated here. She was obviously annoyed. She didn't seem to believe me for some reason. She accused us of just coming here to this table and sitting down. She questioned a couple of times telling us how she will check us in and I'll be back. I am not sure why she thought we stole this table for I actually went up to her earlier to ask if our table was ready. So she knew we were waiting for over two hours. But because she wasn't around when we got called she got very upset. But to accuse of stealing after getting a table after 2 and a half hours and starving is absolutely ridiculous. The only reason I gave 2 stars is cause the food was decent and the waitress was very nice. The waitress was very apologetic for the host rudeness and couldn't believe what she did. So I am done with this place. It is absurd to wait so long for food that is just ok. There is nowhere to wait or stand. But to be treated as a criminal, I am done."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Vancouver so when I saw this location at yorkdale I was very excited to bring my friend to try out. 

I praised about cheese cake factory while waiting to be seated. Wait was not bad on a Friday afternoon.  Its a huge restaurant and it was very BUSY.  After we sat we waited for about 10 mins for the server to come and introduced himself to us. We ordered drinks to start , passion fruit mojito and red sangria. Both tasted good. As we were waiting for the drinks , our table got transferred over to a female server. She informed me that the drinks are in and if we are ready for the food order. 

Food:
I ordered 1. Tomato Basil Pasta 
                 2. Fried Calamari  and  
                 3. Sweet potato fries 
I was okay that it took nearly an hour for the food to be served due to the high volume of customers they have. HOWEVER, disappointment started from the first bite of the pasta. it was soo HARD, as if they were microwaved, more like dried up pastas.  And some of the pastas were okay which kind of confirmed my guess.  The calamari tasted okay but the two sauces that came with it tasted canned/ bottled.  We expected the wait for the food so we ordered the fries as we thought the fries should be the simplest item on the menu and that it shouldn't take too long, but actually IT was the item that came after we half through the other two dishes.  

Service:
Our female server seemed like a cool girl because she barely smiled when she came to serve us and the other table in front of us.  She came to check on us once during the whole meal, and once with that other tables.  Most of the times I saw her standing at the bar and chatting with the bartender.   However my thought on her being a cool girl changed when I saw her joked and laughed really hard with another table; three guests, Caucasian, in another word \" white people\" and I realized that my table and one of the guests at the table in front of us were Asians. 

One thing that I felt funny was that she had the guts to stared at the machine while I was paying the bill.  I tipped 15%, I don't think she deserves more than that however her attitude changed the moment she saw the slip. That was too little? lol  

Overall, my thought on this location is that they don't really care about how good or bad the service and the food is because #1, this location is in Yorkdale, and #2, with the good service and food provided by all other locations people will come and dine here.   But personally this is the first and the last visit for me."}
{"text":"I have to update and downgrade my review to 4 stars for this Cheesecake Factory. Although the food is always good here, they haven't been quite as consistent at delivering top notch dishes like my first 2-3 visits. My girlfriend and I have noticed that the quality can vary even when ordering the same dish. Neither the food nor service has ever been bad, however, and the desserts are always exceptional!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch. Interior is very spacious, lots of booths and seats, along with a bar. Also has a restroom too! Chris was our server and he was very friendly and funny. Overall, awesome food and service! I got the Renee Lunch Special (Chicken Almond Salad Sandwhich + House Salad + Mexican Chili Soup) and it was a pretty big portion! Very satisfied, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Service was good and cheesecake was good as always. But one thing I always frustrating about thus place is I'm getting same pasta most of times but always little different. This time pasta was not fully cooked.other than that it was alright."}
{"text":"I had cheesecake before and it is delicious! However dining here today for the first time was not so great. We watched several tables get their food before us even though we arrived before them. When our food did arrive, I asked the waitress what was the holdup. She admitted that she had forgot to put our order in.  Egads!  We had already been waiting 45 minutes during a not so particularly busy time.
When are bill came, I expected to see a small discount or similar due to her error that she admitted to. But no. The food was fine for the most part, a little on the pricey side for what it was. I just don't see what all the excitement is about of this place."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited the Boca Park location and experienced exceptional customer service from the manager, Sarah. Sarah went out of her way to ensure our satisfaction with our visit, and it meant a lot.  We also enjoyed the food (I had the cheesesteak and my fiancé had the chicken marsala), but will definitely come back because of Sarah."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would.  The first attempt at a meal tasted like cardboard with slop and soggy mushrooms on it...it was supposed to be chicken picatta.  Attempt #2. Steak tacos that while barely edible came with a side of crunchy Green rice- that was not edible.  Both attempts took FOREVER.  Service completely SUCKED.  Manager was polite but not effective in speeding replacement meal along.  So after nearly 2 hours I will just grab a McDonald's and call it a night.  #No Good. #Don'T bother. #SaveYourselfTheHassel"}
{"text":"So, this place is pretty good. I like it. The free bread and good service. I ordered the seared salmon salad. It was really good. Fortunately and unfortunately, the portion was sooooooo biiiiiig! I could not enjoy a cheese cake here. Maybe next time. Overall, I like this place and I'd come back."}
{"text":"Someone please fix those outside tables! I enjoy coming here so much and when I do I like to sit outside with my family, but those tables are as unsteady as they come. Something is wrong when the waiter and you are adding menus and napkins on the bottom to avoid the table from being woobly. No concern with the food, everything is delicious and waiters are usually friendly, just fix those tables please!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. The service was awesome! The food was delicious and of course the cheese cake was amazing! Our waters were always filled. Restrooms were super clean. you can never go wrong with cheesecake factory! I loved how some servers are out at work. Wearing rainbow ties. :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  good portion size, speedy service,  easy parking, and amazing cheesecake."}
{"text":"If you look past the wait time and how busy the restaurant was then I had a great time . I knew going in the wait time was gonna be long so I wasn't that mad when she told me I had to wait to wait an hour , she took down my name and gave me those beeper things so I walked in the mall till it beeped , be careful not to walk too far from the store or you'll get out the distance that it can reach the signal. 
The staff were really nice , the atmosphere was amazing ! Quite romantic with a fake candle in front of us and more cutlery than usual LOL now that's fancy . 
We ended up only going for appetizers and cheesecake . Got the factory nachos which were superb , and the cheese sticks which were sooooo good . I'm still thinking about those the next day wanting more . The cheesecake was good too , we got the classic strawberry cheesecake . Not too bad . The prices were a little high compared to jack Astor's or pickle barrel but I think the things you get with the price gives it a pass. The experience was amazing all in all . 100% would go back !"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at your Las Vegas premium outlet location. They said they were all out of cheesecake after we sat there for over an hour eating our dinner and we had ordered our cheesecake at the beginning of our meal. The waitress kept coming back and saying they were out of all of the flavors we wanted and that was 5 different flavors that we attempted to order. No apologies and then the manager basically said oh well we don't have any thing for you. Very unhappy"}
{"text":"The cheesecakes are exquisite 
However as always waiting time to get in is a pain, if you really wanna try the restaurant out of hype, better come on a week day  at their opening time or an our before open the time, to get u a secured seat before lunch time. 
Food wise we ordered few things, best is the calamari. The gambos are good too, however my steak wasn't cooked the way i want it to be so i have to ask them to cook it a little bit more. 
The restaurant is really busy, if you're looking for a peaceful place to dine or have a relaxed dinner i wouldn't recommend it. 
Bakery is more accessible for take out although you need to wait as well for your favourite cake slices.
I am a cheesecake lover so i would say their cheesecake are really yummy"}
{"text":"I really like The Cheese Cake Factory desserts, food is not that amazing but is not bad at all. Since I am a student from the Art Institute I use to take lunch in this restaurant but today service was denied to me because I was trying to take lunch on the patio area and have my dog with me, my dog is a 7 week Schnauzer mini toy puppy...That was RIDICULOUS!
A 3 pound puppy inside her cage won't hurt nobody...
But that's ok, I will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location, and definitely not the last. The Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE restaurant, I am always at the location in Los Angeles which is where I'm from. 

Since it was a Friday night it was about a 30-minute wait and I got there around 6:15 PM. There were a lot of parties waiting - for graduations, and also it's Father's Day weekend. The 30 minutes went by quick though, as I was looking through the menu and picking out a cheesecake to order for dessert in their display. 30 minutes is such a nice waiting time, and didn't seem that long especially because the one I go to in LA has a wait time that goes almost 2 hours! It's crazy. 

I ordered a strawberry lemonade with a Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms - it was in a wine sauce with bow tie pasta around it! It was delicious and I loved the plating. My uncle got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with shrimp and chicken and it was so yummy. Not too spicy at all!

We also ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. I liked it. I've tried almost every cheesecake and this just crosses it off my list! Took two bites and had to take it to go because I was too full. 

Our waiter Brittany was very attentive and nice and checked up on us! Definitely a plus when waiters/waitresses come and check on us every so often rather than waiting for one to come by. 

Wish it wasn't so hot outside, maybe next time I'll sit outside and enjoy the view! (And all the cars driving by lol)."}
{"text":"I finally made it in. Only waited one hour, not bad. The service was great, our server was Basil and he was awesome. Checked up on us, filled our water, had suggestions for what to eat. The food was fresh, we had the bacon burger and it was very tasty. The fries were crispy and hot. I took the red velvet cheesecake to go and I'm still working on it. It's a big portion and so satisfying on these blah winter days. The prices are a little steep so sharing a meal is always an option. I will return, had no concerns."}
{"text":"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory locations all over the country, but I have to say the manager, Jason, was the most unprofessional manager I have ever come across. I ordered over $100 worth of take out. Once I got the food home, I noticed that the avocados were missing from both of the chicken and avocado salads. I called the restaurant and spoke to Jason. To start, Jason voiced that they only add 2 ounces of avocados to a a salad that has avocados listed in the name.  He was rude and did not offer an apology for the error.  Jason then asked me to come back all the way from home to pick up my 2 ounces of avocados for each salad.  After I told him I was too far to return, he stated he would send me a gift card worth $20 for what he stated was for two slices of free cheesecake. He did not even care that I paid $15 for each salad and spent over $100 overall. He disregarded my cost and said he was only sending the card for the missing avocados. I told Jason his disregard was unprofessional and that I would write to corporate. He said to go ahead and started playing with the telephones buttons, pretending he was having phone issues, and hung up. Jason is not management material. Needless to say, I will not go back to this location as long as the restaurant is managed by a person who is clearly not cut out for management."}
{"text":"Went for the first time to TCF..... I had the Cuban and salad it was delicious and so fresh.... Very big portion I had to take half of my sandwich with me. My friends had the soup of the day which was clam chowder which they loved. But the cheesecake was outrageous!!!! We split the dulce de leche and the peanut butter..... Now the only question is...... What will I have next time"}
{"text":"We went to the Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Yorkdale Mall on Sunday morning around 11:30. The place was already packed. We were able to get a table without waiting. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the waitress was very friendly. The restaurant was very noisy. The service was kind of slow, but I expected that because it was very busy.

We started with the calamari. The calamari was good, but not very hot so it seems like it had been precooked. I had the fried chicken with Eggs Benedict. My brother had the fried chicken with waffles. He thought that the chicken fried chicken was overcooked and dry. My brother though that his food was okay. I thought that my fried chicken was good. It came with potatoes and waffles. But when I finished eating everything, I was very full and couldn't order any cheesecake.

Would we go back? Probably to tried their famous cheesecakes."}
{"text":"First time visiting this CCF.  Very noisy and not enough light to see the menu, had to use flashlight on phone to read the menu.  I was surprise they did not have many vegetarian items... Had the super anti-oxidant salad which was very small  less than half the size of the salads I used to get last time I visited.  I wish there were more of the fruits  as the menu stated but mostly just greens and not very filling.... As for the cheesecake I received the littlest piece of cheesecake ever less than one inch thick and it was on the sour side.....They were out of my favorite Key Lime....They said they would send me a gift card for a free slice, paying $8 for a sour slice of cheese cake not good.....I was not impressed, the waitress was great but the food did not wow my taste buds, everything was just boring."}
{"text":"Well, we went here on a Monday night to celebrate a birthday.  We made a reservation for 730pm and waited until 8pm to be seated, they kept telling us they did not have any seats for a party of 5 - their reasoning for the long wait.  They were also under staffed and did not have enough cooks on this day which added to the longer than average wait time for food.  Whitney, our waitress was very helpful and accommodating.  

We waited over 30 minutes for our food and by the time we ordered the food, the place was half empty so no real reason why it would take so long except to say the manager should have called in more help, but didn't.

The Kale and Quinoa app salad is bigger than small like the waitress said and can be a full meal in itself.  I had to send it back because they first brought it out without any Quinoa and grapes, when I got it back the 2nd time it was loaded with flavor, grapes and Quinoa plus the buttermilk dressing was excellent with it.   Also the incredible egg plant sandwich on brown bread was a hit and actually it was much better eaten alone instead of with the bread.  The Chinese chicken salad was just okay nothing to rave about as was the rest of the food - just ok - fettuccine, market burger, lettuce wraps, just ok nothing wow..  The cheesecakes again were just ok nothing to rave about - the banana cream needed more banana flavor and more cream, the mango key lime needed to be a bit more tart and the guey yellow stuff on top of the mango key lime is terrible and should be taken off.  the only cheesecake which was good was the original.  This place is hit and miss - sometimes everything is amazing and other times well just ok...."}
{"text":"I visited this location a couple of weekends ago. I was alone and just wanted to have lunch before I went to see a movie. I was seated in a section that was pretty much empty. I was placed in a corner and no server over to my table for 10 minutes. I even went so far as to make eye contact with a server and wave at her and she just looked away. I got up and went to the hostess station and told them that I wasn't going to wait ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I am a former server, bartender and host and I feel like this is unacceptable for the staff to flat out ignore someone."}
{"text":"Food and service here were great. Sat up in the bar. No complaints. Food came out fast. A+"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my mom here. Food was delicious..as always. Service was good. No complaints. Good location and plenty of parking. A+"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here twice. Just love the Skinnylicious menu they have. Such a nice alternative to the stuff that is higher in calories and fat. Service was perfect both times. Able to get a table without a wait. A++"}
{"text":"My experience at The Cheesecake Factory began on a good note as I was lucky enough to have not waited to get in! And the good continued...

Our server was pleasant and took the time to talk to us much longer than a server would normally have time for. I later learned that this is because servers here only have 3-4 tables at a time - probably because they just opened?

We ordered a couple dishes - a Pizza-Style Chicken Parmesan and the Chicken Bellagio, one of their best sellers.

Both dishes were HUGE and surprisingly decent, though not overwhelmingly (come here for portions, not for great food). And as always, the cheesecakes were decadent and delicious.

I'm typically not a fan of ubiquitous chain restaurants, especially restaurants with hundreds of items on the menu (e.g. Pickle Barrel), but The Cheesecake Factory exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"This was my first-ever visit to The Cheesecake Factory. This place seems to get mixed reviews, but I thought it was pretty solid, especially for a place that tries to do it all. Usually, I get worried when a restaurant has 20 pages of items on the menu because let's face, there's no way they can get them all right. But my shrimp & sausage lunch pasta was decent and the cheesecake was rich and delicious. Not bad, not bad at all."}
{"text":"The cheese cake factory was good. Only went for dessert. I liked it but the floor was slippery and didn't have a sign. Also huge overflowed trash can in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory located on Rampart in Las Vegas NV has definitely improved their game. Finally!!

Restaurant was clean. :)

Hosts were friendly. :)

Matt our server was OUTSTANDING!! :)

Food was cooked perfectly and my Cobb salad was delicious!!! :)

Chefs are doing a wonderful job preparing and plating food. EXCELLENT! :)

Looks like Cheesecake Factory is definitely back to a restaurant worth recommending! Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"I have only done take out from this location, but every time, the orders have been perfect. My company stays late during the end of the month, and we usually order about 10 meals on a Friday night. They are able to separate specific meals into different bags per our request, and they are always correct. The employees working the Carry Out are always very nice and accomodating. It is also very nice how they will bring your meals directly to your car, which would be very nice if you had a car full of kids! We keep ordering from Cheesecake Factory month after month.

The food is always great and my coworkers love the Skinny Licious menu! It is nice to have a healthy option at a place that was made from cheesecake."}
{"text":"Waited for almost 2 hours for a table. Food was decent, mostly a fried menu. Portions are really big but honestly I don't think it's worth the hype. 

Service was slow, they forgot one of our starters but they didn't charge us for it and brought it at the end for free. 4 out of 5 for good customer service and for being the only restaurant I've been to that's trading publicly."}
{"text":"We had the wierdest waitress, she said she had been there for several years but she was really blah about it all. the food is always good here, and they have good green tea."}
{"text":"BIG fan of the Cheesecake Factory franchise ever since I've tasted their Red Velvet Cheesecake. This was my first visiting this location of The Cheesecake Factory.  We checked in at the front desk and the lady said the wait time will be 5-10 mins and got seated at 8 mins. Kinda nice knowing we were seated within the allotted time because we know TCF gets extremely busy.

We started off with  \"Warm Crab And Artichoke Dip\" due to \"Fire Roasted Fresh Artichoke\" not being available which is kinda disappointing, we really wanted to try it and \"Stuffed Mushrooms\" which is really good, kinda sad they only serve a small portion of it because it's my favorite. 

For entree, our party ordered the \"Pasta Da Vinci\" \"Fresh Grilled Salmon\" \"Herb Crusted Fillet Of Salmon\". What I like about TCF over the larger restaurant chains the food never lets you down. The food portions are always large to share with others. 

Leave some room for desserts though. As we didn't so we ordered for takeout. No matter what you are craving when it comes to cheesecakes you will not go wrong. I recommend the red velvet and the salted caramel. Oh boy what a surprise because I thought nothing could top the Red Velvet.

The customer service was super slow, our server hardly dropped by to fill up our water. But I sorta understand seeing how busy the place was. So we didn't think too much of it."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience at this location. My server was rude and very short with us when we asked why our food was taking so long when other customers that came In 10 minutes after us already had their food, she instantly sent the manager over when we did not ask for him. The manager Chris Branch was very unprofessional and rude, he lacked the basic customer service skills that every employee should know. We waited 45 minutes for our food while we \"enjoyed\"our burnt appetizers, our waitress was no where to be found to tell her that we would like them remade. We didn't get to eat together the plates were brought out 10 minutes apart and 2 of the dishes were wrong we didn't have time to have the dishes remade because we had a child with us and the manager still charged us for the disappointing food and terrible service I expected more from this location."}
{"text":"Went here for late night apps the other day, since they are open pretty late. First impression walking in I noticed it was too dark. I been to many cheesecake factories and I know they tend to be dim lighting but this 1 was overly dark. The floors weren't clean at all, they were very slippery and the booth bench had food on it still. I don't like to complain so I didn't. The speed of the waiter was fine a little on the slower side but no harm. We got nachos, avocado eggrolls, and the fries platter with mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries. Overall the food was good. I recommend the avocado eggrolls. The nachos weren't the best slightly oily and seems like they went cheap on the ingredients. The fries were good. The main reason I gave them 2 stars is because of the cleanliness, if the floors and booths aren't clean where the guess are can you imagine the inside?"}
{"text":"Last month we went to this location for my 18th birthday party. To start off a good night, our waiter was extremely friendly and outgoing. He cracked jokes along with him and did a very good job throughout the night. He appropriately checked up on us and made sure our glasses were never empty. The food was very good as well, and the portions were worth the money!

The best part about is was that the waiter asked if I wanted happy birthday sung to me. I wasn't scared out of my wits when a sudden horde of waiters and waitresses sprung up on my family to sing to me. The cheese cake was decorated with a cute birthday message and was large enough for all three of us to share. We had a wonderful experience and would happily go back on our next occasion! (Written by daughter)"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about. We had some cheesecake and coffee just before close. Got a table right away and the service was good."}
{"text":"First time dining Cheesecake Factory in Canada.  Place look all like other location in US.  Food was sooooo disappointing.  I ordered the New York steak, asked mild well and got raw w/ blood running on the plate and the steak was so tough and seasoning was so salty, only good part was mashed potatoe and green beans. I paid $29.99. Service was so horrible, our waitress was condescending and rude when my friend asked for a small glass for her coke drink and she rolled her eyes. Last I checked good service equal good tips.
Overall, this will be my only and last time dining here.  Overrated!!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot just because of the cheesecake.   I just love it.  But dining here sometimes makes you don't want a come back. The reason why is my food never come out right sometimes.  The tables inside are so close to each other.  That's why I like seating outside. The food is a lot.  This place is always busy too.  Anyway, overalI I will still come back hehehe.  Can't stay away from those cheesecake."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to TCF, but we had a pair of gift cards to cash in on, so off we went.  Without trying to be literary or sound like an expert reviewer, I will just be direct here.  My soft shell shrimp taco was very bland tasting, as was the sauce it came with (needs a better, tastier sauce), as was my Greek salad.  The crab bites were very good though.  My wife's chicken sandwich was \"average, at best\", in her own words.  And my daughter's chicken fingers were good, but her fries way too salty.  In dissapointment, she barely touched them.  Her chocolate cake was mediocre too.  My wife and I split a carrot cake, which was delish.  Average, way overrated and overpriced food (our bill for 3 came to about 95 dollars), a long wait to get seated, and a long wait to get our food as well.  That said, our excellent server Alyssa was so utterly professional and kind, that I would have felt bad telling her that I didn't like the food there.  So there.  Would I return?  I don't think so.  Maybe just to take out some cheesecake, that's it.

UPDATE: March 2018
I went back to TCF because our dear friends wanted to go there.  Since it was a while since I had been there before, I went online to see what the menu looked like, and I was shocked that there was NO nutritional info available!  Really, I thought?  In 2018, no less?!  What are they trying to hide?  Pathetic."}
{"text":"Took parents here for Mother's Day. Fantastic food and service."}
{"text":"My hubby, daughter and I came here for lunch August 16, 2017. We were at Queens Center Mall doing a little shopping and decided to stop at this newly opened location for lunch. Well I must say this place is very good. We enjoyed everything we ordered. We had the loaded bake potato tots which was sooo yummy and cheesy. We also ordered the chicken pot sticker dumplings. My goodness so delicious . For our entree's my hubby had the chicken Parmesan pizza style which he loved, loved, loved. My daughter had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken. She loved it! I had my Shrimp scampi over linguini which was so amazing. Our server was very professional and attentive to our needs. We will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with the Cheesecake Factory and I have been to a few, Palo Alto and SJ, CA, Seattle, WA and now Phoenix, AZ.  Love the food, the portions, vast selections of appys', entrees and desserts.
Hate the wait and lack of reservations.  The Biltmore Hotel called in a reservation for us for a table of 8 for 6:30pm on Sunday.  It wasn't a reservation, nor a pseudo reservation, we ended up being seated at 6:50 pm.  If you don't get there (any of the restaurants early, before 5pm, expect a wait.)

I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, $15, extremely yummy and enough to share with 5 others and chicken and biscuits, $21, enough for 3 meals.  The biscuits are airy like Marie Callenders corn bread, I got 3 chicken breasts and plenty of gravy.  Friends ordered the Steak Diane, excellent mushrooms, miso salmon, shepards pie, just to name a few.  Everything was so good.

The downside of our experience at this restaurant was the ordeal of no reservation and our waiter was inattentive, we had to ask for our drinks and appy's.  Had to ask the manager to find out what was going on with our waitstaff and order.  Hopefully, this was not the norm at this location."}
{"text":"Always find the food at Cheesecake Factory so yummy! This time I ordered the herb crusted salmon...comes with a nice serving of salmon, asparagus, and mashed potatoes! It was delish! I gotta give props to our waitress Jessica...she totally rocked with her quick service!"}
{"text":"I would like to start this review by stating I am more of a Grand Lux Cafe kinda gal. I personally don't LOVE the Cheesecake factory, although they must have caught me on a good day because I loved this particular meal!

The menu is huge. I am watching my figure, so I stuck to the Skinny menu. I ordered the Pear Pizza and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely go back just for this. 

I also had a few mojitos, they were all very tasty. 

Last but certainly not least, a S'mores cheesecake. AMAZING!!!!! It was everything I loved about camping without all the inconvenient stuff (like living outside). I cant wait to try this again!! 

The service is always decent at this location. I do have one bone to pick though, WHY do I always seem to get stuck in the super skinny booth??? I felt like I could eat off my booth neighbors plates. I hate that! Next time I am eating at the bar."}
{"text":"Brunch? Raw, doughy waffle? Really? Not like it was a Tuesday night ordering a waffle. Even asked for the toppings on the side, so it would not get soggy. This is AFTER we sat for 8 minutes with no hello. Suzy finally appeared. Asked her if the large table in this section was going to hinder our experience? She soooooooo snotily replied she could move us if we wanted. Continued a very condescending attitude. This was BEFORE the waffle issue. Manager offered something else, we declined. Didn't want FREE food. We wanted lunch and cheese cake. We got neither. Will not return."}
{"text":"My 50th Bday I ate here for the first time. Beautiful decor and wonderful nice staff. The food was amazing! I had Nachos and of course cheesecake. I like the large booths for privacy. I will return soon! Thank you"}
{"text":"I went to this place last night. First time I went to the Cheesecake Factory. I got the chicken lettuce wraps the Asian ones and they were so good. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone that is in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Service was great, waitress was nice and friendly. But it was a first time when I get disappointed with food in Cheesecake. It was very oily and salty. Mushrooms wasn't cooked enough. Avocado rolls was ok but still had too much oil."}
{"text":"***PROS***
* Short wait for table - 10 mins
* Attentive waiter - never hungry, thirsty, or wondering where he was
* Great food! We had 4-cheese pasta which tasted like a pizza with so much flavor, herb-crusted, grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes that were wonderful, and tempura-battered fish tacos with chipotle sauce, pickled red cabbage, salsa and guacamole that was delicious. 
* Complimentary bread at table was warm and fresh, served with large pats of butter
* Strawberry lemonade had real strawberry seeds in it, sugar rim on the glass, and wonderful sour flavor. 
* Cheesecake to go was packaged with extra whipped cream and plenty of napkins & forks
***CONS***
The only \"con\" was that the waiter mentioned the computers were slow because of a Christmas coupon that was difficult to enter yet many customers were using. I wish we knew about the coupon. I'd say check their website for details, get on their mailing list, or follow their social media accounts for details."}
{"text":"If I could give two sets of stars, I would. Alas, since I cannot, The Cheesecake Factory shall receive a dreaded two star review. Better than one, but only just.

I want to like the factory of cheesecake, I really do. The food is mediocre and overpriced, the tables are too close for comfort, and the service leaves something to be desired. I have been here on numerous occasions and my experience is always the same.

Let's reflect on the most recent trip, shall we?
I came here with my sister and niece for a girls day. I warned them of my experiences ahead of time but my niece was set on a giant slice of cheesecake. There is no talking a member of my family down when it comes to sweets...

The new orange chicken dish was completely overpowering with orange flavor, and not in a good way. It left a bitter, syrupy taste...literally and figuratively. The Cajun chicken pasta was OK, but my sister had numerous pieces of gristle in her chicken and I found a tortilla chip in mine. I won't complain about a bonus chip, but I'm pretty sure it didn't belong there. After all that, they both agreed with my original statement, until the cheesecake came to the table...

This is where the second set of stars would come in handy. The cheesecake is damn good. I mean, take home a slice of each and eat it everyday until it's gone, good. I have had better, but not by all that much. I would give the cheesecake a four star review. Creamy and rich with just enough of whatever makes it different...Oreo, raspberries, or whatever else. So in conclusion, The Cheesecake Factory should stick to that of it's name and leave the rest to someone else."}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order last night. They said it would be 15 minutes. So I drove straight there because that's about how long it takes to get there. I called once I got there like they asked and they said they would run it out. I sat there for 15 minutes...waiting. Called again. They said they would bring it out. 30 minutes go by. Nothing. Literally nothing. So I just left. 

THANKS FOR WASTING AN HOUR OF MY LIFE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. 


Nobody even called later to see if we got our order. How sweet???"}
{"text":"I had the chicken salad sandwich with the side salad.  The sandwich was cut into very narrow portions maybe 1 inch by 3 or so inches long.  I saw a lot of tomato and lettuce between those little strips of bread and very little chicken salad.  Hard to eat without it spilling out all over the place.  The chicken salad itself was very disappointing.  Very bland with virtually nothing in it. And that poor side salad - looks like a bagged salad mix of baby greens and other lettuces that came to me looking like the dressing had been poured on it and it had sat awhile,   it was completely wilted and limp.  Very unappetizing. I wound up eating part of my husband's Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich which was pretty good.  We decided to split a key lime cheesecake which is very good.

 I think this restaurant's forte is in the desserts."}
{"text":"After waiting for over an hour (also with 2 little kids )I finally get my $16.00 spicy chicken pasta and the noodles are hard... this isn't what I would expect after waiting so long. At this point I have no desire of waiting for them to bring me a new plate.  They didn't even offer to take it off the bill! There are tons of places to choose in this area I'm  not sure I will ever go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years now and it's become my favorite restaurant. This location, however, is my least favorite. I went in for dinner one night and had Michelle C as a server and it just seemed like she was in a bad mood and didn't want to be there that night. I'll take my business elsewhere thank you."}
{"text":"The servers are always attentive when we eat dinner here. The food is not and delicious. The longest we have had to wait for seating has never been longer than 10 minutes.  This place is mid range price with high quality food and staff. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Good club sandwich. Salads are huge and good. Large portions for the price. Cheescake so so."}
{"text":"It's the Cheesecake Factory.. a large chain restaurant with a massive menu. It's good, nothing crazy. The service was great though. Nice and friendly even on a busy Friday."}
{"text":"This is another toughie for me to review, for a variety of reasons. 

First of all, I like the decor and I like the ambiance of this place. It's not like most of the other restaurants (especially chains) in the area, and while pretentious, it at least outwardly appears fancier than you'd otherwise expect. There's also the lighting and a lot of windows, which is typically a plus in the early evening, so you can catch some of the sunset or watch the wind batting around the palm branches. 

Food and service, however, have never really impressed me at this location. I don't know if it is specific to this restaurant or if the entire chain is this way, but after multiple visits, my honest opinion is that their menu is way, way too big. They have immense variety, but as they say, jack of all trades and master of none. Case in point, nothing I have had here has been the best, or even remotely close, compared to what I've gotten elsewhere. 

I've tried the pulled pork, but I've had better almost everywhere else. Tried the burgers, but better can be had for far less money elsewhere. Appetizers are pretty much on the same page, things like pot stickers are literally no better than what you can buy in the frozen food section of your grocery store, there was nothing special about them. I've also given their pizza a try and it was some of the worst I've ever had anywhere -horrible, tasteless crust, nasty sauce and cheese that was just.. yuck.

I will concede that their dessert menu does offer a few delights that I have been happy with. The milkshakes, and the strawberry one in particular, were always sinfully good. I never could finish them because they were so huge, but at least they were delicious, unlike most of the food I've had there.  

In terms of service, there has been a lot of inconsistency in my visits. More often than not, it's below average service, slow drink refills and the like. Really gets my goat when I see the \"drink refill guy\" topping off every table but mine, despite the empty glass on the corner of the table, begging to be refilled. But then, he's not the server, so do you factor this into your tip? This is why I hate when restaurants job-share tables, it puts you in a position to have to punish a good server for a crappy drink service that was someone else's fault. Sigh.

Bottom line, I think, is that this place is trying to be too many things at once, with the not at all unexpected result of poor execution. Their menu has to be close to 20 pages, and it really doesn't help that there are paid advertisements in it on every page too. I don't know why they see the need to generate revenue that way, but it reeks of desperation and detracts horribly from the experience of dining in a faux-upscale restaurant, even more so than half-baked service.

My advice? Stay away until they slim down the menu and try to specialize, or at least only go for the desserts. The rest of their food is just adequate, at best, and definitely overpriced for what it is. Combined with the unpredictable service, I just don't see any reason to go back here."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to only wait 25 minutes for a table for 4 on a Saturday night!  They give you a beeper thing while you're wanting so you can always wait outside or shop in LLBean next door.
This restaurant had the largest menu I've ever seen. 
Our server Liz was great. The food was delicious.  Love the honey wheat bread with the oats! She stayed ahead of our drink refills which made me happy.
The hibachi steak melts in your mouth.  The shrimp bacon club sandwich was the size of my husband's head. 
The booths are also amazing because theyre technically for 6 so a family of 4 has plenty of room! 
Every Cheesecake factory o's the same and predictably great."}
{"text":"Eh. Came here Saturday 5/14 with my sisters. We got the avocado egg rolls which were delicious. I ordered the shrimp with angel hair. It was kind of pathetic. The shrimp was so dry and overcooked. Like way overcooked. It was also kind of spicy which I don't remember being in the description. The noodles were a little bland. This dish was nothing spectacular. Kind of a disappointment. I didn't want to be a pain so I didn't tell the waitress how bad it was. Next time we want to go out to dinner it won't be here."}
{"text":"Have always had a good experience here. The food is terrific and the service is, too. Don't be turned off by the sometimes long wait. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with meal & service!  Shrimp over cooked & tough. Charged $2.95 for each ice tea which is outrageous then charged for refills.We definitely will not be back. The service was terrible.  Slow very slow"}
{"text":"The All American Classic eatery! Today I had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and it was outstanding..I successfully washed it down with a Strawberry Lemonade!"}
{"text":"Not a chain food fan- but if you can get in to the Cheesecake factory it's always delicious.  Salads are great- plenty of vegetarian and healthy options!!"}
{"text":"I loved Cheesecake Factory when I lived in LA and this one is close to my house. At this one we were seated at a table where one person sits on a booth and the other pulls up a chair. The person next to us had a seafood entree that had such a strong odor that we couldn't enjoy our food. We like seafood but we were glad we did not order whatever this man's dinner was because it was overpowering. We did not have an enjoyable time because of that."}
{"text":"I don't go out of my way to visit The Cheesecake Factory, but my mother wanted to have an early dinner here for her 60th birthday.  We had a group of 13 and when I arrived I tried having them organize a table for us, but the manager said that she wouldn't do so until everyone arrived.  Even thought I explained that everyone was on the way she would not sit the 4 of us that were there early.  

Upon sitting down, our waiter was very accommodating.  Brought us all waters and took drink orders.  After browsing the extensive menu items I choose a turkey sandwich from the skinny menu.  Food took a while to come out of the kitchen & my niece waited the longest for some kid sliders.  I was literally done with my turkey sandwich before they brought out her sliders.  Not sure what happened in the kitchen to forget about 2 small sliders.  I'm not a fan of the decor of Cheesecake factory or the sitting arrangement made for a large party.  I felt trapped where they sat us.  

After dinner was over we all ordered some cheesecake, because why not?  We opted for the brownie sundae and a slice of cookie dough cheesecake.  No complaints in this department.  Both good options for dessert.  All in all I wouldn't eat here again.  The food is OK and the service is OK.  Some people rave about this place, but for the price of the food I know I can have a better dining experience somewhere else."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were taken to our table and sat there for over 10 minutes before even being greeted by a single person. The server assigned to the section next to us ended up asking if we had been greeted yet and ended up getting our drinks for us. Our server still took another 2-3 minutes before making it to our table. She asked us if she could get us any water, I said yes and asked for no ice please. She acknowledged my request and said absolutely. My water came back with ice (not a big deal at all) but that is the ultimate server test to see if you're server is actually paying attention. I manage a very high paced restaurant myself and that would never fly with my servers. Not to mention it's not even busy in here. Most likely won't be coming back to say the least."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Parking is almost always difficult and there are not many handicapped spaces. We were seated promptly and our server, Brooks, was great. Two of us were happy with the food, the lunch salmon and the orange chicken. My double bacon burger was excellent. My wife can not eat black pepper. In spite of the huge menu she could not find anything she could eat so she got breakfast food. Even with that, the fried potatoes had black pepper on them, they were supposed to have been made plain. All her favorites are gone so we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I would rather drive all the way to Buffalo, NY than come back here again. Heck it might even be faster. I was dreading coming here and only came as it was a family member's birthday. It looks exactly like all the other franchise locations you see in the USA except a little smaller.  

The Wait
Arrived early to reserve (3pm) and didn't get the table until about 3.5+ hours later. See? It's faster going to Buffalo! Guess we have to let the hype die down. 

Stroller
They don't let strollers inside due to limited space. There's a \"stroller valet\" outside the restaurant BEHIND the host area, right by the exit. Thank god our stroller isn't a top of the line stroller or we wouldn't want to leave it there. I know there are cameras, but if a stroller really got stolen I don't think Cheesecake Factory's going to compensate. 

Not Family Friendly
We had a baby (who needs a highchair) with us and they gave us a booth that had high traffic (right by the kitchen). Their reason for putting us there was we had 'wanted a table asap'. Well who doesn't? They weren't going to give us a highchair at all until I said I guess I HAVE TO put him on my lap then. What would they do for someone with a wheelchair? Seriously?

Customer Service
Our server was great. He was nice and also gave our baby some sliced bananas, but the manager (young guy with a red shirt) was extremely rude to my family when we inquired about the table. It had been a long wait and he actually threatened my MIL and said you'll have to wait even longer. I'm sure his job is stressful but WTF? That's no way to speak to a customer. 

Food
As expected. 

Not bothering with Cheesecake Factory in Toronto ever again!"}
{"text":"Service was good but when my daughter lost her parking token they were useless. Even though we had just dropped a $100 for a meal my daughter had to spend another $16 to get out of the lot. Comon folks lets get with technology! A validation shoukd be validated if warranted. Period!"}
{"text":"Too busy to make dessert for that special at home dinner - stop by Cheesecake Factory and pick up some dessert to go and you will be a dessert hero!  Don't forget to try the Pumpkin Pecan while it is available!"}
{"text":"Not the best Cheesecake experience. Out of the 5-6 times, this was the worst... here is why:

1. Missing items... No croutons on salad. No grilled onion on burger. No ranch as requested. 

2. Bread was refrigerated cold.

3. Seats were dirty. Gf had to grab a napkin from another table to wipe off the seat before she could sit down.

4. Walked passed a bus tub overloaded with dirty dishes just sitting in a booth... not a good impression walking to our table.

5. Fries were not hot.

The food and service were good. Wouldn't recommend or return to this location based on our experience though."}
{"text":"My gf and I had the absolute best experience the day after labor day!!!

We had the chicken nugget appetizer, perfect small size and sooooo good!

I had one of the special pastas. AMAZING!!! Seriously, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.

She had fish tacos?!? LOL She liked them a lot. Not what I go to Cheesecake for. But had enough pasta, didn't need to share. :D

Server was spot on! Food was hot, timely, and very pleasantly delivered!

Very impressed, especially after being disappointed from the Scottsdale location. Great job Cheesecake Arrowhead, we loved our dinner experience that night!!!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory has a pretty nice venue, but it seems to take in so many patrons  that they can't keep up with maintaining the store standards. The floors feel greasy and dirty when I went, and I even felt like I would have slipped if I wasn't careful. You can't reserve tables which sucks for how busy that place gets. Their menu is a little too big, and the drinks are way over priced. But they do have a nice venue and the food is actually pretty good as well. Not to mention the cheesecakes are awesome."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong. Shrimp scampi is great. Steak Diane very good. Louisiana chicken tasted exceptional. All my children and spouse loved their meals. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for John S. in the bar, was so personable! We came in late after a Rebel game and welcomed us with stellar service and always ensured our glasses were full and our food was hot. While we were there, I noticed some regulars who he was greeting by name and vice versa. Hospitality at it's finest - thank you John!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Great service, lots of room in the happy hour area and consistency. The host stand is in a little awkward of a spot but everything else makes up for it. 

PS. It's in the same complex as a Panera, Target, and Total Wines. Could it get any better??!"}
{"text":"This was our spot for happy hour followed with dinner three times a week. Skinnylicious menu: My favorite was the fire roasted artichokes with the skinny cosmopolitan. My honey enjoyed the happy hour burger with a tall glass of Stella. Other favorites include:

**Soy glazed edamame
Caesar Salad
Chinese chicken salad
**Miso Salmon
The club
White chicken chili
**Chicken marsala and mushrooms
Tiramiso cheesecake
**Pepermint bark cheesecake

The bartenders rock: **John, Greg, Vince and Chase. Sit in the bar area and you're set. Great atmosphere, conversation, drinks, food and five star service."}
{"text":"I have been to this location numerous of times. I prefer Crocker Park location over this one but because we were in the neighborhood we decided to go to lunch here. We were seated very quickly but it's took the waitress 20 minutes to even approach our table. So we decided to go to Granite city instead. Granite city was so delicious."}
{"text":"I had the white pizza, hubby had chicken fingers and 2-YES 2 crab puff appetizers! Very good. My only regret was that Pumpkin cheesecake is not in season so I had the Tiramisu, yum. 

Nice decor and atmosphere. Service was marginal. I had to ask for a tea refill after I was done with meal and dessert and waiter didn't have any other tables to look after. Tip reflected his neglectfulness. 

We shall return."}
{"text":"I love the cheesecake factory! Literally I go when I'm on vacation even. But all of the bartenders at this location are awesome, especially Mike! I can always go in and know that I will get the best service."}
{"text":"Holy menus Batman!! For those of you that have never tried the Cheesecake Factory, their menu is.....extensive. It's my personal belief that if your menu needs page numbers, you have too many things on the menu, but what do I know? The thing about CF is you have to remember their thing is cheesecake and they do that well. It's hard for me to say they do it any better than that, because really, I don't like cake, even ones made of cheese. As for the food, they have a ton of options and they are consistent. If you find something there you love, more than likely you will love it every time.  Like I usually get a pizza or this chicken BBQ salad which rocks! But is HUGE! 

Because we had stopped by before going to the movies, we were eating rather light. Two of us got the pizza and salad lunch for about $13.00, which was really reasonable considering the pizza is a decent size, AND you get to choose from any pizza toppings you want; I chose the chicken BBQ. Mmmmmm! The salad was literally just greens and a couple tomato quarters...not as Mmmmmmm.
The BF got the lunch size meatloaf, which was not really to his/our liking. It comes smothered in gravy and onions, and I am an anti-onion person. Everyone got desert- cheesecake, of course- and the best by far was the salted caramel. Coming in a close second was the raspberry lemon, which was very refreshing and, because it has a cake layer (or something, I can't really remember) it is one of the least bad for you, calorically speaking. The Hershey's chocolate was a dud. Just really chocolatey without any charm or pizazz. 

My parting advice would be to check out the menu on line BEFORE going, to narrow down you options, so you don't go into menu shock when you get there (seriously, it's like 14 pages)."}
{"text":"Not here to complain about the food , but about the service . I was with a party of 3 people and it took over 2  and a half  hours to be seated . Mind you parties of bigger groups or even 2 people that showed up after us had got seated before we even did ."}
{"text":"The place is wonderful except for the the Mac n cheese.  The Mac n Cheese was very watery.  When a toddler looks at it and starts to wonder what he or she is eating the food isn't prepared correctly.  
Atmosphere: outstanding 
Adult beverages: outstanding 
Food:good
Servers: great and fun
Cheesecake: awesome 
Overall experience: Better than average"}
{"text":"What a visit!

Fantastic service. Best server I've had. 

We find it's always good to skip a meal BEFORE eating here. The diet coke with lime; the bread; the Mexican corn cakes;  incredible!

For dinner: the smokehouse burger. I dare say . . . The best burger I have ever had. Maybe it was the moment. The bun was perfect and toasty. Bacon was crispy. Beef was perfect. Onion rings on the burger. Yummy BBQ-ranch sauce. And then cabbage rather than lettuce??  Oh yeah!  Crunchy and fresh.  I would highly recommend this burger."}
{"text":"I hate CF because my wife (and most women) hype it. Drives me nuts. The reality is, most things vie had there are very good. 

While on our anniversary trip we ate there twice in one day - not by choice. 

The appetizer with the corn cakes - very good!

We also had some salmon wraps on a bed of cabbage. It was very good!

The next meal (same day) I ordered the spicy chicken stuffed tortillas - or something like that. It was very good also. My wife got salads both times and loved each of them."}
{"text":"The Factory is winning with its appetizers. They aren't cheap, but from small plates to small salads, I don't remember having an app I didn't like. 

On my latest visit, I dared to try the fried Mac and Cheese balls. I kept wavering at first, because I couldn't imagine their mac and cheese tasting any different than a box of pre-packaged stuff lurking in my pantry. But whoa! The dish knocked my socks off. Can I get an AMEN for comfort?

The nicely fried balls were close to 2.5 inches round with large noodles mixed with creamy cheesy goodness. I don't know what blend of cheese is used, but I was happy that I couldn't taste american cheese. And it wasn't as greasy as you would think. The mac balls are topped with a tomato-cheese dip that also taste pretty good. Four balls cost $11.95

Avocado Egg Rolls (11.95) speak for themselves and the accompanying dip speaks for everything else: 
Six half rolls per dish are served on top of some useless white crunchy sticks that I ignore every time. I forgot to ask if I could substitute lettuce for them. At least then the egg rolls would be sitting on top of something pretty. Oh well, maybe I can save packing costs by using the sticks as padding for the next package I send for X-mas.

Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (10.95):
I've ordered this before and wanted to try a second time. Yes, it's a comforting dish. Sweet corn kernels are baked into three tamale pancakes and covered in garnish of avocado, pico, cream, and some kind of relish (which I just realized today) tastes very similar to Thousand Island.

Would I go to the Factory without ordering cheesecake? No, no I wouldn't. Ever since I had a good run with the Struessel (which they no longer carry unfortunately) I've been tasting other flavors. This time I decided on the Lemon/Raspberry, dulce de leche, and white choco/raspberry. Hmmm, I like all three."}
{"text":"The food is great as always but the manager was rude and not understanding. They said its a half hour wait to eat on the patio and hour wait to eat inside, we waited the hour to eat inside and they placed us at a table in the doorway-half of us sitting inside and half outside. Very awkward seating and the manager told us we either take this table or leave. We had waited so long we stayed to eat but it was awkward the entire time, being bumped by waiters coming in and out"}
{"text":"Came to Yorkdale around 4:00pm and waited in line for 30 mins to get the buzzer. Once you have that you can carry it and walk around. At first, they told us the wait time will be around 2-3 hrs, but around 2.5 hrs later, they call us and told us it will delay. At last, we waited until 9:30pm to get a table for 5.
We ordered tomato basil pasta, pasta carbonara, lemon garlic shrimp (forgot to take a pic) and herb crusted filet of salmon. I personally like the tomato basil pasta the best and for the salmon, it ain't too dry or tough but melts across your tongue.
Dessert time!! At first, we wanted to order coffee and cream chocolate supreme and tiramisu cheesecake but unfortunately were all sold out. So we changed to fresh strawberry, godiva chocolate and white chocolate raspberry truffle. They are smooth, creamy and also really huge (probably need to share or it will be too heavy).
Overall, the food is great but is it worth to wait for 5-6 hrs? Probably depend on.. are you going to buy stuff in the mall cuz actually every store also have lineups, so time actually passes super fast when you are shopping with your friends."}
{"text":"They did not disappoint. I've visited the Cheesecake Factory in the USA before and was so excited when I heard they were bringing it to Toronto. I heard iffy reviews but I had to go for myself and it was very good. We went on Sunday morning arriving around 11:00am, we were advised there was a 75-90 minute wait, which I already expected. We were given a buzzer, we only ended up waiting about 60 mins to get seated. The restaurant was very busy but all the staff was very pleasant. We had two different waitresses as they were having their break time, both waitresses were very kind and accommodating. One person dining with me wanted a breakfast plate with bacon and pancakes, it also came with eggs but they didn't eat eggs, so they were kind enough to omit the eggs and provide extra bacon in place of it. Other guests ordered a breakfast burrito, California cheesesteak. They all enjoyed their meals very much. 

As for my meal (pictures below) - I ordered a Peach Smoothie with the Four Cheese Pasta as my entree and an Oreo Cheesecake to go because I was too full from my meal. The smoothie was delicious, no complaints there. The pasta was good, it's the one dish I would always order in the US. It was slightly dry but once I mixed everything together it was perfect. The portion sizes are very large, when I was finished it barely looked like I ate any pasta as my plate was still full. Even the size of the smoothie, was large. 
The cheesecake portions are also large. I could barely eat half a piece to myself so definitely think about sharing a slice. 

All in all dinner was great, atmosphere is nice, it's a bit loud because of all the people but I would definitely dine here again. Hopefully more restaurants open in the GTA so reservations can be made and wait times can be made shorter. However, even when dining at the Cheesecake Factory in the US I usually had a 30-45 minute wait."}
{"text":"love the location. very clean,courteous, kind sums it up. We order 3 entrees and 1 appetizer. it is very delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent Cheesecake Factory and this last visit at this location was considerably underwhelming. We waited for nearly 30 minutes and requested a booth and was sat in the bar area in at a small section. We let it pass because it was considerably busy and we were hungry. Our server was less than par - he waited on every table except for ours for nearly 10 minutes before he even offered to take our drink order. When we finally got to order 20 minutes later it took an additional 25 minutes to get our food. No where in that time did our server check on us to see if we wanted refills and it wasn't until the table 6in away needed boxes did our server even check in on us. Once we got our food we were ready to go. We asked for our food to be boxed (as most other Cheesecake Factory's will box it for you and he had just boxed the couple's food next to us 10 minutes prior) he threw down 3 boxes (for whatever reason, there were only two plates on our toddler sized table) and when we asked for the check it took an additional 10 minutes to get and another 10 to have picked up. It's safe to say we won't be visiting this location or any other for a bit, it was majorly disappointing."}
{"text":"I was eating at cheesecake with my friends and at the end we divided the total and we all owed $8.60 and we all payed and our waiter stole 10 dollars from the check and pretended like we owed more when we didn't so we payed $8.60 more and a tip, i wouldn't recommend going to a stealing restaurant there food ain't worth getting stole off of I'm never returning"}
{"text":"I found the breakfast very good,huge serving,as usual and the service was tight. Im trying to find a go to place for breakfast and so far this place is it. Hard to find your favorites when you hit a new city...but I like the fact that I didn't have to wait and there were no screaming babies or obnoxious customers. Overall very pleasant and satisfying."}
{"text":"While on a business trip, we decided to order from here.  We ordered through the facility we were at and they handled calling in and getting our orders.

I got the Chicken Madeira.  This dish consists of pounded chicken breast with some light breading and cheese melted on top with a few stick of asparagus.  The side is a chunky mashed potato dish.

Since we didn't eat there, the food got to us a bit cold.  The dish was good though.  The portion was huge.  There were two chicken breasts and I only managed to eat one and half of the mashed potatoes.  Could get a bit overwhelming with all the oil from the cheese.

It's Cheesecake Factory.  It's a chain.  Can't expect some fine dining."}
{"text":"Very nice, but eerily gaudy and quiet. My most recent meal (\"Evelyn's Favorite Pasta\") was a bad choice, the pasta was undercooked and the combination was bland, I desperately wanted some tomato sauce or something. But it's Cheesecake Factory, the special favorite of many. Overall all the food is generally good, as is, of course, the cheesecake. Don't come without buying cheesecake, even if you don't have room for it; take a slice home with you. But to my original surprise the first time I came to one of these, Cheesecake Factory is about a dining experience with a very full menu of fine meals."}
{"text":"The menu is so large one immediately begins to wonder if they can do anything well.   Jack of all trades, master of none.  However, as far as chains go, and I lump them in with places like Red Lobster, Olive Garden, etc. I have to say they do decent job.  I had the stuffed mushrooms to start, they were covered in a cheese sauce that didn't need to be there.  My dinner was a piece of overcooked salmon, that I am still not really convinced that it was actually salmon.  The portions are huge, which seems to delight the typical Pittsburgher for some reason, though not me.  The wait staff was attentive, though I the wait for bar drinks took some time.  I didn't try the cheesecake but from what I hear it is good.  We had a table of 13, and didn't take reservations  which is a little frustrating."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back to the Cheesecake Factory. Maybe it's the atmosphere, the lighting, the service or the 9 hour wait, but something always keeps me craving it. 

The food here, as has been my experience at most other Cheesecake Factory locations, is right around mediocre. I can't quite put my finger on it; it's pretty good, never bad or not fresh, but it almost ALWAYS has me running home right after to take care of some, er, business. I heard once that they don't change their cooking oil very frequently. Whatever it is, it always gets my stomach, and the same holds true for everyone I go with. We actually coined a name for it, you usually get the \"6 o'clock sweats\" - you go to bed okay but then wake up around 5 or 6 am with your stomach turning. 

The service at this location was great and we dined outside, which was nice (large seating area out there). Skip the sangria and stick with the martinis or margaritas, or just plain beer or wine."}

This place was incredible. Met by a friendly staff, quick, polite. Place was beautifully decorated and was playing awesome music. Our waitress was awesome. Very funny and on top of everything. We had the avocado rolls, it comes with a sweet and sour kind of sauce, was really good. Also the Shepard's pie ( to die for, srsly), and the fettuccine Alfredo. This location is the best cheesecake factory experience I had at one of those. If you are in LV i would recommend dropping by."}
{"text":"We drove 45 minutes just so We could take advantage of the half price cheesecake!! After an hour wait we got our table. Please reconsider having to \"dine in\" for this offer. It sucks to have to wait so long when you know 75% of the people waiting only came for dessert I'm personally working on trying every flavor they sell!  Went for the banana this time. It was better than I thought. Tasted like a banana cream pie in cheesecake form. No military discount at the Cheesecake Factory, but we will continue to ask anyways!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. This location food and service is better than the others. My significant other is in a big power wheelchair . They are very accommodating as we take up lots of space and need special space of seating."}
{"text":"I was a 1st timer here at Cheesecake Factory... Boy was i glad we made decision to come here. 15 min wait not a big deal I'm sure it's been longer. When seated waitress very polite i don't remember her name though. Takes drink orders & was on top of our refills for the sodas. Also i guess we get complimentary bread which was delicious. Now appetizers i ordered the macNcheese balls in marinara which was excellent. My bro had taquitos which he said were hot lol... Main course bro had chicken parm sandwich looked big came with fries. He said was good. I had meatloaf came with garlic glazed corn or something mashed potatoes & mushroom gravy All delicious!!! Definitely will be back for more. Was too full next time will try dessert."}
{"text":"For a large chain restaurant, this place is worth visiting.  Their menu is ginormous, so variety is not an issue.  The Buffalo Blasts were very tasty, as was the Ahi Carpaccio.  I would skip the crunchy crab balls, they had very little flavor.  My wife enjoyed chicken nachos, while my son and I had Steak Diane and Scampi.  The sauce on the Diane is very good, but the scampi is a bit too sweet.  Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory 3 times. The wait time is always between 30 to 50 min no matter if it is the week or weekend, middle of the afternoon or evening. The food is good but so expensive for what it is! Today i ordered skinnylicious pasta which costed $16, you should have seen the amount of pasta I got, it was ridiculous. 4 bites and it was gone and the worse part is that I ordered mushroom with it and they charged me $4 for it! What the heck!! I like the atmosphere, food is good but the price is not worth the food. Service is ok ... I will not go back to this place!"}
{"text":"I knew what I was getting into when I came here.  Cheesecake Factory food is just not good.  However, this one is a little worse than the others.

I won't even talk about the food because chains are chains, the food here is no different from the others.

The service here is awful!  I tried something new, didn't like it, ate two bites, and it was promptly taken away by the waitress.  Did she ask if everything was alright?  No.  Did she ask if she could bring out something else?  No.  Did she take it off the bill?  No.  I just assumed that was Cheesecake Factory policy, as I had never experienced only eating a couple bites of a dish here before.  What bothered me was how rude she was about everything and how slow it took her to bring out the dessert menu after we asked for it (even though I've memorized the cheesecake offerings, I still need to look at them to pick one out).

For dessert we had the new special cheesecake, pistachio with chocolate waves.  Blah."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friday night dinner rush packed and we barely waited twenty minutes for a table. The host staff was a well oiled machine. 

Pot stickers as usual for an app and jen order the Ahi Tuna Roll. Be forewarned its fried so the meat is cooked. It's was ok. 

Can't not order my chicken Madeira and luckily enough they have a combo with it so I could also try the Steak Diane. I'm temporarily against trying new food items after a bad bad experience at one of my favorite places to eat when I tried something new. Jen ordered a combo too with the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon. Diane was a little so bland for me but I ate some and Jen's cat will be in heaven with the rest. The chicken barely hit the table and it was gone. Yummy!  Jen said hers was good. Her salmon was a little overcooked but that she would get it again because the lemon sauce was really really good. 

I am full so it's going to be blueberry cheesecake to go. I want to finish by saying our server was awesome. Timing was perfect for delivery on food and drinks, and thus the five stars. Customer service can make or break a business regardless of the product or cost. Regardless of the business you are in, this is a universal truth. Her name was Natalie P."}
{"text":"What a shame-after waiting two hours for our meal we were told just another 10 minutes, new manager in pink shirt is ignorant, we walked out"}
{"text":"Gosh the Miso Salmon is Extremely great!!! Don't forget about the Extreme Oreo Cheesecake too!!! Totally had a great time here."}
{"text":"I visited early on a Sunday morning and the wait was not bad at all. I was there around 10:15 AM and the wait was about 20 minutes.

They serve brunch from 10:00AM to 2:00PM as well as their cheesecakes. 

We tried the Mango Key Lime cheesecake it was delicious. The cake was soft and moist and had lots of flavour. The mango complemented the key lime well. It did get a bit sweet towards the end though.

The Tiramisu cheesecake was also great. Same texture as the Mango Key Lime but had a much better balance of bitter and sweet. Also didn't get too sweet towards the end.

Service was friendly and overall was a decent experience. Would go back for an actual meal."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the variety of food makes a great place for family and friends. I highly recommend it as the service is fast and accommodating"}
{"text":"Chris outrageous cheesecake was so good!! Other than that i thought it was alright. 

p.s. service could have been better."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time we go our meal is perfect.the portions are huge and you cannot go wrong with any of their cheesecake options! Hard to find a fav but tuxedo is up there.the service is always great! I cant go here enough and we go every time we have a chance."}
{"text":"I have never liked the food at CC Factory but mostly the consistent bad service. Today just solidified it for me. We call ahead day before a large group, no reservations.  We show up and a two hour wait and we can't even sit together.  Forget that. We left for Cantina 1511 and they hooked us up!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch.  The salmon with pesto, roasted green beans and artichoke was delicious.  The service and atmosphere were great.  Definitely someplace to come back again."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly not good. Upon arrival, I went to take my daughter to the restroom, but there was only one stall available for use. The other two toilets were clogged. Ok. No big deal I guess. Get to our table the serour drink the menus are dirty; full of butter and food debris. But our server Brea is friendly and we're both restaurant managers, but we just got off so we're not doing that right now if you know what I mean. So, we order our drinks and the kids items as they are 1 and 3; its always easier to get them going. If you're a parent you understand. Once they eat, there's a small window where they are content to allow you to eat for a few minutes in peace. Well their food came out; they ate. Some time passed; they were getting antsy. Just as my husband and I are finally about to verbalize to each other the amount of time that we had waited, a man dressed in all black approached the table to regretfully inform us that they were out out an entree we'd ordered. We ordered something else. Remember that window I mentioned before? It came. And it went a long time ago. But we waited another 15 minutes. Here's where Brea fails. She sneaks up to the table and grabs our glasses and refills them ninja fast without making eye contact giving us a chance to ask about our order nor does she bother to communicate; something, anything. Op but here comes our food so forget it who cares. Oh wait, what? Taquitos and what? Oh, no wrong table. Sorry, that's not us but hey now let me just go ahead and speak to your manager. So, another 5 minutes goes by and now we just want any employee to come by so we can get the check for our drinks and kids meals. But not one employee passed by or even looked at our table until of course here comes our food and low and behold, guess what? \"Just kidding, I guess we had the chicken teriyaki afterall. So I just brought it all but I wont charge you for it.\" So we waited for 55 minutes. The manager visited finally. He apologized, and didn't charge us for the items that they were out of,  but not out of, that we had to wait 55 minutes for. Yay us! We would have much rathered paid full price and not have waited. And then we look like asshole parents who let our kids do whatever they want; completely disrupting other guests. We had everything boxed up, paid the bill, and left.. communication is everything. Instead they tried to ignore it and they train-wrecked. We are super easy going; especially being in the business. This experience came down to training and communication or the lack thereof. Anyways we will return, just not this particular location."}
{"text":"Cheesecake is to die for! Menu is outstanding. The only reason I couldn't go with a 5/5 is the price. It's a fantastic menu and great service, but the price is still a little too high for what you are getting."}
{"text":"So, Andrea and I decided to head to Cheesecake Factory for my birthday celebration on Friday night.  I've always loved Cheesecake factory for a lot of reasons, and have yet to find a reason to NOT love it here.  They have such a great menu selection, the decor is always nice, and I love how theres tons of space to dine, socialize and hang out.

Anyways, I got there first so we could get a seat.  It was busy, but thats not a surprise since it was a Friday night.  The girls at the counter were nice and friendly, and told me the wait was only going to be about 15 minutes.  (not bad!)  They gave me a buzzer and I waited in the lobby area for Andrea.

Anyways, I was seating rather quickly, which was nice!  Our server was friendly and cool, and immediately asked what we would like to drink. I got some water, and Andrea got some Iced Tea.

We studied the menu for  a minute, and I ended up getting the shepards pie.  I could really have almost any one of thier dinners here, and find that I will like what they serve me regardless.  I love the variety!  

Anyways, I was happy becuase I felt like our server was available, and even tho it was busy, she didnt make me feel like that, and that was awesome!

Anyways, I still love this place and its just awesome.  Great place to bring anyone! Parents, dates, friends, whatever.   I really don't think you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory, and cannot say enough good things about them!  I've never been to this specific location before, but have been to a few others in the valley, and I love it every single time I go.  Weather its for lunch or dinner, with family, friends or coworkers, this place hits the spot every single time.

Their menu is huge, and awesome!  TONS of great food to choose from. Dinners, lunches, and it all tastes so good!  MMM.  Lunch specials, dinners, deserts you can find everything on their huge menu.  The restaurant is quite large as well so seating is plentiful.  

Today I went with my coworker during lunch, and we both walked out so full!  We got pasta lunch specials, and it was Delicious.  We were seated within a few minutes of entering, and our waitress greeted us and took our order.  She brought out bread which was hot and tasty, which we devoured.  Drinks were always filled, and we were in and out in a little more then an hour.  I got the spagetti with meat sauce, and the lunch sized one was HUGE.  I will be having leftovers for dinner, trust me!

I will be returning here in the future, trust me.  Menu and food is amazing, love the atmosphere, etc.  

I will say, on a side note the parking here has gotten WORSE over past few years.  I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of \"15 minute to go\" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's \"free\" parking but they shove you way in the back on the \"north\" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall.

My advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts...

Anyways, I love you cheesecake factory and you have never failed me! MUAH!"}
{"text":"Let me start off saying that the parking situation at this location sucks! For the amount of people that come here, they need to add more parking. I had to park all the way in the back on a Saturday afternoon. Once I got inside, there were at least 20 people waiting to be seated and the place looked like every available table was taken up. How I love The Cheesecake Factory, but the wait line is always so long!!!

Once I was seated I had to wait for about 10 minutes before my waitress came around to even take my drink order. I knew she was very busy, so I just ordered a water. Once she came back with my drink and brought me some bread, she took off again to tend to more tables. After about another 10 minutes she came back and took my food order. I got the Fettuccine Alfredo. Delicious, but cost $17 which to me wasn't worth it as it was just basic and nothing special about it. I could have made it at home for way less. 

Other than the food, my experience wasn't the best. The place was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. There were screaming kids, pots and pans banging around in the kitchen and just your average noise of people talking in a crowded space. The staff were slow at coming to tables and checking up on people and for some reason, when I was getting ready to leave, there were 5 tables beside me that were empty and tons of people waiting to be seated! Come on, fill those tables up!!"}
{"text":"Only giving 3 stars because the waitress was so nice & my mojito was good. I don't come here often but when I do, I usually order the Cajun chicken pasta which has a thick spicy cream sauce, veggies & is topped with tortilla strips that add really nice texture to the dish. (I order it without chicken). The waitress brought it to the table & asked me to stir it & make sure there was no chicken, which I thought was really considerate because a lot of times people forget to not add meat to dishes. It looked fine (We sat outside & it was dark) but after she left I began to eat & the sauce was so thin & there was barely any of it in the pasta, so it was pretty flavorless. I was really disappointed in the execution. It's always been really consistent in the past. I'm sure I'll be back again & will order that dish again, but I'll make sure to ask them to ensure the sauce is creamy, as it should be."}
{"text":"The four stars is because the waiter was AMAZING! My back was in a LOT of pain and not only did he bring a bag of ice, he even recommended the best alcoholic drinks to get rid of it.  Multiple times he came by our table while we were talking about mildly inappropriate things and he was funny and adorable.  The food is still just Cheesecake Factory, but the Georgia Peach drink was delicious."}
{"text":"First, the downsides, and there are not many: the crowds and the wait: no reservations, no phone-ahead seating, no No-Wait app.  Be prepared to wait for a long time on a weekend night.  I understand the wait can be two hours, a lengthy of time I would never wait for a table anywhere.  My wife and I planned an early dinner, able to be seated within ten minutes of our Friday 6:00 p. m. arrival. By the time we left at a quarter to eight, the place was mobbed despite the bitter cold weather. 

Some of the tables for two are very close to each other.  Hold out for a table or booth in the main room which looks out onto the street and which offers a view.

The restaurant is attractive, distinctive, and comfortable.  The seating in the main room is marvelous, nicely spaced.

The bill can escalate quickly, but if one is going to spend $100 on a grand night out, this is the place to do it. 

The banquet my wife and I enjoyed included: a draft Samuel Adams seasonal brew, a glass of house wine, a large kale and quinoa salad, a delicious, good-sized appetizer consisting of zucchini fries, portobello mushrooms, and avocado, a large fish sandwich with cole slaw and onion rings, and a great burger with mushrooms, cheeses, and onions on a fresh sesame seed bun, one slice of cheesecake with strawberries, one slice of tiramisu cheesecake, and two types of bread (our favorite is the dark, seeded variety).  I know of no restaurant with as many choices of perfectly prepared foods than The Cheesecake Factory.  If you have difficulty deciding what to order, you will be confounded by page after page of the extensive menu.

Teamwork service ensures that the diner is well taken care of and our primary server, Grace, was sweet, friendly, attentive, and delightful.

Our trip to the restaurant was longer than a half hour and it was worth going out of the way to enjoy.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"The worse Cheesecake factory among the rest.
This Las Vegas branch at the Forum is rock bottom lousy.

It seem the management and kitchen team failed to know how to run business when it got busy!!
Foods came in badly done!! 
The team and management were incompetent to run a busy business during busy lunch hour!!

I saw many guests were complaining about their order because the servers were removing their foods and bringing a new orders.

The unfriendly manager was fed up that he had to visit all these \"complain tables\""}
{"text":"Although this is a chain, I felt the staff went above and beyond to get it right. Food was fresh and delicious and the staff cared about service. My modified salad tasted great and appreciate they made the effort to work with me. Avocado egg rolls were the family favourite."}
{"text":"I would never rate any Cheesecake Factory under five stars and this one, being a bit smaller than any other that I've visited, stood up to the five stars. The wait was under 10 minutes around 6pm on a Saturday. I had the avocado egg rolls for the first time and just like everyone else says on yelp, they're awesome."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory is one of the best to go to. 

Walk in and have a great time. The hostes is nice and friendly. The wait is never long and if its to long for you you can just wait at the bar and have a drink :P

The food .. well its going to knock your socks off. really its up to you on how far they go off .

Anytime you go get some cake on the way out. you will love to have it for a little late night snack at the house"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger Medium Rare and my boyfriend ordered his cooked Medium - I said I didn't really want it too rare and the waitress joked that there probably wouldn't be much difference between the two. Well, there was a big difference because my burger came back raw in the middle. Raw. I wish I had taken a picture before sending it back as I'm sitting in the restaurant at this very second writing this review. All we got was a sarcastic apology from the Manager. Never eating at a Cheesecake Factory again."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location in a long time and ended up wondering why  I don't come here more often. Probably the calories but the food was really good! I had the buffalo chicken strips and ordered a side of mashed potatos. Made my own meal! My daughter had the louisianna chicken pasta and it was really good. I love their white chocolate raspberry swirl cheesecake. They also have the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had and they do sell it to go. I usually pick one up once in a while and use it on salads and veggies. They do have a new \"skinny\" menu with reduced calorie items but it is just so hard to pass up the other really good menu items! The menu can be a little overwhelming but is well organized once you figure it out!"}
{"text":"Our experience was sufficient, service was as good as can be expected, but I'm just not into the hype. The place is always on a wait, and yes the cheesecake is awesome, but the menu is just way over the top. I think I counted 23 pages of options, way too much. I wish I had calorie checked before ordering, as the pasta was in excess of 1800 calories... yes, I know, why would someone paying attention to calorie intake also order the 2400 calorie S'mores Cheesecake slice? Well... I did, and yes, it was good. The overall experience, costs, wait and environment warrants nothing more than a three-star rating for me, if my wife had an account her review might say otherwise."}
{"text":"Service and food always great. Dessert fantastic as usual. Prices a little high, they keep going up! Lousianna chicken pasta the best and they have a lunch size that is perfect for lunch and reduced cost."}
{"text":"Great staff. Consistent Cheesecake Factory food. It's our \"go to\" spot when we are unsure what to eat. Something for everybody!"}
{"text":"I got a Mac and cheese burger it was really good. For dessert in got a strawberry cheesecake and Oreo Cheesecake both were really good. Also the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Had a server named Justin. Made our experience so good. Was talkative and friendly, gave great recommendations for food and sweets and was over all just fantastic service and great food. 10/10 would go again so long as we get Justin as our server again.
Update!!: went again had Justin once more! Just as great."}
{"text":"I dined at this establishment located in the Superstition Springs Mall (with access from the parking lot) with six other family members yesterday. This location looks very nice, both inside and out. It was very loud since it was so crowded (there was a short wait at 5:00pm on a Sat) and dimly lit. I thought the lighting wasn't enough but I know they have marketing information that probably tells them people sit/stay longer and spend more $ when there is \"warm lighting\".

I ordered the fish and chips and was very disappointed! It was $17.95 and the pieces of fish that were served were very small and too heavily breaded. One of my daughters liked her meal (some type of pasta) but the daughter that ordered the fried shrimp entree didn't like her meal either. She said the coating on the shrimp coupled with the large size of the pieces made it taste different than other fried shrimp she's had at other restaurants. The wife had grilled salmon and liked it, my aunt had a Cajun type pasta and she liked hers as well. My son had the bacon  burger and liked it (hard to mess up a burger). Several of us had different types of cheesecake and we liked the cheesecake a lot! Our service was very good. 

I like The Cheesecake Factory enough that I would come back but I would definitely not order anything fried in the future. For the five people I paid for (4 of which had cheesecake), it cost me $158! (including 23% tip)! For that kind of money EVERYTHING should have been superb and in this visit it was not!"}
{"text":"Godiva Chocolate cake. Nuff sed. I eat here a lot and every single time, I MUST HAVE the cake!"}
{"text":"Where to start!!!! Everything was amazing from the atmosphere to the cheesecakes to drink time at the bar.  Such a splendid place the food was great. I came here for a family reunion and after church Sunday I suggested the cheesecake factory. Everyone in the group was happy about their order;the spaghetti wonderful we started with a whole thing of appetizers the crab cake appetizer great; the bang bang shrimp oh my gosh! Bistro shrimp amazing grilled pork chop with mashed potatoes and asparagus; outstanding, fried shrimp and just everything!!!! Take a look at the pictures"}
{"text":"+ 1/2 star for the good service. Not quite 4 stars. Food quality seems to be consistent no matter which Cheesecake Factory I go to. I've been to this particular location about 3 times already. I tend to always order the same things - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, Mojito, and Low Carb Cheesecake. It's just right and I don't feel like crap afterwards. This time around, I order the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It was ok, but I wish there was more shrimp and chicken - it seemed to be dominated by the tomatoes and pasta. The wife had her usual - the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Dessert was a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Veruka said she was going to share it with me, however, she is one of the few women in the world that doesn't like chocolate. She had one bite and quit. I ended up eating the whole thing myself. Well, It looks like I'm gonna have to do a juice fast this week - this meal will put at least 5 pounds on me! Service this time around was good - the server was attentive and brought us everything in a timely manner. 3 times a year at the Cheesecake Factory is more than enough for me."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has great food. I had the chicken and biscuits and it was fabulous! Not to mention their wonderful cheesecakes! It has a great atmosphere and the service is rather good, too. On most weekend, the wait for a table at dinner can be long, but since it's in the mall there is much you can do while waiting."}
{"text":"It was such a great surprise to see we have The Cheesecake Factory not too far from home in Surprise, Az. Great ambiance, with hardly a wait! The food is just as I remembered it from when I was a patron in Thousand Oaks, Ca. Always great food. This visit we had the pleasure to be waited on by Brenda. Thank you Brenda for helping us choose the right menu items, and your terrific service! We look forward to visiting again soon. My wish list would be for The Cheesecake Factory to open in Surprise, Arizona! We sure could use a quality restaurant like The Cheesecake Factory in our town."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Just come see for yourself. My husband and I just discovered their brunch and come every other Sunday after church. Never a long wait."}
{"text":"Beet salad=small, bread=free, pastas=too oily, philly cheese steak sandwich=awesome (jeffs meal) and YEA here is why such a poor review. $8 a beer. really why?"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try Cheesecake Factory here in Toronto!!!  Verdict......it is just as good as the States.  I was worried bc many chains that come to Canada from the States have different quality and food standards.  Their menu, their portion and the taste is excellent!  Just be aware the portion sizes are HUGE.  The cheesecakes are amazing!  And if you do not want to wait 2 hours still go and grab a take out cheesecake.  The line up for that is shorter.  If they keep this up there will always be line ups.  I just hope the service and the quality of food stays the same and not taper off.  Just wish the line up was not 2 hours."}
{"text":"They have a really great happy hour I hate that it's only 4-6 most places are 3-7 but the food is very good and the drinks are cheap I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"My husband doesn't like chain restaurants so to get him to try Cheesecake Factory, I had to lure him in under the premise of Happy Hour. Happy to say, the staff at this CF did not disappoint! Fast, friendly service- awesome happy hour pups and great cocktails. $5 each? Wow. I have found something to like about visiting the Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a party of 5.  We got a nice round booth.  The calamari appetizer was tasty, and the dinners were excellent.  I had a spicy chicken and shrimp pasta dish that was really good, and took half home with me.  The Godiva chocolate cheesecake was excellent, although we were expecting a larger slice.  The menu is extensive with something for everyone."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my more \"high end\" dining out choices.  I know I can count on a special experience here when I take friends or family out for a special occasion.  The menu selections are endless !"}
{"text":"Always a 5 star experience no matter which one we go to.

On a Friday night before Christmas it was a bit busy and we did have to wait over an hour which is longer then usual. 

The server was very friendly and helpful for our large party.  The menu is huge but everything I order I end up loving.  THe fish and chips were so crispy and juicy! Th fish tacos had so much flavor.

I try a new cheesecake every time and this time it was the Hershey Chocolate one. Wow! A mouthful of chocolate in all its forms and cheesecake! I was in heaven!"}
{"text":"I went with my sister for lunch on a Saturday.  We got there about 10 minutes after they opened so we didn't have the wait other people have complianed about.  They seated us at a two top bench seat in the bar area. At first this seemed fine but 10  minutes later the hostess started setting up the table next to us (the tables were about 12 inches apart) with 2 highchairs and a booster seat then seated 2 couples with 3 small children. They were not happy being squeezed into a bench seat with the highchairs etc. but even after they complained to the waitress and the hostess, the hostess seemed unable to come up with a solution.  Seems they could have just moved them to a table where they could move the chairs to accomodate the highchairs.  The menu is overwhelming.  I'm always a little suspicious of a menu with so many items.  I feel like more often than not, everything just ends up being okay and nothing is really good.  My sister ended up getting the burrito and I got the bbq chicken salad.  The burrito was the biggest portion of food I've ever seen in a restaurant.  It could have easily fed 4 adults.  I could only eat about 1/3 of the salad and it was the lunch portion.  The food was good, not great.  The service was good.  I would go again but would request a table, not a bench seat."}
{"text":"Always have good selection of high quality food, friendly service, & awesome cheesecake.  Best place on earth to eat cheesecake, only problem is deciding which one to have out of 50+ flavors.  They have even gone the extra mile to cater to my vegan friends and if a problem arises they definitely try to make things right. Conveniently at the Chandler Fashion Center. =)"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent menu choices.  Miso salmon is the best tasting salmon dish I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful-meatloaf mashed potatos and the best bread ever...Jeremy was our server and he was FANTASTIC~"}
{"text":"We went to the Chandler location for my daughter's birthday dinner. We were told it would about a 45 minute wait. We waited an hour and 20 minutes. The hostess rolled her eyes when we asked how much longer after an hour. She made it clear we were bothering her.
We always loved this chain where we used to live and we were craving some of our favorite dishes. The server was great and the food was the same but, the experience was not very positive. The server did his best to make up for the wait and hostess and we were grateful. Just don't think we will be frequenting this location."}
{"text":"I have been to a Cheesecake Factory in Dallas but I have never gotten a pizza there . I have to say it was very good and cheesy . The cheesecake had a Nutella drizzle and a hazelnut crunch it tasted like a Ferro Roshea ."}
{"text":"This place rocked. They had everything imaginable on the menu, cool atmosphere and more of the more affordable nice places out in Vegas. Really good service too and very clean."}
{"text":"I was there with my wife on the 1st of January 2015. we were seated quickly. After seating we waited for 15 minutes before my wife went to the desk and informed the Manager that we had not seen a server, it was another 5 minutes before an Asst. Manager came by and asked if she could help. When our server appeared she looked angry and slapped the ticket folder on the table and begrudgingly asked us what we wanted. We were not visited by a Manager for the rest of our visit although a table behind us was for as similar problem with the same server.
  After leaving my wife called the restaurant and spoke with a Manager who proceeded to give a raft of excuses for the very poor service and disgruntled demeanor of the server. Not once were we offered even an extra piece of bread for our trouble. I dine out very frequently and we were owners of our own small chain of restaurants for 30 years. We know the business and will excuse almost anything if our issues are properly resolved. The Manager who responded was not skilled in customer service nor was he much interested in our issues. I wonder if this is a pervasive attitude in company culture or just a one off issue. Needless to say we will think twice before returning."}
{"text":"I use to really enjoy coming here due to the variety of food on the menu. It's never really been amazing but there's a ton of choices and the cheesecake is amazing. The last time I came here I ordered a piece of banana cheesecake. It tasted slightly off but still good so I assumed it was just me and ate a few bites of it. Later that night I was up and sick from the bad cheesecake I consumed earlier. After that experience I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying i am pregnant & can eat very limited things. My pregnancy by far has been hard due to the fact that my baby does not like much food. So when i have to order from different restaurants every day due to an actual craving, i expect to get what i pay for & ordered. I ordered a cuban sandwich specifically bc there are pickles in it. I go pick up my order, drive all the way back home bc i am not down the street, to find not only did they put no pickles but also didn't put mustard. This doesn't taste like a cuban sandwich at all now, it tastes like a panini from panera bread, plain."}
{"text":"Service here isn't bad. The food is pretty decent. We decided done here bcz we couldn't make up or minds. This is what we finally agreed on. It's late. We're all hungry. The food here is generally consistent. We dine here bcz it's a familiar restaurant chain. 
Don't ask me for a particular dish. I always order different."}
{"text":"In my opnion, this place is one of the nicest and fanciest chain restaurants in all of the land.  Yes, their prices may be high, and I absolutely agree with Joe that the nutrition of their items are outrageous, but where you want to go somewhere to splurge, this is a pretty good place to do it.  

The menu is almost overwhelming, and they keep adding more and more items to it.  Actually they did recently just come out with a skinnylicious menu, so that might answer some negative complaints about their portions and nutrition. 

By the way, did we even talk about the cheesecake?  Yes, it is amazing, and yes, they do have an assortment that will keep you wondering which one you want to choose."}
{"text":"Brenda took great care of us.  The menu is daunting but get yourself a glass of wine and a grilled artichoke and peruse until you hit your target.  Even after several years of high traffic, the place is still clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken madera tonight with  fried zucchini. Plenty to split between my wife and I. Good service, nothing great.  A bit of a wait at this location. Great options and good pricing if u plan to share, otherwise portions are to big and to much."}
{"text":"This was the worst customer service that I have experienced. Every waiter was rude to us and gave us attitude. They made it very obvious to make us feel like we didn't have money. Just to add this in our first server had told us he was going home for the night so he was being relieved by our second server but he continued to serve the table right next to us throughout our entire time spent there. Now to our second server who would come and bring us our food and or drink; she would slide/slam the plate or glass right onto the table without warning and would walk away without saying a thing. She did not ask us any follow up questions. She gave us attitude throughout the whole dinner up until it was dessert time which is around the time the check comes so that was when she decided she would be \"nice.\" Just to top it off she packed my food and then dropped some of my food on the ground and of course did not apologize. Honestly after all that I still tipped which I regret because she didn't deserve it and I wish I spent my money elsewhere. Not everyone has a million dollars but every customer is a customer and should be treated equally with respect it's a shame the servers here know nothing about that."}
{"text":"Always a great meal here. One of the only places where I have 4 or 5 favorites depending on what I am in the mood for. 
I love the Chicken Madeira and Chicken Bellagio. The Crab Rangoon appetizer is really good too. They make a nice guacamole as well. Cocktails really good and consistent. 
We get the Cobb Salad tossed with Caesar dressing, yummy. 
Extensive menu with something for everybody."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember haha It's huge with a \"patio\" area and 2 floors~ Inside is very beautiful too I hate how the restrooms are located upstairs though.. The wait can be long at times so we only come at odd times now.. I know people tend to hate on chain restaurants but I think CF is one of the better ones.. Their portions are huge and the food is tasty. 

Must Haves:
-Chicken Madeira: Everyone's favorite. Its just 2 chicken breasts with madeira sauce, cheese, mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.. If I'm trying to watch what I eat I substitute the mashed potatoes for broccoli.. 
-Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: It is not too overly spicy and has just the right amount of kick.
-Chicken Lettuce Wraps: If I want something healthy-ish that's not a salad I get this dish.. It's huge so it will fill you up.. They even have noodles as one of the toppings.
-Carlton Salad: It's tasty and fresh but the dressing has a very strong sesame oil taste so you may want to ask for the dressing on the side or another dressing.
-Bread: Love their bread.. Especially the sweet brown one mmmmm haha
-Strawberry lemonade: Sugar rimmed glass.. perfect for a hot Vegas day 

Service is always friendly and it's a fun place to people watch after or before you shop at Forums~ 

HOT TIP: If you decide to get a salad you can swap out lettuce for mixed field greens free of charge.. yummmm ;]]]"}
{"text":"As always delicious food!!! I love that there is a skinnylicious menu for those of us that are health conscious!!! Great service too. I ordered the salmon which melts in your mouth and yummy grilled veggies to go with it."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory was at the district in Henderson. The food was great, the service was even better. Our waiter (didn't catch his name, but he had a distinct handlebar mustache), mentioned the daily specials and was very accommodating to our customized orders. 

We didn't wait too long to be seated, and our food came out pretty fast too. 

We've eaten at many cheesecake factories before, but what made this review and experience so yelp worthy, was our fantastic waiter."}
{"text":"Service was great! I loved how she kept refilling my water and having conversations with us. The food was great too!!"}
{"text":"If you like The Cheesecake Factory then the one in Scottsdale, AZ won't disappoint.  Consistency in a chain is always good especially when you are traveling and not sure what you might get.  This location had very friendly hosts and servers.  The food was standard Cheesecake Factory.  The hostess even called the hotel shuttle for us, a very nice courtesy."}
{"text":"Experience was always great. Ordered a Merlot to start off taste was a bit off but still a great glass of wine. Then whole wheat bread was always my favourite. Roast corn was flavourful with salsa and different herbs but I think they didn't pan fry it long enough. Then lastly shrimp scampi was awesome. Even though it's super garlicky and buttery. Almost could finish the whole plate. Overall good tasted great. Just that the server need to work on his service skills a bit more."}
{"text":"I love the cheesecake factory - not even for the cheesecake! Although the cheesecake is great.  I always get this giant chicken thing with Pesto sauce and cheese on spaghetti.  Whatever it is, get it - it is great."}
{"text":"So great to be able to get brunch on Saturday now. Try the waffle with fresh strawberries or the Monte cristo."}
{"text":"Always crowded on the weekend and of course that's when they do not take reservations. Much better for lunch because it's a better price and the portion is closer to what I would like. Every time I go I share the barbecue ranch chicken salad with my friend because it's delicious(even during lunch time we can't finish it). Too expensive, too much food, and too long of a wait."}
{"text":"Fast, accommodating service and food was  great. Our server , Rosa, was delightful and eager to make sure our impromptu birthday dinner for my 10 year old went great. The did a great job accommodating food allergies too."}
{"text":"This review is going to sound a bit harsh.... but I'm sorry, for the prices they are charging, I expect a little more class. 

Yes, the food was good, the waitress was nice and funny, but they both needed a bit of refining. 

To start off with the first thing out of the waitress' mouth was \"I love your hair!\" Then continued on about hair for anorther minute and a half, ending with when hers is wet it's \"like almost touching my butt.\" OKay! Over-share honey! I'm supposed to order food and a drink now that we have discussed your butt? Anyway, finally moving on I ordered a tea and my friend got a water. Her timing for check backs were great, but refilled my tea waaaaaay too much, I would take two sips and then there she was again refilling my glass (and filling the air with unnecessary commentary), not to mention when she refilled my glass she had to pick it up every time and twice she touched the times on my forks. I know it sounds weird, but really bothered me. Another one of my big pet peeves, if you are wanting to remove a plate from the table and I have a utensil still on it, ask me to grab it off or just bring me a new one. DO NOT remove it yourself and place on the table, ick! She also grabbed my butter wrapper off my plate touching my bread. Just leave me a lone lady, stop touching all my s***! I felt like she wanted to pop a squat with us and have girl talk. Back off. 

The food came, it was alright. I started with a side salad and friend for fried artichoke hearts. My salad clearly had been pre made and sitting in a cooler for hours, as the lettuce was brown and over dressed. The artichokes were good and the dipping sauce it came with was yummy. Everything else that hit the table was great. PS: Vanilla bean cheese cake is awesome! 

Over all we had a good time. But for my meal costing me $30 and I didn't even have a cocktail, home girl needs to learn some cooth and manners serving a table."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory is fairly new, and the food is just as great as the one in Henderson.  The service was equally great, with friendly staff and servers checking to make sure our needs were met.  We will be having our office Christmas party at this location in a few weeks...can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Service accuracy is awful. Side salads are not delivered before your entree.  Our server forgot to put our order in - so our group of 8 was fed one person at a time. We won't be back! No cheesecake can make up for poor server performance! Stay away. If you want Cheesecake Factory, visit another location!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed walking in the door is the grand size of the restaurant. Towering ceilings, walls  filled with large decorations,  colorful glass lights, and intricately painted open spaces was somewhat busy but pleasing to the eye.

The herb-encrusted salmon salad was delicious. Of course I had to try the 30 year anniversary cheese cake which was wonderful but very large. Desert sizes seem to be made to share with two or more.

The bar looks like a great place for happy hour and hanging out with friends. This is the kind of place you can feel comfortable dressed up or in jeans and a t-shirt.

Overall a great place for a date or meeting friends for a drink or a meal."}
{"text":"The worst Cheesecake Factory location I have ever been to. Food was distasteful. Staff was rude, also, when I first walked inside, it wasn't very busy, however it took about 5 mins for someone to come to the hostess booth to seat us. Bathrooms were filthy. There was poo and period stains on the toilet, a dirty diaper on the floor, no toilet seat covers, no toilet paper, and the pad/tampon trash was full, you can see the bloody applicators. Granted customers left the restroom dirty, but it didn't seem as if they were checking up on the restrooms at all. I was literally trying not to throw up my food while I was in the restroom as I was already gagging in disgust. I didn't even use the restroom. We went here for my friends birthday and I felt as if they thought we were lying about it being his birthday."}
{"text":"Great food and desserts as always. Had thai chicken wrap and avocado egg rolls to start. For dinner my family had garlic pasta with shrimp, bang bang chicken/shrimp and chicken bellagio. All very good and huge portions, so leftovers for lunch tmw. For dessert Carmel cheese cake and tiramisu. Great meal :-)"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is a well oiled, fine tuned machine. They have good food, good service, great ambiance, fun atmosphere, and reasonable prices. 

The first thing you notice about Cheesecake Factory is how enormous and grandeur it is. The colors are beautiful and warm, and even though it is a huge restaurant each table feels tucked away and private. This is a great place for a romantic dinner for two, or for a giant group. There is a bar area with tvs for game watching, and a patio for when it's nice outside, so there's a place for everyone to be happy. 

The staff is wonderful; everyone greets you warmly and seems to love what they do. The servers are extremely attentive, efficient, quick, and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy and get what you want. They know the menu front to back which is quite impressive considering it is about 20 pages long. The most difficult thing about eating at The Cheesecake Factory is figuring out what you want to eat. The menu is HUGE, and offers everything; pastas, steaks, gourmet chicken dishes, seafood, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wings, quesadillas, and even breakfast. You name it, most likely they have it! You would think with such a large menu the food would be mediocre, but on the contrary it is actually delicious. I have never had a bad meal here or been disappointed with a dish. They even bring out warm bread and butter to get you started. If you save room don't forget their cheesecakes, they are exceptional. 

Cheesecake Factory is a great place for a solid meal any time of the day. You'll find something for everyone and you'll go home full, satisfied, and most likely with lots of leftovers!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory before but this was the first time I had a sit down meal at this Toronto location. Apparently the hype has not died down yet, and we still had to wait for 30 minutes for a table even though we did not go at a popular time. We finally sat down and the waitress brought some bread. We had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was dry, and there are much better biscuits out there. The food is also not that cheap.

Much better not to eat a meal here and instead just grab cheesecake to go, because that's always reliable!"}
{"text":"All the reviews on the food are pretty accurate. You know it, it is a chain and has all the normal stuff that taste, well, like most other places.

Something exciting about this place is that it is a really cool place to get desserts for your friends and entertainment. Not just cheesecakes. I haven't bought a cheesecake yet. 

I am talking about LInda's Fudge Cake, the Tiramisu, the Black Out Cake. These are huge cakes, and very, very good. You just need a full day to let them thaw out as they keep them in the freezer.

Very good, very decadent, and very fun to share.  Try it."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory since day one. This was my first visiting this location of The Cheesecake Factory.  I got lucky enough to get a table as The Cheesecake Factory does get busy real fast. 

As I already knew what I wanted to order. For the appetizer I had the Chicken Quesadilla that was excellent. For the main dish I had the BBQ Chicken Salad that was also excellent. 

What I like about The Cheesecake Factory over the larger restaurant chains the food is always solid. The food portions are always large to share with others.

Leave room for desserts. As the cheesecakes are a must. No matter what you are craving when it comes to cheesecakes you will not go wrong. I recommend the mango or raspberry cheesecake. 

The customer service was excellent from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave. This Cheesecake Factory location in the back of the forum shops. You have private lot parking and valet."}
{"text":"This was one of my daughters favorite restaurants for a long time. Unfortunately the wait times AND Slow service started changing that.  The last time we went it was the slowest service ever and we both got sick from the food.  We now avoid all locations unfortunately because every time we see the place we remember how sick we were AND how poor the service was.  Such a shame because at one time it was great!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I have enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory for years. Today however I ordered a simple steak sandwich via Door Dash and received a full out gristle sandwich with huge pieces of almost pure gristle. My cake and salad were pleasant, but I really did not feel like waiting an hour to be fed a garbage sandwich."}
{"text":"I was here only for dessert but i'm really upset to miss dinner. Everything was amazing but i wanted to try their main courses because they looked amazing. Our server Daniel is the one of the best (no doubt!) he took care of my table perfectly. Thanks for everything..."}
{"text":"Today I had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. I had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and it was great. Tasty, spicy and well flavored. We didn't need to wait for a seat and the ambiance was cosy. The big problem where the pictures of mouth watering cheesecakes. Tempting but we skipped. The sandwich alone gave me a full stomach."}
{"text":"I came here a few wks ago on a Saturday afternoon for dinner with some out-of-state guests. I had been saving The cheesecake factory for a special occasion b/c I dont routinely order dessert. 

ENTREE: I ordered the cobb salad which I would never ever order again. Ive had better cobb salads @ Big Dogs! This salad was 95%lettuce with anything else as an afterthought. I coudl count the # of blue cheese crumbles and pieces of what appeard to be walmart deli sliced turkey on my salad. I was not happy..what a waste of $13.00 I'd rather have had wendy's cobb and that isnt very good either.  my bf ordered the chicken Bellagio. OMG 2000 calories but it tasted divine. Basil infused pasta with some sort of lemon ckin on top. Good but Too caloric. 

DESSERT: Yum. OMG.. as my Julio (my love) would say, \"this had wedding cake written all over it!!\" we ordered the Red-Velvet Cheesecake. there. are. no. words. I cannot begin to tell you how utterly delicious and marvelous this dessert was. So decadent and sinful yet not too sweet and not so crazy. LOVED IT. We'd come back just for dessert in the future and since his bday is coming up we just might do that. 

SERVICE: eh.. it was ok. What I never understood is why when you have a table of at least 6 people, odds are it maybe 3 couples especially if you see there are 3 females and 3 males. maybe. so why on earth would you assume in your infinite wisdom and experience servicing the restaurant industry that one person is going to pay the entire tab? We are going to split this up b/c thats what coupes do. and instead of making this awkward for everyone involved. please ask us if we would like to split this up one 1 ticket or 2 or 3? and make this easier for everyone. at the beginning of the meal. this has annoyed me for years with large restaurants such as this. 

end thought: order dessert. go light on food .. split a pizza and go for the dessert!"}
{"text":"It's okay for a chain. The menu is massive. Like lord of the rings trilogy massive as are the portions. My dishes were always decent but I always ended up spending any from 20-30 dollars. 

I ran into some slight problems though when attempting to buy cheesecake for my roommate. I don't eat cheesecake and when I ask the man... hmm I mean apathetic adolescent behind the counter which cheesecake he'd recommend he seemed a little annoyed by my question and without looking at me said he didn't like cheesecake. Fine whatever. Maybe they stashed him behind that particular counter so he wouldn't be tempted to nibble away at the confections. So I deferred to the girl next to him. Apparently she didnt like cheesecake either and had no opinions on the matter. The worker behind her same situation. Thanks for all the help. In the end i made the decision with the help of another patron."}
{"text":"Nice place.. but.. don't expect good stake..  for meat go to stake restaurant.. here the stake is little  and half of the little stake  is just fat... even the manager said that is nothing to do about it.. it is what it is.. well.. nice place but.. don't ask for any meat.."}
{"text":"This is one of my more favorite places to go.  Decent menu selection and I love the Caesar salad dressing.  Tonight however I was less than impressed.  Our server was lacking.   He was not very attentive and slow in some cases chit chatting with some tables when other tables were waiting    Another server in the adjoining section was on spot.   He will get a less than typical tip from me as he said he would bring the check but it's been over 8 mins already and still waiting.  Finally it came. Wonder how long we wait to cash out.  He'll be getting less than 15% now.  Shame, this place usually has good service but maybe that's only when the server is female and can multitask.    Rating is 3 stars cause food was decent but service sub par.  And took 5 more mins for him to come pick up the check.  I was so bothered I brought it to the attention of the hostess to inform management"}
{"text":"Great service from the bar, Steak Diane is amazing, Old Fashion on point and the dessert OMG! Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake is to Die For. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"[Cheesecake Coma]

Who doesn't love an exaggerated size slice of cheesecake? My girls and I stopped by last night around 10ish. It's was pretty empty. The service was delayed the entire visit. We had to continuously ask to order beverages dessert food and the bill. I get it it's late but they're open until midnight and guest should expect the same level of service until the restaurant closes. 

The food and desert quality did not disappoint. Each dish ordered was exceptional and served promptly! 

A few of the many items ordered were Tuna Tartare (so good omg), dynamite shrimp and various desserts!
 $100 later we are satisfied until next time!"}
{"text":"Strictly talking food, this Cheesecake Factory gets four stars. On the weekend, parking is hard to find, but it's a pretty awesome location with other new shops and family activities. The experience though, knocked it a star, otherwise it would have been one of my favorite restaurants we checked out this weekend.

I ordered a Flying Gorilla beverage to start and it was pretty much my favorite part of a very, very late lunch. Still, we all were able to order from the lunch menu. I had the Avocado Rolls to start, followed by the Chinese Chicken Salad. Everything tasted great, though I'm not a huge fan of the thin, white crispy noodles. I should have asked for them to go easy on that, because there was literally a mountain of it (hence no photo). 

Appetizers came out fast, but everything else was weird, honestly. My sister ordered a Piña Colada to start and then a Pepperoni Pizza. I don't think she was a huge fan of the drink, but she said the pizza was pretty much what she hoped for. Even at lunch, the portion was rather large. Leftovers, yo! Only problem is she got her food way before our friend and I. She was almost done by the time I got our food.

Our friend ordered Calamari to start, which I would recommend to everyone, because their Calamari is always so good! Lightly fried, crispy bits of octopus makes for a great appetizer and big enough to share! She ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy that as well.

So what happened to our bread? You know that thing they usually bring out at the very beginning at every Cheesecake Factory? Apparently they were running behind on a lot of our order, which was surprising for a weekend. Tina our server was as helpful as she could be, despite not being able to get everything out at the same time. The bread didn't even come out until we were ready for the check, so that was kind of annoying. 

I would only recommend they staff the kitchen properly on a Saturday, no exceptions. Other than that, I genuinely had a nice time at Cheesecake Factory and am curious to explore more of Summerlin in the future."}
{"text":"I went to have brunch here for Mother's Day. Party of 12. The wait was only about 20 minutes and the staff was friendly. They took my stroller and stored in for me while we ate since the space was a little tight which was nice of them. I ordered the chicken piccata and it was excellent. my wife got the chicken mushroom soup which she loved. they validated my parking. Overall I enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"I'm generally indifferent to the Cheesecake Factory - to me it's basically two star food from a pointlessly long menu, served in ginormous portions in a painfully loud space.

This CF was better than average with really, really good service. We ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps and Summer Rolls and both were fresh and pretty darn tasty.

Cheesecake Factory still isn't my favorite, but this location is much better than most others."}
{"text":"People don't give this place enough credit. Sure its big and the menu is even bigger, filled with a lot of whatever food..but if you go for the right reasons, then its an amazing spot to go. Here are the only reason's to go to The Cheesecake Factory.

1) It's open relatively late, I think after midnight
2) Brown Bread with Butter--out of this world
3) Avacado Egg Rolls--mmmmm
4) Louisiana Chicken Pasta-A lot of food, nice tangy taste

you could easily share this with two people. ask them to split #4 with your guest."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the cheesecake factory. Whenever we want to treat ourselves, we go here. Now there has been an on going problem that we face every time we come here. When it is just the wife and I, they will ALWAYS sit us at the two person, tiny a$$ table. In between two other people.  We make it a point to come when it's slow so we can get better seating. Normally we don't say anything and just sit down, but today we just got tired of it.  We finally asked for a booth, and of course they had open booths to sit us in. 

Besides the seating issues we have every time we go to a cheesecake factory, we love the food and will not stop coming for the food. Unless, the seating issue gets so bad."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant, but my experience today has been awful. The food was horrible and the waitress messed up most of my family's orders. The food was burnt or had something wrong. The wait felt like ages. Don't come here and expect the best."}
{"text":"L)Amazing that I have passed this restaurant ten thousand million time
as its about 2 miles from my home.
Well I was invited to a business lunch on Sat at noon....not a good time or day as this very large restaurant was crowded to the rim. Surprised at the great service. There is something for everyone on their giant menu. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. While is was super sized the quality was not up to pare. The 
Cuban cafe off of the 215 and Eastern has the real deal. The other 5 guests all
enjoyed their fare.
The selections of cheese cakes were amazing and New York quality. My choice of the 2 chocolate Hershey was over the top. 5 stars and 5 million calories.The only downside was that
prices tended to be somewhat higher then other similar fair"}
{"text":"Great meal and nice location.
We ordered the following; Calamari, Thai chicken wraps, Sheila's salad, and we both had the Shepherds Pie. All of the food was on point in flavor.
Very large portions so lots of leftovers for lunch for the next couple days.

A large party of 25 people was seated next to us so service went downhill and no dessert menu was offered. It was my birthday celebration and we couldn't wait anymore as our waiter was busy taking dinner orders so we packed up the leftovers and just left."}
{"text":"The waiters are really busy...
Pasta Da Vinci was veeery tasty
And the cheesecake... yummy!"}
{"text":"Best cheesecake! I had the Sea Salt Carmel cheesecake! Yum! From the time I walked in the door to the time I left; friendly hostess, nice and friendly server, counter people VERY friendly! Lots of suggestions on the best cheesecake to try!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best breakfast option on property. Had a minor issue at the start that was quickly resolved by Tiffany the manager on duty and our server Jessica Cherry who was brilliant and highly alert. 

She provided us with great service and is a model of how an awesome server does their job. Ask for her and you can count on a great experience... And leave a big tip!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing customer care. Server was rude and careless. Asked for more bread and never got it. Water and soft drinks were never topped 
I give them 0% on customer care 
Not a real cheese cake factory restaurant"}
{"text":"Typical CF, the acoustics are bad especially when busy. It's hard to have a conversation. Service was slow, but food was good. New birthday cake cheesecake was awesome!"}
{"text":"Staff could use a little polishing, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"My Husband and I came last night for dinner to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary. We planned this evening out right after Christmas when we received several gift cards from family. 

   The place was pretty busy, but we decided to stay. We were seated promptly which was very nice. We were told that someone would be with us shortly as usual. After 10 minutes and 2 birthday celebrations we were both shocked to find that no one was tending to us. We decided to just wait and see if someone would be coming to our table then. Seems we were seated at a bust time maybe? After 22 minutes I got up and went to the gal that seated us. I let her know that we had been sitting there the whole time with no one to tend to us. Immediately the manager turned around and apologized. Promised to make our evening very nice. As we walked to the table I noticed a server talking to my Husband. We agreed to stay and attempt to enjoy our visit. 

  I know things happen and you can't take it personally. We didn't. I'm glad we stayed because our server and the manager took really good care of us. Our server was very friendly and made us feel better. We respected her and gave her a fair opportunity. We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was brought to our table immediately. It was hot and fresh. The 2 sauces were delicious. We will order it again!

   I had the skinny chicken pasta and Hubby had the chicken di pana. Both dishes were very tasty. We both enjoyed our dishes, but wish we had switched plates at some point. We decided to share a piece of Kahlua cheesecake and take a piece of the lemon meringue cheesecake home. Great idea! 

   Even though our evening started out rough, the service and food was worth it all. Our server and the manager definitely made our evening very enjoyable and fun. We are very thankful for the experience and are planning to return soon. Thank you to everyone for another great experience!"}
{"text":"Yeah this place is good. I came here once after PURE. It was good because when you're witha  crowd of people who usually have some type of after-club attitude, its a good place for them to get whatever they want."}
{"text":"Called for an order for pick up. Ordered buffalo wings no blue cheese with extra ranch, luau salad DRY with extra dressing/sauces on the side (because I know they put additional sauces on the wontons) extra wontons, and Thai lettuce wraps no bean sprouts with extra cucumber. Buffalo wings are super well done/borderline burnt and dry, extra ranch means two small half empty containers of ranch, my luau salad came with sauces on the wonton unlike being dry like I ordered so of course they were soggy by the time we got home, the Thai wraps had 3 shredded/broken lettuce cups which were also drenched in water in the container they were in so they were super wilted... all this for an incredible $50! Money far from being well spent. Super disappointed and I don't know what's happened to cheesecake Factory standards buy they need to get it together."}
{"text":"I know, I know. If you're on vacation, you should try to eat at non-chain restaurants that are unique to the area and not available elsewhere. But I just couldn't resist eating at The Cheesecake Factory! 

We were looking for a place to eat breakfast/lunch on a Saturday morning, and so many of the restaurants were packed and had 45-minute waits. So we walked around the Forum Shops, and there was The Cheesecake Factory, a beacon amid a sea of overpriced stores! We had to go in. And get this: No wait for a table!

We sat upstairs on the second floor. This place is huge, by the way. Plenty of seating. 

Their menu is also huge, so bring your reading glasses. For an appetizer, we ordered the Made-to-Order Guacamole, which was very good and came with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream - all of the necessary condiments to go along with chips!

For an entree, I got the Southwest Chicken Sandwich, which had grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro and chipotle mayo on Toasted French bread. It's also served with jalapenos, but I asked that they don't put them on there, and I'm glad I did because this sandwich definitely had a kick to it. It was really good, though, and I used some of the leftover guacamole from our appetizer on my sandwich, which made it extra good. 

Then, of course, we had to get cheesecake. I got the Carmel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. Amazing! The perfect ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"Whew, garlic.

Been to a CF only twice before--once in Palo Alto, CA, and once in Hollywood.

I thought that the food was okay then, but not so much now.  I'm usually a fan of pasta at most restaurants--even at Denny's it's halfway decent.  The spaghetti sauce here had so much garlic in it that it was literally the only thing that I could taste on the pasta.  If I wanted aioli and noodles, I would have asked for it.  The meatballs were pretty good, but were PACKED with onions.  I now reek of garlic and onions and my wife won't get near me.  Thanks guys.

Her salad was fairly good, but nothing to write home about.  Nice bread.  Service was friendly.  It was entertaining sitting outside and watching the birds fly in after patrons would leave their tables--they would take bread and raid the sugar packets.

Meh.  Not really impressed."}
{"text":"This place is filthy...had sticky cherry or strawberry residue on the table and they lay out your utensils on the dirty table.  The utensils are filthy too.  They have food stuck to them and water spots.  A lady that was seating guests was not in any type of uniform and they picked up the extra utensils on the table that weren't being used and put them back on their drawers.  Gross...not eating here again unless they clean up their act.  The waiter was nice and the food was ok.  That's why I gave this review 3 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews in general but this was just outrageous. This place is straight up pathetic. Me and my bf started lining up at like 6:45 at the mall. Then we got escorted to get our pager at like 8. Which is fine, I get it, still opening week. When we got our pager, the girl that gave our pager said it'll be an hour wait which we waited patiently. However, we got extremely upset when we waited until 9:40 and saw that the girl who was waiting before us was long gone inside and people who were after us got called in before us. And mind you, these people that got in were a party of two as well and after us were more than a party of 4+. My boyfriend got so fed up that he went inside to ask what was going on, they asked for his name and they kept searching on the list, clearly our names was not written down and the fact the host and hostess at the front desk that my boyfriend talked to said this to each other \"is this another case of no name?\" Like are you serious? My boyfriend was frustrated and said that we waited more than an hour and how people before and after us already went in. It was just me and my boyfriend, we shouldn't even been waited this long. Then they had the audacity saying that it wasn't their fault, no apology whatsoever. Then they immediately said we were next don't worry. If my boyfriend didn't went in and asked, we definitely would have not been called whatsoever. The one star is only for the food we ordered and the efficient waitress we had. Other than that, we were so hungry, angry, and exhausted to the point that our mains and the cheesecake didn't even taste like anything. Will we come back? Maybe if we were in the states and have enough time, but definitely not here again."}
{"text":"My first time eating at \"the cheesecake factory\", at our surprise we where greeted professionally by the host. Server quickly made sure our wait time didn't surpass 5 mins. We asked for recommendations on a three course meal.. Tex Mex Egg rolls.. Miso salmon.. Hibachi steak.. White chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheese cake.. Quality, Presentation and Tasteful made the best of it.. We also had a little mix with rice preference but the server quickly made a correction.. That's what you call quality service.."}
{"text":"Never did I actually think going to The Cheesecake Factory would be one of my highlights of my Vegas trip recently for a convention. Not only did we have one of our better nights here, but we actually spent about 4 hours sitting at the bar. No lie. That was our second night in a row there. 

Our first night, we came for dinner and didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a table. We quickly snagged a corner seat at the bar and were helped by Jeremy (The guy that looks like \"the guy from Jarhead\" aka Jake Gyllenhaal). We both ordered the fish tacos, but Jeremy suggested the plate was big and we could probably split it, which we ended up doing and didn't regret it because it was a LOT. The only gripe I would have is that the rice was strange. I have no idea what was in it, but it was strange. He was quick and attentive-- perfect dinner service! 

The next night, we opted going straight to the bar again, and were helped by Jose & William. William, hands down, knows which dishes are worth getting and will steer you away from something you may regret ordering later. HANDS DOWN this guy's got the menu memorized. I even was able to test his knowledge about what was in certain dishes, and he was able to answer without hesitation; and if anyone's ever been in the Cheesecake Factory, you know their menus are 80-page books. He was able to suggest the Miso Salmon & the Veggie Salad, both of which we ordered and were NOT disappointed (seriously, order these items). He can also make a mean \"Jolly Rancher\" shot! Jose was one of my favorite bartenders... basically ever. This guy's been bartending for 8 years, and you can really tell. He has an awesome attitude, a great smile, and is efficient as heck (he also bartends events, so if you're ever looking to find someone to do your event, he's your man!) He can make great conversation, tell some insane stories, but will still finish the hundreds of drink orders that are coming in. I feel like after the 4 hours we spent sitting at the bar, we made some great Cheesecake Factory friends. I wish this particular CF were local, but alas, anything in Vegas stays in Vegas, and I guess that goes for the bartenders/service we've had here. 

Until we decide to have many more glasses of wine at the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops; cheers!"}
{"text":"You know it's a long wait when Your Apple Watch tells you it's time to get up and move!! 
We had to wait 30min to be seated during a slow time, and then another 15 to get a server to come around.....finally ordered....took 30min after we ordered, to finally get our food....one....at....a...time. I was served first and waited until all were served , and by that time mine was ice cold!! The waitress gave us a hard time for getting extra salsa for my husband's taco's, and a hard time when I asked for a little Parmesan cheese on my lasagna. Like it was a big deal!! 
For the price, you would expect a nicer server, and better overall service!!
Also, you could hang meat in there! I was so cold, I was using my napkin as a blanket!!"}
{"text":"NO PEPPERMINT BARK CHEESECAKE!!!
Signs on the sidewalk, the doors, and the inside, along with promos on TV, but that highly anticipated seasonal special wasn't there! So much for the drive out just to enjoy that! 

Call first if that's what you want!"}
{"text":"This rating is NOT based on the food. The food is good. The staff is exceedingly rude and snotty. I have eaten here a few times and the waiters, servers and hostesses have real attitude problems. They take their time and often throw the menus and the bill on the table. Plain nasty. No thanks. The parking is a nightmare. The rudest server was the petite blonde. Never again! When I go to Cheesecake Factory I prefer the one in Caesar's Palace (even though the dining area is very loud)"}
{"text":"It's Valentine's Day!  Spur of the moment to go to The Cheesecake Factory.  It was quite busy, but the wait for 2 was only 20 minutes.  Not too bad!  We were seated in a booth within 20 minutes.  The staff was courteous and smiled after what you could tell had been a busy night.  

The food came out within a reasonable time.  It was nice and hot (just the way I like it)!  The food was very good too.  BBQ chicken pizza and the Chicken biscuits and gravy.  Both were surprisingly good.  The last time I ate at The Cheesecake Factory, I was not too happy with the food, nor the price I paid.  This time was satisfactory.

Took a piece of the fresh strawberry cheesecake home for later.  The best of their cheesecakes in my opinion and I have tried quite a few.  Left happy and satisfied.  Delicious Valentine's Day dinner."}
{"text":"My brother in law visiting from out of town took me, my wife, and daughter to Cheesecake factory @ Ross Park.  I had ahi tuna tataki salad, it was good but a little on the sweet side. my wife had a chicken salad and enjoyed it. my daughter had  a pasta dish and equally enjoyed it. my brother in law had sheapards pie, also good. The service was fantastic, after we moved table from the loudest place next to the kitchen with loud clanging dishes etc. The atmosphere was incredibly dark to the point all of us had trouble reading the menu and seeing what we were eating. All in all it was just OK, but very overpriced for the quality of food. Overrated."}
{"text":"The food is good as usual. 
Service was great. 
The only thing I noticed is that the portion of my chicken medeira was small haha
That Georgia peach drink was amazing though!"}
{"text":"Yes American sized large portions, Yes American style customer service where wait staff actually smiles and asks how was your day, Yes! Yes! Yes!

I was missing home so I ordered Mexican Taco Salad  and Avocado Southwest Egg Rolls for my lunch... Salad was Huuuuuuja..big enough for two people, delicious, crispy, nice size chicken pieces, ample amount of black beans and fresco...Avocado Southwest Egg rolls were legit...if you have never tried these ..do it!!! Ample amount of Avocado, corn, pieces of tomatoes wrapped around phyllo pastry, savoury, and perfectly fried served with mint chutney!!!! Yum to die for took me back to Texas!

I skipped dessert, so will be back here to try their chicken and biscuits, skinny chicken pot pie, and chocolate cookie dough cheese cake ;-)"}
{"text":"I only been to the Cheescake Factory once. It's definitely somewhere I would go again. Normally I steer clear of expensive restaurants, especially the one's near the strip. I don't care whose paying, im just not into spending $45 on a plate of food. I dont' care how nice or sexy the waiter is. I went here with a friend on Thanksgiving because neither one of us can cook lol. I didn't order anything but a cheescake. From what I can tell the food isn't all that bad, it's also not toooo pricey like I expected it to be. I would definetly want someone to take me here on a date. :)"}
{"text":"I respect any waiter at the Cheesecake Factory for learning the menu.  if you visit their website you have to download a pdf. to see the enormous menu.  Service is normally on point and the menu items seem to be very satisfying.  The location is great for a good size group and ladies always seem to enjoy themselves in the relaxing atmosphere.  

I can't give 5 stars to a location that outsources its cheesecake, its defiantly not produced in house."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in ages so we decided to try this place again. It hasn't changed very much. Still has a huge menu with large portions.  I had the Cajun jambalaya pasta. It was very spicy with really tender chicken over a bed of pasta. I thought it was pretty good. My wife had the pasta over meat sauce which was pretty good but she could only eat half of it. My son had the rib-eye steak and it looked ok but he enjoyed it and my mom had a turkey and guacamole sandwich which was good. The best part of going to this place is the desert and we had the snickers and the red velvet cheesecakes. They were pretty good but not great. The food overall was pretty good. 
The service was ok. It seemed like we had to wait a long time for our food and after we were done eating we had to wait a really long time for the server to come and get our desert order. 
We got there right at 5pm and didn't have to wait for a table. Otherwise, I don't think the food is worth a really long wait."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back here, I guess I think it will be different the next time. I always get the waiter that doesn't care about being there. This last time we had to ask for bread when all of the tables around us had some. Our food came out and my chicken tacos were cold, I sent them back and the manager came out and apologized. He said he would make sure they came out piping hot. After waiting the entire meal for my new tacos to come out, they brought out the same tacos that had obviously just been put under a heat lamp. They had the same bite I had taken when I sent them back. When I complained again, they took it off the bill and avoided our table for the rest of the night except to take the bill. I wish the health inspector would have been there! I am so disgusted, I will never be back. I wish I could give a zero star rating."}
{"text":"The Cheese cakes are good but be prepared for ridiculously slow service at the take out counter.  We waited 20 minutes for a whole cake while at least 10 people after us were served."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Cheesecake Factory!!!

Been there several times (due to my fiance dragging me to South Park for shopping) and every single time the food was awesome. I tend to order their sandwiches as my fiance tends to get their entrees. I've only had one complaint (plain onions instead of the caramelized ones advertised on the menu) but it was minor. 

The service is awesome and the wait times have been short for us (under 5 mins). The star of the menu is the dessert selection. Can't go wrong with any of their cheesecake options. 

So much to try so we will definitely be returning....often!"}
{"text":"So, came here for happy hour.   Nothing happy here.  Left in a sad minute.  The only happy hour items on the menu is half price appetizers from 4-6.  Disappointing because I was looking for happy hour drinks.  None.  Been to the same chain and they had happy hour drinks.  What a shame.   I left. 

This place needs to turn my frown upside down! 

Oh and they have a low sanitation rating."}
{"text":"no wait....most of the time.

My fav's:  

thai chicken wrap.

kids love this...lots of selection and fresh food.

Lots to share."}
{"text":"Just ate at this location with my best friend and enjoyed our little feast. We ordered two of their typhoon martini drinks which were AMAZING & got their zucchini appetizer. Yum. We then ordered the combination meal with steak & salmon & that was delicious. Great service. Truly a perfect dining experience. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Long story short there was 11 of us today and it took an hour after we were done eating to get our checks right and they still were not correct by the 4th time. We waited very patiently but still no manager came by to greet us or help with the situation. After going to several Cheesecake Factory's I would say there food is good but service could be better"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is great, the food is good, but the experience is lacking. Really long wait times to get your food and the restaurant itself was dirty. Sticky menus, dirty floor, unclean silverware and cups (we sent most of it back). I'd recommend getting the cheesecake to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent Steak Diane, great flavors. The dulce de leche cheesecake was also great...Seating areas and chairs are a little tight..."}
{"text":"Typical corporate sterile environment. Limited corporate mega brewery beer offerings-Sorry Four Peaks is not local anymore. Generous portions for sure but service left a lot to be desired. I think the servers were assigned to too many tables and couldn't keep up. Our water and iced tea glasses were left empty for way to long.  Cheesecake of course was good but for the prices they charge it better be,"}
{"text":"This is a great location. Everytime I have been here either it be for dinner take out or just drinks the food and the staff have never let me down. 

They are always super busy but you usually don't wait long to get in. The staff makes sure your taken care of, the only time I've had to really wait was when paying the bill. They could use more registers but that's such a small thing. 

Next time you go get the fried chicken sliders. Especially if your not that hungry because we all know how big those Cheesecake Factory portions are. You get 4 and they are SOOOO good. The bartenders here are super friendly and make great recommendations. I wish  I could remember that one guys name because he is the best!"}
{"text":"Hands down always delicious!!! Consistency is definitely key here.  You'll never be disappointed.  Vanilla Bean Cheesecake!!! The BEST! 
Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane, to Die for! 
Jambalaya & Gumbo BOMB.COM"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my brother's graduation. The food was subpar, but the cheesecake was good albeit overly sugary. The service was the wort out of all the places we ate on the trip. If I ever visit Phoenix again I will pass here. The good thing was the cheesecake and the decor and that's about it."}
{"text":"I liked their food, recently moved from CA to AZ and love to celebrate my b-day. We both had a steak, my partner had Diane steak which was delicious and I had the Steak from the skinny menu. Both dishes were yummy.
Here what I got very disappointed the cheesecake with the tiramisu was not what I used to have, hardly any tiramisu did not test like one in CA."}
{"text":"5 stars for a national chain?  sure, why not.  our experience was awesome.  arrived at 1130am on a Saturday.  drinks brought immediately.  food arrived fast and hot and delicious!  our server (Mikayla D) was AMAZING.  attentive and friendly.  we ordered two apps, chicken quesadilla and avocado/mushroom/zucchini fried sticks.  the quesadilla was way overpriced at 12 bucks, not good bang for your buck.  but the other app was huge and way worth the $6.  main course, i got a \"skinny\" vegetable salad (yum) and hubby got the shepherd's pie.(huge and he said yum).  located just across street from Suncoast.  first time here, and have stayed at Suncoast 50 times in last 10 years.  we will be back!  we were just sad we were too full for dessert!"}
{"text":"With a rich atmosphere, pleasant wait staff, and food to die for, this restaurant is truly something special

My wife and I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade, Stuffed Mushrooms, Chicken Bellagio, and Mahi Mahi Mediterranean. 

Every morsel of what we ate was divine.

I highly recommend the mushrooms, and trying the Bellagio put my mouth in food Heaven.

Tiana C was extremely pleasant waiting on us, and other than maybe prices being a \"smidge\" high, and I do mean just a smidge, there's nothing I would change about Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"This place in general is average. Never exceptional.  I arrived for lunch at 10:59 doors locked. 11:02 doors open. Why not open 10 minutes early?? Don't make customers wait outside.sat down was not served for 10 minutes. Had various waiters help us then after 20 minutes of waiting watching others getting their food , people that had arrived after us, our food arrived with apologies that a take out order took all their time. 

The enchiladas we had ordered were cold. After waiting another 5 minutes to flag down a waiter we were told they could reheat it.  They took the food away and brought the salad bowls back asking us if we wanted to eat that while we waited. They had offered my salad to my guest and hers to me, wtf... I then told them to start from scratch and remake it all and she proceeded to look at me with a totally bewildered look. I repeated this and she just went \"but, but,but\". Having had enough and 40 minutes into this circus I left 5 bucks for the ice tea and told her to tell the manager to get their s$$t together then left. Who has hours to mess around at lunch."}
{"text":"This place is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. 

Been here before, food has gone downhill! 15.95 for 4 pieces of VERY tiny pieces of fish with approximately 15 fries. Absolutely absurd! Server was alright. 
Our party will not be back. Embarrassing to come for a birthday party dinner to have the food suck!"}
{"text":"Happy 400th Review and I am dedicating #400 to The Cheesecake Factory. 
Why The Cheesecake Factory? 
The Reason: This Cheesecake Factory location holds special memories I will never ever forget, I celebrated most of my anniversaries here at this Cheesecake Factory location, the very first celebration was our 7th, which I remember like it was yesterday. We have been back every year,since our 7th. That's many anniversaries here!! 

This recent anniversary was our 21st Anniversary and I wanted to keep the tradition going. 
Although we do have a Cheesecake factory in Hawaii, which I need the energy, to get to Waikiki and with the very long wait, I don't really visit this location back home often. 
This is why, I really look forward to February, our Anniversary. 

I Really do enjoy all my visits to this Cheesecake Factory location, located in the Forum Shops at Caesars adjacent to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip far north side of the mall. This Cheesecake Factory is HUGE with 2 levels. During my recent visit, we got our table right away after checking in with the hostess, we went after the dinner rush, which was close to 8 pm. 

We always end up ordering our usual, but I still like to glance thru the famous 10 page storybook menu with 200 menu items. I like to see what new items are available. The loaded baked potato tots sounded tempting so I also got that along with our usual. 

Here is what we always order, our anniversary tradition. 

Fried Calamari, came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce, They make the best fried calamari, cooked just right, light and crisp. 

Did you know that Cheesecake Factory has Miso Salmon? 
Our entrée are the Miso Salmon X 2, fresh salmon marinated in miso, served with snow peas and white rice. I always request well done on my salmon. The miso sauce, rice, & snow peas just went so great together. We enjoyed this entrée. 

Loaded baked potato tots, Crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon, & green onion, served with sour cream. I didn't care for this tots, I was expecting tots with the stuff separate, like nachos style. It was too rich, we didn't finish this tots. 

We always get our alcoholic beverage and we need to make room for cheesecake. Never leave Cheesecake Factory with out eating a cheesecake, that's too crazy!

The grand finale : cheesecake, deciding on what cheesecake to get is the hard part, with tons of flavors to choose from, My wonderful hubby always lets me choose, we are too stuffed to have our own cheesecake.  For our anniversary cake, I went with the salted caramel, enjoying every delicious bite. 

Note: for any celebration, Cheesecake factory will decorate your cheesecake, free of charge.

{"text":"Ok well the Thai  coconut chicken is hot and spicy. I asked and advised the waitress that I can't handle anything hot when it came and I tried it it had jalapeño s in it and I couldn't eat it ....  so nice enough to offer something else.  So I would double , triple check how much the wait staff know about the menu, if this was an allergy I sure would of been in trouble......"}
{"text":"Really clean , really busy we waited about 20minutes to be seated which is pretty good for a Sunday night.  We didn't wait long to meet our waiter who was friendly,funny  and checked up on us frequently. The bread was hot, fresh and delicious. They gave us a good amount of time to place our order and our food came quick. The appetizer we ordered was spinach artichoke dish which was delicious and plenty. We were pretty much stuffed from the dip plate and the bread. My son had the kids mac n cheese and says the cheesiness was just right, he liked that it was not yellow. He also like that he got several refills on his sprite and if this review was up to just him he would give it a 5 star rating. 
My daughter had the kids spaghetti and one meatball. She claims the meatball crust was too hard and the noodles were too thick but the sauce was good and the meatball was flavorful. She also would rather have another meatball and less noodles.
Daddy had the steak Dianne. He ordered it medium well but it came out medium rare but was ok with it because of the quality if the steak. The mashed potatoes was plentiful and really yummy. Some of the mushrooms were burnt but it did not mess up the taste. This dish had less sauce this time than it usually does but all the flavors were still there. 
I had the chicken picatta. The noodles were aldente. The dish was very flavorful but very light on the stomach as well.
We were anxious to get to dessert and share a raspberry type cheesecake but our stomachs got full too quick.
Our waiter was quick to come back with the check and To go boxes.
The bathrooms were clean and well supplied.
This restaurant is on our list for our special occasion spots."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is great! Their cheesecake is delicious and mouth watering. The staff is amazing! My favorite part of this place along with mine and my husbands experience is a waiter name Adam Cooley! He is a great catch! I can tell he really enjoys what he does and was so on point with everything. Adam made our experience the best experience ever since it was my husbands first time at any cheesecake factory. Adam took the best care of us and we will come more to see him."}
{"text":"We were here around 12:00 pm and waiting for about 1 hr in line to get the pager. We got the number 27 and the server told us it takes about 60 mins to get the seat. 
  HOWEVER, the pager DO NOT have any response after almost 3 hrs. Therefore we decided go back to the reception to find the reason. 
  The receptionist extremely UNPROFESSIONAL and NO ANY APOLOGIES, even the guests before us already finished meal but definitely there is something wrong with the pager! 
  Even like this, they didn't give us any solutions and response, No apology and with cold face. We have to stand there about another 20 mins to get the seat!!!!

Will NEVER EVER come back and do not want to pay the tips!"}
{"text":"Normally  a nice sunny day in Vegas means having lunch on the patio, today it meant a rude waiter and attitude. Edgar, you're a terrible waiter. Being a waitress on the strip for six years and with the company for 10 I know what guest service is... You, are terrible. First off, coming to the table and not making eye contact with the people you are speaking to is not ok. Second your stance is confrontational, almost like you were looking to brawl. It's aggressive and not very welcoming. I would like to say you were at some point just overwhelmed with your tables but as I continued to watch you, I realized, no you're just a terrible waiter. You didn't care to engage you didn't care to answer questions and you didn't even bring me out spoons for my cheese cake. Seriously, who brings dessert and no spoons? I would like to point out that I wanted another orange juice and my boyfriend another glass of wine but you wouldn't know because you never asked. It's ok Also, I get there are busboys but if they aren't around it means you clear my table, you're not above clearing a table. For the record I cleared most of my dishes onto the dirty table next to me since my table wasn't cleaned once during our meal. I did have to ask twice for the check the second time you pretended like I never asked a first time. You're also human and not above being able to say I forgot let me go get it. But passing blame is easier. What a stressful lunch. Honestly, my cheese cake didn't even taste good after all this. My experience out weighed the potential to have a good lunch. It will be a while if I ever come back to eat here I would be too afraid to have your section. Not to mention kona grill is remodeled and looking way more appealing than a waiter who seems to want to fight me and ignore me."}
{"text":"decided to come here after shopping and check how long the wait was. it was about 20 mins for table of 2 around 4pm sunday afternoon so we waited. 

service was very good and i ordered the bistro shrimp pasta and my mom ordered the crispy chicken pineapple rice. the shrimp pasta is so delicious especially because it had a lemony tasting sauce and i love lemon in pasta. they also gave a few extra slices of lemon and i squeezed it in my pasta and it was the perfect amount of lemon flavour. the spaghetti was a little hard but it was still yummy. definitely must try it u like lemon flavour. there was also a fair amount of shrimp in it. also it comes with mushrooms but i asked for no mushrooms bc i don't like it. my mom said the crispy chicken pineapple was 4.5/5 pretty good it's sweet and sour with the pineapples. 

got a celebration cheesecake and salted caramel but asked for to go since we were too full after our meals. the cheesecakes are big, good portion and the celebration one is yummy haven't tried the caramel one yet but i'm sure it's yummy too. 

overall amazing experience but i'd only come for special occasions bc it is expensive."}
{"text":"Das war ein Käsekuchenerlebnis der besonderen Art. Wir hatten den Original und den Saltet Caramel und was soll ich sagen - der Laden heißt Cheesecake Factory und das bekommt er auch in Spitzenklasse hin. Die hausgemachte Limonade ist ebenso zu empfehlen.

Ich mochte auch die Einrichtung, sehr angenehm mit den kleinen Sitzecken. Auch die anderen Speisen sagen richtig gut aus. Vor allem hatte ich hier mal den Eindruck, dass man sich mit den Salaten auch mal einigermaßen gesund ernähren kann.

Bedienung war prompt und äußerst nett. Da kommen wir auf jedenfall wieder."}
{"text":"Food has very nice presentation, not just thrown together.  Staff if friendly and thorough, atmosphere makes you feel as though you're on vacation even if you're a local.  The Navajo sandwich fry- bread is as close to pow-wow fresh as you can get, and the Mai-tais are super smooth (dangerous!)  Will def come here again."}
{"text":"When we are in Vegas we love to check out the surrounding areas too.  After visiting Green Valley Ranch resort and the Shops at Green Valley ranch we decided to go here to eat some lunch.  We ordered the Skinnylicious Mexican salad and the Chicken lettuce tacos.  The tacos were a-ok.  The salad was very good with  Corn Tortilla ... topped with Chicken Breast and Black Beans with Mixed Greens, Corn, Green Onion and Cilantro.  Tossed in a Vinaigrette and a little Avocado  , Salsa and Sour Cream.  After eating off of the skinnylicious menu and not feeling too guilty we ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake.  If you like Red velvet cake and Cheesecake this is a must have.  Moist layers of Red Velvet Cake (I hate when its dry) with cheesecake in between.  Cheesecake frosting.  Delicious.   After that we felt a bit guilty but very satisfied.  Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is my first review and it might as well be on the ever-so-hyped Cheesecake Factory that just newly opened up in Toronto. We got there at 5pm on a Wednesday and were lucky enough to get seated just before falling victim to the infamous wait time..noice! 
I love the physical appeal of the restaurant inside; it almost makes me feel like something out of Alice in Wonderland. The establishment does a great job of taking warm colours and still managing to create a cool-dim and relaxed atmosphere. 

Our Order:

Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp
Supposed to be a spicy Thai curry dish with flavours of peanut and coconut on a bed of rice. I'm a lover of sweet-savoury but what we got was way too sweet and coconutty. Couldn't tell there was even curry because it wasn't spicy at all and we found a couple un-dissolved jelly like chunks of something that was giving the dish it's overwhelming sweet taste. Desert was supposed to be cheesecake, not this. 

Cajun Jambalaya Pasta
Ordered this based the pictures, sautéed chicken and shrimp, with onions, tomato and peppers with spicy Cajun sauce on top of linguini. Unfortunately it looks better than it tastes, this dish seriously lacked some flavour. This had literally NO SPICE, it was topped with paprika and Cajun powder but it tasted so bland, even the tomatoes didn't stand out. I know what you're thinking, \"brown guy saying it's lacking spice .. what else is new?\" but oh no my friend you are mistaken. I actually prefer my spice level at mild so trust me when I say that your whitest friend's grandmother who grew up eating mashed potatoes and broccoli would say that this was a sad excuse for pasta sauce.

Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake
The signature classic go-to cheesecake, nuff said. At least the restaurant didn't screw up what they're famous for. Loved every bit of it, but it was so decadent that I was glad I was sharing it, less guilt in split calories! 
Our server's name was Marc-Anthony who was actually a really cool guy. He told us he was new and actually asked us how our day was and had a great conversation throughout our time at TCF. His service really made up for the poor quality of food. The staff are generally very friendly here. I would come back for the desert but the food is definitely not worth the price tag. At the very least I'd come back with my own hot sauce because all they had as an excuse for seasoning was chilli flakes.

Food: 6.5/10
Desert: 10/10
Atmosphere: 9/10
Overall Value: 7/10"}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Overpriced, underwhelming food.  The burgers are ok.  The cheesecake is whipped (i.e., not good).  

I can't believe I spent $70 here.  It makes me die a little to write that.  Never again."}
{"text":"Every so often we get the impulse to go to CCF for dinner because of the variety of menu items that will please all the members of our party. But, after we've waited two hours for a table, wait for bread to come to the table, wait for our entrees, wait for a server to make sure we are \"ok\" with our meals, wait for tea refills, wait for our check to be closed out. One conclusion can be drawn: his place is over rated. Way over rated. The"}
{"text":"Today I was a bit disappointed in my experience at the Cheesecake Factory. I couldn't get cheesecake because my trainer took me there to reward me for working so hard. What a scrumptious delight it would have been to get a slice of Snickers or the Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple cheesecake. Hmmm, those so good I want to slap my momma. Instead, I indulged on the Cajun Chicken Jambalaya and the brown bread. The waitress filled up my Sprite three times. ( Too much soda, I know.) We were seated immediately and given exemplary service."}
{"text":"Crispy crab bites were good, but the water tasted like swimming pool water and my enchiladas were drowning in so much sauce they were hard to eat. Just not very good overall."}
{"text":"My visit at the Cheesecake Factory was not for the obvious reasons. For National Cheesecake Day, the Cheesecake Factory was offering half-off a slice of cheesecake which was the only reason I went. There was a line to get to the hostess but she did a great job keeping everything in order. I only had to wait thirty minutes to get seated. Our waiter was very personable and knew about the new cheesecake flavor that came out that day. I was pleasantly surprised that we got complimentary bread. Of the two options, I liked the wheat better than the white. For my cheesecake, I chose the fresh strawberry cheesecake. It was not bad nor awesome. The cream part of the cheesecake was smooth but did not have the flavor of cream cheese. The graham cracker crust did not hold up well. I did not know that the fresh strawberry cheesecake cost slightly more than the other more elaborate cheesecake so I was slightly shocked when my bill came. The mediocre cheesecake did not make me want to come back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, Ive been to the Cheesecake Factory plenty of times but as server this was the worst experience of my life, and I'm not even exaggerating. 
The server Leticia started off decent.... she didn't know how to discuss one of the entrees with my cousin and was coming off very rude and stand off ish. On a Monday night we waited approximately 35-40 minutes on our food. Our water was empty for almost 30 mins while we waited for our food that had to be sent back several times. My aunt ordered a pasta dish that had a basil drizzle as a garnish (that was not listed) and sent it back, it took 20 mins to receive that entree (everyone was finished with their meal). There was many server errors within this experience such as bringing sauce when food is complete, not enagaging in our request, slamming spoons on the table for dessert, the list can go on. My biggest issue is ordering a salmon for  $21 and it was cold...which is ok however, when I asked for it to be sent back, when it came back to the table the entree was STILL cold! At this point I wanted to talk to a manger or something, CJ the manager who came over had every excuse in the book as to why my salmon, mashed potatoes, asparagus and cream sauce was borderline freezing (as if taken out of the cooler). He was standing there kind of going back and forth with myself and my cousin (both of which are server) trying to justify my cold dish. I specifically told him to make me a BRAND new piping hot salmon and I want it to go because we are on a time constraint and we have to leave. 2-5 minutes later he shows up with my ORIGINAL salmon in a to go container over a plate and it is STILL cold. I am pissed the h**l off! 
This night was supposed to be an amazing night for my family and I and turned out to be the worst experience I've ever had or one that I've ever seen. To top it off this fool comped my dessert as well as my aunts food but my Salmon that had issue was still on the bill. 
Because I know how this industry works paying $158 for this experience is not sitting well with me and I do not recommend this location whatsoever, this restaurant was very unprofessional and unpleasant as if it was their first day on the job. 
My family and I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been to many a Cheesecake Factory, and this one was no different... And that's a good thing! We went here for lunch, while walking the strip.  The food and service are on par, and you can't beat sitting on the \"Patio\" and watching the fish and tourists walk by.  You even get some romantic mood lighting and action brought to you in part by the \"Neptune, King of the Ocean\" Show playing sporadically throughout  your meal.  We got a kick out of this.  I always love the Santa Fe avocado rolls and the Chinese Chicken salad... Sometimes it's good just to go for something you like, and save the \"adventurous eating\" for dinner that night."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for lunch or brunch. I never make it to desert! Extensive menu to choose from."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this restaurant last night and I was so disappointed. The server was great and the restaurant Itself looks lovely but what good is that if the food is going to be horrible! No one liked what they ordered the only thing I enjoyed was the appetizer and my glass of wine. We had to return a couple pasta plates because they were so salty I mean really salty unable to consume. May I add these plates are around 20 bucks each. You can find way better restaurants for the same price range even cheaper. We should've gone to the vig like we initially planned but we wanted to try something new. Oh well now we know we for sure won't be returning. Lots of better food options out there!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mac and Cheese Burger.

Dreadful Pizza.

..There were ants on the table."}
{"text":"I am back to being a Cheesecake Factory customer. I have had several bad experiences at this location, from the customer service to the horrible food. My family decided to try the Cheesecake Factory one more time, since we had a family member that wanted to try it. When we arrived the hostess greeted us and then we were seated with a fantastic waiter named Alex. He was very knowledgeable when it came to the food and recommended a pasta that was just sooooo delicious. He was fun and attentive and really changed our opinion about this location. I will always ask for Alex with the glass and the cool hair."}
{"text":"2 star dinner with 5 star service with 2 star facilities.  Philly cheese steak sandwich was quite average.  Too much bell pepper and steak a little too thick to be great.  The steak was seasoned well, as were the sweet potato fries.  Breakfast is served all day.  The omelet was huge (easily enough for 2 hungry people) but nothing special.  Needed a little salt.  It was served with potatoes fried with onions.  Didn't look all that appetizing because the onions were in a big clump instead of being more evenly dispersed.  The restaurant floor was not wet but slippery.  It felt to me like someone spilled something oily and it got tracked around.  The men's restroom was very disappointing.  Had a long puddle of water under the sinks.  Granted, it was after 9:00 with a 10:00 closing time but I still expect better from a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been there multiple times to have their cheesecake but today, I went there for lunch. Oh boy.. the food was delicious and the service was awesome. 

03/17/2018: the Nth visit ... food and service were great as always. No wonder I keep coming here every time I'm in town"}

{"text":"Good Happy Hour prices...full sized appetizers for less than half the price...$5 and and most are around $12 normally. Plus $5 tall Mojitos. Usually hit the Chandler Mall location on a day of shopping, and have never had a bad meal and service always good"}
{"text":"Stop by to this place last night around 9:15 pm to grab a couple slicies of pie from the bakery and was cashed out by Korena that took awhile to notice that i was there to order a pie. All the employee are very distracted and talking among them w/o looking around to see if there is customers out there waiting to order. Korena wasn't a pleasant person just kind smart ass girl. I ordered Linda's fudge cake which i love but very disappointed with the size of the cake this time. Vey tasty but too small. I thought all the cakes were cut up before placed in the display! I guess not cuz this lady cut iup n boxed it up for me. I love cheese cake factory n the food but the bakery area needs to work on better their customer service. I usually go to Green Valley location which has great people working for the bakery that make u feel very welcome n feeling like coming back often."}
{"text":"95 minute wait...they don't take reservations on Saturday nights. Food is typical to the chain.  Another location I went to was a much better experience. Best advice get food to go unless you have a lot to shop.for in the mall"}
{"text":"Can't miss with the chix salad sandwich. Splitted it with the chopped salad. Yum o.  Jennifer was a great server. Thanks.  Surprised to see how quiet it was. Thank god because we were hungry.   Finished with the new salted Carmel cheesecake. Very good."}
{"text":"It's like any other Cheesecake Factory out there, though with all the common problems I have with TCF this one stood out because of our great server, Brittaney.

The bread served was good, I'm always a fan of sourdough but they were hardly warm.

For apps, I had the Tuna Tartare which was good, strong in flavor but the portion was way too small for something to cost $7. It came with barely enough fried off wontons to eat with the tartare.

I split the Louisiana Chicken pasta and even so the portion was filling. Good pasta with a kick to eat, creamy sauce and perfectly fried chicken. 

For dessert I went with something light, so I decided on the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. It was a bit too warm for my liking as I like my cheesecakes cold. The flavor was light and not too sweet though.

Our server Brittaney was so nice and gave great suggestions! A great waitstaff here overall. I suppose it's just the food here that can be a hit or miss and the price point is way more than what it should be."}
{"text":"Today I got the Cheesecake Factory and I had a pulled pork sandwich it was really good and so was the cheesecake but when I ordered my salad and it came with Thousand Island dressing the Thousand Island dressing literally tasted rotten and made me so sick I love going to the Cheesecake Factory but I will not return after this experience"}
{"text":"Although not my first pick, my wife loves it. Food is always good....just not my fancy.  Service always spot on!! Extremely weird but for whatever reason, I've only had cheesecake here a couple times. It's good for sure...but I wouldn't come here just for it. A good value and definitely a recommendation!!"}
{"text":"I worked at a fine dining restaurant for years and still think cheescake had us beat. Place is fire, portions are enormous and it actually sucks because its difficult to get more than 1 item. Also make sure you get the mac n cheese balls-incredible. And the adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple is the best cheescake there."}
{"text":"If you're dining at the cheesecake factory as a party of one or two, they will often try to stick you in one of their tiny, little tables. You literally sit five inches from the guests beside of you. This may not be a problem for some, but I always make sure to ask for a booth to avoid these tables. This place has a HUGE menu. I don't think you can go wrong with what you choose, though. My favorite dish is the shepherds pie. It's a huge portion and so delicious. I like that, during lunchtime, you can get the half portion. I usually still end up taking some home! If you're not starving, I recommend getting the cuban rolls, which are an appetizer. I enjoy the cuban sandwich, but actually love these even more. They're so crispy and come with a great dipping sauce. Oh, and the cheesecake is a must- duh. Even if you have to take it to-go. I've had so many of their cheesecakes and just can't choose a favorite. You seriously cannot go wrong! Try this place next time you are in the Southpark area!"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute worst service. Management sucks. Their food is mediocre at best. I literally can not understand why they ever busy."}
{"text":"This was my first time finally getting to go to the cheesecake factory since they've opened and it seemed that a lot of people were hyping about it so i wanted to experience it myself and see what the hype was all about. 

My experience i had there was good. I got the chicken crusted parmesan dish which tasted pretty good, but it was too salty which i would assume to be because of the amount of cheese on the chicken and the green beans that came with it could've been boiled more in my opinion. The portion size of the food is pretty big and very filling so i felt i got my money worth when it comes to that. Also, the waiter we got was very nice and he made a lot of jokes with his guests which made the experience even better.

However, the waiting time isn't getting any better and i wouldn't expect to any time soon just because with it being the only location in Toronto its pretty busy especially in the evenings. We waited 70 mins to be seated, but we did walk around the mall which made the time pass by more quickly. 

I will for sure be returning again, but would try something different on the menu. Oh and yes the cheesecake slice is small for it to be $10."}
{"text":"Why does the cheesecake factory only have 3stars ? The appetizers alone are always banging and who doesn't like free bread ??? Let's take a moment and notice the menu options are vast , the prices as well but come on there's more than enough food given to keep you satisfied and not too hurt on the $$. If you are a cheese cake fan they have one for every person . I simply can't get enough of the potstickers , the sauce is heavenly . Minus the long waits , it's not a horrible restaurant ... Try the Jamaican black pepper shrimp , or the Kobe burger , maybe in the mood for egg rolls , both the Tex mex and avocado are delicious ."}
{"text":"I use to be a regular at the Cheesecake Factory when the opened in Marina Del Rey.   The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure you were well taken care off.  

Let's move forward many yrs down the road.  The staff Doesn't seem to care and heaven forbid they check up on you. 

Brian was hardly anywhere to be found and the only time I saw him was to give us our bill and pick it up.  

Our youth today doesn't know anything about customer service."}
{"text":"Don't know why I haven't reviewed this place yet.  I literally find myself going to this place a lot for work meetings.  Today, a bunch of us came by to hold a manager meeting.  Instead of using a boring conference room, why not hold it at a restaurant.  Can we say expense it! LOL.

For my meal, I got the regular size Miso Salmon plate for $19.95.  Start off with big serving of grilled salmon on a plateau of brown rice (or white if you prefer), surrounded by a butter sauce with pockets of sweet Miso sauce and garnished with Chinese peas.  I LOVED the Salmon.  The fish was perfectly grilled and had a wonderful light char on the skin.  The flesh was juicy and flavorful.  Great accompaniment with the Miso sauce.  I personally found that the butter sauce was waaay too rich and appreciated having the Chinese peas around to break up the monotony of  the rich butter sauce.  Other than that, the dish is on point.  

The ambiance was great.  Always a vibrant atmosphere with dramatic lighting and decor.  I feel like I'm in the middle of Europe, yet not.  LOL.  This is a place you must visit once in your life. I've always had great experiences and will continue frequenting this place."}
{"text":"Arrived at The Cheesecake Factory at 12:15pm this Saturday. We had a party of five (No it's not the tv show). We were seated immediately and waited five minutes for bread and ten minutes for drinks. Our order was taken five minutes after our drinks were dropped off. I do enjoy the wheat bread here and their house lemonade with sugar on the rim. Our orders were taken, after 40 minutes of waiting we'd all had enough. As I stood to go grab a manager the waiter explained  \"Your order is on its way!\" From where? Antarctica!? I asked the girls at reception for a manager, he showed up quickly. I was extremely kind, but very matter of fact with him about the time it had taken to receive our food. The manager walked back to my table with me as three waiters scurried to quickly place the food on the table. The manager abruptly left, not cool! The food was warm and tasted fine, however there where several mistakes with our orders including hair in my wife's food, right on top of her steak. We didn't receive a discount or even an apology. I won't be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"We really like Cheesecake Factory. The food is great  although a bit pricey. And the cheesecake is delicious. It gets really crowded on weekends and pretty much every night of the week. Still worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food is good but they need to learn how to take reservations. A 2 hour wait is just not acceptable."}
{"text":"The restaurant appeared to be extremely crowded from the outside, but we were seated immediately. The restaurant turned out to be quite spacious inside! Service was decent and friendly. The dimmed lighting and private booths created a nice, cozy atmosphere which made our experience highly enjoyable. 

We were presented with toasty garlic bread which we all loved. I tried quite a few entrees. I thought the pasta da vinci, garlic noodles, and chopped salsbury steak were all unimpressive, but the fettuccine Alfredo and Kobe beef burger were both very delicious! The fettuccine's creamy Parmesan sauce was very good, and the burger was a great value at just $12.99. Yum!

For dessert we shared the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae and the glazed strawberry cheesecake. Creamy and dreamy, both were very good!

This restaurant offers quality food and lovely ambiance at a very affordable price. Quite an ideal venue for a romantic date or special dinner with family or friends! 

My only gripe was that the silverware was extremely dirty! I could literally wipe white film from my spoon and pick cookie crumbs from my fork... However, our server was nice enough to bring us new utensils AND wipe them down at our table for us, ha."}
{"text":"This location sucks.
Made reservations the day before and was seated 15 mins after the reservation time. Our server sucked completely. He was given way too many tables and barely checked on us. 

The food was okay, the pasta was still hard and forgot a few of our items and still charged us. The Jamaican shrimp were awesome, avocado toast was perfect, shrimp sausage pasta was horrible, alfredo was bad, kids meal was fine (I had to take a bite of my brothers food) After 20 minutes, the manager came by and took it off. 

Definitely going to the other locations cause their food is bombbbbb."}
{"text":"Another wilted salad... Cobb salad with barley any avocado or bacon... and for this price it should be organic... but no! Oh and thanks for the mall employee discount (that doesn't exist)!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is always lit. Their food is really good and although it's pricey, the portion sizes are massive so it's worth it. I also really liked the drink i got, it was a blueberry mojito and it was bomb. Our waiter did take a while to come around to take our order and all of that, but it was pretty busy and most importantly he was really nice :) definitely a great location to go! but, it is a little loud so if you enjoy quiet restaurants i would not choose this one haha"}
{"text":"Received a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory for Christmas, and my husband I stopped in to use it while running errands in the area one afternoon.

I haven't eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in years, and it was about what I expected. Large variety with decent food and service.

My husband ordered two apps for his meal- chicken samosas and the fried Mac and cheese balls.

The chicken samosas were very good. I'd return for those alone. The seasoning was very flavorful and the dipping sauce was delicious. The Mac and cheese balls were solid but could use more flavor in the Mac and cheese itself.


It was the tail end of brunch, and since I hadn't eaten breakfast, I ordered the chilaquiles. The were eggs over cooked and so was pork, but the sauce good.

The service was friendly but a little slow. My drink took quite a long time to come out, as did our food.

We were too stuffed to eat it there, but we did get a slice of classic cherry cheesecake to go. I ate it a few hours later, and it was perfect.

I'm not rushing to go back to Cheesecake Factory, but next time, I'd stick to apps and cheesecake."}
{"text":"So this place really isn't the spot that is first on the list to eat for Yeep snobbery, but whether you like their food or reputation it's always a place you know what you're getting and is consistent. 

The menu is large and some of that isn't great, but a few things I do like. This visit the BF and I shared the chicken and biscuit. The menu is huge and this was more than enough of a hearty dish to share. We each had a heap of mash potato, a filet of chicken, roasted carrots and a biscuit each. It was actually pretty good....think of a chicken pot pie, deconstructed with biscuits. 

Really, I just wanted some cheesecake. I don't like any of the rich flavored ones they do as they are way too sweet and dense. I like the mango key lime which the tartness is nice with the creaminess and we also got a raspberry one which was decent, but the mango key lime was still better. 

The service was friendly and pretty decent with refills. She brought us some warm bread and also had the kitchen split our meal into 2 plates.  

I rarely go, because why when we have so many options here, but sometimes you just need to Cheesecake."}
{"text":"During the week before Christmas i visited this location and both times I ordered the same thing.  Both times I had to sent the food back because the plate was too hot to handle but the food was lukewarm at best.  after the 2nd time in 7 days i decided to post a review with the Company itself.  I did get a human reply all i got was a gift card.  I have not been back until this past Saturday,.210/218, thinking it might e better. I took a friend out for his birthday.  We waited for about 40 minute to get a seat due to being busy.....Once seated we had to wait forever for our server.  Her greeting was \"Do you know what you want\"  NOt hi, hello or whatever.  /after we ordered we had to ask for drinks, silverware which was handed to us without napkins.  I Had to go to the bar to get napkins.  When he fod came  again  it was the same.  I even ordered a different entree thinking t might make the difference.  The plate was placed on the table with a cloth napkin because the plate was so hot.  When I Tasted the food the chicken was luke warm and the tomatoes er cold.  It took forever o get their attention when she finally came over I explained the situation o her. She never said anything took the plate and returned with the food 10 minutes later.  I tted it immediately and the same happened , plate too hot and the food lukewarm.  I called the manager over and we had a chat and he apologized and and wanted to com the meal and i said no this is the gift card use it.  He took the gift card and used it for one meal and comped the other.  Then we ordered cheesecake and i ended up going over to the seser counter and getting my own....The overall experience is a 2 at best  ...i will never return to this location"}
{"text":"Love the Cheesecake Factory, always have...every time I have dined there both the service and food were outstanding, and I can't remember ever ordering a dish that I ended up disliking.  I wish the cheesecake was just a little bit more reasonably priced, but that's about my only criticism."}
{"text":"First time to eat here. Don't understand why we had to give our name and wait to be called before being seated as we were one of the first customers they had and the place was still empty.  It did fill up fast though.  Over all a good experience. Was busy at opening with people waiting to get in. Service seemed a little slow and we had to wait quite some time for our food.  Mostly the only complaint I have.  Though a slice of cheesecake was a bit much at $7.95,  but I guess they have to make their money someway. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Ummmm.... I wish I could have given this place a 5 star, but no. Every dish I have gotten here has always been delicious, let me just say that. I always get the salmon dish, one of them is not on the menu anymore (which is sad ), but they have another one that is delicious. The Cheesecake of course is fantastic (the Godiva, I highly recommend). Here comes a bit of a rant. If Cheesecake Factory is reading this, PLEASE start taking reservations on weekends. A close friend of mine loves this restaurant, so we decided to take her on a Saturday night to this place to celebrate. They do not take reservations on weekends. I get there and there is literally a 3 hour wait... My jaw dropped, this place was packed. I could hardly get in the entrance door. People were running into me, I was running into them, yikes . I don't see how many of those people even got seated. There is no way. We ended up taking our party else where. Just be aware of this if you decide to go there on a weekend night. Service is just ok, some are more attentive than others, but a nice place. I will be going there again, but not on a weekend night. On weekdays it's quick to be seated."}
{"text":"I always love going to this place! The service is great. Even though it was pretty crowded, we were seated right away and our server was attentive and helpful. Had the meatloaf and it was really good and I had plenty of leftovers! And of course, I topped off the meal with a piece of cheesecake. I am always shocked at how huge their cheesecake menu is. I have never been disappointed with any of the cheesecake there."}
{"text":"There was line, but it moved fast!!  The the server was very attentive and the good and drinks were quick and delicious!!  We went on a Friday night and in Vegas normally takes forever at almost any restaurant, but not here!! Great service totally!!"}
{"text":"AVOID!! AVOID!! AVOID!!

I have always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory chain and have dined at several of their establishments along the East Coast.  Sadly, my experience at this particular establishment was by far the worst in my life.

My family had planned for weeks on eating at the Cheesecake Factory in South Side for my brothers college graduation dinner.  We called ahead and were told you could not make reservations.  

Upon our arrival there were only a few groups waiting.  We were told it would be a 40 minute wait.  This was expected since we had a party of 8.  However, while waiting we noticed some groups seemed to have special treatment and had been allowed to make reservations.  We checked on the wait several times and were continuously told we were next.  They even went as far as to tell they were pushing tables together.  We watched as party after party who had arrived after us were seated.  Even large parties of 20, 12, and 9.  

After an hour it was clear something was wrong.  My brother, who was supposed to be celebrating his graduation, questioned the hostess on the protocol of seating customers.  She assured we were next and that it was first come first serve.  He pointed out that everyone who had arrived after us has been given tables.  She said he was wrong and that we would be next.  2 minutes later she seated a party of 9 before us.

After waiting an hour and never being given a table.  Our entire party walked out unfed and angry.  It's a shame that loyal paying customers would be treated that way.

Grab a slice of cheesecake to go and head elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Sat down and enjoyed the rib-eye steak with my girlfriend for our 1 year anniversary. The meal came out delicious and in a very timely manner, and our visit was much more remarkable because of our server Alex McKeen! Was very kind and moved with a purpose. 10/10 would recommend this location and asking for Alex."}
{"text":"Food and service great as always. I've never had a bad experience at any of the Cheesecake Factory locations."}
{"text":"We ordered drinks as we sat down  and we waited 20 min ,no water, no drinks and no bread and the food arrived before anything and we have to ask for drinks again .terrible service.on the bright side the manager heared
Our disappointment and came and wanted to give us complimentary dessert... but I am not there for free stuff so I refused the offer but I appreciated the effort made."}
{"text":"Great place to stop and rest your feet in the forum shops. Service was great and the wait time wasn't long at all in all aspects - seating and waiting for food. The staff was very accommodating when we asked for a different table due to mobility concerns and didn't extend our wait at all. This place is consistently great and always a solid choice."}
{"text":"I work in the Forum Shops so I eat here more often than most. I've ordered items like the Factory Burger($12.95)that were to DIE for and some items like the Cuban sandwich($13.95) that were terribly disgusting. Nonetheless, I keep coming back for more. 

The portions here could feed 3 people, no joke. The prices are high because of the enormously insane portion sizes. (Not as big as Hash House A Go-Go but still huge) 

My favorite item thus far: the Eggplant Parmesan!!! ($15.50)The flavor is fantastic. The marinara sauce and fontina cheese that's layered  on the crisp eggplant \"lasagna style\" is wonderful. It's not too salty which is a plus. The pesto pasta doesn't overpower the dish itself either. 

Eva, the cashier at the bakery counter is such a sweetheart! She's always super helpful with special requests and additional sauces if needed. AND she's always smiling! 

Overall, you CAN go wrong at this place but with my help....that won't happen!!"}
{"text":"Tia,  the hostess,  took my name for a party of 2 with nobody ahead of us. My mom politely asked for a booth.  I saw a party of 3, 5, then 6 get seated before us.  Finally one of several the girls seating everyone asked about why my mom and I were not seated.  Tia said she didn't know. The girl proceeded to seat us and apologized.  I told her that I was wondering why so many groups went before us.  Food was great.... We didn't complain, but Tia sure needs customer service skills training."}
{"text":"The customer service is terrible in this location. I came with my uncle and our server was rude. The food was just ok. I love cheesecake factory but I guess not this location"}
{"text":"Had a sad experience there this past weekend.  Normally I would give it a 4 star review for the fresh strawberry martini, chicken chopped salad , pizettes, Jamaican Shrimp and of course the cheesecake.  However, this last experience was bordering on nightmarish there.  Overpacked as usual on a weekend, we took first available seating which was outside.  A litte chilly, but ok.  The table was slanted on an angle which made things interesting and not in a good way.  Then the heater went out.  We were then gassed by 3 different people trying to light it to no avail, even after we asked them to stop trying as the gas smell was so bad.  They refused to stop and literally left a huge stench of gas which turned our stomachs the rest of the time we were there and the non-working heater also left us in pretty much dark and cold.  
We ordered and the appetizer never came until the meals did which took quite a long time.  10 minutes after ordering, the waiter came back to say the item our friend ordered was out and she had to pick something else.  She said \"please give me a minute\" and he stood there.  She said it again, \"I'm going to need a minute \"and he finally went oh, and backed off from looming over her then took quite a while to return.  
When meals did arrive, one did not come until 10 minutes after the rest.  My salad had mystery ingredients in it in addition to the normal ingredients (5 black beans and some stuff I had no idea what it was in the dim light).  It tasted funny and the waiter never asked why there were oddities lined up on the side of the bowl or why I did not come close to finishing it.   
It was not a stellar night for the staff  or food that evening!"}
{"text":"Would never think but they have some of the best burgers ever!!! The menu is insane and there is something for everyone, i seem to always get a burger. I just tried the celebration cheesecake and I craved it for days after, yes that good...."}
{"text":"This review isn't about the Cheesecake Factory themselves but a props to their happy hour. We all know Cheesecake Factory... big portions. An extensive menu. Stark white shirts that I have no clue how every server keeps them bright white all shift. But have you ever been by for happy hour?! Best in Charlotte. Hands down. 

Post up at the bar (HH only at the bar) and grab a menu. About a dozen different options, all from the Cheesecake Factory's regular appetizer menu all for $5 each. Chris and I decided to get the tex mex eggrolls and the buffalo blasts. They delivered the dishes and damnnn... full-sized plates. And if you've ever been to CCF you know how much food that is - and for $5! I couldn't believe it wasn't smaller HH portions!

The buffalo blasts were piled high - 8 to the plate. And is a crispy, fluffy, deep fried pocket. Bite in and it is filed with juicy grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. And as a huge lover of all things spicy, I was in love. I recommend with sour cream. Awesome cooling effect to the buffalo. We ended up eating 3 of the blasts and 4 out of the 6 eggrolls. Packed a to-go box and left highly satisfied. 

Only downside, I work in Uptown and the happy hour here goes from 4 to 6pm. To get to South Park after work is always a challenge so if I have my heart set on some buffalo blasts, need to slip out a bit early. And you must sit at the bar. Which consists of 10 seats. Not always the easiest seat in the house to get!"}
{"text":"I feel like Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants you either love or you hate. I love it. Their menu is super extensive and it's fantastic that they offer a \"Skinnylicious\" menu for people like me who don't want to eat a 3,000 calories meal followed by a 1,200 slice of cheesecake. Their wine by the glass list is laughable, but their full bar makes up for it. My favorite thing to eat is the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio (very sushi-like) and, of course, the cheesecake. Service is always really good (we typically sit at the bar) and fast and any special requests are respected without question (e.g. sauce on the side) or complaint. Despite being a massive restaurant, it is usually packed to the gills with diners, but they turn tables quickly enough that as long as you don't have a large party, wait times are kept to minimum. They will also validate your parking (2 hours) for any of the Southside Works garages. If Cheesecake Factory wants a 5th star, they need to bring back the White Chocolate Blueberry cheesecake (why they discontinued my favorite cheesecake in the first place is beyond me)."}
{"text":"We returned with a friend from out of town. The service was great, food arrived quickly and fresh. I will go back."}
{"text":"I finally got to check out the Cheesecake Factory last weekend. We got there at about 11 am and the wait wasn't too bad - 30 minutes. If it was any longer, I wouldn't have waited. 

The actual restaurant is quite bright and big and very similar to what it looks like in the US locations. 

I ordered off the brunch menu, which is only available on Saturdays and Sundays.  I ordered the fried chicken and waffles which turned out to be quite yummy. I enjoyed the
combination of the sweet maple butter syrup and waffles and the savoury breaded fried chicken and poached eggs. Everything was cooked the way that it should be and was thoroughly enjoyed. I was worried that the Toronto location would not be the same as the US locations - but everything was comparable. 

I was so full that I had to order a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake to go. That too was very yummy. 

Overall, I had a positive experience at the Cheesecake Factory and I look forward to returning and trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Love this location because:

1.  you are footsteps away from some great shopping
2.  you can stare at the aquarium while you eat al fresca (but really not outside)
3.  they used to have the Gods show but I don't know if it's their anymore
4.  YOU ARE IN VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Amazing hospitality from the entire staff. From the hosts to the bussers everyone made our experience wonderful. Even the manager stopped by to check on us. Can't say enough nice things about this place. Save room for cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised. I've been to a bunch of CFs across the US and would generally rate them 3 - 4 stars. This one was significantly more vibrant, with friendlier staff, cleaner tables, and despite a huge lineup, short wait times for food. Perhaps that will all wear off as the place gets older, but for now, this one's a must.

The only thing that sucks is their pricing. I guess that's the reality of the current USD/CAD situation."}
{"text":"Went on a late datenight and waitress gave me ore attitude than a hungry 5 year old. I understand that she might have had a long day but honey you are in customer service if you are not up for it take time off not give attitude to people who pay for your paycheck. Food was amazing as always"}
{"text":"Came here with my family and we were seated outside. After about 10 minutes my brother approached a waiter and he came by and said he's not our waiter but took our order for drinks and appetizers. His name was Raven. Our waitress eventually came by but she was not as nice and attentive as Raven. Throughout the dinner he came by making sure we were taken care of.  He was amazing! 

My brother and I ordered the steak Diane and the other two people in our party ordered vegetarian burgers. We also had the ahi tuna tartar and avocado egg rolls for appetizers. The food was very good. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place is finally here!!
I came first thing on a Saturday morning and did not have to wait in line at all. I got a buzzer and once it opened, we got our table right away.
They have a huge menu (which usually isn't a great thing) but in this case, the only downside was trying to decide what the heck to eat, because everything looked soooo good. They have a great breakfast/brunch menu, and I finally got to try chicken & waffles for the first time ever. I got the eggs Benedict on the side (another food I've never tried) but wound up not even having enough room to finish them. The chicken & waffles were SUPERB and such an awesome combo that I'm shocked I haven't gotten around to trying them before now. The side potatoes were pretty tasty as well! My friends got the cinnamon roll pancakes and brioche French toast... those pancakes were the fluffiest I've ever seen! Topped it all off by getting the Oreo Dream extreme cheesecake to go (I seriously had no room left).
After reading some negative reviews of this place, I wasn't sure what to really expect, but this place came through big time. Yes, it's pricey, and yes, if I had to wait 3.5hrs then I might not have felt as positive...but I had a wonderful experience and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It's been a little while since I was here. I always liked to sit in the little room off to the side-it's quieter. Service was always ok. I always got my favorite,the Chicken Madeira,and it was really good and satisfying. My friend had a Cuban sandwich and really liked it. Of course,you can't leave there without trying the many varieties of cheesecake.  Everything we've tried has been really good,but my favorite ones are always the chocolate ones- godiva,chocolate tuxedo,and chocolate mousse. They have a lot of choices in appetizers,entrees,and desserts. They even carry low carb cheesecake."}
{"text":"Besides the ludicrous decor, I enjoyed eating here. Even with the Eye of Sauron watching me."}
{"text":"We stumbled across the Cheesecake Factory amongst the general madness of the Caesar Forum shops and were very quickly seated as the rest of the line were larger groups than our two. The server was really friendly helpful and gave good tips on what to see and do in Las Vegas.

I'm impressed that there were so many choices on the menu, it must be a logistical nightmare to maintain. I ordered pasta and meat sauce which was huge but as I was starving the whole lot was polished off quickly. Sadly this left no room for dessert."}
{"text":"I would give this Cheescake Factory location a better review if they had handled our large group a little better.  They don't take reservations and we had a party of 13.  They gave us the runaround for at least 1.5hrs regarding when we'd be seated.  We tried to kill time in the mall but it truly was a painful wait.  It was moderately frustrating to watch people show up, eat a meal and leave.

Aside from this, everything else was great.  The Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad is massive and I had second meal with my leftovers.  The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake is tart and delicious.  I wasn't expecting the crust to include coconut.  I do think they add waaaay too much whipped cream to the plate.  Most people who had desert hardly touched it and it seems like a huge waste.     

Our server was friendly and swift.  I don't know if this is normal because they may have been kissing our butt due to the seating issue.  Either way, the experience once we sat down was lovely and I'd definitely return, with a much smaller group this time.  I wouldn't go back with a party larger than 4 or 6."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here ever since my high school days.. Love the ambiance love the food.. service is ok.. sometimes they have the tendency to neglect your table if they get to busy..

For starters i would order the spinach and artichoke dip

for drinks order their starwberry lemonade

Then for the entrees I would order the Herb crusted salmon salad if your feeling healthy or the KObe Beef is rediculuosly delicious..  

For dessert i usually end it with a traditional starwberry cheescake if it wont fit take it to go and save it for later for a midnight snack..

Prices are about average sometimes a bit pricey but well worth it!

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pasta to go for my niece. It was seriously so delicious. We got the tomato basil pasta. We got to watch the statue show while waiting for our order, so that was fun. (: They were also kind enough to give us some extra utensils and another take out container so we could share. 

It came with bread and butter, but the bread was hardened, so not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Upon arriving to Yorkdale mall, we had to wait a dreaded 2.5 hours which, surprisingly, went by very quickly as having friends can help pass time so I would highly recommend having friends, bringing 1, or make some while you're there. There are two lines u have to wait through and then you get in. After walking inside, the atmosphere felt very vivid and exclusive as the restaurant had an exquisite feel to it. Finally sitting down, man oh man, the seats were so terrific! felt like chairs from Cuba or some exotic place like that. Bringing the bread out as a starter, the first one was dry, old, and stale like my stats prof, however the second one was rich in flavour and blended well with the butter. The pasta we ordered with the chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes was $23.95 and definitely worth it as the portion size is bigger then my forehead and is suited for 2. The strawberry cheesecake, gurl don't even get me started on that, that shit was bomb.com, it was heavenly as  tears came out of my fat little face with each bite, unfortunately I had to share with my gf so don't make that mistake when u go in but it's ok u win some u lose some u know? But yea I give the Cheesecake Factory a solid 9 cheesecakes out of 10 cheesecakes and would go back next time and not share my food cause that shit good yo."}
{"text":"Still good food but when you want to get a banana cheese cake you also get rotten bananas. I love balut but this is gross for Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"The food was great, and you can hear the show happening over the aquarium near by. The waiter seemed to have quite a few tables, but still did a good job of checking on our table of 7. Everyone was happy with their food, and unhappy with their desserts. Too sweet overall. Oh well. 
My only problem was that they overcharged my card, though I'm hoping it's fixed soon. Overall I recommend this location.  The shepherds pie and crab cake bites were tasty."}
{"text":"When your menu is 30 pages long (okay, I tend to exaggerate) and filled with Italian, Asian, Mexican, American and so on food choices, you just start to wonder just how good the food's going to be.
I think this is exactly the Cheesecake Factory's problem.  With such an extensive menu that offers food from every ethnic group, it's no wonder that they're unable to excel in anything.  I just think they tried too hard to appease everyone instead of focusing one on or two ethnic food groups and ended up with food that is just okay.
I wouldn't say that I've had a bad meal here, but I wouldn't say it was good either.
The cheesecake on the other hand, is amazing.  They have a huge list, from snickers and reeses to caramel and pumpkin- and they're all equal in their deliciousness.  
My advice: Skip dinner and have either apps and dessert or dessert only."}
{"text":"Big fan of the Cheesecake Factory
 Love their Sheppard's Pie and tex Mex egg rolls, but honestly, I've never had anything but great food there. Will definitely be there again!"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner tonight with my wife. Our server David G was incredible.  His ability to read us to meet our needs is a 5 star. I just returned from NY last night and wanted to spend an evening out with my wife. 
Kudos David G and the dessert after our dinner, wow, lemon meringue was a great suggestion."}
{"text":"To Whom It May Concern:

On a day trip to Madison, my family and I decided to give your restaurant a chance.  Upon walking in from a day of shopping, we noticed the ambiance, wonderful lighting, seating area, comfortable temperature, and what appeared to be the start of a great experience.  The experience we foresaw, was not what we received with the quality of the food/drinks.  We began by ordering a signature $10.50 Mimosa and a Summer Shandy to enjoy on a hot spring Memorial Day.  Memorial, the experience was, but for the wrong reasons.  The drink my fiance ordered was disturbingly nauseating right from the beginning.  We quickly flagged down someone of the staff (not our waitress) and explained that the taste was unappetizing and quickly requested a white wine beverage, which we were immediately deterred from getting.  In turn, (our non server) mentioned there was too much Almond Syrup in the previous concoction.  My fiance agreed to try it again.  To her dismay, the beverage still had a funky taste to it, which was disheartening.  Upon leaving a full beverage behind after we were told that it would be removed from our bill, it was not.  Also, I had ordered fish tacos for my meal.  The fish was requested grilled.  Other than the ends and bottom portions of the fish being charred beyond my teethes ability to chew, I too, could not finish my meal.  My daughters Chicken Quesadilla was perfect and edible.  My fiances chicken tacos were mediocre, there was an abundance of cilantro on the rice, which made it difficult for her to eat.  As we decided to get ready to leave, my fiance decided to order some cheesecake and a piece of chocolate cake, as we sat right next to the desert bar, we simply couldn't resist.  Upon leaving we were faced with our final straw at the \"Cheesecake Factory\".  We found a brown (not blonde as my fiance's) hair intertwined in the chocolate cake.  This is my fiances second visit to a Cheesecake Factory and it was my first and our last visit.

With a whopping $80 bill, I made sure to tip our server (who was not around for most of the serving) $12.00 to ensure she was at least taken care of for her troubles.  

Thank you,"}
{"text":"Any place that has \"cheesecake\" in it's name is a gold sticker in my book.

But really, this place is awesome. Of all the multiple times I've been here, there have only been a few times where the wait is kinda long, and it will be for you too, especially if you're there during the early evenings or/and the weekends.

Me and my friends typically make our way to this place around 9 or so, about an hour before it closes and the place is usually not that crowded, or winding down. We seem to typically get our food faster this way.

But screw the food, we all know I come here for the cheesecake. I've had the red velvet, the chocolate godiva, the tiramisu, and jacked some banana creme from my friends plate. No not in one sitting you asshole, over multiple visits! I've never had any complaints. It's so delicious that even if I'm too full after a meal, I'll still take cheesecake to go. Chocolate Godiva cheesecake is the cheesecake of gods and it descended from the heavens into this restaurant and if you don't eat it, you're wrong. Forshame!

The food can be hit or miss. Typically their Asian cuisine is pretty spot on. It may not be authentic, but it sure is tasty. I think the only bad thing I've ever really had here is the chicken and biscuits. It's like, swimming in gravy, and I hate soup. Their veggie burger is kinda sad too, just fell apart in my hands. Steak is definitely the way to go.

The alcoholic drinks are good game too. While a bit pricey, I can slurp down 4 of those orangy-fruity things before the meal gets there."}
{"text":"Love the food here, love the cheesecake. If I could live here and eat cheesecake all my life, I would. Don't judge.

I've been here multiple times and have tried quite a few things on their extensive menu, and I don't have any complaints. I usually pick the same cheesecake when I come here but I've had the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake, the Red Velvet, and the Caramel one. All are awesome.

I know this place gets busy but sometimes the service is lacking. The other day I went with my friend here for lunch and there were two empty, dirty tables next to us that took over a half an hour to get bussed, Ew. Come on guys, it wasn't even busy during that time."}
{"text":"I didn't get to try the food but this is for the wait time. Yes I know we have to wait a while but this was ridiculous! I went with 2 friends yesterday around 5:30. We got the buzzer and they said it was a 40 min wait. We then went inside and they said it would be a 15-20 min wait 3 times. At 7 pm we were so hungry, we left and went to Pickle Barrell. Is it worth the wait? I don't think so. The menu is the same as Jack Astors, Pickle Barrell and East Side Marios combined. If you really want the cheesecake, just get it to go. 

I was starving and almost fainted twice as I was so hungry. Someone should sue them for their wait times. But I guess they won't give a shit because all they care about is money and filling the tables. 

The hostesses had the same reason - \"oh we have 10-15 tables clearning but some paid the bills and some ordered dessert. We can't force them to leave. Thanks for understanding\". I had to listen to this 3 times. 

Really???????

I would wait for a Michelin star restaurant but not for the Cheesecake Factory. If you don't mind waiting 2-3 hours even if they tell you it is only 40 mins, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 10/100***

I've always been a fan of this place for those occasional calorie indulgence. We had family stay at Caesar's so we decided to dine in house. With reservations made ahead of time, everything was smooth sailing. I like that this location is quite large and that there are 2 floors of seating, although it can get pretty packed on the weekends and around dinner time. The menu is extensive so ordering is a task in itself lol. Somehow though, I always revert to my favorite Miso salmon, brown rice in lieu of white. Hubby got the Mac and Cheese burger which was cooked perfectly, rich and flavorsome. The madre got the Louisiana Chicken pasta which she thoroughly enjoyed. We also had a taste of the fish tacos which were surprisingly good, the cilantro rice is one of the best I've tried. On the kids menu: chicken tenders and fries, well it's chicken tenders and fries, nothing much to elaborate. The mac and cheese that my son ordered was unsavory to put it mildly. It was dry and bland with no flavor profile at all. Our server must've noticed my sons dislike as he took one bite and ceased eating altogether hahaha so he offered to get him something else, my son wasn't feeling very well so he opted for the bread basket instead. Our server informed us he would have the mac and cheese taken out of the bill, we told him it wasn't necessary but he insisted. A red velvet cheesecake was shared amongst us as we were too stuffed to order more. Service was cordial and timely despite the dinner rush. When the bill came and noticed the mac and cheese was not taken out, he gladly rectified the situation which in turn we added to his tip as we appreciated the effort and kind gesture."}
{"text":"We ordered for the chicken potstickers and flat bread for the appetizers and they were really good . Their bread basket has some of the best samplers around ! They have huge portions of everything and the menu in itself is like a booklet with whole lot of selections . Linda's cream cake and the lemon meringue cheesecake for deserts were divine ! With such good food and ambience the price has all the reasons to be on the higher side . Hello .. Whose complaining !!"}
{"text":"we had the worse experience there the waitress was the worse she was a very heavy woman young and she made it seem if i wanted something it was a annoyance for her--i ordered a pasta dish with shrimp and the shrimp was good but the plain pasta was so dry and i wanted some sauce on it and she never came back to ask me if everything was ok--it was my birthday lunch with my husband and it was a big dissapointment---"}
{"text":"I don't know what to think about this house. I remember reading in Mens Health that this restaurant serves up a heavy portion, high caloric fatty foods. But the cheesecake on the marquee drew me in. I was dining with my daughter and have a tendency to try to fatten up my kids, to no avail and to be fair there is a SkinnyLicious Menu.

I ordered up the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Shrimp and chicken sauteed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy Cajun sauce on top of fresh linguine. $17. Certainly a heavy plate, delicious and took home half of it for someone else in the family. My drink was a Stella Artois 22 oz. $7.25 The kid got a marinara pasta. $11.50

We came for the cheesecake. Kahlua cocoa coffee $7. and the fresh strawberry  $7.50. I ate half of mine. It was so good."}

{"text":"Five stars for this place, weighs more than my other five-star reviews.
It's inside a specific casino that I avoid like the plague, so for me to eat there, means that it's a nice place.
The menu is like a phone book, like all Cheesecake Factories, but that never intimidates me.
The atmosphere is very nice and laid back, which is refreshing.
The place is actually located at the very end of the Forum Shops, so it's the furthest distance from the casino floor, which is good all around.
The service is great.
I've never gone there with a party of less than 8 people, and my water glass has never been empty for more than a couple of minutes.
The food is very good, and its presentation is terrific.
But, the real surprise is the price. Very reasonable for any Strip restaurant, let alone one that's inside a big name casino. 
I only wish that they had a back door so that I wouldn't have to walk through the casino."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in a long time. Went there with friends for dessert after a movie. I had the 30th anniversary cheesecake which was really good, big portion that I was able to share with one of my friends. The service was good. The only complaint would be that it was very noisy from music playing from speakers in the ceiling. The server got part of our order wrong because he couldn't hear us unless we shouted."}
{"text":"Recently took my family here for dinner on a Tuesday night. Horrible experience overall. First, the silverware was filthy. I mean, one spoon was literally covered in hardened food. It was disgusting. I pointed it out to a manager and she didn't even apologize. She just took the spoon and we never heard from her again. She didn't even bring us a replacement spoon!!
The service was slow and they screwed up our order. It shouldn't be that hard to serve four people correctly.
I know a lot of people love the Cheesecake Factory, but the management at this specific location really lacks. Pathetic service and just a general terrible experience."}
{"text":"Totally blown away by the amazing customer service our extremely large party of 25 received from David L. and Dante W. They were spot on with the orders, extremely friendly and professional. They totally rocked as a team and made our dinner go by flawlessly. Well done!"}
{"text":"Considering earlier positive experiences, I was gravely disappointed. 

First off, you claim you have a full bar, yet you couldn't make a blood and sand. Then when I asked the waitress for a sazarac, she replied that she had no idea what that was before even consulting with the bar. When she did talk to them, they had o idea what it was either. Come onnnnn, thats America's first cocktail. Standard drink. I'm female and fresh out if college, and even I know what it is. A good bartender would've looked it up on their phone or have had a cocktail book stored at their register. After the huge ordeal, I succumbed to the firefly martini... It had tequila so I was good... For the time being...

My mom had specifically ordered a medium burger. Not only was her burger late coming to the table, it was also a brick. When we told the waitress, she looked so annoyed with us, grabbed the burger plus my mom's fries, without asking. The very insincere manager came over to tell us he took it off the bill, and offered to grab us something else. Anywhere else would've comped the burger and whatever else we ordered for her wait.

My fish and chips were decent...  Not mind blowing. 

Extreme oreo cheesecake was far too sweet. Considering all the mishaps and the fact it was my mom's birthday, we would've appreciated a comp'ed cheesecake... But I guess the big bad corporate cheesecake factor is far too big for some good old fashioned service... Or at the very least, a happy birthday."}
{"text":"This is the third year that I celebrated my birthday at Cheesecake Factory. (twice in Chandler Mall which is a 5 Star service)Our server for the night was JENNA. I believe that as a server you need to pay attention to what you do. She just toss the glass of water and didn't leave any straw. 
We ordered Vietnamese Eggs Rolls and a Thai Lettuce wraps which is very good. After we finish our food, we were waiting...and waiting for our server to come over. One of the server indeed inform us that she is probably busy in another section so we did not bother. It's just so strange that we didn't see our server at all only at that time that she appeared all of a sudden and ask for our dessert.
Told her it was my birthday and I want a pineapple upside down and a pinacolada cheesecake. She came back with a plate marked \"Happy Birthday Michael\" but it was not the cheesecake for me. It's for my wife. I ordered pineapple upside down! I think our server that night had a bad night. She is not paying much attention and sort of missing most of the time. I think that probably the restaurant is under staff. Too many sections assigned to be covered by this server that's why we can not have an excellent service just like the other branch in Chandler Mall. Management should make sure that every server is give an adequate task and area of responsibility because in the end the whole business is the one's affected. Thank you singing me a happy birthday song that night."}
{"text":"I haven't had the cheesecake factory in the states so i can't compare the quality but here is my experiences. The wait line of course is horrible for a Tuesday (1hr 20 mins) after 1pm so i do really recommend everyone to wait until the hype die down a bit before making a visit. 
Appetizers we picked tuna tartare and crab cake bites. Both portion were actually smaller than we thought but it did fill up. 
The tuna tartare has a balanced flavours of soy and ginger, the avocado chunk at the base separately from the fish make the dish presentable. The chips were a bit too oily. 
The crab cake bites came with 6 pieces, mayo and lemon wedge on the side. I Expected it to be more crunchy.  theres a decent amount of crab in the little bites which is worth it. 
Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken came in huge portion with a mixed of regular pasta and spinach pasta. I like my pasta more al dente tho. Pasta wasn't rinse thoroughly so it was clumped a bit. Sauce was well seasoned, no complaints. 
Almond crusted salmon salad served with kale, quinoa, dried cranberry and dressed in light sweetened balsamic. Salmon skin is crispy and the crusted is not too heavy which makes the dish overall not bad 
Tiramisu cheesecake is amazing. The cheesecake part is not dense, more of a mouse texture which makes it light and not so rich to indulge the whole thing. Base is sponge(lady finger) cake soaked w coffee or kahlua just like a regular tiramisu, two of my fave desserts combine into one make so much sense, i do enjoy it !"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, the food is delicious, the staff is wonderful, a but slow of service due to it being busy, but totally worth the wait. The cheesecake is out of this world! Today I ordered the chicken littles... Yumm!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory always exceeds expectations!

We have always had attentive, accommodating, and friendly wait staff. Their menu is endless which allows you to always come back and try something new (it is hard though because you always want to order the amazing entree you got last time).

Most recently our visit included several dishes. To start we got the Chicken Pot Stickers as an appetizer. The sauce was wonderful, the chicken was flavorful and moist, and I only wish they served 6 pieces instead of 5 so we could have shared them more easily. Among the appetizers we have tried in the past, the Stuffed Mushrooms are a must, Fried Zucchini is great, and the Ahi Tartare is decent (a little small on the portion size). We have also tried the Vietnamese Tacos. The spices and seasonings were perfect, but the bread-to-meat ratio was a little more on the bread side, but the flavor still did not disappoint.

Among our entrees, the one that stood out on our most recent visit was the Hibachi Steak. Wow, honestly when we go back it will be hard for me to get anything else. I thought the steak might be whole, but it was chopped and cooked with a hibachi type sauce (sweet and savory). The meat was not dried out, not fatty, and oh-so tasty. The wasabi mashed potatoes were amazing; they weren't too creamy, and the wasabi taste was not overwhelming and complemented everything else nicely. The two pieces of tempura asparagus served on top were cooked to perfection. The tempura batter was light, tasted perfect, and they had a crisp texture and the asparagus was not over or under cooked on the inside. Definitely one of my favorite meals here.

I always order a side of plantains when I come here. I first experienced these when I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp (which is soooo good with the mango salsa, black beans, and seasonings). Ever since that dish I make sure to get some plantains with our meal.

Among the entrees, from what I can remember, we have tried, and loved a couple of the burgers, the Southeast Asian Caramel Chicken, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp, Pasta Carbonara, Simple Grilled Chicken, a side of Sweet Potato Fries (anything sweet potato is great), and much more.

Everything is made fresh, and they can alter the dishes upon request. If you have an allergy or concern with ingredients, just ask! They can do many substitutions and are able to cook the food differently if you require.

Oh my the cheesecakes!!! Pumpkin, Peppermint (both are special editions, but probably the best), Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple, Dulce De Leche Caramel, Kahlua Cocoa Coffee, Pineapple Upside-Down (amazing), Pina Colada, Mango Key Lime, and the new Oreo Dream Extreme (very chocolaty).  I haven't ordered all of these myself, but over the years I have at least tried these (whether it is me or someone I am with who has ordered them), and they are all amazing.

Wouldn't recommend to indulge all the time, but for special occasions once or twice a year... go for it!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere nice art work waitress was on point seated quickly l would go again for hamburger and fries other items were calorie great.  Very busy on week end."}
{"text":"Only concern was the soda glass my daughter got was broken around the rim, quite dangerous! Our server immediately apologize and brought her a fresh soda. Love the \"skinny menu\" the skinny margarita was very good and under 150 calories!!! Edamame needed some salt they were rather bland. My two 14yr old girls had glam burgers and they were HUGE they could have split one. Very juicy very tasty! Now time for the snickers and dream extreme cheesecake!! I will just be drinking water!! Gotta get in shape!!! Angelica our server was very pleasant and on the ball. I listened to her talk to her tables around us and she was genuinely kind and made sure everyone was enjoying their meals. Sweet girl."}
{"text":"We had gone in to get their tiramisu CAKE. They don't sell a whole cake only by tray and it's too much for only two people so we went in and asked for two slices at the front bakery and a soda. Well we live in California and we were on our way home when we realized that they had given us cheesecake not cake. I called and asked for a manager and Andrew is a \"manager\" and told me he couldn't do anything about it because it had been over an hour? Uhm HELLO!!!! It's VEGAS! Whether I lived in California or not what does the time matter?! You're telling a customer they can't go back and return something they didn't ask for?! At least exchange it. The employees really do need to pay attention to what customers are asking for. This is a tourist city and your restaurant is in a tourist area!!!!!! Pay attention for what people ask for! Not everyone has the chance to eat here all the time or to be wasting money on something they don't want just because you can't pay attention and your lousy manager can't fix your mistakes! Will never come back here again. I have family in Vegas so I'm always coming down here and they said they've always had a problem with this specific facility whether it's service or food not being prepared right or cold. It's something wrong. Even though this is the closest one to their home they'd rather drive farther just to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Waited 1.5 hours when was told $20. Food also took way longer than expected. When brought to manager's attention they said we only waited 5 minutes and wouldn't believe us."}
{"text":"This has always been a fav place of ours. My mom loves this place and my girls grew up with this place. I grew up  eating at cheesecake factory in Brentwood. That's where my grandmother would take me so it's natural for us to love this place!"}
{"text":"Ive probably been here more than 30 times. Been coming here probably for 8 years. Best cheesecake factory in Las Vegas. I never have an issue with customer service, the waiters or the management here. food portions are HUGEEEE. It's definitely filling. Must try the cheesecakes. My favorite dish from cheesecake factory is \"Louisiana chicken pasta\" very authentic taste.  I love the Godiva chocolate cheesecake from here. Great place great atmosphere great customer service great food. Overall awesome."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate her belated birthday. I asked our server nicely if he could put a candle on her cake, and he did not only put a candle on her cake, but they also turned her plate into a birthday plate, and had 5 servers sing Happy Birthday to her, which was super sweet. 
We had the salty caramel cheesecake and chocolate mousse cheesecake. They were delicious! (The only bad thing about them is that it's just too much cake, cause let's face it - nobody needs 900 calories worth of cheesecake.) ;) We ate about half of it, and our server put the rest in boxes for us so we could bring it home. 

All in all we had a really good birthday celebration, and looooved those cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"To start off, i must say i am a HUGE fan of the cheesecake factory and by that, I mean I used to make a trip down to buffalo just to grab dinner, and i could never imagine having a negative experience with them. Knowing that i no longer had to make such a long drive, i was so excited for them to be opened at Yorkdale. So I decided to celebrate my birthday here this year. I called to double check if i could make reservations, and if they have anything for birthdays, and they said they do complimentary cheesecake. Not that i was expecting a full size cheesecake. But i learned from my server its not, they do a mini sundae, which is not what i was offered on the phone but cool. Best part? My server never even brought it. 

I was the first to be seated in the section. But my server showed up last which means when the table beside us were enjoying appetizers, my water just got served. I wasnt in a rush so whatever, waited an hour in line for this, might as well enjoy the time here. Studied the menu during the hour wait and was all set to order: Ahi tartare, pasta carbonara with chicken and two steak diane and salmon combo. Happily anticipating. Then my server came back with bad news saying theyre out of steak diane. Only new york steak, habichi, and rib eye available. Ok fine, ill take the new york steak and the miso salmon to share. Then he came back AGAIN and said theyre out of that too. By that time i was beyond disappointed. You know what fine, ill settle for the rib eye then. Not what i wanted but will do. Shortly after, im guessing my server was too embarrassed to come back and tell me, so he sent another server to come tell me the ahi tartare was also NOT AVAILABLE. Deep down yelling WTF and wanted to cry at this point. 3 out of the 4 items I ordered were not available. I find that very unacceptable. I came at 7pm, got seated at 8pm, 3 more hours until closing and lots of customers still waiting outside, I was so ready to walk out of there. Definitely need to manage their food supplies better especially on a weekend. My server came back and said hes gna ask the manager to stop by. Im like sure, lets see if you can make things right. Manager came, didnt wish me happy birthday or anything and straight up just told me that the tuna shipment this morning was bad and he tried his best to savage it but couldnt. Okay? Thanks for the tuna shipment analysis? If u knew since this morning then maybe you shouldve notified all your servers and me BEFORE i ordered. Not 25 minutes after my order was in. Im not running this business with you, i dont need a report of your tuna shipments. I really just want my food. And that was it. Off he went.... useless conversation. Horrible job at comforting customers let alone making things right or making an extravagant birthday experience. Mood killed. Could barely enjoy my dinner. Server finally came back to check on us, i guess he totally forgot its my birthday and never brought me that mini sundae. And there, we heard a group of staff a few tables down singing happy birthday. Thank you for making me feel EXTRA not special, neglected and unimportant as a customer. Just wanted to grab the bill and leave! Didnt even ask for the dessert menu, and for those who eat with me know i alwys go for dessert! Who comes to the cheesecake factory and leaves without cheesecake?  

Im sure everyone is familiar with the overwhelming menu, large portions, and variety of cheesecakes. Hence, why its one of my favourite places to visit. But i regret making the choice to celebrate my birthday here last night. Literally THE WORST AND MOST DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE ever. 

And if ure still wondering what i end up eating:
Pasta carbonara with chicken
Rib eye steak 
Miso salmon

Food was still okay. But this location is officially blacklisted."}
{"text":"We've experienced Cheesecake Factory in Milwaukee so knew going in what to expect. Large chain feel, extra large portions, etc.

Hubby and I stopped in for lunch on a whim when we were out shopping at West Towne. Shared the Chicken salad sandwich and fries. Each table also gets bread and butter. Sandwich was good, fries were fresh/hot. We left satisfied, and skipped the dessert."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory USED to be my favorite restaurant. Until yesterday. I went to the Peoria, AZ location with my husband and two kids in the early afternoon. The restaurant was not very busy but our waiter was horrible. We have a one year old and asked for a high chair. He didn't bring it so I had to ask the manager for one. He seemed annoyed at me for asking. Finally like 5 minutes later a hostess brought me the high chair. The waiter came to our table and offered us waters and bread. He also offered the baby bananas (she never received the bananas). He never formally took a drink order. Like 15 minutes later he took our food order. My son wanted a chocolate milk to drink. He didn't get the chocolate milk until after we were done eating. My food came out cold but the plate was scorching (microwaved obviously). I told the waiter and he made my order \"fresh\". After all this I wasn't very hungry so I just got my food to go. My husband and son both received cold food as well. I would expect this from somewhere cheap but I mean come on. We spent over $60 on our lunch. At least it could have been hot. NEVER going back there."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant...yet another great meal and excellent service...I did take off a star for the price as I do feel as though they are a little to pricey for what they offer...if was $108 for two people for a small steak and steamed vegetables and desert...
Also, they were not packed, no waiting and they crammed us in a small two person table right next to another table full of people. I feel like they could have spread us out a bit...
But overall very pleased and will definitely return next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The wait staff was too busy. We didn't get the attention we needed. She was stopped we 3 times before she could get back to our table to get our dessert order.  We drove all the way up from Columbia for my daughter's birthday dinner and was slightly disappointed. The portions were smaller than I remember. The bathrooms were filthy and the display case for the cheesecakes was nasty. I was disappointed. It has been a year since our last visit and the trip was a total waste of drive time and money."}
{"text":"My first time going here...First and last! I was not impressed. I didn't want to send my plate back, but it was not good. The Steak Diane had 3 small pieces of steak that was cold about a fork full of caramelized onions and 2 mushrooms with very little sauce. I get that it was a combination plate hence the extra small portion. The Herb Crusted salmon was dry and a little burnt. I don't like to send food back, especially when it takes almost an hour to get food! I also fear that someone may spit on my food. The dessert and service were decent. For the price, the meal was lacking."}
{"text":"The basic Cheesecake Factory in a mall. Busy, loud and takes awhile to get your food. The food is the same as most locations and our waitress was kind."}
{"text":"Always enjoy dining at Cheesecake Factory whether it's for dinner or lunch. Lunch this time and as always they didn't disappoint. Prompt and consistent service throughout meal by friendly server Cole. Didn't feel rushed at all and perfect amount of attention. Had Sheila's salad and the Cobb salad. Both delicious although the lunch portions seemed a bit smaller this go around. Just as well as we had to save room for Cheesecake right?! Yyyyaaaasssss! Shared Chris' outrageous cheesecake which is a dynamite German chocolate cake cheesecake concoction. That and banana cream are my faves. Other food faves include fish and chips, Louisiana pasta, any and all of the salads, and the chicken parm sandwich. Have never had bad or even mediocre meal here. The difficult part is choosing from the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"You can never really go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. Always good food. It can get a bit loud and crowded, but I'm willing to put up with that for and hour for a great meal."}
{"text":"Always, no matter what Cheesecake Factory I go, FABULOUS!  If you like crowds, it's not for you. I love the noise, atmosphere, the energy of the place, people, bartenders, all of it. Today's food was great. Happy Hour Menu, Buffalo Blast- Excellent & Artichoke Spinach Dip-Excellent!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is not normally on the top of my list when choosing a place to dine in Vegas. I find the menu to be slightly overpriced, way too extensive, and have never had \"amazing\" service there.
But, the family insisted on it for lunch today, and I'm glad they did.
I had the Luau Salad, and the waiter recommended I get the full size, as opposed to the lunch size, if I was hungry. I did, and it was a nice size salad with mango, wontons, carrots, some other stuff & DELICIOUS chicken.
Marty was a great server as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I know we will always get a wonderful meal here. The bread is always fresh. The salads are always made well. Love the booths and overall set-up of the dinning area. The wait is tolerable and worth it. The employees are friendly and efficient. The cheesecake is delicious but we rarely partake because of the price. Thumbs up guys, great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"stopped in for a snack before the PADRES-CUBS game across the street at the PEORIA SPORTS COMPLEX. the restaurant is huge with an over-the-top DISNEYLAND in LAS VEGAS look.

the kid's PEPPERONI PIZZA was light, crispy and surprisingly good. 

mom and dad shared the VIETNAMESE TACOS which were basically open-faced bao (steamed CHINESE buns) topped with a banh mi filling (roasted pork, cilantro, juliened cucumbers, carrots and onions in a light pickle). the seasoning was minimal (read \"bland\") and the \"sandwich\" itself a bit dry. really like the idea but the execution was weak."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of the menu that has 1000 things but I know people like it so I will keep my review unbiased. The choices are overwhelming but the one thing I'm not a fan of is you can't 'tweak' you food items. Can't add more garlic remove some key items as a lot of things are pre-packaged, in particular the sauces. About the only thing I could add was salt or pepper. Staff was good and I enjoy the variety of bread, but the wait was a killer. 

Would I return, probably of requested by someone but keep to something simple."}
{"text":"I usually order take out from here when we are not in the mood to cook dinner. The service is always great in person when picking up and also over the phone when we place our order. Food is always packed neatly and stays fresh in the Togo containers. We always get chicken samosas as an appetizer every time we order. Great place for families."}
{"text":"6/22. We came here at 4pm, seemed to be the very end of lunch but before they got busy for dinner. We were able to be seated right away, and our waiter was very nice throughout our meal. My problem mainly lies with the kitchen. They brought us our bread, which definitely was hard and stale, as if it had just been sitting for awhile. For an appetizer we ordered the chicken dumplings, which were okay but we're definitely quite dry on the inside. For our entrees, I ordered the chicken Marsala(like I always do) and my husband got a bacon burger. His burger was just fine, but my Marsala was swimming in oil, and my chicken was covered in pepper. It was just a very underwhelming experience, to say the least!"}
{"text":"I love CF, such a charming place to eat with TONS of options.  This lunch visit was no exception, met a friend and ate with our two young ones in tow (7&8).

We ordered the lunch Renee's special - 1/2 sandwich, side salad AND a cup of soup.  I loved this option and it's rare, you usually pick 2.  The cup was more like a bowl, the 1/2 sandwich was still a good size (LOVED the chicken salad with almonds) and the side salad was also pretty big.  

I love their bread basket, especially the wheat oat - yum!

The kids got nice sized portions of their meal - great options for the young ones, too.  LOVE the $1 ice cream scoop.

I love coming here and always want to come right back to try something else on their huge menu."}
{"text":"Had the mushroom glamburger and it was outrageously good 14 bucks is a little much to spend for a burger but you get what you  pay, I may order  bun on the side next time  , it was a little  wet and messy, just deconstructed  it and enjoyed  anyway"}
{"text":"I love The Cheesecake Factory. Sure, the quality is not exactly sophisticated, each entree' is worth a daily calorie intake, and the drinks are way too sugary, but boy they taste so good. The place is famous for its never ending menu, and enormous portions. It's all true, choosing an entree is hard, but you can't really go wrong here. I got the Louisiana Pasta, and it was so good. I couldn't finish my plate and since then all I can think of going back to TCF to get it again."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is a treat, since my hometown doesn't have one.  Everything ordered was cooked perfectly, and the best part was the service.  I wish we had one in Albuquerque!!"}
{"text":"The lineups are still quite long. But if you are travelling as a solo or couple one way to beat the line ups is to go straight to the bar and sit at the bar to order your food. They serve the full menu there and will take you right away (no waiting for a buzzer!) as it is first come first served. 

We got there around 10:30am on a Sunday morning. The lineup to get a buzzer was about 5 minutes, and then the wait for a table for 2 was about 50 minutes. The host offered us the bar seating which was available right away and we decided to go for it. Nobody was seated at the bar when we got there, but it did full up shortly afterwards.

The bar seating was not bad and service was immediate since the bartenders are always there. We ordered two brunch items to share. Lemon ricotta pancakes (to die for!) and green chilaquiles with carnitas (chicken) and eggs (also very tasty). Later I noticed others having the fried chicken waffles benedict and had some serious order envy. Next time for sure! 

Between the two of us we could barely finish our orders. We took home half the pancakes for later. Overall a very satisfying meal. Once we were done we quickly paid for our order and were out by 11:40, probably around the time we would have been getting our seats if we had waited with the buzzer!

After walking around the mall, on our way out we stopped at the cheesecake counter and ordered a slice to go. That again took minutes for them to get packed up for us. 

So while the food is great and portions generous, I don't think it is worth waiting for more that 1 hour for. So I will only go back if the wait is shorter (which is probably going to be a while yet) or go straight to the bar for a seat or just order takeout."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here. Every server is unique in h/er own way, yet they all deliver great service.

I love coming here for salads, as they're \"healthy\" enough, yet portioned enough not to leave hungry.

Our server was great and very accommodating. Even once we got the check, he brought us refills to-go."}
{"text":"Ask for Chris. This guy was outstanding, attentive and thorough with his menu knowledge. We couldn't remember the salad we had so he explained the one we thought we had before and he nailed it. Because he knew the menu by heart. Service was maintained through the whole meal. My wife (not the easiest customer in the world ;) ) made a few modifications to our salad and everything came out perfect. We will be returning to this location at GVR. Thanks Chris!"}
{"text":"Nicolas was amazing. My wife and I came in for a rushed lunch with a thousand errands to run. He made sure the food was expedited and everything was perfect! Great food too! I recommend the chicken and streak combo!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake has always been a safe choice for my household. We all have a favorite dish here or some kind of comfort food. I use to go to the Green Valley location and we never had less than average service. However this location really needs to step it up. Reading through reviews and based on my past couple visits it's safe to say they always fall short in the service department. I mean the annoyance of the Cheesecake Factory at the forum shop is practically worth it compared to here. 

Last night we order a couple appetizers and entrees and everything was \"half assd\". I checked into Yelp when we were seated and I had to refer back to my check in to notice it took over 15 minutes for someone to greet us. That was after I asked the busboy to get our server that was cleaning the table next to us. Then when the server came he asked us if we were ready to order our drinks as we stated yes he said h would be right back with our bread? Of the 2 appetizers we ordered we only had one brought to the table. Btw, don't ever order the Chicken Potstickers from here. They were too salty and nearly burnt. Stick to their firecracker salmon or avocado egg rolls. Someone at the table order the Steak Diane and Shrimp  Scampi (medium) and he was served well done. It was just careless acts after careless acts. Our drinks needed a refill we had to call on the busboy again. He took our drinks and brought them back without the straw. If we wanted Applebee's service and quality we would've went there.  We're definitely going to take our money elsewhere until they can do better!"}
{"text":"Food was good , the kaluha chocolate cheesecake is recommended to try . The service could have improved a little by keeping eyes on our wine glasses .  Overall was a good experience at this location ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in about 2 weeks ago for a drink and appetizer on a Friday afternoon. Their happy hour menu was phenomenal! Such a great deal and so much more food than we expected. Most importantly, we sat at the bar and Daniel waited on us. He was one of the best servers or bartenders we've had in a very long time. He was extremely friendly and made us feel like valued customers and didn't show any stress despite being busy himself. Next time we're in the area, we will call ahead to see if he's working and be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"Staffs are always pleasant. Food is good as usual. I would prefer this location than the one at Caesar's Palace."}
{"text":"I really don't remember when I was at this restaurant last time (it was definitely in NJ), so last Saturday we decided to meet our friend (and she suggested this particular location). At 5:00 PM without reservation we were taken to the table right away (I don't think this was the case for others later). The menu as I remember is a standard Cheesecake menu with a Southwestern twist (tacos, enchiladas, Mexican tortillas, Chili). Ladies ordered  from the SkinnyLicious menu (all selections are at 590 calories and less)  - Veggie Burgers. Truly yours ordered a Tuscan Chicken (also from a SkinnyLicious menu).  One thing which is really a standout  - the service. The waiter was perfect - not rushing with selections, always filling up the waters and the A/C was working full time."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is my go-to when I've a rough day or just don't feel like cooking. The portions are huge, and the service is *usually* decent.

We went last night (Tuesday) after a rough day, neither my husband or I felt like cooking. Figuring this was our best option since it would have something for everyone, we went late hoping we'd miss any crowds. But its a Tuesday night in late May, why on earth where there be a wait?

Sure enough, we got there and it was a 5 minute wait. No big deal, even though we waited more like 10-15 minutes...and that is no fun with a hungry 4 year old, when its after 8pm. Probably our mistake as parents thinking we would get a quick meal, and be in and out. 

We were seated and it took another 10 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. Our waiter did apologize for the wait but it was a very half-assed apology. Either be sincere or don't bother mentioning it. We also ordered our food since we had time to look over the menu. Drinks were slow getting out, another 10 minutes. Food was also slow getting out. We were probably here 40 minutes before we got our food. It was busy, but not that busy. 

Our waiter was nice but did not ask me once if I needed a refill on my drink, my glass was clearly empty. He did offer my husband another beer though and promptly brought that out. 

The service here just sucked, and its gotten worse every time we've come. I know losing us as customers won't make or break you, but we really are done with this location. If you must go to Cheesecake, opt for the Biltmore location!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing I had the chicken carbonara and my girlfriend had fish and chips and also tuxedo cheesecake we had Evelyn as a waitress and she is a blast definitely recommend her"}
{"text":"I don't consider The Cheesecake Factory fine dining and no one should. Their pride and joy is in their very name and they do it well. Find a friend and I bet you they have their go to cheesecake. My favorite is the turtle cheesecake hands down. Sometimes when I'm meeting friends here and I know I won't have room for the cheesecake I just take it to go. Also the avocado egg rolls are so good that I don't trust anyone that says otherwise. Me and my friends have a stare down over the last one. I also appreciate good service. Not once have I had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory and I appreciate it thar because it's just as much about the experience as it is the food."}
{"text":"The food was horrible iv been here many times to re try it and I feel like the cooks have no idea how to make that type of food and there r too many choices stick to one thing ur good at and keep it that way it seems low rank now"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and sat at a table in the bar area. Our server came over and took our drink orders rather promptly. 

The menu is huge, so it took us a few minutes. And it doesn't have photos anymore so I was looking on my phone to get a better idea of what I was going to eat.

I ordered a lunch portion of the chicken, mango and avocado salad without wonton and skinny pomegranate dressing on the side. JD ordered the sandwich, soup and salad lunch combo.

My salad arrived and looked so sad. The chicken beast it's self was flat. It wasn't plump and juicy. It looked like it had been sitting in a freezer with a 100 lb weight on it. See photos. There was hardly any avocado- maybe 1/4 of one. No almonds to be found. The fruit was definitely not fresh. I was able to squish it so easily with a fork. It had been sitting in a can. You can always tell the difference between fresh, frozen and canned fruit. Nice try with trying to pull a fast one though.

When we told our server what was wrong, she made me feel that this was somehow my fault- as did the manager. I'm sorry I didn't want crispy wontons on my salad and that I subbed dressings. It felt like that was what started this whole issue. 

They comped the salad, we canceled the cheesecake slice we were going to share at the end of our meal because giving them more money after the way we were treated simply wasn't an option. 

It's unfortunate that this is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in about 6 years and that it went so poorly. Definitely reminds me why I generally stray away from chains like this. Maybe the one at Caesars is still better...."}
{"text":"I come here at least four times a month. I love there food and there drinks. I always get the strawberry creamsicle. It is so good. With a hint of vodka for taste. They are usually crowded and packed. So make a reservation in advance for best seating. Also this restaurant seems to be dark and dim with lightning."}
{"text":"Get here early on the weekends or expect to wait over 25 min. Great drinks and apps. I .mostly come for happy hour. Try the shrimp scampi and steak diane"}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory!  I've been to a few in So.Cal, but we decided to visit this one before we head back to L.A.

I love their pastas [pasta davinci, spicy chicken chipotle pasta], but this visit I decided to try a breakfast dish.  I had Joe's Special [check out the pic] which was an egg scramble with mushrooms, onions, chicken sausage, and spinach with potatoes and toast.  It was very tasty. YUM.  I also had the drink- typhoon punch  to go with it and it was very good. Haha a cocktail with breakfast! YUM!

I also love their cheesecake [you would hope so with the restaurant named Cheesecake Factory] - I've had a few, the Godiva Cheesecake, Fresh Strawberry, Tiramisu and others which I can't remember. But they are all tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed at Cheesecake Factory. This particular location was a newer one. It was super clean., Everyone was friendly, our food was great and so was our waitress/server."}
{"text":"There is no denying the food is wonderful here. This review is about service. My girlfriend for lunch here on Saturday afternoon and we set the bar. I have the skinny menu in my hand and order the skinny shrimp summer rolls. If it comes out and I wondered why they were so big. After eating one, I asked the bartender if they were indeed the skinny ones. She said no, they were the regular ones but the only difference was there was more and they are bigger.  She asked me if it was too much food. I told her yes, that was why ordered the skinny ones.  She said oh sorry I didn't hear you say that. I get the bill and they charged for the regular ones. And they weren't going to fix it until I said something. Things like that drive me absolutely insane. I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't want or order. I brought the bartenders attention, his demeanor immediately changed. RUDE."}
{"text":"We were so excited to make the journey to Yorkdale to try out Canada's first Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at the mall around 11:00 and saw the line was crazy long. We decide it was early and would circle back. Around 3:30 we went back to see there was no line at the host stand. We spoke to the host and she said that we would get a buzzer and to come back in about an hour and check in. So we continue to shop around the stores close to the restaurant and the time passed rather quickly. We went back in a hour and she said we had about 30 more mins. So we just hung out waiting for our buzzer to go off, once it did we basically got our table right away.  

We were both starved and saw all the pasta dishes passing us by, that looked very good. So we both decided to order pasta I had the pasta carbonara with chicken and it was SO good creamy and cheesy everything a good carbonara is suppose to be. I had the lunch portion and it was still very large. My friend had a cheesy garlic pasta with chicken and herbs she quiet enjoyed it and her dinner portion was too large to finish. 

After we finished our meals our waitress told us that we needed to order the cheesecake we wanted cause there is about a 30min wait due to the large amounts of cheesecake being ordered. 

So as difficult as it was we made our choices I had the Carmel pecan turtle cheesecake and my friend had the lemon raspberry cheesecake. We both thoroughly enjoy them and each order a couple slices to go to bring home to jealous and drooling family members. Our waitress was very helpful and accommodating she made it seem like everyone does that. 

Overall we thought the experience was great and well worth the trip. We would definitely return again."}

Ah the cheese cake factory. So notoriously famous for being one of the most anticipated American chain restaurants to arrive in Toronto. 

Came on a weekday evening and there was about a 20 min wait. The wait times are very variable - at lunch I've heard there's a 5-10 min wait - dinner on a weekend an hour perhaps? The good thing is you can get a pager and walk around Yorkdale in the meantime. 

I was really looking forward to this meal because of the hype surrounding it, but I have mixed feelings. The menu is extremely extensive, there's something for everyone! Vegetarian, seafood, pasta, meat lover etc - you'll find something you want. Decided on cheese sticks as a app, fish tacos as a main and of course raspberry white chocolate cheesecake for dessert. I mean how could I not have cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory? 

The service was attentive and friendly although the restaurant was busy. 

The cheese sticks I wasn't a huge fan of - good portion size but the flavour was a bit off to me. The fish tacos were fresh and flavourful and came with plenty of sides. Good portions for the mains for sure. The cheesecake was definitely a winner - so delicious! I was so stuffed after my meal. 

There's definitely value in the meal, but it is on the pricey side. Plus the wait times and loud ambience decrease the rating for me. If you want just the cheesecake (which in my opinion is the best things on the menu) Vaughan Mills has a kiosk which sells the cheesecake for cheaper (and no line)."}
{"text":"Their service was nice and the food was mostly good. 
The food came out really slow. There were not that many people.
I had ordered the spaghetti. There wasn't enough sauce for me at least. I could barely taste it. I asked for more sauce and it tasted better than before.
I would eat here again, but if other options weren't available. I wouldn't recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours as expected since this is still a new restaurant in Toronto. Main issues:
1) My mom's steak diane was too sweet and the salmon was bland and dry
2) I ordered medium rare steak diane and instead I got medium well. 
3) I complained to the server and the serve informed me that I had to pay the regular price for a new side of steak! WTF?!
4) Server understood I shouldn't have to pay and asked what else he can do. So I asked for 2 free cheesecakes. He said he'll talk to his manager.
5) Server said they can make me a new side of steak to still try it out. I agreed
6) Good steak diane. Not sweet like my mom's steak and cooked well
7) On the bill I saw a charge of side steak $7.99, I complained. Why the hell would I pay for a side steak to fix this companies incompetence? 
8) They don't accept gift cards, even the Yorkdale gift card. 

Never going here again. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Whenever in Vegas , I always have to visit the Cheesecake Factory . 
Although I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants especially when on vacation , I find The Cheesecake Factory to always satisfy my hunger. 
The restaurant is way at the end of the Forum Shops in Caesars Palace right behind the Atlantis show which if seated on \"the patio\" gives you a great sight of the people shopping . 
Food is very good.
Prices are decent.
Service is good . 
I ordered : 
The fried calamari (12.95) 
Spaghetti w/ meatballs (15.95)
Steak w/ mashed potatoes & vegetables (19.95) 
Soft Drink 
Total : $59.00 
Tip : $6.00 ( although the service was friendly I'm not a generous tipper) 
I will continue to visit this and other locations ."}
{"text":"I love the consistency of Cheesecake Factory. The menu is the same at every location, I'm impressed with the service at every location, and my meal tastes great at every location. 

The cocktails are expensive, so don't bother unless you wanna break the bank. The best meal I've had at a Cheesecake Factory is the miso salmon. I highly recommend it. No other meal has disappointed but this one blew my mind. Also, try the mango key lime cheesecake. It's underrated."}
{"text":"Absolute horrible food and service. This place is lipstick on a pig inside and out. It doesn't belong anywhere near the biltmore. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is my go to restaurant. I've never had a bad meal.  The Rampart location in Las Vegas is much better then the District location. Its cleaner, faster and has a better view. Oddly enough I'm not a fan of their cheesecake but I am a huge fan of their chicken dishes.  Their burgers are also great.  I've never been unhappy with a meal from the Cheesecake factory.  I would advise getting their before 6 pm as it gets very busy with long wait times after 6 pm."}
{"text":"Wowza. Ok. So I came here with a reservation for 13 because we were celebrating a work milestone. Seriously, 13 people! I commend the Cheesecake Factory for being so open, welcoming, and accommodating to us. I could not even remember the last time that I came here. I believe it was about 2 or 3 years ago because we came after my friend picked out a wedding dress to celebrate. I am really surprised after this last visit that we don't come more often. Granted, the South Side area that it is in sometimes the parking can be annoying, so maybe that is it? I look forward to coming back here though!

We all looked over the menu before we got there. With this place the menu is about the size of a novel so you have to at least glance at it to get oriented to what you might want to eat. 

Appetizers:

EGGROLL SAMPLER: A Variety of All of Our Eggrolls with Avocado, Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban and Firecracker Salmon.: YUM. I got to try the firecracker salmon and the avocado. The avocado was amazing. Seriously, and that dipping sauce, totally on point. This was a nice sampler and each of the eggrolls were cut into two so we got to try more than one of the rolls. I liked the sauces as much as I liked the eggrolls!

GUACAMOLE MADE-TO-ORDER:Ripe Avocado, Onion, Tomato, Chiles, Cilantro and Fresh Lime. Served with Tortilla Chips, Salsa and Sour Cream.: Wowza, this guacamole was hot! The jalapenos in the guacamole were spicy! I mean, I liked it but dang it had some fire. I liked that the plate came with a lot of chips. I hate it when you get guacamole or even salsa and you have to keep on asking for more chips in order for the table to finish the dish, small annoyance but still. 

Entree:

CHICKEN BELLAGIO:Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad: OMG.YES.YES.YES. I wanted to go with another chicken dish but the waitress described it as, \"eh\" and the Chicken Bellagio, my second choice, she described as, \"favorite thing on the menu\". I had to then of course pick the Chicken Bellagio. I am so happy I did. First, the dinner portion was huge. The chicken came in two pounded out thin breasts so I just put one and half the pasta into a box right away so I wouldn't be tempted to eat it. This dish was banging. Seriously. The Parmesan cream sauce was delish and the basil pasta was not overwhelming at all. It was a very subtle flavor. The chicken was pounded thin and was a crisp perfection. I loved the salad that topped the dish. It added some live green to the dish that complemented everything really well. YUM. The only thing is, the prosciutto was in strips. I wish that it was cut up maybe just a little. It was hard to cut through, as prosciutto usually is so smaller pieces might have made the dish a bit easier to eat.

I did not eat any dessert because after the fresh bread at the table, the apps, and the dinner, I could not fit another thing into my belly. 

I know that I am usually not the biggest fan of chain restaurants but  this was a great experience and the food was AWESOME. I look forward to my next trip to the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I celebrated my 29th birthday here with my cousins.  I love them with all my heart.  I don't think I could be who I am today if I didn't have my cousins to grow up with.  For my 29th, they took me to Cheesecake Factory at Boca Park.  Also, I was here to celebrate my 30th birthday with my parents, and I hung out with one of my friend's here.  No, I'm not a Cheesecake Factory Lover, for some reason I would end up here from time to time.

You don't need a reservation, however at times you'll find your self waiting if you don't have a reservation.  Most of the time it's on a Friday and Saturday that's it's busy.  But what restaurant isn't busy on those two days?  What I like about this spot is the fact it's a huge facility.  When I entered through the huge double doors that seem to reach the ceiling, I found how clean it was.  There was not a trash on site.  The restaurant was super clean and well kept.  I was very impressed by that.

Upon seating, I notice that servers aren't really great.  They always seem to be in a hurry and don't take the time.  I always felt like I was being hurried.  If I took my time, they take forever to get back to me before I can order.  This always happened here.

Let's start with appetizers.  I liked their Fire Roasted Artichokes.  I thought that was a good choice.  It took a long time to get through it but you don't feel so full after eating it.  Their Fried Calamari was just mediocre.  It had too much flour on it and it wasn't as plumpy or juicy as Philippino's make it.  My dad makes them better.  Another you can't go wrong with is the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip.  It's a good starter and isn't too salty.  As for the negatives, don't order their Lettuce Wraps.  It's just not good enough, even to compare to P.F. Chang's.   

The only entree I can remember that I liked was the Meat Loaf.  It tasted very good and was very filling.  The serving portions are so great that you can even take it home with you and eat the rest for lunch the next day.  I only go here if I don't feel like thinking about what to eat and where to go.  Maybe that's why I always end up here."}
{"text":"When here on a quiet weekday and I have to say the time means nothing. The serve was horrible and the food was not brought to us in a timely manner. Quality of food was its normal fair, but the reason to go to the cheese cake factory was always for the cheese cake.
Serve was so bad we asked to speak with the manager and I must say he was a condescending jerk to put it nicely.
This location has fallen so badly i would be hard pressed to ever go there for just a cheese cake.
Too bad a good idea has been franchised and in personalize to the point where a once big admirer may never go back again."}
{"text":"came for dinner and had the best service ever the waitress jessica greeted us with a smile made us feel very welcomed and the food was so amazing and fast my drink was never empty she was very obsrvant if you were in the area and wanting great service come here and ask for jessica she is amazing and i truly will be back for the amazing food dessert and great service!!"}
{"text":"One thing about cheesecake factory that I love is that they stay consistent with food..their menu is always the same and each dish is prepared the same every time. When you come here the only thing that may bug me is their service.It's like one day I'll eat here and the server is awesome and the next time it's the total opposite.But I will gladly take it for the food is key. I normally stick to a couple things here but I've tried alot of things that are amazing.

My faves are
Ahi tempura roll
Shrimp and bacon club
Rib eye steak with garlic mashed potatoes that comes with one delicious onion ring( I wish they came with 5 of them..lol)
Miso salmon (sometimes the rice is too hard and uncooked)
Cabonara 
Of course the red velvet cheesecake is the best
(Ive tried alot of other dishes here like breakfast stuff like the chicken hash and the Monte cristo sandwich but they weren't really memorable)


Oooh and don't forget about that bread! Yummy! I will always have cheescake factory as an option for a meal any day of the week"}
{"text":"I have to go with 4 stars only because I am not a fan of the HUGE portion sizes.  To many people that may be a plus but that is the ONLY downfall.  Beautiful space with good atmosphere especially for a restaurant that is so busy (30 minute wait in mid-afternoon).

Definitely try the Ahi Tartare and the Avocado Rolls.  Even my kids loved them.  I had the Factory Chop Salad and it was fantastic and light.  My hubby had Renee's Special, cup of soup, half sandwich, and a gorgeous salad.  He ran 10 miles so he finished the WHOLE thing.  

No room for dessert.  Isn't that embarrassing!  Worth the wait, food is always quite good, just remember the portions are ginormous!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant. Some may find it odd that I rarely even get cheesecake here. Their food is very high quality. A huge menu which I've had the pleasure of trying out most of their options. A meal can range anywhere from $12 (for a burger) to $30 (for the filet). $20-25 per person is the usual on how much I spend. What makes it so great is the food is worth the price but portions are usually double or even triple size.

My favorite appetizer is the fried macaroni and cheese. My favorite entree is the ribeye. And the best entree for the money, is the Cajun Chicken Littles. About 10-12 normal sized, delicious, hand breaded, crispy, chicken tenders, a scoop of awesome mashed potatoes, and some very good corn succotash; just a $15.99 price tag.

Highly recommend TCF."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is nothing if not reliable. You know exactly what to expect on a visit from the service right down to the food. 

Visited late (9 pm) on a Thursday night and had good service. Was seated next to the bus station which turned out to be very distracting (servers rolling silverware, etc.). 

Margaritas hit the spot (although not as good as at CF at Union Square in San Francisco!). Everyone's meals were tasty and filling (chicken enchiladas, flatbread, fettuccine, 4 cheese pasta). 

Will probably be back during our visit because it's one of the few restaurants where everyone in the family can find something they love."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend. Michael L. was our waiter. He was wonderful. He was on top of all of our requests. Some before we even said them. Come see him! Great experience!"}
{"text":"First off, this branch is always, always full which is why the wait is always long. I would have given this place another star if it weren't for the long wait all the time. After waiting for 25 minutes, our party of 2 was seated... quite close to other tables that seated 2 people. It would be nice to have more space. They definitely need to make room for the volume of costumers they get. 

But anyway, I ordered a Veggie Melt sandwich. It doesn't sound exciting but it was de-licious! I didn't even miss meat while I was stuffing my face, which I think is a sign of a good veggie dish. I also had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake which of course was good but a little too sweet for me.

The service was great, no complaints here. Our server in particular was attentive and quick. 

All in all, a good experience but a word of warning: you will be likely to over eat given the HUGE portions."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in a minute... Flew into Arizona Friday and had dinner here. Well more like i had \"appetizers\" here cause i wasn't too hungry because i ate at the airport before i left. I would have rated this place 4 stars had it have not been for our friendly server Hallie. Nothing like a server that knows what they're doing :) She's a keeper!"}
{"text":"The Srvice so poor!!! So sad place like cheese cake factory didn't know what's Costmer service it's mean?!?! Our server Tyler need more training .
Me and my family very disappointed."}
{"text":"We go here occasionally as a treat when in the area...  tonight was really great with exceptional service(from James, our server) and our order customized exactly as we liked!  Will continue to patronize this Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Mission: Lady Kay was owed an official belated St. Valentine's Day dinner. What did the dart land on? Cheesecake Factory. Wanting to avoid the wild, wooly South Side, we came all the way out to the Forbidden Land of Ross Park Mall. 

Never before have I ever had to wait for over 2 hours to be seated anywhere. I was reluctant.

\"I didn't come all the way out here to eat in a damned mall food court,\" Kay snarled, her hunger making her into someone that was not my beloved.

\"But babe, I read that there's a Five Guys, and I always wanted to try...\"

I saw cat's eyes, angry cat's eyes staring back at me. 

\"Ok, give me the glowing beeper,\" I said to the kid behind the desk. 

And off to the Mall we went to burn extra time. 

When we returned, we waited another 20 minutes, played peekaboo with a darling baby girl who was being held by her dad, and were then seated. 

By this point we were becoming flesh-munching undead. 

Cheesecake Factory has a bewilderdingly extensive menu despite being centered around their dizzying varieties of cheesecake. 

They also appear to have a fixation on that mobster of the vegetable world; the avocado. It's in half their dishes, from app's to ent's.

They purport that their guacamole is as Sheetz sez, M-T-O. However, we already had something to tide us over at the mall, so we went straight for main courses. 

I SO wanted to try that fresh guac though. So what did I do?

I got it on a burger. No questions asked by our adept server Vicki, no funny stares. 

CF calls 'em Glamburgers, and like the cheesecake, there are many different kinds. You'd think they'd have voluminous, teased-up hair and a thing for cocaine and groupies.

Mine had American Kobe beef and came with grilled onions and mushrooms, but in addition to the guac, I got mayo, tomato, and lettuce, just to make it...rock. 

And for the most part it did. It was served on a sweetly toasted and buttery sesame seed bun and came off like an Eat 'N Park Superburger that fell out of a limo and into a gutter wearing nothing but leather pants and boots. 

I'd never had Kobe beef before, so here I was with a chance to try it. Now, it has been THE rage for a long spell. However, I also recall someone on seriouseats.com saying that it tasted like cat food. Hmmm.

To my gaping maw, it was just a pretty damn fine burger. It wasn't as transcendent or ascendant as it had been hyped to be nor was it something passe as the Pitchforkesque foodies would have you believe. I mean, as a burger, this falls before the mighty Tessaro's or Cheeburger Cheeburger or Burgatory, but I can't say it would tap out easily. Pink inside, charred blacker than night on the outside, it makes a comeback before succumbing to an armbar in the 4th round. 

NIIICE fries, guys, cooked twice 'cause they were illegally crispy/chewy. They come in a metal cup with an inlay of bakery tissue paper which I always find to be a cool, cool touch. The tin cup was HOT, though. Vicki told us she burnt her hand on it. Ow.

Shepherd's Pie. A fancy chain like CF happens to have it on their menu (what don't they have?). I've never had it before until last night when I sampled what Lady Kay ordered. 

Thumbs up, dude. Mashed potato, minced meat, it all held together well like the Thin Lizzy of old used to (cue the harmonized axe licks). I felt the thick, succulent comfort, y'know? 

Dessert would come next, and if the large selection of cheesecake flavors isn't plenty, they have sundaes, cakes, apple cobblers, tiramisu, and even a plain bowl of strawberries. Dilemmas afire! 

Inspired by an ill-fated visit to the store of the same name, Kay got the Godiva cheesecake. Feeling Aquarian, I went against the grain and got  Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake, which contains a layer of their Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake. Each is served with clouds of whipped cream and their fresh hot fudge (for extra $). 

Eh. Now, I got a gander at their brothel of goodies in the foyer and was tempted, but my chocolate cake turned out to be as what my reg'lars know as a bimbo dessert; all looks, not enough taste. Not that it was horrid. It looked like a dominatrix with all those chocochips acting as studs and was impressive to behold overall. It had a hide like an armadillo in fact. Upon taking a bite though, I could tell that it had been sitting around a while after having been shipped in suspended animation. I can think of a number of indy bakeries in Pittsburgh that best CF at their own game, easily. Fresh is always better. 

Kay's cheesecake was a little more interesting, but if Godiva chocolate is that unaffordable, then folks are gettin' swindled. It was chilly and errr...moussy in flavor with a bombastic presentation. Fine to look at, when you get to know her, you find you weren't missing out. The whipped cream was flat and the runny hot fudge only slightly less-so. Yeah, we thought the desserts would rawk too. Bummer."}
{"text":"I had visitors in town and decided to grab a table for 5 after spending some time in the Forum Shops. It took about 40 minutes to be seated, and after ordering a good 45-50 minutes for our food to come out. I would understand the wait if the restaurant had been very busy, but it was later in the evening and over half the tables in the restaurant were empty by the time we sat down. We also had a very simple order which included 3 burgers and a salad. The waiter never offered to bring extra bread for the table while waiting, nor did he stop by to refresh drinks. Our table was also half prepared and didn't even have napkins until I requested some.

Everyone was content with their food, but the poor service made the experience one I don't care to repeat any time soon."}
{"text":"I am not used to not waiting at least an hour to get into a cheesecake factory (that's how it was in south fl anyhow). I got seated during the regular dinner hour on a Thursday within about 10min of walking in. I sat near the bar area (not on a high top) and loved it because it was moody and cozy. We ordered the Korean fried Cauliflower bites to start and OMG,  just get that already! I've tried cauliflower in so many different ways throughout the years and this definitely makes my top 3 list! Absolutely dee-lish! As a vegetarian it was pretty much salad, pastas without any meat (a little overpriced for my taste) or a veggie burger. The veggie burger was pretty good but I wish it either came with a cool sauce or when it gets delivered it actually has the condiments you ordered with it (like mayo, mustard, etc.) I waited about 5 min to get these (lucky for me, I actually don't mind room temp food). My server was busy taking an order at a different table so not really her fault. The pork chop dish my partner got was really great, my veggie burger was ok as were the fries. For dessert we ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake which was VERY, VERY delicious! Took that to go because I was full. All in all, we had a nice dinner and experience. I don't eat out at chains too often but have always enjoyed my Cheesecake factory meals in the past."}
{"text":"We decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory on a busy friday night. We waited for a table in the bar and sat at the first available. Boy were we lucky! Our server, Lisa, was phenomenal! She got to us quickly, our drinks came out quickly, and they stayed full all night. Food does take a bit to come out, but it was worth it! Lisa recommended the Chicken Madera and that was the best dish Ive ever had here! Thanks for the amazing service and excellent food!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat Cheesecake Factory. One of my favorites. Jus had the salad and nachos tonight. The salad made it healthy for me. At least that's what I'm going with. The food was great as always."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received at a Cheesecake Factory. Our server Morgan was extremely rude and got our orders completely wrong."}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good and not too pricey. We came here for lunch and the wait was about 15 mins or so, and food came pretty fast after we ordered. We ordered the Sheila's chicken and avocado salad, the grilled salmon and lasagne. I really liked my salad, the portion was big and very tasty. The seating space was also spacious enough for 3 adults and 3 babies. So all in all an enjoyable experience. We didn't try the cheesecake because the lunch was filling enough but next time for sure we will get some!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying this location is far better than the location in Schaumburg. 

So that's out of the way. Their menu is huge. Ridiculously so. That has its ups and downs. It takes you a bit to decide on what you actually want to order, but there's probably something for everyone with a wide range of selection. Normally on a huge menu, quality suffers, but I don't really feel like that's an issue here. The issue is getting orders right. That being said, it would be nice if they'd pick a genre and stick with it. 

The items on the menu are super caloric and they are a bit overpriced. I exclusively order from the Skinnylicious menu at this point, but it's been hit or miss. I love love love their Ahi Tartare. I've tried other items off of that menu with mixed results. I find some of the dishes, while low in calories, have a super high sodium content. I do recommend that tartare though. It's fresh and awesome. 

The problem areas with this restaurant tend to be the staff and the kitchen. The staff is always super friendly, but they're also very busy so service can suffer there. I've also had issues with making special requests, and the server getting it wrong. (I'm not pretentious, I have an allergy). When the servers aren't overwhelmed and making mistakes because of it, the kitchen picks up that mantle. As much as I love that tartare it has come out differently every time I've ordered it. It's got very few things involved on it, so you'd think replicating iy roughly the same each time would be easy. 

I'd love to talk about the cheesecake, but it's really hard for me to find any that doesn't have nuts in it. The two times I have ordered any, there was some confusion about it having nuts or not. So I'm not the person to ask about that. 

Overall, it's not a bad place, but it's also not great. It makes a good lunch date spot to save on cost."}
{"text":"Service and Atmosphere were very good. The waiter was very nice and seemed like he cared about our time. The bread was very very good warm and yummy. The burger was greasy, had no taste, and overall it was awful. The fries were not cooked all the way the potatoes seemed raw in the inside. The cheesecake my dramatic mom had she said \"Oh it's incredible\". Overall it was a good meal and I'd come again just not to order a cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"Would only come here for their cheesecakes for take out.. don't waste your time waiting for 2-3 hours just to get a table and then you'll take awhile to pick what you want to eat because their menu is crazy!!! They make it so hard for you to choose because they have more than 250 items on their menu. Overall , good food and awesome cheesecakes!!"}
{"text":"My review was\" we'll be back\". Orange chicken was very tasty with plenty to still have room for cheesecake."}
{"text":"Had a horrible service from this location. I work within the mall so Cheesecake is the only real food place to get food. We have their menu in our store and we order all the time. I called 30 mins before my lunch to make sure my order was good to go as always, I placed an order of Fried Calamari, good to go. I went over there on my lunch to pick it up and there was nothing. No sign of my order being there. I couldn't have called the wrong location because it's the only phone number we have of them and we call it all the time. The staff and managers seem to be clueless and not even the slightest apologetic of my inconvenience. So I still paid and tried to wait for my food but still took almost 20 minutes where the at the time did not seem to be busy at all. They said that it was coming right up and I waited it was almost time for me to clock back in when I got my food to go and it looked really half assed. The amount of food I got was about half of what I would usually get and they had a soggy piece of napkin underneath the food. It was not fresh, it was not even remotely warm. I was not happy with the experience and staff did not try to do much to help out the situation."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! The lighting was a bit to dark for me, although the food was amazing and that's why we're all here now isn't it! The wait wasn't too long. Seating was intimate and I appreciate y server placing me at a table for two and not a table for four with two empty seats. That's a plus! Appetizers, entree, and desserts all came out with time to enjoy each course. The price isn't as expensive as my friends have been saying. It's decent and the refills keep coming for drinks. My server was really nice and speedy! I love the atmosphere in this restaurant!! Relaxing!

Pros: Decent price, food chain, delicious food, great service, intimate setting, appealing decor

Cons: A little crowded, dark lighting, no music, no wifi, no apple pay that I could see

Overall: I'll be back very soon! Keep up the great work guys! I'm satisfied and happy!"}
{"text":"This location is nice, but our service today was mediocre at best. They seem to be too busy to care to provide quality. I had the chicken salad sandwich which was more mayonnaise, than anything else. They even put heavy mayo on the bread when the chicken salad was already oozing with mayo. The salad was poor quality, and the server was not knowledgeable of the menu. There was four of us, so overall the food was delivered properly. The server did not offer to correct the matter, but asked if I wanted to talk to a manager. She should ave just taken the food and had it served properly."}
{"text":"Planned a family birthday party here and we were so pleasantly surprised. Early arrivals found the bartender very pleasant and knowledgeable, and excellent appetizers.  Our server Mariye (aka Ilene), made our experience so much fun. She was quick, smart and had a great sense of humor. The miso salmon was exceptional. Great service, great menu!"}
{"text":"It took a long time to get seated, party of eitght. But once we were, Victoria really took care of us. Lots of questions, some not so reasonable, that she handled like a pro.  Dinner was excellent and staged perfectly (drinks, apps, main).

And then we asked for... bacon cheesecake! 

Not on menu.  Victoria made it for us and it was beautiful!  Straight cheesecake with bacon sprinkled over the top and whipped cream with bacon stuck in it!"}
{"text":"The only good thing is the cheesecake. The food is terribly mediocre. And I hate how they seem to all be decorated like ruins of some sort. I want some damn food not an expedition with Fernando!"}
{"text":"Our family met at The Cheesecake Factory for Mother's Day last night. All started out great, we were seated and given our menus. At first the waitress was great but then for some reason she became very rude.  My husband was sitting across the table from me and each time she would, I don't know what you would call it ... but bump into him. At first I thought \"it happens, I mean we were both siting at the end of the table\" but I watched it happen over and over again. At one point she knocked the spoon and knife off the table on to the floor, I mean you could here it. Even the 2 women next to us looked. No apology, nothing. I would have said something but our family was enjoying their dinner and it wasn't the time or the place at that point.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'mI legit LOVE the Cheesecake Factory! that being said my 20 something dollar steak i just got delivered is sort of a joke. 3 tiny bites?? I'm confused is this an 20 dollar appetizer or???? i can say iy is at least warm"}
{"text":"I visited Cheesecake Factory for a friend's birthday party. There was a medium sized group of us, approx. 12. Blue, our waiter, was amazing and very attentive. I ate the Cajun jambalaya over rice. My boyfriend had a kale & quinoa salad that was DELICIOUS! Overall, a great experience. I always order the white chocolate raspberry Cheesecake and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I wish I could have gave this 0 stars but I can't first thing there was a hair in my food and everyone has only ate a little of there food and had to stop cuz we was disgust my one friend Alex was sick from it them we got the manager and she only was gonna say sry then we was like can u take all this off and she only took the noodles off although we a couldn't eat our food it seems like everytime I come there there's a problem or hair in my food and I think it's because we ask for our food crispy when I ask Chrispy we get a hair when we don't no hair plus very rude customer service NEVER EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Just picked up a couple slices of cheesecake to go...asked if there was military discount...there isn't...but the guy behind me orders his slices (and he wreaks of marijuana) he gets a discount for working at the outlets..I kinda see something wrong with that...oh well..I can't wait to move to Germany"}
{"text":"It is amazing how inefficiently run this establishment is. I honestly believe the reason why this place has an extensive wait is because they do not know how to function efficiently. Sure, the food is good, and their menu has something for everyone, but that won't keep people coming back when their service is so terribly slow and poorly run. 

Tonight was just a night to come in a get a slice of to-go cheesecake. Not a sit down meal, but just a cheesecake slice from the counter, boxed up to enjoy at home (as they were on a three hour wait at 8pm). I was able to walk up, choose my two slices from the counter and pay in record time, and was informed it would be about five minutes. Well, fast forward 40, that's right FORTY, minutes, I was still standing there, waiting for my to-go cheesecake. There were at least 6 employees behind the counter, but maybe 3 doing work. When my name was finally called, I gladly accepted my order, then stepped away to check it. Well, one of my cheesecakes was wrong, so back to the counter I went, where I was informed, rather rudely, that it would be about 20 minutes for my correct slice....that I could still see, sitting in the case. Rather than waiting, I just took the cheesecakes and left. 

I'm not sure the deliciousness of the cheesecakes can counter the amazingly poor experience I just went through."}
{"text":"I typically order to-go as it's always super crowded. My order is always right, portions are huge, and they deliver curb side which is great when you have kids"}
{"text":"This was the first time at the cheesecake factory. The food was really good they give you bread to start. Portions were pretty big as well my wife and I shared the macaroni and cheese bites which were amazing, we shared the shepherds pie as well plenty of food for us both. Of course we has a piece of cheesecake we had the tieramesu it was fantastic... the restaurant was clean and staff was great. Definitely check it out prices were not bad at all either!!"}
{"text":"Have had the cheesecake but never been to the restaurant.  I knew the place as large and was wondering about the service.  Well the service was good.  They seem to use expeditors to deliver food, so it came out hot.  My Cuban sandwich was good.  It had the usual pork, ham, cheese and tasty pickle.  Had the sweet potato fries as the side that were your standard but good sweet potato fries.

The SkinnyLisious menu had some interesting choices.  The Shrimp taco looked good, and the person that ordered it, was not about to share.  They received a really nice vegetable salad that had a somewhat sweet flavored dressing that was really tasty."}
{"text":"We've been to this location several times in the last two years. It is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes it's amazing, usually it's pretty good, and other times we walk away wondering if we'll be back. Tonight was a pretty good night. We were seated pretty quickly and our waitress came right up to the table and got our drinks started and asked if we wanted bread. A few minutes later she brought water and subsequently the drinks we had ordered and some bread. From the point that she took our food order and when we received it seemed fairly
Quick. Everyone was happy with their food, it was seasoned pretty well and everything came out correctly. We ordered our cheesecakes to go and got those fairly quickly too. I was pretty happy with tonight because it was busy but we didn't feel forgotten or like we were a burden to our waitress. There are so many new restaurants around the area so it will probably be a while before we are back, but we aren't taking it off the table of one our favorite restaurants. I love that, like starbucks, no matter which one you go to, it is pretty much consistent."}
{"text":"I am in Ohio on business and eat at the Cheesecake factory almost every night I am in Cleveland.  The menu is big and has a nice variety of foods.  There are a decent number of super healthy salads and dishes that makes it possible to have a desert some nights without totally killing my diet.  The quality of the food is excellent and the service is always superior.  Highly recommend this restaurant.   The only time I stay away is Friday and Saturday night because I know the place will be just packed."}
{"text":"Avocado Egg Rolls are delicious!  We ordered the Chicken with Lemon Couscous & Blackened Shrimp dinners.  Of course had to get the chocolate mousse cheesecake to go...the best!  The Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone.  Only bad thing about this location was cleanliness...our table wasn't very clean when we sit down and overall sanitation could be better."}
{"text":"My girfriend and I Came here for Sunday brunch on Victoria day wknd and food was amazing and they now have an outdoor patio. My girlfriend and I went to patio without a lineup during brunch hours between 10am and 2pm. Highly recommend going between those hours to avoid lineup"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered takeout for our anniversary. It was easy to order, but then we had a few issues with pick up. First, it took a really long time for our food to be ready and then when we went to park in the designated togo spots, they were filled but no one was inside.

I ordered the chicken Madeira which was good, but I lost all of my sauce in my mashed potatoes. Next time, I'll ask for some extra on the side. 

My husband got the Cuban and fries and thought they were good.

We ordered two cheesecake slices, which were of course the best part."}
{"text":"The past few times I've eaten here the food has been amazing! This includes brunch and lunch. I didn't expect the brunch items to be that great but I was wrong!  A must try is the Baja Chicken Hash or the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes!  My new favorite lunch item there is the Miso Salmon!! Can't wait to go back! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of how long it takes to get your appetizer/food."}
{"text":"This is your joint for American style cheesecake - rich, creamy and HUGE! 

I went on a Saturday morning (10 am) because it was on the way downtown so I waited in line for 10-15 minutes and got my order within 5 minutes! Got the strawberry cheesecake, chocolate hazelnut and the celebration.

I had the celebration - too sweet for my taste (and for the portion), should maybe add a jam in between the layers to cut through all that sugar with something a little sharp and sour. There was a small layer of strawberry filling, maybe make that more tart? But it was decent. Decadent and for the amount of cake you're getting, worth the $10.

The choco hazelnut and strawberry were less sweet and even suited the tastes of my family, who have less tolerance for heavy, sweet desserts. So I suggest go for those! 

I also had the vanilla bean cheesecake when I was in Chicago - that was delicious! Lighter in flavour and definitely tasted the vanilla. 

So I think it's worth checking out if you loooove cheesecake and you're at Yorkdale during slower times. Also kudos to the takeout staff for great service."}
{"text":"I like to come here for the atmosphere and the food is good, but I don't know why every one of my visits are awful due to poor service . This particular Cheesecake Factory is 7 mins from where I live so it's very convenient for me, but because of the poor service I have to drive all the way to Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Cheese cake factory is way over rated the spinach appetizer was very bland wasn't even salted, $8.50 for a little glass of wine also had the factory burger which was nothing but ground beef and sautéed onions on a Italian club roll that tasted like old bread that was warmed up in a microwave by the time I get down to my last couple of bites I could barely bite into the bread it was so hard The french fries were not fresh either they dried up real quick, my sisters chicken club sandwich was just okay. So appetizer one factory burger/ fries one chicken club sandwich/fries one glass of wine two glasses of iced tea and one slice of  Lemon meringue pie which I might add was very very good $72 with tip included overrated and expensive.
To be fair this review does not pertain to the cheesecake factory location on Las Vegas Blvd., South, I was reviewing the cheesecake factory in Green Valley In Henderson I just could not find it in the database"}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner tamale corn cakes and Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta which was great."}
{"text":"First up: know that I've never been a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, mainly because the portion sizes are so huge. I don't want all that food, nor do I want to PAY for all that food that I do not want...

Got some gift cards for Christmas, so off we went.

They've got a new (new to me, anyway) menu section of starters/small plates, separate from the appetizer menu, which I think is just PERFECT and completely removes my primary gripe with the restaurant! 

I had their Vietnamese Tacos--bbq pork and crunchy, fresh and spicy cucumber/carrot slaw on steamed buns (3). DELICIOUS! The steamed buns were slightly sweet, so soft...it was a perfect combination for me. I think it was $6.95.  I had a similar sandwich at Emeril Lagasse's NOLA, and I have to say that this one was much tastier.
I underestimated the portion on the small plate and also ordered a pear, arugula & Gorgonzola flatbread (maybe they call it a pizzette?). Was lovely, but I took most of it home and enjoyed it for lunch today. 

Skipped the cheesecake and desserts. Just tryin to be good. 

Service was great.

All in all, they've gotten themselves a new return customer by offering the choice of not getting 3 days' worth of meals on one plate. Yay!"}
{"text":"Love this Cheesecake Factory! The food is just right every time i eat there! This time. We had fantastic service at the bar during happy hour. The happy hour food deals are excellent, though there are no drink specials.

We enjoyed the artichokes-my fave and the artichoke crab dip. Both were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection.


I wish we had a Cheesecake Factory near me!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Terrible service. Seated at a dirty table, then only wiped one small spot of table off. Brought out a salad that was more like soup.  Didn't even make my kiddos sandwich as described on menu. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this restaurant. Always a good meal and they make accommodations for customers with food allergies. Chipotle Chicken Pasta is by far our favorite dish"}
{"text":"Where to start?  Walking in, it had the feel of a Vegas casino.  I know that sounds strange, but hear me out.  It's large, open, and feels fancy with browns and golds throughout the dining area.  But what really got me was the smell.  It had the aura of a piped-in perfume, much like some Las Vegas casinos and their reception areas.  I'm not complaining - it was nice, but not what I expected.

We sat down as a group of 8.  Plenty of room - it wasn't busy at all (11:45am on a Monday).  As we all know by now, the menu is extensive.  Knowing this ahead of time, I was browsing online to narrow down my choices so I was ready at game time.  I went with the pit beef dip sandwich that came with fries.  I had heard about the gigantic portions, so I figured for the $14.50 I would eat half of it for lunch and save the other half for dinner.  When it arrived, I was a little disappointed to see it was \"normal sized\".  It was delicious - no doubt.  I'd eat this again (and again and again).  The portion of fries was also reasonable.  Frankly, it was a great portion for lunch, but the price was steep for what I got.

Everyone else seemed pretty happy with their food - ranging from jambalaya to white chili to a chicken parm sandwich.  As we all got our food and started to eat, we noticed one in our party had no food.  After a minute, a manager (SUPER nice and very attentive) came by to apologize for the meal not being ready - it was done, but not done properly, so they were making it again.  Great - I love that they have standards!  The manager also was quick to say there would be no charge for that meal.  When it came out, we all thought it looked great.

I'm not a big cheesecake fan.  I love cheese.  I really love cake.  But let's keep them separate, please.  So I miss out on that draw with this place.

All in all, I'd eat here again, but I'd rather do it with a BOGO coupon or something that dials in my perceived value.  Or if work was buying or something.  If I was out with people and they said \"hey, let's grab lunch somewhere\", I would suggest something else (financial decision).  The food is really good, but lots of places offer that.

If the prices are more reasonable, I bump this to 4 stars."}
{"text":"We came at a really busy time so service was sort of slow but our waitress was good. Super friendly and the drinks were good, food was excellent. I ordered garlic pasta and it was to die for.  It was a little loud for my liking and there were tons of families in there for a sunday afternoon. Tbis happens to be b onenof my favorite places to eat in the  Crocker Park area."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Cheesecake Factory food & ambiance, this is a good one. Popular Friday night spot in a fun area of town, folks were dressed in their good-doin' clothes - maybe it was the day of the week, but it felt more upscale than most CF's. 

The lemon-dill salmon was amazing & I'm sure I could eat a big bowl of their mashed pots. Cheesecake (white chocolate raspberry truffle, this time) was amazing. 

Exceptional service at a place that generally does food & service well; overall great experience."}
{"text":"We always look forward to coming up to the Cheesecake Factory. They offer quite the variety of food. Also most all their pastas are available in a gluten free option, and tastes great. Sad to say most of the time I'm to stuffed to make it to their cheesecake. Which I think is some sort of foodie code violation. But  you can get a piece to go or better yet a whole cake frozen to go. Just make sure when you order gluten free to remind the kitchen to make any meat toppings gluten free also. (Like grilled chicken instead of breaded)"}
{"text":"I feel mostly bad for the staff at this location because they don't have enough staff for that big of a restaurant. Food was fine and the service people were all nice, but it took over a hour to get our food and by the time we got it we were full off bread. I was just happy when we got water! I'm thinking that's my last experience at Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time I had the Mac & Cheese Burger which tasted like a giant salt ball that left me thirsty for hours on end afterwards.  Quite disappointment.  We received a gift card to go again, this time I had the White Chicken Chili which advertised a \"Generous\" amount of chili. Upon getting the dinner it was actually quite the small amount of chili especially with the price of $14.  Pretty disappointment for the amount of food and the cost, went home had some more food.  More of a personal preference, but I don't really enjoy cilantro, which I think was in the salsa they added to the chili.  Can't say I'm a fan of the salsa it in, it ruined the texture of the food.  Can't say that I will ever want to go back.  The wait staff was very friendly and that's the only reason I'm not giving it a 1 star.  

Update: Went back and tried it again, had the Southwest Chicken panini (I have a hard time remembering the name) and it was really good.  Really enjoyed myself this time.  Wait staff, again was very friendly.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal , Andrew had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, he said it was amazing, I had Fish and Chips that were pretty good.
Bernardo was our server, he was great, fast and friendly, we have been to this Cheesecake Factory quite a few times and he was the best server ever.
Thank you Cheesecake Factory for such a great employee.
I hope this review is shared with him."}
{"text":"Gave it 2 stars for the server. He was amazing always came by to get refills and to keep the table cleared he is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.

Atmosphere is weird and the servers look like they should be in a 5 star restaurant they look uncomfortable being all dressed up. 
First time at a Cheesecake Factory and probably will be my last time.
I ordered a medium rare bone in NY Strip Steak they don't list oz on the menu and I know why at $21 I would have expected more, the steak is maybe 1/2in thick maybe a little more. If you order a steak at the Waffle House they are about the same thickness. It arrived cold and over cooked due to sitting for a while more than likely, I was given a new steak that was hot and properly to temp after speaking with a manager. The potatoes were also cold and had a crust on them and the vegetables were greasy and everything on the plate was super super salty. For the price it was a let down, even if there were no issues with taste and temperature. I could have spent less money and gone to like Chilis and gotten a steak more than twice the thickness. The desert I ordered was the tiramisu it was delicious but the portion for the price is also leaves more to be desired the whip cream dollops were bigger than the slice of tiramisu. Over all its one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had both in value and food quality."}
{"text":"The food was really yummy! Our waitress Isis was super attentive, quick, and extremely nice ever though we went one a Friday night (it was super busy in the restaurant)! We had the twice baked tater tots which taste like deep fried heaven! The orange chicken had a nice slight orange flavor, the classic burger was good (even though I don't particularly care for the big chunk of grilled onion that comes on it) I actually switched my boyfriends red sliced onion on his mac and cheese burger with the grilled onion on my classic burger. If you like mojito's then try the pineapple mojito serve with a fresh pineapple slice, that rum will creep up on you but it tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Me and my family visited The Cheesecake Factory for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  First off, we are not from Charlotte and we do not have a Cheesecake factory near our house.  We are Big Bang Theory super fans so when we saw it we knew we had to try it.   If you are like us and have never been or saw one other than on the show, then you will be in for a big surprise too!  

Atmosphere:  We arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night.  The wait was minimal even though it was pretty busy.  We requested outside seating since it was a perfect night for it, and were escorted right out.  Tables were nice, and had a small candle on it for a nice little touch.  The building the restaurant is located in is very nice as well.  Very upscale looking and a classy place overall.  Much different vibe and style than was in the show.  ( Hang with me through the BBT show comments, I am sure others are wondering the same as we were. )  8/10

Menu and Price Point:  As most others have mentioned the menu is very very extensive.  You would be really hard pressed to not find something that you like.  Very detailed which I like because I am a picky eater, and nicely laid out considering the size of the menu.  As for price, I got the Penne, My wife got the Chicken and Biscuits (think chicken pot pie), and my daughter just wanted cheese sticks.  We also got 1 piece of the Oreo Dream cheesecake and the total bill was 53.00 and some change.  Not too bad considering the portions are huge and the food was very tasty.  7/10

Service:  When we first walked in the greeter was not super friendly like most places of that caliber but, when we were seated things changed.  Our waiter was extremely nice and super helpful.  He was very attentive despite being pretty busy, and took the time to talk to us and offer suggestions.  He even addressed my daughter who is 10, which most of the time wait staff just look at us for her order.  I liked that and i think she did too.  8/10

Food:  The food was very good.  Like i mentioned above my daughter got an appetizer for her main meal which was the Cheesesticks.  She liked them and even made the comment she wished there was more.  On a couple they were overcooked a little but she didnt complain and just peeled off the coating.  My wife had the Chicken and Biscuits and she really enjoyed it and gives it a 8/10.  She could only eat about half a quarter of it due to the sheer amount she was given.  I got the Penne Pasta, and it was cooked perfect for me.  It was a little short on sauce but really was very tasty.  I did add a little salt, and I asked the waiter for some Parmesan cheese and he brought out a block and grated some fresh for me right at the table.  Im a big guy and I couldn't eat it all due to the portion size.  8/10 for me on the pasta.  

I will definitely be back for me on my next visit.  

P.S.... Haven't tried the cheesecake yet but its a massive slice."}
{"text":"Ate today at lunch and last night. Must have a new cook because I got the same Louisiana pasta and it was like i was eating pasta in oil both times. Now I'm writing this feeling nauseated. One star is for the management and my servers."}
{"text":"So I FINALLY got to eat here.... We were on the Westside of town and so we decided to drop in... We had a late lunch earlier so we weren't extremely hungry.

We went on a Sunday at 615- so right after mall closed. There were no available seats inside so we sat in the exterior seating which is in the mall.

Our service was ridiculous. Took forever for everything and it wasn't even that basin our section.

I ordered a drink (typhoon) it was mostly juice and cute fruit. I was surprised to see it was $10.50 when the bill got there. My husband and son both ordered a slice of cheesecake. Then my other son ordered kids pasta....

I ordered the buffalo chicken blasts- they were good, once I finally got the ranch I asked for instead of blue cheese when I ordered it.

The bill was over $50, so id say it was definitely steep. Our service was a 3.5 on a scale 1-10.... Yea not great."}
{"text":"I love the Hibachi steak on the menu.  I usually have a good meal here and it is a very nice restaurant.  I wish the menu was smaller so I would not have to read through the 10 to 20 pages of selection. 

Overall, great location, plenty of menu options that can be rated good, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This cheesecake factory was nice I guess I'm used to the cheesecake factory is in LA where it's a little bit bigger and the service is a little faster but the food was good overall"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times.  I love the food, ambiance and service.  This visit though, the food took too long to come.  With a 4 year old, this is an issue."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  In fact, this is where my wife and I had our first date.  Always a positive experience."}
{"text":"Eh, just eh. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, I think they are too cookie cutter. Upon arrival, we had to wait 20 min for a table on a Wednesday evening at 8pm, strange I thought. We were seated at our booth and waited. We probably waited for a good 10-12 min before the server approached us. We ordered everything at once since we didn't want to keep waiting. 

2 dirty martini's and a cosmo arrived to our table shortly after. Followed by our skinnylicious appetizers. Everything we had was OK. Nothing too bad but nothing too great either. 

Their cheesecake on the other hand was delicious. I would just go back for the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Service and lunch really good. Tried the Hazelnut Cheesecake...the best part was the whipped cream.  It wasn't good at all. The cookie layer way too soft and the Hazelnut crunch? Nowhere to be found. Very disappointed that's how I ended my great meal."}
{"text":"my self and a few friends went the cheesecake factory on 12/29/17  I checked in around 640 and was told it would be an hour an 20 min which was fine. waiting on my party to arrive so after waiting and waiting yes the lobby was very crowded people every where . so after waiting for about 2 hours I went to desk and ask how much longer on my party and she said 15 mins more the buzzer finally went off . we were seated got drinks and finally food which the appetizers we order were sooooooo salty the buffalo blast which are my favorite .but this time were a let down to look salty the food we ordered came and everything my friends order was to salty and we really did not enjoy the food I will never return to this restaurant again I will go next door to maggiano. the food is too salty my friend left there with a blood pressure head ache. finally left the restaurant at 10 a total waste of time. stay away"}
{"text":"It didn't take long to be seated (wasn't very busy in there at all) but it took over an hour to receive our cold lunch plates. I had no idea it took that long to assemble a turkey sandwich and a salad. The staff was unapologetic as tables sat down after us and received their food before us. I was very disappointed because I had a high opinion of the restaurant. I left feeling like I had just thrown $50 down the drain. It would take a lot of convincing for us to try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great experience at this restaurant. The server was very nice and personable. We had to been been shrimp, calamari, and bite-size crabcakes.  There is a really nice aquarium right outside of the restaurant. So, while you wait you can look at the live fish."}
{"text":"This whole experience was a struggle. When the hostess was walking us to our table I overheard a waitress look at our party of 11 and say \"oh great\". Very warm welcoming... Being the chatty gal that I am, our server informed me that it had only been open for a week so I decided to give them a hall pass. We had 2 servers for a party of 11... is that really necessary? 

Getting our drinks took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our separate checks took an eternity. What was supposed to be a quick work lunch break turned into a 2 hour meal. 3 of us ordered the same appetizer, mine came out first, then 10 mines later the second one came out with a noticeable smaller portion. I immediately notified I server (My side of the table had the competent server) and he directed the manager to come see us. The manager said he would give us another order gratis. When all the entrees came out, the 3rd appetizer came out. By the end they tried charging us for 4 appetizers. It was really just one thing after the other. And I get it, it was their first week open but it seemed like their staff had no industry experience. By the time we were heading out it was packed. I know this place is destined to do well because the Premium Outlets lack decent dining. Hopefully the staff gets better."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointing experience. In fact, the second one in a row at this location. Our food took almost an hour, did not come out all together, and two of the dishes were missing their sides. My fries came out five minutes later than the rest of my meal and my daughter still did not have her mashed potatoes, already finished with the rest of her food. The icing on the cake was the charge for the side of mashed potatoes which were in fact just a substitution for rice. My drink was empty most of the time. I had to bring this to the manager's attention and she was kind enough to take off the charge for the side of mashed potatoes which was not a side and did comp one appetizer."}
{"text":"If I can rate this a no star I would!!!! Worse customer service ever ..first we were waiting for ever for them to take our order . As we ordered our food I ordered Parmesan herb chicken and it comes with mashed potatoes and green beans I asked for corn succotash instead. We waited about 30 + for our food. Finally food came out my side of corn wasn't ready and server said just a few more minutes ... 10 minutes passed maybe even more nd nothing... finally the manager comes out and says they are all out of the corn succotash and what did I want instead .  At this time I was upset and told him to bring out fries. I didn't even eat the fries I was so upset that a busy resturant runs out of their own food. I waited about 10-15 min for our server to come out and to say they were all out. Then Our server never came back to check on us if we needed refills on our drinks . We finally got our check and I asked the server if I had to pay for the full plate since I didn't get a full plate bcz they were missing the corn and I never touched the fries. He said he would go talk to the manager about that . He offered me a free desert bcz he took for ever in helping us and he didn't check on us. He left and came back left the bill and took off really fast as we checked the bill we noticed that they charged me for the desert and then took it off. I waited for like 5 min and called him over as he was trying to avoid us. I told him to get his manager. He came out and I asked him if he was going to do something about my plate not being complete and his response was oh I already did ure taking the desert and I told him I didn't want the desert . And that the server said. He was giving us the desert bcz he didn't take care of us. And he said okay I didn't charge the corn and I told him he did bcz the plate was 17.50 and that's what I was getting charged. Then he said the corn was extra charge and I said I've never been charged extra for the corn and he said I can get the servers in trouble bcz they not charging right and I told him Ive always ordered this and have never been charged and he said o well ure lucky I dnt charge u. I told him I dnt want the cake the only reason I got it it's because the server said that was free bcz of his timing issue. He finally said he would take 5 buck off the bill. This manager was so not professional fighting w me instead of making a customer happy . I will never visit this place again. This managers name was Liam I think."}
{"text":"Our server was really nice and accommodating :) , food was served fast.. Will come back soon !"}
{"text":"The wait was pretty long, but that was expected as it was Saturday night and we didn't make reservations.  The food was fabulous.  Cheesecake was the best as usual.  I love having enough food leftover for a midnight snack!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?! My wife and I ordered 2 cheesecakes to go. The employee takes my order and prints out the receipt. My wife changes her mind on one of the slices and we politely ask if we can change it before she even sliced a cheesecake. Already the employees bad attitude began. She gave a rude look like she didn't want to do it but did anyway. I bit my tongue and shrugged it off and said thank you when we got our 2 slices for take out. We walk around the outlet mall and notice one of the slices was a lot bigger than the other.  I had always thought cheesecake slices were huge and equal portions, I guess not. My wife and I were contemplating on exchanging it for equal slices since they were the same price at $7.95. We arrive back at the cheesecake factory with only 5 to 10 minutes passing by since us leaving. I did not wan't to deal with the rude employee so I approached a manager and he had asked if everything was fine. I explained I wanted to exchange the slice for a bigger portion since they were the same price. Get our moneys worth you know... Sam the manager said once a slice leaves the place they can't exchange it but he could give a discount at 25% if we would like to purchase a bigger piece. I agreed and had already pulled my debit card and he noticed my military ID thanking me for my service. I said thank you also. At the sometime the disgruntle employee is nodding her head in disgust as if we were trying to get a free slice. I couldn't hold my tongue anymore and said this is what I had to deal with earlier. Pointed to her and told him she is rude. He said don't worry I will take care of you and you can pick a slice and we will cover it. Let me explain I did not want anything free but I called my wife over and she picked out an oreo cheesecake slice. The employee had to cut the free slice for us but was still shaking her head. This made me more furious and I started to raise my voice. During all this commotion the employee was still nodding her head the whole time I was talking to Sam. There was at least 4 separate instances she did it. Sam said he would take care of her later. He also explained he would take care of us the next time we came in. He asked if we were locals. I said yes I have been stationed at Nellis, AFB more than 11 years. I still left pissed off. I don't care about the free slice. I would have paid for better customer service. This is ridiculous for an employee to act how she did even with the manager present."}
{"text":"Had the Samoas and the dulce cheesecake and I would say it was spectacular, the beef in the Samoas was well seasons and has a crisp bite that melted into your mouth. The beverage the strawberry creamsickle was not the greatest, over powered with alcohol. The sangria was watered down with ice! But overall a great place for a first date"}
{"text":"I went here years ago when they first opened & never went back because honestly the food sucked. It was over priced & just didn't taste good. Fast forward 10 years or so, we decided to try it again. And wow what a difference. My hubby & I have been there about 3 times this year already. The food tastes amazing. Maybe since they're getting advertisement from the Big Bang theory, they stepped it up?? I dont know but I definitely recommend. Friendly servers, super clean & amazing food not to mention how good the cheesecake is. I'll be back Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Always a long wait, usually 2 hours. Service can be great or can be terrible. But most importantly, they were recently rated \"B\" in cleanliness because employees were using bare hands in food prep and service and other problems."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is da bomb!! The ambiance when I walked in was inviting and the hostess welcomed us to sit anywhere in the bar area. We figured it'd be a lengthy wait on a Sunday during brunch but we were pleased to sit down at a high top right away. Our server John was excellent! He kept our glasses full and bread on the table. 

I ordered the Breakfast Burrito that stuffed me half way through. My date ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs with potatoes and bacon on a plate the size of Texas. Everything was amazing and we offered cheesecake to go of course. 

I can't wait to go back next Sunday for brunch with more friends!"}
{"text":"I always liked Cheese Cake Factory, but never loved it.  The food is good and reasonably priced, and service usually very good.  But for some reason I don't comprehend why it's always busy... esp on a Sunday night like last night with over 20 people waiting while all the tables were still full as we left.  I had the BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potato fries.  There was a bit too much sauce, but the cole slaw helped tame the OD of sassy richness.  Overall, I give my meal last night \"thumbs up\".  Any cheesecake for dessert is a must with a multitude of selections to choose from.  Peace!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing server named Justin and it just so happened to be his birthday when we went in. He was great, but the food. Uh uh. Cooks need to regroup. My shrimp and garlic with a touch of marinara was no where close to that. Shrimp was over cooked TWICE, like rubber. And it wasn't a touch of marinara it was like a lotta marinara. Even though the manager came by, he was quick about how everything came out then off he went. Just a courtesy stop I guess to make me feel better but wasn't interested in details. Oh well. Last time @ any Cheesecake Factory for me. Sorry."}
{"text":"I almost hate to give The Cheesecake Factory four stars, only becasue it's a chain. 

The food isn't that bad and we had a great server, otherwise it would be three stars. She knew everything on the menu by heart and for those of you who haven't been there, it's a huge menu to know. It was easy to make substitutions and the timing was perfect. Could the food have been better, yes but service is a big part of it too!

My partner and I were hungry, didn't know what we wanted, didn't have much in the fridge due to my travel schedule and wanted something close to home. I suggested The Cheesecake Factory and he said \"I was just thinking about that\" so off we went. There wasn't a wait (another big plus) and the service as mentionioned above was just right.

All in all a good experience. I wouldn't go there on a busy weekend night where I had to wait to eat here, it wouldn't be worth it."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is always a great place to come for happy hour.  The selection is great and the prices are reasonable. This occasion we decided to do well drinks. Vodka and cranberry juice. One was more than enough. Our bartender also took our order as we sat at the bar and ate.  We asked for bread prior to our appetizers and it was served warm and was really good too. The appetizers were delicious. My friend got the happy hour burger which was a normal sized burger and not slider size. I had the fried zucchini which came with a ranch dipping sauce. I am not a fan of ranch but this was really good. No cheesecake this time."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has an awesome happy hour. The menu is limited which is usually the case for happy hour but the choices are really good. Oh and the drinks....Really good. There were three of us so we decided we'd order three appetizers between us. We got cheeseburger sliders, nachos, and Vietnamese shrimp spring rolls. Everything was delicious and our waitress also brought us out the signature bread and butter. So good. For drinks we had mojitos and Long Island ice teas. Both delicious. Atmosphere is great. I love your happy hour Cheesecake Factory. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"You know sometimes its not always about the food but about the customer service.  I wanted to give Cheesecake Factory a huge shout out for an amazing dining experience on a Saturday evening.  I came in stressed that my party of seventeen wouldn't be able to get seating.  I was greeted by the manager who took it upon herself to find two potential tables for me and to let me know about how soon those tables would clear for my party.  Just as she said the table I had decided upon was cleared and ready when all of my friends arrived.  I don't remember the waitresses name unfortunately, but she was awesome.  We were greeted right as we were seated and given bread.  The menus were already at the table waiting for us.  Soon after she took our drink order and then dinner requests.  The food came out in a very timely manner and temperature of the food was perfect.  Once we were done with our dinner, the table was cleared and we were given dessert menus.  Something I need to highlight, our waitress made sure to tell us before we ordered dessert what items were no longer available.  Such forward thinking on her part and the restaurant.  All of our requested desserts came without delay.  When it was time for the checks (we were asked when we were seated if the checks would all be separate), all were received and given to all the right people.  This kind of service should be applauded.  Thanks Cheesecake factory and my amazing server for an awesome experience."}
{"text":"I always like the food in this place. I am literally typing this feedback while waiting for our food. Reason is I just find it unacceptable for a server to frown at the table she is serving, just because they maybe kinda confused her with some questions, and also when she turned around I just saw her say or whispered the F word to herself! Wow! We were seated at the patio and the lady server has white colored hair. The table she is serving is beside us. Just surprised about this."}
{"text":"I get out to Henderson about once a month. On every trip I always come here. I have never had a bad meal at Cheesecake Factory and have been coming to multiple locations ever since the chain opened. My favorite dish is a toss up between the Chicken Madeira and the Shrimp Scampi. Imagine my delight when they started the combination meal so I can get both. I love the brunch menu. The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are the best and the bacon is perfect. My favorite appetizers are the fried zucchini, Dynamite Shrimp, and the new pork belly sliders. Love the bread of course.

Make the fried pickles a separate appetizer please! Love 'em!!!

Love every cheesecake I've ever tried.

Service has always been very good, especially in Henderson. They really hustle here without seeming to be rushed. The servers are very nice."}
{"text":"Yup the beloved and popular American eatery finally arrived at Toronto's Yorkdale mall. There's very long lineups in the mall just to get an alarm coaster to tell you that it's your time to dine. The lineups used to be more more than three hours but after two months in operations(and efficiency) your wait time is a bit over two hours now even on a Saturday. Tip: lineup starts infront of Victoria Secret store. Lineup from  inside don't go through their main doors since you'll be eventually redirected to that lineup in the mall. It will save you a good 10-20 minutes of trying to find the real lineup. The good: very family oriented with over 200 different meals. We got red wine, of course, with my bow  tie pesto meal and sea food angel hair pasta Bolognese. You don't leave  here without getting their  cheesecake- we tried salted caramel and raspberry. The bad: The wait.The ugly: these cakes cost nearly $10 a slice!! Some meals offer lunch or dinner portions(which are larger portions).you pay for atmosphere. You can get better meals elsewhere  without the wait. There's always a Cheesecake Factory in Buffalo. No wait there. $$$"}
{"text":"We ordered carside to go. My husband and I both ordered the cheese steak. Both breads were burned and very hard like they were stale. The steak was very chewy. Stay away in regards to the food. Def not worth the money."}
{"text":"Seems like this place is always packed, no matter the date or time. Staff is always friendly and the kitchen is accommodating. My favorite item here is the fried mac and cheese. My favorite cheesecake is the Snickers variety. I also really enjoyed the fudge cake."}
{"text":"Terrible. Not worth the wait and food is salty and poor quality unless you eat a burger or fried foods. 
Just come for the cheesecake if the price doesn't turn you off.

We won't Be visiting here again, not worth the money.

I hope this review stays on Yelp. I hear a rumour that restaurants can pay to remove bad reviews...."}
{"text":"Great experience today with the food and service. Chilaquiles are only served in Sunday when they offer brunch. Chilaquiles were way better than expected. The fried mac and cheese always delivers. Our waitress, Ashley M, was awesome. Friendly, efficient and didn't over/under check in on us. For dessert, we ordered the hazelnut crunch cheesecake and Linda's Chocolate cake. Both awesome. Linda's Chocolate cake is extremely rich (good thing)."}
{"text":"took my wife there for a date night. it was great. great food, great service, prices a little high but it is completely worth it, plus we got to go downtown. food was amazing and the desert was the best i have ever had."}
{"text":"Lemme just start off by saying that I've given this place 5 (yes five) seperate chances..  busy hours will give you poor service and poor quality food because the kitchen is just pushing orders out.  The menu is too large and it's obvious they do not \"specialize\" in a certain type of food besides cheesecake.  Wine selection is awesome.  The portions are \"American-ized\", I wish for quality not quantity, we are becoming too obese because of places like this...  Every one that I've visited has been very nicely decorated with great ambience if you just want desert and some wine I'd say stop by.. Let me just say so people dont hate on me, I tried all the dishes that were supposed to be \"the best\", this place blows donkey balls"}
{"text":"I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory chain and I think they must have a secret record for the largest menu in a chain restaurant.  

There isn't much you can't get here and there is something for everyone.  Chicken, steaks, seafood, burgers(which are incredible), pasta, Mexican and the list goes on and on.  

The best part is their huge range of desserts and cheesecakes.  I can't remember the exact number but there are 20 or so flavors of Cheesecake with each sounding better than the last.  They also have ice cream and lots of other desserts.  

My latest visit was for a party of 8 and we had a wonderful time.  I didn't mention the drinks but they do have a nice wine selection, a full menu of mixed drinks unique to their franchise and of course they can make you a cocktail of choice. 

If you want a great restaurant with awesome desserts, be certain to stop here."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love this company. No matter where you go in the US this brand is consistently giving their all to customer service. There's always a little wait but the food is phenomenal and the variety of all the items on the menu is awesome! There's something in it for everyone."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for about 4 years now. Our last meal has much smaller portions of food. Burnt potatoes. This price has gone up and the portions are noticeably smaller. Thinking we will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Oh how I love thee..... I love me some cheese cake factory, if I'm in a major city I'm going to this place. Hands down. They never ever disappoint and it's my tradition to always take a banana cream cheesecake to go. 

The plate portions are huge and you'll always have left overs. Well unless you're super hungry and eat it all.

I typically stick to two dishes, the Chicken Madeira is to die for. It's a chicken breast that is pounded into a thin portion, mozzarella cheese is baked on top. The Madeira wine sauce is to die for. It's served with asparagus this is super amazing! The mushrooms are in the sauce it's a perfect dish. 

If I'm not in a mood for something heavy, I go for the salmon. 

These are my top faves. However the jambalaya is a good one, the shrimp dishes are amazing, as is the brunch items.

Seriously everything is good. I'm especially an addict of their delicious wheat bread! Yes it's complimentary and you can ask for as much as you wish!!! 

Get a cheesecake, you'll thank me later. 

Expensive, no not for the quality! Worth every single penny your inner fat God will thank you!"}
{"text":"As we had a $50 gift certificate and decided to use it for Dinner on our Anniversary a few weeks ago. We arrived for early dinner on Sunday evening, the wait wasn't long about 10 mins so we got a glass of wine at the bar while we waited.  We got seated on the patio shortly after but we ended up leaving the restaurant after waiting 25 mins for a server to attend our table.  During this time neither of the two servers working the patio made eye contract with us. Eventually the servers busily joined tables near to us to accommodate a party of 5, as soon as the party were seated the server attended their table, we got up and left.  On the way out we stopped by hostess stand to ask to speak to a manager, at first the hostess' saw us but turned back and continued their conversation, eventually we got their attention and spoke to the Manager whose name was Robert.  I explained what happened and he apologized, didn't offer to make up for the poor service and could only say sorry.... This isn't acceptable....  

We returned this evening for dinner for a friends Birthday, Cheesecake Factory was their choice not ours!  Since we still had the $50 gilft card to use we agreed to go...  This time things were a little smoother although while checking in we didn't get asked for our preference of seating.  I ordered dinner and asked for half to be boxed before bringing my plate out, the server said that would be fine.  When my food arrived it looked like a really big portion... I was disappointed my dinner hadn't been split as I requested.  The server stopped by and said she will bring my boxed portion out later.  Great I thought as the portion I had was quite generous.  As I was finishing my dinner the server came back with my to go box, it contained half a portion of rice.... no chicken or shrimp...  Unbelievable! why would she think I that I wanted to take half a portion of rice home... besides rice is the last thing that you want to take home in a togo box as it can harbor bacterial really fast if not refrigerated right away or when not heated up properly...  

Really disappointing! will not be going back!  There are tons of great restaurants around, no need to spend money here and be disappointed."}

{"text":"Fantastic food!! From the Skinny Menu I tried the margarita on the rocks which was terrific & the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, which I loved. It was very flavorful and delicious. I have never been disappointed at Cheesecake Factory, you can not go wrong with anything you choose!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been talking about this \"amazing\" French toast he had at the Cheesecake Factory when he ate there with his family, so we finally made it over there for Sunday brunch. I ordered the Bruleed French Toast and he ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs, scrambled/well, with potatoes, toast, and bacon (meat is extra). We planned to share so we could have a little of everything. I was surprised that they brought out the complimentary bread before our brunch, but it was almost lunchtime. I sure do enjoy the honey oat bread. Sourdough is alright too.
When our food came out, I took a bite of the French toast and was instantly turned off by the mushy consistency. It's so thick and, I'm sure, soaked in egg. It was not appetizing to me. My boyfriend offered to switch plates since he'd had it before and liked it, so we did. The eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them. Most of the potatoes were crunchy, so I was not impressed. The bacon was really dark red in color and very crispy. I don't know if that means it is extra lean?? The toast was really not necessary after all the bread I had just eaten...
Overall I was not pleased with this meal, especially for the price! And I had a stomach ache afterwards. There are so many other places I'd prefer to get breakfast food. Our server did not really have a sense of humor either.
We did get a couple slices of cheesecake to go, for good measure. Vanilla Bean and Lemon Meringue. Unfortunately the meringue had melted off the top by the time we got it home... The vanilla bean tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream. So it was good, but even half a slice was too much. The lemon meringue was rather tart but the whipped cream helped to balance it out. I've enjoyed other varieties of cheesecake more than these two."}
{"text":"The ambiance is the best I have ever seen at a restaurant. The burgers are really good. I get them every time. Also, I am diabetic. They make a low-carb cheese cake made with splenda. I can have cheesecake here! That gets it a 5 by itself. 

One of our visit we got a really horrible server. We sent an appetizer back because we misunderstood what it was. After that she transferred us to another waitress. By that time we had already been waiting for our food for 45 minutes and by the time we got it, it was all wrong.  So why the positive review? This was an isolated incident. AND the manager comped the entire meal and gave us free deserts. So yeah, they still rock."}
{"text":"Let's talk about how I never leave bad reviews unless it's the server.... lol well yeah that happened tonight. 

Service was great till I ordered my turkey burger add grilled mushroom, no tomato. When I decided to put my \"lettuce\" on the burger, I noticed how bitter my burger was. I looked harder at the lettuce. It was actually cabbage!! I couldn't believe I was eating cabbage on half of my burger lol. Anyways, I take it off the burger and continue to eat. At the end when the server took my plate, I asked if that burger is supposed to have cabbage?? She said it's supposed to be a mix. I said weird it says LTO on the menu, I've ordered this 3-4 times before. She couldn't resist that this dish was suppose to still have a mix and maybe they forgot the lettuce. I just told her maybe she should look into it. Got the check and still tipped 20%"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time!!!! Wonderful food and the best waiter I have ever had!!! Thank you for making our trip down so great Mr. Blue!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This visit I ordered the veggie burger and the side salad. The veggie burger has a really good taste to it. It's made out of black beans and rice and It comes with lettuce tomato onion and pickles on it. I added mushrooms because I put them on everything as well it came with a piece of cheese. The only thing about the burger is that it breaks apart easily. The salad is really fresh and comes with pieces of tomato and I believe little peppers. The balsamic that they toss it with is very VERY light. Just tasted like wet lettuce. I still have them a 4 Star because they normally have excellent food."}
{"text":"Our server was spectacular but I didn't get his name. We went in thinking appetizer, dinner, and dessert but once we saw the appetizers we changed our plans. We ordered 3 apps and dessert. Everything was delicious and it was more than enough food."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel like their food is mediocre and overpriced. That being said, this newly opened restaurant at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is a welcome addition. Dining options at the outlets have always been severely limited and kind of atrocious. It's nice to have a sit-down option instead of eating at the food court. 

PRO TIP: Make sure to enter through the front entrance near the street, otherwise you'll walk in on the side like we did and be confused as to where the hostess stand is located. 

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Served with softened butter that spread easily on the bread. Love when that happens. 4/5

FRIED ZUCCHINI ($4.95): Served with a side of ranch. Came with maybe 8 pieces of zucchini. Delicious. 4/5

LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA ($16.95): Our waiter said this dish was very popular. My husband and I split this dish and ordered the chicken on the side. More than enough food for two people! I don't understand how they serve this huge bowl of pasta to one individual. Unfortunately, the dish wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and could have used a bigger helping of veggies. 2/5 

SERVICE: Waiter was great. He was super cool about accommodating a picky vegetarian eater (me). Hostess was super friendly and we were sat at a booth on a Monday night with no wait time. 4/5  

VIBE: Modern cafe with a tan and brown color palette. Very family friendly. 3/5 

GOOD TO KNOW: If you fill out the feedback survey on your receipt, you get a $10 e-gift card good on your next visit. :)

Worth a Return Visit?
Subtotal was about $27 for one entree and one small appetizer. Prices add up quickly here. We ate here because we were starving and didn't have a lot of dining options available to us. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, only as a last resort kind of thing.

{"text":"My family and I came to this location to celebrate my birthday. I thought it would be a fun celebration with good food but the service was absolutely horrendous. Not only did our server disappear, we had to wait for a whole hour before our food was served. For that whole hour we were also ignored and asked for a bucket of ice for our bottle of wine, which came. We then tried to wait to see if she had said anything to the manger but we realized that she hadn't. So we reached out to the manager about everyone around us were served and leaving before we got served. But the manage handed our check off to another server who never brought it back to the table. Finally we decided to head to the hostess stand to find where our check went. So bottom line, it was horrible service and the management/servers/kitchen was extremely unprofessional and we will not be going there ever again."}
{"text":"Food here is always delicious. I got two different types of cakes and the red velvet cheesecake. It was delicious. However, servers behind the counter ignored me while they were gossiping on the other side of the counter. I almost left had it not been for my parents. It was very rude that they kept me waiting while there were three servers on the other side just talking their heads off. With this hopefully they would be more attentive to customers!"}
{"text":"We both enjoyed our starters, which were the Crispy taquitos and the Avocado eggrolls! YUM! 

I had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, which was good. The plantains were great! Crispy and spicy on the outside and smooth and creamy inside! My companion had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, but he ordered it with brown rice instead. He didn't like it so much. There was too much rice! 

Our server lacked enthusiasm and was sub par really. 

We got cheesecake to go. I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee and he had the Oreo. Both were creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"MOST RUDE RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES AT THE DISTRICT. First, I called to make an order for pick up and I was put on hold for 12 minutes until I hung up and called again. The second time I was hung up on. The third time I spoke to the manager, Ashley(?), and she was abrupt rude and acted as if I was an inconvenience for calling. She transferred me to make the order and the girl who tried to take the order was rude as well. I gave up on calling AS YOU COULD IMAGINE! I love cheesecake factory but this one is just a complete mess. Saving you a trip, people!! I went to Sammy's Restaurant down the street instead and it was great(:"}
{"text":"We are visiting Las Vegas for my sisters birthday and decided to go to my favorite restaurant back home and celebrate. Why did we go here, Chris the waiter is rude and is unhappy with his job. We were treated so cold. He was glaring at us and purposely slow with service the whole time. I'm sorry he was not pleased with us just on sight for no reason( we are black), but I left him a nice tip anyway hoping he will treat the next group with respect. ( Beware folks never again)!!"}
{"text":"Usually not a fan of franchise food, but I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad with the dressing on the side and it rocked.   The salad must've weighed like 2-3 pounds.  I know defeats the purpose of ordering a salad, but you know what...F U.  I was hungry...haha.  Plus our waitress was super cool as she was originally from Chicago and NYC, and shared city stories,. ..not too crowded and decent prices."}
{"text":"I don't know what some people are looking for but ... We were here on a Monday at lunch and the service was top notch, the food was to die for and the decor was out of this world! We shared the skinny Turkey and Avocado sandwich which came with a wonderful mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was fab.

This is the second location I've been to. The first time was in Raleigh, NC and great food and service there too!

Some people just need to chill and not be so demanding."}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory is a decent place but the food is kind of bland depending on what you order. They have eveything you could ever want to order, however the menu is so big you just end up picking something random. The menu is leterally about 20 pages long back to front and its so overwhelming when all you want to do is eat dinner. Suprisingly enough there dessert menu(completley different, this one only about six page long) had every kind of desert except cheese cake. For being a cheesecake factory you'd think there would be more options for cheesecake. Its a great restaurant to visit once just to day youve been there, but I would prefer to go somewhere else from now one."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here tonight-12/27 around 7 pm.  My youngest son's food did not arrive until we had almost completed eating our meals.  The waiter, Blue had said they overcooked my son's cheeses teak (without onions or mushrooms ). No visit by the manager and our food took 30 minutes to arrive anyhow!  Food quality is dropping rapidly too;  I ordered the chicken Maderia.  It came with two asparagus. Three weeks ago there were at least eight. We will not return to this location.  Also, the health inspection score is low at 94.5.  Never again!"}

{"text":"This restaurant was the savior during our trip to Vegas. The food is outstanding (lots of it) and reasonably priced as are the drinks. There's something for everyone - all the other restaurants in and around the Strip are designed to rip you off and they serve mediocre food but not the Cheesecake Factory. Well done and thank you!"}
{"text":"I would say I really love Cheesecake, we dine there every month in the past few years. 

The service is horrible, slow and un careing.
Servers don't even work for their tips, they just run around with 0 thinking and logistics. 

The fail to listen, serve and provide service, 

Food was lacking in the last few times, waiting time for the food is long, when mistakes happens they just take your food away and you have to decide if you want want to eat low quality food or finish your evening with no food."}
{"text":"Okay food but horrible service by rude and cynical waitress. In less than an hour the waitress managed to deride both my husband and me multiple times but she topped it when she withdrew my husband's plate and asked if he wanted to have it packed. I was just starting to eat my lunch and she is already removing plates and thinking about packing leftovers for us?  At the end of our lunch I reminded her that it is not in good form to withdraw one person's plate and ask about taking it home before his companion is finished. She asserted that she was following her bosses' instructions. Again, I said that it is not in good form. She then asked, \"where are you from.\" Really? Don't sit at Jessica M's table if you want proper service. Better yet, stay away if their managers support rude waitresses behaviors."}
{"text":"6/9/2018 5-7pm

The lobby and outside was packed with people waiting and the wait for two was only 15-25 Min. 

Service: Exceptional! A lot of reviews state their service was poor but our waitress Hillary or Mallory was great! Recommended the Chicken Bellagio and Mexican lettuce tacos which were delicious!

Food: The lettuce tacos, chicken bellagio, shrimp and salmon dish, and Chris' cocunut cheesecake left us full wanting more! The portions were massive, should have split but now have a meal for tomorrow. 

Cost: I have attached the receipt you decide if its appropriate."}
{"text":"The worst rib eye steak I have ever had. Seriously disappointed. I ordered a medium rare rib eye and got the complete opposite."}

Very clean and great service."}

{"text":"Today, I ordered some fish tacos from Cheesecake Factory and I used their curb-side pickup service.  The service was prompt when I called and when I picked up the food.  They were pretty quick about getting my food out to me as I called one hour in advance.

The fish tacos were average or below average.  I really disliked the texture of the tortillas.  Actually, I don't think they were even tortillas.  I'm not sure what they were, but they were not the fresh, steaming hot tortillas that I know and love.  Taco Bell serves them too, but I still do not know what they are.  They're moist and a little bit squishy with very little flavor.

Anyway, I didn't detect fish in the tacos at all when I bit into them.  I added some black beans and rice to each taco, and apparently, I was able to smother the puny fish, which I did not taste at all.  The flavor wasn't that great.  The cilantro did help a little though.

Normally, I would expect nothing but excellent food from the Cheesecake Factory, but now, I don't know.  All the other times I have eaten here, I have been delighted by the portion, but this meal wasn't nearly as good as past meals.  

I will not order the fish tacos here ever again unless they overhaul them.  It was a filling meal, nonetheless."}
{"text":"So this will be the second time I've had an issue with bugs at this Cheesecake Factory location. The one star was only for the food b/c I really enjoy most Cheesecake Factory locations and I can't post without at least one star..The additional \" inside\" seating area that has large opening around the front of the restaurant seems to be suffering from this problem the most. Small insects in the salt shakers with flies tasting your food. As for tonight when I clearly stated I didn't want to sit in that area I was directed to the outside/Inside area again.. I was told I would be put at the end of the seating list and would have a long wait if I refused the table, even with my complaint of my last visit the young hostess continued to seat us in the area stating it wasn't outdoors. To sum it all up I ended up being seated directly against the opening to  the outside with bugs crawling on the back seat cushions and spiders on the sides while my food was being served..! Needless to say I don't think I'll be back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"YES IT'S WORTH IT!
Went to The Cheesecake Factory for my birthday and cannot speak on the wait time because I got lucky... Regardless IM SURE ITS WORTH THE WAIT! Got seated by the bar, which actually isn't so bad at this restaurant. Our server Sean was great and so was the other bar staff. 
Ordered the following:
1. Cheeseburger Springrolls - 5/5 Amazing, must try! Although on the greasy side... tasted like a deep friend Big Mac
2. Spinach Dip - 2/5 A bit disappointing. The dip was flavourless, but maybe its because we ate the spring rolls first so our palette was expecting much more lol
3. Four cheese pasta with chicken - 4/5 Nice flavour, pasta cooked nicely al dente
4. Chicken parm 'pizza' pasta - 5/5 Looks amazing, I almost thought it was a pizza... crazy over the top. It was HUGE... also tasted really good except by this time I was super full and wanted space for cheesecake - they gave me a special big box to pack it home in
5. Chris Outrageous Cheesecake - 5/5 For all coconut lovers, this is your flavour!
Overall, a wonderful first experience and would def come back. The manager was super nice and made my birthday a lot better. Bar staff were super friendly, down to earth and knowledgeable. They were honest about what they've tried and havent tried, the restaurant is fairly new after all. Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm always weary coming to a place that has disappointed me in the past but it was years ago and it is much approved since, but the service from Skyler tonight was awesome made our experience amazing!"}
{"text":"Being a chain restaurant I would say this place is definitely consistent with other locations I've been to.  Large menu with tons of variety you are sure to find something that will suit your fancy. Some would say a bit overpriced, but portions are sized to match in my opinion.  My family loves the \"brown bread\" and we have found that the servers will gladly bring you a basket with just the bread of your liking.

What I liked about this location was the waiting process. When you approach the host stand if there is going to be a wait they hand you a card and tell you to come back after X minutes from the time written on the card (which is the time you first check in). This gives you time to wander and shop.  In my experience, upon your return they are able to seat you pretty much immediately. If a table comes up before the noted wait time then they will call out your name, but if you happen to not hear or you are in another shop no worry."}
{"text":"While in town I wanted to treat my mother to a lovely dinner because she had never dined at this franchise before. I had been years earlier with friends of mine and I said that time I had to have my mother try this place as well. I told her she would be in store for a great treat and that's what she got.

As we entered this place to put our name the list for a table, the line was out the door and there were many patrons sitting outside in the nice sitting area for there name to be called as well. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table. That was fine since we didn't have anywhere in particular to go this Saturday afternoon. 

The 30 minutes came and went fast by us people watching others going in and coming out of the mall. Once we turned in our buzzer it was still a 5 minute wait to get seated still. We finally were placed in a busy, small corner of the restaurant by the hostess. This was cool because it was just 2 of us and enough space for both of us.

Our waitress came and introduced herself within minutes of us sitting down. We looked over the menu for awhile. After bringing our drinks the waitress informed us that she was leaving for the day and another waitress would handled us from here on out. This was fine as long as we still got top notch service.

The menu was filled with all kinds of things, chicken, pasta, hamburgers, and things like that. I had a very hard trying to choose what I wanted to eat. It was either the Parmesan chicken or the Seafood pasta. I ended up choosing the chicken and my mother chose the 'glamburger'. Both were great choices. My dish came with 3 chicken breasts, green beans, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were out of this world!!!!! They were absolutely amazing. The chicken and green beans were good but I couldn't get enough of the potatoes. My mother enjoyed her hamburger and fries. It was a pretty big burger too. We both had tons to take home. 

Then came the dessert!!! How could you go to this restaurant and not order cheesecake?!?!?!?!?!? I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but I do love a Strawberry cheesecake and that's what I got and my mother ordered the Key Lime cheesecake. Only complaint I have about my cheesecake is the bottom crust. I didn't particularly care of it but the rest was delicious.

My mother really enjoyed this little dinner we had!!! I'm so glad that I was able to have her dine here with me for the first time!!! I'm sure this won't be her last because she is now HOOKED!!!! I'm sure she would want me to take care of the tab again also!!!! LOL!!!!"}
{"text":"We live down the street and come here often. Always love the food. Service is sometimes good. Sometimes great. The other night GREAT. Our server was David L. We've never been served by him before. I myself am a server and I take pride in providing great service. He was very prompt and polite. And his order timing was perfect. I accidentally spilled a few drops of sauce on my shirt and used my napkin with water to get it off. Before I know it he pops around the corner with some soda water for me. Wonderful. I will be sure to ask for him next time we go."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of their food, but their cheesecake is amazing. Maybe I order the wrong thing? 

LOVE the Oreo cheesecake."}
{"text":"Came in to get a whole cheesecake to go for the husband's birthday- our favorite! Bakery staff was extremely helpful and nice. Didn't discover until after we got home that we got the wrong cheesecake- one we haven't had before. It's too far out of the way to return and we haven't not liked a flavor before so we decided to try it- delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there because I wanted some really good fried catfish.  Having lived in southern Missouri before moving to Wisconsin over a year ago, I have been looking for a good catfish dinner.  When I saw \"Southern Fried Catfish, Farm Raised, Lightly Breaded and Fried Crisp\", listed on The Cheesecake Factory's menu, I couldn't wait to go try it.  Well, I can tell you it is nothing at all like real Southern Fried Catfish - I'd give it a 1 compared to real Southern Fried Catfish a 10.  It was in 3 chunk pieces and not lightly breaded, but heavy corn meal fried dark brown, and the fish wasn't done in the middle, because it didn't \"flake\" when you tried to cut it.  I actually took most of it home to finish cooking it properly because I didn't want to eat fish that was not fully cooked (fried), and we never send food back to be fixed, because of what might happen to it back in the kitchen. The mashed potatoes were good, but the green beans were almost raw and the corn was pretty dry. This meal was definitely not worth $17.95.  And, please don't think their \"Southern Fried Catfish\" is anything like the real thing because it isn't.  I guess you have to go south to get the really good, pond raised, catfish, sliced in long pieces, lightly breaded and fried to a light golden brown - it is so good!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night for dinner. We waited 1.5hours to be seated we sat down around 11:30pm. Our server was nice and upbeat which was a plus. We knew it would probably take awhile for our food to come so we ordered our drinks 2kids meals and 1 appetizer (calamari) my son is a picky eater and he loves calamari so everywhere we go we always order calamari. It took 15minutes to get 2 cokes and another 10 to get orange juice, blood orange margarita and they forgot about my daughters strawberry lemonade. While he served drinks we ordered our mains we ordered filet mignon and the factory meat combinations (steak Diane, shrimp scampi) and a side order of grilled asparagus. 25 minutes for drinks and still no food. Shortly after the kids meals arrive.. but still no appetizer... kids finished their food and by this time we were so tired and of waiting we weren't even hungry anymore.. 10 minutes pass 15 minutes we were ready to go and then boom our food comes but with no sign of our side asparagus and still no appetizer calamari. When we finished our meals that's when our side asparagus came sooo annoying!!! The food did taste good I'll give them the star for that.  But we waited waaay too long for food that we were just completely turned off. When we got our food my 10year old kept bugging me to order her cheesecake because she was afraid it wouldn't come for another 30minutes. We did and our server informed us that the cheesecake was on the house because our food took too long. When the server came back  with the appetizer calamari I wanted to tell him that we no longer wanted the calamari but my poor son still wanted it so we kept it but it was still on our bill. We ordered another cheesecake to go and asked for our bill. We understand that it wasn't the servers fault that our food was late and they still have a huge tip out at the end of the night  so we still tipped him  a little more than 20% but he never said bye. Probably because he thought we weren't gonna tip him. Needless to say if our food came at a reasonable time we probably would've had an amazing experience. But sadly no and sadly we won't be returning."}
{"text":"The wait for this place is still 2 hrs even though it's been open for 3 months already. If that isn't enough, when you actually get in, you get told that they're out of brown bread. This was half the reason why we went in the first place. We were also told that they were out of the Louisana chicken pasta but it ended up being false alarm. I'm not sure if it actually was though because the pasta tasted and looked nothing like the original louisana pasta that I've had twice before. It was good, but definitely questionable on whether we were served what we ordered which is ridiculous. We also received our drinks after we finished eating our main course which I found completely unacceptable. These people are so disorganized, needs better management for sure. This review would have been 1 star if it weren't for the food being so good...even if it wasn't what we ordered."}
{"text":"When I stumbled into The Cheesecake Factory while checking out the shops inside The Forum Shops at Caesars, all I could think about was Penny and the guys from The Big Bang Theory. I abso-freakin-lutely love this show so you can imagine how stoked I was to find this place. 

Nothing else mattered at that moment... I had to try it!

I went there twice and loved it both times. The First time was for dinner (and dessert as well merci beaucoup!) - I had their kobe burger w/ fries and it was pretty good. For dessert, I had their original cheesecake w/ Graham Cracker Crust and Sour Cream topping.... So good!

The second I went was in sometime in the morning and all I wanted was another cheesecake so I sat down and said to the waiter: \"Cheesecake please..\" He recommended the Vanilla Bean cheesecake so I went with that and it was amazing!

I wish we had one in Melbourne.. I really like it - the staff are very nice, I like the setup (nothing too formal nor too casual). It's a great place to chill and the price is quite reasonable too... I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came for dinner around 6pm in a Friday. We expected to wait, but was seated pretty quickly!

Service
Our server was wonderful. He came to greet us, dropped menus, and got our drink orders. When we were ready to order, he was quick and repeated the order perfectly. I really liked that he came around frequently to refill drinks and clear empty plates.

Food
We ordered Calamari, Crispy Crab Cakes, Zucchini Fries as appetizers. All 3 tastes wonderful. The breading was light and crispy.

Entrée was Rib Eye Steak for me. Moderate and it was served perfectly! My husband got the Steak Diane/Medera Chicken, his was very tasty as well.

Overall our experience was wonderful. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We went on our anniversary. We go here maybe 2-3 times a year. It's not cheap,  so it's a usually a special occasion. We just went on our anniversary. Service was impeccable,  as usual. Food was delicious,  as usual. 

HOWEVER. ....we usually will order a piece of cheesecake to go. The portions are so large that we end up taking leftovers,  and dessert to go,  too enjoy later. We ordered our usual slice to share,  and one to take back for my parents to share. When we took out out later at home to enjoy,  it was miniscule. The prices  had not shrunk. But the cheesecake was about 1/4 the size it usually is. And the really disappointing part. ......the pieces being served up for consumption at the tables were normal size. So I guess they reduced ours because it was going home?  
Moral  of this review.......check your dessert  before you leave. They may need to fix it."}
{"text":"This is just an OK place.  Every time I try something new, its just OK.  I would rather they have a smaller menu and are able to focus on the taste of their food.  Cheese cake factory is always packed.  I understand if you want to come and have dessert.... But dinner?  Not good, not mind blowing.... Just some mediocre food.  

The only dish that I actually really like is the fried Mac and cheese appetizer.  
And their desserts are good.  

But the food is never worth the wait to get a table."}
{"text":"Very busy all the time, which means they have good food. The selection of Cheesecakes are over the top. The potion sizes are nice at this price point. You will never leave this place hungry.

The tropical iced tea is a great compliment or try one of their Mojito's and you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Iv been here more times then I can count but never left a review. Food wise everything  is most of the time good , service sometimes better then others. This review is for Tyler at the bakery. I order curbside to go and he is just so accommodating and nice. It was pleasant to see him in a good mood which puts a customer in a good mood. He offered me something to drink as I waited for my food. Food was well prepared and everything in my to go order was placed correctly."}
{"text":"I decided to take my wife here as this is her favorite resturant.
The wait time wasn't that bad as we could walk around in the mall for 1 hr. 
The meal I selected for my myself was the rib eye steak steak with mashed potato and veggies. My wife had the jambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken.

Prior to eating we had their brown bread with butter and the quality was great and finally received my meal.

Quality of steak: perfect quality, done exactly how I like it. Nothing to complain about.

Portion: to be honest if it wasn't for the unlimited refills of bread and water I would have needed 2 steak meals to satisfy me. So the portion is \"okay\". Not great but not bad

All in all it was good night at Cheesecake Factory..

The bad:
They only have one size for steaks. I would have liked a bigger steak.

Wait time can be a pain so it's not a place for babies or young active children as they may get bored quickly.

The Good:
Food quality is amazing.
Portion size is \"okay:
Customer service is amazing."}
{"text":"Horrible service and poor management. I had to ask for silverware a plate and given menu and had to seat myself while everyone else around me was getting seated... The server never once asked if I needs refill or if everything was ok. She took my order and that was the entire time I saw her. NEVER COME TO THIS CRAPPY DIRTY LOCATION!!!! I spoke to the manager Danny, and he's a fantastic example of Poor management."}
{"text":"This review is just for the cheesecake. My family came in to grab some to-do desserts and the people at the counter were very nice and efficient. We were able to place our orders and be out the door within 10 minutes. 

It isn't cheap, though: expect to pay at least $10/person... and probably more, depending on which varieties you select. Still, the stuff is SO good, it is worth the extra miles I'll have to run to burn it off. :/

The featured Salted Caramel Cheesecake has a blondie for its crust. Wow! If you like caramel, you should get in there this month and give it a try."}
{"text":"Worst management at a Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. Always running out of menu items, service is bad, restrooms are filthy... it's a shame considering it's location. Made the mistake of coming back a few times, won't happen again."}
{"text":"Had the most appalling service at the Madison, Wisconsin Cheesecake Factory bar this evening. My friend and I stopped in for a few cocktails and some appetizers between 7:30-8:00pm while our sons were at a Build-A-Bear birthday party in the mall--John C. was our server. There was a huge snowstorm going on outside, so the place was dead--we had the entire bar to ourselves. There was no friendly smile or hello as we sat down--John greeted us with, \"What can I get you?\" before we'd even taken our coats off or put our packages and purses down. We didn't know what we were thirsty for, so we asked for suggestions. He reluctantly offered a few, which we took. While the drinks were good, the glasses were loaded with ice...and even with that being the case, mine was still a good half inch from being a full glass. I decided not to complain, but I was finished in literally 6-8 sips. When he asked if I wanted another, I said yes, but requested that he didn't put any more ice in the glass. This time, it came back with a good inch of liquid missing. When I questioned him about it, he pointed out there was less ice this time, and when I replied that the last drink even with all the ice wasn't full, he became surly and outright rude, telling me I \"just needed to trust he was making the drink right.\" When I tried to explain I wasn't questioning the WAY he made the drink but rather HOW MUCH was in the glass each time, he proceeded to interrupt me and talk over me, not letting me finish a sentence. His poor attitude put a serious damper on our evening. My friend had ordered us some appetizers, and rather than stay, we opted to have them boxed up to go as soon as they were delivered. The bill came, and John did nothing to compensate us for his short-change on my drinks. We left upset and, frankly, feeling unfulfilled--we'd so been looking forward to a relaxing hour without the kids with some terrific food and cocktails, but honestly John C.'s lack of customer service and unfriendly demeanor really ruined it for us. We ADORE the Cheesecake Factory, having been to this and many of its other locations over the years, but this type of treatment left a very sour taste in my mouth--if I do end up returning to this location, I'll never sit at the bar again, and will closely monitor all drinks coming from there to ensure the glasses are full. Considering the price of their whiskey smashes, they should be!"}
{"text":"Parking is impossible so they provide Ameripark valet. No mention of cost. $7 for  a 45 minute lunch!  I found both Cheesecake Factory and Ameripark failed to openly and accurately describe this arrangement. I was deceived and ripped off. BEWARE!"}
{"text":"This particular location brings back the first time I ate here:

I am down with the swirl, have jungle fever, a checkerboard chick, and all other silly names people come up with to express that they are open to all types of races. I love all guys--black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, tall, short, skinny, heavy, muscular, etc. I have no specific type. If you're hot, you're hot! RIGHT?
So, one of my friends started this interracial meetup group and at the time I was NOT interested in dating. I am happiest being a loner. She talked me into accompanying her to the Cheescake Factory with the rest of the group that signed up. Now, I have enough common sense that groups like this rarely turn out the way you want because for one thing people in their 30s just don't sign up for stuff like that. 
This was a Monday evening (happy hour) and it was fairly crowded. We were waiting for the RSVP's to show up and it was starting to crowd. While waiting a few males showed up and I could tell they were NOT her type. She was looking extremely irritated and I was having a blast, watching it all go down. LOL.... This man in his late 40's showed up and without any kind of greeting she jumped up from her seat and said, \"How old are you?!\" After he reluctantly said 47, she made it clear that this group was for no one over 40. I felt bad for him as he walked away and I secretly hoped he didn't return to shoot up the restaurant.
Another male approached us wearing coke bottle glasses, a striped stained polo shirt, dirty, baggy bum jeans, and velcro snapper shoes. He looked just like Robin Williams in \"ONE HOUR PHOTO.\" To make matters worse, he was hoarding several overused Walmart bags full of personal property! Maybe he thought he was gonna get lucky and have a place to stay tonight?!

She tried to eliminate him by asking his age. He was a smart man, and he lied. Haha..... 
Out of no where, I could see her hopes rising when two extrememly tall white males entered the restaurant. The kind of lads you see posing in an Abercrombie ad. She jumped up immediately and said, \"Are you here for the meetup group?!\" They looked surprised and said no. She slumped down like she had just completely given up. Inside, I was cracking up! 

The happy hour menu is extremely cheap, nearly half off so I ordered a few appetizers. I got the calamari which is lightly breaded and extremely tender and juicy. It comes with 2 different dipping sauces, but the calamari is so good it can stand on its own with a little lemon juice. I like ordering off of their SKINNYLICIOUS menu which are items that are healthy and less calorie. The Arugula Salad containing Arugula, Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil.....is sooooooo light and refreshing and is a great accompaniment to something that is fried. 

So I sat there, watching some people make a connection and others look like they were ready to go. I chose to sit in a nuetral seat, meaning I sat between two females so that no one assumed I wanted to pair up. I wasn't there for a love connection--just a really yummy meal. This evening turned out to be hilarious--at my friends' expense. She didn't find anyone that fit her type. 
Oh well! I left with a delicious OREO COOKIE CHEESECAKE! That's the ultimate love connection!"}
{"text":"Attended a large family party here last night.  Haven't been to one of these places in years, and I was pleasantly surprised by not only the quality of the food, but the service as well!

I would highly recommend it.  Portions are ridiculously large, the service was fantastic.  For my main course, I got the chicken fettuccine alfredo and I got the lemon-raspberry cheesecake and it was unbelievably light and flavorful.

Definitely worth a trip.  It's not earth-shattering, but it's definitely a very very solid establishment."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger well done and received a cheese burger medium rare. Sent it back as it was wrong next burger comes out with no cheese which is good but the burger is still rare. Sent it back again and this time a manager comes out with the burger and said here you go I cut into it and it is still mooing at me... and the mgr decides to become argumentative with me telling me that this is well done. 
I explain that most burgers that have No pink inside is well done this has pink in it which makes it medium to medium rare.
Needless to say will not be going there again."}
{"text":"It boggles my mind that this place only has 3 1/2 stars. I have been here probably 10-15 times over the last few years, and it so rarely disappoints (and by disappoints, I mean I eat something and don't say 'this is the best thing ever'). 
I do find them a bit overpriced, and that's the only thing that keeps me from eating there weekly.
Some of my personal favorites...Cuban sandwich, crispy chicken costoletta, corn cake appetizer, firecracker salmon, orange chicken, and dinner salads are great.
My favorite cheesecakes...mango key lime, pineapple upside down, raspberry lemon, banana (I seem to be in a fruity mood right now, but there are others too!).
Basically, just top quality food and dessert. Fantastic presentation, too."}
{"text":"We go here on the regular basis. Only restaurant that I'm not afraid to try different dishes because I never get disappointed. Their ranch is amazing never had anything better. We always leave happy can't go wrong with this company!"}
{"text":"Been to many Cheesecake Factories before but not as impressed with this one. More than likely due to the poor seats we had.(avoid the tables next to the entrance. People who have been sweating in the Las Vegas heat all day line up and sit on the rail next to your face while you eat....). Food was as expected...too much but good. It was very hot and humid outside of the restaurant, next time I will ask to be seated inside. Our waiter very good and friendly. Really liked the Avocado Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get .. I went there on a Wednesday to get shrimp and they were out of my next 3 choices  .. ended up with a tuff n tasteless piece of steak in bad wine sauce  .. another big disappointment  but what's to be expected in today's world  .. pig food again people  .. boo boo boo .."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to review this place.  The service my friend and I got was excellent.  The appetizer we had (I can't remember what it was called - veggies breaded with various dipping sauces) was delicious, but they didn't have any eggplant parmesan left (that was the dish I really wanted).  So, I ordered a garlicky pasta dish.  It was tasty, but unfortunately I felt sick all night.  I know it wasn't the appetizer because the friend I dined with had no problems whatsoever.  Perhaps if I'd gotten the meal I wanted, I wouldn't have been sleepless until 5:30 am because I felt like I was going to throw up.  I've never had a bad experience at TCF before, so I'm going to view this as a fluke happenstance.  All the same, I don't intend to dine at this particular locale again."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake is of course always great. Very rich, you may want to split a slice. 

Ambiance is very decorative with elaborately painted décor. Can be casual or dressy, depending on how you want to roll. 

Crab cakes and flat breads are very good. Plenty of meat in your pasta. Overall, I have had nothing bad here. Some of the meals are average, most are good. Big Portions. Great place to split an appetizer, a meal and slice of cheesecake."}
{"text":"We love the Cheescake Factoy! I wish it was little cheaper but you do get a lot of food and normally get good service! This time we ordered crab and artichoke dip to start which was great just a little small. Then we got a cheeseburger which was tasty as ever and we got a soup, salad, and sandwich combo. There was soooo much food! The caeser salad was okay, but Ill probably just order the house salad next time. The soup was a lentil soup which wasnt my favorite and the chicken salad sandwich was fantastic! They have a pretty cool bar area!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with my mom and sister for a girls weekend.  This was our last dinner in town.  I had never been to a CF in my life.  It was a Saturday night and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our table.

Once seated, they presented us with menus that could feed an army one at a time.  I believe it was quoted to me at 30+ pages!

Our server, Steven B. made the experience phenomenal.  He's adorable, very humorous and ON IT!  By on it I mean he anticipated our every whim all the while still finding time to give other tables around good service.  He kept coming by on his way from another table to crack a joke or two.

I have never felt so welcomed at a large restaurant before.  The personalized service would have prompted me to review this place even if the food was mediocre.  Except the food wasn't mediocre.  I ordered a taco salad from the Skinnylicious menu and was shocked at the enormous size AND it was delicious.  I also sampled the Ahi appetizer which was delectable.  My mom ordered a to die for pear martini.

Thank you CF for making things such a great experience and a special thanks to Steven B. for being the ULTIMATE in service staff.  You are my hero!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience! Our server today was absolutely amazing! The food was so on point and the cheesecake always kills it. Great food, service, and pretty prompt. The only con about my visits are how loud it is and sitting so close to the table next to u."}
{"text":"I've probably been to TCF dozens of times in my life. I most recently went this past weekend on Father's day. Now there's a saying - You've been to one, you've been to them all. Quite fitting here. 
The service is the same at almost all locations - pretty good.
I'm not a big fan of the huge menu. I know TCF is a successful restaurant chain and the big menu is part of their schtick but sometimes you just need a restaurant to be great at a few things rather than just okay on a long list of things.
Plus, the endless variety of items, makes it impossible for me to narrow things down when I have no idea what I want in the first place ----but that's probably just me.

I have enjoyed their Chicken Picatta almost every visit - it's my favorite thing on the menu and it has a lunch sized-portion as well.

Their cocktail menu has many great items on it as well. Not a big fan of their standard margaritas though....

All in all, if you've been to cheesecake factory before and loved it, this location is very much on par with the rest of them. But if you have an option and it's a special occasion, I really hope that with all Las Vegas has to offer dining-wise, I hope you do your due diligence and branch out.

But hey, Cheescake Factory is A-Ok to me."}
{"text":"Just a heads up don't sit at the bar, you'll probably get ignored.  We ordered an appetizer and it wasn't bad but needed salt, the servers /bartenders were to busy cleaning and filling up containers with various juices.   So we never got the salt, drinks were empty and at this point we were no longer interested in ordering dinner despite the fact we had been waiting over 15 minutes to place our order."}
{"text":"Best G'Dang bartender in Phoenix! Attentive, talented, and kind, you are sure to have a great night with John Nagy behind the bar. Remember, tip em well, and they'll surely be good to you! Respect!--Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there the other night and have the steak Diane, an Asian pear martini and some kind of sweet corn cake appetizer. There food and service is usually very good and their menu covers pretty much any taste. There's no need to mention the cheese cake, it's excellent."}
{"text":"I waited for an hour to receive horrible service and an incorrect order ,... how do you forget to put the sides on a dish ? I do not understand? And then the rice was stale it was not soft and fluffy the way it is suppose to be made. At that point I was already starving from waiting for so long and couldn't wait any longer because my friends dishes had no issues.On top of everything the manager did not care she said I'll se what's going on with the kitchen ? What does that even mean. How are you not concerned for the pain I just endured because of your staff didnt even have the decency to apologize. I will never return to this location and be sure to tell all my associates friends family etc to go eat at the Scottsdale location it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I waited for an hour just to get horrible service and an incorrect order ,... how do you forget to put the sides on a dish ? I do not understand? On top of everything the rice was stale it was not soft and fluffy the way it is suppose to be made. On top of everything the manager did not care she said I'll se what's going on with the kitchen ?

{"text":"First things first-
Host team, thumbs up! Very welcoming & sweet. I like it when the hosts address me, instead of me having to get their attention. 

Michael H. was an awesome server, he was very helpful & attentive. It took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted- & he was very patient. Not to mention, he kept our glasses filled with water the entire meal...which is quite a feat, considering we drink like fish. 

Shrimp Scampi Crostini- excellent, very rich in flavor & THICK for a \"small plate\". 
White Bean Hummus- very refreshing, I think I might even prefer it prepared with white beans as opposed to chickpeas. 

The red velvet cheesecake was TO DIE FOR. My goodness! My boyfriend isn't even a fan of red velvet, & he said it was the best cheesecake he's ever had. 

Great experience, all around!!!"}

We've been to this location once and only for cheesecake.  But, in general, we really do like the food at The Cheesecake Factory and sometimes even crave some of the apps and meals here.  But there are a few things that keep us from coming more often.

The good: 
The cheesecake is delicious, and there are SO many options.  I want to try them all but usually can't pass up Reese's or Red Velvet and my husband LOVES the Snickers flavor.  And the portion is very large.  I had to bring some of mine home!  The service was friendly and efficient.  When we sat down our server immediately brought us bread, and we thanked him but told him we'd only be having dessert.  He brought our cheesecake quickly, kept our waters filled, and brought the bill promptly.  Don't you hate going somewhere for dessert and waiting like an hour to receive your bill? So glad that didn't happen! 

The not-so-good: 
This place is just expensive.  Seriously.  Sometimes I wonder - what right do they have to charge these prices?  It's a good chain but our cheesecake cost as much as a small dinner somewhere else!  We knew that going in so it wasn't a surprise but just be aware that cheesecake costs a small fortune here.  

The lighting is very dark.  I have excellent vision and I was squinting to see the menu.  It almost made me too tired to eat cheesecake.  But I found it in me to keep going. 

I can't STAND the seating.  The table you get can make or break your experience.  They have these HUGE cushy booths that they do give to parties of 2 - I saw it.  But of course we get that small 2 person table crammed between two different parties on that really long booth.  Ugh, I could hear entire conversations of the people on either side of me.  And that awkward moment when you have to turn sideways to get in or leave the booth and hope you're not brushing someone's plate with your rear end... I know I'm making kind of a big deal about this but it really is annoying to me.  Please, spread the tables out more.

Overall this is a restaurant that we enjoy coming to sometimes. They have a really great menu selection of food, drinks and cheesecake.  But it's just a once-in-a-blue-moon thing."}
{"text":"Yes, that's right, I'm yelping about a chain restaurant.

As there are no cheesecake factories in Michigan, my friend insisted on going to Cheesecake factory. I've never been that huge of a fan of the place- I mean, it's just a restaurant (always reminds me of Chicago's Grand Lux Cafe) with cheesecake. Meh?

Anyhoo, after waiting FOREVER (the hostess SKIPPED over our name! BAH!), we were finally seated and just ordered appetizers. I've never actually eaten the food at Cheesecake factory before- just the desserts. We ate the appetizers and wow, I was pretty impressed! They were all REALLY REALLY GOOD (I know, it's just Cheesecake factory, right? Man, TRY THE APPETIZERS!)

We tried:
-Ahi Tartare: surprisingly good. I was like, \"uh oh, will this be good?\" but the tuna was good with avocado, and the side of fried wonton skins that went with it was quite good. The sauce on it was pretty interesting as well.
-Roasted Pear and blue cheese pizette: pretty good with the spinach leaves on top. It was kinda strange with the pecans? but still, pretty good.
-Crabcake bites- Mmmm. I was surprised at how well these were cooked. Usually crabcakes are dry-ish when they're deep fried, but these crabcakes were tender and just plain good.
- Fried macaroni cheese balls- it sounds strange, but omg, so amazing. The deep fried balls explode with cheese, as the mac n cheese is hidden inside the deep friedness. Oh man, so so so good. This was my favorite of the night.

For dessert, we ordered the kahlua cheesecake. OMG, SO SO SO GOOD! I'm usually am not a fan at all of cheesecake, but the cheesecake mousse mixed with chocolate and kahlua was amazing. And so rich. We took it home to finish.

I was rather surprised at how good the appetizers were. I think I'll just go here for appetizers and dessert from now on. :)"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years,  long before they came to Pittsburgh.  No matter if it were Las Vegas, San Francisco, Seattle, Baltimore, etc., we've yet to have either a bad meal or unsatisfactory service.  The only thing that's difficult about eating here is making a menu selection as there are toooo many options!"}
{"text":"A must go to for anyone who loves cheesecake. Their menu is extensive, so everyone should be able to find something on the menu. My favorite appetizer to share is the eggroll sampler. The avocado egg roll is amazing and creamy. The salmon firecracker roll containers perfectly cooked salmon in a crispy wrapper. It also comes with the cuban egg roll, tex mex egg roll, and plenty of dipping sauces. 

The Louisiana Chicken pasta was very heavy and ginormous, so I had leftovers. The pasta dish was fine, nothing special. Sometimes I just don't even get an entree to save room for cheesecake. 

My favorite cheesecake is probably the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. The crust is made with coconut macaroons, then there is the mango cheesecake, and on top is a smooth mango mousse. The cheesecake is a light and refreshing way to end the meal. It is not too sweet or artificial tasting. I have also had the cookie dough cheesecake, which is good but not out of this world."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory is always the place to go to when craving some cheesecake. Their menu is extensive and portions are huge. Since it was lunch time, I went with something lighter. I had the Mexican chicken salad. I guess I should not have been surprised that the salad portion was still huge. It had a fried tortilla on the bottom, lots of greens, tomatoes, grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and dressing. I wish there had been more chicken. My friend had the Tuscan chicken dish off the skinnylicious menu and still could not finish her portion. We then of course had to have cheesecake. My favorite is the mango key lime cheesecake, which has a nice coconut crust,key lime cheesecake, mango mousse, and mango glaze. It is creamy, but also very refreshing! A wonderful dessert to have in the summer."}
{"text":"The food here is just ok. The menu is huge so it takes a while to choose what you want to eat. My mom wanted to go here for her birthday dinner and when we told them it was her birthday they offered her a free ice cream sundae. Umm...isn't this place called the CHEESECAKE Factory? I thought it was lame that they didn't offer her a free piece of cheesecake."}
{"text":"The service was friendly but highly inadequate. The food was delivered incorrectly and slowly. Once delivered not overwhelmingly wonderful, but not horrible either...although I did have about three soggy shrimp in the mix. Not sure how you make soggy shrimp but they managed to do it!"}
{"text":"My 15yo daughter and I had a rare evening out without the rest of the family and decided to stop by The Cheesecake Factory while doing some winter formal shopping. My daughter needs to avoid gluten and I new (from a quick search on my phone) that there were many items on the menu that she would be able to choose from. We were seated outside even though it was cold out - but I have to tell you, the heaters they use are AWESOME! It was actually warmer outside than in. Our server was prompt and kind but seemed totally thrown off her game when we asked about gluten free items. The corn tamales app we ordered were SO good but we both thought it was kind of odd that my daughter's GF burger came with no onions, no lettuce, but with tomatoes, pickles and shredded cabbage. Cabbage?? Who has ever had a burger with raw cabbage on it? When we asked if that was they way they normally came the response was, \"Well, ya. Because it was a gluten free bun they put the cabbage on top of it.\" Ummm. OK. When we asked for ketchup she told us it wasn't gluten free either. It was just weird."}
{"text":"Always good service and tasty food.

We enjoyed only desert on our last visit and the cheesecakes were to die for. Always prepared fresh and with new flavors to try, this restaurant never ceases to impress me at every visit."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in like three years, so my roommate and I decided to break the three-year-long hiatus and try it out for dinner once again.

We were seated fairly quickly despite it being a busy weekend night and having no call-ahead for a table.

They had a fancy interior, the dining room was dimly lit (just like all Cheesecake Factories), and the noise level was a little louder than average (it can get quite noisy). 

As for the food, we started off with the avocado egg rolls. It may sound weird, but they're actually SO GOOD. Who would've ever thought that this unique twist on egg rolls could be so delicious? It's fried in an egg roll wrap stuffed with avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.  A must-try for avocado aficionados (or for those who are tired of the standard guacamole)! The sauce it came with was sweet; it was the perfect pairing with the egg rolls. Let this appetizer satisfy your tastebuds with its Avocado-ey goodness!

My main entree was the Louisiana chicken pasta. It had Parmesan crusted chicken (the breading was crunchy and the chicken was juicy!) over farfalle pasta with a sauce that has a bit of a spicy kick to it. This is seriously some good pasta. If you want something that's super filling, I'd go the pasta route.

Presentation of the food could've been a little bit better, but the food was great nonetheless. 

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything was from what I remember. The Cheesecake Factory is probably the best option if you don't want to go anywhere super fancy for dinner."}
{"text":"This location is very inconsistent. Something always happens that eliminates the level of experience you would expect from this restaurant. I go there about 4 times a week during lunch out of convenience for the location. The food is either cold, comes out way too late, or comes out incorrectly. Very rare do we get quick service that's hot and good."}
{"text":"They got two out of three orders wrong, and the service was horrible.  It took over 20
minutes to get our check.  I am done with this Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Went for my son's 20th birthday. We were seated right away. The place is in serious need of some type of light on tables. Had to use the light from our phones to see the menu. 

It took a very long time for our food to arrive. When it finally came, my chicken was burnt and potatoes were cold. I asked the server to send over a manager. The manager made excuses that the recipe for this dish had recently been changed and the kitchen still hadn't gotten the hang of it. She said \"its supposed to be served dark, but not THAT dark.\"  Better to just apologize rather then tell me your kitchen doesn't know how to properly cook your dishes. She said she liked the old recipe and didn't know why they changed it. 

 I sent it back and by the time my new dish arrived everyone else had already finished their meal. This time it wasn't cooked enough! UGH. I just took it to go, since I didn't want everyone else to have to sit there while I struggled through rubbery chicken skin. Truly unappetizing!  I tried to crisp it up the next day and it was still disgusting. I'm very disappointed because this used to be my favorite dish. Also this put a big damper on our birthday celebration. We were so disgusted that we took our cheesecake to go (not even a comp piece for his b'day).

I hope they can get their act together since this is my son's favorite chain."}
{"text":"Meeh. It is what it is, a chain restaurant. Menu is way too extensive and the food is what you would expect from a chain restaurant. I find its current popularity has more to do with the novelty and newness then the actual quality of the food and the place.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good place to meet up with friends and family and have a nice meal. However, overall I find that the place is over priced and the food is mediocre. Conflictingly, I probably would go back, but only if a family or friend insisted we have a get together here. 

And maybe it is just me and my oversensitive nose, but I always find the place stinks of cheese. I know, I know, it is The CHEESEcake factory, duh. Don't get me wrong, I LOOVE Cheese, but this aroma... stench... isn't in a pleasant cheese-y way. But like I said, my nose is very sensitive and I find this more to be personal preference."}
{"text":"Went for my sister's birthday dinner last night. I like the atmosphere there and the service was pretty good. But I always think to myself that they are just a bit overpriced and the food just misses the mark of being great (I got the Navajo sandwhich, it just kind of fell apart and was stuffed with really thick slices of underipe tomato that was white in the middle. Fries were cold). We ordered the kids' pasta for my son and it was just that- a bowl of WAY too hot pasta (I just don't know why restaurants serve kids' meals at 1000 degrees). But that was it, just pasta, no veggies or sides. It is a family place no matter what they try to be, it is a big loud place that people bring their kids to, is it too much to ask for a nice, healthy meal for my kid? But I digress. Again, loved the service but the food was underwhelming. Luckily I really enjoyed spending time with my family and that made it fun :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night during boxing week. Started waiting in line at 7:15 and did not get seated until 10:30 (45 minutes to get the pager and 2.5 hours waiting in line). Completely understandable as it is still fairly new and it's the day after boxing day. The people that were also waiting around us were getting very agitated and took their stress and anger out on the hostess/receptionist person that handled the customers waiting in line and the hosts / servers in the restaurant, which I found to be unfair and unreasonable as the reasons for the extended wait times is mostly out of their control. Also, the mall really helped as we were able to shop around during our wait time. 

Food was great, especially the macaroni & cheese balls! One of the best macaroni & cheese dishes I've ever had. The chicken taquito's were very tasty but it could have had a bit more spice to it, but that's just personal taste. The only thing I didn't like about my experience here was overhearing some of the servers / hosts badmouthing and mocking some of the customers in the presence of other customers. But our server, Michael, was excellent and genuinely friendly; he checked up on us a lot to make sure we were okay. Also, the cheesecakes (Vanilla bean & salted caramel) did take a while to get served to us, but the taste makes up for it. Will come visit again during a not-so-busy time."}
{"text":"Our family of three visited on a Monday evening around 6:30 and had about a 40 minute wait outside in the mall, then another 5 minute wait inside once called, but after we were seated all went well.  Very nice booth, great food and drink, generous portions, reasonable prices.  Service was pretty good overall considering the crowded conditions.  We were pleased with our dining choice, no disappointments.  Recommended."}
{"text":"When desperate for carbohydrates, this chain can do the job. That's what happened; I needed carbs to recharge after a difficult day. Just didn't have the energy to get to someplace better so we shared chocolate truffle cake and I drank some insipid coffee. Nothing to see here folks but also nothing to avoid."}
{"text":"Drinks were delicious, food was amazing, and our waiter Dan, was the best! Can't wait to go back and try more food, and I would even request Dan to be my waiter again."}
{"text":"Still impressed by their avocado egg rolls, and the accompanying dipping sauce (cilantro, honey, lime, garlic, etc) was tap dancing all over my taste buds.  I'd love to have my wife replicate that so we can test out what other foods it would accommodate.

What I wasn't impressed with was their herb-crusted salmon salad.  Maybe it was the word 'crusted' that got me, but I was assuming the fish was going to be served warm.  Surprise!  It was cold.  I choked down as much as I could, but will be going to Pita Jungle and Keegan's for my salmon salads from now on.

And I cant say enough about their pina colada cake cheesecake.  A true taste of the islands, part cake, part cheesecake, all yummy.  The only things missing were the fire dancers and hula girls.

They do take reservations... for parties of 20 or more."}
{"text":"This is the most likely one of the places that i will never return.  The wait was told to get seated was 30 min.  That was 45 minutes.  That was no big deal for the party of 6.  The hostist was nice and polite.  This is where the good times stop.  We sat down and ordered appetizers.  From there we got them to come out at 20 minutes after order.  We also ordered our food at the same time.  It took about 1 hour for our main meal to come out.  When it came out, it was evadent that the plates were held under the heat lamps,  most meals were warm and my childs bowl was the hottest out of the bunch.  The waiters was using a towle to hold the bowl and told us it was hot.  I dont know about you but you would not give a hot plate, where it needs a pot holder to transpor child that is 10.  The meals temp was warm and not hot.  But i guess that is what we get for waiting.  We also has to constantly ask the waiter to refil the drink glasses, remove dishes.  This will be the last time that i will be here."}
{"text":"Ugh. I hate the Cheesecake Factory. I always try to give it another chance and I don't know why. It's not to the food, it's the service. Every. Damn. Time. Worst service ever. 

My husbands birthday, we didn't make a reservation be it wasn't busy so we were seated right away. Ten minutes pass before the waitress takes our DRINK order. Just taking her time, talking to the table next to us, doesn't even look our way. So we wait ten more minutes to get the drinks. (Which were delivered by someone not our waitress) Ten more minutes pass and she still hasn't been back. We got up and left. 

Not exaggerating about the times either! Every time. We're never going back. Not sorry"}
{"text":"I came for some birthday cheesecake here after having a horrible experience at another restaurant. 

Our server was VERY nice!  We had a great time.  The cheesecake is delicious and the atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"I got the sweet corn tamale my favorite appetizer.  It was so much thicker and the green sauce was not plentiful.

The Cesar salad was okay but the crouton was yummy yum yum.

Service was average.  Wait time ok a weekday
At 3:00 was fifteen minutes."}
{"text":"Ordered Steak Diane, medium rare. The food and service is great, however had to wait more than 20 minutes for the plate to be served."}
{"text":"This cheesecake factory is PRETTY busy - they have a long waiting line even at 9PM! It's crazy! So if you dont want to wait for long, just call and make a reservation.

Being a chain restaurant, it is pretty successful I would say. They provide big portions and their steak has always been good. I would strongly recommend their rib eyes. BUT they overcooked it a little bit last time, which was a bummer for me. The waitress was very friendly and nice to us!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  We expected it to take two hours & we were out the door in an hour.They keep things moving.  Order an appetizer and save room for dessert.  The cheesecake slices are big enough to share. Food is always up to pâté of what we expect."}
{"text":"I am always so satisfied with my experiences at The Cheesecake Factory. This location in South Side is the same way. Great happy hour deals - a number of apps are $6 (happy hour is only in the bar area). We tried the Buffalo chicken bombs on my most recent trip this week and they were SO YUM - fried and served with blue cheese. 

My only complaint in this area is the parking is a headache. Cheesecake Factory doesn't have a lot. Plenty of garages around, but just not ideal."}
{"text":"Amazing! Having never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, I was very impressed. Prompt service, even with a long line. Got the luau salad for lunch, it was quite different but very tasty. I expected the prices to be crazy, but they were very affordable. 

We were so impressed, we came back for dinner. The pasta was so good, Even though I was stuffed, the meal was so good that I couldn't stop eating. My husbands \"medium\" steak came out super rare, but he ate it anyway and said it was good. He didn't get any veggies with his steak, just a bowl of mashed potatoes, with a few onion rings plopped on top. Besides the weird steak dinner, the food was still excellent, as well as the service. Next time we are in Vegas, we will stop here again for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night around 7pm and the wait was only 10 minutes for two. AVOCADO EGG-ROLLS are a must have! Our waitress was very nice and the service was fast. I believe her name was Heidi. My only complaint is that we were sitting right next to the hostess podium and when people came in to get their name on the list they would hover right above us. 

Food was served correctly and hot. I love Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"I came here with two other friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of us does not do well with fish or anything too exotic, so the Cheesecake Factory was a safe bet. 

The portions here are large, bordering on insane. Some items are average in price to quantity ratio such as the potstickers, but then there are ridiculously big selections such as their chicken nachos. We started with these two appetizers and a few drinks. Looking through their menu is daunting. Flipping through page after page, it all becomes a blur. It took us twenty minutes to settle on our meals. 

Many of these plates could easily feed two and my friends did not want to split an entree with me. It definitely made me appreciate their Skinnylicious offerings. All of the items on this separate menu possessed less than 590 calories. It is not like other places that only have a few selections to choose from. No, this was a full blown menu with burgers, salads, pizzas, fish, and more. Looking at this was a task on its own. I ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I am a huge fan of beets. The patty is not like a Boca Burger. It is not condense or have the texture of meat. It is made up of farro, a wheat grain, and the deep burgundy vegetable. After a few bites, I gave up on trying to eat it as a burger and just ate the contents between the bun. It just felt odd to eat all these carbs together. The farro was cooked well and I enjoyed its flavor. It would make for a good salad. 

Now comes the real reason to come to the Cheesecake Factory, it is all about their... brownies. I kid, the only reason why I still come back to this establishment is for their cheesecake. The Red Velvet is my go to dessert. The white chocolate curls on the outside makes this treat even more decadent. Too bad, cheesecake does not make for a well balanced meal."}
{"text":"Instead of fighting the crowd out after a show at the Colosseum, it is better to just get dinner and wait it out. I do not have fond memories of this location. I had a birthday here when I was a teenager, 7 out of 25 of us got food poisoning, and never looked back until now. Almost a decade has passed and a part of me cringed when my friend suggested going here. I wanted to go to the other place known for their desserts in the Forums, but she is allergic to chocolate. 

Between three of us, we split the Buffalo Chicken Blasts, Skinnylicious Spicy Chicken Salad, and the Everything Pizza with kalamata olives and jalapenos. Overall, the food was decent. It is nothing spectacular. In fact, the only thing that is impressive about it is the sheer amount they give you. We could have probably stuck with two items and splitting between three."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory they're great every time I go. I love that they have such a large and versatile menu so you multiple choices. They literally have everything from Chinese to burgers. I've tried multiple things off their menu and everything has been amazing. The orange chicken is some of the best I've had. Of course the cheesecake is amazing as well. They also have a pretty large selection of cheesecake to choose from. Last time we tried the new Reese's cheesecake and omg it was amazing. We usually get the Adams peanut butter which is very similar but the Reese's was very good. I highly recommend this place especially if you're with a large group because the menu has so many different options it can please everyone. The wait can just get kind of long but it usually goes by pretty fast and it is more on the pricey side (average $40-$50 for two)  but still not a bad price for how good the food is."}
{"text":"I went to this Cheesecake Factory last night with my family, there were 6 of us. We all thought the meal was not that good. Tortilla Chips were given with the artichoke dip. That doesn't go with the dip. Bread would have been nicer. The dip wasn't that good anyways. The crab wontons were good as well as the cheesy bread. All except one of us had pasta dishes. All the dishes were bland with very little toppings. The other person got fish tacos. He was happy with that. The cheesecake is always good. We will not go back for anything there again except for the cheesecake. The service is good, but unless the food is good, there is no point in going."}
{"text":"Been to other CF locations around the country, but this one never seems to get things quite right. Last few times we ate there, the food was really, really salty. We always get spotty service for some reason, but keep coming back for the dessert. (And even then, I don't think we've done that for months.) There's so many places within a ten minute drive that offer way better value for the money."}
{"text":"Horrible service! This was my first and possibly my last time eating at this location. I'll probably stop by and get a slice of cheesecake but that's all. 

My waitress kept forgetting about us(my daughter and I). I ordered a burger and added mozzarella cheese. My burger was supposed to come with fries but I never received my fries. My waitress later apologized and offered to boxed them up so I can take them to go. She later returned with the bill and NO fries stating that the cost of the mozzarella cheese ($1.50) was removed from my bill instead. She placed the bill on the table and walked away. About 10 -15 mins went by and I was still waiting to pay my bill. I got impatient and walked to the bar area near the patio to pay. At first the waitress standing there was hesitant to to process my bill but I explained what was going on she processed it and walked away. I could have walked out without paying or without leaving a tip but that's not me. 

Next time I will stick to just the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I give a lot of chain restaurants 5 stars and I often reflect on whether they are deserved. This place does deserve it. Every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to just has overall great atmosphere, great service, great food, and Great Dessert! This one is no different. I met some friends here for dessert and we all enjoy delicious cheesecake. I had the chocolate truffle cake and it really was amazing! I don't think I could have found a better one that night. The parking was a little bit confusing but apparently you can park in a private lot and get them to validate it. That would be good to know for next time."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch/dinner with my family. We were sat right away. Hostess were friendly and welcoming. 
Our sever was Sarah J. And she was awesome. We were also being helped by a guy but we didn't catch his name. They were both really attentive, and took great care of us. They even brought out some bread with slices of bananas for our baby. The food was delicious!! I had the chicken piccata (I think that's what it was called) and I highly recommend it! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Always a good stand by when you have no idea where to eat. The food and service is always good, never been to a bad Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone, plus the cheesecakes are delicious.
Bistro Shrimp, Kobe Burger, Louisiana Chicken and Pasta are some of the dishes we always seem to get. Tuxedo Chocolate, White Chocolate Macadamia, Vanilla Bean are the cheesecakes we tend to drool over."}
{"text":"We have been to Cheesecake many times and have always enjoyed their food. My wife and I decided on Cheesecake for dinner, we are visiting from Chicago. We were seated promptly which is a rare occurrence at 6:00 PM. Our waitress was very nice.  My wife ordered pot stickers and ahi, both of which she enjoyed. I was not so fortunate. I ordered Bistro Shrimp Pasta. The problem with this dish was the shrimp. Instead of whole shrimp the dish had chopped pieces of what appeared to be bay shrimp or scraps.  The shrimp was coated with bread crumbs which turned into a sticky, gooey mess.  The shrimp were not eatable and I had to scrap the coating off to eat chunks of tasteless shrimp."}
{"text":"This would have had 4 or more stars; however we ran into a problem while visiting. My fiance and I waited so long for our lunch to be served in a half empty restaurant that one of the managers came by to tell us it's taking a bit longer (this was when we already were sitting there for nearly 40 minutes). Food was good as expected, but not a good impression on our first visit here. They did not offer any discount or partial comp. We ordered an appetizer and 2 lunch meals and it took about 90 minutes from beginning to end because the food was so late. Still giving it 3 stars; however could have easliy gotten 4 or more if they were a bit more on top of things."}
{"text":"It's taken me forever and a few years to write a review for The Cheesecake Factory at Ross Park Mall.  I guess it's because I don't really understand the love and the appeal.  This place is almost always packed!!  I also don't really understand how they can have such a large menu that covers almost every type of food there is and get everything right.  And that's because they don't.  Even so, the masses flock to this place like bees to a hive.

It should be the ultimate place to dine while at the mall!  Beautiful interior, soaring ceilings, custom painted fancy columns, dark wood booths.  Service is friendly and generally spot on.  

Back to the menu (complete with advertisements, am I the only one that finds this so tacky?), you can get pizza, pasta,(including jambalaya style) seafood, steaks and chops, salads, sandwiches, burgers, omelets and Sunday Brunch.  For beverages, they serve wine, beer, cocktails, frozen drinks, espresso, milkshakes.  Again, you want it, they got it.  

Quantities can sometimes be too large.  I got a salad here one time that was so big it was almost embarrassing.  I could not longer see my date over my salad.  It was more greens that I could eat in one week.  Oh, and the cheesecake.  The choices here are also over the top and decedent.  But really, who has room left for dessert?  Of course, they are more than happy to bag it up for you to take out.

A recent addition that is making me like them more is The SkinnyLicious Menu.  Again, an overkill with all the choices.  And you will never get skinny eating these meals, but it is a vast improvement over their regular fare."}
{"text":"The hispanic lady who handles take outs is antagonizing and pretentious. On a recent visit she made a racist comment when I was at the counter making an order and proceeded to chuckle at her own racial comment. Where the food is the level of service in Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"i'm a fan of the cheesecake factory in general. i always hear that the quality of food is just not worth the price, etc. i've had amazing and iffy dishes here, but overall, i think the price is pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get and i'd say the majority of the dishes i've tried here i've liked. oh and, if you've never had it, you HAVE TO try the cheesecake. every flavor i've had, i've loved.
now, about this location specifically. parking is kind of a pain unless you're ok with parking in the garage. this location is pretty big but always busy, so be prepared to wait at least a few minutes. but i've always had good servers here. knowledgeable, nice, and a sense of humor. i'd recommend this location, especially for your first cheesecake factory experience."}
{"text":"The servers are nice , but overall it was expensive and the food wasn't tasting expensive . When our hostess sat us down there was just trash and food everywhere under the booth . It was disgusting . Especially the fact I worked in a restaurant.  It urged me to get a manager out there . I've seen the place get packed but I don't see why this place is so well know for if the food is not very accommodating ."}
{"text":"My favorite go to restaurant when my husband and I were just dating. Ambience is okay, staff and service were not a problem during our visits. Their menu is tremendous, 100+ items  to choose from. From salads to burgers, pastas, and more. There is something for everyone vegan or not! I have probably tried almost every cheesecake on their menu except the key lime, not a fan! Carrot cake is perfect, not too sweet and just enough flavor and ingredients. The white chocolate rasberry cheesecake is our fave. Oreo like crust and curled white chocolate pieces on the sides with a hint of swirled in rasberry puree. Fried calamari is an appetizer to order. Lightly battered, perfectly seasoned and crisp! It's served with a garlic aioli like sauce and cocktail sauce. 

List of our favorites...
Chicken Bellagio- crispy coated chicken breasts over basil pasta and parmesan cream sauce topped with arugula and prosciutto. 

Steak diane and Shrimp scampi- We enjoy our steak medium well. Very amazing flavor of marinated steak and shrimp. Mash potatoes were creamy and perfectly paired with grilled asparagus. Perfect all the time, won't disappoint!

Avocado egg rolls appetizer- The dipping sauce for this egg roll is what makes this soo tasty. It has a taste of honey, soy sauce and ginger."}
{"text":"Three stars because our waiter was friendly and made an effort. The food however was not that good. Calamari was subpar and my fish and chips were pretty gross. Seriously it's a fried protein on top of a fried starch, it's kind of a no brainer but this  was just so bland and mushy. Also it came out lukewarm and got cold while I waited the ten minutes for the rest of my party to get served their food. My nephews all got burgers that were over cooked. Overall this was not a good restaurant experience."}
{"text":"So I waited until the hoopla of the opening wore off before even considering a visit to the Cheesecake Factory.  Even on a cold Tuesday night in February, there was a twenty minute wait for dining in the pretty and dim dining room at 5:30 pm.  But there was immediate seating in the Indoor Patio.  My guest and I were fine with that so we were shown to a table pretty quickly.  The chairs were comfortable and it was kinda fun to people watch in the Mall.

So both my guest and I knew Cheesecake was on our minds so we each got appetizer.  She ordered the Cuban rolls.  Very good flavor with the mustard sauce on the side.  I had the Ahi tartare.  The fish was very fresh and the sesame dressing was incredible.  I would have called it a Poke versus a Tartare but I loved it no matter what it was called.

My guest ordered the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel and I ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme.  Yeah!  Both slices of cheesecake were out of this world.  It would be easy to just come for the dessert alone.

we were given very good service from the host to the server to the food delivery servers.  The calories and price will keep this place as a periodically treat.  But a treat I will look forward to."}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner and a drink after a long week. I love Cheesecake Factory and all I needed (wanted) in my life was a slice of their cheesecake. Long story short, I didn't get it. Sad day. 

The wait was practically nonexistent, though I did have to wait for just a few minutes for the hostess to return, since there was seemingly only one on duty for the beginning of dinner. Not terrible. We sat down and this is where the waiting really happened. It took a little while to get waters, then to get our drinks ordered, and then to order. A lot of time was spent waiting for the waiter to come back and check up on us and to get our bill. I needed to get going for a movie, and I knew that if I had ordered that darn cheesecake, we would have been sitting around even longer. I'll come back here for sure, but I was just less than impressed with my experience this time around."}
{"text":"Bring your headlamp and a jacket!  This place is dark as a cave and almost as cold.  We actually got our iPhone flashlights out to see our food.  Was seated by the window which was quite breezy.  Food is always good but the atmosphere left little to be desired."}
{"text":"Worse Cheesecake Factory I ever been to. Visited on 12/26/2016. 

1) food was dry, bland and too salty. 
2) ran out of Coke and without asking, the server brought me a Coke Zero, which I don't like 
3) requested more wheat bread and came back 30 minutes later telling me there's no more wheat bread. 
4) fryer out of service and no fried food. 
5) no substitution on kids meal Apple juice with orange juice. 

I am a regular to Cheesecake Factory in CA locations and this location is just one of the worse I ever been to."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite. I do, however, get really overwhelmed with the amount of pages there are on their menu. But that's just more options!

I like ordering appetizers cus I can get full off those rather quickly. My absolute favorite is the loaded baked potato tots. It's exactly what it's called and the flavor is delicious! I also like ordering the egg roll sampler -- because I can't choose just one type of egg roll lol. 

When I'm on my lunch break with co-workers, we sit at the bar and get quick service. The lunch specials are amazing and so are the prices. I love the crusted Chicken Romano lunch special! 

On a normal visit with no time restraints, we get seated anywhere. The most recent time, our server, Sayem, took really good care of us. He had a lot of recommendations and was very friendly. He even had some staff sing to my friend for her birthday! Now that's customer service! 

Now for the best part: dessert. Anything is delicious, really. I like the lemon merengue cheesecake, Oreo dream extreme cheesecake, the snickers cheesecake, even the original is yummy! But you have to remember to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"True to its franchise, the food and service here hold up. 

The line is the worst part and sometimes the wait can be 2 hours. I know!!

Once you get a table and are ready to enjoy, the service is totally 5 star. They wait on you, are friendly and patient, and they are so chirpy which really makes a huge difference on your whole experience. 

The food is delicious. Its the same as having it in the USA. The portions are huge and the food is tasty. 

Lastly, the cheesecake...wow! That's it."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is definitely on my list of favorites....Ive never been to this location before and I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive, and the food was pretty good although my shrimp was a bit over cooked (I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo)...one thing that really bothered me was how filthy their silverware was (there was pieces of leftover food on my spoon and butter knife). I asked my waiter for an extra set of silverware and cup of hot water to soak them in...problem solved...I don't live in this area so I'm sure I won't be returning to this location"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience! Nearly 3 hours for dinner and almost 45 min to get the check. Several mess ups and the waiter didn't seem to care and neither did the manager. Never go to this location!"}
{"text":"Second time going to this location both times I been there I had the best servers.

I recently went there for my husbands birthday. The young man was very polite and helpful
he answered all the questions we had about the menu and even recommended some of their popular plates.

He was right our food came out on time and hot didn't have to wait long.

Staff was super friendly I just loved it ! 

I want to thank them all! 

I will be coming back for my mothers birthday!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is....a restaurant...a more expensive Chili's/Fridays/Applebees? Idk, every time I come here, I wonder to myself why I am not at a mom and pop having a much better food experience. The food is okay, kind of bland and don't even get me started and the bible that is the menu. How is anyone supposed to choose a dish when they're not entirely sure how long it will take to read it? (First World Problem) Anyways, despite the mediocre cheesecake and food, the service is always great and I can expect to take home hella leftovers, no complaints about that. Oh also, the pumpernickel bread is the ish, don't sleep on it."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong... who doesn't love The Cheesecake Factory? This review is specifically aimed for this location.  This was my first time to this property. I came tonight for a birthday party. Now I understand large groups can be challenging but with that being said there were still some awkward moments. I arrived and when I asked for my party the girl at the front just gave me half ass directions. She told me to go through the double doors. The only double doors I saw looked like an exit outside so I just kind of roamed around aimlessly until I was able to stop and ask another employee where to go. So those double doors that led out were correct. So they have doors that go outside first and then there is another set of doors leading to a separate room. But come on.... I know I couldn't have been the first person to be confused by the layout. It wouldn't have killed her to give a little more detail. Our server was nice and personable. I ordered the Louisiana pasta. Tasty but not really memorable. The lady next to me ordered the salmon which she said was fantastic. Two people on opposite ends of the table ordered the shrimp angel hair pasta and they both said the shrimp was WAY over cooked, rubbery and a lot of shell. See no one really checked on how the meal was until we were all almost done. Since it was a birthday my friend was trying to be discreet and let the server know about the dissatisfaction with the shrimp on two dishes. His response was that she should have let him no sooner. And yes... she should have. But no one came by to check. So was she supposed to interrupt dinner to find someone. Again, it was a birthday party and she didn't want to make a scene. Then the check came without offering anyone dessert. Yes.... dessert came for the birthday girl. So that should have been a great time to ask anyone if they would like to finish it off with something sweet. When my check was handed to me I asked for a piece to go and was told I would have to have two separate checks. Ok fine. I guess it's somehow my fault I wasn't offered dessert before the check. 2 bills then. Whatever. Just bring me my cheesecake please...."}
{"text":"I like cheesecake so this place is perfect for me although the last time I went there and I got food for takeout it was not the same consistency as my dining in experience which Agitated me a little bit and that's why gave him three stars because I believe if you're going to turn out a phenomenal product it shouldn't be any less just because it's going through takeout"}
{"text":"Went here for my bday last night with some family and friends . Our waitress Candice was pretty nice so i didn't take things out on here but It was very inconvenient and annoying to be constantly told that they were out of what we ordered . We were there much longer than we wanted to be cause we waiting forever for our food to get to us . I was so disappointed. At one point i didn't even want to wait for my food . I just wanted to leave ."}
{"text":"Cheesecake has a pretty extensive menu which is what keeps it in my rotation of go-to chains. There is something for everyone on the menu, so it's great for larger groups. Mexican, Asian, American and Italian inspired dishes cover the pages. 

I'm not one to watch my diet but they do have gluten free options and a \"skinnylicious\" menu that are not limited to one or two items. You get selection there too. 

I've always had solid service here. When it's busy things may be a tad slower but they deliver and are attentive. 

While I've had good salads, burgers and appetizers here, this time I opted for the shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Wow! Definitely my new favorite. You get to taste both of these entrees and a pile of mashed potatoes separates them. YUM!

The cheesecakes are all pretty amazing. For a chocolate/PB fan, Adam's Peanut Butter Pie is the go to move. I deviated and got the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake this visit and while it was good, I'll definitely go back to Adam's next time. Again, there is something for everyone even on the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Yummy food and rich cheesecake :) I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory numerous times over the years. 

I wanted to take a moment to yelp the help. In this case, I am giving a shot out to Even. We were sitting on the patio and he had a pretty decent table load, yet he was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"Great service, fun atmosphere, and such an expansive menu you will easily find something for everyone no matter what you are craving! And somehow they are able to nail every dish, I haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"Service and food were amazing! The cheesecake was perfect! We went for dinner on our honeymoon..so glad we chose the cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"This place amazes me, they are usually so busy, timing is very important, you come at just the right time and they get you in and taken care of! 

Usually we can wait less than 10-15 minutes for a table, by the time we leave it's a mad house. Waiting times up to 45 minutes. We learned to come just before the rush or come late, after the crowds, either way, service is still good!

We never feel rushed, our service is always great and the food is consistent. Love the +30 cheesecakes to choose from. Be it a holiday, weekend, or weekday, they really make you feel satisfied.

My favorite new dish this time was the soy glazed edamame! It's spicy, it's slighty sweet, it's warm and very good!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory truly is one of my favourite restaurants -- Service is always tops and the portions are HUGE! 

Dined in on the 21st of December for my baby sisters birthday and this location had the perfect vibe, music and staff. Our server Jeff was a delight so definitely ask for him when you're there!

Their Avocado Egg Rolls served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce is to die for! If you haven't had it yet and want a savoury appetiser, it's the best choice. Egg Rolls were fresh, crunchy and the sauce is delicious; If they bottled it and sell it, I'd definitely buy. 

For my entrée, I had the yummy Evelyn's Favourite Pasta; rigatoni tossed with so many veggies and topped with a pesto. 

I also got the Vegan Cobb Salad, which by the way is HUGE, so I definitely recommend sharing it! 

Last but not least, my favourite part... the Cheesecake. You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get Cheesecake, that's just wrong. So I had a slice of the Celebration Cheesecake and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake to go."}
{"text":"I was surprised.  I didn't really want to go to this very load packed warehouse I mean factory.  I was surprised at the quality of food. I had salmon.  The wait time was only about 15 minutes not bad for just popping in. The staff was attentive and friendly. Atmosphere was as expected it was very loud but we got a table in a quieter section. Overall I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The only problem I encountered here was that I got FULL!!! Everything was so good I wanted to keep eating!!!! The waiter was great and patient. Very kid friendly!!!"}
{"text":"We had a VERY disappointing experience here Friday night. I called just after they opened to see if I could bring in a cake for our server to bring to our table for my daughter's birthday. The manager I spoke to was pleasant and confirmed that, yes, I could bring in my own cake, and just let our server know that I had brought it in. 

I took the cake and bday candles to them early in the afternoon, and the hostess who took it made a note that it was mine and then put it in their fridge up front. 

Once we arrived that evening, I spoke to the hostess (on the DL, so my daughter would be surprised), and asked her to tell our server Brandon that the cake was for my daughter and to bring it out with the candles in it after dinner. The hostess followed me back to my table so she was sure to talk to the right server about the right table/party. 

Dinner came and went. It was all very good, but expensive, which is expected there. Then the bill came, and I tipped about 25% because I appreciated the extra trouble of them letting me bring in my own cake, etc. 

But after the server took my money, we never saw him again - and no one ever brought out her cake!! NOTHING!! After we waited a while and realized it wasn't happening, we decided to leave. When I stopped at the front and explained what happened (or what didn't happen) and asked for my cake back, the man at the counter casually handed it back without making any effort to make the situation right!!! 

I was so disappointed and felt so bad for my daughter to not get the the birthday fun I thought I had set up for her. 

Bad job, Brandon and Cheesecake Factory. You really dropped the ball. 

The next day I wanted to complete the online survey about my experience, but realized too late that having the receipt handy is required, and I didn't have it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great air conditioner blows cold. Clean. Good wait staff and did I say that the food was great!  We had a variety. One had breakfast,  one had cheeseburger, one had pizza and salad and one had salmon dinner. Of course we topped it off with Reese cheesecake.  Just wish the pumpkin cheesecake were not a seasonal thing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and so is the cheesecake! During the weekend the wait for a table can be pretty long and i'm not sure if they take reservations or not. Staff is nice and always ask you if they can get you something else. The portions are HUGE! I ordered a salad off of the \"skinny\" menu they have and it was still humungous! Food isn't the best for you but it is really good. The menu is huge here so if you are a picky eater than this place is the best place for you since there is so many items to pick from! Always have a good experience every time I come here!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my family a little while back and I can tell you I was pretty dissapointed. The decor and vibe of the whole place was very sophisticated and pleasing to look at. We waited probably about 45 minutes just for our appetizers to come, and I got the fried mac and cheese bites. They were pretty good, but they were burnt. The bread they served was pretty stale. It felt like an eternity waiting for our main dish. My sister's boyfriend got the wrong meal several times, and my meal (which I believe was a penne four cheese pasta with chicken) was salty, the sauce was horrible and the chicken was pretty soggy. My brother got a burger that was meant to be medium rare and he got well done, as well. The staff treated us like little children. The cheesecake was pretty okay, but it was pretty much the same thing you could get from the grocery store. We got our bill reduced due to mistakes, and it somehow still came out to be about $300. Overall, very mediocre for such a high price."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday with my family and had a relatively short wait time. We had an awesome waitress named Sara. She was personable, kind and attentive. There was some older people sitting across from us who also commented on how awesome Sara was. Our food came and I was so hungry that I ate it before I remembered to take a picture lol. I will be back again !"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always great and no problems with service. Now I've also been able to indulge in getting it delivered."}
{"text":"Shame in you CCF! Turning away a family of 4 because we had a toddler and a baby (sleeping) in a stroller!"}
{"text":"I was there one a date and lost the opportunity to bed one of the cutest little French spinners you have ever seen over the service we received.  We waited an hour and a half for our stinky meatloaf.  Followed by our 30 minute wait for cheesecake.  I have to admit the food was actually good.  The problem is the little hot French spinner had a curfew.  She had promised me a great time.  We were late for curfew when we left the Restraunt.  Thanks a lot.  She got back with her boyfriend of 4 years the next week.  I could have been her mistake."}
{"text":"The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is somewhat overwhelming in it's size and breadth.  While it's a lot to take in, the menu also offers pretty much something for anyone so, it's a nice destination for a large group who can't agree on a particular genre of food for the night.

Definitely enjoy the avocado egg roll appetizer.  Fresh, ripe avocado mixed with some diced tomato, red onion...  They are quite good.  As far as their namesake dish, cheesecake, I'm not that big a fan.  Not much of a dessert fan but I do love a good slice of cheesecake and find the Factory's to be a little to fluffy in texture for my tastes.  I prefer something more dense.  They have a large the selection of flavors however and my wife swears by the \"Dulce de Leche\" version.

For a drink, if you're going non-alcoholic, I like their lemonade a lot.  Fresh and tart.  Definitely not Country Time!"}
{"text":"We usually make it here at least a couple of times a year. This time, we were influenced by $50 in gift cards to dine on a Wednesday night around 7:30. Our party of seven waited about 15 minutes outside before we were greeted by our server who was kind enough to come outside and lead us inside to our table. The menu can be overwelming with endless choices. But that is good for our group which has a pretty wide spectrum of preferences. There hasn't been too many changes to the menu over the years with the small plates and Skinnylicious options being the most recent to me. For the rookies, don't go hog wild on the bread, because you won't be able to finish your three-serving portion entree.

Our order was pretty varied which included two entree salads, three sandwiches, a pasta dish, and the filet medallion off the Skinnylicious menu for me. There was plenty of \"filler\" vegetables and not a lot of beef for my entree as expected, but the vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. The pasta dishes have never really impressed me, but the salads are surprisingly good. If I don't get a steak dish, I'll usually get the tuna tataki salad which is a very flavorful salad. Everyone was happy with their meals with over half us needing take out boxes. We finished with two pieces of cheesecake. Over time, I've found that I prefer cheesecakes without any cake mixed in like the fresh strawberry, banana cream, and salted caramel.

I do have to comment on our server who left a good first impression by greeting us outside, but everything else really wasn't up to par. To add to the rehearsed, corny jokes where the response was crickets chirping after each one, he had no organization of our orders. Stating that I was seat 1 when taking drink orders and my daughter was seat 7 sitting across from me at the end of the table, he had no clue who drank what when he brought the drinks out, auctioning each one and running back and forth across the table. He forgot my mother and wife's glasses of wine, didn't notice they were without beverage after three return trips to the table, and he had to be reminded by me to grab them at the bar after 15 minutes. Then he did the always annoying checking every three minutes if I had signed the receipt after he ran my credit card. Which meant he was cut and wanting to bolt, but you don't want to perturb the person that is signing off on your tip.

Before gift cards were discounted, our check was a reasonable $163. What you'll get with Cheesecake Factory, as you will with other successful chains, is consistency. They need that consistency to handle the amount of volume that comes through the doors. The food and atmosphere in this location are also consistent with every other restaurant. The changing variable is the service, which is usually a hit. It comes down to whether you think that consistency is good, and I would tend to agree with most Yelpers that it is A-OK."}
{"text":"Amazing low carb cheesecake clean, great service and great seldction per usual! Glad to have gone out on a whim and ordered the chicken teriyaki - high quality white meat!"}
{"text":"Literally one of the worst Cheesecake experiences I have ever had in America or abroad. You expect consistency and at least passable quality when going to a chain establishment, but not the case here at this location. Wednesday night last week stopped in for a late dinner (9PM) after a long day. The server was great very attentive, but unfortunately the same couldn't be said about the kitchen. Ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps  and my friend ordered a burger - one hour in an empty restaurant to grill some chicken - and plate it with lettuce. Kind of crazy, no apology from the waiter on the wait. 

Food finally came out - there were three chicken pieces on the plate - 3 about the size of two of my fingers side by side. - $14 for that? Sauce was missing from the plate and the lettuce was rotting. I wish I would have stopped to talk to a manager, but after a long day all I wanted was to eat and go home especially after an hour wait in a basically empty restaurant. 

I really hope this location gets it together, because this experience has a previously loyal customer questioning future visits."}
{"text":"I'm always buy at least once a week from Cheesecake Factory and David the manger at this location was very rude almost look like he have a problem with Foreigners was disrespectful and very condescending didn't even try to help after they did a mistake with my order if that the service Cheesecake Factory the starting to bring I can see them losing a lot of customers and a lot of complaints to the BBB it look like this guy is trying to get this place to get a bad name!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was by far my worse cheesecake factory experience of all time.

1. waited 30+ minutes for food (which was a menagerie of appetizers)
2. Buffalo blasts were burnt
3. waited 20 minutes forba 2nd beer
4. medium macaroni and cheese burger was borderline well and had the smallest amount of mac on that dish I've ever seen. (which I've ordered many times) 
5. Lost my cousin's debit card within a 10 ft distance and then did not put really any effort into finding the card. 
6. Did not offer any compensation for the epic failures of the evening.  (like perhaps free cheesecake or a comped bill)"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my niece's 16th birthday (omg, my niece is 16). She picked the place. It was good but not great. At least the cheesecake was amazing! Been to the cheesecake factory before. I feel like the menu is way too big. I feel the food could be phenomenal but there is just way too much on the menu. We were seated immediately and were waited on promptly by our wonderful waitress. She was great the entire time we were there. I chose the herb encrusted salmon with the lemon sauce on the side. The fish was way overcooked but the asparagus and mashed potatoes were yummy. My niece chose fettuccine Alfredo and thought is was delightful. My sister chose the ahi tuna salad and raved about it. The hubby got the Cuban sandwich and liked it a lot noting a little greasy but good. My mom got the chicken salad sandwich and liked it other than the fact it was too much to eat. My dad got some sort of chicken and liked it (I am not sure what kind of chicken because he was at the opposite end of the table). Then dessert. You can't go to the cheesecake factory and not get dessert. Me and my mom got the strawberry classic. Light and tasty! The hubby chose tiramisu which he thoroughly enjoyed (it too was good, good flavor and a huge portion). My dad got chocolate cake which he devoured. My sister got the salted caramel pretzel, wow! It was heavier but man was it scrumptious! And the birthday girl chose the tuxedo which was chocolatey and good! All in all the food was just okay. The wait staff was terrific and the dessert is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This Cheesecake factory is always busy!!! There always seems to be a line out the door. The entrance area is always so congested but what is there to say other than, the cheesecake rocks!!! We haven't eaten in since they first opened but we have been here numerous times to get cheesecake to go. The staff at the cheesecake counter is always friendly and fast. Makes it easy to get our cheesecake to go because their cheesecake is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday today, obviously picking it for a special occasion. I ordered the Herb Crusted Chicken and when I got the plate, the chicken was very very bland. I have had a lot of chicken in my day, but that has to rank as one of the worst. The mashed potatoes and green beans were also very cold. The silverware also had food stuck on it when we got ours. The star is for the waiter who was very nice. Very disappointed and will not return ."}
{"text":"Never, ever disappointed!  Great selection across the board! If you can't find something you like on this vast menu, I feel sorry for you. 

Love the skinny menu, cocktail choices,  and of course. ...desserts!!! Favorite pineapple upside down cheesecake, phenomenal!  

Love the decor, lighting, knowledgeable staff, and accomodating management."}
{"text":"Always a good, reliable and consistent restaurant.  Lots of great options.  We are trying to eat better and we're worried we wouldn't be able to find anything, but they had a huge \"skinny\" menu with lots of great choices.  I had the Tuscan Chicken and it was really good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Go here often.
Service is good, food is usually very good.  Excellent selection of drinks.
Clean.  I often get the Thai lettuce wraps as a dinner rather than an app. 
The burgers are very unctuous.  Not for those on Lipitor.
Got the Grilled Steak Medallions last Friday -- cut them with my fork.

Parking can be a problem on Friday nights, but you can usually find a spot less than a 3-minute walk from the front door.
Wife and daughter's favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't order takeout here. Better yet, don't order anything but the cheesecake, because the value is just terrible. I understand that takeout food is usually not hot, but my food was literally cold once I got it to my house (5 minutes away). The hosts and hostesses were pleasant, which is why I'm adding a star."}
{"text":"Overrated!!! Overpriced!!! Very few vegan options. Get with the times.  Just wondering when the craze will die down. We have way better Canadian restos."}
{"text":"Loved it years ago in LA....feel as though with any enormous chain restaurant, quality is suffering. Do I love that the menu is longer than the Bible? Or does it actually just drive me mad causing me to drive my salad fork into my forehead while perusing the ad-riddled pages? I'm always here for the comfort food. And I don't order those ridiculous salads, large enough to fill the salad bar at Soup Or Salad! Frankly I simply cannot digest all the raw roughage in one sitting. Cauliflower is no longer my friend. Yesterday I ordered the Hungarian Beef Ghoulash. Meet was very tender, gravy was too salty and the egg noodles that came with were a bit bland. I guess you need to ask for a gravy or sauce for them, cuz they was jest naked. Rickie's meatloaf, tasted just like my entree...I swear...I tasted no difference in the sauce. The Buffalo Chicken triangle thingy appetizer was different and tasty. Crispy, spicy triangles of lightly battered something or other filled with chicken. With so many newer places opening up all over town done in minimal/urban decor, The Cheesecake Factory really sticks out like a loud relative at a dinner party. Hmmm...will I go back? Probably...too convienent after movies at the Esplanade. And if I try everything on the menu eventually, I know I'll be navigating my walker with the yellow tennis balls attached, but I'm bound to find the fresh, consistent and comforting dish I so want."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are always great! I'm a little hesitant going to chain restaurants, but this place is awesome!

Every time I come here, the food is perfection! I always opt for the tomato basil pasta. I've had the meatloaf (great!), ahi(tuna) tar tare (fabulous!), Godiva cheesecake (descendant), cosmopolitan (strong!). If you and your dining guests are indecisive on where to eat... this is the place to go! Everything you can possibly think of if listed on the menu in some form. 

The waiter we had this time around seemed new. He was very friendly, but needed more experience. 

My only real complaint is the wait and the reservation guidelines. Basically, you have to reserve before 11am (if you're a large group), or wait in the main area for hours before getting a table after 7PM on a weekend. This is a major restaurant to go to in the Pittsburgh area apparently. If you go on a weekend, I would suggest getting there between 5:30 and 6:30 to avoid waiting forever."}
{"text":"Ok I'm not a rocket scientist, but if you have outside seating you better be prepared, especially on a nice day, to have people want to sit outside.  I have to agree with other reviewers it's time for corporate management to take a look at who they have managing this place.

We got to the restaurant, after we talked my co-workers husband into coming here kicking and screaming b/c they had had such a horrible experience at this location in the past that he vowed never to return, and asked to be sat outside. Guess what? No outside seating was available. WHAT? #epicfail!!!  Even if you don't have someone to cover the tables outside-FIND SOMEONE. [Strike 1] It's 11:30 am during the week, someone will take the table, make it happen. Instead we got shoved into a very small booth in the corner, where there was a waiter [Strike 2]. I'm a small person, 5'3 and it was a tight squeeze for me.

They have a new Skinny-licious menu which is the only reason, besides their divine brown bread, that they are on the board. Everything is under 590 calories-they don't tell you the fat grams...so they are on their way but not there yet.

If you have a craving for some good food and you are in this area try Settebello Pizza, The BBQ joint by GVR, or the Italian restaurant in GVR -skip this place and skip China Grille."}
{"text":"Okay, so I thought this place was overly hyped but damn are their cheesecakes good! 
The dine in line up can be super long and ridiculous, so we lined up for take out instead and were in and out in about half an hour. 
I love me a red velvet cheesecake and this is my #1 go to, it's just so light and fluffy while also being filling. I've also tried the celebration cake which tastes exactly like birthday cake. The mango lime one is a bit too sweet for me due to the coconut crust, while the dulce de leche along with the chocolate hazelnut crunch left me feeling meh. 
The actual food on the other hand is so-so. For the price of a plate of alfredo, I expected a bit more and it was pretty plain and bland. Just something to keep in mind if you're not coming here solely for the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, and those times are usually for friends.  This place is good, but I don't really think people should hype it up so much.  

The interior is nicely decorated, but it felt very dim when I in to eat.  I'd prefer a little more lighting there for some reason.  I thought that they could have someone make the bathroom a little cleaner though.  When I went in on Sunday, I was seated at a big circle booth.  I thought that was very cool so our group could talk and jabber a lot, but if someone had to use the bathroom, two or three people would have to get up to let someone out of the booth.  

Now to the food.  The only good thing really worth it on the appetizer menu would be the sweet corn tomale.  I just couldn't get enough of it.  I tried the other appetizers from friends and thought they just tasted alright.  Nothing too snazzy.  The entrees weren't really something to die for.  The strawberry lemonade though, whew!  ALWAYS order that sweet deliciousness with a free refill.  Even during the winter it makes me think of a nice hot summer day.  I would suggest everyone to come here for the cheesecake though since it is called \"The Cheesecake Factory.\"  Sometimes I have stopped by, only for the delightful sweets.  

All in all, this place is just A-ok for me."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food seemed a bit off for the Cheesecake Factory.  We also waited what seemed like forever for the bar drinks."}
{"text":"Long wait to be seated. Too dark to see, had to ask for the bread. It took 48 minutes to receive the food. They brought Out The Main Dish Without The side. Food was not great. Used to like it, but not worth the time."}
{"text":"Best thing about Cheesecake Factory is that the variety their menu is so big that there is a very good chance that you will find something you will like. The last few times we have come here it seems the server takes a long time to take our order but once they get it things go by pretty fast. Our food was delicious and prepared to our request and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best place to have any meal!! Breakfast/lunch or Dinner, food is slightly expensive but definitely not overpriced!! 
The staff is super awesome and very friendly.
If u visit this place during rush hours please be prepared to wait for a while but the wait is worth the quality of food and it's service!! 
Recommended food is - chicken nuggets if u are a fan of spicy food or else nachos platter with one of the best Long Island iced tea!! 
Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"5 stars THIS time because Marie C. was the best server we've ever had at this location. The food is always great, service always mediocre at best. Marie changed that today and was literally perfect. She gave us the fastest service we've ever gotten there. We didn't have to wait for anything-- drink refills, boxes, the bill, etc. and made sure that we had everything we needed. Will ask for her next time we go. Also, the chicken taquitos on the small plates menu are the best, as well as the buffalo blast appetizer. Both are must-get items. The monte cristo for Sunday brunch never disappoints either."}
{"text":"Just about the biggest menu with the most variety of anyplace I've gone. Nice ambiance, very consistent dishes, generally friendly waitstaff. Amazing deserts. I really wish that they'd take reservations though, they're always busy. Still bitter that they did away with the Shrimp Poor Boy sandwich, that was my regular dish, and they ditched it. It was cheap and delicious and huge."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the reason for this review is because of the phenomenal service! Our server Hillary T. was amazing and every server should strive to be on her level. I hope she gets some recognition from the Cheesecake Factory. She made our experience wonderful and we hope to get her as a server again in the future."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and it's a good place to go on a nice date. I prefer the places that are more casual or they have their own thing going on, but I won't hold that against The Cheesecake Factory.

This place is obviously known for their cheesecake, in case you couldn't figure that out by the name of the restaurant, so I will start by talking about what they do best and move onto the meal from there. All slices of cheesecake are big and rich enough to share. These things are huge and if you're eating one by yourself then you are either a mammoth or your pig. Don't hate! Just embrace the truth! My wife and I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, which had Hulk testicle size chunks of cookie dough inside of the cheesecake. With two big squirts of whipped cream on the top and the tip of the cheesecake to complete the imagery that I'm shooting for. It was simply amazing!

When the waitress first stopped by to ask what we would like to drink I asked for water and an Old Fashioned. To which she replied \"How hot would you like that?\" That's when I learned that one of their burgers is called The Old Fashioned. As I write this I now realize that I should have ordered The Old Fashioned to go w/ my Old Fashioned, but let me tell you what I did get before I get too carried away. I got Renee's Special which consisted of a Turkey Sandwich, the Soup of the Day (Clam Chowder) and a House Salad. Very tasty! My only complaint on the food was that the bread, I believe it was Sour Dough was too hard. Not stale or anything, just the crust was hard as a Hulk sized... ...never mind.

My Old Fashioned was very tasty and helped me take my mind off of the man taking his three disrespectful daughters out. This good man was taking his daughters out for an early Valentine's Day dinner and all three of them were on their phone and iPads. Hopefully it doesn't take him having a heart attack from the cheesecake he ate for them to realize how disrespectful they were being.

I would give 5 Strong stars but I'm going to subtract one for how close the tables were. I didn't even have to lean over to take the food from the person next to me. I wasn't trying to make friend that evening, just enjoy the company w/ my wife."}
{"text":"Great time today on Labor Day & celebrating a birthday! Seated our party of 10 quickly and efficiently. Had an all star team serving us. No problem making accommodations for our needs. Food was tasty and came hot and always plenty of it! Had to take home so much. Refills were plentiful & it was very pleasant all in all for the experience & pricing. Thanks CCF."}
{"text":"Aright, so I came here and tried the Veggie burger since my friend told me it was pretty good, and surprise! It was. 

It is an actual hand made Veggie burger full of veggie and rice and what not, though it does have a purple tint to it because of the beets, I think, it tastes just fine. It comes with fries YESSSAA which are pretty darn good and on a nice bun. It is a little soft, so some people might have it fall apart on them, but I didn't so that was good.

It really tells you something when the Cheesecake Factory can make their own Veggie burger and other places, who claim to be all down with Vegetarians, cannot."}
{"text":"The snickers cheescake is heaven I love eating dinner here because the food is great and the customer service is what I look for in a good restaurant"}
{"text":"Very long wait time (3 hours) during dinner on a Wednesday! Very very poor service, hostesses were rude, waitress was hard to get a hold of. Basic food, but amazing cheesecake. Would not return."}
{"text":"I don't get it, or rather, I do get it, but I don't care for it.  I found the wait to be longer than the food warranted, the service to be lackluster, and the prices to be, um, overly pricy.  I can see how this sort of thing appeals to the populace at large.  It comes off as a little swankier than the usual crazy stuff on the wall family establishment, and while it tries to be everything to everybody.  
You want burgers?  Sure! 
Pasta? OK! 
Cheesecake?  You betcha!   Did you catch our name on the way in?

I realize that most places don't necessarily specialize their menus, and that often the best diner-type places make it a point not to, but I found CF to be mediocre at best on all counts.  I didn't even find the food to be bad,  just not worthy of the hype, and certainly not worthy of the price.  I can think of a couple of great places off the top of my head (Joe's, My Friends) where a comparable meal (and dessert) could be had for a lot less money."}
{"text":"I just attended the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. We got in line at 11am and were told we would be seated by 12:30. Our table was ready by 12:10.  I had the California Guacamole salad and my friend had chicken teriyaki. The food was delicious and the portions too big to finish. We split the Chris's outrageous cheesecake. It was very decadent and filling - we could not finish the piece. Highly recommend if you like coconut. 

I felt compelled to write this review mostly because of how nice the staff was. Everyone was so friendly and chatty - I really appreciated this!"}
{"text":"Loveeeee loveeeee.. you can't go wrong here, everything on the menu is awesomee!!!!
The Louisiana chicken pasta is a must, but minus the chicken cause I'm a vegetarian, hehe. The skinnylious   veggie burger was phonomal, with their house salad on the side. Great vinegar sauce, ugh I can write a whole list here. Haha.

There mai tais, yummy.  Sex on the beach. ;)

RED VELVET CAKE IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I bought three 10\" cheesecakes for Christmas Eve. After standing around for almost 30 minutes, the cheesecakes were mercifully extracted from the refrigerator-freezer and I made my escape. But not before paying $165 for 3 cheesecakes. BTW, that weren't busy...at all!

I was told that they were still a bit frozen, but if I left them out for 2-3 hours, then they would be fine: \"ready to serve.\"

Not wanting to leave anything to chance, we waited SIX hours, and after SIX hours, the cheesecakes were STILL rock hard! Our children took their children home, the expensive dessert still intact. Perhaps we'll try to chisel some free at midnight.

What a waste of $165.00!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I went to the Cheesecake factory in Summerlin again to give this place another try. Last time i got hit on the head by people in the walkway. This time the server was having a bad night and FAILED to check the orders.  Nancy's plate had no sauce and nor did the salid but the crime was in the Woman's restroom,  just take a look at this mess my wife found? Im starting to look elsewhere to go for cheesecake."}
{"text":"After a long flight back to Pittsburgh, I decided to take out as oppose to buying groceries and making dinner. The South Side location like all other Cheesecake Factories that I have been to are grand in the decor. I do like the architecture on both the exterior and interior. After arriving inside, the main hostess greets me with a smile and points to where I would order out. The line was long and I was about 10-15 minutes away from getting to the front. The woman at the cashier was friendly and professional and offered the free bread with my order (yes please!). After 20 minutes, I got my eggplant sandwich with fries and bread and went home. Everything was delicious though by the time I got back to eat the sandwich it was soggy and the fries were nothing to rave about. I did as I always do enjoy the bread. Cheesecake Factory is a good restaurant that does the job (perfect to bring family since they offer many options to cater to everyone's taste buds and large portions) though I am unlikely to seek it out for a great meal."}
{"text":"We came here with no reservation and the hostess walked us to the our table right away. 

I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta!! It's so delicious! I also love their bread as appetizer. We also ordered the loaded potato tots as appetizer and it tasted alright. 

Overall I rate it a 5 stars because of their customer service!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Sunday brunch! We have gone several Sunday's now, and have never had to wait more than five minutes to be seated each visit.

The brunch offerings are plentiful (as are the portions!). The breakfast potatoes are consistently crispy and taste excellent. The lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for!

Plus, remember to have your parking slip validated by the front desk (always nice when you can't find on-street parking).

My only complaint is that sometimes the noise level makes table conversations a bit difficult to understand (but, that is to be expected given the high ceilings in the restaurant). Otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"I don't usually give negative feedback but my husband and I spent two hours and 10 minutes here for lunch today. While the food was delicious, the wait was unreasonable. The wait for a table was about 40 minutes but that was expected considering the crowd. We were seated beside an empty table and placed our order. About half an hour later a family of ten was seated beside us and we still had not received our food. We shared a waitress and she was extremely pleasant, but much more attentive to the larger party. She told us our food was coming right out three times before we got it, I honestly think she had forgotten about us. By the end of our meals, we just barely beat the other family out the door, and that's because we got our cheesecake to go. I hate to say anything bad about such a nice girl and good food, but over two hours for lunch is ridiculous."}
{"text":"So listen... it's not BAD. They're just not consistent. And when I say that, I mean it in every sense of the word. You could get something spectacular one night and order the same dish again the next night and not get the same quality.

I went there with the lady and another couple to celebrate achievements on all of our parts. The girls ordered drinks, which they thoroughly enjoyed.  And then the food came out.

I ordered...uh... some jamaican jerk thing? With chicken instead of shrimp? Jeez, it's so hard to remember when the menu is that big. I'm sure that there are a bunch of jamaican jerk things with chicken. But this one had beans and a mango pineapple salsa! And plantains!  The chicken was excellent, the slaw was good (but room temp, not cold), the beans were okay (they lacked seasoning), and the yucca was seriously overcooked. I was with my Irish buddy who had never seen plantains before and he asked me if I ordered shit (yes, they were that charred and shriveled. I gotta say, I don't blame him). However, it's really hard to mess up the internal flavor of a plantain, and overall, it was fine.

The lady ordered Fish Tacos, and she was not pleased. But I can't blame her, they had soaked the damn thing is so much sauce that the actual tortilla broke when she tried to pick it up because it was too saturated. She said it also lacked any flavor, though I didn't try it.

The cheesecake IS consistently wonderful though. I do wish they gave a weeee bit bigger slices, but what can you do. 

I do enjoy coming here, I really do, but... it never turns out to be as good as I think it's going to be. Phew. Feels good to get that off my chest."}
{"text":"Showed up for dinner at 6:50. We were seated quickly. Left at 7:15 after no one ever acknowledged us. Too bad we really like the food and the service is usually excellent. We headed over to CPK."}
{"text":"It was ok.  We were happy to be able to get into a nice place for Father's Day with no reservation.  The brunch was great for adults.  All of us enjoyed our food but things were lacking for the kids.  They only had 1 item for kids, french toast.  My older son ordered a giant belgium waffle and I was dissappointed that it was only a waffle on a plate.  No butter, whipped cream, garnish...nothing to make it special.  They had no crayons or anything to entertain the kids.  I just figured it would be a bit more kid friendly.  I will go back, but not with kids."}
{"text":"On a sunny day, we went for a lunch. We got outdoor patio seating. Avocado spring roll was really good! It is a must to get if you are an avocado lover. The green sauce that comes with was sweet and tasty. Carbonara with chicken was creamy and rich. Grilled salmon was okay. We were satisfied with our lunch under nice weather. It's been a while since I have been to this franchise Actually I didn't have high expectation on foods but our choices were good and had a nice lunch!"}
{"text":"I love CF but the Thai wraps we got tonight were not good. The chicken was a bit undercooked and mushy. It's disappointing when you have to wait so long to eat here and it's not cheap. 
The cheesecake was amazing as usual."}
{"text":"Most of their food are great! from appetizers to dessert. Definitely my go to place if I am not sure what I want to eat because they have a very diverse menu!"}
{"text":"Bar tender refused to seat is 15 minutes before the end of Happy Hour. We left for another restaurant who took care of us more professionally. Called Manager to notify him of how his regular customers were being treated and he said that he would need to verify our story with his staff. We have owned pubs in the past and would never allow this to happen."}
{"text":"So.....  I tried again and unfortunately it was worse.... The entire experience was awful.  Again, this is my favorite chain brand.    It is extremely disappointing how terrible this branch is.    So on this occasion I called ahead.   There is no way you get in line by calling in or open table, so that sucks because many restaurants this busy will have a way.     So we get and there is a 50-55 minute wait.   We wait 50 minutes and go into the restaurant and we are told 10 minutes.   In that time the people who checked in directly ahead of me were seated.   After 15 minutes I check again (I hate being that person but I don't trust the blinkly light things), and we have 2 parties ahead of me.   I am not sure how that happens because I saw the people who checked in ahead of me be seated.     Then 5 parties are seated and we are seated.     

The table, well, had no silverware or plates.   The server brought bread and water but that didn't do any good as we had no utensils.    So I got the sherperd pie again (it is my favorite) and it was better this time..... Well until I bit into a clove of raw garlic.  My mouth burned.   I am not sure how that happens..... But it did....   Then I realized that they used charred burgers (some burnt) which is strange for the price point (this isn't Wendy's chilli ya'll)....

The waitress was told about the garlic and made no correction and I talked to no managers (honestly I have no idea who it would be).    

So I tried a bite of cheesecake and couldn't even enjoy that because all I can taste is garlic.....


Honestly, I tried... But will never be at this one ever again....."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed dining at this restaurant because of the very good cakes and coffee and lovely ambiance. !"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVJCE had to wait 15 for my water and lemonade.  My DTE. burger was med well she asked for well done.  We just had cheesecake on green valley yesterday and our server was great he got  30% tip well worth it didn't have to ask for a refill lime tonight and while my daughter was drinking the leomade he waits to take the same glass says its protocol.... What the I don't belie it...WOW never coming to this location at the North Outlets again!!!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience! I placed my first to go order from this location and was placed on hold to wait for the bakery for 3 minutes. When the bakery answers, there was no greeting just a very stern voice stating \"what can I help you with?\" I asked for mozzarella sticks, MY MISTAKE. She says \"we don't serve mozzarella sticks\". I advised her that I saw them on the menu and she then says \"we have fried cheese\". I said ok I'll take those. She said is that all? And I felt rushed by her tone,  I placed two entrées in a hurry. She asked again is that all. I said yes, do I need to pay she said no. As I started to ask for my total she ended the call in my face! So I called back to speak with the manager. I was placed on hold for 5 minutes and someone else answers the phone and asked me what she could assist me with. I asked if she was the manager, I was shocked when she replied \"is that what you're holding for?\" I said yes and she placed me back on hold a couple of minutes. Andrew, the manager answered, and I explained to him why I was upset, he also seemed to be in a rush to get me off the phone so he just gave me my total and said \"anything else I can assist you with?\" Wow.. I was in shock! What started with being a simple complaint about one person, ended with me being disappointed with four people at this location that did not handle me professionally. This tells me that it was not a problem with the girl in the bakery taking my order, it's the entire culture, that's the problem. She treated me as if my service wasn't important because with a staff like that clearly she hasn't been trained to do so. I am disgusted with this location and have absolutely no intentions of ever returning. People should feel valued when they spend money with any company considering how hard we work to make a living these days. And especially with how many other wonderful places there are here in Vegas that we can choose to dine at."}
{"text":"Best to eat here if you don't mind waiting 1:30 for your meal (when you put the entire order in when you sat down) and you want to be called a liar by Joe the manager who says the meal was \"coursed out\". Because we ordered drinks and an appetizer.   Like someone tell Joe he doesn't work at Spago and this shit ain't coursed out. And don't question how long we've waited when we have proof we sat down at 8:30pm and still had no food at 10pm. Screw you, Joe the Manager. I'll give you a \"course\"....in customer service."}
{"text":"I've had good meals at Cheesecake Factory in other locations. This was expensive and unimpressive. i got a  small steak and piece of salmon abd a bit of mash.  Food was good as was the service.  I just know I  could have had better for $36 per person, elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've waited a couple visits to review The Cheesecake Factory because I've had some mediocre experiences that I thought might not have been very representative of their usual quality of service and food.  Unfortunately, my most recent visit was really unpleasant, and I feel that the mediocre experiences I've had in the past are probably as good as it can get.  

Our most recent visit was on a busy night, and the wait was about a half an hour. We were pleasantly surprised that we were seated in only about 20 minutes, but it was only down hill from there.  We ordered the grilled artichoke as an appetizer (which probably wasn't the strongest choice considering the other options), but it was inedible. I'm not a picky eater and I've never sent any dish back at a restaurant, so we didn't make a fuss, but we physically could not chew it.  When our waiter saw that we had hardly touched it and asked how it was, we just laughed and said it was inedible, but all he said was, \"hopefully your entrees are better.\" 

My boyfriend ordered the spicy cashew chicken and I ordered the chicken piccata.  My chicken was okay.  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and it only had 3 little capers on it (which is my favorite part!), but the spicy cashew chicken was really bad.  The rice was actually floating in the amount of sauce that the chicken was drenched in.  My boyfriend could hardly eat any of it.  To make things worse, we never once had our waters filled during the entire meal even though my boyfriend's water was empty after only about 20 minutes.  In addition, our waiter was very difficult to track down to get our checks, and then it was a good while once again before he took our payment.  

The only redeeming aspect of our meal was the dessert.  We ordered the red velvet cheesecake (in which we waited quite some time to order it and then have it brought to our table), but it was delicious! I will probably opt out of ever dining here again, but I might order the cheesecake for takeout."}
{"text":"Most people have gone to The Cheesecake Factory and will rave about their food and desserts. One tip, please try the combination Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane. You owe it to yourself, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheesecake!!!!! But they are not just doing desserts. They have a full menu. First time I ate here was couple weeks ago since my boss(thanks boss) gave me a gift card. I have had their cheesecake from friends who picked up dessert for birthdays and such.

It's perfect for families and for those date nights. It can be noisy but when me and my girlfriend arrived the waitress sat us in the corner and we felt all alone. 

My girlfriend went with some basic chicken fingers but I did the Shepard's pie and boy was it sooo good. It was full of flavor and perfect for a cold day. The serving was soooo big which is not a bad thing. I ate all of it and when it came to dessert time the slice of cheesecake was huge!! I got the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was a perfect for a sweet tooth! My girlfriend couldn't finish hers but I ate all of mine ha ha.

Edit: I can't believe I forgot that we started with mini crab cakes. They were good and this is from someone who doesn't eat much crab except for sushi.

The food and service was good. The prices were not bad for the amount of food you get. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"This place is famous for its huge portions and, of course, cheesecakes. I used to love going there and eating a big bowl of the Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya and then washing it down with a fat slice of cheesecake or Linda's Fudge cake. Nowadays, I choose to eat healthier and this place doesn't fit my needs anymore. Once in a blue moon I would stop in for a slice of cheesecake or Linda's, but even that became disappointing as it seemed their slices have gotten smaller yet their prices have gone up. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, but I think we're done."}
{"text":"The Southside location is just amazing.  Our waitress Tasha was fabulous, very personable and knowledgeable about the menu.  This was my husband's and I's first time here and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Holy Hell, is that a menu or a novel, no matter how many times I go to the cheesecake factory every time they set down the bible of all menus on my table I start feeling like I should have shown up earlier to study my choices and then I end up ordering the same thing anyways. The overall feel of this place is great, yes it is a chain and yes they all look the same but one difference with this place in comparison to other chains is that they are always spot on with the food. 

The other thing about this place is that it is obviously named due to it's insane cheesecake options but i never have room for cheesecake when we are done eating here due to the amount of food you are given when you order a normal size meal. 

On this specific trip the food was fast, delicious and more than enough, i think for the time being this is our location of choice if we are going to be hitting the cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"I do not know what there is to not like. (Take that you high school English teachers!)

Sometimes it takes a while to be seated. True all over the Valley these days.

The servers are always friendly and check in frequently enough.

The quantity of food is just stupid big. From burgers, to steaks, to Italian and Asian, the kitchen gets everything pretty much good enough.

And the desserts. Wait for it... I simply cannot stand cheesecake. Hate it. Always have. So why Cheesecake Factory? Because the people I come here with love cheesecake. And, this place does it better than pretty much anywhere. For me, the chocolate cakes and brownie desserts do a fine job. The last brownie a'la mode I had, went home with me. Other than the ice cream which had to be eaten in the restaurant, the brownie last 3 more servings at home."}
{"text":"A rock solid performance! Very happy.

Clean. Friendly, prompt, attentive service.

Ahi entree was superb. Very good quantity. Perfect sear. Excellent wasabi in the rice. Bacon bacon burger cooked correctly as ordered.

The desserts never disappoint."}
{"text":"So.......we wanted to go out to lunch, but we didn't want to spend a lot of money.  Remembered that we had received some gift cards from the in laws for the Cheesecake Factory.  Problem solved!  I had not yet been to this Cheesecake Factory since moving out to AZ.  We would go to the one in Mission Valley occasionally and the food/service was usually pretty good.  We came down here to this one today for a late lunch.

We arrived at around 3:00 and there weren't too many people there.  We got a seat immediately at a table and the waitress brought over the high chair.  We placed our order for drinks (waters, and my wife got an iced tea), got some bread delivered (sourdough and a honey oat type brown bread) and placed our order.  I had been scoping out the Yelp reviews and pictures online prior to arrival, and I saw a few pictures of fish tacos.  I had yet to have fish tacos since I moved to AZ, and they looked legit, and sounded legit, so I went with those.  My wife got a lunch sized portion of the pasta carbonara with chicken.  About 15 minutes later, our food was arrived.  Here is how it was..................

Fish Tacos-  These things looked great!  They hook you up with 4 nice sized tacos!  They came with double wrapped corn tortillas, a nice piece of tempura fried white fish which was both crunchy outside and moist inside,  some pickled onions and a little dollop of guacamole.  They usually come with a chipotle sauce, but I skipped that.  The tacos were mighty fine as they were.  Everything worked well!  They were legit fish tacos.  Maybe not as good as TJ Oyster Bar in SD, but they were damn good and better than a lot of fish tacos I have had.  I really liked the pickled onions!  They gave a nice little sweetness to the taco and they were buried under the actual fish.  These tacos were well constructed and just the right size to fill me up but not overstuff me.  The tacos also came with some black beans, and a side of \"green tint\" rice.  I sampled the beans, they were alright.  The rice had a unique seasoning to it.  Almost tasted a bit like pesto sauce, but then I caught a taste of something else.  Definitely unique, but I didn't finish all of it, mostly because I'm not the hugest fan of rice and/or beans.

Pasta Carbonara-  My wife thought it was a bit too \"oily\" so she couldn't finish it all.  I took her bowl of pasta from her and proceeded to have some.  I thought it was fine!  It had a nice sauce, lots of bacon, a little bit of chicken and a ton of peas in it.  I am anti pea, so I ate around all of those.  The noodles, bacon, sauce and chicken were very good.  I couldn't see myself eating a whole bowl of this (reason my wife couldn't finish it either) because it was pretty heavy, but a half portion or if you split this with someone, it was pretty tasty.

Service was fine.  Not great, not poor.  A-OK!  Total for everything was $0.00 thanks to the gift cards!  We skipped dessert and were on our way.  I would definitely come back and probably order the same thing.  Those fish tacos were no joke!  They were delicious as could be!"}
{"text":"Can I just say something... DISAPPOINTED!!!
Food isn't that great and the cheesecake is mediocre at best! 
Yes... it tastes good! But sure as hell isnt worth $9 for one freakin slice. Literally anywhere that serves cheesecake is just as good. 
$4 for one slice would be reasonable. As it stands, I will never be returning to this overpriced poor excuse for delicious food. Hard pass."}
{"text":"Do people only come here for birthdays?
Overrated.  Poor service.  OK food.  Decent cheesecake.  Unorganized, extremely long wait times.  Came here on a Monday night; got the buzzer; waited 1 hr 50 min.  Once we were buzzed, I sprinted to the front desk from Top Shop and almost rolled my ankle, and the hostess told us we had lost our reservation for 7 because it was the 2nd time they buzzed us.  Please note that the buzzer VIBRATES and flashes, like this ain't no amateur hour weak vibrator; there's no way one can miss being buzzed.  This buzzer can cause carpal tunnel syndrome!  We were told there was nothing they could do and had to wait another 20 min. before being seated.  We asked if there were any birthday freebies because we were celebrating a birthday, and the waitress stated, \"We get like 45 birthdays a day; we'd go broke if we gave something for free for birthdays.\"  Seriously?  Not even a 'Happy Birthday' from the waitress!  When asked if the fish tacos can be made half half (2 fried/2 grilled), she said 'No.'  What kind of customer service is this?!  Also, when you ask for medium rare steak, they will bring you a well-done steak, so ask for blue/really rare steak if you want medium rare.  Definitely not worth the wait.  In conclusion, I think people come here only for birthdays.  They sang Happy Birthday at a frequency of once every 10 min.  We were seated for 90 min. and there were 9 birthday songs.  Will not be returning... until the next birthday!"}
{"text":"Safe quality service and I'm sorry Arizona but I can't find another restaurant that can compete... So sad to say..."}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting today and my lunch companions suggested \"the Cheese\".
So, off I went.
I've been to this location and to the Cheesecake Factory in NoSco a number of times over the years, but a fresh visit at lunch today gives me a reason to review Cheesecake Factory.
We've all been there, right? The food is pretty good, they have a big, giant, varied and eclectic menu (thank you messieurs Roget). You get a metric ton of food for the price (I brought approx. 2/3 of my club sandwich home with me and my puppy couldn't be happier, plus, I couldn't begin to eat all the fries).
No room for cheesecake on this visit or I would tossing and turning at my desk all afternoon.
I don't think the food is really the point with Cheesecake Factory. The lunch was nice, the food tasted good, and the atmosphere was really very pleasant.
The service was good, prompt, attentive and friendly. There just isn't anything that stands out about Cheesecake factory to make me want to give them more than an average rating. They do lots of things pretty well, but if I wanted great fried chicken, I'd go to Lolo's...if I wanted a great steak, I'd run up to the Fairmont...you get the idea.
So, pretty good, esp. for a chain, with good service and good price points and more food than you haul in wheelbarrow!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is amazing. The staffs are friendly and sweet. I came here on my birthday after watching a movie at GV. I felt really bad for coming in late since they were about to close within an hour. I know how it feels because I work in the industry myself... Anyways, our waitress was really kind and she did a great job. The food was amazing and served well. I ordered Thai Glazed Salmon and I must say it was delicious and I'm not really a salmon fan. Kudos! I'm definitely coming back and bringing more friends with me! Time to try everything on the menu. Especially the cheesecakes!!!"}
{"text":"When people say, \"The Cheesecake Factory\", what I hear is \"The Diarrhea Refinery\"."}
{"text":"Excellent as always. I have always been a huge fan of TCF and have eaten at many locations. There is almost ALWAYS a wait at this location, no matter the time. We arrived around 1230 and told a 20 minute wait, it was around 25. I am in love with the asian lettuce tacos and the pear, blue cheese and pecan flatbread on the skinnylicious menus. Friend had the chopped salad also off the skinnylicious menu... we were both in heaven and had leftovers. The service was good and the food came out quickly... it helps having an idea of what you want before you go because the menu is huge."}
{"text":"It's not that the food is bad (it's good) but it's overpriced. If I weren't worried at all about money I'd come here, though, because the atmosphere is fun and friendly, and it's great for two people or a group.  Obviously the cheesecakes are delish, as are their other desserts.  The menu is HUGE with a large variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday around 11 am. We waited around an hour and a bit. When we got the buzzer we were given an estimated time of an hour to an hour and a half, so we did a bit of shopping and checked in around the one hour mark to see how much longer the wait would be. We waited maybe another 15 minutes in the vicinity of the restaurant and sure enough it buzzed.

I ordered the lunch pasta carbonara and it was amazing. It was a bit heavy, as most cream sauces usually are, but the seasoning was spot on and I packed up the leftovers which made for another full meal. 

I shared the godiva cheesecake with a couple of friends and it was very rich in flavour. It was tasty but would have been too sweet to eat on my own. I also got the strawberry cheesecake original to bring home and share with my family. We ended up leaving it in the fridge overnight and it still tasted good the next day. 

All in all, I would go back but probably only for lunch. The first time I went it was a 4 hour wait and we didn't end up eating until 8pm, so it's definitely worth it to go earlier and minimize the wait."}
{"text":"The best experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. After Carmines down the hall completely dropped the ball and lost 5 regulars, Cheesecake Factory completely saved our night out. The food was better than it normally is. It's always delicious but tonight our normal favorite dishes were absolutely flawless. The staff was top notch too! Especially the manager on duty who fixed a minor table issue, and our waitress who felt like a friend hosting a party. Unfortunately I did not get their names.
This location has always been a consistently good option, but after tonight, it's become one of our top dining choices on the strip."}
{"text":"My tip is to think about what time you ideally want to eat, and then start lining up 3 hours earlier. Even if the lineup looks short, you can probably expect to wait at least 2 hours, just given the way their process is set up. The good thing about this location is that it's in a mall, so you can walk around the shop while you wait. However, the buzzer doesn't work if you go too far, so you'll want to stay close to the restaurant when it's close to your estimated time.

Other than that, it's a very standard Cheesecake Factory inside. For anyone who hasn't been, that means the same extensive menu (hundreds of options!), same affordable prices, same huge portions, same rich, decadent cheesecake. I would recommend the pasta napoletana - lots of meat (sausage, pepperoni, meatballs), and rich, hearty ingredients and flavours, served with angel hair pasta and a sauce that is both creamy and tomato-y. The chicken madeira is also really good. The chicken breast is not dry at all and is topped with melted cheese for that extra comfort food-vibe and cheesy goodness. I would not recommend the shrimp scampi. It's sauteed shrimp served with angel hair pasta and sounds delicious, but we found it was kind of bland and there wasn't enough sauce, so the noodles were dry.

My mom finished her shrimp scampi dish (even though she didn't really like it, so I think the portion size was also smaller than others), but both my dad and I had leftovers to take home from our pasta napoletana and chicken madeira. I think I had about half of my pasta left and he had a third of his chicken left, so it's definitely good value for your money because you'll have meals for the next day! Also the free bread they give you is delicious (the brown one especially), and it is unlimited refills."}
{"text":"They are so consistent at all of thief places. Even the one in Waikiki is great, although the wait can be very long at that one."}
{"text":"My experience on Wednesday makes me unable to say more than 3 stars and the drop of stars is exclusively about the questionable service.

I am on a diet and I was excited to discover the SkinnyLicious Menu.  The lettuce mexican chicken tacos are only 250 calories.  How often do you find such good diet options at a restaurant?  

My friend was already seated when I arrived.  It took between 5 and 8 minutes for the waitress to show up and ask me for my drink order.  Since I had been sitting there for so long, we were both ready to order when she arrived.

Then came the wait for the food.  Again, I had the lettuce tacos and she had a chicken sandwich with fries.  We sat there for 20 minutes waiting for our food.  

We enjoyed the food, but again came the wait for the waitress to return so we could ask for the check.  Then the wait for her to come back and pick the check.  At this point, I had to bail and go back to work.  I gave my friend cash.  I also advised her to just pay and go to the front to get her piece of cheesecake she wanted to take home.  (She told the waitress at the time of ordering that she wanted to take a piece of cheesecake home.  Apparently, the waitress didn't want the tip on the cheesecake.)

Food 5, service 2-3"}
{"text":"Called and ordered for takeout. I was told our food would be ready in 30 minutes. Well, we ended up waiting over an hour. I get that it was busy but if they would have given me a more accurate wait time we would have gone and got food somewhere else. Our entrees were ready, we were mostly sitting around waiting for cheesecake. So our nice hot dinner was sitting there getting cold while we were waiting for a good 30 minutes for a chilled dessert. Makes sense, right? And to top it all off, we get home only to realize our side orders were missing. We will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Traveling through Vegas with my Family back to California from Utah and chose to visit Caesar's. Family voted to eat at Cheesecake Factory. Got sat right away and Destiny was our Server. Prompt and attentive. However, our order took way too long. Noticed several tables seated after us getting their food and even finishing their meals before we even got our entrées. Even though we had an appetizer it  still shouldn't have taken that long. An hour after we first sat down we finally got our entrées. Apparently my wife's sandwich was made wrong and keeping the rest of our order from being delivered, and was the last to arrive to the table. The server apologized and the manager also came to our table to apologize. I suggested to the manager Someone should at least communicate that our order is being delayed and/or at least bring my kids food. He stated that the kitchen didn't communicate to him about the issue. While the food was good, when we got the check we saw that nothing was compensated for the issue. When you take responsibility for the issue that was clearly affecting the guests you should show some sort of compensation for the downward experience. We paid the full check and left 15% for the server as issue with the kitchen wasn't her fault. She should recognize when her first table is sitting with no food while the tables sat after were eating or paying their check."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing restaurant, amazing service! Just outside of the restaurant there is a show that happens every hour or so which you can view from your seat. All in all  one of the better cheesecake factories."}
{"text":"Good service. Tyler was good. 1 water refill, but other than that we were taken care of. Food is subpar. No bread basket at all, but I guess that's ok. We brought the kids for the first time & they loved the cheesecake, but their meals were just \"alright\". Honey had the soup, sandwich & salad. Sandwich was piled high, but lacked flavor. Salad was standard Caesar. The soup was good, but we didn't find any of the artichoke that was supposedly in there. Cobb salad had way too much egg & not enough lettuce. I hate that they let people dining in park in the spaces designated for take out...that's a pet peeve of mine. Overall for the price it wasn't great."}
{"text":"I wish I knew about this website a few months ago. 

My family and I had great experience at other cheesecake factory. This location was a total upset. We made reservation ahead of time for twelve people and the staff rest assured that they can accomodate that much.

Our reservation was supposed to be at 6:00 pm, but we weren't seated until 7:00 p.m. At this point, the men in the family were all upset, but still had to go in, for the sake of the ladies. So we followed the staff to an area, but only to find out that they didn't have our table ready. We were told that we will be scattered or to be sitted in different tables...even though we had a party of twelve. By this time, I was really angry. I wasn't able to hold myself in, I freaked out. They were supposed to find a way to meet our needs. Like they say, customers are always right. But the unorganized staff didn't deliver at all. Everyone in my family were upset because of what was going on and we were suppose to have a great time since it was my daughter's birthday. Anyway, as mentioned the staff were just horrible. We didn't get our drinks in a five minute time frame, but instead longer. It took us even longer to order and to get our food. The most irritating part, they messed up on some of the orders and didn't even apologize. Since I am very carefree, I asked one of the staff for the manager. I told the manager that we weren't happy and that, he had the worst staff any person can imagine.Out of all the cheesecake factory (at the ceasar's forum) staff, the manager, I believe was, the only one who was decent to actually care about his job and the reputation of the restaurant. 

Skip this place when you are in Las Vegas. The worst restaurant ever. I would rate this place half a star."}
{"text":"Our appetizer and main course came cold. Our server forgot about us for a good 20 minutes while we waited for the check. I've had great service here before but not today."}
{"text":"This location is always busy and you can get easily overlooked if you aren't efficient when asking for the next thing you need when your server comes- for example when they take your drink order and come back with drinks you should be ready to order, when they check on how the food is you should ask for box/order cheesecake.  When they bring boxes or cheesecake ask for the check. The food is great here, very consistent. Love the Oreo dream cheesecake, fried macaroni and cheese, chicken piccata, banana cheesecake etc."}
{"text":"If you can't find anything you like in what appears to be the largest menu in the world....something is wrong with you.

I haven't made it to dessert in the last 5 times I have been here.  I usually get an appetizer and the cajun jambalaya pasta.  There have been a couple of times where I was lead astray and ordered something else but I just ended up regretting it going back to the pasta dish.  

Some of my coworkers eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Meh! Server was great, but not my scene. Too dark to read the menu, the menu looked like a novel there were so many pages, and everything was overpriced for the quality. It was ok at best, but you can find much better food in the area."}
{"text":"Was here last night for my friend's birthday dinner and had a blast. Despite the host attempting to seat us at an awkward corner, the experience was great once we got seated in a private booth. The food was amazing  (parmigian grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables) as well as the sherly temple I had as a beverage. Second time coming to this establishment  (first time in Virginia Beach) and will definitely come back again....mainly for the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I had the greatest server I could have possibly asked for tonight!!! Great food and great service. If you ever get a chance, go in and ask for Caitlyn! We sat there for almost 2 hours and she was very sweet and outgoing. Definitely going back just for her."}
{"text":"I never been to the Cheesecake Factory so we decided go here. We had a fairly large group which included four kids all under the age of 5. The service was really nice and attentive. The overall atmosphere here is very loud which probably makes it good for large groups/noisy families. If you want more of an intimate atmosphere for maybe a \"date night\" then this is not for you. Food was tasty. Portion size very large even for lunch portions. Would come here again."}
{"text":"First off horrible  service! Second got put in a booth and it was disgusting! Floor was all dirty under us and the cushions were all sticky! We ordered appetizers and my Mac and cheese balls were burnt! I found a hair in the calamari. Got our entrees and jst didn't taste good at all! I literally went home and threw up. I have went to cheesecake before and had an average time but the last time got me saying I will never go again just thinking about the food I ate make me gag"}
{"text":"This location is fantastic!  There is tons if great shopping that can be had prior to your cheesecake fulfilling experience.  Some things I would like to mention about the restaurant:
-The waitstaff are extremely nice and very helpful.  You will never worry about your cup going dry!  They also get the food to you in a hurry so that it doesn't every get cold, if it isn't supposed to be, waiting to arrive at your table.  
-The bathrooms are always clean and fully stocked.  
-The bar is an awesome area where the bartender is super nice and can help you pick the perfect cocktail to complement your choice of cheesecake (or food).
-The food ranges from pasta to salads to seafood to anything you can think of.  There is no shortage of options when it comes to this menu!!  
Lastly, the music they play is always best enjoyed on the outside patio on a nice afternoon with a glass of wine.  The patio is my choice of seating!!  

My only critical review would be that the waiter who brought our cheesecakes to our table reeked of cigarette smoke.  Not such a big fan of the stuff and kind of makes me nauseated.  (Not really a feeling I'm going for after stuffing my face with awesome food)

Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying it takes a lot for me to right a bad review. 

My first bad experience happened back in December of 2014. I love cheesecake's salmon and I ordered it this time like I do every other time. It tasted awesome, but I regretted it later on that night. I was sick and throwing up from it from about 9pm until 1 or 2am (and I was getting on a flight to Mexico at 6!) luckily it wasn't full on food poisoning or I would've missed my trip! 

My second bad experience happened last night. We placed a to go order for two southwest chicken sandwiches and a slice of cheesecake. When we arrived to pick up our order there were 3 other people standing around looking pissed and waiting for their orders. We waited about 15 minutes before one of the employees came over to us and told us that they could not find our order in their system. We then waited another 15 minutes for them to find the order (the order taker put it under Taylor even though I spelled my name out to her over the phone, she obviously wasn't listening). Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received the food. If you are counting that's 45 minutes waiting for a pick up order. 
We got home and ate the food.... The fries were soggy, the sandwiches were luke warm, and the marshmallow on top of our lemon cheesecake was melted and unrecognizable (but still tasty).
Fast forward 2 hours and we were both sick. I took pepto and thankfully was fine but my boyfriend was not so lucky. He has full on food poisoning!!!! 

We will NEVER eat at Cheesecake Factory EVER again."}
{"text":"The quality of the food+service is always good and consistent.  Certainly everything The Cheesecake Factory offers is well above average and satisfying.  The food portions continue to be more than fair.  We noticed that menu prices have moderately increased over the last few years, most likely a result of higher food costs."}
{"text":"So I have eaten here bunches of times and the Caesars location too. But this was a different experience. My boyfriend surprised me, taking me here, but because he dislikes coconut and I swore that the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake would change his mind, he was willing to taste it. 4 stars because seriously TAKE RESERVATIONS. AT LEAST DO A RESERVE WAIT LIST for people who are courteous enough to call ahead. On a Friday night at peak hours, our 2 top took 15 minutes to seat outside but the front was sooo crowded, 4-5 sets w kids in tow. The weather was beautiful and all the food wonderful as usual. I had a Greek salad that was good but would have been better without the wilted greens and the Pear & Bleu Cheese flatbread we shared. So yummy, that flatbread could be an appetizer at every meal. Dinner was Parmesan Crusted Chicken (may not be listed exactly like that, sorry) for me and he got the Stuffed Cheddar Burger(again may not be actual name). Also per usual for my pics, we've taken bites already! He also asked them to do a lil Happy Birthday thing, which yes super sweet but I don't like that attention. He really liked the cheesecake btw. Great service. I apologize for not remembering our lady server's name but she had A Lot of tables and was a total pro!"}
{"text":"The times I've been here I've come for birthday parties and group dinners but really, it's a much better place for small groups. It gets really busy and loud. You might have to wait a little for dinner.

The food is good, cheesecake is delicious and service is okay. (With service, sometimes you'll get the most caring, attentive server or at other times someone who only comes to bring food and give you the check. eh. Not that big a deal to me. :)) Most of all I love love love that brown bread in the basket. Oo. :D I get 2nds of that all the time. :) 

be wary, this place is pricey and isn't always worth what you pay but it's still good!"}
{"text":"One of my favs , staff outstanding, 150 sauces made daily,  a book for a menu ,and then there is the cheesecake if u'v got room. Enjoy ."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat before a show.  We got seated fairly quickly as there wasnt much of a wait.  The menu has changed a lot since I've last eaten at this chain.  I went for a chicken dish which was breaded chicken with pasta topped with tomato sauce.  It was pretty tasty but as usual the portion was huge!  The fettuccine alfredo was also pretty good as well.  The service here was good and polite!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here on a Monday night - tried the Chicken Madeira which was delicious - it came with asparagus and mushrooms with a yummy sauce and mashed potatoes - really good. Service was OK - not the best, waiter was very busy, but very nice, so nothing to complain about.

This is one of my favorite chain restaurants - they have a huge variety to choose from both in food and drinks and their cheesecake is so good. Mondays are a good day - they were busy but not crazy busy - and there was no wait, which is good because if I can't make reservations I usually don't go to a restaurant if there is a wait.

Wine is overpriced - but I am not surprised.

I recommend the Godiva chocolate and white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake - they are amazing."}
{"text":"Again I don't like waiting for my food, so when I started going in to this location there was a few seats open at the bar, so my girlfriend and I sat down. The bar staff there was amazing, like more amazing than the regular wait staff there. I am always amazed that they have to memorize the menu, the whole menu and get special long training to be able to work there. I am not sure the bartender's name but he has long hair and is very friendly and definitely a Great Waiter/Bartender, you just don't find many these days. The food is always good, no matter what Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, but I just wanted to comment on the bar staff and their extraordinary friendly and knowledgeable service they offer."}
{"text":"Not my first time at this location: service is always very knowledgeable (their menu is a novel) 

The server was very busy when we got there so he created us and said he would be right back.

Got our drinks and then let us decide. 
We ordered the artichoke crab dip (came out hot) but it wAs a tad too fishy. 

I definitely think the wine prices are WAY too high for the name brand they are selling. We spent $50 in drinks and only had two a piece.

We both ordered the ribeye and was cooked perfect!! I always get their grilled asparagus (fantastic) instead of green beans.  UP charge btw

The bread basket they give u is also fresh and warm. 

So full at the end I had to take cake home. We will be back but not soon. Just so pricey for two."}
{"text":"Okay who would even complain about this place?? the food is beyond delicious and amazing and the service is always friendly and nice! No complaints for this place! I would eat here everyday if i could!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of chains, but I got a gift card for Christmas. I was surprised that they had a decent gluten free menu, including gf bread/buns and pasta. I ordered gf pasta tossed with veggies and pine nuts, enough for 3 portions. It was good and all of the vegetables were cooked nicely. The appetizer was tamale cakes topped with corn, avocado, and sour cream. They were tasty, but heavy and filling. For dessert I ordered the Godiva flour less cheesecake, the only gf cheesecake on the menu. It was great!

Drinks and wines are grossly over priced and the price is something like $10.89 or $7.50 ... Anything with cents in the price bugs me. There was only a 10 minute wait for a table and the ginormous bar was practically empty, and made out wait more comfortable. Overall, service was ok, food was ok."}
{"text":"This place can be an absolute nightmare to get to as it's at the very, very, very back of the forum shops, but it's worth it.

The food is normal Cheesecake Factory fare-the menu is huge. I went for the California Cheesesteak and enjoyed it. No cheesecake this time around, but looking around and seeing folks eating it, it looked delicious.

Our server was awesome. Despite juggling a lot of tables during a busy lunch hour, he was on top of his game and got everything right. He really impressed.

This is a good choice for lunch or dinner, especially if you're staying in Caesar's."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory in general and I think this is a very good location. It is huge, at the mall, very clean, and I always have friendly servers. I think some of the food options are not worth the price, but for the most part you get big portions especially on the salads and pastas. Huge menu to the point where it's almost overwhelming but at least there's an option for everyone. Caesar salad is my favorite food and Cheesecake Factory has my favorite caesar salad. Only thing I do not like about this location is it is SO dark. It is beyond the point of ambiance, I feel like I have to strain my eyes to read the menu. Been here probably 100 times and will continue to go to this location."}
{"text":"So we have come to Cheesecake Factory several times and really enjoyed this place. Great food and service \"usually\". Today on Mothers Day was an exception. The service sucked and my daughter had a fly in her food. Now I understand these things happen and I know that, but what I really had an issue was the lack of concern. They took the plate and said sorry, that they would re-fire a new one right away. Then the waitress comes back and tells us that she put the order in on \"the Fly\" I didn't think that pun was funny at all. She tells us that the manager would come over and that they would take her plate off the bill. 15 minutes went by with no food. I saw the manager walk by us 2 different times and never stopped to talk to us. The lack of concern just pissed me off. My wife loved this place and only ate half her food cold due to losing her appetite. This was supposed to be part of her Mother's Day. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for jacking that up. The manager never came over to apologize. After the family left I asked for the manager. Once he arrived I explained my situation and he said he knew nothing about it. He did apologize and they did take that dish off my bill. Nice work...our waiter never even told him. I told him he lost a customer and he really didn't even seem concerned. Thing is, that area has lots of restaurant choices and lots come and go. With service like this we will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came here for my daughters birthday and had the best time. Our waiter Austin was amazing , he made my daughters cheesecake personalized for her birthday and made us feel at home. The food was amazing and we will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today, fried calamari, a burger & Chinese chicken salad.  Hubs and I took home cheesecake, of course.  Peter, our server was so nice, very efficient and put up with a lot of grief from some German tourists next to us.  It's a busy place but the food is concistantly good.  Note to self: always valet park, the parking garage is packed!"}
{"text":"The salmon was gross. Had it simply grilled and it tasted extremely fishy.  I eat fish almost every night (out) and this was unacceptable.  Waiter asked how it was, I told him, tasted bad, no response.  Veggies also came with butter.  Ordered no butter. Never again.  I'll go to Bella Vita for fresh fish:)"}
{"text":"This chain is always reliable. I don't go often, maybe once a year or two.  It does have good food, good service, and good dessert. I tend to get overwhelmed by the menu though! They have everything from american to mexican to asian. It is a bit crazy if you think about it. 

I ordered the lunch everything pizza, which comes with a salad this time. The portion was huge! This one order is certainly two meals in one. It was very good! I know the bowtie pasta dish is good as well. 

This was the first time I had the banana pudding cheesecake with fresh banana slices. It was amazing! Not too sweet. In fact it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Where to start...The Cheesecake Factory is like an old stand by with decent food & decent service. I visit this restaurant about 4 times a year. This past visit was probably one of the worst. Ok, maybe it was the worst.
I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. $16.95. This is one of my favs but this time the chicken was a bit over cooked. I'm not a fan of dry chicken. The rest of the dish was ok.
K ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. $17.95. She had to ask for additional sauce because it came out with very little sauce. At least they didn't charge us for it. The sauce was good. The rice was a bit on the undercooked side. The chicken was fine.
C ordered the Buffalo Strips $9.99. $10.99 with fries. This is a great deal. 8 large breaded chicken tenders for $9.99. An extra buck for fries. Heck of a deal.
Grandma C ordered the Carolina BBQ sandwich. $12.95. She didn't eat it because it was chunked pork, not pulled.
Now the bad stuff;
First off, charging $4.50 for a Strawberry lemonade for my son is RIDICULOUS. Second, I think $7.50, $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake is too much. Especially when the whole cheesecake is around $50. And lastly, the Carolina BBQ sandwich is described as being made with pulled pork. It is not. It is made with pork chunks. Not very good for a sandwich. We told the manager we were not pleased with the sandwich but in the middle of our debate on the merits of pulled pork vs pork chunks the fire alarm went off. FOR 10+ MINUTES. (We learned from a server that the key needed to turn off the alarm was taken home by one of the new managers. So the fire dept was on it's way to turn off the alarm) I think a good portion of the guests left after a few minutes because the ear piercing blaring noise of the fire alarm was a bit much to take. We stayed. I was hoping to finish our conversation with the manager but he never returned. We also had hoped that the pork sandwich would be taken off the bill. It wasn't. And we hoped that the Mgr would buy a slice of cheesecake to make up for the sandwich. He didn't. We sat through that blaring alarm for nothing except for an \"I can't believe you stayed\" from our server. You know what? I can't believe we stayed either.
I did find it interesting when the server mentioned about the Mgr taking the key home she told us they had 4 new managers. Hmmm. Wonder Y.
Management & food; 2 stars."}
{"text":"C's birthday dessert. After we had eaten dinner at another location, C wanted to come here for his birthday dessert. We were sat immediately and our server was Victoria T. She was great. Attentive, on point, pleasant and not intrusive. Kudos.
So the birthday boy C got the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake ($7.95). He loved it. Personally, I didn't think it had enough cream cheese flavor and was too sweet but that's just me. They wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate on his plate so he felt special.
K had the Lemon Meringue Cheese Cake ($7.95). She loved it. I didn't taste it but she said it had very nice lemony flavor and had really good texture.
Grandma C had the Tiramisu Cheese Cake ($7.95). Her only comment was Yum.
I had Carrot Cake ($7.95). OK, enough of the laughing. I'm not the biggest fan of commercial Cheesecake because it never has enough cream cheese in it. And since there was going to be 3 Cheesecakes on the table, why add a fourth. Plus, I love good Carrot Cake. For the most part, The Cheesecake Factory does a good job with all their desserts so I never feel like it's going to be a bad decision not to go with a Cheesecake. My Carrot cake was very good. A tad on the dry side but that's probably because once the cake is sliced, one side of the next piece is going to begin to dry out. The cake still has good flavor, was moist enough and there were noticeable pieces of Carrots within the cake. The frosting is also pretty good although for me it's a little too sweet and could use a little more cream cheese flavor. All in all, very good though.
Great service, reasonable pricing, great desserts. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"TWO HOURS.....REALLY???
On a Wednesday evening, it should not take two hours to get dinner. It should not take 20 minutes to get a glass of wine. They were not busy; there was no waiting. We arrived at 5:00. We didn't leave until 7:00. When we brought it to the attention of the mgr., he said, next time bring it to my attention sooner. There won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Great food here. We had steak and cheesecake. Sat in the bar to avoid long wait time. Good experience."}
{"text":"The only time I visit the Cheesecake factory is for lunch. Normally this place gets very crowded and you have to wait for a table.
I love the warm brown seed bread they serve with their meals. The lunch time portions are almost as large as the dinner portions but is quite filling.
You do have to pay for parking but if you park in the garage they will validate you for $2.00 off your ticket.
As far as the cheesecake goes, it's fair. I have had genuine NY cheesecake that lays on my stomach. This type is ok but not what I am used to.
I normally will visit when family and friends want to go there but it isn't a place I would choose for myself."}
{"text":"My city has two Cheesecake factory restaurants. I have eaten at both and they are identical. My first recommendation is to get there when it opens otherwise you will be waiting quite some time for a seat.

Normally when I eat there I go for lunch since they serve huge portions. I normally order a lunch salad and it is so huge I really can't eat much more of anything else. They do serve two kinds of bread with your meal. My favorite is the brown bread with white seeds on top.

They do have various cheesecakes in a cooler case when you enter so you can see the various types. You can also purchase them for takeout. They are very filling but the are NY style. Believe me it isn't authentic but the next best thing to it.

I usually end up taking food home since they serve large portions. Keep in mind this is a chain restaurant and you can find it in various cities."}
{"text":"The Avocado Appetizer if phenomenal! The reason for the 3 star review is due to the wait time when we came in with the family at 7PM. We were told it was 20mim wait, however after the 40min wait we decided to go up to the hostess and were seated upon complaining. Upon going to our table, we saw so many tables that were empty and ready to serve hungry customers.

The food was great, however like most places the pasta dishes are served with about 2lbs of pasta and 5 pieces of chicken. The best part of the meal were the appetizers, the dessert, and the service."}
{"text":"Everything is so good here. Staff is very courteous. The Quality  of food was wonderful and the Establishment was up lifting and clean m."}
{"text":"The service here sucks. I was here with two of my friends and the server didn't even give us utensils after giving our food 30 minutes later. She served the chips/gauc with the rest of the food, which we ordered as an appetizer. In addition, they were out of everything that we got DRY fish tacos with no dressing. The server also brought a birthday dessert with no spoon. worst service ever."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 to be nice, rounding up since I already rated it 3 for our previous experience. However, given our waitress was accommodating and nice, we'll be a little more generous in our rating. 

We came back, this time it was to celebrate a friend's last day in Madison (goodbye, farewell, definitely come back to visit!) and another friend's belated birthday, so we had a large crowd of 15. 

Friends arrived around 7:30PM and waited patiently till 8:15 before we were finally seated (it was the double seat tables in the back by the kitchen grouped together into two larger separate tables - we went ahead and just combined the separation, the reasoning was since it was a curved seating, it didn't fully align but having it separate seemed more awkward). 

Given our large party, the waitress took down our drink orders and then came back shortly after for our food order. In a little while, all the food arrived in what seemed like a shorter period of time than when we were waiting for food the other day. 

The food itself was just okay. Again still overpriced for the quality of food we received, but nonetheless, edible and delicious especially if you're starving. We didn't finish our meals till 9:30PM, given how long it took to seat us and then a few friends orders cheesecakes and other desserts.

For our belated friend's birthday, they even provided a free fudge dessert (she ended up not eating it since she already ordered tiramisu cake but another friend happily gobbled it up). 

When it came to the bill, the two friends meals that we were out to celebrate were split onto the remaining bills. However, one item was only split onto two bills, waitress was nice enough to have this as a separate bill and allowed us to chip in to pay for it separately. Overall, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Like Cheesecake Factory's we have here in CA, delicious!
Oddly, we didn't have to wait to get seated (3 of us), we were prepared since it's in a mall and it was during the HOT summer we were here.

Service was OK, food was good though and came out super quick."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my nieces's 17th birthday and received special treatment all around. I think it was the regular special treatment that all guests receive when they dine here, however, it made it special for her. Clarissa, our server went out of her way to ensure that our party of 10 was well taken care of, offered outstanding suggestions for appetizers, drinks and entrees, as for me this was my first time dining at The Cheesecake Factory - however will not be my last. The staff in all positions were professional, helpful and helped make this day really special. I do recommend reservations for more than 4 people to cut wait time, but they were seating customers quickly."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory, you know what to expect. If you don't, then this is for you.

You can generally expect to have a good wait time to get into a seat because the food is awesome. Do not mistake this wait time for poor service because it's generally anything besides lacking. 

At this one in particular, you can be seated on one of three floors or even out in the forum shops where you can watch the fish tanks and the robotic Atlantis show. It's in the middle of all the forum shop stores at a dead end, so you really have to want to get there to find it. It's worth every second. I stayed in Vegas for a week for a convention, ate here 5 times then, and still didn't have the same thing.

They'll start by bringing you a little bread, and all of it is worth trying out and making sure that they've got more coming for you.

The drinks that they'll offer are pretty varied, from general bar items to very specialty drinks, but sometimes the beer selection is lacking oddly enough.

Appetizers are delicious and as you can expect to find throughout the entire menu, it's all over the place. You can get a dozen kinds of pizza or chicken or a delicious pasta for that matter. 

The main event though is of course.....the cheesecakes. I try to order a different one each time that I've gone in, but I've been to different locations dozens of times, and I haven't eaten the same one twice yet. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have a family of cheesecake lovers! This review is only for the bakery at this location. 
I stop by here about 3 to 4 times a year to pick up my order of cheesecake. My dad is obsessed with their low carb cheesecake since he is a diabetic and can indulge in this type of tasty desert once in a while. I'll buy any cheesecake here but it's just so pricey. I'll still keep coming back if the birthday boy or girl sends me a request, but I wouldn't come here voluntarily."}
{"text":"This place is a true piece of Americana, for gluttons, and overindulgence.
Really? Does a lunch size portion of Mac & Cheese need to be over 3200 calories with over 100 grams of fat? Do chicken breast sandwiches need to look like the meat came from a chicken grown in Chernoble? Let's explore further, cheesecake without sugar? Makes sense for those who are diabetic. But let's really see who orders sugar free cheesecake. More than likely it's the people who devour the previously mentioned mac & cheese, then to ease that guilt, order the sugar free cheesecake, that has over 50 grams of fat because it's made with cream cheese and eggs., and served with a huge dollop of real whipped cream, which by the way contains SUGAR.             

Ok, let me be fare, once in awhile this place can be good, like once every few months. I've eaten there and I used to be a big eater, and as a lover of food I was impressed by the portions. They are so big i could take most of the meal home and eat it for lunch and dinner the next day.

It's a bit expensive, but for what you get it's worth the extra spending."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with this place!  I dine solo a lot and Helen is always attentive and knows exactly what I'm getting every time.  I love the happy hour menu.  It has my favorite appetizers at an unbeatable price!  Thank you Helen!"}
{"text":"Huge portions!!! A bit pricy but with the amount food I guess it makes some sense. Would recommend also coming early as they are usually packed and you would need to wait. They don't take reservations so that's a real pain."}
{"text":"We were in the Caesars Forum Shops, and decided to have lunch at The Cheesecake Factory since we were near by. We eat at the Cheesecake Factory in our area, and I usually have the thai lettuce wraps or a fish entree. This time I decided to try something different, so I had the Luau salad. It's grilled chicken breast with mixed greens, cucumbers, red and yellow peppers, green beans, carrots, mango and topped with crisp wontons, macadamia nuts, sesame seeds and vinaigrette. I ordered the half portion, and the salad was huge. It was a very sweet and refreshing summer salad.  We sat in the patio area, and had a nice view of Caesars' gigantic tropical fish tank and people watched in the forum shops.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night for my son's birthday..His choice. It's been a while since we've eaten at Cheesecake but I'm usually a fan. Last night, however, I had to check to make sure we weren't actually in an Applebees. The food was awful! There were 8 people in our party and not one of us finished our meal. It's like they suddenly decided to start using the lowest quality ingredients possible while also jacking up the prices ($15 for a Cobb salad that contained what seemed like old, bagged lettuce and chewy chicken??). We mentioned it to the server and she responded by saying they've made some recent menu changes and are making some of the dishes differently. I take that to mean they're trying to bolster their bottom line by buying crappy quality food and dimming the lights a little more in hopes you won't notice!  We tried to save the meal by ordering some cheesecake but even the quality of that has gone down! A tiny slice of Oreo cheesecake was mostly huge chunks of Oreos and a few dabs of cheesecake mixed in. Thought maybe they were having an off night but heard tables on either side of us complaining as well; one couple said this is the third time they've noticed the poor quality of the food and would not be returning. I have to concur. This will be my last trip to Cheesecake Factory...Can eat at Chilis for a third of the price."}
{"text":"I really love this place, I have always enjoyed coming here with friends. There's always great food and the customer service isn't bad. The drinks are pretty good as well.   Isn't loud, so nice to have conversations and catch up. The service is average, after all it's not some fancy shmancy restaurant but the food and drinks are yummy so it always makes me come back, and we can't forget about the cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"Waiting time to be seated sucks. The minimum wait is about 2 hours on a weekend for a party of 2. The more people in your party, the longer the wait. Although, the food is great. Once you have tried the food, it is all worth it. The Chicken Madeira is delicious. I recommend if you like to eat chicken. It is on a sweet side with red wine sauce serve with asparagus, mushrooms and mashed potato. The bread they serve as you seat down is very good, we even bought one to take home. The service is phenomenal. We had Ashley as our server and she was excellent. Of course, we also bought some cheesecakes to take home which we did as we were waiting for our table."}
{"text":"Words of advice for large chain restaurants:

1.  Refrain from telling a large party that ordering food and drinks at the same time 'will slow down the kitchen'

2.  Try to hire servers who can tell position one from position six - being able to count is a bonus

3.  Corollary to #1 - Telling us 'most of it will come out cold anyway' is not the way to increase your tip

Stars received are for the nice hostess who seated us and the very delicious (and large) salad I ate.  Our waiter receives no stars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice within the past year. Once for dinner and once for lunch. First off, let me say, that the decor is very nice and \"fancy\" for being a restaurant located inside the mall. With that being said, it is a nicely dim lit atmosphere compared to the lively brightly lit shopping you may have done previously, perfect for sitting down to a relaxing meal. The ambiance earned 2 stars from me. 

As for the food, I'm ambivalent. The menu is quite extensive, and as good as that may seem, I think if it were shorter, they could focus and perfect the offerings. They offer complimentary bread loaves (a sourdough and a sweeter dark loaf) with pads of butter. Hope you've got strong teeth. The sourdough especially was more than crusty. I think I tore the roof of my mouth on that sucker. 

My first meal there was in the evening. I had the Steak Diane. Medallions of tender steak in a mushroom wine sauce, served alongside mashed potatoes. While I did enjoy it for the most part, I was also aware of how calorie dense it tasted.  

The 2nd meal I had was at lunch time. I ordered the beet arugula salad with goat cheese. It tasted pretty good. I've had better at other restaurants though. The spines of the arugula were a bit on the tough side. However, I am grateful that a restaurant IN the mall offers fresh greens and vegetables as an option, if you don't want to eat heavy. (you can find it on the \"skinnylicious menu\" or in the \"small plates & snacks\" section of the menu.). We also split an order of the flatbread with sausage, ricotta and kale. I loved it. Probably my favorite thing I've had in this restaurant, and I don't even like sausage! 

Okay, now for the main event, the cheesecake! Ummm, for a $7 slice of cheesecake, I'm expecting to be impressed. Wow. (That's an unenthusiastic \"wow\" by the way). Both times I was too full, and took my cheesecake home for later. It's fluffy cheesecake, not the dense, 'resistance against your fork when you cut in for a bite' type of cheesecake that makes you aware that there's actually, ya know....cream cheese in there. If you love the whipped type cheesecake desserts, then you'll probably love it. Plus, there are so many flavor choices to choose from. 

So, to sum this up, I would visit again, if I've been shopping this mall and am weary and hungry. I would visit this restaurant if family or friends want to meet up there, but I would not single this place out as a restaurant to visit because I keep thinking about the food. 

Prices are elevated for the quality of food you'll be receiving."}
{"text":"Consistency consistancy wow what more can I say I've never had a bad meal at Cheesecake Factory I often wonder how do they do it with such a large menu the food is made quickly and fresh and always taste great."}
{"text":"Last night, I called and made reservations for today at 2pm to celebrate our son's end of middle school time. I was told to arrive at 2pm because the table would be given away at 2:10pm. Our party of four arrived at 1:45pm to learn the person who answered the phone did not record our reservation. The hostess was less than helpful and gave us a pager to wait like the other 25 parties there! Dissatisfied, I grabbed a manager who was gracious enough to rectify the situation. 

Our waitress was kind and pretty attentive. Our entree selections included shepherd's pie, shrimp scampi without tomatoes that arrived with tomatoes, kids' pizza and a Cuban sandwich. Everything tasted ok. If you do have the shrimp pasta, know that it comes with five shrimp, not many noodles and barely any \"sauce\". Oh and we did have a good appetizer, the buffalo blasts!

Known for their cheesecake selections, you can't go wrong. I have a caramel pecan turtle concoction waiting in the fridge for me now. It will make up for the beginning of our experience."}
{"text":"We have some close friends that we go out to dinner with fairly consistently.  One of our favorites is The cheesecake factory.  It is is a great place to get an early dinner at a reasonable price.   Overall portion size for this restaurant is on the large size, but, if you arrive before 5 and sit in the bar area you can still order the lunch size portion at half the dinner rate and make it to the theatre on time!   Food is always high quality and if you save room you might be able to fit in some cheesecake!  Always love this place."}
{"text":"I only have one complaint is that they are always so busy! Rightfully so when they have a huge menu that can accommodate even the pickiest eater. It's one of those places I love to go for my birthday dinner to indulge on appetizers a meal and cheesecake that I usually have to take home after being stuffed. Even their drinks are delicious. If it is too busy try snagging a seat at the bar! The bartenders are always super personable and friendly! It's a place I like to go to again and again and try something new. IT's ALWAYS GOOD!"}
{"text":"Came here on MLK day. Food was good and quick. Kudos to our server Pedro for the friendly service."}
{"text":"Giving 1 star because it won't let me give less! Arrived here Tuesday  at 430pm. 2 adults and a 5 year old. 
Our server started out friendly, then everything went downhill. She took our order, brought some bread. We had to ask 3 times to get my daughter's drink. The food came out and an expediter tried to give my daughter salmon, I told her that we ordered grilled chicken for the chilc. So she shoved the plate at me again and said, OH yes, this is the chicken.  I looked at it and said, no, it isn't,  that is salmon. You were right the first time, but it is still not what we ordered. Another person sat my steak in front of me and a dish of mashed potatoes.  They took my daughters food back to try again. My husbands food came with a 3rd person about 5 minutes later. My potatoes were cold, steak was close to the doneness that I had ordered. The server took the potatoes to get fresh. Then they returned with my daughters plate, which now had a 1x2 inch piece of grilled chicken that was about 1/4 inch thick and had clearly been cut from another piece. So we had ordered grilled chicken, broccoli and fries. She got chicken, broccoli and carrots. Veggies were ice cold. Eventually my potatoes came back hot on top and cold inside. 
Both hubby and I had ordered the ribs eyes but we're not given knives to cut it with.
Hubby's fries were cold as well. 
Server said she was sorry and would get a manager. After 10 minutes waiting on manager to come, hubby got up to find one....
Jeremy, a manager, came back to the table with him and we explained the debacle that had been our meal so far. He asked us what we wanted him to do!!!
He said he would take off the kids meal and some other things to make it right.
When the bill came, he had comped the children's meal and nothing else. 
They can forget us ever returning to this place. 
I did not expect the entire meal to be comped but good lord, this place is a mess."}
{"text":"A Vann sister favorite! The Cheesecake Factory always is a big hit with us. Today I got the Louisiana Chicken pasta and split the Fried Mac & Cheese Balls with my sister. The pasta has a nice kick to it and breading on the chicken is light and crunchy. The only downside today was I found a dark long hair in my pasta. The Mac & Cheese was fantastic as always though."}
{"text":"High variety menu! Food is tasty and dishes are huge. Difficult to eat appetizer and entree because they are too big. Farfale with chicken and mushroom is my favourite dish. Almost impossible to have a slice of cheesecake after some much food, but you have to order one to take home at least."}
{"text":"Ugh. Being a student at UNCC, I rarely venture to the South Park area. For my 21st birthday all I wanted to do was eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory. We went around 3ish so the wait was only about 5minutes. 

Being my 21st I kind of expected for the server to at least notice when I got carded and ordered drinks that it was my birthday and he didn't. The drinks were good though. My boyfriend told the server as he passed by that I was a little hurt and the climatic moment I had been waiting for was ruined and he admitted that he only checked the year. 

Overall the food was meh. I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes. They must pre plate the potatoes when you get the combinations because it turned into a molded shape in the middle. The shrimp and steak were bleh and I can't even complain that I only received 3 shrimps and 3 steak medallions because they weren't very good. Boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. He said it was alright but the menu says it comes with a plantain. They had a grilled banana on it- maybe they expect people to not know the difference? 

Cheesecake was very good though. 

I will never be visiting again. The server did the bare minimum. We left spending $115 including tip but the boyfriend was charged $121. Even though it's $6, that's sketchy. Boyfriend called the manager and the manager said to call his bank because he saw that we were charged $115 but he had to keep explaining that he was over charged. I work at a restaurant and the boyfriend has a chef for a brother so we both are familiar with the service industry and I will never eat at a place with servers bold enough to readjust tips that have a manager that could care less."}
{"text":"Found a piece of plastic ????????, a twist tie type item (see picture #130), in my mashed potatoes. I had taken about 5 bites of my food at this point, and I told my waiter. Unfortunately, both the manager and waiter were not very sympathetic or accommodating, and I didn't even get a real apology. My entree was taken off the bill, as it should have been, but the manager said they would only give me either a piece of cheesecake, or a half order of my entree, which was the Chicken Madeira. ????????????????????????????????????????????......I am a big eater, so I left the Cheesecake Factory hungry still. It was already gross that a large twist tie had been melting in my mashed potatoes the entire time they were being cooked (the manager explained it had come from the bag of potatoes), and I wish the Cheesecake Factory had done a better job of making it right. I used to come here all the time, but because of the poor customer service, I will not be coming back anytime soon.?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????........."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory, Caesar's Palace, Table of Five, including three kids who eat from adult menu. Didn't matter, same as Boca Park, Cheesecake, you get seated in the worst booth imaginable, no matter how many booths are available. Go to this Cheesecake with a couple of kids, guarantee they stick you under the staircase, no ambiance. If you complain you'll be moved to the booth next to the Bus Boy Credenza (where waiters grab for utensils.) Go ahead, bet you I'm right.  Has to be a Cheesecake policy-- both places? Listen to those forks and knives thrown into those drawers twenty, thirty at a time. Wonderful! Isn't it? 

Server (woman about 50-60's) comes over to take order. She says, and I am quoting, \"So,\" as she turns toward me, her shoulders framing me out, \"Let's start with the gentleman.\" 

I said, \"No, let's start with the ladies.\"

She was absolutely taken aback, instantly disturbed. Look on her face could kill.  

Sorry, but a gentleman always lets the ladies order first. It's not sexist. It's respect."}
{"text":"Happy hour time is the best time at the Cheesecake Factory!  I took pix of their HH menu for your eyes only  
I got their chicken rolls appetizer, my hubby got their chicken fried sliders with a side of fries.  Portions are gigantic! Flavors are a mouth full! I topped it with a Long island ice tea for just $5.95.  Our grand total was $21.  We also had a complimentary bread basket and butter with white and dark bread rolls.  Bon appetit!
Ambiance was chill, TV background, some people are on their laptops wrapping their day, pleasant staff, street view, high top tables mixed with low table lounges and couches."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of cheesecake factory. I've been going since I was a kid. It's usually consistent. This trip however was very different. Appetizer (spinach, artichoke, cheese dip) was good, my little ones grilled cheese was fine, but our chicken chipotle pasta was terrible. The flavor was fine, but the pasta wasn't even near cooked all the way. After we sent it away the manager said that their pasta machine was acting up! Why are they making pasta if the \"cooker\" is broken? Can they not make pasta in an old school pot with water? I didn't ask for anything else. We ordered a key lime cheesecake to go and went home. The cheesecake was the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"So I assumed since I had a such a bad experience about one month ago I wrote a review. However, i must not of.  Let's start with my little brother's girlfriends graduation dinner from UNLV. A party of 8, service was good, the server was attentive and had everything going for her when it came to her tables. 
The food, well, how can you mess up a burger medium? It can be done, and I was done this night.  As they were swamped, I knew better than to ask for a remake, it would have taken them one hour for a burger.  No worries the dessert made up for the crappy food. 

Now today, 6/18, as it was not my choice to go, I went back because my brother's girlfriend loves it there. Issac was our server, really good server, but the length of time to get two basic meals was not good. I did not order as I got there late, and my brother was waiting 1 hour for tacos and some other quick making food. 
The patrons to the side of us, who came in after him and right before I,  received their food beforehand. As both my brother and I come from a hospitality owned establishment, this is not what we excepted. 
This is not the normal Cheesecake Factory expectations, at least from the east coast. I know I will not be returning to this one ever again. Furthermore, I will make sure no one visits this one when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Meh.  My over all review can be reduced to \"Meh\".  The garlic noodles with shrimp had spaghetti not spaghettini, the shrimp was over over over cooked, and the asparagus was woody.  Flavor is fine.  Grey Goose dry martini is good.  Not watered down.  Server is pleasant.

Side note:  after voicing my concerns to Marissa, our waitress-who is really good- made sure to address them to my surprised satisfaction.  So, based purely on Marissa's customer service - revise my review from 2 stars to 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Food is good as always, service is awful! Just awful. We were sitting outside, our server intentionally ignored us EVERY time we call him. Didn't catch his name, never once came back ask how our meal was. Not sure if he did this because we are Asian or they just hire people with low service standard now. Will not return to this location ever in my life!!!:("}
{"text":"Three of us came for lunch. The restaurant is nicely designed with an extensive menu. I had hot potato soup with crab puff appetizer. My meal was okay but I could not find the crab in the puffs. My friends had the shrimp and linguini and fried shrimp and pasta. We also had two slices of cheesecake. The meal was quite expensive and this is a favorite for my friends. Service was good."}
{"text":"So disappointed! As regular customers to this location, we spent Thanksgiving there.. food was great but our server was horrible. Said strange things. Talked us out of certain food and then when I wanted to order 3 kids meals so I could share 2 with my 1 year old and my 8 year old would have his own he looked at me and said NO! I said I can't?? And said NO!  With that he said he would come back! So rude. I work in customer service myself and I can't imagine treating a customer like that. I order the same thing every time and never have a problem. My 1 year old doesn't eat much so really it's not like I'm being cheap. I just hate to waste food. No other server ever gives me a hard time. He could have said I'm sorry I'll have to ask a manager or something a little nicer but he treated me like a criminal. It's really not that big of a deal. He needs to find a different line of work!"}
{"text":"If you have been to one of their franchises you know what to expect. The service was good, the salads big and tasty, dessert was very nice."}
{"text":"It is a Cheesecake Factory so you know what to expect.  

-massive menu
-huge portions of food
-consistently good presentation and taste
-pricey food costs
-decadent cheesecake dessert 
-take home boxes galore
-loud / crowded / insane dining room

Not much else to say.  You either are OK with Cheesecake Factory or you aren't.   It isn't for me but I get the appeal so putting aside my personal views, it gets 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Delicious cheesecake and the food has always been great. My favorite is tiramisu cake."}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good when I go. Nothing to die for but it's pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been to this locations multiple times; however, this last visit was exceptional. When we first got to the restaurant, the wait was about five minutes. When we were finally seated, it seemed like it took a few minutes to get served. About five minutes in, our server, Cole, came by and was friendly and let us know it would be a few minutes, rather than keeping us longer. We ordered a couple drinks and ordered an appetizer. We tried ordering one appetizer, but they were out of them. However, our server recommended southwestern egg rolls which were delicious! The Cheesecake Factory always has great food, but this particular experience was so great because of the server. I don't think my drink ever had a chance to get empty. We ordered our food, but the entire time, our server was SO attentive and interactive with us. We will definitely be back. Good job on hiring Cole, EXCELLENT server."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. I always get the Santa Fe salad or the bang bang chicken. Yum! The cheesecakes are always a good plus- if I'm not that hungry!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our visit here was far from superior. We were seated ( 3 of us) at a table and were not acknowledged by our server , no water or bread.  We were glancing at our menus and other tables were then seated and approached by our server.   We did not recieve any service until 15/20 mins.   We had ordered our food and waited another 30 mins and proceeded to speak with a manager. The manager then switched our server to prevent any more mis communication.  Our food came and one of our dishes did not arrive (5-10mins later).  The dressing for one of our salads also did not arrive.  We were then presented with our new server whom took care of us. The manager did not seem very sympathic to us as she was just doing what she thought was good and did not go above and beyond.   Unfortunately our experience was not the greatest although the other times we have gone we have had amazing experiences."}
{"text":"Well, for starters: we were told we would be seated in 15-20 minutes. 25 minutes later we confront the hostess who goes \"Well, we said 15-20 minutes, and it's only been 25.\" Um, ok. Anyways, another 15 minutes after that (40 minutes in total) we get seated. 

The waitress was nice and processed our orders quickly and efficiently. HOWEVER! The food was meh, to say the least. The bread was good as usual, but everything else was bland. I got the Renee's Special, which is a soup/sandwich/salad combo. I try to eat relatively healthy (lots of protein, no additives) so restaurant food is usually a flavor overload. Nope! The tortilla soup tasted like lukewarm salty water. My sandwich was OK tasting but the bread was so hard I had to break away the top layer to even bite through it! For 11 bucks I can get a better combo at Subway. I'm disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Great service  despite 20 minute wait for  a table on an early Sunday evening. Server recommended Cobb salad, which turned out to be awesome, large and filling, Unfortunately no space left for cheesecake :("}
{"text":"This was probably the second worst service I've ever receive at a restaurant, you know when you get bad service when the moment you seat down and when you get your drinks. Took total 10 mins to get our water and then from that moment on just the guy kept forgetting about us. Other ppl had to serve us. I lost my appetite when I got my food when I had to wait for it when my other 2 guest got theirs."}
{"text":"Another disappointing visit to Cheesecake Factory. Based on last night's dinner I think I am done with them.
We arrived shortly after 6 and were seated in the front area of the restaurant, through the bar. The lighting was ridiculous..SO dark. I couldn't even see the booth or menu and saw other tables using their cell phone light to look at the menu. When did the lighting change?
Our waitress was such a disappointment, first forgot the lemon for the water, forgot bread, after two requests, and then brought out of one wrong meal.
The wine selection isn't that great and the wine we both ordered was horrible.
As for the entrees, again, the crab cakes were blah. My friend got the Chicken Romano and was a pile of spaghetti with breaded chicken, which I found very bland.
After attempting to order another drink, not another glass of wine, I never received it. Finally asked for the bill, which reflected that second drink. 
The worst part about it, $70 for two drinks and two entrees. Isn't this the Cheesecake Factory? Sorry, I have no issue paying $70 when the food and service reflect the price but Cheesecake Factory isn't that place.
I will not return."}
{"text":"The usually say second times a charm I think.. or is that the third time. Oh well, in this case sadly it wasn't. Came here on a Wednesday evening, and wow it was packed! My boyfriend and I had to wait forever, literally. We waited about 3 hours or even a bit more. 

Despite waiting for such a long time, our waitress was kind and attentive. She provided us with everything we needed, and checked up on us to see if everything was okay. 

The food.. hmm, both pasta dishes we ordered needed A LOT more flavour, it was bland. Out of the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and the Pasta Napoletana, the Pasta Napoletana was much better. The cheesecake on the other hand, was amazing! We got the red velvet cheesecake and the oreo dream extreme cheesecake for take-out. 

Once we received our bill, we realized that we were charged for wine and soda, however we did not order those. However, once we told our waitress, she removed the soda and gave us a new bill which STILL included the wine. It was kind of funny at first, but then it just took a while to leave from there. At the end, she ended up removing both of them and apologized. So make sure you double check your bill! 

All in all, I prefer the Buffalo location over the Toronto location. If I were to come back, I'd come back for the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Well! Went to the Cheesecake Factory for my Birthday. As always I have the Chicken Marsala (always is the greatest). Not yesterday. Got one piece of chicken about 2\" by 4\" and about a pound or more of bow ties. It use to be 3 small pieces of chicken and a nice medium order of bow ties. I was always able to eat the whole meal but yesterday I could not even come close to finishing the bow ties. The chicken went down in 3 fork 
full. $20.00 Terrible! Wake up!"}
{"text":"You'd think that clean eating and the Cheesecake Factory would not compute, but you can find clean eats most anywhere, even here at this chain restaurant.  Yes, it's a bummer not to indulge in their red velvet cheesecake at the end of the meal, but you don't always have to eat cheesecake just because it's the name of the place.  The Skinnylicious menu has many items to choose from that can be made even cleaner.  I'm a big fan of the turkey burger, ordering it protein-style (without the bread), hold the mayo.  The side salad it comes with is good with its balsamic vinaigrette dressing, too.  The b/f and I had lunch there today and he had grilled chicken breast with brown rice and broccoli, also very clean.  I'm a fan of being able to order our meals the way we want to here with no fuss from the staff.  Major kudos and it keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"The service here is mediocre. Maybe because I'm from Los Angeles this does not compare the the Cheesecake factory is California, the food is meh! I asked for a side of sun dried tomato and the server has no idea what I was talking about... Omg the pasta was so bland I couldn't believe this was the Cheesecake Factory.  It's pale in comparison to US location."}
{"text":"I have found the food and service at this Cheesecake Factory to be consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. I have done dine-in and takeout at this location, and have not had any issues.

Personally, my three favorite entrées are the Grilled Pork Chops, Beef Ribs, and Miso Salmon. Buffalo Blasts are my favorite of the appetizers.

Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"That chicken and shrimp pasted  taste super bad, I don't know why so many people Oder that paster , super bad:(,  we waited for 40 minutes for the food, and there are many noodles inside and all the stuff no flavor ! No flavor! No flavor!  Never want to eat here !"}
{"text":"So great, great food, great service and Jesse nailed it...  thanks for making a special day more special"}
{"text":"The food was good nothing spectacular, typical for the cheesecake factory, and of course the cheesecake was wonderful. Our server on the other hand, we kept saying \"maybe she's new\" to give her the benefit of the doubt, but really you drop the check without dropping off the desserts... It was a slow Monday night there shouldn't of been that long of a wait for food nor to check out, we just needed her to be a little more attentive."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. This is your run of the mill Cheesecake Factory, but the service is subpar compared to other Cheesecake factories."}
{"text":"Since they aren't the cheapest I don't go too often but when I do I always get great service and the food is excellent. I think this is the only restaurant I've been to and have not had an issue with the service."}
{"text":"Tonight has been the worst service ever. Our waitress was rude and very disrespectful. Manager was rude and disoriented. The food was cold, bland, took over an hour as the messed up our order. Been here several times before with no issues. This place has gone way down hill!"}
{"text":"I always order the same thing every time I Coke here. The mushroom burger. I should really try something new, but why when it's just too good?! I love this place. Very roomy and the serves are great. The best time to come to The Cheesecake Factory is Sunday around 10. The wait isn't long and you are always guaranteed fresh food!"}
{"text":"Good food, but it's a little pricey.  If you can afford it or go during happy hour, you'll be all right."}
{"text":"Man... the cheesecake factory. I loved this place when I was like 8 years old and they were only located in california. Now, it is just a strange experience. It's strange because people line up to come here and wait an hour sometimes.... for what? The food is mediocre at best and it's incredibly overpriced. Anyway, my brother had given me a gift card to this restaurant for chrisanuka. So I finally got around to using it last night. I was in class until 8 and needed to go someplace that was open late (and since we had the gift card, this was the place). The first thing I really hate about this restaurant is the menu size. It is totally unnecessary and every time I go here I just sit and stare at the menu for ever before figuring out what I want. And it's not because it is all too good, It is trying to figure what type of food do I want, what isn't going to be incredibly ridiculously unhealthy, and what isn't 15$ because that is just too much to be spending on a mediocre meal in a chain restaurant. I could go to a pretty good local restaurant and pay the same. Also, with such a big menu I wonder how much of it could possibly be fresh... everything on their menu can't be ordered everyday...? I don't know. So last night I finally decided on the Saigon chicken sandwich with a side salad and the BF got the club. Both were fine, at least with the sandwiches the portion size isn't quite so crazy. 

Kind of on a side note, our waitress last night was really strange. I think she was putting on an accent and she kept including herself in her questions ie Would we like some pepper on our salad? (um I don't know, would you, creepy waitress lady?) Also, I don't know if the restaurant changed, or what, but she spouted off a 5 minute speech when we got there about the menu (and on page 5 you will find this item, and on page 7, this item).... that was really strange. I have the menu right in front of me.... it is large, so maybe I need direction around it, but generally I can read.

So anyway, for two sandwiches, no drinks, we paid 27$. That is insane. But we had the gift card, so it turned out alright.... but seriously... why do people eat here? I do not understand it! What is the appeal!!!?!?!?!?!


Ok sorry for the rant."}
{"text":"Went here on National Cheesecake day and had a good meal. My calamari wasn't chewy, it was perfect! But it did come with some strange dipping sauces...The green tea I had was awesome, and my dining partner for the evening enjoyed their meal as well. The cheesecake was a little too sweet for my taste, but it was only 1.50, so I had no right to even complain. 

I then came back to this same restaurant on Friday and only had a Mojito and a little bit of salad and some of the jambalaya pasta dish. All where extremely yummy, and the wait staff wasted no time clearing off our table after we got up. I lost my Fat Tuesday cup here [sheds a tear]. But hey, at least they're keen and quick on the cleaning. I can't remember the courtesy of the wait staff but I'm sure they were nice, otherwise I would have noticed it. Oh! And the restrooms were upstairs, I wasn't much of a fan of that, stairs and being tipsy don't mix, take the elevator!"}
{"text":"I was grudgingly here for lunch today, because I was invited by my mom and others and had no choice in the matter really. Although prices have gone through the roof, yes even for lunch, I believe this establishment is still above standards, even for a chain restaurant. 

Our waitress was on top of her 'waiting-game', I was not disappointed with her or her service, kudos! Nor was I with the food. I had a Factory Salad, minus the chicken, bacon and the vinaigrette with bacon in it. It was refreshing and I loved the chunks of avocado hidden in the depths of my mountainous salad. 

I believe this was the first time I sat on the patio at this location, which was not bad, considering the heat of midday. It was very shady and cool. I don't doubt that inside the restaurant was much cooler. Overall experience, pretty decent, I'm not complaining, I'm full and content. And yes, I left without cheesecake in or on me, so it was a good day, dairy is hating me more and more with age..."}
{"text":"I have been to CF a number of times but I haven't been back in a while and I felt the need to write a review for my most recent visit. I had the pleasure of taking my entire family (wife and 5 children - 14, 10, 10, 7, 5) plus a 6 yo friend of my 7 yo daughter to eat at CF for my 7 year old's birthday dinner. I realize it was 7pm on a Wed night (not a weekend night), but it was still busy. So - it was crazy, to say the least - loud, annoying, yelling, constant battles between the boys, unnecessary comments and touching, eye rolls and sighs...you know the drill.

But CF and my server were FANTASTIC and handled it all with serious grace and professionalism. 

Look - the food at CF is good. Very good. Yes, the Factory Burrito is flippin huge and enough for an entire village to eat. Yes, their cheesecakes are absurdly large and delish. Yes, their menu is a bit overpriced, especially some of the kids' meals. But it is truly hard to complain due to the quality of the food.

But my issues with CF in the past have almost entirely been about service. Not THIS time, however. 

I got there early to get a table (b/c they still have that stupid \"no reservation\" rule, ugh). The Hostess was very nice and went out of her way to help, even making sure my name stayed at the top of the list while I waited for my family to arrive (2 cars). We were settled into a large, round booth-thing. ONE SERIOUS ISSUE - the booth's seat fabric was TERRIBLE. It was literally missing in multiple places with stuffing popping out. Unreal. It wasn't uncomfortable or anything, just VERY ugly and not what I expect for Southpark and the prices they charge.

Anyway - our server was amazing. She was constantly there, getting constant refills for my camel-like kids, never getting upset about all the yelling and things being spilled. She got our food out ASAP and was always (somehow) happy to help us with the (stupidest) requests from my children (including needing crayons to color - which she somehow found - and paper). I honestly cannot say enough about her and the rest of the staff there. THANK YOU - it was so nice to be treated with such courtesy and respect even when busy in a huge restaurant with \"difficult\" patrons."}
{"text":"Decided to come to Cheesecake Factory with the family to celebrate my bday. It was busy so I get why the hostess forgot to give us a pager. Fortunately we were able to be seated within 20 min after checking in twice to make sure we weren't called. I'm grateful they turned down the music cause I couldnt hear my family speaking. We ordered egg roll and calamari and the sauce was amazing with it. We ordered fettuccini, kids pizza, pork chop and veggie burger. All of which was just okay. Fettuccini was bland. Pizza did not have enough sauce, pork chop was overpowered by the Apple sauce. Veggie burger was different from last time where it consisted of beets while this time it was beans and brown rice. The server was under the weather and very curt but still friendly. Over all it was okay. Not a place I would go often but maybe once or twice year."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory and not because they have yummy cheesecakes.  They have a huge selection of things to eat from all day breakfast to yummy sandwiches.  

I love their nachos, and the banana cream pie cheesecake.  I think they need more locations cus the lineups are insane!

Also our server Darren was super nice and attentive.  He made our experience at the Cheesecake Factory a lot better!"}
{"text":"I usually get to go orders, but this place is always packed when I go to pickup my food.  Expect a wait during dinner time on Fri/Sat/Sun.  Food is great, staff is friendly.  For how big the menu is.. I'd like to see more variations on the specific menu items and improvement to the online ordering system.  This is a chain restaurant, but I've never had better mozzarella sticks or \"fried cheese\" anywhere.  It's either made in house or bought from a really good source."}
{"text":"This is considered the North Las Vegas location. Best service from Gary P. We went to this location instead of on the Strip to avoid the wait times. Our party of 7 was seated immediately on a Thursday night without any wait. Its located on the north end of a new Outlet mall off Bonneville. There is a parking structure right across from the restaurant. Our server Gary P. was the best! He assisted everyone (including the kids) with a friendly and easygoing manner to order exactly what they wanted. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (veg) with chicken even though that wasn't an option on the menu. Gary came over many times to make sure our drinks were filled and brought us extra bread. Everything was cooked perfectly and the wait time for the food was not long. I also ordered the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake to go and everyone enjoyed a bite at the hotel. Best service I've ever had at any Cheesecake factory!
Will definitely go again when next in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. The food is outstanding and the drinks are perfect every time. I was surprised with this place especially in a outdoor mall, but I am glad I went."}
{"text":"This is an ultimate failure for a cheesecake factory. 
When we arrive we didn't have to wait long, so that was pleasant.  Once they called my name to seat us knowing full well we have a small child and need a menu for him they didn't bring one. 

They station us in a back area from the main dinning area. I didn't care so much about that, we did have to walk outside to go back inside to be seated.  
Once we are seated and given our menus I realize we didn't get a kids menu and I asked for one.  The hostess never brought us one so we ended up having to ask the waitress what was available for children. This was after we had already sat at the table 15 minutes before we were even greeted by our waitress; who was overwhelmed.   

We figure out what my son wants, we order drinks and food. We are asked if we want bread and we say yes. Then our waitress was off, we order water, sprite and a mojito.  We get our water and sprite about five minutes later and about fifteen minutes after that they bring my food and my husbands. I set timer and they bring my sons plate out, over five minutes later.  

When I was done with my meal they finally bring my mojito (mind you, after I ordered it I said I'd walk back over and get it because it is pretty far from our seating area). They never did bring us bread and we never did see out waitress again because someone else brought our meals and drinks. 

After we were done eating it took another fifteen minutes to get our check. 

This was the most awful experience ever.  Poor time management and multitasking.  I think the manager needs some updated training.  He/she is way over their heads.  
Our food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I love Cheesecake Factory; although expensive the atmosphere is cheerful.  

The service is always awesome when we go to any of these establishments.  

Today we met some friends for lunch. When we arrived and walked in I let them know we had a party of six and I asked the girl If there was a wait and she said \"no there isn't a wait\" I said great. She takes my name and says it will be about five minutes. I was like what, you just said there wasn't a wait?????? I wasn't upset that there was gonna be a wait but for the fact she said there wasn't going to be one was kind of annoying.  I thought okay maybe they have to get a table to fit us. That wasn't the issue because after waiting about ten minutes they walked us over to a booth which was sitting next to a handful of other empty booths.  Again I wasn't mad about waiting but just annoying that she lied, bizarre right??

Anyway, the host gives us our menus and about five minutes goes by before our super,  sweet and nice waitress arrives to get our drink orders. She goes to retrieve our drinks, drops them off and I realize we don't have straws for our drinks; only a straw for my sons (which they put in). I actually prefer to do this ourselves. Again just annoying.  We wait for about five minutes before anyone walks by before we scored straws.  

Next, we finally get our food orders in and our meals finally arrived about 25 minutes; after giving our orders.  

The food was good and I do like that they have added the calories of their meals to menus,  as well as new items. 

When it was time to pay getting our bill took forever; once she dropped the bills off it took another ten minutes before she came back to retrieve them. It was annoying again.  

My last complaint was that the booth was filthy. There was dust on one of the napkins, corn dog sticks between the wall and seat as well as on the on the floor. There were crumbs all over the seats and the floors were dirty. The place really needs a deep clean. If the dining area is filthy that makes me assume that the kitchen must be pretty dirty. 

I can promise you this; I'm finding a different Cheesecake Factory to eat at and never visit this establishment again"}
{"text":"One Saturday I sat at the bar for lunch. There was no wait to sit there (or in the dining room for that matter) and as soon as we sat down the bartender approached and welcomed us. 

We ordered our food and afterwards the bartender specifically asked us if we wanted bread. We said yes...but bread never came. 

We ordered the appetizer Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos and chose the Asian style. The lettuce leaves were large enough to hold all the fillings successfully. They were filled with grilled chicken and then you could pick one of two types of flavors. We chose Asian which included carrots, bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro and rice noodles. One spicy cashew and one sweet cilantro sauce came with it. These were good. 

For my main I ordered the lunch portion of the Shepherd's Pie. I'm not opposed to non traditional SPs, I love them in fact, but this one wasn't good. Mashed potatoes were placed on top, but not covering the entire top and not baked on. Peas, carrots, zucchini and onions were mixed in the mushroom gravy below the potatoes. The mushroom gravy flavor was noticeable. This was all good. 

The meat however, was not ground beef as the menu description simply indicated. The meat was a broken apart flame-grilled hamburger. I could clearly taste the flame grilled aspect of the meat. The meat was also not in crumbles, but was in chunks as if literally a hamburger had been grilled and ripped apart. Between the flavor and the texture of the meat the dish was ruined."}
{"text":"This time around, at this location, my Cheesecake experience was surprisingly good, impressively so at times. 

The waitress we had was really on top of her game. She was always friendly and checked back at the table at all the right times. She filled drinks right away and even brought my friend fresh limes each time she topped up his drink without him asking for it. 

For an appetizer we got the Avocado Eggrolls. They were delicious and I loved dipping them in the Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. The breading was light and they were packed full of avocado. There was of course the good warm bread and the waitress proactively offered to replenish it.  

I tried the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas. The Tomatillo Sauce on top of them was quite flavorful. The portion was appropriate. 

My friend got the Luau Salad. The chicken was thinly sliced. The special dressing was a great compliment - very fresh and light. The kitchen did forget the chicken initially, but our waitress was able to quickly rectify the situation. 

Another friend ordered the Chicken Bellagio. The chicken was lightly breaded and the cream sauce was light and not overwhelming. The portion was big as the two chicken pieces are served on top pasta. 

I would order any of these dishes next time and based on this experience, especially the service, I would consider returning again soon."}
{"text":"I always love coming here to eat but when you get a server like Adrian Vera your experience is truly enhanced. This man is the definition of gentleman and made my family's Mother's Day better than I could imagine. Ask for him and I'm certain you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place it had one of the best steaks I've had in a while and my wife absolutely love her cheesecake and the service was great love this place!"}
{"text":"The $12 ahi carpaccio is delicious. No for real, order two plates. It's that good.

That said, this place is so ridiculously packed all the time. Huge waits just to get a table - you're better off going off of the Strip, plus you won't have to pay for the entertainment tax on your bill. 

The place is NOISY (as are all Cheesecake Factories) so sit up top if you can. The service is decent, but that's to be expected."}
{"text":"After a 50 mins wait time we got a ridiculously small table for our group of five. The Lady who escorted us to the table was straight-forwardly arrogant forcing us to make a choice either to take the table or wait for more (ironic smile)... Amanda, our server saved the whole impression, she did great, but I'll never return here nor recommend anyone to come. This is truly a Factory - and guests are treated like products..."}
{"text":"tried two dishes for take out, portions are for 2-3 persons easily. food was quite tasty, specially their meat loaf. husband wasn't in love with it but I was. I haven't tried cheesecake yet because it really seems to be expensive and over the top calorie wise but I eventually will for sure. lineups/wait is way too long to eat in and I would have to take half home anyway. will return eventually, one dish for two of us to eat at home is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Love coming here for dinner. When we first walked in the wait was 15 minutes. Went to the bar and had a drink while we waited. Had a margarita which was good. For dinner we ordered the chicken enchiladas which you can never go wrong with... And my fiancé had a vegan salad. Food came out with no delay and the server was very attentive. If you can't decide what to eat for lunch or dinner this is the place to go with plenty of variety of foods and drinks to choose from!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, even for it being at the Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was very attentive, personable and knowledgable about their menu. 

This location is clean, very nice lighting that sets the mood for all types of dining occasions. 

The menu is stellar as always with generous portions(even on the lunch menu). They are always adequately staffed and the wait times, even in the peak of summer was less than 20 minutes. 

Wonderful representation of the Cheesecake Factory name."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory is great for their extensive menu and delicious cheesecakes. I rated a 4 star because it's difficult for me to ever give a chain restaurant a 5 star strictly because I like authenticity. On the expensive side, the food and cocktails are delicious. 

I do really appreciate that they do NOT use Styrofoam for their to-go boxes."}
{"text":"Great building and scenery!  I love the inside but the lighting is really dim. My girlfriend and I both ordered pasta and it was delicious. Our server was very nice but a little too nice. She acted fake a lot of the time. Moving forward I also got the Oreo cheesecake it was so tasty! I recommend coming here!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time being at the cheesecake factory, and we went for my Sister's birthday, and we had a party of 8. (5/27).  So...it all started with the simplicity of drinks. My husband and I got there to reserve the table for our party. Jennifer came, asked us what we wanted, and she walked back and forth in the opposite direction of where the soda machine was at. Another nice gentlemen came to make sure that we were already taken care of, and thinking back we should've switched waiters while we had the chance. Any who, our drinks our finally brought, and we still havent gotten our bread and butter (as promised by Jennifer). So there goes another 15 minutes to get us the bread. My family gets here, and we are all deciding what to eat. Mind you, ive never been there so im having trouble trying to choose an entree. I ask Jennifer what she recommends and she said \"im classy so i like so and so plate\"...like what? Am i too ghetto for you, Jennifer?  so, i order this chipotle pasta thing and when i got it, it was alright. I ate it because i was really hungry but it wasnt the best thing. My niece is telling this waitress that it's my sister's birthday, us expecting for them to sing to her you know, because it's tradition. Nope, Jennifer just looked at her like she was crazy and walked away, didnt even say happy birthday at the most. Fast forwarding to the check, obviously we are all split. So, i personally got the check and split it into number groups. Group 1 was me and my husband, 2 was my sister and her family, so on and so forth. She sees me doing this, and says \"oh awesome thanks for splitting it for me!\" She comes back and says \"so i know you tried helping me but i found an easier way\". Like ok, whatever works for you, Jennifer. She gives us back our checks and they're all messed up............but she found an easier way right? . She claimed that the system was messing up but the table to our right was clearing up and had new families sitting there to have dinner. Bad bad bad. Don't recommend Jennifer at all."}
{"text":"After about a 20 minute wait I'll start with the positive.  The kids meal is terrific.  Lots of variety as opposed to typical low end Mac n cheese corn dog kids menus.   Yes they had that but my kids got a terrific pizza, grilled salmon with tender carrots and mashed potatoes.  We also got chicken strips (real meat) with two sauces and nice mixed berry and pineapple. At the end we ordered strawberry cheesecake.  Terrific and plenty of whipped cream for the kids.  
Ok so adults:   We got the jambalaya, which was decent but not real flavorful and we'd never get it again.  We also ordered French onion soup.  It looked like they opened a can of Campbell's and dumped it in a bowl with croutons and shredded cheeses.  Our server was Elizabeth.  She had other people deliver the food and did not check on us during our meal, in which I decided to forego my soup.  We hailed her 3-4 times with busboys and other waitstaff asking for utensils, straws, and water (you know basic items that should be on a table).   We started busing our plates by stacking them and after asking a busboy for water, he disappeared for 5 minutes and then Elizabeth showed up.  I asked her to return the soup.  She said no problem.  This was her standard response to any request, which I thought was odd because I didn't consider our requests to be problems in the first place, so I didn't need reassurance that it wasn't a problem.  At one point a young man who looked like a manager walked by and stood next to me.  He was very concerned about a 16 top that was getting set up.  Although I yelled excuse me three times at him, he ignored me and walked away.  

I wanted to ask him why the waitress would simply take away my rejected soup without asking what was wrong with it or offering another option.  SOP

So back to Elizabeth. She very enthusiastically asked us if we'd like the cheesecake menu.  We ended with the slice of cheesecake.  Walking out I searched for a manager again but he was nowhere to be found.  I imagine I was the tipping point for him most likely having heard multiple complaints that night and he escaped.  

So like I said avoid this place for just about anything. Unless you simply want a quick cheesecake fix. 


Thank you guest services for the reply. I appreciate your concern"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. If I could give them 0 or negative stars I would. We came on Valentine's, and yes I know it's one of the busiest days, but we waited in line like everyone else. Apparently Hilary, who took our name down, did not tag our pager to our name so we sat next to the restaurant waiting for it to go off approximately 45 minutes past the expected wait time. She stated that they called our name but we were listening intently, as we knew they were very busy, but never heard our name called once. When we went up to talk to her she said she would \"fix\" it by putting us next in line. However, as expected the next couple who got seated arrived after us. Once we finally got seated, the man who seated us asked us about our night, so I responded with that we were fine but frustrated about what had happened. His response was \"its excepted and it happens.\" I'm not in customer service but any one with an sort of intelligence would know not to respond like that. The food was average. DO NOT EVER COME HERE EXPECTING CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ANY KIND."}
{"text":"I've been here like maybe 5 times and I still love this place. They have a wide variety of food. It's a very nice place. The only bad thing is sometimes the wait because this place always has people. Of course it's mostly on like Friday and weekends that the wait is longer but I still love this place. It actually may be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"ONLY GIVING ONE STAR BC THE FOOD TASTED FINE. 

The curbside to go service is a complete joke. I had problems last time with them forgetting half my order. I figured it was a fluke mistake and thought I'd try the curbside pick up again. I placed my order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 15 mins. Great! 

I go to pick it up, park in the designated curbside pick up parking spot, and call to let them know I was outside waiting. I WAITED 18 MINUTES!! They never brought out my food. My husband, growing more and more impatient, went inside to pick it up. They asked for the name of our order and when he told them, they were like \"oops you're orders been on the counter this whole time.\" How professional. Apparently the workers here can't do there job. Won't be back."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??!

Without a doubt, the many cheesecake options available! They're all good!! Each other's a different flavor and combination of cake or other ingredients, the cheesecake texture remains the same - very smooth soft cheese. 

I had cheesecake factory's famous jambalaya too but it did not taste great at all. The pasta was fresh but it tasted overcooked and was clumpy. The sauce and jambalaya mixture of chicken and shrimp were good but I thought with the overcooked pasta, the dish didn't taste great. 

I accepted the order but next time, I would have to return it. Cheesecake Factory has a very good satisfaction guarantee policy so if you're not happy with your meal, they will give you a complimentary dish/meal. 

LAST TIP?!

If you don't want to wait in line and you want to dine in, try sitting at the bar instead. You'll get served food and you don't have to wait in line!! It's a first come first serve basis!"}
{"text":"So this place gets a bad rap for being unhealthy. To be fair, they have a menu that could be mistaken for a small book, and it is filled with unhealthy delicious options. My friends all loved their unhealthy food and I looked longingly at them as I ate my salad.

And there is our headline. There is an ENTIRE MENU of healthy options, and I mean seriously healthy. Kale is involved, and when Kale shows up, you know healthy is about to throw down. The options included a lot of sandwiches, which didn't work for my carb-averse diet, so I requested the most obnoxious thing on the planet: a lettuce-wrapped sandwich with a side salad.

They served it, and it was what health nuts would describe as \"delicious\". I am working my way there, so as of now I can affirm that it was \"food\". Still, I was impressed with their response to the bad rap, and the many options on their healthy \"Skinnylicious\" menu. You can have very green meals here."}
{"text":"We visited on a busy Saturday night and waited awhile as expected to get seated. I decided to treat my Niece for her birthday and we came here only for the cheesecake -her favorite. We mentioned to the very nice and patient waitress the occasion. I encourage my nieces ages 10 & 4 to order for themselves -I think it helps further down the road etc. and soon enough they brought out a huge piece of chocolate cake for the little one and a huge piece of s'mores cheesecake for my older niece. Since it was my nieces birthday the waitress and another waiter sang happy birthday. Both cakes were excellent and tasted excellent. Needless to say we all got cake fatigued and took boxes home. I plan on making it her birthday tradition to come here. 
Everything was awesome except the prices but it was worth it and a nice little treat."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful on a recent busy Sat. We went a little before lunch and brunch on a Sun. It was the best crab cake I have had in a very long. Superb!"}
{"text":"had the new Thai Noodle Salad today at lunch time. Best $10 salad I've had. Lots of flavor & very good portion. My soda was free for some reason. I sat at the bar."}
{"text":"We waited about 10 min befoe getting seated, it was very busy. The service was prompt and friendly the food tasty and hot. Going back next time we are in town for sure."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Cheesecake Factory since I knew it was the restaurant where Penny work in the Big Bang theory show, and finally I made it. 
And thanks to recommendations given by yelpers, the mango key lime cheesecake didn't let me down. I love every food with mango in it. Even though I was told the cake here are too sweet for low sweet threshold Chinese people, this one I tried is bearable. 
My friend ordered the toasted pear and blue cheese flat bread which looks like a mini pizza. The flavor of blue cheese was not that sharp and salty as I imagined, probably neutralized by sweet pears. The distinct flavors getting together is unique, and it really deserves a try. 
Also I tried their salads, nothing special other than the beets, I love their purple color and the light sweet flavor."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight with family there were eight of us and on a Sunday night I knew there'd be a little wait, they were busy so the hostess gave us a pager and told us they'd have a table in 20 minutes. We waited, 20 minutes came and gone then it was 30 and 40 by this time my kids 7,6, and 16 months were growing tired, hangry and bored. It was a full hour of waiting and asking twice about our table. We were seeing people who walked in when we did and even after leaving having finished their dinner Very Disappointing! We get to our table and sit the silverware felt grainy almost dirty they took a while to take our order and even let ne'er to get it a whole hour to be exact. By this time the restaurant wasn't busy at all so no excuses. All the food came out except my sons pizza which we had to ask for after it seemed like she was busy attending another table. Food was okay except my meatloaf had aluminum foil still on it!! I told the server she takes it to her boss then she offers me another their meal which is nice but I'm not about to sit there another hour to get it. My daughters pasta was tasteless. I don't get it we go through the one at Caesars palace all the time and Never Ever had a problem there. I'm sorry to say I won't be back to this location. This wasn't the first complaint from here which made it easier for me not to come back."}
{"text":"Food is always consistant and I usually have a great service from the actually server however noticed the manager screaming at an employee in front of everyone and then  the manager chose to stand and do nothing and I so wanted to say something to the manager for being a jerk.  Otherwise my cheesecake was fabulous as normal :)"}
{"text":"Visited late afternoon on 2/11/17.  Had to wait over 1/2 hour for table. Others that came in  behind us were told 50-80 min waits. Wowza. 
Once seated, initial beverage service was prompt. I would add that although polite and serving a large table, attention to detail needs to be improved as although I was specific that I would like a glass of water without lemon, you guessed it, it came with lemon. I passed my citrus wedge on to another glass and moved on. Taking orders seemed to take longer than expected - prob took 20 mins just to put out order in. 
Food came out promptly. Quality was good, portions were large. We anticipated this and several at the table ordered to share. This worked  in our favor as all left without feeling overstuffed. Only 2 of the meals needed a doggy bag. 
Overall the experience was probably as expected. Long wait, marginal service and oversized portions. A slice of cheese cake for $7.50/slice seems very much like a money grab. Good but not worthy of that price."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I came in at a bad time... I came in for lunch with my friend and it was certainly busy. When we were seated our waitress was very friendly at first. She was very attentive (which she should be considering how expensive this restaurant is). I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and when it came out it looked delicious. It tasted absolutely HORRIBLE... It was loaded down with garlic and it ended up making me throw-up sick. I called the manager over and he didn't offer to take it off the check or anything. I told him to just bring me a burger to go. The waitress came back out about 30 minutes later with the burger and it wasn't in a to-go box. I had to ask her to bring me a box for it and she had an attitude. I said thank you and was continuously polite throughout my visit and she never said \"you're welcome\" or anything very polite back. Whenever I said \"thank you\" she just turned away. She wasn't horribly rude, but I definitely expect more for such an expensive restaurant. After we left, about 30 minutes later I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. I won' be coming back... This restaurant is not at all what it is talked up to be!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Settebello recently and nothing on their dessert menu interested us. So we decided to walk over to Cheesecake factor to share some cheesecake.

It was a Saturday night and the place was jammin. Although, it seemed as if maybe they were short staffed, because at least 1/2 the restaurant was empty, but we had to wait to be seated (along with 3 or 4 other parties in front of us).

Once we were seated, it took between 10-15 minutes for our server to approach the table. This wasn't a big deal, because we had already eaten and it gave us time to decide on what slices to order. But if I were hungry, I would have become hangry real quick.

We decided to order 3 slices (all cheesecake): Banana cream, key lime and Kahlua Cocoa.  Our server returned a short while later and let us know that they were out of the banana cream and key lime, which were the 2 we really were excited to try.  We were pretty disappointed and I wish he would've known this when we ordered originally.

We then decided on the mango key lime and lemon meringue instead.

Now, it has been quite a long time (at least a few years) since I have been to Cheesecake Factory. They have a very large menu, and not many places can pull that off. However, the service was painstakingly slow.  We shouldn't be there more than an hour when we just ordered coffee/water and dessert. Although our service was very nice, I just didn't expect to be there as long as we were.

It probably took 20-30 minutes just to get our order.  I mean, come on! For 3 slices of cheesecake, which is obviously pre-made? A bit ridiculous.

Everything was really tasty, even if it was basically not what we originally wanted. We each had a different favorite - I actually quite liked the lemon meringue, which is not what I thought my favorite would be. The Kahlua Cocoa was really rich, but good as well. The mango key lime was probably my least favorite - I thought the mango over powered the key lime, but it wasn't bad by any means.

The prices were reasonable. Our check was $28 for the slices and drinks (1 coffee). Overall, I remembered why I hadn't been in so long, since there are SO many other options in the area. But I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went to this location to dine with colleagues on Tuesday 6/12/18 at 6PM after a long day's work.  My party arrived before I did so when I got there, I told the hostess Elizabeth that I am here to meet my party and before I could even finish saying the name she said \"Party for Keisha?\" I said no, informed her of my party's name again and proceeded to our table.  Anyone mildly aware understands that what took place that day is a very dangerous form of racism called microaggression.  In this case, Elizabeth's microaggression took the form of assuming that any black person that walks in MUST be with the black people that are already in the place. She shares the same mentality as the Alabama Victoria's Secret store owner that kicked out every black person in sight because of a private issue with one person. The mental effect is the same.  I informed the manager of the incident at the end of my meal and he was less than empathetic, never apologized, and never gave me the assurance that he acknowledged the gravity of Elizabeth's err.  My meal and server were great but the negative experience with Elizabeth and the manager overshadowed the entire experience warranting one star."}
{"text":"When going to this restaurant location specifically I recommend parking in the paid parking lot across from the entrance. It will give you a little yellow token that you can validate when you are leaving and will save you the hassle of trying to find a spot in this busy location. 

Now for the restaurant! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to and the only Cheesecake Factory location I really like. The atmosphere is very lively sometimes noisy and most workers are very friendly and helpful. The lighting is rather dim in certain seating locations. I would say it is \"too romantic\" when it comes to the lighting if that was a lighting setting. 

Almost all of the servers I have had in the past were great with timing, knowledge of the vast menu, friendliness and attention to your needs. The food is always great and I have never regretted my decision when ordering. The Red Sangria and Moscow Mules were perfect for drink choices. I even ordered an A.M.F. (a dangerously blue heavier alcoholic drink. Those who know understand) which was not even on the drink menu. I was surprised on how accommodating this location was. They even bring an extra plate if you are sharing a dish and have split it up before. I recommend the Shrimp Bistro Pasta or Chicken Madeira for a main entree and the Portabella, Avocado and Zucchini Fries for an appetizer. Those are just my go to choices. 

The only problem, as with every other Cheesecake Factory or Man vs. Food competition, is trying to reach that last bite and in this scenario it's the cheesecake. This cheesecake is probably more total calories than all the food leading up to it and it's worth it. If you ask for a cheesecake to-go container you will put it in the fridge only to open it up before bed and finish it.

I highly recommend this location and restaurant chain and don't forget to validate before leaving."}
{"text":"The food was good. We ate chicken Little's and the skinilicious turkey burger. Our waitress Melissa W. was great."}
{"text":"Food: my go to is on the Skinnylicious Menu - Lemon Shrimp. I always request a side of lemons to make it extra lemony. Cooked perfectly and just the right serving size.

Service: we grabbed hi-top seats in the bar area and our server was attentive.

Location: in The District - very convenient and parking was easy.

Would come back!"}
{"text":"Came by on a weekday for a late lunch for 2 around 2pm and surprisingly there was still a 1 hr wait. As we came close to our 1 hr mark we came by the restaurant again to check on our wait in line and saw 5 empty tables. I'm not sure if this is a marketing strategy or not but that's besides the point. We ordered the Buffalo blast to start and it was actually pretty good. Deep fried chicken skin with shredded chicken stuffing. I feel as though the stuffing could have been better if marinated differently or somehow changed because it felt like mush. The skin however was deep fried well and crispy. As an entree I ordered the Cajun jambalaya and I didn't finish it. My first taste of the pasta gave me a sense of disgust as it had the texture as if it melted in you mouth or it could have possibly been undercooked fresh pasta which tasted really 'dough-y'. I won't be coming here a second time."}
{"text":"Dirty glasses, dirty tea cup, bottom of dinner plate grimy...slow service.  Good ok but not as good as Henderson location.  Don't think I will come here again.  Definitely not up to par.  And the server \"joked\" that we were troublemakers because we expressed concern about dirty tableware.  Like we're supposed to drink from dirty glasses?  The tea cup was filthy inside and out!"}
{"text":"This place is in a beautiful area. The food is FANTASTIC! We ran into a small problem and I don't like to cause attention, I emailed them on their webpage and within minutes a manager contacted me. The small issue was addressed immediately. The customer service is phenomenal.  I was so impressed. I would highly recommend this restaurant and give it the best rating yelp allows. Thanks for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"Super service within a great environment! The dinner was great for the adults and kids as well."}
{"text":"Very much enjoying the \"Skinyliscious\" menu - makes ordering so much less treacherous so so many things sound pretty healthy but turn out to be terrible for you!

Ordered a burger and salad, and my burger came out well done (ordered medium-rare) and they quickly solved the problem.  Salad and dressing were great! Cheesecake - raspberry white chocolate truffle - AMAZING"}
{"text":"unorganized? and very confusing. The wait time is absolutely? ridiculous? and the management needs to get control on the set up for the lines for reservations, no reason I had to wait in a huge line up for 3 hours. 
Considering? how terribly unorganized? it was, my waitress was amazing.food was average"}
{"text":"Cheesecake is one of my favorite spots to have lunch on this side of town.

As with every experience there, the service was wonderful and our waitress had a great personality.

It's easy to get overwhelmed with the choices on the menu. Luckily, I stick with the smaller Skinnylicious menu. 

My favorite is the Mexican Tortilla Salad, which is always yummy, which has less than 590 calories.

Even though I wanted something sweet at the end of the meal, my waistline screamed at me to hold off, since it's now pool season in Vegas.

Overall, this experience at Cheesecake Factory was great! I highly recommend coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"Major food poisoning at this place.  Had diarrhea for 3 days 2 hours after eating there.  Wife vomited for 2 days.  First bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory.  Won't be going back to this location.  Found out others online have also had food poisoning here.  Health department needs to do some serious regular checking of this location."}
{"text":"By far the worst place I have been to. Wait time was expected so I won't mention it but the server was very unprofessional, slow and even rude. After the meal the server mixed up people's bill but she did not even correct them. The food was too salty that no one from my table was able to finish the food. I will not return to this restaurant and I highly encourage other's to not waste time here."}
{"text":"Although my boyfriend and I eat at Cheesecake factory often, eating at this location was definitely an out of ordinary experience.Things that went wrong with our meal: first the bread was cold, then one of the dishes went cold while waiting for the other dish to be ready, and finally, I bit into half a toothpick that was accidentally left inside my chicken breast. 

Yet despite the many mishaps that happened during our meal, our waiter and the manager provided the best service possible and were very apologetic. They redid both our dishes wonderfully and served as a new basket of bread. We even ended up getting the entire meal for free since the manager felt so bad for all the things that went wrong. 4 stars for the second batch of food and service! We will definitely be coming back during our next trip. :)"}
{"text":"they have the best cheesecake countrywide. We were able to get one to celebrate a friends birthday."}
{"text":"The service is pretty good, the food is ok however it seems as if they take more caution with the preparation of the dish than that of the taste. I had to return a dish however when they brought out my second choice, their cheeseburger that was pretty tasty, the patty was good and juicy with just the right taste. However their seafood selection is not the best tasting dish. In all fairness I have gone here a few times and I do try to give them the benefit of the doubt but it's not a 5 Star I keep hoping for them too. We dined in on 3/12/18 approximately at 11:30 am."}
{"text":"I had their beer battered fish tacos which were probably the best I've ever had. The only downfall was that the taco kept cracking straight through the centre having the whole thing fall apart because of the sauce. It was still enjoyable though with a fork! The cheesecake that we had was DEVINE. I can't believe how much i liked it. It truly tasted like a fererro roche. I will definitely be revisiting their cheesecake menu !"}
{"text":"Sorry that I even have to give this place one star our waitress had us sitting at the table for an hour with nothing but bread next thing the main course shows up not the appetizer then she has an attitude and tells me we did not order an appetizer when we did. Then she remembers we did and says she forgot about it. We didn't stay to see how the rest of the evening would go because once things go in this direction it only gets worse finished our wine paid for it and left."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. 

We shared the sliders, and guacamole. Sliders were good. The guac. was very bland, and had little more than moshed avocados. 

We shared a piece of cheesecake, the oreo. That was the best part of the meal. 

The menu is overwhelming IMO. Way to many choices."}
{"text":"My friend and I drove an hour to eat here for dinner. We received our appetizer and drinks after our food which was very upsetting. The food was great as always but the service definitely needs a little bit of help. I have worked in the restaurant business and usually when an appetizer is brought out after the food it's completely taken off the bill. Sad to say I don't know if I'll be back again"}
{"text":"An interesting experience.  Our party of 12 decided to have brunch here since it was our mothers choice for her birthday.  We checked in and waited a few minutes to have our table ready.  Kelsey a female server greeted us with water and mentioned she was assisting Mike the server who is taking care of our party.  Mike greeted us a few minutes after bread was served to take drink and appetizer orders.  We also got the kids food started while the adults needed a few more minutes to look over the menu.  Drinks were delivered promptly and appetizers were great but we're missing one child's meal (sliders).  There were no check back on appetizers so I mentioned the missing kids meal to MOD Dawn to cancel the order.  Our server took the adults food orders and staging was preset.  During food delivery there were a 2 ribeye steak entrees  overcooked as it was ordered medium rare and arrived as medium well.  MIKE took steaks away and fired new steaks.  Nick the other MOD came over and communicated the situation.  The new rib eyes were also delivered by nick and ensured to our liking.   Kelsey and Mike were doing great table touches, refills, and pre bussing our table.  We ordered a dessert for mom and the crew came to sing to her. Kelsey assisted to close out our check.  Dawn did a final check back on our party and gave me a business card.  I thank the staff for doing a great job on taking care of our party.   Will see you soon"}
{"text":"The server was busy.  But justin who ran our food was more helpful then the server.  Food is always on point quality but could use sense of urgency on service"}
{"text":"Excellent desserts, gr8 food and not bad service.  Love the chicken Romano, jambalaya, lettuce raps, stuffed mushrooms and menu variety.  Red velvet and strawberry cheesecakes are the bomb.  Service left a little to be desired as seating was cramped and waiter showed irritation w/requests.  Good Sunday brunch and nice bar menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal but very poor service. Was seated with Lara J. After she took our order she disappeared never came to check on us, waiting for her to refill our beverages for a long while. The whole time watching the other waitresses tend to their tables. When she finally came back it wasn't until we were already almost done with our meals. It just seemed like she didn't want to tend to us at all."}
{"text":"I would give this 0 if I could, not just for the food error, but for the extremely poor way that they handled it.
I went there after Elton John on 2/21/18 . I had told my friend what a great place this was.   My companion ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and asked for the sauce to be on the side. BBQ sauce can be sweet, smoky, vinegary, thin, thick, hot, like ketchup, like mustard, etc., you just never know.   He ate a couple of bites and said that it tasted funny. It was slathered with BBQ sauce

He is from Brazil and is not used to the usual American way of notifying the staff when something is wrong.  I told the waitress, who was sympathetic but since we did not want to have them recook the burger (it was almost closing time--I do not like to ask a cook to remake something a few minutes before closing time.) she did not adjust the bill and it was brought right out.  Nobody asked if we wanted cheesecake, no refills were offered, just the bill, quickly and not by our waitress but somebody else.

I asked to speak to the manager.  When the manager came, I explained that it just hadn't been a very pleasant night.  He took the bill, and said \"Keep your credit card, I'll take care of this.\" and brought cheesecake menus.  My companion ordered a cheesecake, and they brought the bill, again.

This time there was a free cheesecake, but no accommodation on the burger.  Full price. $15, which is top dollar for a hamburger.
  
I know that mistakes get made in the kitchen, but don't make a big show of doing something about it when you are not doing anything at all.


Another  friend told me to call  the next day, because perhaps the manager just didn't have a chance to adjust the bill , so I did.  I spoke to a manager named Joe, who listened and said he would get back to me, and of course never did. 

I understand you don't want to comp everybody who complains, but the error was clear, the food was made wrong.  I also don't mind paying for what was eaten.  I just don't like paying $15 for a burger that was not made right.


In my business we go by this philosophy:   MISTAKES HAPPEN  When they do:  1 Own it ,  2 Solve it Quickly,  3 Make it More than Right.   Something this Cheesecake Factory did not do. 

I brought it to the attention of the waitress,  I brought it to the attention of the manager and I brought it to the attention of another manager the next day.  I did not make a scene in the restaurant, I was as reasonable as I could be.   I can only conclude that they dug in their heels and wanted that $15 real bad.

You saved $15 on a cheeseburger, but you lost this customer for life."}
{"text":"I usually try to avoid going to the Strip as much as I can when visiting, because I hated being around the strip when I lived there, and I sure do not love it even now. However, my friends insisted on going to the Cheesecake Factory for brunch, and I haven't actually eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before (except that one time I tried their cheesecakes, which were pretty good), so sure, why not.

Located inside the Forum Shops at the Caesars Palace, this is definitely a touristy place. It's huge with lots of seating and it's located right in front of that aquarium thing with the show every hour or so. Actually, we chose to seat outside, and one of those shows started playing, which could be a bit annoying since they dim all the lights and it's really loud. 

Anyway, back to the food. I got the French toast. Overall, it wasn't bad. It was cooked well and the inside was nice and custardy. It wasn't too sweet either, which I really don't like on my French toasts, so that was a good thing! It was ok, didn't blow me away, but wasn't disappointing either.

The service was great. Our server was patient with us and regularly refilled our drinks. He even informed me that my food was going to take a while to be served, since the first batch got burnt. I definitely appreciated him letting me know that. 

Overall, food was decent and priced not outrageously. Service was nice! It's definitely one of those touristy places though. So if you're visiting, this would be a great place to dine. However, if you don't like touristy places, or just don't like being at the Strip, then you might want to consider someplace else."}
{"text":"I just love the Cheesecake Factory. My first visit to this one in Cleveland, Ohio.  I'll list cons firs
1. Opened late on a week day, until 12am.
2. Ordered Bang Bang chicken and teriyaki chicken. Both meals were delicious!!!!
3. Cheesecake at first, appeared small, but d/t the richness it was more than enough.
4. Great service, male waiter, checked in numerous time while we were there . Waiter kept are water glasses filled .
5.No wait in line for a table, preferred a booth waited only 5 minutes or less for a booth.
6. Price was descent 15-25 dollars for a meal
Okay, now the cons
1. We were sat at a booth that was positioned right behind these server.
3. Next con was sort of a freak accident of nature, after waiting for are cheesecake bug flew in one of the chesesecskes, the waiter immediately recognized the bug and took the cheesecakes away for a replacement. Of course , another 10 min wait, but the waiter did apologize. No harm done , because I hadn't eaten any.
Overall ,great restaurant would return."}
{"text":"We've given this place 3 tries - the last was so bad that we'll never go back. 2 drinks and a spinach dip was $36! (The drinks weren't high end nor were the prices listed). 
The service was the worst I've had in a long time. There were maybe 4 other tables in the whole restaurant (3 pm) and we hardly saw her. She was not the only server working.
Our water glasses were empty and never offered refills and our dirty plates sat until I finally asked her to clear. I am a server as well and tip generously if I receive good service but this was a 10% tip kind of server bc she was horrible. 
On a good note, the two previous times we did have the red velvet cheesecake and it was delicious."}
{"text":"We had a gift card from Christmas and decided to go on a Saturday. The \"small bites\" appetizer, PORTABELLA, AVOCADO, ZUCCHINI FRIES came out and were so delicious. Here is our complaint. What happened to our server after the food came out?  She was not to be found. We wanted our check, a to go container, and had ordered cheesecake to go at the end of our meal. She forgot about our previously ordered cheesecake and when she finally brought it, we had been waiting 20 min at this point. Not everybody that goes out to eat wants to be there for over 2 hours. The waitress had a lame made up excuse that the dessert counter was backed up. What a lie as we could see it from our table and it was dead. She just waited so long to go over to get it. She never refilled our drinks. The actual cheesecake I ate at home, \"chocolate chip cookie dough\" was tasteless and dry. Maybe I should have given 1 star but I do love the Asian chicken salad and my husband enjoyed his filet mignon. Eating out shouldn't be such a pain. The acoustics are also bad. We were near a screaming, crying toddler who was out clearly too late. This gave me a headache.  We left at about 945 pm and now had missed the movie we had planned to see."}
{"text":"I love the Cheesecake Factory. Went here for my birthday weekend in Vegas. While we waited for a table there was a Bath & Body that had great deals. I was able to pick up some Christmas gifts and Birthday gifts. I had the bbq chicken salad which was great. We didnt have room for desert."}
{"text":"I am VERY disappointed with my visit tonight. To start out I was told it would be a 45 minute wait, no big deal. I was expecting a long wait so that was fine. The problems began when We finally sat down (our party of 4) and  about 5 minutes went by, we were asked what we would like to drink (3 waters and a coke), the waitor took almost 10 minutes to get them to us. Then walked off 5 more minutes pass and we place our order (at 9:40 pm). The table beside us finished there meal, a new couple sat down. They ordered, there food was brought, they ate,paid there check and left. Still no food at our table. Finally at 11:00, two plates were brought to our table and about 5 minutes later the other two. The fries were so hard and old we didnt even eat them. When we finished eating I asked for the check, he asked if we wanted cheesecake, we all said no, he walked away, came back with a menu and said would yall like cheesecake. I politely said \"no, just my check\" he brought it then after what seemed like forever finally came back to take my card to run it. This was the worst experience I've ever had at a cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for an early dinner, we got unsweetened tea which was watered down. I got the veggie burger, very bland and it fell apart. And Brett got the BBQ chicken pizza he said that it was good, but a little undercooked. Overall the experience was very mediocre, we skipped the dessert because it looked like it came in frozen. There's nothing special about this place. We won't be back. We make better food at home."}
{"text":"Flys ruined the meal !!! Trying to celebrate my moms birthday . Spent the whole time swatting flys. 
I went and talked to manager who was chatting with another employee and told him what was going on. Barely acknowledged what I said . Never came to the table , never apologized for a crappy experience, nada!!
$160.00 plus tip which I had no problem paying because she did a good job. Never go there again"}
{"text":"Horrible service tonight , we just ate at there Henderson location next to our house last night. Excellent service. But this location at the north outlets sucks"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this chain countless times - probably over 50, maybe more - the prices are very very reasonable (on entrees) and the portion sizes are huge - you really should share (especially if you want to make it to dessert).

Their menu is as big as their portions - it is a ring bound folio.  

We have tried a lot of the dishes and it is probably easier to list those that haven't quite lived up to expectations (as that is a shorter list):

The meatloaf sandwich
Their brunch menu (just order from the regular menu)

Our favorite dishes are the miso salmon and the bang-bang chicken & shrimp.  My sister in law ate their calamari about 20 times on a recent vacation.

Their passion fruit iced tea is great and the complimentary bread basket is excellent.

Our favorite cheesecakes are the dulce de leche & pumpkin (only available for about 4 weeks a year).  The strawberry shortcake is very good if you don't feel like cheesecake.

This location is great of you are staying on the strip & have a car (and don't want to wait a long time at the location at the back of Caesars Mall in Caesars Palace)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night at around 8:45 and the place was pretty busy, the wait ended up being 50 minutes which is not too bad considering the usual wait time is over 1hr. Our server, Johnathan, was attentive and helpful. I ordered the pizza style chicken parm and it was amazing! My friend ordered the chicken Bellagio and it was nice as well. Both the dishes came with pasta which was prepared perfectly al dente. The only thing with the food is that it is a tad too salty for my personal taste. What really impressed me was that as soon as we were done with our plates they were cleared immediately. For dessert we couldn't really decide so we ended up ordering 3 cakes, Oreo cheesecake, hazelnut cheesecake, and the salted caramel cheesecake. They were all amazing but my favourite was the salted caramel. If you're in the Yorkdale area and wouldn't mind waiting I'd really suggest you give this place a try."}
{"text":"They are trying harder, that's evident at half price cheesecake days recently. We had the salmon and sugarless cheesecake. Ryan Lague explained each dish we ordered despite the huge crowd. He was so patient with us snd we were so impressed with his knowledge of the ccf. Paula Cardenas was really doing a great job handling the crowd. She listened to my story about ehat I forgot now and she didn't roll her eyes once!  I'm sure it was appropo to the situation."}
{"text":"I've been to other cheesecake factories before and LOVED it but this one was just a little off. The waiter we had, while very nice, was slow to come to our table compared to others across the restaurant. We had a party of two and watched a party of four who arrived and ordered after us, get their food first which was disappointing. 
As for the food, their menu is wide and vast. Almost too big in my opinion. With so many options it would be hard to make everything taste good. I'd rather have a restaurant focus on 10 entrees that they can do well rather than over 30 that are subpar. That being said, the prices are pretty high for food that is mediocre (or sometimes below). The only redeeming quality about this restaurant is of course their cheesecake - specifically the chocolate chip cookie dough, which while the price of these slices are also high, it's better worth your money to spend it on this than the food.  
I might be stopping in again to pick up some cheesecake to-go but I definitely won't be going back to dine any time soon."}
{"text":"The service and food was fine while we were eating there but our Togo meal was a hot mess to say the least. We ordered a dish with mushroom and asked for no mushrooms. After waiting about 10min for it to come out after we were done eating. We checked the order and it had mushrooms in it, the server said he did not hear no mushrooms, OK it happens so he had it remade which took about 15 more min. Really so it finally comes out. Did i mention that i have a 2 year old and an eight month old so patients are running thin, finally get home and my mom opens her dinner and what do you know MUSHROOMS. We called and spoke to a manager and they said sorry we will take it off your bill. Really just take that off my bill. We can have it remade for you if you would like but you will need to come and get it. But when you come please ask for Rob. Now I drove back and ask for Rob he had no idea what I was talking about with the order. AWESOME!! Retell the whole story and he is like sorry would you like a slice of cake!! Are you kidding me. I check it and finally it is right no mushrooms but interesting the sauce is a totally different color then the one we received, now I wonder Humm did they just try and pick out the mushrooms and not remake it. I'm a chef you can't fool me!! For real please and after all the bs it was not even good there was hardly any sauce on it and the pasta was so dry."}
{"text":"We were greeted promptly and seated.  The we waited for 10 minutes.  No one came to the table.  Finally when someone came over she was very nice and apologetic for not getting to us sooner.  
Ordered crab wontons and they were very good.  
I ordered the meatloaf and my daughter ordered the super burrito. Super burrito came out with the rice rock hard.  She had them take it back and it was too spicey for her so she had them bring out a shrimp pasta.  
I ordered the meatloaf.  Very heavy and flavorless.  Gravy was the only saving grace but tasted like a cheap canned gravy. 
We were given a complimentary desert for being ignored and it was excellent.  Not sure we would come back. Server was awesome.
I feel sorry for the head chef, menu is like a book.  Too many items.  They need to consolidate and focus on their star dishes."}
{"text":"Tried to place a to-go order. After being transferred to the bakery with 3 attempts and sitting on the phone for over 20 minutes and still nobody picking up - I'll find another restaurant tonight. Pretty disappointed in the outcome."}
{"text":"This location is great.  They are always clean and friendly.  They also have valet on weekends, starting on Friday nights which is helpful because this is a busy location with other shops that make parking busy.  The food is always awesome here.  Have had many items, like the avocado egg rolls, they come out hot and yummy.  The salads are always fresh here.  The filet was cooked perfectly as requested and the sides were great too.  Even though this place is busy and a bit noisy because of the crowd, the outside seating is quieter.  Our party also had the Chicken Mediera; it was very good as well.  Our party had multiple cheesecakes to share and they were ALL yummy! Service is always good here."}
{"text":"I have to agree with everyone.  The menu is extensive, which is a good thing.  No matter who you go with, you'll all find something you like.
BUT
I hate the atmosphere.  I hate the crowd.  I hate the NOISE!  I feel like part of a herd of cattle there.
They have one salad I like.  It's got walnuts, pears and a good raspberry vinaigrette.  
The cheesecake?  Well, being from NY, I find it mediocre.  
I got a gift card for CF last year for my birthday.  I re-gifted it."}
{"text":"I remember when TCF first came to Pittsburgh. Having been to them all of the country I thought it was about time. But the novelty wore off for me a long time ago. The food is ok. Nothing out of this world. Typical fare. However, when it comes to the cheesecake that's a different story. Never have I had a bad piece and I've had several. Really very decent for  box establishment."}
{"text":"This is my first Cheesecake Factory. There's a show that involves moving sculptures right outside that runs at an increment amount of time. Anyways, I just found out this restaurant serves more than just cheesecakes. But, it didn't matter because I just come here to try out their amazing different types of chessecakes."}
{"text":"Went on sunday 12/14/14 at 11am. We had our hearts set on the elvis waffle but it was no longer on the menu. They made it for us anyway! That was nice of them. The elvis waffle is a crispy belgian waffle with banana slices, peanut butter, bacon, and warm syrup. It's amazeballs. BRING BACK THE ELVIS WAFFLE, Y'ALL!"}
{"text":"Oh man, their menu is a visual maze but the food is definitely fantastic.

I think this is at least my 30th time at cheese cake factory, it just always ends up being the go to place for food for the people in my life. 

I ordered the 4 cheese pasta and man was it gear. Very cheesy and very rich in flavor. I believe it was topped with ricotta and mixing that in with everything made the texture especially delicious. 

Also had the margarita pizza. The thing about that pizza is it's not too heavy or greasy. The sauce is where it's at and its not a splatter of tomato sauce. It's smooth and hits the spot. Definitely a step up from cheese pizza, there isn't much of a difference anyway so I would say to just go for the margarita. 

I ate an ahi appetizer, forgot what it's called but it was delicious... Except it was a tad bit expensive for the amount I got. I was expecting bigger chunks of ahi but I understand that ahi is an expensive fish. I have yet to really understand the world of expensive food but I am getting there. 

Also the bread. Gotta love a place the gives out free bread. 

Overall, great place. They have tons of options, so it can get overwhelming, but that's why I recommend trying new things! Just go for it!"}
{"text":"I do love the Cheesecake Factory, but I'm grading this one on a 2/5 stars because of the quality of food we received. I'm sorry but stale cold nachos with stringy and chewy cheese is just unacceptable. I'm sure it doesn't take long to make a good hot plate of cheesy melty hot and creamy nachos right to order....so why not of made it a la minute before making the other entrees and having the runner bring it out when it was hot and ready to go? Or perhaps it was the runner's delay of bringing the food? Also, if a customer wants their burger medium and you give them a burnt black burger...that's not good."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to The Cheesecake Factory. It was a really nice Cheesecake Factory since it was inside The Forum Shops at the Caesar's Palace. This one had an outside patio for dining with a view of the pretty fish tank! Nice!

For this time around, I had ordered The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich with grilled Japanese eggplant, roasted bell peppers, red onions, melted mozzarella and garlic aioli on a toasted bun with a side of sweet potato fries. I asked the waitress if she would order my sandwich with the aioli on the side. When my dish arrive, I noticed that they did not place the aioli on the side (I am thinking that the waitress forgot to note it down), that  the eggplant was cut in quarters instead of being sliced thinly. What's the big deal, right? Well my Yelpers, trying to eat a chunk of an oily grilled eggplant inside a toasted bun smeared with garlic aioli and melted cheese and slippery grilled peppers makes it difficult to handle and eat. The eggplant kept slipping off my sandwich every time I took a bite. Hence, I decided to just take it off my sandwich and have a roasted pepper and cheese sandwich and eat the eggplant on the side. If they would change the cut of the eggplant, then the sandwich would definitely no be as messy to eat and enjoy, especially if you are paying like $15!

I tried the Chicken Madeira from a friend's plate. The chicken was very tender and juicy and the sauce was not too salty or bland, perfect! I also tried her mashed potatoes and loved that you can taste real potatoes! Definitely not potatoes out of the box and then scooped onto your plate haha. Great portion for two meals! Now that's a bargain. My friend, however, ordered the plate with no asparagus and it came with it anyhow. Thus, the waitress forgot to note it down as well. 

Overall, great dining experience! Service was okay since the waitress kept forgetting minor details and tried to get us to keep buying dessert even after we were obviously full and in a bit of a rush. She did bring us ton of bread to eat though.

{"text":"My grandson and his girlfriend went out to eat for her birthday.  They
are only 16 and the hostess sat them at a really crummy table right
by the hostess stand with no privacy at all and my grandson is tall
and it was a small table.  I feel they did that because they were young.
That was so unfair.  My grandson tipped well but I don't think I would have
given the circumstances.  It was a Friday night and early and there was not
a crowd there."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and my guest loved her Parmesan Pasta. I had a yummy crisp green salad with delicious blue cheese dressing. A basket of different styles of bread was included.
For a chain property I think they did a great job !!! Cheesecakes looked amazing but we passed on this visit. Just might go back and enjoy a slice."}
{"text":"It's my son in law's birthday. Got to say yes to his first choice because we never miss dining in this restaurant whether you're in California or just crossing the border in Buffalo. Finally the first restaurant to open in Toronto right at Yorkdale Mall. We must check it out. I find the seats spacious and especially the two seaters are not as crowded. Loved the ceiling decors. For appetizers, we ordered the tamales. Then came the baskets of bread and butter which are enjoyable. Diet forgotten again. had the fish tacos. Hubby ordered the salmon with cashew sauce (btw, price for this item was $28.95). Big mistake of not asking the price for its special lunch of the day. Others ordered Fish and chips, enchiladas, and Alfredo pasta. The portions from slim menu are still big so don't think you will get less calories. Might as well order from the regular menu and take home your leftovers. Of course, we can't leave without having their cheesecakes. Mango lime was just refreshing after a big meal. Others orders the dulce Cheesecake, celebration and double chocolate. Perfect to end the meal. Service is excellent!  Hope it stays this way cuz we're loving it!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I've had Cheesecake Factory! Location is great and food is always amazing. I would have gave it 5 stars but the host in the front was a little confused and rude. We were called up and she specifically said my cousin's name. My cousin went up there and said that's me. She pretty much looked at her and ignored her then looked at another group. My cousin repeated to her and said \"that's me\" then the host asked the other group \"are you....\" and they said no. She didn't even say sorry! Haha but I mean, the food and the server made up for everything. We ordered the fried calamari, Nashville hot chicken nuggets, chicken & biscuits and miso salmon. Oh my gosh! I forgot hot delicious the bread was and the food. I was so excited and starving. The food came out SO FAST! I was literally surprised because it was busy. Your entree coming out before your appetizers? LOL I will take that any day! Great portion size and so flavorful. We also ordered a side of ice cream with two slices of fudge cake. I know.. I know!! We didn't get cheese cake but that's the beauty of this place.. you can have your favorite cakes if you don't want the cheese cake :) I can't wait to go back! I want more of that biscuit. So delicious! Honey, creamy and just everything I want in every bite. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, it has been many years since I have had an actual meal here. The only reason I come is for the to die for cheesecake. It used to be that I would typically get the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, which by the way, is sinful. Well, I guess they all are. It has an Oreo crust, chocolate chips throughout and on the top, and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side. Then they introduced the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I'm like, seriously, Cheesecake Factory? It has a moist, red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake. It also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting. I came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token (as my husband puts it, yeah right!). I got the Cookie Dough slice and then I noticed the Red Velvet which I thought was just a limited time. So what was an indecisive girl to do but get both slices. $16 later (yikes!) but I am the happiest girl in the world."}
{"text":"This used to be my absolute favorite go to restaurant for the last several years. Anytime we had a special occasion we have always gone to the cheesecake factory. My birthday is January 28 and we went there to eat Sunday the 29th. To give them credit it was an insanely busy day, but that was no excuse for the horrific tasting food that they put in front of me. I ordered the sweet corn tamales and I've never ordered anything else there because those are my absolute favorite things. The plate was scolding hot the food was stone cold it tasted horrible even my guests tasted it and couldn't believe how nasty it was.

One of my friends ordered the cheeseburger with bacon on it and macaroni and cheese and ordered it medium-well... it came out about as raw as steak tartare!!!! They brought her burger then eventually they brought her bacon and even later they finally brought her fries. She ordered ranch dressing to go with her fries and it tasted awful. She's just a young girl and she was so embarrassed and thought she had done something wrong because her meals so bad that my insisted they take it off my tab. Her mother ordered the chicken Parmesan with carrots and mashed potatoes. She said it was actually quite good except that the carrots or better and not at all what she expected from the description on the menu. 
All in all, we were there for four hours from the time we sit down at our table until the time that we finally were able to leave. 

Our meal was handled so poorly by the manager that I decided to find a new favorite place for my birthday. This actually makes me quite sad, but I can always order takeout cheesecake, and I found a copycat recipe for my sweet corn tamales. So if I really want them that bad I'll make them myself.

Our waitress was actually quite good, it just wasn't her fault that the food was coming out slowly and was not prepared correctly. She was delightful and really tried hard to keep us from getting out of sorts."}
{"text":"This is a five star review because of one amazing waitress! Georgina is the best waiter! We went here for our anniversary and she gave some of the best customer service we have had. She was friendly, attentive, and personable! She spotted a problem before we even mentioned it. When our food arrived the dinner portion seemed a little small but before we told her she walked by and said that doesn't look like a dinner portion- and rushed the plate off to have it fixed. Thank you Georgina!"}
{"text":"I've been to many different locations but this one is by far my favorite. One of the ladies, Melissa, who often answers the phone and gives me my to-go orders is always friendly and helpful! 

I wish they'd offer an employee discount so I could justify ordering every day but the service and food is so good that I still order regularly regardless!"}
{"text":"The best time to come to the Cheesecake Factory is Saturday or Sunday for lunch.  The reason is there's a separate brunch menu that's available only from 10 to 2 on weekend days.

Dan tried the Chicken and Waffles from the brunch menu and was very happy. Don't forget the syrup with them both in one huge bite, YUM!

Mary went with the Asian Salad with Chicken on the \"light menu.\" It was nicely chopped, very fresh and massively huge! I must remember for next time. A+

Since it was Fathers Day weekend we split one piece of cheesecake....OK, any nearby holiday is a fine excuse to indulge.

We settled on Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake. We enjoyed it, but probably should have stuck with our old favorite: Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake! To. Die. For."}
{"text":"Always a wait but now I've befriended my favorite server and I ask to be seated in his station...the wait isn't so long anymore!  Great service, good food and always a good time!"}
{"text":"Worth service ever, we wait 45 minutes for appetizers and over an hour for the food. I told the waiter I have milk allergy and he served my chicken with cheese, my sisters order steak and didn't get steak knives. Waiters brought the check with out pen. Manager was rude and smell like ashtray, I guess he was mad we bothered him during his smoke break."}
{"text":"Tonight I tried something new and it was amazing! I ordered the Steak Diane and it was yummy! The flavor combinations were perfect and my steak was cooked exactly how I asked. The best part was desert. I typically say I'm going to try a new cheesecake and then get my tried and true Oreo cheesecake. Tonight I decided to go out of my comfort zone and went on description of our server: Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cheesecake. It was amazing! If you like German Chocolate cake, this is a must have!"}
{"text":"The menu is long so many good options. We get a salad to start . Arrived on time for lunch menu the first waitress is friendly but she is on time for leave her shift then a second waitress no much friendly and rush the thinks around her name is Denisha. No make time pleasant this is why 2 star"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon. We were told that we will be seated in 2 and a half hours but we weren't and the small device we were given didn't beep so after 3 hours we asked them and were seated right away.

I ordered the calamari, four cheese pasta with chicken, and hazelnut nutella cheesecake. The calamari was really yummy and a big portion The best i have tasted and it was sweet of them to give us extra for the extra time we had to wait. We also got a chocolate bread and white bread while waiting which wasn't good. The four cheese pasta was such a huge portion i couldnt finish it as it was too heavy and it was a bit bland so it was just average. The show stopper was the cheesecake. It was light and sweet with the hazelnut crunch it was so yummy with the nutella on top. They sang happy birthday to me which was sweet. Our waitress was sweet and attentive but took long to serve us. 

My mom ordered the bistro shrimp pasta which I really didn't like. Others ordered the Evelyn' favourite pasta and ordered the carbonnara pasta. For dessert they ordered the coffee and cream cheesecake and fresh strawberry cheesecake. They really enjoyed their cheesecakes."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Cheesecake Factory and my past experiences weren't the best. However, either they got better over the years or this particular location is extra awesome, cause we very much enjoyed ourselves!
There was a slight wait to be seated but it was a weekend night. There's a good atmosphere overall and once seated the service was fast and efficient.
The food was great! I had the steak medallions with mushrooms sauce and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"I took my friend who was visiting from out of town here for a nice restaurant experience.  Boy did we get an experience... My boyrfriend and I decided to share the factory combo of herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi.  The salmon  was horribly undercooked in the middle!  I told the waiter and he tried to tell me that it wasn't and that if I wanted I could get another cooked piece.  At this point I was disgusted and wanted to order something else on the menu.  The waiter then came back and jokingly said okay you only have to pay half price for the combo since we only got half a meal :/ He then said he convinced the managers to comp. the meal.  I got my second plate of food which was also not very good.  Disgusted and disappointed I decided that we were just going to order our desert and get the check.  The combo had been comped as promise and we paid our bill.  Whatever change was left, we gave to the waiter.  As we were gathering our things he had the audacity to complain to us about his tip and said that he got us a free meal and spouted off some more bs as he walked away.  Never in my life have I had this happen to me.  We tipped the appropriate percent and he felt it wasn't enough and came to us, the patrons, and complained about something he should be grateful to receive.  This was TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  I then told the managers and they were outraged.  They told me that it was the waiters idea to only deduct half for the combo plate and theirs to comp the whole thing.  Not only was this waiter, named REX (?), rude and out of line, he was a LIAR.  The manager there was very apologetic and proceeded to the bakery to give me my choice of deserts.  This however, does not change the fact that we had a horrible, bland, undercooked meal and were treated like scum by their greedy rude waiter.  My friend from out of town never wants to eat at a Cheesecake Factory when she comes to Las Vegas ever again.

I should note that the lunch specials are pretty good when I go here to eat during work.  Tonight was the worst and is going to turn me away."}
{"text":"Have been to various Cheesecake Factories throughout the US so was waiting until
the excitement of its opening and crowds wore down.  Well thats not happening so fast.  My daughter picked up a buzzer at 10:50 am, restaurant opens at 11:30 and we were told to come  closer to the restaurant around 11:40.  By then there was a long line up in the mall.  We were seated by 11:50 which was great.  It seems they have figured out the flow of seating better than what I read at their start.  We ordered lunch sized salads (my fave Santa Fe, a Cobb and a Chicken Avocado).  Happy to report the wheat bread and salads were exactly the same as we expected.  The major disappointment was the iced tea.  Was looking forward to unsweetened tropical yet they don't have it and the alternative was some strange flavour that tasted sweetened?   Please please bring north that tea.   We bought 5! slices of cheesecake to take home.  Very pricey and I recall the slices being bigger but still yum. Overall we enjoyed our lunch. Shout out to Amanda who was a terrific waitress.  Will I go back? Yes. But not until the wait times are reduced.  Welcome to
Canada Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"This location of cheesecake factory was reasonably nice.  All the typical things that you would expect.  They have that crazy long menu, even at lunch.  I decided to try something from their low calorie menu today, getting the grilled chicken dish.  Overall, there wasn't anything bad about it, it just wasn't all that great.  No one in our party seemed all that excited about their food, again, nothing really wrong, just their standard faire.

The service and management at this location were top notch though making it possible to still have a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"The best aspect of TCF is the ambiance. The interior of the restaurant is an Egyptian theme (I don't see the connection) and it is perfectly lit and outfitted for a dining experience. The food is so-so, with reasonable prices. The cuisine is a mix of traditional and American. I enjoyed our waiter, who seemed to be a Marketing major at ASU by the way his conversation with us led. I enjoyed myself during the dinner, and obviously loved the cheesecake afterward. I'll be back, but I'm not sure when. It's a bit out of the way from my neighborhood, and the area has a lot of options. I think Mastro's is next...."}
{"text":"The wife and I were wandering around looking for a decent place to eat lunch and finally settled on the Cheesecake Factory. It was honestly the first place we saw in the forum shops which didn't make either one of us go \"meh\". 

I didn't feel like a burger so settled on a spicy crispy chicken sandwich. It really didn't have a spice to it but it didn't taste too bad. The service was excellent, however. I go thru a ton of pop refills, especially when I'm out walking and wandering, and the server was on it. 

There wasn't a wait to get seated, but they made us go upstairs - wait, there's a 2nd floor to a restaurant on the forums, it must have an awesome view! - nah, don't get too excited. It's a small, enclosed space with the only view being that of the other tables. The middle is cut out so you can look down on the bar, but that's about it."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory is absolutely terrible. Not just once or twice have we had a problem. Every time we come to this location the staff is disrespectful and inconsiderate. 
I am giving them two stars just for the taste of the food.
The other three stars are being subtracted for the service this location gives. Today's experience consisted of me walking in to order one slice of cake to go. It was the truffle cake. Usually the thing is pretty big. But not today, it was half the size it usually is. When I asked the worker her response was I was wrong that it's smaller than usual. She told me I Must of got the last slice the other 25 times I've bought the same cake. 
She had terrible customer service. I waited for a few minutes then asked for a manager. When I told the manager it was smaller she said it did look smaller and she would get another slice. She came back and told me they measured it and it was the right size but they would give me a different slice. They came back with it and it was bigger than the first one but the same as the others I've gotten over the years. 

It may sound so petty to complain about a slice of cake being half the size of what they usually serve but when I get told I am wrong about what I have received before, it rubs me the wrong way."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome. Our food was great. The atmosphere however was absolutely insane! We were seated next to a large family with five small children who ran amok screaming at the top of their lungs. The manager spoke to them several times to no avail. Our waitress Victoria took the best care of us and we tipped her generously. Others would be seated in our section and would ask to be moved. We did not get dessert. If you eat here be sure to not sit next to people with small children. If you have small children please don't ruin dinner for everyone near you. Teach your children manners and have respect for those eating around you."}
{"text":"We cam here on for happy hour during National Cheesecake Day. Happy hour is M-Sat from 4-6p. Sadly, they do not have any drink specials during happy hour. :(
The food though, is amazing! $5.50 for actually small plate sizes, which is a lot. I made the \"mistake\" of ordering 3 apps for the 2 of us, so much food! We ordered the mac and cheese balls, cheese and spinach dip and southwest chicken rolls. Everything was really good though the cheese and spinach dip could have benefited with some seasoning. The mac and cheese balls and the southwest chicken rolls were very hearty, we had to take a lot of food home with us. 

What I did not like was how much the Long Island Iced Tea costs (I docked 1.5 stars for this), I blew $10.70 for a watered down drink. It did not feel like that much alcohol was in there. I won't be buying drinks from here again. 

The half off THE FIRST SLICE of cheesecake was a great deal, my boyfriend and I each bought a slice. I got the caramel turtle while he got the tiramisu. The caramel turtle was amazing, wasn't too cream cheesy and had the right amount of sweetness. The tiramisu was just meh, I wouldn't get it again. 

Don't forget to complete the feedback survey, you get $10 ecredit towards your next purchase. Pretty worth it if used during happy hour (there is no fine print saying you can't)."}
{"text":"An eternal wait even if you come at off times. Been waiting like an hour for food after waiting 40 mins to get seated. Also bf's credit card info got stolen here last visit"}
{"text":"Went during Sunday at lunch. Slight delays in service, but food was great as it always is. Only minor criticism is that they overcooked the chicken breasts on all of our meals so it came off as a little chewy and dry."}
{"text":"Okay, I love the cheesecake factory. This review isn't about that. This is based on my incredibly disappointing dining experience.
I ordered the peppered shrimp and plantains and I was really excited because it had plantains and I love plantains. But when it came-- late I may add-- there were no plantains. Finally I flagged down the waiter and asked where the plantains were. He said they were \"backed up\" and he would bring them second. So, I waited. And waited. And waited. Twenty something minutes later, my plantains came. Everyone else had already eaten. My food was then cold. 
I know it wasn't my waiter's fault, but my food did not come out as it was supposed to. And when I asked to have it comped, he acted like I was being ridiculous. He made a face at me and all but refused to send a manager over.
If you don't love plantains like I do, it might be hard for you to understand, but basically I paid 20$ for shrimp and plantain curry and got only shrimp. To me, it was not unlike ordering nachos and having them come without the cheese. Or ordering a salad and having it come without the dressing. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"I wish I could put the review higher and most of the Cheesecake Factories I have been to in the past were great. Great food and service, but this one leaves a lot to be desired. The only reason I am putting 2 stars is because my husband really liked the Bacon Burger he got. Otherwise, the other food we got was either missing something or mediocre at best. But I am getting ahead of myself. We went on a Saturday afternoon around noon. The place was hoping, but we were able to be sat right away. Our waitress was \"ehh.\" She took our order relatively quickly, but getting our drinks, bread, and food took forever. It took probably about 20-25 minutes for our meals to come out, which when you have hungry kids - can seem like a lifetime. I think the worse part for the waitress was the fact that after we ordered cheesecake to go and already paid for it. She wandered back to our table asking if we wanted to order cheesecake. I had to remind her we already did and were waiting on it so we could leave. Forgetfulness, especially in a server, is not a good thing. Okay the food. My husband liked his bacon burger and had no complaints on it. My kids seemed to like their kids meals, but honestly it is not too hard to make spaghetti and a grilled cheese. I guess were I am the most disappointed is in the Cuban Sandwich I ordered. Half of the sandwich was missing a key ingredient (roast pork) and the other half just had a chunk that was probably only 1/3 of the sandwich half. Then the ham. It was half a slice on each side. The pickles were plentiful, but sending a Cuban that is missing most of the meat was not only sad, but also gave off a feeling of \"scrimping\" on the ingredients. I would expect that maybe from a cheaper \"deli\" but the fact I paid $15 for this sandwich, I expected more. It had been over 4 years since the last time we went to a Cheesecake Factory and based on the service and food quality it probably will be longer before we return again. The cheesecake was good. We opted for the Godiva and the Celebration cheesecake. We would not get the celebration again. Too many competing flavors and not enough cheesecake."}
{"text":"I haventnt eat here for a while..Why? because I ate there way too often and kinda got tired of it. I loved CCF and this last trip reminded me why.

We went as a big group and sat at a round table.Our server was cordial and attentive and as a former CCF employee I know the whole drill they must do. She missed a couple of things here and there but who cares...I never agreed with their long introduction anyways.

Our order placement was simple and it went smooth..for the most part. She forgot to take my order and had to call her back ..no biggie it happens to be best.

I really liked the fact that they have a Skinny \"B\" menu (as my gay best friend calls it) and I can get some very tasty food without feeling like I will end up like Jabba the Hutt. I had the tartar and it was delicious, fresh and tasty! Small yes..but that's the price of low calories.

To close my meal I ordered the margaretha flat bread and it was delicious as well.. after eating my stuff of course I started eating my friends food and had a taste of the HUGE nachos..and when I say huge I really mean it..that was a mega plate ..priced very good as well!

Salads were big and tasty! In general, CCF always tastes good , from its bread to the desert.

Our server was super nice and attentive.she even split the bill in 8 without a single issue. I really liked that touch.

As long as there is not a long waiting time (which there usually is) I will continue to come to their spot due the ambiance, music ,service and of course food. Well done CCF"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory at Crocker park is big, crowded and overrated.   I had dinner yesterday at around 6 PM.  It was packed.  Had a veggie burger, and it was good.   Service was fine.  The menu is huge, so there are lots of options (salads, sandwiches, pastas...), but it all has this mass-produced feel that makes it somewhat boring.  Also was sitting about 15 inches away from a young couple (on a date?) that weren't really talking and me being right there made it feel even more awkward.  Seating arrangements seem designed to fit as many people as possible."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory at the outlets downtown! What's not to like? I'll list what there IS to like first.

1) Giant covered patio with fans so you enjoy the outdoor feel, but are insulated from outlet traffic and direct sunlight.
2) Very willing and able to split checks. I went with 7 friends and our waiter offered to split the check for us; we didn't even have to ask.
3) Someone constantly checking on you. If my water glass hit 75% full, it was promptly filled back up. We were also asked at least twice if our food was all cooked to our liking.
4) Those bread baskets. If you haven't been to Cheesecake Factory and are opposed to chain restaurants, at least go enjoy a complimentary bread basket and a latte. 
5) The food is delicious and amazing and they hit every price range. You can spend $50 on yourself for dinner, or $10 and still leave satisfied and happy. 
6) Contrary to what most people would think, this is a great restaurant to go to if you're gluten-free or gluten intolerant. They mark menu items with a GF option so you can have a ton of items modified to be gluten-free (pasta, flat breads, sandwiches, salads, etc.).

The only negative I can think of is the fact that this restaurant is crowded. I wouldn't recommend it for an intimate occasion. The customer to server ratio has got to be 5:1. I've never seen so many servers in one place. It's good because you get a ton of attention, but can be annoying when you're trying to walk to your table and walk to the bathroom and have to wait for a lot of people to pass."}
{"text":"What can you say about Cheesecake Factory that most don't already know. 
Went with a group of 10 and the wait on a Friday was approx. 45 minutes. Once seated and drinks orders were taken I was quickly informed that the only beer I wanted on Tap was not working, go figure, so I didn't order any other type simply because I wanted that particular beer. 
Cheesecake Factory always seems to be overwhelming to me in the menu and there is so many options and looking at the menu I soon realize I have not idea what I want. Since I have been to this restaurant before Yelping, I have tried a few items but overall never been extremely satisfied with the quality of the meals. 
With that being said, this day I easily ordered The Club Sandwich, in hopes that it would be better than just standard for a sandwich, but again, its just a sandwich. 
The Service was somewhat slow but nothing out the ordinary since it was Friday night and we were a big group, however, the Manager did stop by the table and apologized for the extended wait on the appetizers and said she would take care of the cost on those since they were not out after 30 minutes, Thanks Manager. 
Right after apps came out the main entries showed up and while I wasn't overly excited about my Club I was impressed with the appearance of the plate. 
Of course Club sandwiches are stacked so unhinging my jaw to take a bit is always fun and this Club certainly proved to be about standard in taste and appearance. I was finally happy with something I had ordered although I only ate half the Club (gotta save room for Desert) 

Desert was Adams Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and certainly without a doubt worth every penny! 

Hats of to the waitress for giving me updates on the beer tap, however, they never got it working so went beerless but I do appreciate the attempt. 

Overall, this experience was good and my food was improved from the other times (pre-yelping) but I did only order a Club Sandwich. 
I would return with others but certainly not on my top priority of restaurants to eat at, even with the award winning cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Best place for me when I have a few extra bucks (and being a a 20 year old college kid that pays his own tuition that's rare) but when I do go, I am given not only great food (CHICKEN FETTUCCINE ALFREDO IS TO DIE FOR) but awesome service. Being a waiter myself they kind of inspire me to try new methods. I always tip over 25% they're that great"}
{"text":"Had a very good experience here last night with a large group of about 10.  The food was very good, the usual Cheesecake Factory menu.  The service was what made the experience excellent though.  The waitress was very nice, she didn't even flinch when we asked her to split the check about 5 ways."}
{"text":"Service was great the food was awesome one of the best cheese cake factory we have visited. Love the skinny-   menu the ice tea was fresh and the bread was served warm . We will be back"}
{"text":"We come to Cheesecake Factory every year for my birthday. This experience, by far, was the most amazing birthday I've ever had at Cheesecake. We had two servers, Justin and Corey. Justin was so helpful and attentive. He was very kind and polite - he gave us more than enough time to decide on entrees!

Our other waiter, Corey, did a phenomenal job of helping us with our dessert options (he made a plan with my husband to surprise me! How cute!!!!). His charisma, patience, and welcoming vibe made all the difference in our experience. Not only do I highly recommend this Cheesecake location, but I highly recommend Corey as a server. If I knew he would be my server, I'd come to Cheesecake at least once per week!! We will definitely be back and requesting him to serve us!!

{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory offered an inviting lunch venue today.  A full sun, morning in July with a temperature of 108°F already, can leave a shopping clan of adults and children weary, parched and irritable. 

Upon our entry, the service was cheerful, immediate, and helpful. Our table service from James was hospitable and accurate. The Kids' Menu was varied. The proportions were generous. My son opted for grilled salmon, sauteed carrots and French Fries. My daughter's plate had crispy, moist chicken tenders fresh fruit and also French Fries. The chicken was surprisingly lightly battered rather than a dense mass.

Thank you Cheesecake Factory for a family friendly day in Las Vegas. A 5 star day for me is a menu with lots of organic options."}
{"text":"Can't begin to count the number of times we have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory at Arrowhead nor the number of Cheesecakes in the chain...From Boston to LA and lots of places in between.   Consistency is the name of the game when it comes to this chain.  Always great food, always great locations, always always always great service. In fact we comment that we have never had a bad meal nor have we ever had bad service.  May not be the most creative place but you never go away unhappy on any account."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience  here and our server was great. Unfortunately my meal was just subpar. I had ordered fish & chips and the fish was soggy wish they were crunchier... my birthday cheesecake was AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. 

Right off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. 

I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. 

When the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"Gene was great as our waitor.  Can't say the same for my Orange Chicken.  The chicken and rice was dry and boring. No spice and hardly any flavor. I have had better at the local Chinese restaurants and Jo Jo China Bistros. Try anything else but this dish."}
{"text":"If I could do 2 1/2 I would but I can't so I'll go with a solid 2 stars. Food was decent. Good spices and the chicken was tender but more pasta then chicken. Two people spent $85 not all that"}
{"text":"Hmm, I've heard really good things about this chain from people I trust, but I am not buying what they're selling.  I went to the Bayshore Mall Milwaukee location and now this new one in Madison, and experiences were pretty similar.

I'll be straight-forward, this restaurant just seems like an overpriced mess of dishes with little to no direction on the overall experience.  Walking in, they clearly had way too many employees, as most of them were standing around talking to each other or walking right by tables that needed attention but for some reason weren't getting it.

Thankfully our personal server was extremely friendly and also quite helpful (I believe his name was Jeremiah).  My Dad and I had no idea what to order as we paged through their Tom Clancy sized novel of a menu, but he had 4-5 recommendations that all sounded up our alley and answered questions as they came.  I settled on the Teriyaki Chicken for a whopping $17.  It was tasty and the portion size was agreeably large.  I think for that amount of money I'd rather be wowed a bit, but I can't complain too much because I did still enjoy the dish.  Complimentary bread was also noice, and overall made up for the bizarro-land atmosphere inside and equally crazy menu.

I think this might be the spot to go for large groups where you have potentially picky eaters, as there's no way someone will go hungry, but I'd be hard pressed to find another excuse.  Maybe I'm being too harsh as the food is reasonable (and was so in Milwaukee too) but I'd like to see them do something with the open space and show a bit more attentiveness to the tables as a whole (again, not our server but in general).  It's early in the going for them though, so time will tell. . ."}
{"text":"I can order anything on their menu at any location and can expect to always have awesome meal with great service and this location is certainly no exception.  

Service was spot on, location was awesome next to all the great stores at Forum shops, and the food was excellent. 

My favorite item has to be their chicken nachos...gotta try these! Main entree was the ribeye, seriously...for not being a steakhouse; their steak was cooked perfectly and had perfect flavor overall a perfect steak. I think they can give Flemmings and Ruth's Chris a run for their money as their steak is about $20 less and includes a side. 

Once again...a Cheesecake Factory has provided an excellent experience and a desire to come back soon."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had the chicken costeletta ( not sure if I spelled that right). It was amazing! Love the lemon cream sauce!! Expensive (as expected) but very delicious. Also had the vanilla bean cheesecake and was not disappointed. Really good experience just very expensive. Just me and the bill was over $30 but the portion was huge and I ate it for lunch the next day as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for Valentines Day. The staff did an amazing job of getting us seated as soon as they could. We were told an hour wait (which we expected) and we were seated within 30 minutes. 

However, I ordered the FARFALLE WITH CHICKEN AND ROASTED GARLIC and it was so salty. I'm normally I person that puts garlic salt on everything but this was intense!!!

Super disappointed..."}
{"text":"Hey LV Yelpers!

I came here the other day for lunch with my bf. It was my second visit here and his first visit to this location. They open at 11am.

I love that CF has such a large menu selection and I noticed that they expanded their menu too! So there's something for everyone.

Since my few last visits at CF here and in LA... I've been a fan of their miso salmon! If you like fish you have to try it!

Great customer service and I love that they have outdoor seating.

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I went here on my lunch break today and ordered a salad to go. The girl at the dessert counter took my order and told me that it would be a 15-20 minute wait, and that I could sit on the bench by the door and she would bring my food out when it was ready.  About 15 minutes later, I noticed her place a bag on the counter. Five minutes later, she put another order up on the counter. Since nobody said anything, I figured they weren't mine. After waiting about 15 more minutes, I went up to the counter and asked if my food was ready yet. She said, \"oh yeah. Here's your salad\". It was the first order that had come out 15 minutes earlier, but nobody mentioned it to me. The food was good, but the service was lacking."}
{"text":"I mean if you have a thing for Cheesecake, you go to the factory! I never had bad Cheesecake from here. The atmosphere is quite romantic, at dinner time, you don't have to worry about seeing the real face of your date, cuz the light is really low, guarantee anything would look better in that lighting they set up for ya. 

The food is also pretty good, huge portion!! I can't never finished my food. Cheese bread appetizer for $9 is ridiculous when I comes in 6 pieces and the cheese doesn't even melted all the way. I expected more from $9 appetizer. 


Big parking lot with specific 15 mins parking spot for pick up order."}
{"text":"It was packed since it was weekend/dinner time/Fathers day, we were told that the wait time will 20-30 minutes.. we were seated at exactly 30 minutes. The host was really nice.. our server was really nice too and attentive to our needs. It was another good experience in this restaurant. Truly a place for special occasions"}

{"text":"I am literally leaving this place as I take the time to write this review. This was one of the worse dining experience which is sad because Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant in the USA. 

My partner and I were ready for the long anticipated wait (we read the reviews beforehand and expected to wait approximately 2 hours) so we went for dinner a little later (around 9:00 PM). When we got here we got led around because there was a line to just get a buzzer (which mind you went by fast). As we got to the buzzer counter the lady said the wait time was 1 hr (which got us exited cause we expected to wait longer). But 1.5 hours go by and we were still not buzzed so we went to inquire. The lady said 15-20 mins more which totaled to 2 hrs before we were buzzed in. Then we waited just a lil more to be seated. We had ample time to look at the menu so we ordered our entrees right away. Having been to this franchise multiple times in many states I chose to get my regular dish: the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Of course the time it took to prepare it was understandable (20 mins approximately) and 2.5 hours later we finally get served our dishes. 

My pasta looked great but when I took my first bite I was utterly disgusted. The pasta was overcooked and it tasted like dough. The shrimp and chicken was cooked right but the pasta was off. I took a couple of bites to make sure and my partner agreed it was off (the pasta was overcooked). It tasted like I was eating dough so I had to return it and chose to just get another faster dish (cause I did not want to wait another 20 mins). I decided to get the baja chicken tacos.  That ended up taking another 20 mins To arrive! In between the management came to apologize to us about our dish which I thought was nice but it was pointless considering we were still charged for the pasta and the tacos. I had to send the receipt back again to get the pasta removed (which they erased as a \"comp serv\"). I'm surprised I managed to keep my cool the entire night. This place is a mess. The food was not worth the wait. I felt bad for our server cause he had to run back and forth cause the kitchen or management kept screwing up. The service was wonderful but I can't blame the workers for the mess this restaurant is. 

I waited 3.5 hours to just eat! And I seriously lost my appetite by then. It would have been faster if they had not screwed up and made me wait an additional hour. I am very disappointed in this restaurant. 

You have tainted the experience for me. This is my favorite restaurant in the states and I can't believe I will never be stepping into his one again. I rather drive to the border than dine here.   

I do want to add that we did end up getting the Tuxedo cheesecake and it was delicious! The only thing about the night that gave it some light.  

Don't fall for the hype. If you want some cheesecake just order it to go. I hope they 
will be able to live up to their reputation cause so far it's not looking good."}
{"text":"Okay so its a pretty place I will definitely say that. The inside was crowded so I decided to sit outside. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful and was the best part of our experience. everything was prompt. That's the best I can say. Now the cons, They didn't have the heaters turned on outside, our glasses were filthy. I ordered the chicken Alfredo. It was really under cooked, and the sauce was pure liquid, and it tasted soupy, the chicken was tough and THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY FOOD. I made them take it back and fix it. Came back perfect. My husband ordered some seafood pasta dish he loved it. I ordered the linda chocolate cake and it was EXTREMELY DRY. our total came out to 77.00 and I am probably not coming back based on how much of a let down the food was."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Cheesecake Factory in Omaha Nebraska so this review is in comparison to that location.  The luau salad was good, the fried fish dinner was bland needed some seasoning. The fries have little or no salt and needed some seasoning.'

Our server was excellent.

This location has not been open very long, so perhaps Quality will get better over time

The long wait was not worth it for this location."}
{"text":"EXTRA \"SPECIAL\" INGREDIENT

Girl who seated us had a bit of an attitude so I guess the experience kind of started on a sour note, but that's not important enough to be the factor that makes or breaks my dining experience. Food was pretty much as expected, waitress was nice etc. The reason for the 2-star rating was that my husband found a large hoop earring in his salad. Like, large enough that we thought maybe it was a bracelet but it was hard to tell for sure because it was all bent up and slathered in salad dressing. How did they miss that? How did it even get there?! Eww. They were very good about replacing his meal but I don't think we will be returning because I would be worried about what else could have ended up in our food."}
{"text":"I think cheesecake should be at the top of the pyramid but only if the food pyramid was flipped over!!!! Went here for lunch with my Candy friend, yes that is her name and no she doesn't take her ropa off for a living. :) Anyways, I had the Thai Chicken Pasta, which I loved. She had the Pasta Da Vinci. We both enjoyed our pastas, but the main event of the lunch was our \"Dulce de Leche\" cheesecake. Ahhh....did I mention cheesecake should be at the top of the food pyramid, but only if the wide side is at the top? On a side note, I really like this place because I can connect with their history. Small beginnings and look where the business is when you have vision. Gotta love the Overtons for that!"}
{"text":"Key lime cheesecake: I guess the tartness of the key lime just doesn't complement the flavors of the original cheesecake mix well, but the crust alone was amazing.

Brownie sundae: Don't come to THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY for a brownie sundae. The brownie was kind of hard and not very chewy and didn't have a very nice smooth chocolate flavor.

Chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake: I couldn't taste the cookie dough at all, it was just like eating the original cheesecake that accidentally had bland cookie dough thrown in and the oreo crust was too bitter for my liking."}
{"text":"Best waiter ever! Montice provided impeccable service, with a couple of laughs on the side. He was an expert on the menu, and gave us his honest opinion on the items we asked about. We'll definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was just okay.  Weird bowl of fruit though. Really small cut on the fruit and it had a weird taste. 

Service was also slow today. It took 45 minutes to get eggs, toast and fruit?

They have good dinners here but I'm going back to MiMi's or Black Bear Diner for breakfast."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I like this restaurant chain. I feel it has pretty decent food and portions for the money you pay. Now getting down to the issue I usually go the the Beachwood OH location however its now 15 miles farther from where I live since moving to strongsville. 
This visit was my second outing at the Crocker Park location and  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  The taste was subpar, the sauce tasted like under ripe tomatoes and salt.  The noodles themselves were firm and starchy. The service was good, our server was ever present and we did have to wait long for drinks etc. I suggest if you are in the area and can get to either restaurant head to the Beachwood location."}
{"text":"Totally dissapointed. After hearing everyone e ant on and on about the cheesecake factory, i decided to try it out with my girlfriend. She got the fish tacos and i got the hamburger and fries. Both dishes were very dry and tasteless. But that is what you can expect with pre made food kept in the freezer. Then we decided to try the cheesecake. After all, its in the name. The cake was totally frozen and the truffle was like a rock. They hould atleast take the time to make decent cheesecake. I wouldnt mind the wait. Overall, i will not be returning."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour to sit but Cheesecake Factory is always amazing. So many choices and the dessert is wonderful. My complaint is that the service can be slow because of the high volume of people coming in!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone has given this place low marks.  They have good drinks, a huge menu with plenty of variety and the meals Ive had have always been good, large portions to boot.  Cheesecake is excellent as well.  For a chain restaurant its definitely worthy of four stars and as crowded as it gets on the weekends should tell you the same."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 10 different occasions in the past 2-3 years. I've tried a variety of things, the meatloaf dinner (yum), chicken & biscuit dinner (blah- won't order again, plus the biscuit was a rock), the brunch French toast is a favorite of mine ( yum, it's usually when we go visit), California omelet (on our most recent visit... The avocado was actually guacamole, no cheese on top- only inside- which didn't seem like much at all & I had ordered extra- so that was disappointing. The inside not mixed well, as I went through the omelet, I'd go from one ingredient to another.. Also they don't cut up the cherry tomatoes & I cut into one on my 1st bite into the omelet where a cherry tomato happened to be, which burst and squirted my face & eye, which was painful!) 

So overall, I'm not super impressed with this place. It's ok.

Dessert to-go or pick-up is good. We love the carrot cake, I've ordered a whole one before. For my husbands 30th birthday. Yum!
Also can't wait for the pumpkin cheesecake."}

The food was good as always and service was good for being so busy but when the girl asked to bag up my food I was like ok.... I wish I would have done it myself... I gave her a plate with 1.5 sandwich and full fries and ketchup and ranch... I look at my to go food once I got back to work and all I had was 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 fries... I had weightloss surgery so I cant eat a lot at 1 time but if im gonna pay full price for meals I want my WHOLE meal I didn't eat to go.... SUPER unhappy with CCF today!! Shame on the waitress!!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory in Madison Wi.... stay clear. I happen to love the franchise but tonight I had the worst, most racist experience ever. I've always thought Cheesecake Factory was a family restaurant, which is why I didn't hesitate to bring my daughter in this evening with friends and family to celebrate her 10th Birthday. Well, where do I start?! We were seated by a party of 3 that complained from the time we sat down, rolling their eyes saying rude shit about kids, never asking to be moved. Mind you, we're in a family restaurant with a party of 10. I hear the rude ass waitress apologizing to the party while pointing, whispering and making faces at the kids. Next the manager comes over and proceeds to comp their entire meal. So as he's walking away, we say \"excuse me, the is a family restaurant right?\" The music is blaring and the voice level is average... he says of course we are, or waitstaff just should have done a better job at putting them in a more private area. A private area in a public restaurant?! How so? So I ask, will our meals be comped as well for us being seated by a very rude, racist party that constantly gave our children dirty looks and whispered loud enough that they too were uncomfortable? Of course not... so again, why are they being comped for choosing to go to a public restaurant and dining amongst the public? Our waitress dropped our drinks... were we accommodated in any way? So I'm still looking for the answer, is this a family restaurant?!  We're here spending hundreds of dollars and being treated like we marched past the whites only sign. Never will I ever patronize this place again. I will be contacting regional managers, CEO's and whomever else. I also intend on speaking with my attorney tomorrow. I'm disgusted and anyone with a family should take their money elsewhere and I intend on making everyone that I know"}

Appetizers were okay but when it came to my Pear and Endive salad, I have to say it was less than mediocre. I maybe ate 1/3 of it because that's all the endive/fresh greens that were in it. The rest was iceberg and I don't find that appetizing. Especially when I expect endive in a pear and endive salad. 

However, the white chocolate truffle cheesecake slice was fantastic."}
{"text":"Everything started off very good. Greeted quickly by the female bartender working, and drinks and food were served in a timely manner. 

We ordered Thai lettuce wraps and fire roasted artichoke, and both were amazing. Couldn't of been happier with our decisions. 

What bothered me was not being offered another drink well after I was done with my first and about to take my last bite of dinner, so I wasn't really in the mood to order another one anymore. Next, I looked at my bill and was charged for the more expensive of the two wines when I had asked just for the house wine which would be the cheapest of the two at most places, so I was kind of disappointed that she decided to just give and charge me what she wanted. It was only $2 more and the wine was actually very good, so I didn't mention it since I had finished the wine, if I had ordered another, maybe I would have brought it up. 

Female bartender leaves and now left with the male who was working the well the majority of the time we were there. He's very nice and checks to see if we want dessert. I tell him I'm going to look, and decide to just order espressos for my fiancé and myself. Five minutes go by after ordering and I excuse myself to the bathroom. I come back and still no espressos, and he says they are being checked on... Now well over 15 minutes, he says they are being checked on.. Comes back to tell us they aren't ready... 25 minutes go by.... Tells us again they aren't ready but ensures us that they are coming. I'm over the espressos. I ask him to cancel and rering my card without them. I go outside and 5 minutes later my fiancé tells me they are there. I appreciate getting them being taken off but I honestly didn't want them anymore and they were not very hot, and not offered any sugar or spoon for the drinks. It wasn't the bartenders fault but just disappointed in 30 minute espressos... And pretty upset that it took longer to get the espressos than the time it took to order and eat our dinner...

My fiancé said the manager came over and apologized for the espresso while I was outside, and had removed them from our bill, but didn't seem to want to make up for taking so long on what should of been a quick after dinner drink.."}
{"text":"Was there for my birthday yesterday, but it's not the first time I had been there. The service was excellent this evening, but I think that was because we got there at 5:30, just before the dinner rush hit. Our meals were brought to us in a very timely manner, and they even accommodated a picky child. I'm not sure why it says it's not good for kids, as the place was full of them and they have a kids menu.
 
The servings are always way more than you need. I had the Cobb Salad and brought most of it home. Had the calamari as an appetizer and absolutely loved it. And of course I needed a piece of vanilla bean cheesecake, after all it was my birthday. :-)  I definitely recommend going but try to plan a down time or just before or after a normal lunch or dinner rush."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is definitely the best part of this place. The food is average fare, and there are so many things to choose from it's a bit overwhelming. VERY over-priced too. Had to laugh at their new \"skinylicious\" menu. I mean, it's good they have one, but it still made me giggle. Who goes to Cheesecake Factory to watch their calorie intake?  I had a pomegranate mojito that was wonderful. The steak and salmon combo was also good, but they give you a half-gallon tub of mashed potatoes and three- yes THREE- asparagus spears. What's wrong with that picture?  Our waitress Samantha, however, was awesome! So if you get her you'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"They have an extensive menu and the food is good.  The bad service, though, sinks this restaurant.   It's relegated to a carry-out option only.

I've been to a number of locations around the country and they're usually good and finally decided to try this one in our back yard during a weekday to celebrate my birthday. 

The service was very slow, despite being fairly empty.  The server couldn't care less that it was my birthday.  Didn't bring a cheesecake menu when asked and didn't bring a candle or anything.   We could hear and see other birthday celebrations at other tables.  This server just didn't seem to like us as she chatted up other tables with her life story while ignoring us sing 'Happy Birthday.'  We even asked afterwards about getting anything complimentary or a candle and got a nonsense answer about only with other desserts.  If not for a birthday, we wouldn't be there and certainly wouldn't order dessert.   
It was really a let-down.

I called the manager later, who was equally uninterested in making anything right.  She said she'd talk to the server about their policy and hoped we'd come in for future birthdays.   Absolutely NOT! 
There are so many better options nearby."}
{"text":"This is my first time to the Canada Location but I've been to the US ones many times. Wait was acceptable on Thursday 5pm and service was ok. However the place is really a mess with employees running around. There are lots of people work there but they looked so miserable what they need to do. I asked for the tropical ice tea unsweetened because that's the one US has. My server gave me a sweeten black tea. When I asked why he said the Canadian store has no tropical unsweetened tea. I got  the shrimp scampi and it was not even hot from kitchen. It was probably warmer than cold dish so it was a big disappointment. Will not come again for sure. RH cafe or joey are way better if you go to Yorkdale."}
{"text":"I went here to eat and we try'd explaining what we wanted to order and instead of canceling the order and coming back to ask what we wanted or trying to accommodate with us with what she could. She decided to put in our order without even coming back and asking. Then got mad/ laughed at us and didn't give us any type of respect. Then when they took it off our recite and gave us a free cheese cake she decided to put it down with an attitude and laugh and walk away. Then she had her fellow  employee tell us to have a good day because it's beautiful as she is laughing swiping my card. The over all disrespect was ridiculous. Will never go back again after that."}
{"text":"I ordered off the \"Skinnylicious\" menu.  Not really because I'm trying to watch my weight, but because I can't eat cheese and one of the only pastas without cheese was on that menu.  I also ordered the side house salad, which was decent, but drenched with too much salad dressing and the tomatoes was not a \"good\" ripe tomato.  I also ordered the chicken rigatoni pasta in red sauce with basil.  Nothing too amazing, I could definitely cook something just as delicious at home.  So I enjoyed the food overall, but found it all a bit overpriced.

The nice thing is that even on a Friday night they will take reservations for large groups."}
{"text":"All hail the Cheesecake Factory at Caesar's!  We were having a bad day, stopped here for lunch, and it was like the sky opened and sunlight began to stream on our faces.  The air was sweeter, the weather nicer, all of humanity was in love with us.  Okay, it wasn't that extreme, but Cheesecake Factory really knows how to make you feel at home.  

Our server, Gabby, was so great.  The strawberry lemonade is like a drug, that's how delicious it is.  Fresh-made guacomole and warm chips!  Super lunch specials.  I wish I was there now.  And do I even need to mention the cheesecake?  They have a new 30th Anniversary cake -- chocolate fudge cake and the original cheesecake together.  So good."}
{"text":"Came in on a great night. We were sat in about 15 minutes. 

Our server Jeremy was a very skilled server. We were sitting very close to all of his tables which had request after request. The other tables aside he quickly got our drinks and bread. (We were looking to go to a movie but gave up.)

We were in a hurry and he got us our appetizer in record time. Jeremy had our entrees out moments after our appetizer was cleared. The food was exceptional and just the right temperature. 

We had cheesecakes out and check signed forty minutes after we sat. Jeremy apologized for the wait. It was so fast and so attentive. We looked at the time and Jeremy fed us well, with enough time to finish date night with a movie. Great work Jeremy, you made our CF visit the best."}
{"text":"As expected, this restaurant nearly never fails at delivering not only great food but amazing service from the lady that waited on us. 
I definitely will keep this place in mind for those \"special... but not THAT special\" type of nights"}
{"text":"They let us dine with our own premade 50/50 lemon aid + Tequila; only in Vegas! If you sit near the mall, the never ending mechanical play can get annoying."}
{"text":"I could not describe this better than Chad in an earlier review. I thought I walked into the Belagio Casino in Vegas. I knew it was going to be expensive when I saw the 40 ft high ceilings. Someone has to pay for all this air. 

The noise level is amazing. I could barely hear the bartender when I ordered a drink. As I sat there sipping on a glass of wine I noticed massive portions of food being served. I saw salads that could feed a village in Afghanistan.

What is with the massive portions? I ordered an Angus burger that had to be 3/4lb to 1 lb,  loaded with onions and mushrooms. The place is also pricey but then............

It finally hit me. When you go to the Cheesecake factory you order an entree you want to eat at your next two meals. So you really need to focus on which items are a good for reheating  and taste good as leftovers.

By spreading the meal over two or three meals makes the high prices seem very reasonable. So this is why people wait 45 minutes to 2 hours to eat at the Cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory is the definition of corporate american food. But here at least they do a very good job. Very diverse menu with many interesting things to order and try. Usually when a restaurant has 20 different types of food none of them are good. Of course they have great cheesecakes and other desserts. A great place for a large gathering for a party. This staff is well trained very nice and very helpful. They also have a nice happy hour in the bar area. I guess these are some reasons I keep going back."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch with my family to celebrate my son's 5th birthday and the staff went above and beyond to make my son feel special. He left with a smile on his face and a new stuffed animal the server game him. The food is always great and their customer service was top notch."}
{"text":"Although our sever did inform us that this was one of the newer locations, I believe that the host stand could use a little work on customer service. My family and I were not asked and didn't feel as though we had an option on whether or not we wanted to sit on the patio, but we tried to make it work. We ended up asking for a different table on the patio and I completely understand having to deal with picky guests as I too work in the restaurant business, but if we had been offered the patio from the beginning we would have politely declined.

Our server Skyler was AWESOME though. He had all the answers to the questions we had about the menu. He never looked bored or like he wanted us to hurry up. He was very attentive and we never had to ask for refills. In the end, I would say we were very well taken care of by Skyler."}
{"text":"Wait was 75 mins. Saturday night around 6 pm. We shopped and came back and were seated promptly.

I enjoyed everything about my meal.  Except they rang out of bang bang.  My favorite dish.  I had to settle for the southwestern salad.  So everything here is served in huge portions.  I guess I get what I'm paying for because it justifies the price on all the menu items.

Server was as good as it gets.  Greeted us as soon as we were seated and took care of us no problems.  He did a great job.  If I had any issue I had to ask for a drink refill.  Not really a big deal.

Overall I was pleased.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in for a quick dinner, before getting back to Christmas shopping. This was 4:30, Saturday the 9th of December. We were seated right away, and our server was Joe. Very pleasant guy, offered the wife 3 suggestions and took our order right away. Our food was on the table within 10 minutes! Amaze-balls!!!! The Greek salad was very good, and the wife had the Cuban egg rolls(?), which she enjoyed very much. 
Kudos to Joe for the very fine service and customer service!"}
{"text":"Love the cheesecake!!!  Fatboy in the house. Time to eat the cheesecake. Mmmm... I am in heaven"}
{"text":"Woohoo gluten free people. Cheesecake Factory loves us!! There are so many many chooses for you here. So please don't get scared and walk away... Look at the options.  Got one down the street so i know I can make a to go order and come and pick something good to enjoy at my house.1/2 of my pasta was cooked the other half was under cooked.  Shrimp tasted not cooked all the way. And I have always been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. But idk I am just saying. How do you have a huge Resturant and you only have two small tiny stalls in the bathrooms.  Really???? I think bathrooms need to be upgraded. 
Our waitress was helpful when I went to tell her about my meal so she told the manager and he is suppose to come over and talk to me about. The manager was awesome and comped my meal. Wanted to give me another one. But I am full and am not wanting to eat anything else for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever visited. Bathrooms were filthy. I asked one of the hostesses to please send someone to clean them and she said they were just cleaned!  Although the waiters were friendly, He never did get my drink order correct. I finally just drank what he brought me. Food service was slow. Except for the waiter, the rest of the staff I encountered was rude."}
{"text":"cheesecake here is divine. Went with a group of seven after a movie one night and the service was excellent. We did not wait long to be seated.  Love the original cheesecake. We ordered a whole one with coffee. Server Jeanette was amazing."}
{"text":"This one is absolutely amazing!! Buffalo blaats amd lettuce wraps. Killer lunch with my love"}
{"text":"I love Happy Hour here! The buffalo blasts are easily 2 different meals for me and a definite craving.  I haven't once had bad service in the years they have been open, many of the employees are the same so they must be doing something right.  I can never pick a cheesecake because all of them are so good!  I'm also a sucker for their Cesar Salad it's absolutely refreshing!"}
{"text":"The South Side Cheesecake Factory is far worse than others.

If you've ever been to Cheesecake Factory before, then you know what to expect:  a novel-sized menu, portions that could feed 3-4 people, and enough calories for one sitting, that most starving Haitians don't consume in a month.  

That being said - my boyfriend and I know exactly what to expect; therefore, when we dine there, we try to cater to our own unique eating habits.  My boyfriend and I always go with the intention of splitting appetizers, because that's enough food in itself to satiate us.  We ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (which comes on a PLATTER - meaning its ENORMOUS), the Chicken Pot Sticker Dumplings, and Stuffed Mushrooms (from the \"small snacks\" menu, but even it being a \"small snack\" there were still 9 stuffed mushrooms).  

Now I normally don't like to give a bad review of the place, based solely on the performance of the server.  I was once a server myself, for a good 12 years, and I know they are human, they have a butt load of sidework, and sometimes find themselves in the \"weeds\" when the crowd all rushes in at once.  I understand all of this and try not to let it effect the rest of my dining experience when we dine on a night like this.  However, when a server - or MULTIPLE servers on different occasions, are consistently rude and inattentive because we choose to ONLY order appetizers, is unacceptable.  And we have only experienced this attitude at the South Side location. 

The moment we said we were \"just ordering a few appetizers\", her body language and facial expression could have spelled out a symphony of harmonious disappointment and irritation.  Little did she know how low-maintenance/high-tippers we normally are.  I ordered decaf coffee and a water, my boyfriend ordered a hot tea and a water - but never once, not even after she brought our appetizers, did we ever see a glass of water.  I guess decaf coffee is supposed to be a delicate complement to Chicken Pot Stickers.   

Plus - THE RACKET!!!!  All of the servers and the bussers are extremely clumsy with taking away dishes, and re-setting tables.  I think we heard about 5 dishes crack the 45 minutes we were there. The entire night, my boyfriend and I had to keep asking each other to repeat ourselves, because of all the dishes and utensils clanking every single second we sat there.  Basically, in restaurant talk - the FOH might as well have not existed because it was as loud as the BOH or HOH (the kitchen for normal speaking folk).  

I know this is a corporate juggernaut, and I do know what I should expect upon going in one.  This place is definitely sub-par of it's corporate standards.  I'll stick with McKnight Rd if we ever venture for quick apps again."}

{"text":"My one student wrote her review for YELP! Club about Cheesecake Factory, so this is actually Fiorella's review (6th grade student):

My experience at Cheesecake Factory was very delightful. The service was excellent because our server Angelo was kind and patient when we were ordering. The cleanliness was very good considering the amount of time the servers have to clean the table, since there are so many customers. The time we had to wait to be seated was understandable because Cheesecake Factory is always crowded. Overall my experience was very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Must-do update...

After speaking with a representative of the Cheesecake Factory corporate office, I opted to give another location a shot. Checking out the franchise on Rampart in Summerlin, I was pleasantly surprised. We took my lovely mother in law, who is as notoriously hard to please as my beautiful wife and a really good time was had by all. Impeccable service and the entrees arrived as expected and quite good. Trust me when I say that the flavor profile the manager was going for at the Outlet Shops location was NOT what was served in Summerlin. Night and day, really. 

I'm not saying to patronize one location over any other and I'm not saying I'll be rushing back to another Cheesecake Factory, but I'm glad corporate talked me into a return visit because if all I knew was the sloppy service and the slop on the plate at the Outlet Shops I'd do whatever I could to steer y'all clear.  That run on sentence notwithstanding, second chances can be a good thing."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at The CheeseCake Factory and I can probably tell you it was the worst experience ever; from the nasty floors to the ROACH crawling along OUR the table - REALLY!! The waiter did his best to catch the Roach without success. The waitress apologizes for the floor and the roach. Eventually the manager came over and offered to waive our dessert that we didn't even order. So he wanted us to pay more money for an subpar experience. I can see why this restaurant has three start rating. The restaurant is subpar, the floors are always dirty with food from the last guest and now they have a roach issue and we weren't even compensated correctly for our troubles or just to simply make it as right as possible. For this reason we will probably never return although we live 2 minutes away."}
{"text":"If you want great food and hearty portions this is the place for you!!!!!! Have gone here for my bday for the last 5 Years An they give u a nice slice of cheesecake for free!! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat the service is great and pleasant. Always look forward to come here."}
{"text":"Really great food however we were greeted by a strange waitress who started by telling us \" whatever you do, don't order lots of food\"....yes the serving sizes are big but never had I been pre-warned about ordering too much food before lol, great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of amazing restaurants in Vegas but we always end up coming here and sometimes more than once. The service and food is always consistent and always great no matter which place it is. There's an aquarium right in front of it so it's not boring while you wait and sometimes there are divers in there which is pretty cool. 

We had the pasta with meat sauce, steaks and a mushroom pasta which were all amazing. I would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Cheesecake Factory I have been to! For some reason the food doesn't taste like any other cheesecake factories! The chicken was not cooked and the food was not too warm. I order pasta and it was like they brought me soup. The sauce did not stick to the pasta at all just gross"}
{"text":"Went with two friends today after a baseball tournament got rained out, it was around 10:30 on a Saturday morning. 

The place was busy but definitely not packed, we were given a buzzer and told the wait was around 15 minutes. When our buzzer finally went off we were told to wait again in a line til our name was called, what was the point of taking the buzzer then??? 

We ordered the following: 
1. Taquitos - these were surprisingly delicious 
2. Club sandwich - also good, but it's not a complicated dish 
3. Chicken and waffle Benedict - the waffle was soggy, and the hollandaise was just cream. There was no element of citrus or extraordinary flavour 
4. Monte Christo - the bread was soggy ( I mean wet and heavy), the inside was fine I guess, some parts had HUGE slices of omelette while others had none. One section of sandwich had no bottom bread. 

Overall the food wasn't amazing and we were full because the portions are very \"American\" sized but not satisfied - I think next time we will  not choose any of the brunch items 

I got a piece of turtle cheesecake to bring home since I was too full to try it there, it was good but a little expensive for $10 a slice. 

The service is alright, our waitress showed up every so often to check on us or bring us something but nothing outstanding. 

I'd go back for lunch or dinner maybe. I've eaten at a few in the states and the pasta and mains are good, so will probably try that."}
{"text":"Went here today craving a salad. I was so surprised at the excellent service and fresh food for a chain restaurant- my only complaints- 1- I got a bowl of soup while my husband got a cup- volume wise they were the same- price wise $2 difference 2-the appetizer kale salad $595 and the entree salad $995- also same size 
However our waitress was excellent! She vm brought us banana slices for the baby! Thanks for awesome service!"}
{"text":"Where do I even start. Basically this location STOLE a $100 dollar gift card from us.
Came here to eat for a family members birthday on Tuesday January 9th 2018.
Our bill came to a total of $163.46 
We wanted to pay with the 100 dollar gift card and the 63 dollars with our debit card. But the next day we realized they had charged our debit card the total $163.46 AND kept our 100 dollar gift card as well!! 
The next day we spoke to a manger by the name of Melanie who told us she would mail a new gift card. A WEEK later we went back because no gift card had arrived and spoke to Joel, left our contact information and he said he would get back to us within 24 hours. 
It is now FEBRUARY 26th and I haven't heard from anyone! We are so frustrated and aren't receiving much cooperation or empathy. So diapo



*UPDATE* I emailed customer service like I was asked to in the reply from Cheesecake Factory to my original review. It is now Wednesday MARCH 21st and I have yet to hear anything back?? This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have eaten @ this front location of Biltmore Fashion Park and each time it has been a positive experience.  This type of restaurant not only serves their signature cheesecakes with various flavors and toppings, it also serves typical lunch food (BLT sandwich w/ fries, appetizers) and Happy Hour.  It's more of a grown-up family and friends type of place moreso than families with kids.  There is also a patio to sit out and enjoy (loud) company and tolerant weather ;)  The servers are professional and happy to take your cameras/phones to snap pictures as per your request (so that the restaurant backdrop can show ;) ).  The atmospheric lights are dim with the restrooms even more dim.  The ambiance and room temperature are at a comfortable level and while it's casual dining, it's better to put on something nice being this is Biltmore and the restaurant chain started out in Beverly Hills, California.  That is only if you want to fit in.  I usually come here to enjoy original-flavored scrumptious cheesecake.  Have tea with it-  it's a plus for your palette ;)  Even the plain cheesecake is that filling so eating a lunch with it could cause my stomach to explode ;)  There is a bakery in front if you'd like to purchase their cheesecakes.  Thanks!  BTW, I love the revolving entry door :)"}
{"text":"What can I say about Cheesecake Factory... We have been to this location a few times over the years. Sometimes they are very busy and there is a wait. 
I enjoy sitting out front and just watching the fish in the HUGE aquarium it is amazing and fun to pass the time while you wait.
We have never had a bad experience, the food is always very good, Portions are good.
This is one of those places if your in Caesars Palace you just want to eat at because you know the food is good.
I hate trying new places and getting ripped off! Here you never feel like your ripped off. You may go home with some of your food if you aren't real hungry.
Over all we Highly recommend this place, you can not go wrong eating here!!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is a safe chain restaurant to go to for affordable yet ample portioned meals. We came here on a Thursday night. Our server Loni was excellent. She was quite attentive to us.

However, the bread she initially brought us was burned and really hard. Then, more bread came but it was cold. The better Cheesecake Factory restaurants normally toast the bread on the spot so that when the customer eats it, it is warm and soft, not cold and burned.

I ordered from the special menu (the separate insert) where they have the chef's specialty items for that particular restaurant. I ordered the salmon with spinach and angel hair pasta. The salmon was excellent. However, their sauce was extremely creamy and oily. It was very overwhelming. If the sauce was replaced with let's say marinara sauce, it would have been perfect. So, I ended up eating all the spinach and salmon only and left the sauce and angel hair pasta alone."}
{"text":"I sooo wanted to dislike this place.  It just seemed kind of silly when I heard of people waiting two hours to eat at what I thought was essentially a TGIF.  I first ate here about ten years ago in Vegas and I remember not being terribly impressed.  And, this was at the time when I thought the ground round was formal dining.  That being the case I was sure I would be disappointed this time.  I had lunch here on Monday afternoon with a friend.  It was around 230 PM and it was on a Monday so they weren't that busy.  The space itself is very nice.  It's attached to Ross Park Mall and is very big with a large open air environment.  The booths are spacious and the place feels clean and has a lot of dark wood.  As soon as we entered we were greated with a big smile and a friendly host.  We were seated at a good booth and the server arrived promptly.  They had a fun selection of iced teas and I think I had the passion fruit iced tea, which was \"unsweetened\" but I didn't believe it needed any additional sugar.  I ordered a black bean soup that was the special.  It was about average and the consistency for me was a little too mushed.  The sour cream on top was a good amount without being overwhelming.  They had a huge menu which is always kind of scary because who can do so many things so well.  I ordered a \"navajo\" chicken sandwich.  The reason I wanted to try it is because the bun was native american fry bread.  My friend ordered a burrito.  The navajo sandwich was delicious.  The fry bread was light and airy and perfect for the sandwich, which was chicken breast and avocado mostly.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry.  The avocado was perfect.  I often order avocado and it's not ripe enough.  The fries were forgettable.  Lisa's burrito was as big as my head.  It was okay.  Definitely a very americanized burrito relying more on heavy sauces and cheese than distinctive ingredients.  I'm not a dessert person, but she ordered the oreo cheesecake (I think?).  It was good, but not as good as I would expect from the \"CHEESECAKE\" factory.  The service continued to be perfect.  I was really impressed with the staff here.  This place is definitely better than TG McFunsteres... But, probably still not worth a two hour wait."}
{"text":"Service was not so great and my chicken tasted really off and almost like fish... Also waited about 30 minutes for our check we decided to not order any cheesecake since our server took forever to do anything... Very disappointed. What happened to the cheesecake factory i knew and loved?"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and realized I never wrote a review. Always a great experience!

Staff is always friendly, upbeat, and helpful with suggestions (and not always suggesting the most expensive items either). Had to stop the last server from refilling my water glass. It was never less than half full.

Big portions, very delicious, and great desserts...or is that an obvious comment? They lose a star 'cause it's a bit on the pricy side even with big servings.

If they had Wi-Fi available in the bar area, I could work while enjoying an adult beverage and more."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Great value for your dollar! Enough food per serving to share with lots left over to take home. Cheese cake was excellent! We came here on a Tuesday at 5:00 pm no lineup we got seated right way! Our servers as very attentive and made sure we were looked after well!"}
{"text":"It's a Cheesecake Factory, so you really can't ask for anything more.  I do like that they have entire \"skinny\" menu that offers healthier food and drink options."}
{"text":"Was a Wednesday night, got sat within seconds. Just went for dessert. Tiramisu....  bomb."}
{"text":"We love getting curbside from here. Probably do so once a week. Tonight we ordered steak and meatloaf..both the same price. The meatloaf had a ton of mashed potatoes and the steak probably had 1.5 Tablespoons of mashed potatoes spread out as thin as they could get it. I'm not sure the cooks reasoning behind this but it is absolutely absurd. Giving two stars because the taste of the food did not disappoint. However, do not order steak if you're looking for a portion for an adult..maybe a toddler would be happy."}
{"text":"Normally I would never pick to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, ever, but a co-worker picked it for a work function, so off we went. 

There were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first. 

I have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue. 

The other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. 

Well, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless. 

As for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again. I know I won't be missing much."}
{"text":"Some people might scoff at me for liking Cheesecake factory. Whatever floats your boat. There's only two items on the menu that keeps me coming back here. BUFFALO BLAAAAAAASTS. What is that? What was in there? Buffalo marinated chicken with cheese inside of fried wonton wrappers. Do not underestimate these fried wonton wrappers...sounds strange, but you won't even know that they're wonton wrappers while you're eating them. The blue cheese sauce and buffalo sauce on the side is AWESOOOOOOOOOME. 

My other fave item is their Godiva brownie sundae. This will be sure to hit the spot if you're craving major sweets. 

Let's not forget the complimentary brown and sourdough bread. ME LOOOOOVES!!! 

Service was on point. Location is nice, but interior is much smaller than other Cheesecakes I've gone to. 

I\"ll be back to stuff my face with some more buffalo blasts...after I manage to get a workout aka walk 1 mile."}
{"text":"Food was great . Original waitress was great . Food runner who dropped off food had a TERRIBLE attitude . The wrong item was brought out and when we were trying to explain to her that's not what we ordered she began to question if we told our waitress the correct thing \" and pretty much sighed and rolled her eyes with irritation. Spoke to a manager immediately . Hopefully this was dealt with worst customer service i ever experienced here."}
{"text":"This was the least favorite of all the Cheesecake Factory's that I have eaten the service was okay the food was not as tasty for some reason as it is by the one by Summerlin. I had a margarita margarita drink that was not that strong at all. maybe I'm being a little too hard but I don't know it just didn't taste like the Cheesecake Factory that I'm used to. I did like the outside seating that was kind of cool."}
{"text":"I been here multiple times. And the service is not that great (so do not expect much). Not much of a line up lately. But my recent visit, my appetizer is uncooked, they served me a wrong order. Despite of the manager coming to my table and apologizing, I am still unsatisfied with overall experience. Hopefully, they will change the service and live up to their standards."}
{"text":"The wait is well worth it. 

The meals are large, very flavourful and sometimes is enough to take home. 

The main attraction is the cheese cake. So many to choose from!!

If you go just for the desert, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.   The bread they brought out was hard and burnt.   Ordered nachos with spicy chicken -  the chips were burnt  and chicken was tasteless.   Also ordered the meatballs with cheese bread and ricotta - it was just ok.   The cheesecake was the only good thing.   Service was good."}
{"text":"Honestly have always had good experiences here. John and the bartender with the ponytail (sorry I never caught your name!) are so amazing! I come in every once in a while and it doesn't matter how far between I make my visits, both of these guys always remember me. Their customer service is exquisite and this is what makes me come back. 

Not to mention the food at Cheesecake is always amazing and you get a healthy proportion of food. This is my favorite place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I almost never write reviews for corporate franchise chain restaurants, but every Cheesecake Factory I've been too has been shockingly good.  It's roughly the same price as an Applebee's or Olive Garden, but you get a much better experience for your money.

Consistent, freshly prepared dishes, with intense flavors and comically large portions.

Pleasant decor and atmosphere.  Very friendly and attentive staff.  Despite their name, it's a great place to come even if you don't like cheesecake.  It's got an endless menu with over 100 options, for every palette and preference.

Some companies are big, because they're big.  Other's are big, because they deserve to be.  Treat yourself to a Cadillac at Chevy prices.  I think you get a better experience for the money here, than any other large chain out there."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at Cheesecake Factory at other locations and had a much better experience, so here we go....We arrive around 12ish on a sunday, which was a horrible time at the South Park mall, dont do it, unless U are jus that bored.  We waited approx 1hr, didnt leave because we knew all the other restaurants would have the same wait time. Once we were seated it went all down hill from there. We didnt get a \"hey how are U\" nor good afternoon, The waitress Whitney K. acted as if we were a bother the whole time. I ordered the veggie appetizer, had to ask for sauce, then I ordered the fish and chips-  asked her if I could substitute the the cole slaw, she said \"no its a Garnish and we cant do that\". She never asked if I wanted to maybe pay extra for a salad or maybe another item. I had to ask for vinegar for my fish, not really understanding at this point why I didnt jus pay and leave. I was so done so no matter what she said or did I wasnt hearing it. Next I asked for the manager, he proceeded to listen and apologize. 

The food really wasnt good after all this mishap, we paid and I left no Tip, which I have never done, this could have been my child. But I feel U should give 100% at work at all times, if not GO home, plenty of people need a job. Im not always happy at work either but I make sure I dont reflect this in my service to the public. Once a manager or owner of a business has mastered this with there employees U will have happy customers who will wait and return. I went to Olive Garden the next day, and the staff were all 100% my waiter earned the 20% I left him. I never asked for anything, he was very professional and they were busy on Memorial Day!!

Now this tops it off, before leaving I saw Miss Whitney show my receipt to the manager, I left no TIP, she made a weird face to him....really do U expect me to leave my hard earned money to someone who was rude to my family???  I wont return, my coins will B spent elsewhere....ENUFFSAID"}
{"text":"(start rant)
I don't like reviewing chain restaurants b/c well.... they're chains.  And the pro's / con's of a chain typically persist from restaurant to restaurant.  This review is no different.

Cheesecake Factory has decent food w/ large portions.  There's something for everyone on the menu.  Except those watching their figure.  If you've never seen their nutritional information before and aren't in the mood to cry, stop reading.  For everyone else, read on.

**********
Let's start with a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer to split!  Oh wait, that's 1270 calories?  With 38 grams of saturated fat?  and 2270 mg of sodium?  Hmm, let's skip that and grab our entrees.

I hear their Chicken Madeira is pretty tasty!  Oh hi there 1420 calories, 44 grams of saturated fat and over 2000 mg of sodium!  How about some pasta?  I hear their Bistro Shrimp pasta is legit!  Oh wait, it's 2290 calories and has 73 grams of saturated fat...  I guess I'll get some healthy seafood instead...  That miso salmon sounds good!  And so does the 1670 calories that come with it, along with its 39 grams of saturated fat and over a day's worth of sodium!  (note: none of these figures include any sides: add a mashed potatoes and you get an additional 560 calories)

I think I'll stick with a salad...  how about the grilled chicken tostada salad?  The chicken is grilled so it HAS to be healthy right?  If 1130 calories with 2150 mg of sodium is healthy, then I guess so...  (here's a note of comparison: two Big Macs actually has less calories and sodium than this salad.)

Add any slice of cheesecake and you have over a day's worth of calories and fat and sodium (all cheesecakes have at least 300 mg of sodium and some specialty desserts have over 1000 mg)
**********

I don't mind calorie laden food, but I'd rather save my calories for tastier food elsewhere.  Yes restaurant food is typically bad for you, but if I'm dropping $20-$30 for dinner at a place and it's going to be bad for me, the food better be delicious, and taking reservations might be nice too.  Since Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations and the food isn't all that great, I feel no remorse whenever I pass by Cheesecake Factory in lieu of other restaurants.
(end rant)

Okay Cheesecake Factory isn't the spawn of the devil as I had put it out to be, and it's not too bad for larger parties with picky eaters.  And it's not like I'm going to cry if I were to go back again and again, it just wouldn't be my first choice for dinner.... or second, or third, or fourth or fifth...

Sorry ladies; you better pick somewhere else to go for that girl's night out if you want that killer beach bod in time for summer."}
{"text":"I recently tackled an ambitious multi-course dinner here, which was both stomach filling and palate pleasing.  

For starters, I began with Crispy Fried Cheese, which was composed of a nice mix of both Mozzarella and Fontina Cheeses.  Following close behind were pan-fried Chicken Pot Stickers, which were satisfying doused in a Ginger & Soy Dipping Sauce, and SkinnyLicious Shrimp Summer Rolls that were wrapped in Rice Paper along with asparagus and Shitake Mushrooms.  The cold, fairly wide (not particularly skinny) rolls were lip-smacking good dipped in  either a provided Chili Dip or Peanut Dip. 

Next a large cup of spicy Tortilla Soup that would be labeled a \"bowl\" most everywhere else contained a pleasant but unusual concoction of rice- and corn-filled enchilada-flavored liquid.  Complimentary Brown Bread was excellent.

Although by this time more food was hardly necessary, a packed California Cheesesteak that was filled with thinly sliced grilled steak, onions, peppers, and melted cheese, and covered with sauteed mushrooms inside a toasted Ciabatta Roll, was nicely done.  Accompanying French Fries were good, and the Cole Slaw that went with Diane's Fried Shrimp Platter was cool and creamy.  Obviously there was no further room for dessert, so it was forsworn.        

Delivery was late on Diane's ordered Root Beer.  Otherwise service was very attentive.  A California casual atmosphere well suited my choice of sandwich.  

XXXX-1/2 Overall!"}
{"text":"Service by John was outstanding, top notch server. Food was cooked as ordered with a delay, but it was Sunday morning breakfast after all. Will be returning many times with service like that."}
{"text":"Came here on boxing day around 9pm, it was just me and my significant other, we waited around 1 hour for a table which wasn't too bad since we were able to wall around the mall and shop while we waited (they give you a buzzer which notifies when a table is ready)

The vibe was not bad, enough room between the table and diners. I did not like how the cutlery was placed onto the tables without any napkins. I'm not sure how sanitary the tabletops are and would rather have cutlery at least placed on the dishes or napkins like an ordinary restaurant - it just looks and feels tacky and cheap. 

Our waiter lacked a little experience and didn't know much about the drinks menu. They were really friendly and nice though but they had to keep going back and forth to find out about some things on the menu (understandable as the restaurant just opened). Service was moderately fast.

One thing I didn't like was when they packed the food they did not pack the dressings/dipping sauce that came with the food.

Food was decent, not entirely the best. The cheesecake was good, really loved the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. The portion was huge too we had to take a few things to go. Everything was slightly pricer than average. 

Definitely nice to come on a date or once in awhile."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and tonight my husband and I wanted to celebrate our birthdays. I asked the host if she can give us a nice table because we were celebrating and I'm a big woman ok. When we walk to the table they gave us this dinky itty bitty table when I asked for a nice table not a child's table. Anyway she rolled her eyes at me and I walked out. You want super rude service go here"}
{"text":"I am giving this review a 4 star based on over all experience. We showed up around 8 and didn't get a seat for at least 35 min after they told us 20. That's fine because the place was packed and there was hardly any room to stand. When I got to my booth it looked nice at a glance but then I found left over lettuce and crumbs on my table not a big deal either except my clean silverware was left for me on this table uncovered. Anyways I've been here before so it's not a big deal to me anyways. Our server was this character named Sean. And he was extremely entertaining and did his job well. We were rly here for dessert so what we did was ordered 3 appetizers and then two wonderful cheesecakes. Yum love both of them. Anyways I'll be back hopefully when it's not too busy"}
{"text":"The wait was too long when it was not even busy. Finally got to sit down but had to wait for 15 minutes before a server even acknowledged our table. When the food came out they claimed the plate was hot but my food was only lukewarm. Today's visit was so not worth it."}
{"text":"Huge, overwhelming menu. I recommend ordering something off their Skinnylicious menu & then splurging on dessert. They have a decent number of gluten-free items on the menu, including one cheesecake option (flourless chocolate). I got the almond salmon salad, modified to be gf. I gotta say, it was pretty dang good with the Dijon & ranch mustard. Friendly service."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is such a mixed bag of good and bad. There's almost always a wait if you have a party larger than 2, even if the restaurant is empty. I don't know if they are understaffed or if there are tons many people visiting on a daily basis. Either way, call ahead if possible.

This particular location has a valet, but you can easily park around the mall and walk a couple minutes if you want to save a few bucks. Servers are friendly and attentive. Restaurant is nice, big, clean - kind of reminds me of a Vegas casino.

I really like the rye bread - it's soft and sweet. White bean hummus is a nice twist on classic hummus, although I think the accompanying bread was a bit stale. No biggie. I just wish I had ordered a different entree. I got the Chinese chicken salad, which is a stupid choice given their huge menu of American and European dishes. The salad tasted like the Asian chicken salad from Wendy's, but with a bunch of rice noodles on top. Sure, it's a big salad, but not worth the $14.50 I paid for it. Like I said, my own fault - order at your own risk!

The crispy chicken costoletta was actually good. Once again, big portion, and the chicken was really nice. Mashed potatoes seemed a bit tired, and the asparagus was nothing fancy. Still, it was good, and I wouldn't mind ordering it in the future.

I think the food here is good, not outstanding, and I do think it's overpriced. I wouldn't mind eating here again but it'll be awhile before I do."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of cheesecake factory anywhere in any state. I love the avocado eggrolls and their tiramisu cake.  They have happy hour on weekdays from 4-6 pm with plates for $5."}
{"text":"I cook for my husband almost every day. I do like to cook but when the process becomes a routine I need to take a break and go out some fine restaurant.

The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite food-places. I am dying to know the recipe of an appetizer \"Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes\". It is incredibly delicious. Sometimes I just get this dish and cheesecake on the dessert and I`m full. 

This place is really busy on weekends. You should be able to wait a twenty or thirty minutes but it is worth it. The waiter stuff is very friendly and they are serving very fast. 

I have never been dissapointed with the Cheesecake Factory and highly recommend this place:)"}
{"text":"I very much dislike how HUGE their menu is!!!!  My chicken caesar salad was okay.  My husband enjoyed the pork appetizers but hardly ate anything else not realizing that all of it was fried.  I suppose I will only be back for their cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Dude, I love this place, I don't care if it's a chain. The Brioche breakfast sandwich is super delicious. We also got hot crab dip which was also very tasty. Finished with some classic strawberry cheesecake which never disappoints. My only gripe about this company is that they use canned whipped cream. Like come on, make that shit fresh or buy something better than Ready Whip."}
{"text":"Had a great time with family. There was no waiting, no cold food . We enjoyed the meal and Tameka took good care of us. We will be back."}
{"text":"Last night we did the Curb-side To Go ordering and were very happy with the result! The food was ready a couple of minutes after we arrived (we got there earlier than expected) and the portion sizes are huge!

The food tasted great, I'm sure we'll do this again."}
{"text":"Had the herb crusted salmon / steak dianne combination. They burnt the little medallion steak pieces that were under 1 cm thick. How do you burn tiny pieces of steak like that that only need to be cooked a small amount???  The burnt taste ruined the steak medallions. The salmon was perfect.  Also had Ahi Capaccio and that was delicious, but a bit overpriced for the amount.

The strawberry shortcake was not to my liking. The replacement for the soft, moist shortcake cake was this hard crusty, and ultimately soggy crust like pieces. I did not like it one bit.  

The server was very good and did a good job, but he was somewhat awkward socially."}
{"text":"Great service and menu selection. Always seems busy but staff is very friendly and efficient. A fair amount of healthy options. Pricing is a bit high but not unreasonable. Definitely worth trying some of their \"superfood\" selections."}
{"text":"I went in for dessert and coffee by myself. I couldn't decide between my top 4 picks for cheesecake (SO MANY OPTIONS. IT'S OVERWHELMING.) I listed my top 4 options, and my super sweet waiter offered to bring my piece as a surprise. Delightful! The cheesecake was fantastic, and my waiter was (ugh, pun intended) the cherry on the top! :) Will definitely go back when my sweet tooth strikes again."}
{"text":"We had a great little family dinner last night! All of our food and drinks was fantastic but the best part was our server Rami!! He was so attentive and sweet and our son loved him!! Great job! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Bothersome trip out to the Williams-Gateway airport brought us here afterwards with family, and I was surprised how quiet it was.  Maybe the recession really did smack east Mesa around pretty badly.  Good service (very attentive), never an empty glass, food was prepared well and tasty, and of course room for dessert."}
{"text":"Busy location during prime time hours, but you're stupid if you come here (or anywhere on 83rd ave.) on Friday or Saturday night and expect it to not be busy.

Weekday lunch is great here with the extensive menu, especially appetizers, and of course the dessert.

What I like the most is the good service because they seem to have a good corporate model for training their employees.  I want to see the perma-smile even if the server is having a sucky day, and you can't over-service me or ask if I want another beer too many times.  I drink a lot, I tip well, so I'm not the person that you want to have an empty glass with on the table.  This place gets it."}
{"text":"A fan of cheesecake and have never been here several times and have never been disappointed. Red Velvet is oh so yummy. 
Food portions are Huge!  Menu is HUGE and could be very overwhelming to some which is why I stick to just the cheesecake"}
{"text":"The staff is great! Just had the Chargrilled Coulette Steak and it was phenomenal! It comes with French fries and onion rings but I skipped on the onion rings per gluten free. But seriously, the steak cooked medium is better than most steaks I've had at $$$$ steakhouses on the strip (and we've been to almost all of them). So that tells you to try it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory and for more than just their cheesecake. They food is pretty consistent flavor is usually there and great. My only dislike about this place is the lighting. It can tend to be really dark inside during dinner service. I don't know if it is to set a mood, but having to use your phone to see the menu is never a good look."}
{"text":"The best food they fried Mac and cheese balls burgers pasta and everything else is so amazing it's like a party I do recommend if you are hungry and want great service this the place to go"}
{"text":"Before heading back home after our softball tournament in Las Vegas, we decided to come this Cheesecake Factory in Henderson. Wow, Henderson or the Green Valley Ranch area is pretty nice, lots of great stores and restaurants. Getting side-tracked momentarily, so we headed inside the restaurant and it is quite a nice place. Almost has that Las Vegas feel to it!

This Cheesecake factory tasted like any other Cheesecake factory - Good Food. Pretty much anything that you order from the menu is gonna be quite delicious. I usually go with my favorite - the Lemon Herb roasted Chicken - simply amazing and a must.

Although there desserts they specialize in Cheesecake (which is great by all means), but try there chocolate cake which isnt too shabby at all!
If around the area again, definitely would stop by this place again!"}
{"text":"just ate here for brunch got the ricotta lemon pancakes best pancakes i ever ate with the buttermilk syrup and softest melting bites wife and i love it would recommend definitely"}
{"text":"Waiting time was 3 hours but, then again it  was the 4th of July
Angel hair pasta was very salty, notified our waitress she just apologized, my son had the chicken piccata and was so salty as well
Tell your waitress to make sure pasta is not salty
Utensils were all dirty including my plate
Overall food and portion is always great here"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been eating here for years, and have been a regular customer this summer. I've tried a variety of dishes: burgers, chicken tenders, buffalo chicken blasts, chicken romano, California cheesesteak... all delicious. The only one I didn't really care for was a pasta dish. I think it was a 3 cheese pasta. The chicken romano is my favorite and I've ordered it my last few visits. All of the dishes are a little pricey (chicken romano $17), but the portions are huge. I always have enough for lunch the next day. 

Drinks are delicious as well, and I think the prices are comparable to other restaurants. About $10 per specialty drink (I recommend the Sangria and the Greorgia Peach). I don't drink much beer or wine, so I'm not sure about those.

Onto the cheesecake... the Hershey's cheesecake = omg. It's a chocolate lover's dream. I also like the 30th Anniversary cheesecake. And I've tried both of the peanut butter cheesecakes, the Oreo cheesecake, and the turtle cheesecake. All good, but not enough chocolate for me! Cheesecake is about $8 a slice. (Tip: take-out slices are smaller. So order a slice to eat there, and then box it up if you can't finish. Yeahhh maybe I'm greedy, but if I'm spending $8 on a slice, I want my money's worth!)

Overall, I spend about $50 each visit.

I'd say that service is pretty good here. This goes for all restaurants, people: if it's busy, service might be a little slower. That's the risk you take when you go out on a Saturday night. But I've been here multiple times and I can't say that the service has ever been terrible.

I agree with other reviews about the din. It can be hard to converse when it's busy. And they're right that the lighting is dim. But, like the Melting Pot, I think that's all part of the ambience.

There is outdoor seating in the summer, and I'm all about outdoor seating. But this summer, there have been bands playing in front of the restaurant, and the music was so loud that we couldn't converse. This is my one and only gripe with this restaurant. I'm guessing that the bands are booked by South Side Works or something and has nothing to do with the Cheesecake Factory. But I wish they'd stop! Other than that, I'm a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"Wow, I have been to many Cheesecake factories and I usually love them. I have been  to this one a few times now and every time I leave I don't feel good ... Today again the food was very mediocre. Had chicken Marsala (Usually very good) and the meal was just terrible. The noodles tasted floury mashy ... The sauce was not done well and the quality of the chicken was just terrible. Ate half and returned it. At least the guy took it off the bill. Waiter was very friendly 

Now I am thirsty, have a head ache and a stone in my stomache ... Just horrible. I won't go back to this one ... Done with it. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"So I ordered take out 3 different times and every single time they screwed it up. 1st time I got there and only 1/2 my order was ready because they forget to make an entree so I waited in the lobby for thirty minutes until it was ready while my other food sat and got cold. 2nd time they completely forgot to pack one of my entrees and made my other entree completely wrong. 3rd time it was my wife's birthday and we got take out with a piece  of cheesecake as well  of course they forgot to pack the cheesecake even though the guy told me it was in there. I called the manager when I got home and you could tell he could care less as he asked me my name four times yet I told him it numerous times when he first got on the phone. \"Great\" listening skills. Obviously he does not care about his job or the service his employees are providing. I would not recommend ordering take out orders here."}
{"text":"So I place an order online yesterday to be ready for pick up at 445pm. I get there and it's not ready. The take out guy tells me they forgot to make one of the meals. Seriously how hard is it to read a take out order. So I have to wait for them to make it. Finally get it and of course my appetizer I ordered was suppose to be hot but not when I got as it was sitting waiting for my order to be completed. I speak to the manager and he apologizes and tells me they have new people in the back and does not what they are doing. He writes off the one meal I was waiting for. Their food is expensive as is at least make sure it's ready when ordered. Not sure if I will return here."}
{"text":"I mean it's the Cheesecake Factory. They aren't reinventing anything and have been around a long time. Service is good, food is delicious and decently priced, atmosphere is moderately lit ambiance and there's cheesecake. Reception at this location could use some help in greeting and looking welcoming but hey they are the gate keepers to my cheesecake."}
{"text":"One star for service. Walked in tonight to pick up a slice of cheesecake. How hard is it to put a slice in a little container ? Well super hard apparently. Stood in line... Waited and waited. Someone finally came to assist and completely ignored me and started helping people who were in line behind me. I told her all I needed was that small slice in front of her. I must be dead cause I was ignored completely. Who does that? I am honestly so confused on why someone would hire someone so rude and unprofessional"}
{"text":"Weird service. When I asked for a table, the concierge told me that the wait would be a half hour and that I could take a seat at the bar. But her tone betrayed something fishy was going on. I understand that you don't want to seat a person to a whole table because they won't be buying as much, especially on a crowded night, but....whatever.

Portions are huge and are boxable. 

Guacamole was not bad, if not overly rich. The chips that came with it were crisp and substantive, like freshly forged iron shovels scooping snow out of driveways. They were not as hard as iron though, just amply crispy.

The salmon in ginger sauce was a find. I did not expect a food item of such high quality in a place like this. It was an appetizer, but I don't remember the exact name."}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner for 3. We were seated right away! The waiter was cool! He was easy going and attentive! He made sure we had everything thing we needed without checking on us every 5 minutes. I ordered the filet mignon with a side of sautéed spinach. The steak was done just right. Real juicy. I forgot to mention that we started out with the chicken lettuce wraps and they were a 10 out of 10!! I had an overall good dinner experience. I'll be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"1 star for the wait and no reservation allowed. 3 stars for the food as not all of what we ordered was hot and that great. However, the tiramisu cheesecake made up for any shortcomings. Will definitely return for more cheesecake but probably as take out only or when the lines isn't so crazy."}
{"text":"We've been to cheesecake factory a few times. This was by far my favorite one. We had server jennifer p. She was fast and funny and was great with my sense of humor. We ordered the potsicker s and they were phonomenal, these are by far the best I have had anywhere. It was a cheat weekend for me to I splurged on the Mac and cheese burger. I asked the waitress of I would regret eating this, and she said the aftermath would be to totally worth it. Food came out pretty slow, seemed like it took about 45 minutes. Jennifer did a great job of checking in on us and refilling our drinks in the meantime. We were told they had a couple of in training cooks so that was why it was going so slow. We finally got our food and it was amazing! I haven't haven't had a burger in a little over 2 months that I could have toppings on it and this was the best way to have a cheat weekend.  Although, the aftermath and regret only took 5 min to hit my belly. The burger used my intestines as a water slide! Great burger but be willing to use public restrooms!"}
{"text":"Tabi did a great job. It was my wife's birthday so we have the 4 of us here for dinner. We all ended up getting cheesecake and having dinner. I'm kind of picky so I have lots of special requests. She did so good I gave her way better than 20% tip. Ask for Tabitha for awesome service with a smile"}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's \"big date place\". We always come early because we eat dinner early (2:30). There is sometimes a wait, especially during December. Even once when we came on my birthday in December on a Monday. We are picky eaters, but we love our favorites from Cheesecake Factory. Currently we are on a fried chicken sliders and fries phase.  Delicious. The fries are delicious. It is very hard to find fried chicken in the area...any suggestions? I love the Strawberry Lemonade.  The alcoholic drinks are great, but pricey for the size.  We don't like cheesecake so I cannot give you my review of dessert since we've never gotten it. I always want to try a pasta dish, but never want to miss out on the fries."}
{"text":"I have never a review for any Cheesecake, and I realize that I need to write one, even though probably.  I have actually been to this particular location twice for work group events.  I have to say there were impeccable and gave 100% without errors.  

Now to the food....Man everything is good here!  I honestly have never had a bad dish or dessert item here.  Even their brown wheat bread tastes superb.  If you are watching calories, then check out another restaurant, lol."}
{"text":"I went here last week for dinner. There were a lot of people ahead of us but we were seated within 5 minutes.

The restaurant is very clean and spacious. It has 2 dining floors and an outside portion where you can watch the animatronix  show,  the show is very loud so if you prefer quietness, stay inside. It also g wet s very dark outside, as they turn off the lights for the show.

The decor of the place is very classy. High ceilings with hanging fixtures. The place is very dim inside so it does have a classy - romantic feel to it. 

The menu features a full course dining option from appetizers  to desserts. 

They serve a complimentary french and honey oat bread with butter. It's very delicious and filling so thread carefully!
I got the avocado chicken club and it was delicious. It was served with fries that was also good as well. The club could use less tomatoes but that's juston preference!

I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Probably should not have come on National Cheesecake Day. It was a zoo, and disorganized. Was escorted to a table that already had people at it, after we had waited for over 45 minutes after we were told 30 min wait. Husband ordered the jambalaya and it was dry, asked for more sauce. Ordered Swiss mushroom burger medium and it was not. Already had waited for my food didn't wait for them to redo it, and there is always the fear someone will do something to your food. Second bad experience at this location. Save your time and go to Caesars location for better service."}
{"text":"I went here because I was craving drinks and appetizers and the cheesecake factory is always freshly made and doesn't suck. I was let down, the bread at this location was dry and tasted like it had been sitting out which is very unlike the locations in California I am used to. the rest of the food was alright, bit I feel like we either got an off night or this location is not quite up to par."}
{"text":"After eating Fish & Chips at this location not too long ago, I was not interested at all to ever eat here (or any location) again.  Then, I received a Gift Card for $50 for Cheesecake Factory.  Delayed, delayed and delayed using this card because of their sorry food.  Even the Cheesecake was dry.

Yesterday I attempted to use the gift card for take-out.  As before, I called the To-Go number only to be put on HOLD.  Three calls, three ON HOLD.  After one minute I hung-up.  This is a TERRIBLE ran establishment.  I drove to this location to order my take-out which you do at the Bakery register.  I stood there about 45 seconds while the girl was searching for \"god knows what\".  Then she took my order with the POS system.  I thought she was looking for a pencil to take my order.  What was she looking for?  

Long story short, The Italian Sandwich was totaling boring...just another sandwich on hard, stiff Artisian bread.  The other order was Bellagio Chicken.  Though the chicken was tender and flavorful, the pasta was either under or over cooked.  Tough pasta is a sin.  It was gross.  The bill for two entrees and two cheesecakes $48.41.  I left the gift card with a balance of $1.59 in the parking lot.  Truly the BEST place for it.  Buh-bye."}
{"text":"location i guess a positive point.Rest all are fine, nothing special."}
{"text":"Ahh one of my favorite chains.  When I'm home visiting family everyone knows this is a must stop for me. I have NEVER been disappointed by their food, drinks, service or ambiance. Dining with a large party is always a challenge, but not here! They go out of their way to accommodate and provide the appropriate number of wait staff.  Hats off to the kitchen because all 9 entrees were delicious.  Being a food and nutritionally aware diner I appreciate the calorie count and the lighter fare...especially the Ahi Tuna Tartare. 

Thank you Cheesecake Factory for serving me another great evening!"}
{"text":"I have only been to one other Cheesecake Factory. And it was for my senior prom in LA, so it's not too memorable.
This was our first time at this location, and we LOVED it!!!! We went for lunch, and were seated straight away.
We loved everything from the food to the service!
Our waiter, Tom, was awesome! Super cool, chill dude. I love when waiters are just themselves around you, no weird vibes like they're trying to play it cool or be fancy. So ask for Tom!
For the food, I have Celiacs, so I had to get GF. But man that was probably the best tasting gluten free meal I think I've ever had at a restaurant! We got the farfalle with roasted garlic, I think? And it was just amazing! You couldn't even tell it was GF! I can't express how AMAZING that was. And Tom even said that most of their pasta dishes (and burgers) can be made gluten free. Uh major bonus!
And of course I got the chocolate Godiva cheesecake (cause it's the only GF option). But man it was wonderful! Very rich though, so you gotta love that intense chocolate taste!
I just wish it were closer, as I live in North Tempe. 
But I will most certainly be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"going out to eat should be a treat, but it is SOOOO noisy in this restaurant you really can't hear others at the table.  our waiter - aiden - had to be asked several times to bring the dressing, refill the beverages, bring the check, etc.  we asked for 'to go' cups for our tea, and after 2 requests, he brought full cups.  usually this would be ok, except he brought the wrong drink.  thinking we would get home and enjoy our tea; we added spenda, and surprise surprise!  not tea!  you may think not a big deal, it's just tea.  but if you are looking forward to something, and you don't have any tea at home, it's disheartening.   a call to the manager, chris, resulted in absolutely nothing.  he could have cared less and gave some lip service about how he was going to speak to aiden.  not going back.  no need to give my business to a restaurant that doesn't care when there are so many others to choose from."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is popular here. The menu is like 1,000 pages and extensive.
They really could make it more compact. Anywho, I really liked my California omelet, it had lots of toppings and was a generous portion. My family also enjoyed their meals, and we got a comped menu item due to the long wait for it (the manager stopped by to surprise us with this). That was nice of him and certainly appreciated. Good place for large portions and huge variety."}
{"text":"This is about the closest restaurant to my workplace yet I was worried it would be too hectic for me to enjoy it! 
I had to go for Half Price Cheesecake days, and I arrived shortly after opening. To my surprise, there was no one sitting at the bar. I had the new salted caramel cheesecake which is quite delightful! It has a blonde brownie bottom and I love cheesecake that is a combo even more! 
They really should do the half price deal more often than once a year! 
This place is sparkly new & clean and I hope to return to check out the happy hour!"}
{"text":"Dining in any restaurants in Ceasar are criminally over-priced just like anywhere else in vegas but not necessary good quality, unless you live on food court food.  

However, the Cheese Cake factory in the Forum shop is actually a gem on the strip, providing if you are not looking for a fine dining experience.

Price overall was very reasonable for a sitdown restaurant in Vegas.  Speed was efficient.  Service was considerably good.  Friendly & helpful staff.   Of the 7 days stay at Caesar for a conference, we had tried their paste, salmon special, some burger and fries, fish and chips, flat-bread  appetizer & pot sticker.  

Ax the board, their food quality were consistent and were above and beyond other restaurants of the same franchise.  In fact, we liked their salmon lunch special (miso, simply grilled) so much that we went there almost every day we stayed there. 

I am giving a 4 star for their location, and for $ value with respect to their overall food quality and services.  Would recommend for families and individuals on budget / biz trip."}
{"text":"One does not simply walk into the Cheesecake Factory! 

The reasons are twofold. First, the columns look like the eye of Sauron (see picture). Second, the wait for dinner is always at least 20 minutes. On a weekend night, expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour. 

Boy and I attempted to go to the CF on a Friday evening and were given an hour plus wait time. We decided to go to the Claddagh instead (but that's another review). We went back on Sunday evening, and it was still very crowded. We waited for about 20 minutes at the bar.

My biggest peeve with the Cheesecake Factory, however, is the menu. It's as thick as a Dickens novel! In social science, they call the weariness one gets from having too many choices \"analysis paralysis.\" I felt this in abundance. 

Finally, I settled on a turkey burger with a side salad and my very lovely boyfriend chose the meatloaf.  We split an appetizer of nachos. 

The nachos were ok, but they were quite bland despite it being topped with jalapenos. I enjoyed my turkey burger and salad, but my ever-so-handsome boyfriend didn't like his meatloaf much.  I think they snuck some mushrooms into it. I found it to be overly salty. 

*Boy grew very upset and outwardly showed his displeasure at having mushrooms in his meatloaf. He hopped onto the table and screamed \"My PRECIOUS meatloaf!\" A waiter shortly stopped by to assuage the angry customer, but boy bit his finger off and took the ring he was wearing.  Using this one ring, boy was now free to move invisibly about the kitchen, removing every mushroom in sight. After he had completed this task, he destroyed the evil ring in a bubbling pot of artichoke dip.  Some eagles came and took us back to the South Side, having strangely been absent for the first two parts of our dining experience.*

Oh, we also shared some Snickers cheesecake. It wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Came here to enjoy an \"adult milkshake\" and a slice of cheesecake with the boy (what can I say, we were feeling gluttonous that day). We sat at the bar an ordered a Flying Gorilla to split. It had little chunks of chocolate in it and was pretty tasty, no complaints there. The server brought us bread out as well. The brown bread was good, but the white bread was hard as a brick. We also ordered a Smore's Galore cheesecake, and sweet baby Jesus was that a sugary slab of something. It was delicious, but made us both a little sick to our stomachs after a few bites. Not sure how any human being could consume a whole slice in one sitting. When I went home I looked up the calorie count out of curiousity- it was about 1,600 per slice! No wonder it took us three days to finish it! Next time I come, I'll bring a party of 6 for a single slice of cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Got right in - a true Christmas miracle at CCF!  Adore the Hibachi Steak and my guy loves the meatloaf!  We both really like the dark wheat bread...and butter...yummy  Great service, best menu choices, and yum yum food/drinks!"}
{"text":"OK, I went in with really high expectations from everything I've heard about this place. We went on a Friday night around 8 and only had about a 15-20 minute wait. We were seated and our waiter seemed very nice at first and told us to take our time and soak in everything. I was amazed at the menu, it had anything and everything you could possibly want and then some.  The fried Mac & Cheese balls were AMAZBALLS and our food was delicious. 
I was very disappointed with our service though, he started off great, and I don't know what happened, but it seemed like we were bothering him by sitting in his section. He treated the other two tables he was waiting on very different and was super friendly but any time he came to the table we had to request refills on drinks and he just never checked in at all. This was a huge disappointment because like I said I had super high expectations coming in.   

Bad Service aside, the Cheesecake is to DIE for!!!!! Oh My Goodness, My husband tried the original cheesecake, but I had to go all in. I got the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  It was a layer of brownie, topped with a coconut chocolate chip cheese cake, topped with chocolate cake, and if that wasn't fat enough it also had a coconut pecan frosting on it.  Yes it was a completely fat *ss item, but it was so worth it. I would stay on the elliptical all day to have that once a week. 

Overall it was an ok experience.  The food was AMAZING, but the service was very disappointing. :( I will definitely  give it another try and for sure at least get some cheesecake to go."}
{"text":"Located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet for a good meal at a good price! I like to sit in the patio section that extends out into The Forum Shops. It's great for people watching and has a view of a big, beautiful aquarium with lots of exotic fish swimming around. You also get to see(mostly hear) \"The Fall of Atlantis\" fountain show on the hour, every hour from the patio. This location gets very busy, so give your name to the hostess and be prepared for a wait!"}
{"text":"What a classy place! The Cheesecake Factory is awesome because it can be treated as both a high class restaurant or a casual hang. It's definitely a multipurpose restaurant. The staff is beyond friendly and the vibe of the restaurant is really relaxing. 

The one thing I'd be aware of is the wait. At dinner time, the wait can be pretty obnoxious so call ahead of you can. Other than that, this restaurant is top notch in my eyes."}
{"text":"Favorites : shrimp and chicken gumbo, steak Diane, chicken pot stickers, factory burger, ultimate red velvet cheesecake"}
{"text":"At lunch and my plate comes out with hair on it. I mention this to our server and she asks if I want my food remade. I'm not sure why I was even asked this question?!? This among a long list of other things that went wrong. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We went back for my birthday yesterday, and had a fantastic time. It's funny that a chain restaurant is one of the best places we've eaten at. Consistently great, friendly service. Delicious food. Quick service. What more can you ask for? My youngest son had the edamame, pot stickers (which are crazy good), and french fries. My oldest and I started out with the nachos, which were good, but the cheese tastes like it's from a can. He had the chicken and biscuits which reminded me of a deconstructed pot pie. He absolutely loved it. I had the steak Diane and herb crusted salmon with lemon sauce- incredibly good. For dessert we ordered the apple crisp, the double chocolate cake (I think that's what it was called), and the key lime cheesecake. So freaking good. All of it. I can't recall our waitresses name, but she was seriously the nicest, friendliest gal ever! My youngest talked her ear off and she was fun and engaging with him. She really made the night more enjoyable. So far this is our favorite special occasion stop, and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went to the cheesecake factory at the forum shops with my girlfriend for dinner and was not impressed at all. 

I had the fettuccine Alfredo. I'm not picky about my food but it had ZERO flavor. Some of the noodles were stuck together and hard from getting cooked on the bottom of the pot. The chicken breast on the noodles had zero seasoning.

The service was very poor, the waiter didn't ask how our food was, and didn't come around much at all. I had to ask for a refill on my drink when ordering dessert. 

The noise is also very loud, I wouldn't recommend coming here for a romantic dinner that's for sure. We sat near the kitchen and it was REALLY loud. They don't have doors that seperate it from the dining area. 

The margaritta was 12.00 for a regular size. It was good though. 

I'd only go here  again for cheesecake to go."}
{"text":"I was disappointed on this visit.  They brought a completely burnt piece of miso salmon to our table. I flagged down a manager because our server was no where to be found and he had it remade but this time it was actually raw inside.  How can this dish that we have enjoyed at least twenty times over the last two years suddenly be so messed up twice in one day?"}
{"text":"The waiter was soooooooooooo nice!!! Nice meal with fam!!! The Hershey's chocolate cheesecake was a little bit too sweet, recommend sharing!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Party of 8. Took 45 minutes to get our food and it was obvious that half the food sat under a heat light. Vegetables were cold, steak was over cooked. We didn't want to wait 45 minutes for new food so we just ate.  Best part is that they didn't come any dinners. We had 2 pieces of cheese cake and they comped 1. Thanks a lot. Overall this was a terrible experience. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Love coming here and spending a small fortune on wonderful food!!! I get the shrimp scampi everytime!!!and my husband gets the steak Diane we never have any problems. The service is excellent.  Sometimes there is a wait..but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is definitely a favorite of ours. 

We love the pasta there every single kind of :)
They have a huge selection, even have a skinnylicious menu where you can find really good food with less calories, more greens etc- good for the clean eaters out there :)

The only thing that they could work on is the service. We've been there a couple times and always had rude servers.  

Over all- thumbs up to the factory!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. We sat at the bar because the wait was half an hour at 4 on a Tuesday but that's fine it's busy I get it. We asked for water to start but the girl seemed to have forgotten. It wasn't that busy but she was screaming insults at another waitress so I guess she was preoccupied. After 20 minutes she came back and asked if we were ready to order. I ordered a Pina colada which was fine at first but after 10 minutes it began to curdle and tasted like vomit! Since when do Pina coladas curdle??? Wtf. The cheesecake was okay, definitely doesn't live up to the hype. When we finally got one glass of water, the glass smelled like raw eggs! It was absolutely disgusting, are they too busy to clean their dishes?! We weren't checked up on once and by the time I paid I was so disgusted that I didn't tip to express my dissatisfaction And I always tip, always. This was the first time I didn't tip. Guess what happened the girl basically screams \"OH SO CHEAP!\" So that everyone at the bar could hear. First of all you're service is shit, your glasses are dirty and my drink was disgusting. If you need to shame people into tipping you, you don't deserve a tip. Not tipping was a way to express that I was dissatisfied, if I was happy with the service I would have happily tipped 18%. I've been to the cheesecake factory in the US and it's a wonderful experience. Extremely disappointed with this ripoff experience. First and last time at this place. I hope nobody has to experience what I went through and if you find yourself getting sick it's probably those dirty dishes they serve you in"}
{"text":"The hostess squeezes 7 people into a small booth and did nothing when was told its too small She adds a chair to the end if table for an adult to sit in the aisle and got bumped and had to get up multiple times We were all very uncomfortable especially after waiting 40 min for a table and it was not very busy This was at 6 pm on fri 9/29 We spent over $200 and had a horrible dinner This was our second large party in 2 months We will not be coming back anymore"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food was just such a hellish nightmare I cannot rate this any higher than a one star. The staff and service were friendly and attentive so they have that going for them. 
Wait time was 2 hours, typical for a Saturday afternoon. 

Items ordered:
Korean fried cauliflower - greasy salty mess, cauliflower was cooked from frozen
Pork belly sliders - pork belly was more fat than anything else, fried pickles were palatable 
Fish tacos - spiced rice was overly spiced and very dry, tortilla tastes like raw flour
Steak Diane and salmon fillet - steak was over done, the sauce just tastes like liquid salt. Salmon was definitely not fresh, the lemon cream sauce was something akin to a vinegar white liquid."}
{"text":"As much as i would like to give my server a higher rating for having an awesome personality, i cant. Due to the fact that she messed up my order and the wait time was to long that my hunger went away (what a waste of money) 
 I ordered a kids Mac and Cheese,Deluxe Cheeseburger Sliders with bacon,and fried mac and cheese balls.
 1/2 My order came 
- my burgers had no cheese and bacon, the wait time was 15mins,and the waitress said sorry we couldn't figure how to add it into the system with out charging it (but i was charged anyways)
 and my sons mac and cheese had no flavor, and i had to add salt.  
And my fried Mac and cheese balls never came out, i had to finally ask the waitress  and she didnt even write it down.  I was pissed! So the wait time for that was another 15 mins.  
My meal was ruined and when your dining with Toddlers, time is of the essence!  But what pissed me off is nothing was comp for my messed up order and the wait time.  This will be my last time dining at cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory is always a great option since there are so many selections on their menu and there is always something for everyone. I usually have one of my faves, which is the four cheese pasta which is sooooooo yummy! It's penne pasta, with mozzarella, ricotta, romano, and parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"I find it a bit pricey. The portions were good, the food was good, the drinks were strong, the cheesecake was too sweet for my liking.

Oreo Cheesecake - shared with a friend and we didn't end up finishing it. They're big, dense slices. 

Mac and Cheese burger - was wonderful, too bad I filled up on bread before I got to my main. I only ate half of my main. Wished there were more mac and cheese though.

Avocado eggrolls - stuffed with avocado, sun dried tomatoes, cilantro. Anything with avocado is amazing. I don't like sweet sauce but the eggrolls itself was amazing."}
{"text":"Tonight's experience...six pm wait in line...Seven pm get to front of line...to be told come back in 30 minutes for an estimated wait time of 3 hours...7:30pm get buzzer...10:30pm...still no page of table ready...go up to desk...to be told please go to the back of the line and wait until it's your turn...while overhearing that people with buzzers still have a wait time of about an hour....thank you but no thank you here is your buzzer!  As popular as this restaurant is, a reservation option even with a guaranteed deposit to hold a table would be great.  Their current system is mass chaos and leaves many excited diners disappointed and settling for \"wherever has a table\".  I like to plan ahead of time and would like the option of reserving my dinner a week ahead of time if that's what it takes for me to avoid waiting insane hours in line and still ending up at a different restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food and a Beautiful Atmosphere. The Booths where we sat were tall and private. and the waiter showed up when you needed him. unlike some places where they are on you like a fly, this place was comfortable and just a nice place to dine. Great place to bring your wife or girlfriend. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Cheesecake factory. I suggest getting the chicken littles. They are tasty. 3 of us ordered them, and we all were very happy with our meal. We also ordered the fried cheese. It was smaller than we had expected. The server was very friendly and attentive. The bread was burned, but she quickly exchanged it out for us. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My most recent visit since last year was two nights ago with my line sister! She invited me to eat Cheesecake Factory because she was craving it and staring at the menu while she was studying. So we ended up going there after my shift at work.

Friday night. Busy night. We pull up and everyone's waiting to get seated. A whole bunch of parties ahead of us, but there were only 2 of us so the wait was about 30 minutes. Not bad. We waited. Got seated. On a tiny tiny table.

Our server was quick and attentive. His name was Sayem or Sam I think? I'm not too sure but he's indian. I think..... Anyway, good thing we shared appetizers! We got four different plates. A house salad with mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoes, and balsamic vinaigrette. Fried Mac 'N Cheese balls--macaroni put into a ball, deep fried, with creamy marinara and parmesan cheese sauce. Fried calamari (self explanatory)--however it's paired with cocktail sauce (I prefer marinara). Buffalo blasts-- chicken marinated in buffalo sauce wrapped in a wonton and deep fried. However, ours was SO breaded and there was literally a tiny bit of chicken in there...... 

Overall, our server made the experience an awesome one! :) Ask for him!"}
{"text":"Hungry, but don't know what you want? They have it here! The Cheesecake Factory has an enormous menu with every type of food you could crave. The service here is pretty consistent but there can be very long waits when it's busy. 

Some of my favorites are the factory chopped salad, fish tacos, chicken and garlic pasta and the avocado eggrolls which I've never seen anywhere else. The food is always good and usually comes out quickly, even when they are busy.

Of course I can't come here without getting a piece of cheesecake. The red velvet is delicious, loaded with cream cheese. I also like the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake. It's one of my new favorites. For being a chain restaurant the Cheesecake Factory delivers a great experience with good service and a wonderful selection of food."}
{"text":"I met friends at CF for dinner last night. Our table had the mini hot dogs, the sliders (mini burgers), meatloaf, chicken buffalo sandwich, chicken littles, Ahi tartar and the dumplings . Aria was our server and took care of us (even though we can tell she wasn't feeling well). She maintained the table's needs (refills, etc) with very little interruption. For dessert we had the Lemon Meringue which has become my favorite cheesecake. Good experience, food and its price and of course the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Waitress not attentive (failed to refill drink) and my Luau Salad was not fresh (greens appeared to be sitting around too long somewhere in their kitchen).  If our group were not pressed for time and this establishment being busy, I would've sent it back.  

I'm not impressed; however, at least the cheesecake was superb!"}
{"text":"Today I had the Mexican Tortilla Salad and it was pretty good. Big portion but good. Ample parking. It was about a 15minute wait. Good service."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Started with the Buffalo Blast appetizer! Amazing! The pizza and soup,were both good and of course the cheesecake was outstanding. The service was excellent and we waited less than 5 minutes to get in. The only problem I had with it (as seems to be the case with many restaurants in Vegas) is actually finding it."}
{"text":"The only reason why I put one star is because the cheesecake is phenomenal. Me and my bf dined there one night he got the mac n cheese burger and I got like a western one , our server I think her name was Amanda talk blonde girl , never checked up on us and I watched every one else that was sat after us get there food and we sat for about 2 more hours with no food other parties that were there after us left already , then one guy comes up to us apologizing about the food delay , and that he would take care of it , well then the food came and finally.our server comes back apologizing for it taking forever , well the burgers were gross over Cooked, Mac n cheese was dry with rubbery noodles , we didn't even finish it , then we get the bill and we got no discount no nothing , they didn't take care of us at all , we paid the bill and left and will never be dining in there again ever just going in to get  cheesecake to go for now on. The only thing good there is the cheesecake , poor poor poor service"}
{"text":"I know - it's a chain.  I live walking distance to the Cheesecake Factory.  I love that they offer a HUGE reduced calorie menu.  They have a whole menu of skinnylicious items, that are all delicious and under 590 calories.  If you want to splurge, of course, they have a HUGE regular menu, and incredible cheesecake.  Don't skip going to Cheesecake Factory if you think you will ruin your diet - trust me - they have a lot of healthy options."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and loved it. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was divine. I had never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory until now and I am thoroughly impressed. Bathrooms were neat and clean, seating was comfortable, atmosphere was nice. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a very good Cheesecake Factory. The service was exemplary but Heather was outstanding. Very attentive yet not overbearing. The food was very good. We had Calamari, Endive salad, Ahi Carpaccio. The perfect light dinner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake factory use to be the place to go... not anymore the food portions have been reduced in size dramatically as well as the size of the cheesecakes. The quality is nothing what it once was. Yet the prices have only gone up.   Cheesecake factory is now nothing more than a chain restaurant and it shows.  It's now nothing more than a fancy Marie Callender's.. no thanks for me anymore."}
{"text":"I suggest you request a table during the Greek god/fire show (whatever it is) they have right across from the restaurant. We put our name down towards the end of the show and as soon as the show ended the entire crowd headed to the Cheesecake Factory and the wait was over an hour. We waited 15 minutes. Also, request to sit inside and away from the show, the 2nd time around it started while we were dining and it was extremely loud and annoying! The food and service here was great. Had the salmon with lemon sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes, so delicious and very filling. Didn't have room for cheesecake :("}
{"text":"The food was pretty exceptional and the service was well, but within 15 minutes of being seated a man at the table next to us began to vomit profusley for 30 seconds straight all over the place. The smell was pretty overwhelming and it made the meal pretty impossible to enjoy, yet the staff failed to apologize for the inconvenience and also did not offer to make part or all of the meal complimentary, which is the least you can do after something that disgusting happened. Kind of ruined the restaurants image for me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Cheesecake Factory! We come about 4 times a month. The service is always amazing. Never had a bad experience!

Ceasar dressing is my fav, garlic noodles, and cashew chicken!

I don't want this to reflect on the stars, however I dislike the mall, and I dislike having to drive in the mall parking lot to go to this location, I deal with it anyway because I love the food and service! :)"}
{"text":"Been here many times. But since I consider doing Yelp just recently, it's gonna be my first making reviews on this  place. 
This restaurant has always been excellent (for me) it's one of my favorite restaurant 
Well, I am just soo easy to please. As long as the restaurant has any of the following:
1.) Not just serve good food but delightfully great food!
2.) Server is fast, attentive to the needs of the customers  and has a cheerful attitude 
3.)the overall appearance of the restaurant is clean
4.)restrooms that are clean.
This one got those. My favorite thing also is the bread and butter..I love the rye bread that they serve, it's so yummy! 
And lastly, who doesn't like their cheesecakes? YUM!!! That seals the deal LOL
We went here today with our friends. And we are more than satisfied! I usually order the Chargrilled New York Steak..it's perfectly done the way I wanted! It's really MASARAP!! (delicious) 
Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The menu is vast! They are not on the no wait app though so be careful during peak times. The cheesecake is always good. I am the biggest fan of their egg roll sampler. Comes with 4 different kinds that are each delicious. I had the shrimp scampi on my most recent trip and my husband had the bang bang shrimp and chicken. Both were very good!"}
{"text":"Was just reminded of a date that I went with CT here...Food is always decent & service is cool- I thought of this spot because it was a very nice date with great conversation & great company...Always a good time out with CT...Would definitely venture again...Good times..."}
{"text":"We think we were mid shift. Mid shift food and mid shift service. Thinking about arriving at 4 instead of 3... FYI"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now.  The first time I went, the appetizer came out after the meal.  Also, I was at the place for over an hour for lunch, and most of that was just waiting for food. 

I decided to give it a second try, again waiting over an hour.  Place is extremely slow, avoid this place, unless you have an hour and half to have a simple lunch."}
{"text":"I'm struggling to give them 3 stars. They were not terrible but this location was also not impressive. The service was ok and I was a little disappointed the happy hour ended at 6. This place was convenient but not what I wanted for my Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Dinner prices for lunch.

That's what I thought when looking at the menu this afternoon. But, I was meeting with a former coworker and dear friend who had her perfect baby girl almost two months ago and she needed to get out of the house, so it was a date. She was running late so I ordered the ahi tartare, which is served over chopped avocados and soy sauce. This was very good, and helped to curb my appetite until she arrived. I ordered the lunch pizza, which comes with a salad. I try to go for a white pizza because red sauce some times tends to disagree with me. A pretty good pizza. The salad was fine as far as salads go, but the shredded carrots and cucumbers proved to be messy and I ended up with enough salad on my lap to feed a family of rabbits. Seriously, normally I'm not nearly as messy.

Heather, our server, was great! She managed to be attentive without hovering, an important yet rare quality that landed her a dandy tip.

But all that pales in comparison to my wonderful dining companions, one of whom I'm proud to call a friend and the other who will hopefully be calling me Uncle in the near future."}
{"text":"We love eating at the Cheesecake Factory. The grand kids love their menu. The food is great and they have low carb options. The portions are large and we enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I had at a cheesecake factory till date. We wanted to buy a cake with only 8 pieces and they said we had to buy 12 pieces in order to be arranged as whole cake that can be cut. So we ordered six red velvet and six chocolate tower cake. When we finally got it, they were put in two separate boxes. The whole reason we bought 12 pieces in the first place was so it could be arranged as a cake. The guy that handed us the order was extremely rude when we asked him why they were put in two separate boxes. 

The service at this cheesecake factory needs to get on par with what the brand is known for."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed. Their skinnylicious menu is excellent. The wait is a bit long to get in but if you have time it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is pretty run of the mill. From the overwhelming selection of food on the menu (seriously, pick a damn food theme!) to all the crazy ads in the menu, it always takes me years to get through the menu. And even though I've been to Cheesecake Factory 324890789459843 times, I never eat the cheesecake there. Well, I can't say never; I did ONCE, got massively sick and haven't touched any cheesecake since. You must be wondering why I still go back to Cheesecake Factory? You know what, I wonder why I go back too."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the wonderful service of our waitress Allie tonight.  Not only did she provide excellent customer care with our rowdy group of four, but she went well above and beyond to assist us with some extra goods that were soon to be thrown out, and to congratulate our group on some of our recent endeavors.  I have yet to see such a wonderful, happy, service-focused individual who went so above and beyond, even if it was almost midnight.  

The food was excellent, and the service provided was even more to die for.  Thank you Allie for giving us such a wonderful end to our day!"}
{"text":"my bf and i were seated right away when we came here around 6pm. I had the Evelyn's pasta, which wasn't very good. It was on the light side, so I didn't enjoy it. My bf got some pasta with bacon, peas, and a creamy sauce, which was very good. We had two alcoholic ice cream drinks called caramel twister and kahlua kisser were both strong. I liked the sticky caramel though. The drinks were are about $8.50. Our bill was $40+. I really liked the strawberry creamsicle alcohol drink back at the one in san jose, CA. It has no alcoholic taste, but i guess its vegas, so they hook it up."}
{"text":"Cheesecake factory's a solid. I got the shrimp scamp and steak duane. I keep trying to write Diane and it keeps saying Duane. Now I'm gonna google steak Duane cause I like all different names of steak. It was amazing! And the crab bites (6 bites) Zucchini fries, hubs got Louisiana chicken pasta or something, and Adams peanut butter cheesecake. I mean the wait right?? The parking right?? We all know this right? Staff always nice. Can't comment on the bathroom situation, didn't visit. Tho I enjoyed cheesecake tv while i waited. 

We went on a Saturday arriving at like 4:15pm 45. Minute wait. Pretty much spot on. 

Ok.. Here's the prob.... While I was waiting! People! Get up! Get up and let and old person sit down! How about seriously a 75 year old grandpa? Nope How bout an old man with a cane??? Nope Oh... Oh... Mr young meathead? Sat there the whole time girlfriend stood in uncomfortable boots? Good grief. Grandpa with kid on shoulders? Stood. Mother holding child and purse? Stood. Couple in thirties sat the whole time playing clash of clans oblivious to themselves, each other and their surroundings. 

Cheesecake Factory always a solid. Humanity??? Not so much."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch with the baby on Saturday.   We were seated immediately and the server got us our drinks and some warm bread and butter right away.  Our server was very friendly (in fact just a little too sugary sweet) and she did her job well.

We ordered from the lunch menu.  I got the Miso Salmon and my husband ordered the cheese pizza.  Our food was out within 15 minutes and mine was delicious, but my husband said his pizza was just so-so and about the same quality as a cheese pizza from Sam's Club.  (OUCH!)

Anyway, our bill for two passion fruit iced teas, a lunch pizza, a lunch salmon and a slice of the pina colada cheesecake (to go) was $42, before gratuity.  The baby just ate off of my plate because she is too little for her own plate still.

I ate the pina colada cheesecake slice later that night and it was just okay.  It may just be me, but I think that their more exotic cheesecake flavors aren't nearly as good as the plain old vanilla bean cheesecake.  Maybe it's because the other ingredients in the more exotic cheesecake varieties detract from their perfect vanilla cheesecake recipe...?  I dunno what it is, but I've experienced this phenomenon more than once.  Sadly this time I thought it'd be different with the promising pina colada flavor, but it just didn't deliver.  It didn't taste very tropical, or very cheese-cakey.  I'll just remind myself to order the plain vanilla cheesecake next time and stop being drawn in by the tempting siren song of the exotic cheesecake flavors."}
{"text":"The food and service was great as usual. The wait wasn't long at all. It was a nice night we chose to sit outside on the patio since it doesn't happen much. My big issue is they have a smoking bench right outside the patio (which was less than 10 ft from my table), so while trying to enjoy my dinner I had cigarette smoke blowing right in mine and my toddlers face. It totally ruined my dinner and I left feeling like I needed a breathing treatment."}
{"text":"A great place to go always. Nice bar area and great service. The banana cream cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake. Please be careful all of their menu options have like a bazillion calories but they recently started offering a skinny version menu and all the items on there are great. Shrimp tacos!!! Burgers !!! Uuu the appetizer stuffed mushrooms are to die for and I also love the appetizer avocado rolls oh my God so delicious! Nice date location, and girls dinner out. 
.."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but that is about it it was 40 min to get in we waited 30 min to get are order taken only one refill never came back after are meal never asked us for cheesecake then had to gun down someone to bring us the check.  Where us the manager as we did not see one walking around or asking how was everything.  Just very poor customer service"}
{"text":"Ahhh the cheesecake factory. An absolute nightmare for indecisive people like myself. 3 menus (regular, special, and skinnylicious) for me to debate over until I just about give up and order something spontaneous because the waitress has visited my table 3 times now asking if I \"still need more time\". And that begins our tale. My fellow yelper Madilyn and I headed into the Cheesecake factory tonight with an open mind... Yet I felt my choices were still made poorly. ANYWAYS, I got chicken samosas as my starter - it was actually delicious. Super hot and crispy, well spiced, and the cilantro sauce was an excellent pairing. Reminded me of a good Indian restaurant. Okay so the entree is where I feel I made the wrong decision. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which was listed as being \"very spicy\". First off... not spicy at all. So that was disappointing. Also the pasta was definitely overcooked, WAY past al dente and starting to all stick together.. almost mushy. I think there were 4 pieces of small shrimp. It still had an OK flavor - just not what I was expecting for $19. Ended up taking most of it home. OH- I also got a moscow mule and an asian pear martini. The moscow mule didn't even come in a copper mug... I wish I took a picture to show how sad it looked but it wasn't even worthy of one. But I gotta say the pear martini was amazing. I'm still giving 4 stars because of the following reasons - friendly, attentive staff - nice atmosphere - extensive menu - great bread/butter to start - it was actually WARM inside compared to other restaurants i've been to lately. Always a pleasant experience, as I've been here many times before. Will surely be back."}
{"text":"For reasons I don't fully understand I tried to eat here tonight.  As usual getting a seat was a chore...whether the place is crowded or not (not in this case).

Anyhow I sit down, menus arrive and then some moron walks up to talk with the folks in the table behind me and he's smoking a e-pipe!!!!   Really!!!!????  WTF!!!!!

Cheesecake Factory I'm putting this one on you for allowing it to happen. 

I'm done with you.

If zero was a choice I'd go with that."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. The atmosphere is always incredible. Although it is busy most often, I find that I get seated very quickly. Their employees are always extremely professional. The food is exquisite. This is, by far, my favorite restaurant. Never once have I had a bad experience here. I am very big on customer service and I must say our waiter did an outstanding job at providing us with quality service throughout the night."}
{"text":"Las Vegas cheesecake factory was great! They sat us quickly, under ten mins. 
It was the first time I tried the mushroom burger, I usually order the Cajun pasta and let me tell you I was not disappointed it was so good and full of flavor. To drink I had the pineapple Moscow mule and oh my goodness I loved it! Definite five stars."}
{"text":"Cheesecake was meh. Wasn't bad or anything out of the extraordinary. I had the coffee and cream chocolate extreme, lemon meringue and a carrot cake.

The cheesecakes weren't too overly sweet.  The carrot cake was soft and yummy . Only downside is the wait of 25 minutes for take out.  And the server had served cheesecake of 3 people who were behind me first while I was still waiting another 15 mins. When I confronted her about it she gets all feisty with a tone how she takes orders in order . My order was first and how 3 people who were behind me got their order before me ?"}
{"text":"I don't know why it is, that regardless of where I'm traveling, we end up hitting up The Cheesecake Factory.  At the time I had just arrived in and my friends and I were starving, so this seemed to be the only available spot that we could all agree on in Caesars's Palace.

Service was ok, we got seated right away, but we seemed to have a somewhat tough time tracking down our server at times.  Pretty standard fare as far as Cheesecake Factories go."}
{"text":"The service quality has definitely been stepped up here. The servers are nice and very friendly. Cheesecake Factory is pretty standard so the food is always consistent. 
I have rarely had to wait for a table here, and this location is fairly busy. So a great spot to come for a quick bite. I always request to be seated in Kelly's area, she's really great and is very attentive. 
Come for the yums!"}
{"text":"Swung in late prior to them closing and sat at the bar. The bar tender made sure we enjoyed our late night sweet tooth craving dessert. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"been there a couple of times , desserts good , but the foods really not , ordered steak diane and scampi last night , got 4 little less than bite size pieces of steak , normally steak diane is a small piece of steak , maybe they were just helping by cutting my meat for be , but when you cook little bite size pieces how can it be cooked medium rare , the shrimp scampi was 3 breaded fried shrimp with a sause , you know desserts good , ray"}
{"text":"The best Cheesecake Factory I've been too !!! And I've been to many in different cities! The food was seasoned to perfection and the service was wonderful.  I'm full and satisfied"}
{"text":"When you're with a bunch of people and are all hankering for different types of food, this is the place to go.  There are at least 20 pages worth of menu items ranging from Asian to American to Mexican to Italian.  The list goes on.  There's even a menu for the dieters called their Skinny Menu.  I am not a huge fan of corporate restaurants, but I'm not going to lie, this place never disappoints.  The items I usually order are:  Miso Salmon - delightful with salmon cooked to perfection laying over a bed of rice with this sweet and savory sauce drizzled on top.  I always ask for extra sauce on the side and they happily oblige.  I also order their chicken marsala with mushrooms - bow tie pasta with mushrooms, sliced chicken with a sweet and tasty marsala sauce.  I never can finish so I always have great leftovers the next day.  

I always order their passion iced tea and their \"brown\" bread given at the beginning is always warm and soft.  Service there is almost always great - attentive servers and the food and drinks come out pretty quickly.  

As for cheesecake, my favorite is their red velvet and their banana cream.  If I'm feeling really hungry still and have people willing to share, I love their strawberry shortcake.  It's too big to finish alone - you need at least 2 more friends to share it with."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy on a Thursday night which makes my heart happy. I love to see businesses thriving in AZ.  The service was fantastic. I was only in tonight for dessert and coffee. However,  I have eaten at CF many times and have never had a bad meal. They have great pasta dishes and a yummy Aloha themed salad. Today I had a piece of their Coconut and chocolate flavored cheesecake. It was of course yummy. Thank you Jodi for your wonderful service."}
{"text":"On a recent staycation to Caesars Palace, we had every intention on trying a nice restaurant, but we were feeling lazy and just wanted something easy and quick to eat. 

They were packed for a Sunday, but we were seated quickly. My chicken and avocado club was standard, not a huge fan of the fries, but they were decent. My fella got the catfish, which seemed like an odd choice and he didn't care for it and ended up eating half of my sandwich instead. We also took a pineapple upside down cheesecake, which was really good and had lots of nice big chunks of pineapple in it.

The food was standard and service was as well. Good spot to go when you're inside the Forum Shoppes that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"We had a gift card to use, so we arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday for dinner and they were packed! I was so surprised, but we waited patiently for our table and it wasn't too bad of a wait, about 10 minutes. 

We were seated and service was friendly and attentive considering how busy the restaurant was. Refills were plentiful and food was ok. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and although I was a little disappointed with my food choice, everyone else seemed to enjoy their food and portions were more than sufficient. There was so much food, we had plenty of leftovers to take home with us. 

I always remember the limoncello cake from previous visits, so we ordered that to share as well. Not as great as I remembered, but still solid and everyone was happy with the meal. Great service and pretty ok food for a chain restaurant. I'd definitely come back with a gift card or for happy hour in the future."}
{"text":"This Cheesecake Factory has 3 entries on Yelp.  It was Happy National Cheesecake Day on July 30 & July 31st, 2014 so I went over to a Cheesecake Factory (not this branch) to have a slice of cheesecake at 1/2 price!!

Anyways the following is my review for this location written back in February 2014:

I must confess that I am a diehard Cheesecake Factory fan!  Unless the service is very bad, I will not give them less than 4 stars.  This specific location inside Caesars Palace holds a special place in my heart, but I will not go into specifics.  Suffice it to say that I love this place!

Normally, I get here before it gets too crowded.  Sometimes I will have to wait, but it is worth the wait.  Will just wait and people watch or browse around some of the Forum shops til it is our turn.

The menu reads like a small book.  It can get confusing at times cause everything sounds so good.  Every appetizer and entree that I have had has not disappointed.  All are above average, and the portions are huge so come hungry.  

Of course, a meal here is not complete without dessert.  I will always save room for a slice of cheesecake.  If it means that I cannot finish my entree, then I will just take home the leftovers and enjoy it the next day.  I have tried over a dozen of their cheesecake flavors.  My current favorites are Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake, and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake.

I only have one complaint.  Stop discontinuing my favotite sandwiches.  They used to make a three cheese Grilled Cheese sandwich which was awesome.  They also used to make a Monterey Cheeseburger which was the bomb.  I truly miss those two items.  

With that being said, every time we return to Caesars Palace, going to this Cheesecake Factory is a must.  Many good memories here."}
{"text":"I was pretty shocked to learn that my pasta dish contained over 2000 calories.  Other than that, the pasta was nothing to rejoice about.  Couldn't end a night at the Cheesecake Factory without a slice of cheesecake!"}
{"text":"So tonight was CONFUSING. I walked in, gave my name, waited by the bakery. My name was called. I was told to walk upstairs. I waited AGAIN upstairs. And then asked to sit in an overcrowded, stuffy, overflow room.  And get this, the table was a small 2 top right outside of the kitchen. Literally, 3 steps out of the kitchen. Lord forbid a waiter trip or a cup of coffee slip off of a tray, scolded wouldn't even be the word.

Myself and my guest I was with, just left.   As we walked down the grand staircase, we walked past a manager that didn't even take the time to say goodbye or ask about the meal. The gentleman that directed us upstairs didn't even take the time to ask why we were leaving so soon, but instead \"I hope you enjoyed your meal!\" Bro, we weren't even here for more than 10 minutes.

Ultimately, I get that this location in Vegas is busy, but why is that? Cheesecake factory is a staple in every major city, patrons will eat there no matter what city they are traveling to.  But what i don't get is how the customer service can waiver between the different locations.  Just because the Vegas location stays packed from open to close, shouldn't mean that the hostess cannot take an extra moment while asking a name, \"just to let you know, we are seating in the upstairs overflow room, is that okay? Or would you prefer to wait for a table on the first floor?\"  This one question would have given me a 5 star experience because I would have elected to walk up approximately 42 stairs and sit in a separated environment."}
{"text":"Why is this location the lowest quality food out of all the cheesecake factories I've been too? I mean seriously our waiter today had an attitude problem, let out a huge gasp when we returned our stuffed mushrooms because of how pathetic they looked. Flat, barley any stuffing, like he's annoyed of the fact we are returning it? I'm annoyed because I love them and they just always suck at this location. White rice with my dish, so over cooked and mushy. Last time the rice was hard and undercooked. Shepard pie once here was like a soup, we returned it. I was served salmon once that was burned to a crisp, the person serving was like \"yes I'd return that too\" so then don't bring it out!!! This location is just not the same quality you can get at other locations and I've been to about 5 different ones nationwide. This is my favorite restaurant up in MA-the natick location. But here in Charlotte it's very disappointing. Corporate please send some secret diners in to see how bad it is here!"}
{"text":"This time everything was super.  I tried the almond salmon salad. It was amazing.  Maybe the Mojito needed more tequila. Steak Diane was very delicious."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is average/trash bc they serve way too many food items for anyone of them to be exceedingly tasty.

if you serve gumbo, kale soup, fried oysters, pizza, every italian dish, tacos and dear meat none of them can be that great.

not saying that I won't eat cheesecake factory. their alfredo is cool. but I've had some things that just weren't good. at all

Cheesecake Factory did excel in the making cheesecake. I will give them that.

Who else is feeling positive this evening?"}
{"text":"Always a good meal here with such an expansive menu.

Love the bread at the beginning, warm Sourdough or a brown bread.

Ordered many meals here and would recommend the Miso Glazed Salmon, Shrimp over Angel Hair Pasta, Orange  Chicken, Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms and their Build Your Own Omelette.

Then save room for the cheesecake of course, depending on your taste you can't be beat here. I go for the old school Strawberry Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake, Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake.

Prices are in the $12 - $20 range with good quality and huge portions.

Service is always top notch.

Even though this is a chain, it is always a go to restaurant and open late for the late night eaters."}
{"text":"Not into chain restaurants,  been to the original in Marina Del Rey, CA but enjoy coming to this location all the time.

This is a couple miles from our house in the Kierland Commons area which is always nice and well kept. 

Certainly our late night go to restaurant since it is open late and such a nice high quality clean safe place.

One of the most complete menus, the selection is almost to much to choose from the large novel. 

When coming in late I enjoy the \"Create your Omelet\". Always prepared well and the potatoes and toast is a full plate of food.

The service is always outstanding and there maybe a lot of people waiting but they get you in quickly. 

The decor is quirky if you like being in somewhere in Egypt but it is fun. The only issue is it is too dark where you could barely read the menu. 

Will come back again and again not only for late night but for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Great food and choices of wines and liquor... can't say anything negative about this place besides the wait time to be seated. That's expected on a Saturday night though."}
{"text":"The burger was very good, and the cheesecake was great (although it was takeout), you can split main meals as they are fairly large. More expensive then the US version of the restaurant. This restaurant is also a lot smaller then the ones in the US, in my opinion this is a feeler store, and they will be opening up a few more restaurants soon in the GTHA."}
{"text":"We have been seeing lots of long line ups all the time for a seat at the cheesecake factory so was surprised to not see one today on a Tuesday afternoon. We opted to get a take out cheesecake to avoid the tipping fee because we only wanted a slice of cake. Was able to order one and waited for around 15 min (longer than expected though). We got the chocolate cake cheesecake and it was around $10. It is a bit pricey but comparable to the US prices in Buffalo. My husband and I split the cheesecake and it was still very filling and tasty. Very fresh cake, with soft spongy layers and creamy layers of cream cheese. The whipped cream is also very fresh. Overall, it was a good piece of cake albeit being quite pricey."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on or if this place has a new cook, but I ordered the salmon tonight and the whole filet was undercooked.  I ordered it to go so
I had to finish cooking it myself.  I ordered food a few weeks ago and I probably had 2 small pieces of chicken in my tomato basil pasta.  For the amount of money these dishes cost, I would expect to have cooked food and larger portions.  I'm going to take a break from this place for a while until they get it together!"}
{"text":"This is the worsen place I ever been waited 30 mins for a table at 9 pm on a Monday night the service was crappy  l. I ordered a grilled chicken Cobb salad chicken was cold and  waited like almost 30 mins for salad. By the time the food came I didn't want it cause the party of 4 I came with to eat was done with there food. I will never come here ever again food is over priced and over rated. Only good thing was my White Russian and the over priced small price of cheese cake. Then the manager didn't even comp our ticket or any thing. Not that I'm cheep out of being a good business to make some one want to come back if your ever in South Park Charlotte don't come here.   This place is terrible waste of money and didn't enjoy crap at least I had a hour drive home and a new Mac Pro to play with"}
{"text":"As we walked in, the front desk staff was very friendly and we only had to wait about 3 minutes to get sat outside. 

Our waitress came to the table quickly and right away offered to tell us the specials. We alerted her immediately that we were there to enjoy dessert. I was in the mood for a piece of cheesecake and when I saw they had a pineapple upside down one on their menu, the decision was made. 

Unfortunately, the pineapple upside down cheesecake was all gone which left me having to decide on another dessert. I chose the strawberry shortcake. However, when it arrived I was very disappointed. The shortcake was very hard and cold, not fresh whatsoever. On the top of the shortcake their was a sugar crust made with raw sugar. The strawberries were the best thing about this dessert. 

I won't be going back, but if you do - good luck, this place is hit and miss."}
{"text":"1 hour wait today, be patient.  Strawberry Lemonade is always good!  Little crab cakes as app. is a must try.  Hibachi Steak is fantastic and my favorite.  Headed home with fresh strawberry cheesecake.  Small groups are better on the weekends."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience, food and service. I like the spread of food selection they offer.  But, still the quality of food is not compromised."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. I ordered from the Skinny menu and my dining companion ordered from the regular menu. The food was below mediocre. Each of us had pasta and the pasta was cold and stuck together. I had shrimp (five of them) with my pasta and it tasted as though it may have been cooked yesterday. The server was okay, but he delivered our entrees at different times. Perhaps my pasta wasn't cold and sticky enough yet. Forty dollars for no-so-good two entrees and one drink is also a bit pricey, but I guess the marketing must be paid for as it seems they aren't spending good money on food product. Too pricey for less than mediocre and truth be told, if the bill were only twenty dollars, it would still not be worth the quality of food delivered to us - at separate time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The place has a wonderful set up inside with beautiful decor everywhere. The servers are welcoming and know everything there is to know about the menu when you have questions. The food is to-die for. They make their own food, fresh, every day. Their menu is massive and they have a substantial amount of cheesecake to choose from. If you can't tell, this is one of my favorite restaurants to go to. It can get a little pricey but it's worth it. Don't forget about their happy hour where you can find good deals on drinks and appetizers!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this Cheesecake Factory 10 stars. 

Here's why: my sister can't have gluten or black pepper. Yep, I know. That sucks. BUT, this Cheesecake Factory made that issue 100x easier. Their management came by our table and showed my sister exactly what she could eat and what they could substitute/take out. If they didn't know, they would contact the chef. 

THAT. IS. AWESOME. 

And they didn't ever make my sister feel bad or show any signs of irritation when she had questions. 

Also, everyone at our table loved what they ordered. BRAVO."}
{"text":"I have iterally been counting down the days until I got to visit this location. I frequent the cheesecake factory anytime I get a chance when I'm in the states so to have one soo much closer to home makes me ecstatic beyond belief.
 Hubby and I came on a Saturday afternoon just before 3pm and we already had the mindset that the wait would be long. Don't think you can just waltz on into this place and snag a table... there is Always a wait. The line to get the buzzer to alert when your table is ready is usually so long that they split it in half (one half in the centre of the mall and then your guided to another line immediately outside the restaurant entrance to get the buzzer where you have to wait again. Once you receive the buzzer it was a 2 to 2.5hr wait at that point. Your are also restricted to where you can go with the buzzer. I think the jurisdiction is between shoppers drugmart and the bay. If you go outside the area the buzzer won't go off and you will miss your alert. Luckily we were saved by an Angel named Ashley who decided to eat at the bar and gave us her buzzer and she had only 30 mins left to wait. Talk about a score!!!
 From there we went inside the restaurant to the hostess desk to wait where they collect the buzzers and seat you. We only ended up waiting 15 more minutes and then were seated. The hostess lead us to a cozy table for two at the end of a banquet in the centre row at the back section of the restaurant.
 Our waitress was soo friendly and upbeat she came over introduced herself and took our drink orders and gave us time to peruse the colossal menu. The menu really has something to please any appetite. I always try to get something different everytime I come. We really had a hard a time deciding what to eat with all the options. The lady at the table beside us had ordered some sort of steak dish and both hubby and I were eying it. I had to ask her what it was and we both ended up ordering it.
 So onto the food
For appetizer I knew for sure what I wanted to get
Avocado Egg Rolls- Avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper and served with a tamarind cashew dipping sauce
First of all I love avocados so this was right up my alley! There were huge chunks of creamy avocados in this contrasted in that super crunchy wrapper and dipped in that sweet and tangy tamarind sauce it was just the perfect bite! 
 For entrees we both ordered the 
Grilled Steak Medallions -Served with fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, sautéed cherry tomatoes, crusted croutons, mashed potatoes, and Madeira wine sauce
Our steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare, well seasoned and tender. They were adorned with a crunchy crouton breadcrumb topping which was something I never had on a steak but I enjoyed the different textures. The mashed potatoes were deliciously buttery in taste and I enjoyed swiping every bite through that delicious wine sauce. 
 Finally onto dessert. So I never deviate from my dessert choice when visiting the cheesecake factory because basically I'm obsessed with this cake it's just soo good!
Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - Chunks of Reese's peanut butter cups in original cheesecake with layers of delicious fudge cake and caramel
Just OMG I love this cake sooo much it would be part of my last meal! If you love peanut butter and chocolate this one is for you! I just adore all the distinct different layers in this cake as it begins with the Reese's cheesecake followed by a layer of caramel studded with crunchy peanuts than that fudgey chocolate cake and then a rich peanut butter layer in the middle then everything repeated again covered in fudge and chocolate curls and topped with a peanut butter swirl It's to die for!!
 So I have to say overall I had a wonderful experience at Canada's 1st cheesecake factory! I really have to commened the staff here as despite the chaotic crowds, hoards of patrons, and just the crazy business of it all everyone I encountered was happy and cheerful and willing to help. Food came out in a really timely manner, everything was delicious from start to finish, portions are massive here as are the cheesecake slices, and service was surprisingly great. Hopefully they start taking reservations soon because I'm already dreaming of my repeat visit!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour ! We ordered cheesy garlic bread, chicken sliders , avocado rolls and cosmos.  Everything so good.  Great service fresh great food.  Party of three we had lots of fun!  Last we ordered cheesecake banana cream cheesecake yum so good."}
{"text":"Loved loved this place...i went mainly for cheesecake. Had the original strawberry cheescake. loved every bit of it. Located at fancy big mall in charllote. The wait to get seated takes long but u can waste time browsing through the stores at the mall. They do not take reservations during holidays like today 1st Jan 2015 very busy"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! They truly care about their guests and we had a wonderful time! I really like the hosts they are always so nice and remember me and my family every time we come in. This is a great place for any occasion and if you don't like many crowds it's best between 11-1!"}
{"text":"I don't get what the hype is over this place I tried it I did not like the cheesecake i had a peanut butter Reese's cheesecake and the wait time sucks on top of that when I had the cheese cake there was a piece on paper in the cheesecake bad overhyped not worth it but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"One of my very very favorite places to eat, like, ever. Everything you eat is quality made, and delicious. 
Now, I admit, not all their food is what I call accurate - I hear that, say, they serve edamame with butter - but regardless of what you order, it's good. If you want more accurate food, go to a different restaurant. 
But, on that note, I will say that these guys have THE BEST Shepherd's Pie outside of England. I kid you not - went there a few years ago, fell in love with real shepherd's pie, and haven't been able to find any here until I came to this place. It's real and amazing and perfect.
Also, I have to throw in a recommendation for the vanilla bean cheesecake. They have so many, if you ever can't decide, go vanilla bean. Tasty, not too sweet, not too rich, great way to end a meal.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Y'all. This cheesecake at this location is my favorite. I don't even know which one to rank. They're all SO GOOD. My bf and I were craving their carrot cake cheesecake one night so we went to the CF and got 3 different flavors. The chocolate coffee one I don't even remember the name, was so good I wept. It was like literally angels came down from heaven and handcrafted the cheesecake for my tastebuds. Next was the carrot cake one, same thing.. literal angels came down from heaven and handcrafted it. The last one was the Reese's one which was just as good. I can't even. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 100/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"My husband &&I eat here at least 3 times a month. Often catch Floyd Mayweather &&his \"money team\". The service is exceptional. One night I guess a server dropped my husbands filet mignon &&the manager came to apologize comped his plate &&offered us a free slice of cheesecake. We're not dessert eaters so we took the comp gladly. If you go later in the night, like two hours before closing, there's usually no wait."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory has been around along time and so have I. The first time I ate at a Cheesecake Factory was in Marina Del Ray many years ago. I was with a group and waited 2 hours. Today things are not much better at the Boca Park location so I basically stopped going. No place is worth waiting for over 30 minuets and that's too long. I know they serve huge portions and you definitely pay for it, but who really needs so much?  Not me...I must say some of the options are quite tasty, but it's definitely not the place to go if you don't eat large portions or like me bring home a doggie bag that lasts 2 days
The cheese cake is excellent and sometimes you wait 30 minuets or more just to order cheesecake at the cheesecake counter. 
Sorry, no matter how good the restaurant is, I will not wait over 15 minuets with an extra 5 minute buffer."}
{"text":"mmm yummy cheesecake and yummy food. friendly staff and great options for food. beautiful restaurant as well."}
{"text":"When Cheesecake introduced their monstrosity to the Biltmore years ago, I was turned off by breathless staff pushing drinks and skimpy desserts, and by longer waits than a GP's office in flu season. But I have to say that, over time, I've warmed to this conglomerate - even as I subsequentyly learned that eating here regularly might kill me.    

The staff has settled in and mostly toned it down, and now our entire family revolves through CF's front door with confidence, and suspiciously early for dinner, to avoid waiting room rigor mortis.  Overall food preparation is at least one notch below Houston's across the street and one notch above adjacent CPK, which is more impressive than it sounds considering the legendary breadth of Cheesecake's menu.   

It's all respectably prepared, if fattening, and often quite good.  I like the fish tacos (standard fish but massive fixins) and the portabella and asparagus omelette. Mom gravitates towards sublime corn tamale cakes, and Chris is seduced by a salad presented in two huge conical mounds he likes to call \"Dolly Parton\".  

There's an item or two on this menu to pique anyone's interest, and while the Factory probably wont serve up your best meal ever (unless you dont get out much), a truly disappointing meal here is rarer than Steak tartare. Portions are large and we almost always pass on dessert. 

Not the kind of restaurant to whip out an engagement ring in (this is a Factory, after all), but a safe choice for the family, stargazing (Suns opponents staying at the Ritz eat here all the time), or a pre-movie dinner date. Well, safe until you die."}
{"text":"This has been me and my best friends spot to go every year for our Christmas exchange. During holidays and dinner you can almost guarantee you'll be waiting for a little bit. 

The service is okay. Sometimes it's great and other times your server is no where to be found ,but with the high amount of traffic and the numerous times I've been back it's safe to say it's good enough service to keep people coming back. 

I usually get the chicken crusted Romano, but have tried numerous things on their menu from the miso salmon to their many cheesecakes. The portions are pretty big because every time I dine here I always have to ask for a to go box."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying the Cheesecake Factory with my family for many years, mostly in California. We tried this one today since we now live in Summerlin Las Vegas and were quite disappointed. Service was very slow. Waitress was very unpleasant, snappy, and unfriendly .  Is it so difficult to smile?  At the end she just threw the bill on the table and then grabbed my credit card out of my hand instead of using the small black folder that every other waitress was using, then came back with that black folder in one hand- empty!- and my credit card in her other hand...it was weird"}
