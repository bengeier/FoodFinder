{"text":"I had a great dinner at Avocado. Not surprisingly, the restaurant is decorated in avocado green and an orange-red.  There's a barely visible TV projected onto a wall and unfortunately, the tables for two are too small. There is room for bigger tables though, so I'm unclear on the thinking behind the small tables. And even though it was quite hot outside, the air-conditioning inside left me wishing I had brought a sweater. The food, however, was excellent. I had the Loco Quesadilla stuffed with jalape√±os, black beans, kidney beans, corn salsa, black olives, aged white cheddar and chicken with sweet potato fries on the side. It was very, very good and those were probably the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. A very tasty lime margarita complemented the meal. And very good service completed the dining experience."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and doesn't over-rely on things like cheese and sour cream to make it taste good. The menu is fairly short - but everything we've had on it has been great. The restaurant has a grown-up feel, but they don't bat and eye when we've taken our 2 year old. I really like the kids menu as it has kid sized options of adult food instead of burgers and pizza. They do have a cheese quesadilla option that should satisfy most, if not all picky kids."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service isn't amazing but the food is really good. It is a nice sit down place for mexican food and they have some creative dishes. The dishes are a bit more expensive than some other Mexican restaurant but they are relative to the quality of food and classy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were at Costco and The Brick and we up for trying out a new restaurant for a late lunch.  I have been in Mexican restaurants all over Mexico, California, and western Canada and love authentic Mexican food.  When we saw Avocado Mexican Grill, we thought it worth a try.  It wasn't.

SHORT DESCRIPTION:  Food BLAND, dry, and tasteless, and overpriced, poor value for the money. 

They charged $3.50 for the tiniest little cup of tortilla chips and salsa (most Mexican restaurants provide that for free with a full meal).  My friend ordered the fish tacos, which were deep fried and bland.  I thought I would get a taste of authentic carnitas when I ordered the pork burrito.  It was dry and tasteless.  No Mexican spices, no cilantro.  There is nothing authentically Mexican about this restaurant.  Even Taco Bell comes closer (and that isn't saying much). The tortillas, chips, and salsa were like something bought from Safeway. 

Our table for two was so small that there wasn't sufficient room for our plates, drinks, chips, etc. 

They really should take the word \"Mexican\" off their restaurant name.  Nothing Mexican about this restaurant.  Doesn't even come close."}
{"text":"Went to Avocado for the first time on a Friday afternoon. We went early, 4:30 as to wait out rush hour traffic. I had a steak sandwich, my kids both
Ordered grilled cheese sandwiches off  the kids menu. My wife had a chicken taco salad. The food was okay, the service was slow. We were the only table eating, so I think the service could've been a lot better."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this restaurant a better rating.  I had phoned to talk to them about the ratings they were receiving and they promised me that they had made a lot of changes and that things were much better now.  I think the problem is that they just don't have enough flavor in their recipes.  I had a chicken something or other that was like a roll-up and it was okay but nothing that would ever make me order it again.  My friend had a salad and she said it was okay.  

I have to agree with the other visitors to the restaurant in that the servers come to the table to check too many times.  We'd be in the middle of a conversation and they would stand there and then interrupt and ask if we're doing okay.  That happened at least five times.   I wish they would take a look at the situation, see that there is conversation happening, and approach at a more appropriate time. 

I think that they should offer a small version of their chips and salsa so one doesn't have to pay over $6 for that sort of thing.  We would have liked a snack while waiting for our meals but didn't want the added expense of taco chips and salsa that is never worth that much anywhere. 

I really doubt I'll return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"A great place with good food everytime.  Don't be fooled by the restaurant name though, it is definately not a mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in here today for lunch with my sister. I wasn't too thrilled with the place.  I had been in here once before a couple of years ago and remember I didn't like it back then either, but thought maybe it would be better.  I walked in and the place was busy and my sister was already there.  The decor of this place is definitely not Mexican which would be ok if the food was Mexican.  Sure they have mexican items on the menu, but both times I have eaten here I have thought  I could make my own at home better.  I had the vegetarian burrito that came with a side salad.  The burrito had lots of nice fresh vegetables - but amazing there was nothing remotely mexican - no salsa - no guac- no sour cream- no beans - it was just vegetables and some jalapeno peppers.  The salad was a mix of baby greens and some kind of creamy dressing - it had the taste of something more french than mexican.  

The decor is dark, and in my opinion completely underwhelming. Our server was nice . One of my pet peeves happened here a beverage; ( in my case a diet coke ) with a glass that is three quarters filled with ice. Drives me nuts.  Considering the low food cost of fountain pop - cut back on the ice a bit.  I ordered my next one with no ice. 

This place must do ok though, the real estate down at Deerfoot Meadows must not be cheap and they have been there for a couple of years.  If i want good Mexican I will go to Salt and Pepper."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for food that isn't too exciting, if you can't get people that grew up eating Mexican food to come here, you know that the best it can be is subpar. The one time I went here I ordered their take on the bean burrito. It was ok and I didn't see any suspicious activity that occured during the meal experience, but it wasn't that impressive for me to rave about the meal to anyone I know, let alone Yelp.

yeah thats right YELP, I ate at Avocado...BEAM with jealously!

see? not much to sell."}
{"text":"Expensive, mediocre, no real Mexican food - no enchiladas! Stay away!"}
{"text":"The decor and service in Avocado is great!  The food i enjoy as well.  I have tried a number of dishes there, including burritos, soups and most of the appetizers.  The food is pretty consistent as well.  You can count on the fact that if you liked a dish last time, it will be good this time as well."}
{"text":"This sums up my recent visit to Avacado: Bad food - overpriced, Bad service, Bad experience.

For the extended whiny version, please see below:

After a quick trip to IKEA left us famished, we decided we needed some decent grub. Avocado was right there, enticing us with promises of fresh Mexican food. We would regret it.

We were quickly seated and given menus, but then it took a full twenty minutes to take our drink orders. It was pretty early but the place was surprisingly full (not packed). There weren't that many items on the menu, but we quickly decided on: the calamari, the sweet potato fries, the chicken burrito and the shrimp taco. 

Nearly half an hour after we had arrived, and twenty minutes after we had decided our order was taken. The kitchen didn't take long, so we got our food within about ten minutes. It was... interesting. The chicken burrito was massive, bland and difficult to bite into or to cut with the knife and fork. The shrimp taco was the best dish, ringing in at mediocre. The fries were delicious, but the kitchen was unable to procure plain mayonnaise as a side. What kind of kitchen doesn't have plain mayonnaise?! The calamari was tiny, and about half the size it should have been considering the price. It had also been overcooked. All of this food was ridiculously overpriced, considering both the quality and the size.

We then sat around for a goodly while waiting for our dishes to be taken, and when the waitress finally got around to bringing the bill she brought the wrong one. 

Considering the place emptied out shortly after we got there, our service was atrociously bad. We were basically ignored and we barely even saw our server. Obviously that level of service is standard at Avocado, because the bar manager was on his laptop at the bar in full view of all the patrons. 

Three strikes and Avocado's out."}
{"text":"I like eating here when I am in Deerfoot Meadows. It's not deep fried (unless you want that) and it's filling. I love the Pesole soup, it's $5.00 and it's tasty with peppers, tomatoes, beans, corn and tortilla strips. I asked for the recipe, but apparently they bring it in from elsewhere. I wish it was available in a larger size, as it is only available in appetizer size right now.

My roommate always has the Copper Canyon Quesadilla with yam fries and aioli. It has chicken and cheese and fills him up. I don't like their refried beans, they seem hard and either old or canned, I can't tell. 

Burritos are huge and seem to be ideal for sharing. The dessert menu looked tasty, but I haven't tried any. Staff are attentive and debit is available tableside.

For a quick lunch that isn't fast food, it's a good stop. It's also family friendly :)"}
{"text":"This is NOT the place if you are looking for real Mexican food & real Mexican experience. My pregnant friend and I were running errands in the complex and she suddenly craved Mexican food and wanted it NOW!!! I do not mess with a pregnant lady's cravings so we hurried over here for lunch.

This is more of a fusion Mexican place.  I Wasn't greeted with fresh hot tortilla chips & fresh yummy salsa, or a lady standing behind a glass partition making fresh handmade tortillas.  I don't even know if that exists in Calgary but gosh darnit, someone should open a place like that here. ;-)

As in the later part of the name, it's aiming for a trendy loungey feel - too bad cuz  it'd be nicer if it was warm, cozy, and comfortable. The inside is kind of bare with a dark color palate.  When walking in, I had expected to be hit with the aromatic fumes of Mexican food but again was let down.  I even questioned if we had walked into the right restaurant!  

It was sooo uneventful that I don't remember much from my lunch ...but
I do remember that it took a LONG time to get our food & that I ordered a bowl of tortilla soup on the side which was expensive for the tiny little bowl. 

My prego friend was satisfied so I guess it was 'mission accomplished'."}
{"text":"\"Restaurant\" is not an appropriate term to define Avocado. It is just an okayish lunch spot, safe enough to grab something on the run or maybe stay for a bit without any further memories.

Food quality is a food court level, but with higher price tag. Waiters are mostly young folks who don't look like being a server is their dream career. Decor is sort of cheap and trendy, and tables are not sticky - yet environment doesn't look quite inviting. Barely clean enough.

If you are staying in a nearby hotel or work in a nearby office, I'd suggest to call and order your food in advance, it takes a bit to get it ready. Parking next to Avocado is always full, so you'd rather leave your car on a general parking in front.

Other than that, nothing special to recommend or warn about."}
{"text":"Burritos are sub par, expensive and small. I am skewed in my tastes because I have been spoiled with true taquerias in my life. For lunch, I have yet to find a great spot in the SE with a decent sized burrito for under $10. If you find one message me!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food but my boyfriend suggested we eat here for lunch one day so that we can try something new.  When we entered the restaurant we weren't greeted right away so we took that time to scope out the place and where we would like to sit (there were many seats open).  When the server came to seat us we asked for a particular table because it was against the window and set of two.  She was snotty about it because she was supposed to seat us in another section.  After about a minute or so of going back and forth with her about where we would sit, she stomped over to the table we wanted and threw down the menus.  We were a little shocked with her attitude but decided to eat anyway.

Now onto the good part of our meal.  The waitress that served us was very nice and knowledgeable.  As I said I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican so she put in a special order for me and it came out perfect.  We had a delicious meal that was very filling.  The place is a little pricey and it came to $36 for two people but the food was good and the our actual server was awesome."}
