{"text":"This tapas restaurant is a quaint little bistro in the West island. All their products are imported from Spain. They have an extensive menu of different chacuteries, cheeses, olives and small plates. We were a group of 7 people and all our dishes were excellent. The seafood, the pinxtos, the cheese, breads and especially the sangria! The only issue was they were not able to accommodate a vegetarian Celiac even though they said it would not be a problem when I reserved over the phone. A plate came with bread on it and a vegetable paella tasted like seafood. The staff did apologize as we paid our bill but said they weren't aware of the allergy when we had mentioned it several times during the meal and over the phone when I reserved. Great restaurant but customers with allergeries may want to avoid."}
{"text":"This tapas restaurant is an exceptional gem tucked in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. The variety of dishes available is excellent, the quality of the food is unmatched by any other tapas restaurant I have been to, and the service is wonderful. The owners, Margo and Francisco, are stellar hosts that welcomed me with open arms and made me feel at home. The menu is extensive and contains all the classic Spanish dishes from chorizo to paella, from croquettes to Galician octopus. If you are not sure what to get, Margo can help you find the perfect choices to fulfil whatever craving you may be having. The food is flavorful, fresh, and prepared to perfection. And their sangria is unrivalled! Ole Tapas is an authentic, amazing, and exquisite find in the West Island."}
