{"text":"When we first got to the restaurant it was extremely crowded due to happy hour. The drinks were great and service at the bar was quick, but getting a table proved really difficult. We waited for almost an hour and a half to be seated. At the bar we ordered the soft tacos which were extremely delicious. All the ingredients tasted extremely fresh, which created a unique twist to the normal Tex Mex cuisine one would expect. The rice was absolutely to die for! Will definitely make an effort to go back and try brunch."}
{"text":"2 stars but only because I'm still reeling from my tequila sunset. I've been here twice now & have yet to have a satisfactory review. The first time, I ordered the pork nachos & found myself munching on bones. Disgusting. Rather than take them off our bill, they gave us drink coupons for a future visit. Umm. I wasn't impressed the first time, an now you want me to come back? By the way, the margaritas were weak.  So I ended up coming back over a year later for a work brunch thing. The service was mediocre at best, granted we had a fairly large party - but with a reservation - so they could have been prepared. Hubbo ordered a breakfast margarita & it was horrible so he traded it in for a tap beer. I ordered smoked enchiladas. It was about 80% beans & 20% two of the smallest enchiladas I've ever had. Again, to make up for service, waitress brought by  EXPIRED drink coupons. Way to win me over El Dorado..."}
{"text":"Eldorado is perhaps my favorite brunch place in Madison. In general, I'm a big fan of the go with a few other food-loving people, order as many items as you think you can handle, and try them all. This feels like the only tactic to use at Eldorado, because it's all soooo good. First, a little booze: Eldorado has a slate of flavorful Bloody Mary-like drinks that you can order with chili infused vodka or tequila. If you want a kick in the morning, go that route. If you want something strong and sweet, I'd recommend the tequila sunrise. Yum.  For savory options: If you're looking for something classically Tex-Mex, you can't go wrong with the chilaquiles. Fried tortillas, eggs, salsa, beans, cheese, it's all there. If you want something more Tex and less Mex, the Texas Two Step is a good (and filling) choice. One huge biscuit split in half with one side covered in a sausage patty and gravy and the other paired with eggs and thick, smoky bacon. The Two Step will make you want to nap for a while, but you will enjoy every bite.  As for sweets: Let's just say this right away: Eldorado's French toast is probably the best in the city. Not overly eggy, not soggy. It's sweet and covered in cinnamon and it's CRUNCHY! They use a secret ingredient (which I won't spoil here, but ask the right waitperson and they'll clue you in) to keep the French toast interesting. It's fantastic. Aside from that, their blue corn flapjack is a star. Served with red chili butter and maple syrup, it is fluffy and flavorful.  Overall, Eldorado really excels at doing brunch. Just be prepared to feel stuffed and maybe plan in advance to include a siesta in your day."}
{"text":"Eldorado is consistently great! The margaritas are hands-down the best in Madison.  The salsa is really good too - wish they would jar it.  The steak with the collard greens and blue cheese butter is amazing.  Last time I tried the corn quesadilla.  This is no ordinary quesadilla - I've been thinking about it ever since I had it.  Service is great.  I've been eating here for years and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Two words: Rip. Off.   Everything here is overpriced in an otherwise reasonably priced city. $12 for only two chorizo tacos?! You must be kidding. They were good, but not worth the price. I realize I've got it good living in a city where there are Mexicans, but there is simply no reason to gouge customers for mediocre food. The standard sides are black beans and rice. The black beans were bland, the rice forgettable. I substituted the collard greens and corn cakes, which were also unimpressive, unless you just want straight-up collard greens cooked a bit on the flattop with nothing else added. What's the matter Eldorado Grill? Afraid dairy-loving Sconnies can't stand the taste of Flavor?   I had a tasty, spicy tequila drink backed up with a bottle of Tecate, so it wasn't a complete loss..."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Eldorado in a while, mostly because I lumped it in with its FoodFight brethren in the category of \"Generally meh.\"  I was totally wrong.   While there's still the FoodFight hallmark of style over substance, our entrees were interesting and excellent. Our server was outstanding with very friendly explanations, attentive refills of things and an overall nice pacing.  Very nicely done, y'all!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great drinks but when it come to food.. let's just say Meh is the best I can say. Sorry I don't buy into free chips and salsa. Disclaimer we went their for brunch(not dinner)"}
{"text":"No free chips and salsa? You cannot brand yourself as Tex-Mex without this. It's a rite of passage. Queso? That's not queso. Don't order it. It's melted cheese on chips. No frozen margaritas? What nonsense is that? At least it's tasty. Those three things make this restaurant a no-go for Tex-Mex authenticity.  Those little mishaps aside, El Dorado has some charm. As far as Tex-Mex (food) in Madison goes, this place is pretty solid. I wouldn't say it's great, but I understand the appeal. The food is tasty, but as a native Texan, I crave chips and salsa, queso, and frozen margaritas. Step your game up, El Dorado.  As for the food, I had the spinach mushroom enchiladas, and they were delicious. The ingredients are fresh and well-cooked, and the presentation is spot-on. The margaritas were also tasty, but too many things threw me off about the restaurant for it to be one of my favorites in Madison.  Overall, I enjoyed the food, but it wasn't the experience I was hoping for. If they had branded themselves as a modern Mexican joint, I think I would have been pleasantly surprised, but by labeling themselves as Tex-Mex, they set themselves up for failure in my eyes (and mouth).   I heard the brunch is great, but I'm not too motivated to try it out."}
{"text":"Great food and nice ambience! Friendly staff and quick service! Their Corn pancakes are the best, and very filling!!"}
{"text":"Simple enough: food is good, service mediocre to bad.   Details: El Dorado Benedict is delicious, and the waffles too, especially with fruit. Service is uniformly slow. Wait staff might see you once at most in the 40-60 minutes between placing your order and receiving your food. Look forward to another ten minutes just waiting for someone to run your card. Nary an apology or word of concern for the wait. Wait staff aren't overtly rude; they just don't seem to give a rat's ass about you or notice that you're there. This is not a one-time opinion -- I've been there 4 times for brunch (the food is worth the trip); each time the service has been the same, across multiple servers and times. A shame, since their menu is wonderful. Their management would do well to add some cooks, change their waiters, or both.   In summary, go for a leisurely and tasty brunch, but make sure you enjoy your company, because you'll be chatting with them for a long long time."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here, this time just for drinks. They have a fabulous selection of tequila and served in different volumes so you can try truly excellent tequila at an affordable price. Our server was super helpful and nice to chat with. I keep meaning to get here for brunch (last dinner was excellent) - one day we'll make it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, with many different menu options.  Their chips are served warm, and so light and crispy it's hard to stop eating them. I've tried the enchiladas, as well as the quinoa stuffed poblano. Both items were good, but I wish they were spicier (then again, I like my food pretty spicy). If you save room for dessert try the chocolate ancho pecan pie - delicious!"}
{"text":"If you like jalapenos wrapped in bacon and top-notch margaritas, this is the place for you. The atmosphere is cozy but not cramped and the menu gives you plenty of options. It is a bit overpriced in my opinion, but the quality dishes and friendly service make up for it."}
{"text":"I had the chicken enchiladas around 13$. Were a bit dry w/ the verde sauce but I did prefer that over the mole. Used the yelp deal of free chips/salsa.  I had a finer honey margarita that was STRONG! I wasn't able to finish it:("}
{"text":"The menu at the Eldorado offers a wide-range of dishes to choose from which left us excited from the start. Our table went with the fish tacos, the pork adobo, chicken enchiladas, and the spinach and cheese enchiladas. Of these dishes the best, in terms of flavor, was the pork adobo. This dish offered chunks of pork, onions, and other vegetables in a hearty mole sauce. The fish tacos were just kind of bland. Two at our table ordered this entree and both said, \"They were just okay. We've had better.\" Both diners who ordered the enchiladas simply said their dishes were okay. There seemed to be an overall lack of flavor across the board in the entree dishes, as well as the salsa served with the chips and salsa basket to start. (Free with our Yelp check-in.) Our service was good. We made a reservation and were seated on time. Drinks were good and refilled quickly. Noise level was high due to the tall, open industrial-look ceilings."}
{"text":"Great dinner here during restaurant week. Margaritas are awesome!! The pulled pork and enchiladas were amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best margarita and chicken and mushroom burrito I have ever had. The appetizers where great too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the place you want. Go here. You won't regret it.   This instantly landed a firm spot in my all-time favorite restaurants.  A group of us came here on a whim for Sunday brunch, and luckily only had to wait 30-40 minutes. My cohorts ordered the most glorious looking, fully loaded Bloody Marys. I was nursing a hangover that even hair of the dog couldn't cure, so I stuck with OJ, but I would definitely make the 3 hour drive again just to order one. Stuffed olives, peppers, pickles, oh my.   The entire menu looked appetizing. No really, the entire thing. And I'm a picky eater. I eventually went with the Gringo Burrito.. wait for it... AND the french toast. Two full-sized entrees. The burrito was huge: stuffed with all kinds of veggie/ meaty/ potato-y magic and other stuff I don't remember because I was in food ecstasy. Then topped with a green sauce that blew my mind. The french toast was thick and sweet, made with vanilla and cinnamon crispy goodness, I didn't even use maple syrup it was so flavorful.  I had about a quarter of the burrito and two slices of the french toast left that I boxed up for my long drive home, and you can bet it was gone inside my 50 mile mark.   This astronomical food brought me back to life after a weekend of sin juice & mayhem, this is true, but I will absolutely be making more visits here in the future. So incredibly good."}
{"text":"Not disappointing. Start with some tequila - your knowledgable server will steer you in the direction of a taste sensation. Their special margaritas are pretty darn swell too (e.g. there was a spicy specialty that darn if I can't remember the name now). The pork dishes are just great (smoked pulled pork, Machaca burrito). I ventured out for the catfish this visit and really liked it - not overly blackened, just spiced and tasty with pickled red onions. The spinach and mushroom enchiladas were had by the wife - simply delicious mushrooms with verde salsa.  Good service. Only suggestion - give a guy some chips on the house. No kids menu but they will make smaller quesadillas, etc."}
{"text":"Over priced, food was less than fair tasting. Only positive, pretty plate. I wouldn't come back or order Mexican food from here but I may try the BBQ if I had to come back."}
{"text":"One of my top spots in Madison for a spicy margarita. Top pick is the blazing saddle, smoking gun in a close second. Also, the Texas torpedoes are killer."}
{"text":"Have had brunch here twice with my girlfriend.  It was busier on Sunday than it was Saturday, but we sat at the bar both times and got seated almost right away.  The service was really good, friendly bartenders, and the food came out quickly.  She really likes the Bloody Marias.  The blue corn pancakes are really good and we enjoyed everything we have gotten so far.  Great place for brunch, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Possibly the best happy hour I've ever experienced. Got 3 happy hour apps, my wife and I were totally full...epinadas and tacos were mind blowing. Margaritas were great, and dirt cheap. Our server Ryan was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Deciding to eat early we had our choice of seating and choose a window side booth.  Starting with an order of chips that included three styles of dipping sauces.  Our favorite, which seems to be the favorite of others, was the very tasty and very spicy pineapple jalapeño dip.  Our waitress offered more dip as we soaked it all up with the light chips.   My wife ordered the street tacos which were small, simple, but tasty.  I ordered the slow-braised Pork Adobo which had tasty pieces of pork with red rice in a delicious dark mushroom sauce topped with fresh avocado.  I should have ordered it extra spicy.   This great Mexican food dinner was complemented by outstanding tequila margarita that was served on ice, but was NOT water downed as you might normally expect.       We were very happy with the great service and high food quality.  I don't think anything on the menu would be a bad choice. Ask your server what the regulars normally order if you are not sure.  We come from southern California where the Mexican food is top notch and plentiful.  If I may add.......this establishment in Madison does it right."}
{"text":"Thank you for ruining my birthday. I've been looking forward to brunch all week to celebrate my birthday. We got there at 9:00 and were promptly seated. After waiting 1 hr for our food and watching a table for 8 that came after us get food, drinks and more food, our food came.....,ice cold. my husband was furious and , even though the manager apologized and offered free food, walked out. An apology just doesn't cut it when a person is that angry. What is happening to the food fight restaurants? This is the second time we've been to the food fight chain this summer and the second same exact experience."}
{"text":"Chicken enchiladas were nearly inedible--corn tortillas were thin and stiff with bone-dry macerated chicken. (Seafood enchilada was similarly terrible, and expensive). Beans were bland and rice overcooked.  Tenderloin was decent, and chef's tacos were ok, they managed to rise above bland.  A 30 minute wait turned into 1.5 hours-- ok due to busy night, but we could have done without the snark when the friend we were supposed to meet after dinner stopped by and had a drink at the empty seat at our table. (More snark after asking server's whereabouts even though we were sitting with dry drinks for 20 min)  Bartender was a single bright spot. He was efficient and friendly. Margaritas were pretty good, too.  Overall, the dinner took 3 painful hours."}
{"text":"Come here for Brunch! Order the Huevos Rancheros.  I've eaten here for dinner and must say I was not impressed, but the Saturday and Sunday brunch is phenomenal--I rate it best in Madison. The Huevos Rancheros are the best I have ever eaten. (I tend to try huevos rancheros wherever I go and few can compare). Also exceptional--the biscuits and gravy, and the bacon.   Note this brunch that I highly recommend is not a buffet style brunch, but everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Nice staff, in spite of having to listen to the owner-or-whoevers stupid self-produced \"country\" music all night. That didn't help the dining experience much at all; I was annoyed after 15 minutes, I can't imagine having to listen to that all the time. The walk home through the silent construction dinosaurs on Willy street at night was more interesting than the food."}
{"text":"Ok, I've tried this place several times over some years, and we went back two nights  ago. The drinks were good, and we've had decent appetizers in the bar before.  But for dinner - not so good.  I had seafood enchiladas - 18.95 for three thin tubes of crispy tortilla filled with some sort of seafood paste.  Served with a side of unseasoned black beans and rice.  No salad, no vegetable, and they charge extra for chips and salsa. My husbands chicken enchilada mole was slightly more generous, but still very mediocre.  Painted with mole, but dry.  The food there is very conceptual - it looks pretty but doesn't taste good. So, I would stick to the drinks and appetizers.  My theory as to why they are busy - one of the few places in the neighborhood with parking."}
{"text":"The service was really great, don't be afraid to ask the waiters for recommendations. Also with the free chips and salsa they are very generous with the amount of chips it'll be plenty for four people!  Baja fish tacos: a very recommended dish at this place and very tasty! I'd recommend getting the mahi mahi blackened instead of fried because it really enhances the flavors. The beans and rice are fairly average but always a good side. Pasilla chicken enchilada: can get it with verde or mole sauce. The verde was very flavorful and the chicken was great. Again, it was just fairly average but still good.   One plus is that they offer vegan options, vegetarian options, and gluten free options so they are very versatile."}
{"text":"Unique breakfast menu but I'm never blown away by my experience here. The last time I was there I ordered their eggs Benedict and my eggs were poached completely hard, I asked for runny eggs. When I asked the waitress to bring me new eggs she was very sassy about it. The next batch of eggs she brought out were also hard, after asking for yet another set of eggs I finally got runny eggs on my third try.   Its a shame because the menu always sounds so good to me!"}
{"text":"Eldorado Grill first came on our radar when we tried their Texas torpedos at Taste of Madison. While there's not much new about a bacon wrapped jalapeno popper, their addition of shrimp and the just-right amount of cheese caught our attention. Our two visits to the restaurant since then have both been solid. My spice loving husband is a huge fan of the pork adobo, which although it is offered extra spicy, he finds the heat sufficient in the original preparation. The guacamole chalupas feed my love of all things avocado and cheese. As far as drinks, if you are a tequila fan, you can't go wrong with the 100% agave margarita. I like my margarita to actually taste of tequila and not just sweet and sour, and this margarita fits the bill. We liked it enough on our first visit to bring the in-laws back on their next visit to town- a high vote of approval!"}
{"text":"This is a food fight restaurant and they always do a great job.  Staff is friendly.  Great margaritas and we also really like the mango habanero salsa...spicy but awesome."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch: The Chicken Fried Chicken is ah-maze-ing! If you're hungry (possibly hung over) and looking for some comfort food, this is the menu item to try. The biscuit is perfectly done (i.e., not dry at all), the gravy is awesome, the chicken is moist with a perfectly light-and-crispy outside and the egg is an added bonus in the mix. It comes with hash browns which are also wonderful! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"El Dorado brunch is AMAZING. Please eat their mango-pineapple french toast. It is amazing.   Margaritas at night are pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Not a wow experience.   Food portions were huge. I had the bbq pork sliders which were ok.  Also had the vegan chili which was very good.  Tacos were ok.  It wasn't bad food just mediocre and I probably wouldn't choose to back.    Service was ok.   Server was nice. But she seemed very busy.  I wouldn't say best service but not bad either."}
{"text":"After waiting 30 minutes past the reservation time for our group, and then being treated with outright hostility by the manager, we won't be returning to El Dorado   despite liking lots of other restaurants owned by this large group in Madison.   We went to El Dorado Grill on Sept. 12 with reservations for a party of eight & arrived  on time.  After waiting 15 minutes past the reservation time, we checked in with the  hostess.  We did the same at 25 minutes since they were now serving groups of  four that didn't have reservations, and suggested that they consider pulling to  tables of four together.   At 30 minutes, we asked to see the manager.  This guy (about 6'3\" and going about 240) ground my hand hard as he introduced himself.  I said that we had been waiting now for 30 minutes past our reservation time.  He said he wouldn't kick out other patrons (group at a table of 8 that were lingering talking after paying the bill).  When I suggested he could pull two tables of four together, the manager said,  \"I've been in this business for 20 years.   Are you telling me what to do?\"  I told him that  we were just trying to have a nice evening with our guests and wished that he'd work with us.  He said,  \"if you want to ruin your evening that's your problem!\" and glared at me.  (By the way, I am a grey haired guy in his 60's and was accompanied by my wife was pretty shocked by this guy's behavior.)     Five minutes later they pulled two tables of four together and seated us.  The manager never even apologized for the delay.    This place used to be good when Tex Tubbs ran it.  It is running on its past reputation."}
{"text":"Went for brunch this morning with a group.  They take reservations and sat us on time.  The wait staff in general looked tired and possibly hungover, but if I was 10 years younger and without children, I probably would be too on a Sunday morning.  At any rate, they got the job done.  They offered a nice array of breakfast drinks. The Bloody Marys were adequately garnished.  I opted for the blueberry bacon pancakes.  Normally I am a bit of bacon purist and prefer my bacon on the side, but I was pleasantly surprised by the combination.  Many of the other brunch entrees looked quite appetizing, and if I go back, I would likely order one of the more Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"Over 50 types of Tequila? I had no idea! There are actually tequila's that are triple the price of a bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne. Their selection of wine was also quite good. Alcohol aside, the pork chops were perfect. 2-3 inches thick and succulent. I wasn't all that impressed with the cheese enchilada, but that is more my fault for deciding to try something that I normally don't eat. So, the pork chop gets a five star!"}
{"text":"Eldorado has the best Margaritas in the city. It's most likely from the best selection of Tequila around. Creative menu with amazing appetizers."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best breakfast (well, brunch) in Mad-town.  Yippee Hash is a personal fave, but one really can't go wrong with any of the dishes (I've tried about 8 and been happy every time.)  Be sure to get a side of their house-made chipotle puree - it's divine.  Be prepared for a relaxed dining environment, as you will not be rushed.  On the flip-side, you'll also wait a bit longer for your food.  The old-time country background music just adds to the western ambience.  So, kick back, enjoy the experience and bring a paper (or order a bloody) if you are the ancy-type."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Eldorado Grill a great review but our experience was not great.  My parents were in town and the asked if we could go to a nice breakfast.  Had not been to Eldorado Grill but read some good reviews on the web and their Southwest breakfast menu was appealing.  Arrived Sunday at noon and there was a 45 minutes wait, fine, expected.  After being seated in the outside area a waiter arrived and attempted to take our drink order.  He was not sure if they could make the drink we wanted, asked the bartender, came back with confusing info, had to clarify again, our drinks arrived almost 20 minutes later, girl who delivered drink said they were a different drink then we ordered, brought them back to the bar, the waiter showed up 5 minutes later with the same drink and said they were the ones we ordered.  It took him 20 minutes to return to take our food order.  Our food took almost another hour!!! When it arrived my dads pancakes were to tough he could not cut them with a fork.  My moms poached huevos rancheros were cooked well and not very tasty. My pork burrito was good. The hostess did come over sometime after we were done and said they were taking the pancakes and 2 drinks of our bill.   Our waiter continued to offer slow services even as the restaurant was now empty, I had to run our charge card to the bar due to the waiter no returning to retrieve it after 15 minutes. We did not see him again.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The only place I know where I can get a seat for a weekend brunch without waiting. Normally, that would be a bad thing, but I think people just haven't discovered this place in the morning yet. Lots of windows and a Southern exposure make this place a bright way to start your morning.  They've got eggs and pancakes with a slight Southwestern twist. The brunch is much more reasonably priced than the dinners. And the staff are actually friendly first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"Top-notch place already, but wife and I did Sunday brunch that was as good as we have ever had. French toast with pineapple-mango topping and huevos rancheros with a verde sauce. INCREDIBLE.   Well worth the trip into town"}
{"text":"El Dorado Grill is located inside an old candy factory next door to Ground Zero coffee shop.  They specialize in Tex-Mex food and have a huge menu.  The restaurant has a nice warm atmosphere with all kinds of tequila bottles lined on single shelves near the ceiling.  They also play old time country music which really compliments the atmosphere.    Chips and Salsa are quite good.  The Margaritas here are delicious!    The handmade Tamales are filled with shredded seasoned pork and are very moist and tasty.    The enchiladas with Oaxacan Mole Sauce is really good however, I'm not a fan of the sour cream they drizzle on top (I love sour cream and I know other places that drizzle SC on top of their mole sauce, but I really think it interferes with the sauce so I usually ask for no sour cream).   The Chicken Chalupa is good.  It's like a tostada with grilled seasoned chicken (wish it was a little more seasoned and spicy), mixed greens and pico de gallo and a dollop of SC).   Recently had the Machaca Pork Chalupa which is I think is more flavorful than the chicken.  Recently had the K.W.'s Texas Smoked Brisket - delicious!  The brisket is coated with 8 secret spices and slow roasted for 12 hrs.  Can't go wrong with that!  It's served on Texas toast which gets pretty soggy/mushy - it should just be served on the side or not at all since there are yummy little corn cakes served with this dish as well.  They really pile on the mashed potatoes (a bit much if you ask me) and the blackeyed peas are ok.  I really need to try more of their desserts.  I've only had the Chocolate Ancho Pecan Pie.  It was pretty good however the top of the pie was a little on the burnt side."}
{"text":"I went with a group of four. We had reservations and our booth was ready when we arrived.  We had Tamales and Seafood Cakes as an appetizer. The seafood cakes were amazing! I had the pork burrito as an entree and I loved it.   The others ordered chicken fajitas, fish tacos and tenderloin and all enjoyed it as well. A couple people tried my burrito and said they would try that next time too.   Our server was great too. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"El Dorado Grill is a great Tex-Mex restaurant in Madison... The atmosphere is wonderful and the overall dining experience is great but the service was rather slow but still friendly... The food was really good. The fish cakes was outstanding with a great punch of flavor, the BBQ Tex-Mex sliders had a great smokey flavor to it witch I really loved also the fajitas are really good with a great touch of spice. Overall I really liked El dorado grill and I hope to return soon!!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed...Service was below average...had to ask for plates and just the basics...meal was average..."}
{"text":"Exceptional breakfast with great service. Attended to my allergy needs in high regards. Super impressed"}
{"text":"Great margaritas, happy hour and service. I like the food, though it's expensive."}
{"text":"Recently discovered Eldorado Grill, after 25 years of buzzing all over Madison.  Been there three times in the past 6 weeks, all excellent experiences.  This place is a combination of Southern and Southwestern, with some Central Mexico influences. Rather eclectic execution of all three cuisines.    Read the menu carefully, and ask your server questions.  If you are lucky enough to be served by Walker, game on!  The guy taught me more about tequila in 10 minutes than I've learned in my 40 plus years of cocktailing.  Ignore the negative reviews, try the place and make up your own mind.     Excellent Saturday/Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"appetizers super delicious  Main course not so good Big selection of Alcohol but relatively expensive  Good service, overall experience just OK."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch, 5 people, 11AM.  Restaurant was busy, but there was no wait for a table.  Let's start with the food/drinks: Bloody Mary was too garlicky, I only drank half.  Everyone seemed pleased with their food; huevos rancheros were well salted/spiced.  If this review only considered the quality of food, it'd be 4 stars.  Onto the service...our waiter was an EMBARRASSMENT.  * Our waiter neglected to fill our water and coffee throughout our visit.  It got so bad that my boyfriend grabbed the coffee and water carafe from the bussers' area and refilled our drinks on more than one occasion.  Somehow none of the other waitstaff noticed us either.  * Tables that placed their orders after us received their food before us.  Our meal took an hour in getting to the table.  * Our waiter never asked how the meal tasted or if he could get us anything.  It took us asking repeated times to actually get more gravy/syrup.  * Our waiter only visited our table 3 times and spoke no more than 10 total words to us.  Working in food service requires communication with your customer; this guy must have missed class that day.  * When the check came, we all had our cash on the table and one person had their credit card out.  The waiter walked up to our table, grabbed the credit card, without saying anything, and ran it.  I was excited to add Eldorado Grill to our growing list of good brunch spots to enjoy with out of town guests, but after this experience I will recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Coming from a Texan....this was the best \"Mexican/ Tex-mex\" brunch if found in madison"}
{"text":"We love this place. Pretty sure we are recognized as regulars for the Happy Hour for margaritas and app specials. They open at 4:30 and quite often we are waiting at the door. Great margaritas and nice tequila selection for neat pours. Texas Torpedoes are great and if you haven't tried their brunch you are missing out stop in and make sure someone in your group orders the awesome Eldorado french toast and someone else gets the Machaca Pork Burrito you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We tried Eldorado for the first time this weekend- it was fairly busy on a Friday night, but not so much that it felt crowded.  Wait staff were super- the mojitos were good, and the salsa was yummy.  I had the pork tenderloin, potatoes, gravy, and beans.  The tenderloin was a little pink for me (sorry, but I grew up afraid of trichinosis), although it was tasty.  The gravy was interesting and the potatoes were good.  The beans, not so much, but whatever.  We did have the chocolate bread pudding, and while I'm a huge fan of traditional bread pudding (Famous Dave's rocks, by the way), this was quite good.    I'm not sure I'd hurry back, but it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Their margaritas are strong and from scratch.  I would totally recomend the Lobster, Shrimp and Seafood Enchilada - YUMM-O!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!   Very accomodating to large groups!   Food was also delicious but it was the bloody mary's that was the bomb! Not only did it tasted f-ing delicious, I had to have the recipe!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! I have been to Madison at least once a year for business and I found this place last time I was in town. I am in town again now and went back for seconds. Fabulous margaritas! Excellent service. They are super generous with booze which is a plus. Coming from Chicago, people are often stingy with the alcohol but expensive with the price. You can enjoy Happy Hour here until 6:30p. Everything I've had to eat and drink has been wonderful. The blackend fish tacos are so tasty! Warning about the spicy margarita, if you order it on a Monday, you may be getting last weeks chili infused tequila which equals pretty spicy. I like spicy but that drink was a bit much for me. I'm not holding it against them though. You always take a risk when you try something new. Trust me, this is a must visit for dinner if your are in town or a regular. I will miss it when I go back home and hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Mexican food AND barbecue!? AWESOME! It's the most expensive Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, but they serve more upscale versions of the traditional dishes. I've been happy with everything I've ordered here, and the margaritas are great."}
{"text":"Revised 1/4/15: We went for brunch and the place was buzzing! Tip: call ahead if you're on the way and they will put your name down for a table. Wait time was under 30 minutes, not bad for such a busy spot! The blue corn pancakes were really tasty and the syrup was a perfect combo with a unique spicy flavor! I loved the light fixture made of a fire pit ring, so neat!   Oriignal Post: It may have been just where we were seated, but we were on a porch that was freezing and it did not make the dining experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"THE BEST Margaritas in Madison! Texas torpedoes are my fav!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison (and that is saying something with fine array of restaurants around!)"}
{"text":"Since moving away from Madison, Eldorado is one of those restaurants I miss. The atmosphere is nice...tex mex meets modern design. Very hip.   In regards to the food, dinner entrees don't really stick out. What I do continue to crave, however, is the brunch menu. I LOVE the blue corn pancakes. Highly recommended. I also recommend you wash them down with a mimosa.  My early-morning-empty-tummy misses you, Eldorado."}
{"text":"You must get the blazing saddle and grilled spinach enchiladas! El Dorado has a great spin on Tex Mex with great food and tequila drinks. The service is always timely, and we have always enjoyed our meal. I highly recommend you give them a taste! It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I really, really like Eldorado. I love the physical space and the warm, cozy ambiance. I have been here several times, most often for brunch. The brunch menu has a Southwest feel but you can still get all your classic favorites. The smoked salmon Benedict is my favorite. On one occasion my poached eggs came out with hard yolks. I'm someone who doesn't like to complain but I was disappointed enough to mention it to our server. He was back with 2 freshly poached eggs for me minutes later. On my most recent visit I had the Eldorado eggs. I love that they are served on blue corn cakes but I still thought the dish lacked some kind of wow factor. The dinner menu is also diverse and does have some tasty selections. But for me the thing Eldorado does best is their classic margarita. They use fresh lime and no neon green syrup. It's not too sweet and is one of the freshest tasting margaritas you can find in Madison. Which also leads to the next point, which is that this is a great happy hour spot. Cozy up at the bar with a marg, chips and salsa and you'll be a happy camper!   Service is hit or miss, which is the main reason I'm giving 4 stars. The last time I was here we hardly saw our server and she seemed very disinterested and disconnected. She never refilled our coffee (we had to ask for more when she dropped off our check very prematurely) and we sat with our empty plates in front of us for a full 15 minutes. The host walked by and saw our plates and scooped them up, which was very kind of him!   Assuming your server is having a good day and you start with a margarita, you'll be happy with Eldorado!"}
{"text":"Two different reviews for breakfast then dinner.  Brunch: 4/5 For the life of me, I canNOT get past the first listing on the menu. I think they are just good enough to not look elsewhere. The Eldorado eggs - two poached eggs on top of a blue corn cake with tomatoes, grilled scallions, and smoked bacon, with scallion-lime cream sauce (on the side for me). Served with greens and house potatoes. All of it combined just works. The most interesting thing is the blue corn pancake. They are small, with a slight hint of sweetness. Texture is still pancake-y, not gritty like cornmeal. I like 'em. Also, they know how to poach. The hit-or-miss is the consistency of how warm/hot/cool the dish comes to the table. 4/5  Bloody Mary - very good. Tied for second favorite in town. It's house made, decent garnishes, good flavor. 5/5  My brunch buddies LOVE the Hit The Trail Flapjacks - they are the yummy, healthy pancake. BIG pancake with nuts and berries all over it. It really does look great (I had a bite, tastes good too!) I love that they have a pancake that's not whip cream crap all over it. But I need my savory eggs in the morning, and these flapjacks are just too much food to add as a \"side.\" 4/5  Dinner: 3/5 They call themselves a \"smokehouse\" and I'm checking out local \"BBQ\" places. So I thought I'd try the BBQ.  Chicken \"Enchiladas\" - this one really bugged me. It's a FLAUTA (or Taquito, depending on where you're from). Not an enchilada! Google it. Not many places in Madison do this, so I understand why people are raving about them, but shesh, these are just average for any Southerner, and I mean as a flauta/taquito. 2/5  Baja Fish Taco - Mahi mahi fish, blackened. It was average-good. Sub limes for cheese and aioli. Slaw coulda had a little more pizzaz, but overall, this was the best dish of the night. 3/5  Pork ribs - not real BBQ, maybe oven \"BBQ?\" The meat was not dry, but mildly moist; not tender, but not brittle, fatty short rib, and no \"smoke.\" The sauce was ok (tangy). 2/5  Side note: I saw the chicken friend chicken - this is not traditional (pounded with softer breading) CFC for a Southerner. This version is a chicken breast deep fried, but it was a very BIG portion. It beat up the woman who ordered it.   Overall, I really like the brunch and bloody. The dinner was ok, but I'd probably go again with friends.  (On BBQ list, place is 9th.)"}
{"text":"Eldorado has the best margaritas I've had in Madison. Tex Tubb's is a close second, but Eldorado is the best. Check out their happy hour, the drinks are cheaper! You can even get discounts on neat pours of their amazing tequila selection.  I've been here quite a few times and never been disappointed. The drinks are great, the staff is wonderful, and the food is fantastic.  The brunch deserves its own paragraph. It's my favorite brunch in town. Good drinks and wonderful tex-mex food. I'm reading a 3-star review on the sidebar as I write this and I can't believe it. Someone complaining about no free chips and salsa (they're really cheap), the queso (which we've ordered twice and the waitstaff always explained was not normal queso) and the lack of frozen margaritas... seriously? If you want cheap, by-the-numbers big-box type mexican, go to Pedro's. This restaurant is for people that enjoy good food and drinks.  Sorry, back to the brunch. I've had half a dozen items off the brunch menu and loved every one. If you come here on Sunday morning, you might want to make a reservation because everyone knows what a great brunch they have and they all come on Sunday.   It's a bit more expensive than your average Mexican or Tex-Mex place, but the quality of the food, drinks, and service is well worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch!!  The blueberry bacon pancakes and the hit the trail pancakes are the best pancakes in the state- and you can't find a better margarita anywhere."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on Sunday morning. We made a reservation for 10:00 AM. Upon entering, the restaurant was about 3/4 full. By the time we left an hour later, the restaurant was packed.  We started our meal with the Texas Torpedoes. They were highly recommended, and I am glad we order them. They may have been the highlight of our brunch. The bacon was cooked perfectly, and the shrimp inside the pepper surrounded by cheese provided an added a punch of flavor.   I ordered the El Dorado Eggs. I am a huge fan of biscuits, so I subbed a biscuit for the corn cakes. The waitress had no problem with the substitution. I also ordered the cream on the side. I loved about the breakfast came with a side of greens. They were nicely dressed and added a lightened flare to the meal.   The only reservation my entire table had with our meals were the house potatoes. We couldn't really figure out if they were good or not. They are not really fried crispy and are a little mushy. A different potato for sure. I'd rather have some nice red potatoes or more of a fried hash brown.   This place definitely deserves its four stars though. A true Madison gem!"}
{"text":"The only thing I've ever had here is the spinach enchiladas at brunch.  They are so good, I'm afraid to try anything else, in fear that it won't measure up.  The cheese and spinach inside is soooo good and creamy, and the tortillas are just crispy enough.  The salsa on top is the freshest I've ever tasted.  The potatoes are good (when aren't potatoes at least good?), but I'm not a huge fan of beans (anywhere).  I'd like to sub the beans out for an egg, but the $2 substitution charge is something I refuse to pay.  Have fun trying the various Bloody Marys!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Eldorado Grill, and I really enjoyed the Southwestern ambiance: large leather booths, cacti, horseshoe decorations. Our server was prompt and friendly, and our steak fajitas were excellent! The sautéed vegetable medley really added to the steak flavor. However, we were slightly disappointed to see that chips and salsa were not complementary."}
{"text":"The brunch here is extensive and delicious. Although their standard brunch menu has plenty to make your decision difficult, I decided to go with their special - a chorizo, cheese, and onion omelet with salsa verde on top and crispy potato quarters on the side. This might have been one of the best omelets I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. A great unique change of pace compared to all the standard omelets out there.  They also make some mean bloody marys. I had the Bloody Maria, which comes with tequila instead of vodka. Although I wouldn't get it every time, it was very interesting and ultimately delicious with my meal. It also comes with a beer chaser shot.  Cool building, nice hardwood interior, and friendly service. I see a return trip in my future the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Definitely take advantage of the free chips and salsa for checking in!  We were able to sit outdoors in the heated tent area.  The restaurants indoor decor was nice, but there's something really nice about being able to eat outdoors in WI November! I had the honey-ginger margarita and would definitely have it again.  There's a nice tequila kick to the margarita that the ginger adds to.   For an entree, I had the fish tacos with fried mahi mahi.  It was good, but between the corn tortillas and fried fish, it felt a bit dry.  The slaw and aoli added some juice and flavor, but I could have used more.  I think if I had went with blackened fish instead, it'd have been better. I've heard brunch is phenomenal here so we'll likely be back!"}
{"text":"I go here a lot and it is consistently delicious. More interesting than plain old Mexican or tex-mex. Nice big chips and salsa to start, and yummy house margaritas (both marked down for all night happy hour Mondays), and then it's hard to go wrong with the entrees."}
{"text":"Alright, I had to update my review after trying out Eldorado again. This time around, the experience was miles better. My sister and I went around 6 p.m. on a Tuesday, without a reservation, and were seated right away despite the seemingly busy restaurant. We used the free chips and salsa Yelp deal (well worth it) and enjoyed those and split a margarita before our main courses. The margarita was strong, but delicious!   I ordered the Smoked Pulled Pork (can't really ever go wrong with pulled pork) and it was so good. It was cooked perfectly and the chipotle potato salad that comes as one of the sides was AMAZING -- I might need to figure out how to make it at home.   My sister ordered the Fajitas, which is served with generous portions of chicken/peppers/guac/rice/beans and tortillas. They're set up where you have the ingredients in front of you on separate plates and then make the fajitas yourself, which is nice if you want to control your portions (and makes boxing up leftovers easier). She said they were tasty - no complaints there.   Service overall was friendly and attentive. The waiter seemed to consistently be on the lookout to fill our water glasses, which is always nice. Thanks, Eldorado, for giving us a great second experience!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for Father's Day and they were busy. We were seated in the bar area, which is not nearly as inviting as the main room, so that was a disappointment. My Killer Bloody Maria was spicy hot and well garnished, but overall rather taste-free. I can do better at home. Brunch plates were good, but honestly not great. Temperatures a little off as if some components had been sitting around. We've been coming here since they opened, maybe 20 years ago, and I really want to love it, but I don't so much. Just okay."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: trendy Tex-Mex restaurant.  El Dorado Grill was a busy place for Sunday brunch, but we found a spot on their outside, porch-thing-room. It's a nice space, and service was attentive. Checking in on Yelp got us a free chips and salsa (I personally am wary of Mexican places that don't offer these for free to begin with).   I ordered the Breakfast Burrito ($9.19), which was full of scrambled eggs, chorizo, pico de gallo, black beans, and jack cheese. To be honest, there was an overpowering amount of beans and a lack of chorizo. The side of house potatoes were greasy-good, but the refried pinto beans were inedible. I couldn't place their taste, but it was not appealing. I will say the half of a burrito I had leftover for lunch the next day reheated quite well. Would I return? Probably not. It was okay."}
{"text":"Yah I really like this place! I would go early cause it can be hard to get in the restaurant. With a great selection of Margaritas and Bloody Marys and the Texas two- step . Parking nearby."}
{"text":"The vegetable goat cheese empanadas are easily the best thing I have eaten since I moved to Madison. The restaurant itself is very loud in peak times. People need to use their inside voices, but thats not the restaurants fault"}
{"text":"We went here as a large group and had reservations. The wait was exceptionally long and at least half an hour longer than what we were told when we had arrived. Food was okay but everyone got served at different times and due to what could only have been lack of communication between staff, certain people at the bar were not cut off when they clearly should have been. I would not bring my family here if I knew the extent to which the patrons are permitted to inebriate themselves. Perhaps earlier in the day it is nicer. The salad I got was great but the portion was quite large and I felt bad wasting much of the chevre that came with it but there was just so much and it was not the type of dish to pack up well. Others in my party were not fans of the corn flapjacks with their meals although the rest of their food was good. The decor was nice. We parked down by the water and enjoyed the walk to the restaurant. Many beautiful homes and cute shops. The walk back from the restaurant was not as nice (re: drunk people) but thankfully the streets were well lit enough to avoid issues."}
{"text":"Solid food and service.  Couldn't find any fault  with our experience.  The highlight of the meal for me was the pickled onions they put on all plates."}
{"text":"Love the building and how they have it set up and the people that work there are very nice. But the food is very average at best and lacks the taste that wants to bring you back. Been there several times and wanting to love it, but just can't."}
{"text":"Delicious as always! I recommend their breakfast, lunch or dinner to anyone!! Today, came here for brunch and strayed away from my favorite mango mimosa and got raspberry instead...amazing! Yippie Vegetable Hash was fantastic and not too heavy. Prices for most brunch dishes are under $10! Super affordable for Madison breakfast. Wait was about 45 minutes, so we enjoyed the bar. Great meal."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place and the service is always great. I have heard such great things about their brunch but I have not yet gone for brunch yet. I can speak for the dinner though. Their margaritas were really goood and cheaap (it was some sort of special). They have a huge menu. The enchiladas and meats were good."}
{"text":"Last night we had a fabulous dinner at Eldorado Grill!  We went out with another couple who knew the menu really well.  We started with Texas Torpedo's...I'm not a spicy fan so I didn't have one but the other three at the table loved them!  I'm trying to make healthier choices so I went with the Thai Vegetable Fajitas.  They were fantastic!  Definitely plenty of food - great atmosphere and service.  I had three drinks while we were there (I'm making healthier food choice, not stopping drinking).  The first was the Iguana Margarita.  The melon flavored at a fun unique twist I'd never tasted in a margarita - definitely good, definitely strong.  Next I tried the Sangria.  It went really well with my dinner.  In the meantime my husband had ordered the 'Danger's Door County Cocktail' and I took a sip to try it.  Normally I would have stopped at two drinks...I immediately realized I had to had a Door County Cocktail of my own.  I'm not even sure how to describe it.  A tart, fruity drink that you know had a lot of booze but couldn't really taste that it was there...wonderful.    The food was great, the company fantastic, service wonderful, and I would go back for all those things but I honestly will definitely have to go back just to have another Danger's Door County Cocktail."}
{"text":"I'm so grateful that Ashley recommended us to visit Eldorado Grill for restaurant week! We managed to get seats within 20 minutes of calling. They set us down promptly and we quickly got settled with drinks and snacks to start!   I love our starter - this gigantic bowl of guacamole and chips. The chips came out hot, so either they made their chips (hurray!) or they heated it up at least. The guacamole tasted delicious and we could stop getting more. Took 2 baskets of chips to finish the guacamole among 4 people (Thanks Ashley!).  There was a myriad of drinks and if you're a fan of Tequila, you're in for a treat here! Onotse got Mojitos (2 actually, since it was that good), Ashley got a honey ginger alcoholic mix and Matt got a smokey tequila cocktail. Everyone enjoyed their drinks!   So, restaurant week - for serving so many people of the same dish, I'm impressed. The Green Chile Pork stew was PERFECTLY done. soft pork that tears apart with the fork, the green chile was aptly spiced, not too hot but keeps you warm. LOVE IT. Onotse got a GIGANTIC salad for only $1.29. and it comes with lots of spinach, walnuts and some other things. Ashley got the jalapeno poppers, which looked just like bacon wrapped dates but instead of dates, there's jalapeno. She said she would get it again, but you should share it with some other person.  Main dish, most of us got the smoked brisket. It was alright for me, not over the top, but the dish was a hearty meal. Lots of beans, lots of salad (no dressing), nice potato salad, lovely corn pancake (in place of corn bread). And the brisket was served on a piece of bread. Lots of meat to keep you full. But I was expecting more like braised beef, instead of spam-like texture? Definitely not something I would pick up again..  Finally, for dessert, I got the pecan chile pie. I didn't like the crust since I'm a cookie/graham cracker crust fan.. Also, there was no obvious chile spice in the pie.. tasted more like pecan chocolate pie. It was alright. Matt got the mole root beer (mole ice cream), but sadly it had peanuts so the rest of us got to try it. It was REALLY spicy. Don't think anyone can finish that lump of spicy ice cream. spicy and cold at the same time, what an experience!!  There's covered outdoor seating in the summer as well!"}
{"text":"I've been to Eldorado several times in my occasional travels to Madison. I've always enjoyed the food, drink, and service.  I have to say tonight's meal was the best I've ever had there--green chili meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens.  I don't like barbecue sauce, so I asked to have that on the side, and pretty much ignored it, but the meatloaf lacked for nothing in taste or moisture.  The mashed potatoes were garlicky and delicious, and the collard greens were not the wilted green mess I'm accustomed to (from my dear Southern mama), but lightly cooked, with a smoky flavor to them.  Every meal I've had at Eldorado has been delicious, but this one takes the cake.  (No, I had no room for cake or any other dessert, and in fact took away half of my meal as leftovers--which I very much look forward to consuming!)"}
{"text":"The food is ok, typically not what I would go out of my way for if I were seeking Tex-Mex. But their Blazing Saddle Margarita is fantastic!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH is the way to begin an ongoing relationship with El Do.  Breakfast entrees are priced low for such big plates of food.  Indulge in a bloody or a rita to start your day off right.  Dinner is heavy duty and full of flavor.  Nightly specials and a righteous menu keep this place swinging.  The waitstaff is chill and gets the job done swiftly.  Finish your meal off with the superb creme brulee.  And again, best place for margarita, large selection of tequila and an overall fine bar selection."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Eldorado Grill for New Years Eve 17'. The staff, while busy, was still attentive and expedient. Overall, the food was as to be expected from a TexMex restaurant in the Northern Midwest - but the margaritas made up for the food. Eldorado is certainly a welcome respite from the typical cheese and beer restaurants you would find in Madison.   I'd offer a strong recommendation for Eldorado for anyone looking for a good meal with decent drinks."}
{"text":"El Dorado is my absolute favorite place for brunch in Madison. For one: they take reservations. Hard to come by in this city! I get the chilaquiles every time (used to alternate with their quiche, but they removed it from the menu.) Their bloody marys are far and away better than anywhere else in the city. I also recommend getting a single slice of french toast on the side. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Another mediocre Food Fight, Inc. disappointment. Service is friendly, atmosphere is nice, but the food is unsatisfying."}
{"text":"Excellent Monday happy hour all evening - the apps are half off so you can make a dinner out of them. The chips & salsa are addicting, but try not to fill up on just those! The margaritas are excellent as well; I've tried all the fruit ones (and they're great) but my favorites are the honey ginger one (and I don't even like ginger usually) and the blazing saddle. Brunch is pretty good too, but given the happy hour deal, I usually try to just go on Monday. In the summer they have a nice covered porch area too."}
{"text":"I've only been for dinner, just so ya know. But I've been for dinner like a hundred times. One of my favorite restaurants in Madison!   Delicious food. Fantastic margaritas (try the world famous version) and chips and salsa. Great atmosphere, very cool space.  Try the pork burrito, pork chalupa, southwestern fishcakes, pasilla chicken enchiladas with mole and the blackened catfish.  Yum."}
{"text":"I was so confused why this place got less than 5 stars until I tried their dinner once. But forget about that - I'm going to write about all the reasons I'm in love with their ridiculously FANTASTIC brunch!  1. They take reservations, which is rare for brunch spots in Madison. This makes it a great place to go with friends, family, visitors, etc. (or when you're anticipating a rough Saturday morning in your future).  2. It has great decorations. Yes, the bathrooms leave something to be desired (they're shared with the coffee shop next store), but the restaurant itself has a southwestern vibe that makes you feel comfortable.  3. The waitresses are very friendly and willing to help make suggestions for your order.  4. You can order chips & salsa...for breakfast.  5. The aforementioned chips & salsa are unlimited and they are simply amazing.  6. They have a great selection of mimosas and bloody marys, and are not sparing with the alcohol. Since I'm not a bloody mary person, I highly recommend the blackberry mimosa. Also, if you're feelin wild, try their margarita (formerly known as the Brunch margarita).  7. Their pineapple mango french toast is out of this world. I got it the first time I came (from my waitress's recommendation) and I haven't gotten anything else since.   8. Speaking on my boyfriends behalf, the chicken friend chicken biscuit is his go-to and he gets it every single time. This dish is mammoth and has all the mouthwatering flavors that make for a perfect brunch dish. It comes with potatoes, which I try to snag since they're super delicious.  Needless to say, you need to give this place a try for brunch. Or better yet, don't, and there will be more room for me!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Eldorado Grill once and I have to say it was good.    We started with the street tacos and empanadas.  The flavors were quite full, but balanced.  The cheese in the empanadas was very rich, but the exterior was a lot lighter to balance it out.  The tacos were a bit laking in flavor, but ok for a lite bland flower.  I had the enchiladas.  My wife had the salmon.  I would highly recommend the salmon.  It was ample, perfectly done.  The glaze had the perfect amount of sweetness and seasoning.  The enchiladas were more like to small taquitos without any sauce.  The rice and beans that came with the enchiladas were ok, but a bit bland as well.    The pecan pie was pretty awesome.  It has chocolate chips on the bottom and on the crust.  I would prefer more praline instead of chocolate chips, but it was still pretty good.     I didn't have anything off the regular menu we only had the Restaurant Week Menu.  There regular menu may be quite different."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We arrived and were told there was a 30 minute wait, or we could sit and eat at the bar. We were happy to sit at the bar, which was not crowded. The bartender did acknowledge us, but never asked us if we wanted a drink or a food menu. He waited on a few people, never again looking our way. About 10 minutes go by and he walked over to a few girls at the bar and started flirting with them. We got up and left. Bartender never noticed. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Slow service, confused host; but great vibe for brunch w/ mimosas!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for several years and was really looking fwd to it .Made reservations and went for dinner, boy was I disappointed, they changed their menu and its definatley NOT mexican! Thai Burrito? and other NON MEXICAN entrees , I won't be back very limited menu choices  We'll have to find another place when we want  REAL mexican."}
{"text":"Just a quick update...  Came here right after work and was extremely hungry. Got a table right away, it was pretty busy  though. Ended up checking in on Yelp and got a free order of chips and salsa, and ended up getting a 2nd refill on both, which was nice since our wait for our food was a good forty five minutes. I ended up getting the Southwestern Fishcakes off the appetizer section on the menu, which was hard for me to choose it was a toss up between three different items. I was happy with what I got though!  Our waitress was fantastic as well! :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this place one time and we were not impressed. I had been having a conversion with a manager on a work project about the lack of quality mexican in Madison and he pointed me to this place. Unfortunately, this manager was not very good, so I probably should have stuck with my gut and crossed this off the list of places to try.   How did I feel when I left the restaurant? The portions were fairly small for the price and the food was not that great. Smaller portions are actually something I tend to prefer these days, so you don't have to have a lot of food, but this is also texmex. Mexican portions should be large since it's fairly cheap to make and is definitely a type of food you can box up and enjoy as a leftover.   So, the hunt for great mexican in Madison continues. I've heard of a couple solid places of late. Stay tuned for upcoming reviews."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Eldorado Grill. The flavors: sensational. The atmosphere: inviting. The portions: meh. The price: upscale. The service: mixed.  The two of us originally tried to visit Eldorado Grill on Saturday night. The hostess seemed very confused. Several patrons were standing near the hostess area complaining about the slow service. The hostess finally told us it would be a two hour wait and we decided to try another time. No big deal and the fact that they were busy is a good sign, but the hostess definitely didn't seem to have it together.  Since we were in the area, we tried again on Sunday and were able to be seated immediately. The hostess told us we could either sit in the bar area for the Happy Hour menu or the dining room for the regular menu. We elected for the dining area. The room is beautiful with exposed wood beams, a high shelf w/liquor bottles, a beaten copper mantle on the fireplace, a mural above the fireplace and glassed in cabinets filled with Western pulp books and various southwestern paraphernalia.  Our waitress was friendly enough and brought over the menus. The tequila and mescal menu is impressive -- many varieties I had never heard of and they have various flight options available.  Where I'm from, inexpensive southwestern restaurants are ubiquitous. So as I was perusing the dinner menu I was somewhat apprehensive. The prices were about $5 higher than I would expect, and they charge for the chips and salsa. Nevertheless, we ordered the chips and salsa. I also ordered the Pasilla Chile Chicken Enchilada and my partner had the Grilled Lobster, Shrimp, and Crab Enchiladas. Our waitress brought a huge basket of chips as well as a small dish of salsa. The salsa was incredible - fresh, bright, and the charred pepper flavor was intense. We really enjoyed it. I was mildly concerned as we still had a large basket of chips, but no salsa left. Our waitress came back by and asked if we'd like more salsa and then refilled it from a pitcher. I can't really describe just how good the salsa was!  When my chicken enchiladas came, I was again mildly concerned. Three small tightly rolled enchiladas with just a hint of salsa verde, a scoop of rice and a small side of beans. It's a reasonable portion of food, but certainly not what we're used to in the midwest and for a hefty price. Once I started eating though, I was very pleased. The chicken enchiladas and salsa verde were so flavorful. The rice was dense with almost a corn bread consistency. I tried some of my partner's seafood enchiladas and again the flavors were spot on.  By the end of the meal, I was very impressed with the quality of the food. The portions could have been a little bigger, the prices a little lower, but the quality was so good, it was worth it. I'm probably not going to head back there if I'm feeling famished, but if I'm in the mood for some quality southwestern food, this is a great option."}
{"text":"Oh man, oh man! Eldorado is absolutely amazing!! Easily one of the best brunches I've had in Madison.  First, let me preface my review by saying that I normally avoid Bloody Marys like the plague. Despite my propensity for alcoholic drinks, it's probably my last possible choice. In fact, I'd probably choose water (ewww) over it.  Anyways, given the massive hype its Bloody Marys have gotten, and by hype, I mean my friends constantly talking about how it's the best thing ever (eye roll)... I decided to give them a chance.  My Bloody Mary arrived with a sampler of beer (starting things off right already), and was pretty delicious. Of course, it's not the best thing ever like my friends claim, but it was pretty damn good.   The fact that I highly enjoyed it should say a lot already. It was perfectly spiced, and had enough alcohol to counterbalance the normally overwhelming mix.   For food, I got their Texas Two Step, which definitely lived up to its name. There's nothing more Texan than two ginormous buttermilk biscuits topped with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, sausage and gravy. I have never had something so delicious, yet so, so terrible for me.  I definitely plan on coming here more often, so who knows, I might even start ordering Bloody Marys elsewhere (yeah right)."}
{"text":"El Dorado is my favorite spot for tex-mex goodies and a good bloody.   Have been here many times and finally get a chance to write a review after coming here for restaurant week.  They have an amazing drinks list, from the classical cocktails to high-end tequila, bloody maries, margaritas and even MEZCAL! The bloody Mary remains my go-to and favorite in town!  They have a wide selection of dishes, from vegetarian options, to catfish, and barbeque foods and other unique tex-mex dishes. You will always have a new experience when you come here. Not just amazing main dishes, but also well done, filling appetizers!  They do a whole day Monday happy hour with a number of cheaper priced small plates and drinks on special!  They are very busy during brunch time and also on the weekend, but luckily they do take reservations! So I recommend you call ahead before you stop by!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to meet up with friends for brunch on a Saturday morning.  This place was packed! We were lucky we got a spot as soon as we did without a reservation.  It's a smaller restaurant with a cozy feel to it.  There's a full bar at one end of the restaurant.    They're known for their southwestern food and there was a lot of those options for breakfast.  I got the Chorizo and Egg Street Tacos. A tortilla with chorizo, scrambled eggs, and some of your favorite taco toppings along with refried beans and potatoes...it was a tremendous meal!  Of course when I got them my eyes said, \"Two tacos? You'll eat this in no time.\"  At the end of the second taco my stomach said, \"Please no more, I'm too full!.\""}
{"text":"$12 for a freaking corn, bean and cheese quesadilla?!  You've got to be kidding me.    How much could that have cost to make?  $1.50?"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today, I love the late morning drink selections as well as the fact that you can get chips, salsa, guacamole at 10am without being judged. The smoked chicken enchiladas are my all time favorite (not breakfasty but cheesy, good salsa verde ,and portion is just right). The margaritas hit the spot and be sure to ask for the house made hot sauce- adds just the right amount of heat to any meal."}
{"text":"During my first brunch visit I ordered the eggs benedict and wasn't a huge fan. I've heard a lot of good things though so I decided to go back and had much better experiences going forward. I usually order the texas two step and I love it. They have great cold brew coffee, bloody mary's and other brunch drinks. After 10:30am they start getting pretty busy so I would recommend making a reservation if you want to go later."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and had the blueberry and bacon flap jacks. They were huge, the size of my whole plate. Very tasty. Those flat jacks and the syrup gave me a sugar rush and I later crashed out for a nap. A nice afternoon in my book."}
{"text":"Visited Eldoarado during Restaurant Week and I was surprisingly pleased. I am not usually a fan of Tex-Mex, but their restaurant week menu was appealing to me so I gave it a try. I started off with some chips and salsa (you can get complimentary chips and salsa if you check in through yelp). The chips come in a pretty large basket, so be careful and leave room for dinner! I tired a cup of their pozole soup and it was fine, but I've had better. For my entree I ordered the salmon which came with a pomegranate BBQ glaze, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts. This entree was AMAZING! I loved everything about this dish. The salmon was perfectly cooked, the mashed potatoes were velvety and smooth, and the brussels had a slight crunch. I was going to to return for this exact dish, but It seems that this entree is not on their regular menu so I am super bummed out about that. For my dessert, I had the Chocolate Ancho Pecan Pie and this was tasty too. I want to return and try their Texas Torpedos. A couple next to me ordered those and they looked delicious. I hope I'm wrong about the Salmon, but I still look forward to stopping by again in the near future."}
{"text":"We stopped at opening time on a Saturday for a few drinks and some Chips and Salsa and Guacamole before dinner at another restaurant, since we'd read rave reviews about Eldorado's margaritas.  We found the staff to be decidedly and unusually unfriendly, compared to most restaurants and bars in the area, although the female Bartender was a serious and excellent Mixologist.  Our two favorite Margaritas were the Honey-Ginger & the Eldorado Margarita, although the Mango and Raspberry Margaritas were also interesting, and much fresher and real, and not cloyingly sweet at all. The Chips were fresh, and the Salsa was much more distinctive than the Guacamole, so if you can handle a Heavy dose of disdain from the staff along with your Cocktails, and Chips, you may enjoy a trip to Eldorado."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Friday after driving past it over the years. It's actually quite tasty. Had the quinoa stuffed poblano and a regular margarita on the rocks. I'm glad there were a few vegan items to choose from, again this is one of those places where you can't take out ingredients because certain things are pre-prepared. Which can leave you with more limited choices on the menu. The guac was so delicious. Everyone in our party loved what they ordered to eat. I thought the poblano was so smokey, it made the table smell like camp fire. I also asked for hot sauce, because I like my food hotter than the sun, it was kind of the the person caring for our table to say they made their own and to be careful because it was really really hot...I honestly thought it could have been hotter.  I would definitely rec this place and go here again."}
{"text":"We stopped in Madison on our way back home to Chicago What a treat the salsa is made fresh everyday and it's Amazon For those who are gluten free the chips are fried in dedicated friers so they are safe to eat and are thin and crispy The blackened catfish was very flavorful Dare you to try to have just one  margarita They were soo good that we had the second one ordered before we finished the first ones Eat at the Eldorado!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, the last time being two weeks ago.  I had the Machaca Pork Burrito.  Tasty as heck.  The service is very friendly and prompt.  Love it.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Margaritas were great, as usual. Service was sub par. Hostess seemed awkward and disinterested. Our server was OK, but a little too terse and didn't smile much. Bartender seemed irritated to be there, didn't say anything when he approached the table with our drinks and didn't smile. He did say thank you when we left."}
{"text":"the ginger margarita is amazing. had the salmon and shrimp with pear jicama salsa which was super delicious. the shrimp were slightly overcooked so a little tough but the flavor was still good. Also loved the asparagus."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with some ladies this past Sunday.   I know for dinner this place is definately overpriced for what you get but for brunch, it ws definately reasonably priced for brunch, with most items around $8.   It was packed when we got there but we only had to wait about 10 minutes.  We went to the bar and got two bloodys and a coffee.  We got the one with the house-made chili infused vodka and it came with an amber beer chaser, for $6.50. When we got seated we waited, no lie, about 10 minutes before we were approached by a server.  I was just about to go to the host stand when a frazzled server stopped by.  We placed our order and waited, again, for about 30 min to get our food.  I work in the service industry and not even dinner items take 30 minutes... Whatever. The food was good though and almost made up for the wait.  I originally wanted the mango-pineapple french toast, but they were out of the mango :( so I had the banana walnut french toast... it was really good, and they coat the bread in some type of crunchy crumbs before they grill them! My friends both got the crab eggs benedict and they loved it!  At the end of the meal, we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the bill paid and get a box.  If it wasn't for the shoddy service I wouldv'e given this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've always thought the food here was good, but I was completely wowed during a recent brunch experience. The hit the trail pancakes are absolutely delicious and you must order one as a side even if you order other entrees. I've never had anything like it. It's a dense pancake, perfectly griddled, and includes seeds and nuts. The butter has a little Southwest kick to it, too!  My husband and I both had wonderful egg dishes and shared a pancake. The service was excellent.  They take reservations, which are highly recommended. We didn't know this, but were seated right away on the heated patio, which is first come, first served. The bar is also open seating.  This is definitely a brunch hot spot for Madison, with unique flavors and a great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with Eldorado Grill but definitely plan on going back to give it another chance because it had potential."}
{"text":"Best brunch I have ever had. Omelets are absolutely fantastic, as are the breakfast burritos and bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"Eldorado is the place to go for happy hour! They have half priced appetizers ($3.50-$4.50) and they all are delicious. I recommend trying the tamales & fish cakes. During happy hour the chips & salsa are $0.90 and they're wonderful. Happy hour margaritas are $6. I really like the \"World Famous Margarita\", it's lime on the rocks...and will knock off your socks. On Mondays they have all day happy hour. I've also been here for brunch, everyone enjoyed what they ordered. They have a great variety on their brunch menu; a nice balance between sweet & savory. There can be a long wait for brunch, if you have a big group you may want to get a reservation. I've also had Eldorado cater a graduation party that I planned, all the guests LOVED the food. People raved about the catered potato salad & pulled pork sandwiches. If you love Mexican food you must try Eldorado Grill."}
{"text":"I've tried this place on a number of occasions and have never left feeling like I want to go back. (however some of my friends do, so back I go) Their tequila selection is amazing, I'd recommend it for drinks. The food has varied for me from not okay to bad. Go for Happy Hour, then go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Great brunch.  Wonderful selection and the food is fresh.  I have tried multiple dishes and am almost always enthralled.  Wonderful Bloody Mary's and their chips/salsa is fabulous.  I always get a side of their house salsa to eat with my food.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  One time we had to wait a very long time for our food and didn't say anything, but our waitress apologize regardless and gave us free drink coupons.  Definitely recommend making reservations for brunch or on a weekend night.  The wait can long otherwise."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, prompt service, delicious food. Love to go for brunch or for dinner in the winter."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and LOVED it! The salmon was perfectly cooked (I'm pretty snobby about that), and the sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts complemented the fish well. That, with the street tacos (definitely try the fried avocado ones!) and dessert were well worth the $25."}
{"text":"I was visiting in Madison this past weekend, and we went to Eldorado for brunch. What a great experience. We started with Bloody Mary's with a small beer chaser. For entrees, we had the Eggs Benedict with salmon, French Toast, and the street tacos. Everything was excellent. We also had a good server. The place was crowded, but the staff didn't seem to have any problems, either out front or in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been to Eldorado Grill four times now - once during Madison's restaurant week, once for Happy Hour, once for brunch, and once (most recently) for dinner. All four times, I've come away thinking that I should have started eating here MUCH sooner (something I kick myself about now that I've moved out of Madison).  Some favorites from the menu:  -EVERY SINGLE MARGARITA I'VE TRIED. Seriously, folks. These margaritas are just killer. The fruit purees make for a really tasty, fresh drink. The honey-ginger margarita is a unique drink that warms you up from the inside out. The standard margaritas are fresh and smooth. It's all just. so. GOOD.  -Texas Torpedoes. While they give you a bigger kick than you'd expect for only using jalapenos, this appetizer is one that shouldn't be missed at any time of day or night.  -BBQ Glazed Salmon. This was a surprisingly awesome dish. It was a bit more traditional than what you'd expect from a funky Tex-Mex place like Eldorado Grill, but I don't even care because I'm still dreaming about that perfect bite of salmon, chutney, garlic mashed potatoes, and brussels sprouts. I can't wait to go back so I can taste it again.  -Eldorado Benedict. I'm a benedict fan, and this one doesn't disappoint. The fact that you get a not-insubstantial piece of salmon along with two potato pancakes and poached eggs... Man oh man, that was the best breakfast I've had in a loooong time. Highly recommend.  Honestly, though, I haven't had anything here that I disliked. The one menu option that didn't meet expectations was the Vegan Chorizo/Vegetable Stuffed Poblano, which, while tasty, didn't have much flavor coming from the chorizo itself. I've had my fair share of non-vegan chorizo and missed its distinctive flavor here. However, the poblano itself had a delicious smoky flavor - one you don't often get from meat-free entrees.  If you're in Madison and wanting a place to check out for dinner, Eldorado Grill does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Ok the first Cadillac margarita was good, the second was SO limey we sent it back!  The food, well the enchiladas were pretty good, fried more like flautas  then enchiladas, but good.  The pork tenderloin was SO over-cooked.  It was take a bite of pork, add a swallow of water, chew and swallow.  It was BAD!  I know this is in a hip hood, but there were definitely very good items and REALLY bad ones.  Mixed bag!  It is nothing like traditional Mexican, it's a take off on Mexican.  I'd recommended the enchiladas, stay far, far a way from pork.  We should have sent it back for the price."}
{"text":"got take out on the blue cornmeal pancakes with chili infused maple syrup. winner in my book! as a pancake nazi-afficiando I am picky with pancakes and these were a nice change from the normal but be loved buttermilk types. the syrup adds a nice kick also."}
{"text":"I visited here on a Monday night for a happy hour get-together with friends.  There's limited seating in the bar area, so if you're going with a large group (10+) you'll have some challenges.  Having said that, they have a great happy hour menu.  Try the Texas Torpedoes (jalapenos stuffed with shrimp and cheese, wrapped in bacon, and grilled) and the Vegetable and Goat Cheese Empanadas with zucchini and mushrooms.  Skip the Southwestern Fish Cakes - while others seemed to like them they were too soggy for me.  The $% Blazing Saddle margarita with their house-made chile tequila is yummy - just make sure to stir it first!  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Brunch here is great! The bloody maria (spicy bloody mary) is stupendous.  The decor/ambiance is nice and all the food I've had is tasty."}
{"text":"You'll love this place if you enjoy delayed gratification and sporting layered winter looks.  Pros: - pretty tasty food - extensive drink menu - honest server  Cons: - freezing (but hey, it's winter) - hour long wait for food to arrive, even though the restaurant was empty"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  I don't think I have ever had a better appetizer than the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers.  The meals don't look that big but I ended up not being able to finish my delicious enchiladas.   The service was a bit slow and even getting water took a little too long."}
{"text":"We were in search of something different than the usual \"greasy spoon \" breakfast so thought we'd give El Dorado a try. My wife had the Ranch Hand, which I thought would be boring.  But she loved it. Everything was fresh and not greasy. I had the breakfast burrito with refried beans and potatoes.  It was excellent!  And the house made sauce was really tasty. Great atmosphere.  We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time with some friends a few weeks ago and I'm definitely a fan! I loved the flaky chips with salsa to start with. I'd say the only downside is that the items are a little pricey, but they are delicious! I did the vegetable and goat cheese empanadas, and I have to say that a week later, I'm craving them (so obviously, they come highly recommended). I wasn't able to enjoy some alcoholic beverages (as I'm pregnant), but saw that they have a key lime margarita for dessert, which I plan to enjoy soon! I split the pecan pie for dessert, which was a good substitute for the tempting alcoholic drink. Our server was friendly and attentive. They close relatively early during the week (9 PM), so make sure to start your dinner off early enough. Definitely would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I was reading my old review from a few years ago (can't believe its been 7 years) and I thought I would update. My wife and I both love the Eldorado Grill - have been here a number of times over the years and have always enjoyed ourselves. Good food, good service - lots of fun.  Recently we tried their breakfast with some friends. Very yummy. Traditional items as well as some with some spice and some original ones too. I've also returned many times for their Brisket which is always good.  The place is a bit small - but we've managed to not really had to wait very much. We tend to avoid high traffic hours/days though so keep it in mind and make reservations if you can."}
{"text":"Sorry but the food was very bland I had the enchiladas with Mole and Verde and it was bland the beans were bland the best thing was the salsa so I dumped salsa on everything my wife had pulled pork sandwich and it was only OK very doubtful I'll be back pretty disappointed.  This is on the food fight restaurant group they probably should be removed."}
{"text":"If you are wondering if this is a good Mexican or Tex/Mex place, yes it sure is.  The food is delicious, with some traditional items on the menu and a few you might not expect.  It's price very well for the value you get out of the experience.  Great for groups and parties or date night.  They have some great margaritas and mezcal on the menu too.  It's a hip and fun scene."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for years and was quite pleased to re-connect for a GREAT dinner on a Monday night. Not crowded...fast service and really TASTY food. The salsa sampler is still the best, however the SMALL portion of Guacamole was gobbled up much too quickly for the price. The Steak was perfect and the Bleu Cheese butter topping was decadent and delightful, as were the  collard greens and whipped taters!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places downtown for Mexican/Tex-mex. The brunch is one of my favorites. They've got something on the menu for everyone. Their margaritas pack a punch, but in a good way. They have several dozes of kinds of tequila. Always a good time and delicious food."}
{"text":"Long story short, I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat.  I visited after a recommendation from a friend. We had a Food Fight Restaurant Group gift card, so we decided to try Eldorado Grill.  The atmosphere is a southern/cool/cozy/modern sort of feel. It was loud, which didn't bother me, but might some people. Lighting very interesting. Just overall, the ambiance is unique.  All of the food we ate was great. The salsa had an interesting smokey flavor to it. (Ancho?) And as simple as the typical side dishes of rice and beans may seem, even those were fantastic!   Service was great, food was wonderful, and I hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"O em gee!  Currently my favorite place to eat in Madison and worthy of my first review as a Madison Elite.  We are not planners when it comes to eating out. I don't make reservations or plan a few days or weeks in advance but reading the yelp reviews and the recommendations from fellow yelper's I had to try this place out. (Note: make reservations, you will not be sorry)  We arrived a half hour early for dinner and decided to walk down towards the lake there was a play area there to entertain the toddler and tire her out/make her hungry for dinner.   Now being vegetarians we are used to seeing the token 1 or 2 dishes on a menu or a note that they can make a few things vegetarian upon request. I was surprised to see at least 5 choices without modifications and all with different flavor profiles.   Service - We were seated promptly. Our server was very friendly and attentive. With our free chips and salsa (yelp check in offer) we asked if they had any spicy salsa's... she said she would be right back and came back with a tray of three different kinds. Our favorite was the pineapple habanero it starts off sweet and ends with an explosive 'cold' spicy  finish. The others were smokey adobo flavored with varying levels of smokiness.   Food - the toddler got beans and cheese taco with corn cakes on the side (we are raising a food snob). She loved the corn cakes! I ordered corn quesadilla, my mom got poblano peppers stuffed with quinoa and sweet potatoes and the hubby got spinach mushroom enchiladas. The verde sauce on the enchiladas were the bomb!! Delicious food!! We heard brunch is even better (a little hard to believe after a 5 star dinner) but I loveeee me some brunch so we are definitely coming back for that.   Drinks - DAMNNNN they do not skimp on that tequila and mezcal. Mama likey! I was plenty happy with my 1 margarita. Sigh I've become a lightweight."}
{"text":"Mmmazing food! The brisket was by far the most tender and flavorful I have ever tasted. Totally worth the money and the wait. Excellent service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have come here 5 times over the past 15 years years. Every time I come I have high hopes. Every time I am very disappointed. Over priced, poor tasting food. After tonight, I told my husband, NEVER again."}
{"text":"Love: The decor, the vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options along with classic BBQ, the overall theme of the place, nice staff, fabulous house margarita. Meh: The food was good, but not \"we spent thirty bucks on our meal\" good, the rice was scooped onto the plate like mashed potatoes, table was a tidbit rickety making for a few light spills. Hate: Nothing I could really hate with this place to be honest. Everything was between 'meh' and 'love,' definitely earning a solid four stars.  Advice: Check in with Yelp and get a free bowl of chips and salsa, try the house margarita if you drink alcohol, and keep in mind that the portion sizes are, for me anyway, the perfect amount of filling. Not painful, just, satisfied and full.  Note for gluten free folks: Note on the menu mentions something about things coming into contact with gluten being a possibility in the back. Good to know before you go if it's a big dietary restriction.   Vegetarian/vegan options are expansive."}
{"text":"Great for Tex Mex. Had the chile relleno, which was great. The rice and beans were great. My friends had a plate with Eldorado's chipotle potato salad - AWESOME! The corn bread pancakes are a cool twist on just pain corn bread."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and their bleu cheese steak with kale is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great for brunch, margaritas, bloody Mary's, and good Tex Mex food. A little on the pricey side, but worth it. Love getting the tacos, or any egg meal. Service is friendly, fast. Lone star beers are cheap. Ask for the Yelp deal for free chips and salsa, add the guacamole. If you have 6 or more, get reservations."}
{"text":"Tasty cocktails, filling portions. Service was a little slow, but friendly. The hostess predicted a 45 minute wait but it was only about 20, so don't be too afraid!"}
{"text":"We visit Eldorado almost every Sunday for brunch, just to have the mango-pinnalple, it's incredible.  My boyfriend decided to celebrate his birthday with a party of 15; I called, made the reservations and staff were great.  I asked if we could have the french toast as cake and they made it happended, it was incredible! Thank you to our waitress Stephanie and the team, special thanks to the manager, Tony! Memorable brunch celebration."}
{"text":"So, my husband and I decided to try Eldorado out tonight and it was...interesting.   We ordered the Street taco appetizer, Seafood Enchiladas, the Big Texan, a raspberry Margarita, diet pepsi, and a ginger beer.   The Enchiladas were fantastic. It was basically crab dip, rolled in a tortilla and fried.  The street tacos were good.  HOWEVER, the BBQ was terrible. Just, not good. It came with a \"cornbread\" style pancake, shredded red cabbage disguised as slaw, sliced pickles, raw sliced onions, beans, and chipotle potato salad. Overall, the sides were quite bland and underwhelming. The ribs were dry, had very little \"peach bbq sauce,\" and they tasted kind of weird. I'm not sure if this pork was old or what, but I've had a lot of BBQ in my life as a Southerner and there was something wrong with that pork. The brisket was okay, but certainly not something I would come back for. The pulled pork was mediocre and also a bit dry.  The drinks were pretty good, from what I could tell. I enjoyed mine and it seemed like everyone had a Margarita, so they must be doing something right.  Our waiter, Mikayla (I don't know if that's how you spell it) was very pleasant and apologized a few times when our food was so late, which we appreciated, even though it seemed like an unusually long time before our entrees arrived.  In summary, drinks, service and enchiladas- good. BBQ-very, very bad.   I would advise management to scrap the BBQ and focus on the Tex-Mex side."}
{"text":"Liked this place a lot. Hands down an impressive place for brunch.  Vegetarians rejoice. There are so many non-meat options on their brunch menu. And most of their meat options can be made vegetarian. They have the classic flap jacks and French toast but also Mexican inspired brunch options. Yum, yum, yum.  I went with the Eldarado eggs but got my eggs over medium instead of poached. It was served with a side of really delicious potatoes and a salad (which I didn't care much for but I'm not the biggest fan of salads). My meal was pretty close to perfect. The eggs were done just right and were nicely complemented by the corn cake. My meal was washed down with a well made mango mimosa. They even have \"brunch\" margaritas on the menu. Cause brunch at a Mexican restaurant will not be complete without margaritas. The other parties at my table at the breakfast burrito and the migas. They also both had the bloody Mary and had raves about it.   The general consensus at the end of the meal was that Eldorado Grill is a must visit AGAIN for brunch. There are so many other things that look amazing on the menu and I can't wait to try them!"}
{"text":"Again, fabulous food and service.   I love the chips and salsa but this time dinner included tamales, brisket, and smoked, grilled chicken enchiladas.  Everything was excellent!  Tried \"The Elmo\" (mojito with tequila) and it was awesome.  I highly recommend thinking ahead and making a reservation.  It seems there is always some sort of wait, and the only real downfall of this place is limited space to wait or get a drink while waiting."}
{"text":"This is a favorite brunch spot with friends. Two words: eldorado eggs.  They have a pretty fun&unique brunch menu with a lot of non-standard options - so you are bound to try something new. Bloody Marys are really good, but I recommend the Bloody Maria... It's an adventure. Also of note- they have a robust tequila selection as well.  The service is generally good , however drinks always take a while.  I wouldn't go out of your way to go here, but if you live in Madison, make a stop sometime. (disclaimer- I've never eaten dinner here)"}
{"text":"My parents, boyfriend, and I tried out the Eldorado Grille for brunch one Sunday and boy, was it amazing!   Food- Outstanding!! Service- Eh, but that may have been due to the fact that the restaurant was crazy busy.  Overall? A wonderful place to eat. We will definitely be back soon!!  P.S. If you go for breakfast, get a coffee and French Toast! It's to die for!!"}
{"text":"I had been to El Dorado once about 12 years ago, and recently re-visted it for Restaurant Week 2012.  I have to say, the reviews I have read here that complain about a bad atmosphere, overpriced food, and poor waitstaff must've had a very different experience than I did.  First, we were seated quickly, even though we were about 15 minutes early for our reservation.  We were waited on quickly, and our food came out in the same manner.  I understand why some might complain about overpriced food, as some of the entrees are almost $20.00.  However, I like to think of myself as a thrifty consumer, and I believe you can easily come here and get an appetizer and entree for two people and be easily sated.  Just don't order too much food and you won't pay too much.  Simple.  Disclosure:  I. Love. Nachos.    The pork nachos were out of this world.  Priced just under $8.00, they were plenty for two or three people to share as an appetizer.  They were a bit messy, but I'm not above finger/plate licking when it comes to delicious food.   My dining partner ordered all vegetarian food, and she was VERY pleased with, a.) their  accommodation and b.) how tasty the alternatives were.   Great place to go if you're a meat-eater and your dining companion is a vegetarian.  Some of her food looked better than mine!  All in all, they had out of this world pork on each pork-centric dish I ordered.  The smoked pulled pork was fantastic, and I could barely finish half of the serving.  It comes with an unusual 4 sides (coleslaw, chipotle potato salad, pinto beans, and a light corn pancake).  Who thought this wasn't enough food??  I had two meals after taking home more than half of my plate.  The atmosphere was unpretentious, lively, and a great place to just have a chat with a friend.  Visit El Dorado soon if you haven't been there already."}
{"text":"BRUNCH-ONLY REVIEW:  Driving thru town, starving; needed brunch! I am really glad I decided to stop here. The food was delicious. And the portions large.  I had a biscuit+gravy dish (can't recall the name of the plate) with a fried egg on one half of the biscuit and a sausage patty on the other side of the biscuit. Very good! The gravy was perfect. My egg was over-easy and runny like I love, and the sausage patty was delish.  Also came with breakfast potatoes. Total: $10. Wooo!  If I were coming here again I'd definitely eat here for brunch again."}
{"text":"Brunch is El Dorado's savior.  As a food fight restaurant goes, I still think they have the worst service of any.  I would give their service a six, and their food and 8."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and loved it, and came here again last night for restaurant week. We made a reservation for 6 people, but had to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table once we got there. The staff were very understanding, however, and gave us a round of free drinks as an apology! I had the pork stew, salmon, and pecan pie. Everything was delicious! Some friends ordered the jalepeno torpedos as an appetizer, and I really can't say whether I liked those or the pork stew more. The salmon was cooked well, but it wasn't at all Mexican. The pecan pie was also delicious, but at that point I was so full from everything else that I could barely eat it. Some friends got the Mexican coke float, and it was oddly spicey. I didn't care for it, but some of them really liked it.  The portions were big, everything we ordered was delicious, and the staff was very friendly. The cocktails were also really tasty, I definitely recommend getting one if you come!   I can't wait to come back! I heard brunch is good too, so I want to try that next."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are always first class. It's not my favorite place because it's so crowed most of the time and it's hard to get to the bar for a drink. On this night I had a half of chicken on some Brussel sprouts and other stuff I don't remember and it was very good. My partner had the Onie,( is that how you spell it?), a huge chunk of white fish with a nice sauce around it and some rice on the side. She said it was great and took half home. Service was good. It is noisy here and hard to hear everything she said so I was doing the, nod, nod as if I could hear. So much for the specials. I wish they printed them so I could read them."}
{"text":"The only place in town that offers a wide variety of margaritas with fresh squeezed lime juice- you'll never think about the pre-made blended margaritas at cheap mexican restaurants the same again after you've tasted what a real margarita should taste like.  Coupled with real Texas-style BBQ (the pulled pork is incredible), a giant pork burrito, or the famous Seafood enchiladas, I always leave feeling satisfied and stuffed.  The atmosphere is fun, especially on busy Fridays and Saturdays with old country music playing in the background, but also classy and unique compared to most mexican places in Madison.  The service is fast and personable, the homemade salsa is enough to keep me coming back, and the giant wall of tequila makes this an exciting experience that differs from some of the cookie-cutter Food Fight restaurants.    The brunch menu is also inexpensive for a ton of filling, delicious, unique food- I highly suggest the Eldorado Benedict with the pasilla hollandaise sauce!  The negative reviews seem to have a common theme: they each ordered the most boring things on a very extensive menu (chicken enchilladas or one of the kinds of tacos) and then were disappointed when they weren't incredible.  Well yes, if you want to order a tortilla with some veggies and meat on it, you won't be blown away because it's a boring meal for boring people.  Instead, expand your horizons to ANYTHING else on the menu, something that you couldn't make at home in 5 minutes, and you will be impressed.  At the very least, go for the fajitas or burritos- not too extravagant but huge and delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner and drinks and also their brunch. Both experiences were very good, it's a great atmosphere and the food has been good each time. Brunch is always very busy, so be prepared for a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best margaritas in the city; in fact, the only places I've had the like were in Phoenix and San Francisco.  Great tequilas.  The chips and salsa complement the drinks very well and are much, much better than what you get at chain Mexican restaurants.  The entrees are a bit pricey (for which I docked a star; the food and drinks are a 5) , but they're quite good and beautifully presented.  Vegetarian entrees are clearly marked.  There are two different vegetarian enchiladas--both with spinach, which is a little confusing--but they are equally delicious and very fresh-tasting.  The black beans and Mexican rice served with most entrees are okay, but not spectacular.  The only entree that has ever disappointed me was the Thai vegetable fajitas (I just didn't like the flavor).  I do wish they had a different vegetarian fajita, because I love fajitas.   The desserts are amazing.  If you love chocolate, try the chocolate cherry bread pudding--but be sure to share it with someone else; it's enormous."}
{"text":"Eldorado Grill is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. You really can't order anything bad here if you try. It's great for happy hour, brunch, or dinner. The spicy margarita is not kidding, it is SPICY. They have a ton of different bloody mary options. One of my friends swears by the huevos rancheros. Personally, I'm dying to try the blue corn flap jacks. Eldorado is a great restaurant to impress your out-of-town friends when you want to skip the usual cheese curds and beer. It's a popular spot though, so it's good to have a reservation."}
{"text":"CRAZY overpriced unappealing boring entrees with a pretentious atmosphere...move on...  there are way way WAAYYY better choices in town."}
{"text":"Lobster, shrimp, and crab enchiladas were AMAZING!!!! Eldorado margarita was also very good. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was incredible. I definitely will be back. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Eldorado for a late-night bite and some margaritas.  It did not disappoint.  The drinks were very fresh (no margarita mix here).  They have a wide variety of tequilas and mixed drink options to choose from.  I stuck with the house margarita and some nachos to share.  I've heard brunch is very good.  It may be time for another trip to Madison!"}
{"text":"Two brunch visits. Food comes to table barely warm. Bland potatoes that are made way too far ahead. Not worth the time."}
{"text":"Overall: A solid brunch option (and surely solid dinner option), not necessarily authentic Mexican but still great!  The good: Great food at a very good price. All of the brunch options were delicious and pretty cheap. The portion sizes are great as well. The service is very friendly and the atmosphere was solid and interesting. Also they played good music.  The bad: The food took a very long time to come out for a 4-top. No to-go cups for iced tea.   Atmosphere: 9/10 Service: 8/10 Food: 8/10"}
{"text":"Note: this review is specifically for brunch.  El Dorado is one of the few restaurants my picky friend loves to go to for brunch, so I come here relatively often. He always gets the yuppie hash, and is just so darn happy and joyous when he gets it that it just makes me happy!  Otherwise, to be honest, I don't know if they would be in my standard Madison brunch rotation. The food is fine, don't get me wrong, but it's just never really what I'm craving. I often peruse the menu and think, well, okay, I suppose I'll get this. When I have it, it's usually good, but my brunch enthusiasm is lower than normal here. I've started getting their scramble specials lately and that's been working out, but I never wake up and think, oh man, I'm just dying for something from El Dorado! When I'm in a boozy mood, I like their bloody mary.  Biggest plus to the place for me is that they take reservations for brunch, which is a serious plus when most brunch spots in Madison are 1) tiny and 2) don't take reservations so you're forced to wait. This is the place I'd take 6 of my best friends if we wanted a solid place where we wouldn't have to risk possibly not finding a spot for the next hour. You need a reservation though, because otherwise you'll be waiting... Forever.  Summary: fine food, best served with a reservation for a large party."}
{"text":"Had the famous bluecorn flap jacks. The chili added an interesting and subtle layer of taste, which matches well with the sweetness of butter and syrup, but I would say it could be more spicy... The bluecorn gave the pancakes nice aroma, and it tastes better than any plain flour/ whole wheat pancake I've had before."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a group of friends and it was pretty good.  Very good for a Sunday morning recovery after a late Saturday.  I was excited because I love chilaquiles and it's hard to find that on a menu.   They were excellent.  Great flavor, great texture, and overall great dish.  Highly recommend for brunch in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm an admitted cheapskate and have only been for the happy hour, but man, is it a great happy hour. The margaritas are much better than any other place nearby (read: on State St. or at Francisco's Cantina, though I love them in every other way). The food deals are tremendous. You can enjoy a very large plate of steak tacos for dinner if you don't mind eating on a geriatric dining schedule (e.g. before 6:30 pm). A vegetarian friend said the popovers were the best vegetarian dish she'd had at a Mexican or Tex Mex place in town. It's not going to provoke any profound food revelations, but it's a fun spot that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the bomb.com! Great atmosphere, service is wonderful! Food is delicious, bacon blueberry pancakes are amazingggg and so are their breakfast margaritas! GO HERE FOR BRUNCH! Won't regret promise :)"}
{"text":"The best Tex-Mex I've had in Madison so far. Interesting menu and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My second time here. Late night at the end of Restaurant Week. Their menu looked interesting so I thought I would check it out plus it was close to my apartment and status post work. A long day at work. There was a huge delay in receiving my entree status post my appetizer. Appetizer was okay. I got the pork adobo with red rice. Most flavorful thing that I have had here. I would recommend it if it is on the main menu. I also got the street taco and the lemon and jalapeno pie. They were mediocre in my opinion. My waitress Shelby was nice but you could tell I was not a priority, as the other waitresses were closing their shift and she was staying till close. Ok place if you are looking for a potentially slow approach dinner."}
{"text":"Unquestionably the best slow braised pork I've ever had - MUST GET the pork adobo!!!! Service, space, and food phenomenal."}
{"text":"The Food at eldorado is quite good. It's definatly on the American side of the Tex/Mex fence with a lot of seafood options and some traditional bbq options. I had a salmon thing and a bacon/jalepeneo appetizer but the entire menu looked good. The black beans and rice were OK, but next time I'll try a different side.    Also our server was smoking cute, the whole staff looked to be, so go here.   I haven't found a ton of great standard mexican places in Madison, that's what I was hoping for at el dorado. It's not really that, but what it is is pleasant in it's own unique way."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Horrible front-end service."}
{"text":"Food was great! My sisters and I loved the spice on the chicken and pulled pork! Chips and salsa were delicious as well! :)"}
{"text":"I went here for Date Night with the boy.  I'd never been, and he couldn't remember if he'd ever gone before or not.  It was a Thursday just before 7, and it was extremely busy.  We still got a table right away, fortunately, because we were both ravenous.  The table was not a good one.  I can't say I care for the way the restaurant is laid out.  We were smack dab in the middle of the room, which meant my chair was mere inches from another diner's chair, and waitstaff was always squeezing by.  It was very noisy, too.  Additionally, our waitress was training another waitress, but they weren't always together...so, they would each come check on the table, causing us to be interrupted an awful lot.  We each got a margarita on the rocks (very good, but pricey), and chips & salsa.  The chips & salsa were less than $2, and while I'm used to having them included in my Mexican restaurant eating excursions, they were well worth the added expense.  I believe both the chips and salsa are homemade, and are extremely tasty.  The boy wound up getting the pork burrito, I had the chicken & mushroom burrito.  It was a Burrito Bonanza!  Surprisingly, both of the burritos tasted different.  Mine had the very prevalent flavors of roasted chicken and corn.  His was more delicately smoky.  Both very good.  The portions were enormous, as they included black beans and rice.  I was pleasantly surprised that the black beans were just that, and not actually refried goo.  There was so much food that I couldn't finish, and that was a welcome change of pace.  Overall, it was a positive experience.  I just wish the atmosphere had been different.  The food in and of itself merited at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place probably should get a 3 star rather than a 4 star, but I'm a fan.    I've only been here for brunch, but I've heard negative and unenthusiastic reviews from friends who were there for dinner.  I imagine that their non-brunch menu isn't worth coming in for.    This place is a bit of a hit and miss when it comes to the food.  I usually order the El Dorado eggs when I'm there because I'm a big fan of poached eggs and the lime scallion sauce they drizzle over the eggs is way way better than any hollandaise sauce.  The corn cakes is also a much better choice than any biscuit.  However, the poaching of the eggs is often hit or miss.  At times the eggs are perfectly runny, at other times, they've come out completely cooked.  Really, why poach an egg if it's not runny?    I really enjoy their bloody marys as well and their extra spicy bloody mary is a solid spicy but not peppery kick."}
{"text":"Impressive tequila selection and tasty food. The Baja fish tacos were not what I would consider socal style, but it was a good taco none the less. Rice and corn cakes are lacking, but everything else was great. Guacamole and chips were on point. We will be back."}
{"text":"My fiancé has been wanting to come here for awhile. By checking in with yelp we got the chips and salsa for free which was nice. For drinks I got a glass if champagne and he got the smoking gun. Wow. Could definitely taste the tequila in his drink. For dinner I got the grilled lobster, shrimp and crab enchilada. I wish they would have had a thinner wrap around them. The mild taste of the seafood was overwhelmed by it so it was hard to taste. But it was good. He ordered the pan seared tenderloin with chipotle blue butter and a side of scallops. I normally don't like scallops but I tried them and they were good. I also tried his mash potatoes which had garlic (always a good thing). Our server was good but nothing amazing. Prices are a little high."}
{"text":"Fun place for brunch.  Different western feel.  All breakfast type food is good: sausage, bacon, french toast, breakfast potatoes, biscuits, eggs all are well above average in comparison to other diners"}
{"text":"This place is really good. House margarita was potent and fresh-tasting.  I ate the street tacos (3) steak and chorizo and while they could have added more meat in the tacos, they were still terrific.  I was still hungry after the tacos and had a bowl of chili - really good.   I will go back.  Why not 5 stars?  This is Wisconsin Mexican food - not So CA or TX!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town here after work with my coworkers.   Nice place, food was pretty good.  I got the BBQ Peach Pork dinner WOW I was impressed!  I'd get it again, pork was thick soft and juicy.  Greens were not overly cooked and flavorful, the relish on top was cold and fresh and the mash potato was thick and creamy not like out of a box taste.  The apps were good and the drinks were even better.  We ordered and shared (2) slices of pecan pies, it was warm and a lot of pecans yummy! Staff was friendly and helpful of the menu. Since I was visiting, I'd go back and try other things.  My coworkers enjoyed all the \"pork\" orders more flavorful than the beef.  Tacos were good.  Not fond of paying for chips and salsa though.  I would think it comes with ordering a meal."}
{"text":"I went for brunch, and i really liked it! The place really plays up the tex mex decorations with horseshoes and tequila on the wall.  I ordered the chicken and biscuit. The biscuit was delicious. It was fluffy and warm, but its not the flaky, buttery kind. The chicken was moist fried thigh meat that tasted like a buttermilk fried chicken. These two thing were tooped with gravy and green onions with eggs and a side of spicy fried potatoes. This was an awesome dish! It really hit the spot for a savory brunch dish. I wish that there was more gavy since the biscuit was so big that the bottom half didnt get any gravy on it, but thats a small change.  Bonus points for their hot sauce. They take it very seriously. I got the pureed chipotle; a great way to add some spicy, zesty, smokiness to your eggs and potatoes!"}
{"text":"Visiting Madison from Chicago. We enjoyed our first dinner here. V friendly server and food is fantastic. I am a vegeterian and they have great options for me as well."}
{"text":"I've never had a real breakfast in Madison so a real breakfast was a must.   Service   We were greeted and seated immediately. Overall service was great our server was very attentive. We were checked on frequently.   Food   My order consisted of french toast, and a chicken quesadilla and oh yeah, free chips and salsa when you check in with yelp! The french toast was on point, not too soggy and not too hard. The chicken quesadilla on the other hand didn't live up to my expectations. It was overloaded with sour cream, there was little to no tomatoes, but the chicken was juicy and tender.   Pricing   Pricing wasn't too bad although I do think 6 slices of average French Toast for $7 dollars was a bit on the pricy end.    Decor    Full bar, reminded me of a loft, plenty of seating area. Overall atmosphere was great.   Parking  Free street parking, very easy to find.    Overall  Food was average Service was great  Overall environment and atmosphere was awesome"}
{"text":"I love the margaritas here.  I also like the chips and dip.  This place is best utilized at happy hour, for that reason."}
{"text":"Eldorado Grill used to be my FAVORITE  restaurant in Madison.  I have lived here for 11 years.  We went tonight for Father's Day because this was my only request for this day.  The hostess was terrible, our waitress was terrible, they were out of some food on the menu and MOST importantly, even though they were aware that they were screwing up the night, they did nothing.  They abandoned our table, drinks sat empty, food came after 1 hour of waiting - totally F$#@cked up!!!.   After years of going to this restaurant I will NEVER go back.  Thanks for F@#$cking up my Father's Day."}
{"text":"The margaritas here are the best!  You have to pay for the chips & salsa, which kinda seems wierd ... but the chips are amazing and the salsa is awesome, so its definately worth it!  The chicken mushroom burrito is very good.  I get it everytime  This place has good, and very friendly service at bar & tables."}
{"text":"Eldorado Grill on Willy St, just blocks away from \"the square\" and the Wisconsin State capitol building, is always bustling and ready to please.  Tonight we sampled the World famous - Eldorado margarita (s) -  made with 100% agave house tequila, fresh-squeezed lime and Patron Citronge, served on the rocks - fresh and delicious.  Although the chips and salza are a small fee rather than \"free\", I'd encourage you to try them - the chips are made \"in-house\" and so is the \"signature\" salsa - full bodied, not too hot, a little smoke, a little heat - for that just right flavor.  She had the mushroom spinach enchilada with mole sauce and I had the Kansas city, dry rubbed , slow smoked baby back ribs, served with a light Kentucky style sauce - served to perfection.  Dalton was our server, polite, efficient - did a great job.  We enjoyed our visit to Eldorado and enjoyed the comfortable hospitality.  Stop by the Eldorado grill the next time you are downtown Madison - I know you'll enjoy your visit"}
{"text":"Slow service, but pretty decent food. I really like the Yuppie Hash with a poached egg on top, but it is a little bit spicy for my wimpy tastes.The blue corn cakes are unique and perfect as an inexpensive a la carte breakfast. Free flowing coffee and no pressure to rush through your meal makes it a great place for a group breakfast or brunch. I've never been for dinner but I have heard really good things."}
{"text":"We've visited the Eldorado Grill on many occasions so we have a reliable benchmark.  Our visit this evening was OK but not excellent.  Service was very good.   Drinks were very good.   That was not the issue.   The dinners themselves were just average.   My wife had the fish tacos, a dish she uses to judge places since it is one of her favorites.   These were just average.   In comparison those she had a week ago at Waypoint in Madison were much better. My Pescado Veracruz was nicely prepared and presented.   But the mahi-mahi was overdone rendering it dry and tasteless.    We'll be back but this was a bit disappointing"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's our go-to place for dinner. The food is always good.  It's a challenge for me to try new menu items because I have favorites that I always want to reorder.  The margaritas are really tasty and can be dangerous if you're not careful.  The servers are knowledgeable and eager to please. The bar area is usually crowded but that's fine with me and part of the whole picture. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  I like that it's a little noisy.  I always make reservations.in advance.  Kevin Tubbs' cookbooks are also great and allow us to try to recreate the menu items at home."}
{"text":"Semi-vegan-friendly mexican food, great salsa and guac, everything else so-so.  Chips - 3 stars (not made fresh inhouse, or, if so, for shame)  Salsa - 5 stars (although I didn't like being charged for it -- should be included in the price of the margaritas)  Guacamole - 5 stars  Margaritas - 3 stars (\"house\" blanco is a bit off, the Sweetie's that was made with Chinaco was better)  Vegan quinoa stuffed poblano - 3 stars (white quinoa was flavorless, red/black quinoa would have helped as would a sauce/mole; black beans also needed more flavor)  Service - 3.5 stars (our waitress was very friendly but didn't really have any idea about the margarita ingredients)  +1 star for being a mexican restaurant with the word vegan on the menu (very rare!)  -0.5 stars for vegan items being only \"optionally\" vegan, using fake meat in the vegan chili, and not having a vegan dessert  +0.5 for stocking nearly every single mezcal  Although there was lots of room for improvement, I can't think of a better vegan friendly mexican restaurant (anywhere), so I think they deserve a 5 star \"as good as it gets\"."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying Eldorado is by far one my favorite restaurants in Madison.  I have been to Eldorado a hand full of times already. The biggest thing to note is that if you plan on going on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night, you will most likely want to call ahead to make reservations. It is usually pretty busy.   The food is always great. I always try to have something new when I go and I have never been disappointed. Brunch is also very good.  One of the really great aspects of this restaurant/bar is their drinks. They specialize in tequila and their house margarita is especially tasty!  If you haven't tried Eldorado, I would highly suggest it"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review of Eldorado Grill yet?! If I were to pick a restaurant in madison that was my favorite this would likely be it!   I've dined here more times than I can count. Each time has been delicious. Even though this is my favorite restaurant there are still some things I should note (that might be deal breakers for some). 1) there is often a wait, so I would recommend making a reservation if you are limited on time.  2) when it is busy it is often loud, which can make it a little hard to have a conversation. 3) if you're not a fan of tequila, you might be out of luck (liquor wise).   Back on to some positives. The brunch, did you hear me... THE BRUNCH! You must try their brunch. The banana pecan French toast is to die for! It has the perfect amount of crunch, and not overly sweet. There is enough to split, well to be honest, it's perfect to share when you can split another equally delicious option.   The potato pancakes are unique, texture wise, but full of flavor. You can't go wrong with any dish off the menu. The enchiladas are super flavorful and the potato's have the right amount of seasoning.   If you come for dinner you have to order the Texas torpedoes. They are like an upgrade to your traditional jalapeño poppers."}
{"text":"Eldorado is somewhere I think I like, until I go again and remember the mediocrity. I've given up on the pancakes(a former love of mine), because they are SO ginourmous, that they are always doughy and rawish in the middle. You're reduced to eating around the edges.   So, my other brunch dishes have been alright, but I've I'm driving over to the East Side, I'll drive a few more feet and go to Madison Sourdough."}
{"text":"There are so many things good about this place that I could go on and on. Instead, I will leave you with my favorites.  Margaritas Cheesy grits Chicken enchiladas with a scrambled egg on top for brunch Blue corn pancakes Corn quesadillas  Spicy Bloody Maria's  Breakfast potatoes  Street tacos Free parking  Reservations and call aheads accepted   You're welcome."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Eldorado off & on for years. I am definitely a fan on quite a broad scope. I've always enjoyed:  ~ Their Titorita (they are ideal for me as I prefer vodka to tequila) ~ Their amazing fried chicken (perfectly crispy without the greasy factor & very balanced seasoning) ~ Their brunch (Eldorado eggs, YUM) ~ And their Bloody Mary (one of best in town, and I don't even like Bloody Mary's).  However, the reason for my review on this particular day is the unbelievable meal my husband and I had last Saturday. It was their special of the night and it really was perfect - we wouldn't have changed a thing. Literally - not one thing! Well, the only thing I would have changed is that I would've taken a photo for all of you to gaze upon, but I was so excited about the food, I totally forgot. Okay okay, time for details.  The special was a thick cut New York Strip with tarragon butter, a side of asparagus and their oh-so-good garlic mashed potatoes. It was such phenomenally prepared food that I actually wanted to scream, with happiness obviously, but I held it in so as not to scare the other customers. So here I am happily Yelping rather than yelling.  ;o)  The steak was tender & SO flavorful - prepared exactly as we both requested (medium rare). I'm pretty sure it had been marinated as well due to the colossal flavor profile. The tarragon butter melting on top of the steak just sealed the deal. Too good!!! The asparagus was sweet, a bit crisp and dressed with a light yet spicy oil. GOOD! And, as always, their garlic mashed potatoes never disappoint. It truly was a perfect meal - one of the best I've ever had at Eldorado. Here's to more of that!  P.S. Our server was excellent!"}
{"text":"Brunch review: Our table ordered the Hit the Trail Flapjacks and the Corn Quesadilla. Flapjacks: We've eaten a lot of pancakes in Madison, and these rank among some of the most novel. They contain lots of seeds, nuts, and dried fruits, as well as topped with red chile butter (TBH, couldn't taste the red chile aspect much). Excellent. Quesadilla: Really liked the fact that it was made with a yellow corn tortilla rather than a standard flour tortilla. Black beans also rounded it out nicely.   Dinner:  Sorry to say I don't have a distinct memory of dinner, ate their quite a while ago.  However, my companion and I both remember that the meat quality seemed higher than most other BBQ meals. However, I could have sworn that they said their BBQ pork came from Jordandal farms. Now I don't see that anywhere on the menu.  Overall we enjoyed our meal and will come back."}
{"text":"Good Ritas, but the meal was a litte underwhelming. My rice and beans seemed to have that look of having been plated hours previously and the pork tacos had no real zing. My wife's rellano was nice but had one too many cheeses stuffed in it. Eat inside for more comfortable tables."}
{"text":"There is always a hesitancy when I go to Food Fight restaurants.  Overall, I feel the restaurants in the group are hit and miss and I always find an excuse to go somewhere else.  Luckily, I threw caution to the wind and brunched it up a few Sundays ago.  Maybe I set the bar too low but left impressed with what we had. As it is never too early to drink bloody mary's, EG serves up some great ones.  I had the spicier version (Killer Bloody Murder) and it fit the bill.  With housemade chili vodka, a mass of skewered vegetables, and a beer chaser, I was pleased with my selection.  I then followed it up with a mezcal and grapefruit drink called the Paloma which also didn't disappoint. Now, onto the food.  As I like to eat myself into a food induced coma, I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken Biscuit.  Served with house potatoes, the chicken is topped with a fried egg, cheddar cheese and topped with a country gravy.  Yes, the calorie count was infinity but it tasted amazing.  My friend ordered the Migas.  She was a big fan.  Living in Austin, I feel they don't quite match up to the legendary dish served up at Ciscos, but they come close.  Starting with scrambled eggs with poblano peppers, onions, cheese, and tortilla strips, Eldorado steps it up and tops it with bacon.   All in all, we had a great meal.  Overly stuffed, slightly buzzed.  What more can you ask for on a Sunday morning?"}
{"text":"Eldorado for Brunch! Need I say more?  The food was excellent. The service was lovely. And the place was packed! Call for a reservation or to get your name on the list. Ask your server for the specials of the day. I highly recommend the Eggs Benedict and the Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Delicious and great service! I hadn't drank anything all day and was draining my water every few minutes. My server was on top of it, filling my glass constantly.  And the food. Oh wow was it good. There were 4 of us and we were all happy as clams. I got the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were amazing. They have corn tortillas, and are grilled and crispy. The sauce comes underneath. Others god the lobster, shrimp enchiladas. Also grilled. Also awesome. I also got a bite of the blackened catfish. It had a nice burn to it and was cooked to perfection -- flaky and melts in your mouth.  I will definitely be back to try the pulled pork."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and the food is always good and the margaritas are even better. Papa always gets the catfish. I love the chips and salsa (spicy salsa!). We went on a Friday night and it was packed. The staff was bustling and the patrons were happy. I love that atmosphere especially when nights are starting to get chilly."}
{"text":"I've been working in Madison for over 4 years and just discovered El Dorado. Do not miss this place. The flavors they are creating are like nothing else in the city. If you're in the mood for Southwestern dishes with an interesting twist this is your new go-to spot. We sampled the torpedoes, jalapeno peppers stuffed with a shrimp and Monterey jack cheese and the guacamole and both were great. Add in some chips and salsa, with crispy thin tortilla chips, and you're in for a good start. From there our group had the AMAZING Adobo Pork, the crusted chicken, and filet. All raved about the flavors and portions, definitely a place to go when you're hungry. This place has entered my top 5 of Madison restaurants, I just wish I had found it years ago!"}
{"text":"Yeah, um, why haven't I been here in so long.  Forgot how great it is and was reminded that the prices are very reasonable.  I loved the Pork Burrito and my wife was just as fond of the Chicken Fried Chicken.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Still LOVE it here!!! I don't think my life would be complete without the fish tacos and the corn cake...mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Protip- Make a reservation for bunch if you want a table, or be prepared to park-it at the bar to avoid the wait. Rookie mistake. This place was hoppin on a Sunday morning.  Madisonians love their brunch and Eldorado delivers.  I'm a huge fan of eggs and tex-mex, so this really did it for me. Also, by sitting at the bar, we made some friends that bought us a round of drinks. Good vibes at the Grill.  I would totally come back! This place was fun and had good food. Checks all the boxes.  What I tried: Chilaquiles con Huevos- This is one of my favorite dishes and I like to order it everywhere it's available so I can compare. These rank very high in my book, about on par with Everly. I'm pretty sure that chilaquiles are traditionally what you do with leftover tortillas. Like a true Millennial, I'll pay a premium for leftovers I didn't have to prepare myself. Yum!  Southern Grits and Eggs- Oh these were good. The grits were so creamy and I love an over easy egg. I think you can appropriately use the word unctuous to describe this dish. Highly recommend.  Happy brunching to you!"}
{"text":"I'm totally surprised I have been here a couple of times and I haven't made a review. 5 Stars ALL THE WAY: food, drinks, and service.  Food I've only been here for brunch-- love brunch. I've ordered the Texas Two Step and the Chicken-Fried Chicken Biscuit. I've tried bites of their Banana Pecan French toast and their Chorizo and Egg Street Tacos. Every bit I've taken at El Dorado has been a memorable one. I can't stop thinking about this food. I'll start with the Texas Two Step. This was the first dish I ever ordered from here. Every time I come to a place and they have Texas on the menu, I have to try it out; it's because I'm Texan. The biscuit is honestly TEXAS sized. It is house made and the sausage patty was my favorite part of the dish in addition to the gravy. Each bite melted in my mouth. The savory gravy that is made with buttermilk and onions....oh my gosh. excellent. The chicken-fried chicken biscuit--- great. Honestly I love biscuits gravy.   TIP: ask for extra gravy....it's worth it.  Drinks I heard their bloody mary's are good here. I've had their Tito-Driver. Again, this Texan likes Texas things-- Tito's is from Austin. It was STRONG. Their coffee is piping hot and they are good about refills.  Service EXCELLENT. Even though they are busy, the service is great. Refills on drinks are fast and they are able to split bills easily.   If you haven't been here yet for brunch -- you have to go. Good for a small group of friends (definitely no more than 5 or 6). They prefer 2-5 people in the parties because their seating is limited. It's packed on the weekends. I will definitely have to come by for lunch/dinner some time. This is one of my favorite Food Fight restaurants."}
{"text":"We just went to a tequila tasting and brunch. Absolutely amazing. Three huge servings of brunch type food with 3 wonderful matching cocktails + 3 shots of top end tequila. Although the distributor who did the educational part was absolutely delightful and fun, the best part was how well the cocktails were matched with the food. Drinks that I didn't like before the food arrived were excellent once paired with the food. We had stuffed French toast with tequila sauce, cream and fruit, chorizo hash with eggs, and a corn tortilla bake with skirt steak. Everything was garnished beautifully and huge servings. I've been to El Dorado Grill numerous times and I've always been pleased. They outdid themselves today"}
{"text":"Oh gosh. Cinnamon-crusted french toast. That's mostly all you need to know.  Went for brunch and was pleased to find huge, tasty meals for less than $10 a person. I got the banana pecan french toast and was delighted to find that 'cinnamon crust' didn't mean some spices had been sprinkled on top of the loaf, but rather that the whole slice of bread had been dredged in a crunchy cinnamon coating. Delicious and a big enough portion to make into 2.5 or 3 meals if you get a side (I did - the house potatoes, which were well-seasoned and thinly sliced, but could have used a bit more crispiness for my liking).   A friend got the pinapple-mango french toast and that looked amazing as well. She did a smart thing and ordered the fruit on the side, keeping the bread from turning into mush and making it perfect for leftovers. The other three people we dined with got egg-based things, and they all seemed happy. I'm not an egg person, so I didn't pay too close attention to what they ordered - Eldorado eggs, an omelette, and a scramble I believe.   Service was fast and friendly, and at 10 am on a Saturday the place was pleasantly quiet and uncrowded - Saturday brunch is a newer addition to their hours from what I understand, but I imagine it won't stay half-empty for long. Going for brunch has definitely convinced me I need to check out lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"It was good. The service was okay but they were pretty busy that night so it really wasn't their fault. Chips and salsa were excellent. My burrito was pretty good. Everything has a sweet taste which is very unique and I liked it. Overall, a good restaurant."}
{"text":"The El Dorado is a Food Fight, Inc restaurant. It is one of the better Food Fight Restaurants. I'd call the fare - Tex Mex comfort food for the Midwest. Perhaps Lake Wobegon Tex Mex.   The specialty drinks are the wowza of the menu. The hand crafted libations will find a way to wet your whistle.  I had a ginger honey margarita on the rocks. Pretty darned tasty, as was the Bullet Smash.   I also had the Big Tex... A sampling of their BBQ. It was as good as any other BBQ in town. The beef briquette and pulled pork were fine. The pork ribs were OK.   I thought the star of anything I sampled was the empanadas - these were fantastic. Little pasties filled with briquette and I think mushrooms - three to an order - but very rich and savory.   Companions ordered the Chef's Tacos - a night special, chipotle tenderloin, and the fillet of catfish. The tacos were the standout of these bunch. One pulled pork and one veggie.   We split the two dessert differing a 4-ways. One order of flan and one order of pecan pie. Both were tasty with the edge going to the pecan pie."}
{"text":"Always one of my two favorite places for brunch in Madison! I have never been a huge fan of their dinner menu, but to be fair, I have not given it much of a chance--I'd estimate I've been for brunch 30+ times but only three times for dinner.  Killer Bloody Marias are the order of the day--Pepper infused Tequila mixed with the house-made bloody mix are amazing.   As for the brunch menu--no misses. Breakfast burrito, Roasted Chicken Burrito (incomparable), and the Eldorao Eggs are all favorites. My wife loves the Yippy Hash if you're feeling veggie.  Got a group? Split a giant blue corn pancake and make sure to get the chile syrup to top it off.  Have another bloody maria (my wife prefers a Smoking Gun) and ease your way into an afternoon nap with a full belly and pleasant buzz..."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. They took reservations which was really nice. The bloody murder (Bloody Mary with chile vodka) was amazing. Everyone loved the brunch foods."}
{"text":"Solid food. Had a strange bud delicious spicy chocolate crime brûlée once. Fun tequila drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in at El Dorado Grill for brunch this morning and we were not disappointed! We did not have a reservation so we waited about 20 minutes at the bar. I got a mango flavored mimosa that was pretty big and only $5.75. The brunch menu is big and includes a few lunch options as well. The gluten free options are labeled - there were about three of them but they could probably modify some of the other options if you asked. I had the \"Migas\" which was scrambled eggs with peppers, tortilla strips, lots of cheese, onions, and corn. The \"Migas\" came with 2 slices of bacon, breakfast potatoes, and refried beans. My boyfriend had the \"Gringo burrito\" and said it was great as well. The service was a little slow but everyone was very friendly. There is a pretty big parking lot for customers but it fills up quickly, you can also park on the street. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved that we could sit outdoors in a heated space and be comfortable in November. The Macha Pork Burrito was amazing: a delicious medley of flavors in my mouth. Be sure to take advantage of the free chips and salsa deal for yelpers."}
{"text":"we came in late-ish one rainy evening for dinner, after a friend highly recommended it. the place was virtually empty but it still took ages for us to be seated.   i ordered the grilled lobster, shrimp and crab enchiladas and was fairly disappointed by the lack of flavor. i don't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but he had a similar issue with his dish. the service was extra slow during our whole meal, and the waitress didn't even bother to refill my water.   for the price, you should definitely get better food and service."}
{"text":"If you like tacos and tequila look no further. They awesome menu and great brunch. It's pretty popular so it tends to be very busy."}
{"text":"Duchess!! \"enough said\"... and that their brunch is pretty incredible too...!!"}
{"text":"Bloody Marys are fully loaded with your daily dose of veggies and only $6.50. What a great appetizer. Their brunch is great for the following reason: blueberry and bacon pancakes. You're welcome. 3/4\" thick, fluffy and peppered with blueberries and bacon-y goodness and topped with a pat of butter, you cannot find a better pancake in this town. The pancakes were also so big I could only eat one. I had to get the other one boxed up. The bf had the migas which were tasty as well. The menu had a lot of solid choices, so it was hard to make a decision. The point is, you can't go wrong with anything you order on Eldorado's brunch menu. I think I'm going to try the Mango Pineapple French Toast next time."}
{"text":"Really good tex mex! Best in madison"}
{"text":"Ate here for brunch on a Saturday morning and arrived right as the restaurant opened. Despite the fact that we were one of the first seated and ordering almost immediately, it took almost an hour for the food to arrive. I would not have held the wait against the restaurant if the food had been fantastic, but it was less than mediocre. The Texas Two Step was completely bland and the sausage patty was as hard and as tasty as a roof shingle. The biscuit was more like a giant baguette, and the gravy was watery. I was so annoyed by my breakfast that I tried to eat some of my husband's - he ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken Biscuit - another let down. Again, eating this restaurant's biscuits is like eating a giant, flavorless baguette. The house potatoes are not good. I am beyond baffled by the rave reviews of this restaurant. I can honestly say this is one of the worst breakfasts I've ever paid for."}
{"text":"Update: Good food - not great, but not bad either.  If I was rating on service and ambiance I'd give them a solid four stars.  It's always a packed house, no matter what day of the week, and the service is consistently quick and helpful.  They offer a cozy and inviting space, so if you're looking for tex-mex and want a more comfortable experience than the average Mexican restaurant it's a great option.  Dishes are well-prepared, well-presented and mild on flavor."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I said I came to Eldorado for the food alone (even though I do). What I do come for are the drinks. Margaritas of all kinds, fantastic bloody marys (I could make a brunch out of those alone) and a solid Paloma from time to time.   That being said, they have something for everyone on their menu. Burritos (for brunch, lunch, and dinner) great fried chicken, and those tasty little potato pancakes for days when I'd rather leave extra room for another brunch margarita.   It gets busy at brunch time and at happy hour so make sure to arrive early to get your name on the list."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Madison! Fantastic margaritas and drink specials. Brunch is also fantastic."}
{"text":"One of the better brunch spots in town, though I don't recommend trying for brunch without a reservation or you'll wait an hour or two in their hallway or hovering 2-deep at their bar.     Food has been good to very good every time. Nothing has ever arrived to me under or over cooked, ill prepared or lacking in flavor.       However I have more than once experienced trouble with their waitstaff being somewhat less than competent. Most recently, our waitress absolutely could not figure out how to split our (group of 5) checks, even though we told her right away before we ordered. Her attempts to fix it were so completely wrong and off base that it was obvious she did not have anything written down from what we ordered or asked or told her. She got a manager to fix it, and it was still very wrong. Not a little, a lot. Like, things no one ordered wrong. It was so horrible that after about 30 minutes of being really nice to her about it, we just told her to have her manager put everything back together, and we would sort it out. Stuff like that.      Food is yummy, even though it's a Food Fight restaurant, I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I go here Quite Often for brunch.  Here is my take: 4 Stars. The Brunch Menu is very good. They Offer A Couple Variations of Eggs Benedict With A Southern Twist that I have found to be very good.  If You're in the mood for a Giant Breakfast Burrito go with the Gringo Burrito.  It's filled With Ham, Cheese, and Eggs.  Delicious.  The Breakfast Potatoes that come with each dish are to die for.  Highly recommend this place for Brunch."}
{"text":"Vastly overpriced for watered down, unauthentic Americanized \"Mexican\" food.  Based on the reviews, I was very excited to dine at Eldorado Grill. Man... what a huge let down.   Cons: Chips and Salsa - salsa was nothing but pureed tomatoes with paprika and chips didn't taste fresh.  Too pricey - my assumption is because it's located on Willy St. where nearly every restaurant located in the area is a bit more costly Selection - small menu. how can you be a Mexican joint and NOT offer tacos???! They only taco dish they had were fish tacos. This makes no sense to me at all.  Portion sizes - small for what you're paying My order - ordered the chicken and mushroom burito. I tasted not one mushroom and it was loaded with too much spice. Rice and black beans that came with it wasn't good. The grain of rice they used didn't go well with the meal and the beans were overcooked   Pros Service - was fantastic. Our server didn't miss a beat handling our demanding party of 15. Thank you! Also, hostess was very friendly and kept us up to the minutes with updates on our table being ready.  That being said, I would not be returning. Food just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Our party of what was supposed to be 5 didn't make a reservation. When our party got there we were told by the hostess that we would not be seated that day, as they were too full. Frankly, I've been in the service industry for a long time and there are ways to tell a customer \"no\" without being abrasive. Give me an option to wait, or sit at the bar! Just a flat out \"no\" is not okay.  We did end up only having 4 people to our party and found 4 seats together at the bar...on our own. It even took us a second to be acknowledged by the bar staff. But when we finally did, our mimosas were always full and the food was amazing.   We learned our lesson to make reservations, but I will make sure I have someone else speak to the hostess when we arrive, as I didn't feel welcomed."}
{"text":"After dining here for brunch, dinner, restaurant week and coming for a Yelp Elite event, I can confidently say that Eldorado is reliably good. I definitely recommend it for a meal with a small group.   The atmosphere is fun and the bar is great. There's always a lot of people there talking to the friendly bartenders. A perfect spot for Thursday evening drinks. Or just come before you're hungry and get drinks until your table is ready, because there likely is a wait.   The details:  Brunch: large menu with a huge variety ranging from typical breakfast food to dishes with a TexMex spin. They take reservations which is impressive! Love the brunch margarita and the Eldorado Eggs.  Dinner: also a lot of options. Especially exciting for people who like big, carnivorous meals.   Restaurant Week: one of the better ones I've been to in Madison. The portions weren't too skimpy and everything was tasty. The horchata milkshake was wonderful.   Why just 4 stars? I'm still waiting to try that dish that truly blows my mind."}
{"text":"After a cold Corona at our hotel bar upon finishing the Ironman 70.3 triathlon Sunday, my amazing fiancé and I went here. We had already gone to one of their sister restaurants, Cento, on Saturday night before the race, we wanted to visit another one of their restaurants.   We were not disappointed. Excellent service by bartender Adria & a great description of why they have a huge barrel of Casa Noble tequila hanging from the ceiling. We each had a killer marg:  mine was a jalapeño infused Casa Noble  tequila.  Chips, salsa, guacamole rounded out our visit.  Another reason to love Madison: Eldorado!"}
{"text":"Arrived early to Eldorado Grill on a cold, rainy Monday evening to take advantage of happy hour. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and the wait staff, and found the place mostly empty and quiet around 5 p.m. We took seats at the bar. My Eldorado classic margarita was just the way I like it -- not too sweet, lots of salt on the rim, clean bright lime flavor and made with Patron tequila. My companion enjoyed the several Shiner beer varieties, served very cold. The food was superb. I was allowed to make several substitutions to my entree, which was no problem at all. The bartender serving us was attentive, accurate and timely with our orders, relaxed and personable. The guacamole is very good, and my blackened shrimp was delicious."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was the best I have had. We all sampled from each other and everything was incredible! I thought the juevos rancheros was the best, but the pancakes and French toast was also great! I don't know how they make relatively simple breakfast foods so great, but they do. Get there early or make reservations."}
{"text":"Everything the reviews say is true - we showed up at 11:30am on a Sunday and were told we could be seated AROUND 1:30 PM.  What?!? Luckily there were seats at the bar - I think I actually sat across from one of the previous reviewers which is weird... but anyway! Bartenders did do great serving us, I didn't get alcohol but we noted that the alcohol seemed to be the major selling point for brunch.  Margs, bloodies and mimosas were leaving the bar nonstop, and looked delicious.  Lots of variations on mimosas like pomegranate, and they had rhubarb (?) margaritas.  Large plate of food, good value for the money.  I had the Chicken Fried Chicken and Biscuit which was very good, not great.  The food was warm and not hot which is my main complaint about it.  Only dark meat chicken was used which wasn't disclosed and it was a little greasy.  Flavors were all good.  A friend had a sad looking omelette special, and another friend had a pork burrito that looked great. Everything was served with a Spanish seasoned potato which could have been crispier but was a nice change.  A friend commented she really wanted crispy hashbrowns, which were not an option. If you want a tipsy brunch this is definitely a good option, but make a reservation.  The menu was interesting and I'd go back."}
{"text":"Bless me Food Fight, for I have sinned, it has been 15 years since my last visit to Eldorado Grill...  Years ago, while living on the east side, the Eldorado Grill was one of my favorite haunts.  But after a couple of less than satisfactory experiences left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), I stayed away from this Food Fight stalwart for over a decade.  That changed this week.  After a scheduling snafu precluded our group from our first dining option, someone suggested Eldorado instead.  And after a very satisfying Restaurant Week experience, I am definitely a fan again.  The kitchen turned out some extremely satisfying food that has me itching to make a return visit.  While I am more of a wine guy, the extensive cocktail menu at Eldorado really caught my eye.  After discussing several options with the server, I decided on the Smoking Gun, an intoxicating concoction of infused chili tequila, Scorpion mescal, fresh lime and a splash of bitters.  The smoky finish of the mescal paired up well with both my appetizer and main course.  While the bland tomato salsa was nothing to write home about, the fresh guacamole ($5.95 for a MASSIVE serving) was a hit.  The ingredients were well balanced and it had the chunky texture I prefer.  The kitchen hit it out of the park in the appetizer course.  The Green Chile Pork Stew was the essence of Tex-Mex cuisine in a cup.  The slow cooked pork was melt-in-your mouth tender and the cumin sour cream gave the dish a pungent, earthy finish.  The roasted green chilies added satisfying warmth.  I wish the tortilla strips were a little thicker to provide the dish with some textures.  The thin strips quickly lost their crunch when mixed into the stew.  The exceedingly tender, thinly sliced brisket was another solid Tex-Mex offering.  Slathered in a slightly spicy sauce with a kiss of smoke, I found the dish to be extremely satisfying.  The serving size was on the large side, which is exceedingly rare during Restaurant Week.  The sides were hit and miss.  The smoky chipotle dressing gave the potato salad a perfect hit of spicy heat.  The savory green chili pinto beans were perfectly prepared, but could have used some green chilies.  I was less of a fan of the under-dressed slaw - it would have benefited from some of that wonderful chipotle dressing.  I also thought the cold cornmeal pancake was an odd choice - give me a slab of cornbread next time.    Dessert was a bust for me - I ordered the Mexican Coke float (homemade mole ice cream and Mexican Coke topped with whipped cream).  What was missing from that description was the fact there were peanuts in the ice cream and I have a severe peanut allergy (which ultimately led to a date with my epi pen later that evening).  Our server never checked back with our table after serving the desserts, so I was not able to get a different dessert.  That was the bad news.    The good news is how the restaurant responded when I contacted them the following day.  I received a phone call from Taylor Anderson, the restaurant general manager and I shared my concerns about unexpectedly finding peanuts in my dessert.  Taylor immediately volunteered to comp my meal.  More importantly, he modified the Restaurant Week menu to indicate the inclusion of peanuts in the dessert, which won my respect.  Things don't always go right, I totally get that.  The response to said adversity by Eldorado Grill won my respect and made me a fan.  It definitely will not be another fifteen years before I make my next visit."}
{"text":"Eldorado margaritas do not disappoint! One of the best in the city. The food unfortunately time and time is \"good not great\". Giving this place 3 stars for this inexpensive happy hour deals and 5 star margaritas!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience and good food/drinks. Service is fast. I have been there twice and both times the experience was good. Tried their vegan chile this time, which was amazing. Will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Reviewing a second trip to Eldorado, this time for dinner.   We made reservations for a weeknight, given that this place always seems to have a wait. Glad we did. Our table was already set up with waters and everything. Service was good throughout the evening. The teamwork showed.   Apps: The server asked if we wanted to start with chips and salsa. I knew based on reading ahead of time there was a charge, but they are cheap, so we said yes. The chips were light and crispy. The salsa was good. Not hot at all, but very flavorful. We also tried the Texas Torpedos (jalapenos stuffed with cheese, shrimp, wrapped in bacon and grilled). They were delicious! They were spicy, but didn't kill our more mild-loving friend.  I had perused the Yelp reviews to help with decisions, as the menu is focused, but large. I'm glad I looked ahead of time, so I knew how Eldorado does enchiladas. I actually was looking forward to this version, as it's not the typical, heavy \"smothered in cheese\" Mexican version (more like stacked taquitos with sauces on the bottom of the plate). Our table had the smoked chicken enchiladas, pork adobo and pork burrito. The corn tortillas had a perfect texture and were grilled til crisp. Flavors were all there and I didn't feel stuffed afterwards. I tried the pork adobo and it was awesome. Deep red sauce, tender pork and fresh avocado. Super flavorful and a large serving. I didn't try the pork burrito, but my tablemate said it was really good. Crisp on the outside of the flour tortilla, like maybe it was finished in the oven?   We each had a different cocktail (sangria, blazing saddle, honey ginger margarita). The honey ginger margarita was the real winner. I'd definitely order it next time. The blazing saddle was a bit too spicy for us to really enjoy as a full drink. Sangria was okay.    Overall, everything was really good. If you are looking for huge spicy flavors, you might be a little disappointed in the fare. The flavors were more subtle, but didn't dissapoint. After writing the review, I'm hungry again for those enchiladas and that honey ginger margarita."}
{"text":"Went to Eldorado for a date night. The bartender was wonderful and the food was delicious! We can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Love love love this place and the smoked chicken enchiladas... My fiancé literally said \"if we were at home, I'd be licking the plate right now\""}
{"text":"I've been here three times and the food has always been incredible!  This time, we came on short notice for dinner, right at the peak time.  We opted to eat at the bar and the bar tender was amazing!  Trying to single-handily serve the bar AND all drink orders for the rest of the restaurant....really not a fair thing to ask of a single bar tender in such a hot restaurant.  That said, he did an admirable job.  The kitchen was backed up a bit - they warned us ahead of time.  We had to wait a little for the food but, he comped us a beer and chips....cool!  hint:  call ahead for a reservation or, eat at the bar - full service menu there!"}
{"text":"Brunch = A+ Dinner = A Drinks = A+ Service = C  Brunch: reasonably priced (all dishes under $10), lots of vegetarian options, fun atmosphere, great food. I brunch with a group of friends at eldorado about twice a month. I always get the killer bloody murder and the chicken fried chicken biscuit. GET THE CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN BISCUIT with an extra side of gravy. You will not regret it. It is completely worth the extra two hours you'll need to spend on the treadmill.   Dinner: certainly pricier than your average tex-mex spot, but just make smart decisions when you're ordering (i.e. if you think $12 is too much for a quesadilla, then don't order the quesadilla). Recently had the chicken fried chicken dinner plate, since I already knew I loved it. Dining partner had the brisket, which was also amazing.  We started with the green chili pork nachos and both absolutely loved them.    Drinks: margaritas are made from scratch (the bartender himself juices all the limes), and they are only available on the rocks or straight up. The brunch margaritas are a little fruitier than the regular margaritas but are very good.  I personally always go with the bloody.  Service: total hit or miss. Half of the time the service is borderline nonexistent. It's annoying, but we usually feel that the food and drinks are worth the wait. Plus, if you kindly inform them that you are waiting on service/haven't yet seen your server, they are usually pretty nice about it and try to make up for it. If you have a small enough group of people, sitting at the bar is the best bet for fast and attentive service.   Always make reservations, even for brunch."}
{"text":"Make sure you wear your best hipster get up if you want a good seat here on a busy night. I came here after work on a Friday and they made us wait 20 more minutes than we were told then we were sat on the patio. It was cold that day so the metal chairs they sat us on we're less than comfy. I'll take bar food someplace else over this pretentious upscale wannabe restaurant any day."}
{"text":"I took my wife and kids here for brunch. Simply put, this is the best brunch we have had in Madison in our 11+years together. The foodwas fresh, from the cilantro sauce on the Eldorado eggs to the salsa which weer put on our potatoes. My wife's chicken enchilada was smashing and she could nothave enjoyed them more. The kids had the bitten pancakes which were perfectly grilled, fluffy, and not too sweet.   We liked the atmosphere overall, but the restaurant could use a little more color. Even though it was a bit slow because of mother's day, it was not a serious issue for the overall enjoyment of the experience. We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch as part of a birthday party for a dear friend.   It's my second time eating here, so I feel fairly comfortable with my review.   The food is good and decently priced. I recommend trying the vegan burrito. The flavors were spot on, and not too spicy for me to handle. I do wish the descriptions of what each dish contains would be a little less vague. Telling me a dish comes with a named salsa, but never actually telling me what is in it is unhelpful at best.   The service is friendly and fast, but the severs I've had haven't been terribly knowledgeable about the menu. This is always something that'll knock down a star, just because of food allergies.   Overall, it's worth checking out. Do yourself a favor though, order a tequila sunrise. Divine."}
{"text":"Read in Madison Magazine that this was one of the best brunches in town. It definitely didn't disappoint!  Our small group enjoyed every item we ordered - including the great bloodied and screwdrivers. The blueberry and bacon pancake was a hit as was the ElDorado Benedict with smoked salmon and potato pancakes. Fun place for a casual, social gathering and the menu is loaded with things that sound delicious. Definitely recommend this place for brunch and will be heading back soon to see what other deliciousness we can find!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best margaritas I've ever had - freshly squeezed and fantastic tequila. Food is always tasty, but it's a bit on the pricey side. I would highly recommend checking them out during Restaurant week. Definitely a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"After visiting El Dorado twice (once for dinner, once for brunch), I have deemed it to be a solid 3 experience on average.   First of all, I realize that charging for chips and salsa is common around these parts, but really? Maybe if they actually had decent salsa and not just flavorless red liquid. The guacamole is great and even the pico de gallo is flavorful, but they fail miserably in the salsa category. I like that they offer a variety of cocktails, not just margaritas. And Tito's vodka is a nice touch!   For dinner, I tried the fish tacos, for which I have very high standards. They missed the mark in that the pieces of fish were HUGE and not very well seasoned. They also needed an accompanying sauce of some sort. Happy hour specials were not bad, half price appetizers and $5 house margaritas.   For brunch, I tried the huevos rancheros, which were pretty good. My brunch mate ordered the chilaquiles and liked them. Props to El Dorado for offering some great Tex Mex brunch options. I just wish the mimosas weren't $5.50!!!!   Unfortunately, Madison's Tex Mex offerings are lacking in quality, but after living in Austin for so long, my standards are quite high."}
{"text":"Very pleased with Sunday brunch. Great live music and well developed, reasonably priced menu. I got the el dorado eggs, which were excellent. Next time I will try the bloody Mary with chili infused vodka ."}
{"text":"I went to brunch here this past Sunday with a group of 20. We of course made reservations well ahead of time and miraculously ended up with exactly 20 people attending.  The first not so great moment was when we were told that 14 of us would be at one large row of tables and 6 of us would be on the complete opposite side of the restaurant. My thoughts are, why would they take the reservation if they didn't have a place for 20 of us to sit together? Also, why would they think we were all going to brunch together if we were fine with sitting on the opposite side of the restaurant?  It was pretty disappointing. A small group ended up leaving and a table next to the long row of tables opened up. However, we still didn't have enough room for everyone, so three people ate on chairs at the end of the row because we were told they couldn't put a table there for fire code reasons. Why is there a bench there to sit if you can't put a table there?  They were completely unorganized and despite our extreme efforts to be incredibly kind and empathetic to the waitresses, one of them was incredibly rude and snapped every time she was asked a question. So, the service was already very sub par.  The food, meh. Not much better. I ordered two mimosas right off the bat (I thought I may not get another chance to order a beverage) - which I went up to the bar to do because no waitress came by our table during the first 10 minutes after we arrived. Those were good. The guy at the bar filled them almost to the top with champagne and added a splash of orange juice. They were also only about 5 dollars I think, which isn't that insanely overpriced. For brunch, I ordered the French Toast with a side of bacon. For some reason, they thought I meant I wanted ONE PIECE of French Toast.  This is totally lost on me. Would I really order one piece of french toast and a side of bacon and that's it? I even pointed at my menu and said \"THE\" french toast. So, that was weird. After awhile our food came and everyone was pretty much agreed that it was not very good. A friend of mine ordered pancakes and said they were incredibly chewy. The French Toast was fine, but nothing special.  At the end of the meal, it took an incredibly long time to get our checks. They messed a bunch of people's up and we waited almost a half hour for ours once they started giving them out.  All in all, it was somewhat ridiculous and there was really no redeeming qualities to the place at all. We live a block away and I doubt I'll ever be dining here again."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price!  Bloody Marys are delicious!  Watch out!  They're spicy! Our server had a bit of an attitude but that probably won't keep us from coming back."}
{"text":"Most tragic event ever - for an amazing restaurant experience, let's keep this in perspective people! But I showed up to my most amazing brunch ever to discover a different menu and the incredible quesadillas off the brunch menu. Heartbreaking. The nice server promised to ask if the could accommodate my need for the best brunch food ever, but really, without it on the menu, so many people are now denied this amazingness. The drinks are amazing, the ambiance is great, the food is delicious, if a bit pricey. But I am from New Mexico and incredibly and appropriately picky about my Mexican food, so this was so sad for me. I hope this changes and I can return weekly, per usual, and return this to the 8 stars it so deserves with the right menu item! Love this place, love the brunch quesadillas even more.  In conclusion: please return the quesadillas to the brunch menu.  Update: they were not able to accommodate my quesadilla needs. Appreciate the efforts. Crying in my delicious salty dog."}
{"text":"How about a place that focuses on Tex/Mex, Bar B Q, southern comfort food, artisinal cocktails,house ground spices?  This place can't don any of it!!  They cannot even get the dirty dishes off the table. I know that small town foodies don't have much to choose from, but hey, Madtown--thought you had it goining on.  Place is way way too ambitious and fails everywhere for trying to be something it's not.  The worst"}
{"text":"I am happily updating my last review! The manager of the restaurant sent me a $50 gift certificate and a personal invite to come back to try different menu items. Boy did I take up that offer. My boyfriend and I ordered:   1. Fried Avacado Street Tacos (app) 2. Spinach Mushroom Enchiladas (main) 3. Pan-Seared Tenderloin with Chipotle Blue Butter (main) 4. Tequilla Mango w/ Ice Creame (dessert)  The street tacos were my favorite. They were quite simple but beautifully done. The avacado was the hero of the dish with a lightly fried batter. It was topped with a cream sauce and a side of salsa. Both flavors added a nice kick to the dish.   I had a really hard time deciding what I wanted for my main. There were two types of vegetrarian enchilladas. When I asked the server for help she recommended the spinach mushroom and said there was lots of cheese (which she was excited about). I am not a huge fan of gooey cheese so she said she'd make a note to the cooks. The enchilladas came out with the perfect amount of filling and just the right amount of cheese.   Although we didn't have room, we opted for dessert. The mangos were quite tasty. However, both my boyfriend and I said we enjoyed the ice creame on its own.   While the food was really, really good, I'd like to point out that our service was even better. Our waitress was incredibly nice, personable, and well versed about the menu. She made our evening fun and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I loved the brunch here! Went on a weekend and it was not too busy. I ordered the Yippie Hash, which was delicious. The veggies were incredibly fresh and the dish was very flavorful. Our service was great. I don't live in Madison, but look forward to coming back and having this dish again!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here partially because of the recent ROTD featuring Eldorado, and partially because I needed a margarita and tacos in my life anyway. I decided to check out the happy hour and it did not disappoint!   I ended up having a (very stiff) margarita, the street tacos, and the bacon-wrapped and cheese/shrimp stuffed jalapenos (ridiculously good. seriously). Everything was delicious and came out to less than $15!   Everyone in our group was super happy with their food and drinks and I think we will all be going back soon for more. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I like the Eldorado great brunch loved the smoked salmon, but would be nice if they had a choice of bagel beside just a plain bagel.  Kids meals are very well put together too, very tasty a bit more pricey the usual but well worth the buck or two more.  The room in a converted loft building is nice and roomy.  The entrance is in the rear, the waitress we had was a bit weird."}
{"text":"Solid TexMex, southwestern and bbq dishes on the menu. The Texas brisket was good but the flavor was overwhelmed by the bbq sauce. True smoked meats don't need sauce and it was falling apart since it appears to have been in moist heat.  The fish tacos and chicken fried chicken were more successful. The corn bread pancake was a nice twist. The service was friendly and quick. Prices were decent."}
{"text":"This place. I have been trying to go here forever but it's also an hour plus wait. Well now I know it was worth the wait. Before I get to the food I have to pay respect to the Bloody Mary. Oh. My. God. So spicy, so perfect. Then followed by the food. You'd have thought I died and went to heaven.   The Texas two step was the meal to order at our table. Beautiful biscuits with a gravy comparable to the nectar of the gods. Poached egg and two pieces of the best bacon I have ever had. We also cashed in on their free chips and salsa deal through yelp and even that was to die for.   If you are in Madison and need brunch. Stop over on Willy Street and look no further. I plan spending far more brunches holed up eating my weight in biscuits and drowning the thoughts of Monday away with their bloodies."}
{"text":"Great menu selection. Attentive service from Heather K. Water glass was always full. A bit slow to get our food. Well worth the wait. Great flavor from the tenderloin. Lightly spiced seafood enchiladas were awesome."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and bartenders very friendly. Not put off by my ordering happy hour food. Ancho pecan pie was awesome!  Crust on pie was yummy flaky. Music was fitting--overplayed old country."}
{"text":"The service at the bar was great along with the house margarita. The guacamole chalupas were outstanding! Next time in Madison, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"As a purveyor of tex mex, this place is really good for Mexican. A little less spicy than I'm used to or than I would have it, but defo the spot to get that itch scratched while on tour. I had the mushroom spinach enchiladas and I won!"}
{"text":"Id like to start by saying that I have been eating at El Dorado Grille for years and years and I have never had a bad meal or a bad drink here! I am especially fond of the chipoltle blue cheese butter steak and the chicken fried chicken. The mixed drinks and margaritas are wonderful too.  I very much enjoy their collard greens, mashed potatoes and corn bread as well. There is usually a wait so be sure to make a reservation if you plan on going during a busy time. The atmosphere is lively (though a bit loud id you're sensitive to that kind of thing) so dont think you're going to have a quite meal here.  The bar is stocked with a fantastic array of tequilas and the wait staff has always been courteous.  I have and will continue to recommend El Dorado Grille to anyone looking for upgraded tex-mex fare."}
{"text":"The pluses are that the artisanal margaritas are wonderful. The food tasted very good. Our waitress was  lovely and service recovery oriented.  Which of course means that service recovery was needed.  The appetizer of street tacos were cold when they came out. Not just the garnish-the shell and meat too. Those artisanal cocktails should be treated as such and the bartender was using the same mixer top across multiple different drinks. If I want my blazing saddles to have a hint of smoking gun, I'll ask for it.  The chili was very decent. The Texas torpedoes were awesome. The enchiladas were disappointing.  The venue is small. Given its popularity they could definitely open a second location and do well. And despite the minor errors, we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for brunch. Tons of veggie options for us veg-friendly folk.  One of the biggest frustrations is the lack of variety in the menu. I've been a couple times, but it seems like every item includes: a corn tortilla, some veggies, and potatoes in one form or another. Even lousy Mexican restaurants find a way to mix it up with some sauces or variations in cooking style.  Drinks are great! They have chile-infused vodka that they make a lot of their drinks with. They also have a couple different versions of Bloody Mary's (one with tequila!). I would recommend trying one of the crazy ones if you go.  Otherwise, the food is pretty average. Yippie Hash is one of my personal favorites (also pretty healthy)."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious! The staff was really friendly, but service was a bit spotty - a couple of requests were missed. I'm guessing it's because the Saturday brunch crush was just beginning and it got packed pretty quickly. For sure a great place to stop for tasty food when you're in Madison!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner on a recent visit to Madison.  Love the decor , menu options and food.  The place was almost full when we arrived at 6 on a Tuesday evening, so we were seated in the bar.  A little noisy but the  service and timing of our food were excellent.  The Eldorado Margarita is the best!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a Happy Hour specific review.   At Eldorado with a group of about 10, including Madtown Review Crew members, we worked through the appetizer menu and quite a number of margaritas.  Here's a rundown of the appetizers in order of general acclaim: A to A+   Texas Torpedos:  Great combination of flavors A             Maria's Handmade tamales:  moist, tender, good balance of masa vs. fillings A to B+   Veggie & Goat Cheese Empanadas:  Delightful texture; interesting flavor A to B     Southwestern Fish Cakes:  \"Spicy\";  \"too fishy\"; a far cry from crabcakes! 2B's 1A   BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders \"too much smoke\" \"very sweet BBQ flavor\"  And the margaritas? B+           world famous Eldorado Margarita (consistent score among raters) A+ to B-  Blazing Saddle -  from odd/spicy to rich/mellow blend of flavors C              mango margarita \"was better before\"  Overall?    AGREAT  happy hour - - those appetizers are distinctive and interesting - - real variety in the product and presentation - - and at happy hour prices you cannot go wrong.   The margies are good value at $5,  well made, and very satisfying.   This is a top-of-the line happy hour spot."}
{"text":"yummerschnaks this place is good.  Owned by the guy who owns half a dozen other restaurants in Madison, he rarely fails to disappoint and the El Dorado is no exception.  Located in a cool old-brick building on Willy st., the El Dorado offers a great brunch selection.  I've never been there for lunch, so my review, while limited, will tell you just how good the brunch is.  In the several times that I've been there, I've usually had the scrambled eggs with chorizo sausage cooked-in, along with sides and such.  Absurdly good.  The other breakfast options I tried were all quite impressive as well, and they give you enough food that no one goes home hungry.  Service was good; waitresses have been prompt at getting refills and checking up on everyone, and they let you have enough time to schmooze with your companions as well.    Overall, the El Dorado provides a nice relaxing environment to have a casual Sunday brunch in a great neighborhood.  It's a little nicer of a place and the prices are a bit high, so keep that in mind depending on what type of place you like to frequent.  Tex-Mex done right."}
{"text":"Their chicken enchiladas are disgusting. The chicken tastes day or two old. The rice is too watery, mushy and needs more flavor."}
{"text":"Checked website and looked like a lot of good choices for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  Got there at about 1:00 p.m. and they were only serving breakfast and limited lunch items.  We did not stay.  Would recommend calling ahead to see what they are serving!!! Would be nice if they would update the website as well."}
{"text":"Seriously an hour and a half wait for brunch? I love the Eldorado and have always had good service, but I don't get the hiring of young kids to host. You need someone who can manage tables and keep things moving, the only reason I am saying this is because I worked many years in food service.  Also of note, wait staff hygiene is always a good thing. Last time I ate at the Eldorado the individual whom waited on us had the worse breath I have ever encountered. I didn't want to be rude and say something but when it knocks you over, that's a problem. It will be a while before I return. If you can't handle serving brunch, stick to lunch and dinner. Sad because typically the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"One of the numerous Food Fight Corp. dinner spots in town, it doesn't break the mold.  High on style, low on substance, Eldorado provides a pleasant atmosphere and upscale Tex-Mex fare.  Better burritos and fajitas can be found in town but not in a place as nice.    Also, stay away from the brunch.  Slow service and cold food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and drinks. My wife always gets the crab, shrimp and lobster enchiladas and on our last trip I got the spinach and mushroom enchiladas with mole. Both dishes were great and the margaritas paired well. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS. It has an elevated Tex-Mex feel.  Everything is beautifully plated which (in my experience) is somewhat rare for Tex-Mex cuisine. The menu has an extensive variety of options.  Everything I've tried has been great.    Onto the DRINKS!  They have an incredible, unique selection of drinks to choose from. These are some of the best drinks I've had anywhere in Madison.  The bartenders are talented drink mixers.   My ONE COMPLAINT about El Dorado...the bar is very busy during dinner on a weekend.  Every seat is taken and the standing room around the bar can be very crowded.  No problem...I can handle a crowd.  The problem is that there are only 2 bartenders behind the bar serving the people at the bar AND people seated at tables for dinner.  It takes FOREVER to get a drink...which is sad because they are so delicious. I came for dinner with a large group, and almost everyone gave up after the first drink because they were tired of waiting and trying to get service at the bar."}
{"text":"Top Shelf Tuesday! They pair a specialty taco and tequila. DD had the chicken taco and I had the shrimp....both were delicious!  They have house-made infused vodkas and tequilas. Perhaps they should call it 'Top Shelf Taco & Tequila Tuesday'! Casual atmosphere, reminded me of the 'Cheers' bar.  Mostly locals, which I believe is always a sign of a great place. We went early for dinner, which was smart....it was full within 20 minutes after our arrival. I can only praise what we ate, so here we go;  Honey ginger tequila, Dreamsicle tequila, home-made chips, salsa & guacamole, Empanadas, our tacos with our tequila shots, Herencia, & Burdeos Patron. Then we walked home, so the streets were safe!  They offer vegetarian & gluten free dishes. Their brunch on Saturdays & Sundays, 9 till 2, are said to be fabulous! On the Brunch menu, I counted 28 different breakfast dishes, (that's not counting all the different sides) & then there's the Brunch bar drinks (8) along with their non-alcohol offerings.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We recently had a problem getting a table on a Sunday. We had a group of 7 and I was disappointed with the hostess when she sent us off to another restaurant. HOWEVER, the manager read the review and immediately contacted me and apologized for this. I was impressed with her quick response. She talked to her staff and assured me this wouldn't happen to any other customers. In addition, she sent a card to my home with a gift certificate attached. This certificate would be enough to provide our whole family of 7! Obviously the management really does care about customer satisfaction! I look forward to enjoying a dinner with my family at the Eldorado restaurant! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Had after dinner drinks here for my birthday party.  Wasn't sure how they could handle the large (36 person) group on a Sat night, but they were awesome.  The margarita's here are great and it's fun to branch out into tequila tasting.  So not as pretentious as wine, and frankly quicker to the punch!  Sarah, the manager, was very accomodating and knowledgeable.  Wonderful place.  I've heard about their brunch, we'll have to go sometime!"}
