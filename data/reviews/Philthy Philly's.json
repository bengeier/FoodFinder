{"text":"I was in the area and was looking for a quick bite. Staff was extremely friendly. Got the original Philly cheesesteak and a philthy sized original poutine. Philly cheesesteak was tasty, but the philthy sauce was a bit sweet for my liking. The poutine was amazing!! Portions are big and can be shared."}
{"text":"What a find! Poutine and Philly Cheesesteak Sandwiches cooked to order with your choice of toppings. Reasonably priced.  Had the classic cheesesteak with Swiss and added cheese whiz,  grilled onions,  peppers etc.  Also had the triple cheese poutine,  the gravy was perfect! Fries are are fresh cut. Soooo tasty!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So good. The food is really amazing. Had the Souvlaki, was a really generous size for the small one. The fries are fresh and absolutely some of the best I've had. The poutine is next on my list to try.   The people are also very very nice. So genuinely helpful and friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This fast-food restaurant has cheese-steaks and fresh-cut fries, with a variety of gourmet toppings available.  I ordered a classic philly cheesesteak with regular fries, and the sandwich had a generous portion of steak, and the fries were perfectly crispy.  So it was reasonably priced for what you get.  There really hasn't been a good cheese-steak sandwich to be had in Scarborough since the Great Steak and Potato Company closed down at Scarborough Town Centre about *ten years ago*.  So was really happy to give this place a try, and was thrilled by the quality of the food.  Am hoping they do well, so I'll have a place in the neighborhood to go to get tasty cheeseteaks and fresh-cut fries!"}
{"text":"I went there at 11:30 am. I Had a regular poutine and more than half of the fries were undercooked. Hoping not to get sick."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm up in Newmarket I have to stop here for a Philly. The staff has always been friendly and quick. Best Philly that I have found so far. You can chose what type of cheese and topping you want on it."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive about trying this after seeing the less than savoury sandwich that was posted shortly after this place appeared. My friend and I popped in on a whim. My expectations for this place was a bit of a roller coaster ride.   The staff is extremely friendly. Service was great. The lady that took our order managed to convince my skeptical friend that cheese whiz is the way to go for a Philly cheesesteak. Mmm...cheese whiz. Being light eaters, we opted to share a Philly Supreme and Original Poutine.   Our food looked pretty damn good and I was super excited. The taste, however, was a little lacking. I expect big beefy taste so I was a little disappointed. The Poutine was loaded with cheese and gravy but again, the taste was just okay.   Overall, the service was great and food was okay so I'd go back, albeit with steadier expectations."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience to say the least. It had the roller coaster effect imo. It started off well and then completely went off the rails and went downhill from there. I went around lunch time and the place was not busy. I ordered the 6\" chicken sub and poutine combo special. Total came to about $13. I added the Montery jack cheese and Southwest Chipotle with pickles on sub. The poutine i had the vegetarian gravy. Let's start off by saying that the first bite was really good, the sauce was great. However the second bite and afterwards I did bot enjoy the food. The poutine is ok, the gravy is salty and the fries are way too soft. It was a filling lunch but right after i felt bad for eating this and I went straight to the washroom since My stomach could not handle it anymore. It's too bad bc i want to like this place but I have to be honest this was bad imo...not recommended."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here. I haven't come back because of the prices, but recently I was on a \"stay-cation\" so I decided to have lunch out while home. So I decided to go back here.  Have to admit, the fries here are excellent- good gravy too. That made me happy.   However, the cheesesteak I had didn't. The sandwich was made with a. Crumble type of beef. It didn't resemble steak at all. It was bland and honestly I couldn't taste it. I could taste the bun, the onion, pickles, cheese but I had to double check to see if there was actually any steak on it.   The sandwich was served almost open face to me, a philly needs to be wrapped to hold everything in and sure enough the bun that got soggy way to fast started to have all the toppings drop out the sides and all over the table.   Honestly... the fries were that good that I gave this place a 3 - but for a steak sandwich.... i'm sure there are other places that would service you a better one."}
{"text":"I was craving a Montreal style poutine ever since I tried it in Montreal. So I ordered the Montreal style at Philthy Philly's. It comes topped with Montreal style smoked meat, mustard and topped with some pickles. I must say I did enjoy it, it did hit the spot. It was delicious, and it was very filling. Great value for your money. It had just the right amount of gravy and cheese curds. I will recommend this place for a good poutine, and also a good cheesesteak. If you want something \"filthy\" you should try this place. They are also available on UberEATS."}
{"text":"First impression really good. You will for sure get what you paid for. Onion rings was great! The girl at the counter super nice n friendly. If u are craving for sandwich this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I ordered Greek Poutine which was good. However, it took them 35 minutes to have my order handed to me. Late night clubbing at Smokes that is jammed pack delivers 4 times as fast.   Also, it literally is the philtiest kitchen in Pickering...no hairnets , I see people pick their ears and handle food..just  disgusting."}
{"text":"The food is great... Service friendly... The portions are insane! Seems a bit expensive but it is shareable food!"}
{"text":"Between two adults and two children we ordered the Phil meal: 6\" original Philly cheesesteak (chicken), Phil sized fries and 24 oz fountain drink for $9.99 and also ordered an 8\" original Philly cheesesteak (steak, different toppings) with regular size poutine. The size was definitely big enough to share.  Both the steak and chicken were really tender, buns were warm and soft, great selection of cheeses and sauces for the sandwiches. Also includes mushroom, onion, green peppers, banana peppers, jalapenos. The kids actually ate quite a bit of the sandwiches and liked the chunky fries.  Fries were good and I was glad the cheese was a bit melted and warm in the poutine.  Restaurant and washrooms were fairly clean, friendly staff, about 5 booths and seating for another 10."}
{"text":"Was shopping in the Stockyards Village, and a friend wanted to try this new place.  The other reviews so far are bang on - messy but it's for a good reason.  The large sandwich was very generous filled with steak, and the meat was very flavourful.  It's not cheap (~$14 for a 12 inch) but I believe you get what you pay for, and it was worth it.    We didn't top up our sandwiches with different sauces because for our first visit, we wanted to be able to really taste what we were getting.  The sandwiches were delicious without any extra sauces.  (One order was Philly Cheesesteak with provolone, peppers and onions;  the other was the Triple Cheese with onions and mushroom.)    We ate in;  while it was not busy when we ordered as it wasn't meal-time (~430pm), the tables could've been better cleaned.  And by the time we left, there were a lot more customers.  The Stockyards Village is still going through some growing pains, and never too busy, but I hope this new place is successful.  More importantly, I hope that their servings remain as generous as this first experience when we visit next time."}
{"text":"I got a simple Philly steak and it was really good. They have a wide variety of thing to put on it at NO EXTRA charge; from vegetables to sauces to fresh veggies and grilled things (also some that do have some charge but that's depending on your taste).  And even more options to come back for a second visit.  They also offer poutine, hamburgers and side-orders to go with the Phillies. While I was waiting for my food to go I saw the humongous sizes of poutine they sure will fill you up; I got the regular size and surely was more than enough.  The prizes were a little more than what I would usually spend of a meal but really they stuff it with so much meat I know where that money is going to. When you enter there's just so much to take it better ask for some help to order something that suits you."}
{"text":"I am from Philly originally, and I decided to try this out after some people have told me it was good.  I am sorry to say this is nothing that is even close to a authentic cheesesteak.  For the ones who thinks this is good, go to Philly, get a real cheesesteak from there, and then compare."}
{"text":"I am no food critic but the philly cheesesteak was just average. It feels like something's missing. I liked it though and the place being local makes it a bit more enticing. Also had the bacon cheesesteak poutine and it was nothing compared to my fav poutine spot, smokes."}
{"text":"Happy that they added this to the stockyards area! Sandwiches are very good. Haven't had a chance to try the poutine yet."}
{"text":"Been coming to this joint for about a month now. Great sandwiches. I normally order their regular philly Cheesesteak and the meat is so delicious mixed with their nice warm bun, with melted cheese, mmmm! They have friendly staff who will assist you and answer your questions. The guy there told me they will have the delivery app up soon (SkipTheDishes), but I really don't mind making the short drive since I live in the area. You can call in advance and place your order. Other choices in the area for me would've been subway, so I would rather go with these guys. They really make terrific sandwiches. So if you're ever in the area of Oak Ridges, you should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is literally filthy. Almost the worst sandwich I've ever had. Pouting was actually disgusting.. we could not finish it. The price was also ridiculous. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 small philly cheese steaks, and a chilli heart burn poutine  It was just ok.  The fries are homemade with is good. But they general gravy/sauce is mediocre.  The philly cheese steaks need a more crusty bun the soft bun gets super soggy after a few mins. They were more like ground beef then steak.  I probably wouldn't make the trip again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try for a while and finally stopped in. I got the pulled pork with sweet memphis bbq and it was DELICIOUS!! It was tangy and flavorful and all around good. I also got a poutine but it was just too much food for 1 sitting. I look forward to trying more items off the menu."}
{"text":"Now I know why Comedian/Podcaster Adam Carolla named his precious dog \"Philly Cheesesteak\"! I've never had the opportunity to be in Philadelphia and try one but I will bet it's not as good as the one I had at Philthy Phillys in Newmarket.  When I first noticed their sign while driving along Davis Dr, I immediately thought, \"Yuk, who would name their restaurant Filthy Anything?\" But great reviews on Yelp enticed me to go there. When you walk in to place your order, the young lady at the cash is very pleasant, helpful, and patient. The \"Boys\" working on the grill and handling the food are very courteous and clean and smiling. Nothing is Filthy in that establishment. Have you ever seen a hog rolling in mud? Or for that matter, ANY animal OR human, rolling in mud?They are totally filthy but totally happy!! That's how you will feel when you eat one of these amazing cheesesteak subs, loaded with jalapeños and Philthy Sauce! Diets begone! I'm gettin' down and dirty and Philthy Happy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to post this because there wasn't a listing for this location at the time. I went probably the first couple of days they were open (August 17), so I hope it's gotten better since.here are some notes I took at the time.   7 behind counter I order a basic 8\" philly cheese steak and small poutine to get a baseline. Ordering a sandwich with a poutine gets a free drink, which should be expected, at $16 for the meal. I am order 124. It is 8:47. 10 mins, still waiting. It's clear many on staff are still being trained. The lady at the till breaks often to organize and tell her colleagues how to do things. Behind counter, they're living up to the name. Lots of bits and pieces on floor. She calls my bill at 8:51 and I go for the house sauce and some mustard. Overall tasty, but the steak is dry. Could have used maybe a minute less on grill. Bill 129 is called at 9:06 just as I finish my sandwich.  For a fast food place, needlessly slow. The beef was overdone and dry. For that price, standards should be higher."}
{"text":"Seriously yummy! Haven't had any great philly cheesesteaks in a long time. This place is fairly busy but still not packed enough to not get any seats during weekday dinners."}
{"text":"Here for the first time pleasantly surprised portions huge, shared a philthy sized poutine and large cheese steak still had left overs. One of the better cheese steaks north of Philly. Check it out."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  This place is one of my favourite food places, period. We always get the Italian Stallion and the Crooked Greek and we've never walked away disappointed.  Things I love about this place: - it's super filling- I always get the \"regular\" size and it gets me so full - so many delicious & creative takes on a classic philly cheesesteak - so many sauces to choose from!!! and quite a few cheeses too - it is STUFFED- it's messy to eat because of just the sheer amount they stuff inside those buns - speaking of buns, they are so soft and delicious and go PERFECTLY with the meat and cheese inside   I haven't tried their poutines yet, but they're probably so good, judging by how good the cheesesteaks are.   I highly recommend this place, it is so good I just can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Just added this buisiness as it has just opened in the last couple days. Very clean location. Order was quick but took a little while to make (much to do with the fact that i got the 12 inch which is giant. Fairly expensive too at $13.99, but wow do you get a lot.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Do Not try and bring home. They put so much delicious steak that it will be 10x more messy. But thats half the fun!  Do not go here if you mind a messy meal, but if you love delicious cheese steaks than this is your spot."}
{"text":"The standard cheese steak was amazing, better than the one I had in Philly to be honest...the chili cheese fries were not great, I really didn't see any cheese, however I'll definitely be returning for more of the sandwiches. My big problem was that it was me and another customer waiting, I went up to the gentleman at the cash who was friendly, pleasant and helpful, left a tip for him, then went over to get my cutlery and whatnot...I then couldn't help but over hear him bringing a sandwich to the front and putting the final toppings on while a female coworker began yelling at him!!! I was APPALLED! With customers standing right there to yell at another employee is so inappropriate...the most ironic thing about it is that she yelled \"I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU LEARN\"....let me tell you, there are probably about 4 million different ways to help someone learn and THIS is not one of them. This female employee then looked at me to see that I was clearly staring at her with the look of disgust on my face...she then walked away from him after another moment, then was the person to assist me at the front with my final toppings and seemed to overly try to be friendly and nice to me...not impressed and I hope that this isn't a regular situation, for if I see it again, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"A good place for a quick bite poutine and cheesesteaks. The staff are super friendly and helpful. A good selection of cheese for your cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks back while visiting the area for work at the suggestion of a work colegue. I would say the food was OK, not like Pats or Gino's in Philadelphia. Might give it another try when I'm back in the area again."}
{"text":"Because I wanted a taste of Canada, I went ahead and tried the poutine. YUM! LOL I am not sure how it taste in other spots but since this was close to my hotel, I gave them a shot and was in love.   If you are around the area, give them a try."}
{"text":"I had the steak poutine and it was so good! Enough gravy and toppings to make the fries flavorful. I really like the fries as well.  The prices are a bit high to go regularly but I'd definitely go back if I wanna splurge a bit for lunch :P"}
{"text":"FIRST location (372 Yonge St) to serve 100% HALAL chicken/beef!! (Meat source same as Villa Madina)  Owner really knows and went lengths to get seperate grill to cook just the chicken/beef. Even put on new gloves to cook     They do serve Pork - also some items like chicken wings is not halal because that comes from the franchise - MUST say you want \"halal option\" this way they know to cook it on different Grill!! They don't use different chicken, they just cook it on different Grill!! The Poutine Gravy is ALSO halal.   Amazingly delicious sandwiches AND poutine! I can't even talk bout it - I do recommend this place! I'll be going again fo'sho! -- my new place to go! Lots of styles of sandwiches!!   Copyright photos - theKhanaGuy"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and service, quick wait about 10 mins. Great prices and delicious food. Got the Phil up 6\" sandwich fries and a 24oz drink for 9.99"}
{"text":"I have a really hard time finding a poutine I like. This place okay but doesn't quite hit the spot. Good fries, nice gravy, but in future I'll ask for less of it, as the fries were soggy. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Poutine was amazing. The cheese curds were generous and the gravy was the perfect flavor and consistency. The fries were crispy and fluffy, perfect for absorbing the gravy.   The cheesesteak on the other hand is flat out bad. It's expensive and the portions are tiny. I had it with their signature sauce and I gotta say I'm not impressed. The sauce is basically barbeque and really sweet. Overall it was terrible value and taste. For the cost I'd rather go find a pub/restaurant that serves a French Dip (my go-to place is State and Main) and get way more for my money. Honestly I think I might rather get a subway cheesesteak footlong than a footlong of this.  Skip unless you're here for the poutine."}
{"text":"I visited this location yesterday and it wasn't as good as my original visit. This was the first actually going into the restaurant usually I ordered delivery. The place is soooo insanely messy there were trays of garbage and food left from people who had eaten and didn't clean up. I understand staff can't control that but they could have cleared off the tables for the next customers; gross.  We waited probably a good 10minutes maybe for our food and it was wrong so I informed the girl working. They put the sandwich in the bag and the other food and I left. Well I come to find out once I got home that they messed up and ALSO gave me someone else's order.   The food was good as usual but it's not what I had ordered and I was so far away I didn't want to drive back. I will stick to delivery in the future."}
{"text":"It's huge, it's sloppy, it's indulgent and its way better tasting than it has any right to be! Listen, its a lot of meat and cheese and sautéed vegetables stuffed into a bun.  It was more than I could finish but if you've got the appetite it's quite a meal.  The quality of the food isn't anything special for flavours but its definitely better than a burger chain, and I'd recommend it for deep hunger or deep drinking."}
{"text":"We went back again today. about 3 months after our first visit.  While portions are still large, the quality has gone down.  The beef was not as good quality and it was cut improperly (with the grain instead of against and too thick) so it was very tough and hard to bite through and chew.  It still tasted good, although they were very stingy with the lettuce, but because of the tough meat it was not as enjoyable.  Also the service was terribly slow for a fast food place.  We ordered at 1:14 and there were only 2 other customers in the restaurant plus an employee on lunch break, and it took 20 minutes to finally get our food. They seem to be struggling a bit if the lack of customers during lunch rush on a Monday and the lower quality of ingredients was any indication."}
{"text":"Overall above average establishment, I had the standard poutine and classic Philly cheese steak sandwich. The sandwich wasn't anything too special but was tastey enough to warrent a return visit. I'm no expert on Philly cheese Sandy's but I feel like a toasted bun would have given the taste experience an extra dimension. The poutine was very good however, very flavourful gravy with even coverage throughout."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at a Philthy Philly's and I enjoyed my Philly Cheesesteak. I had passed by it many times before so when I saw the deal on Groupon I decided to buy it so I would finally go and try it. I brought my sister and her boyfriend along with me.  I ordered a regular Philly Cheesesteak. I got onions, green peppers, and jalapenos on mine and went with the Jalapeno Monterey Jack cheese. Mushrooms and banana peppers were the other free toppings you could choose from. Once my sandwiches was ready I got to pick our sauce so I went with Southwest Chipotle and Philthy Sauce. If you like horseradish, my sister and her bf love Jeanette's Kicked up Horsey sauce. Her boyfriend got one of their poutines. I dont know if I would come here for their poutine, probably just stick with the sandwich. We also got a regular order of the feta fries to split.  I liked the flavour of everything together and thought the size of the sandwich was very filling, although it wasn't very cheesy. Fries were under dressed, but okay. Prices do seem a bit high for what you are getting and there is a good wait once you order your food. I will probably return eventually now that I know I can get a decent Philly Cheesesteak here."}
{"text":"I had pretty high hopes for this place, and while I must admit the sandwich was pretty darn tasty... The whole experience from the neurotic lady at the counter that doesn't let you finish speaking and continuously interrupts when you ask a question to their odd sizing methodology. Seems they have over-branded common sense. You know like when you want a small size.... you ask for a small anywhere else (except Starbucks). Here you have to ask for a Phil size. When you want a large you have to order a philthy size. Add to the conundrum they use the words philthy and philly on their menu items. Try deciphering this order out....\"ordering 1 Philly cheesesteak phil size, 2 # philthies 1 philthy size and 1 Phil size and 1 fat philly philthy size........ what could possibly go wrong? The lady taking the order was confusing in every aspect. I asked for clarification (we had a large order) and she kept interrupting me so I continually had to stop, restart.... honestly it was the single most frustrating as heck ordeal trying to understand this sizing system they use. She wasn't making matters better either. In truth I was starting to get so annoyed I was just about to ask her to please stop talking and let me finish. In short they're tasty sandwiches that are overpriced and over branded in their own confusion. Don't think I'll be coming back or recommending them."}
{"text":"OK Newmarket and GTA, it's time for me to lay some northern knowledge on all a y'all! Something is happening in Newmarket... something wonderful. From Davis drive to Mulock new business is booming and they're throwing away the healthy trends in exchange for big unadulterated flavour!  After losing my left and right leg to Home Outfitters moments before, I was looking for tasty, comfort food at a decent price. It was then that I noticed the large Philthy Phace of Philly's on a bright orange sign only a few doors away. If you're not familar with the area, it's located in the Goodlife plaza on the South -east corner of Davis Drive and Yonge street.  In a world where up is down, black is white and bad is good, then Philthy is clearly code for PHREAKING PHANTASTIC. No Phucking around!! (see it doesn't count as swearing if you don't write the actual word).  It's a simple take away joint, the first of it's kind offering two main menu items and that's it: Poutine and Philly Cheesesteaks. D-LISH!  There are approximately 8 different varieties of poutine ranging from original to a bacon steak burger (yes bacon and steak on poutine). And if that's not enough food for you, you've got about 6-8 variations of cheesesteaks to choose from as well.  I always feel it's best to evaluate a food style on it's basics and then expand from there. I went for their supreme philly which was PHILTHY (in a good way). It's exactly as they're made in Philadelphia right down to being coated in Whiz (cheese Whiz that IZ...). You get 6oz of steak, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers all on a fresh top cut bun, and if whiz iznt your thing, no worries you have 3 other cheese options available to you (Cheddar, Swiss OR Provolone).  For my money this was a fantastic sandwich, and for only being 6 months young, they've got a concept that I know is going to be a huge hit here in the 'burbs and beyond!  Looking forward to many a philthy meal in the phuture!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Their poutines are great for the quantity, straight forward gravy and sauce. Great customer service. The sandwiches are ok, I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce on my cheesesteaks so it was kind of a surprise (maybe next time I'll ask for no sauce)."}
{"text":"The best place for poutine in the area!! i got the philthy size poutine for me and my brother and they really pack it it. easily feeds 3 people. the workers are extremely kind and knowledgeable about the menu. customer service is 100% amazing place we will continue to come for the food and the people."}
{"text":"Came in not long after opening and they had a cater/delivery order on the go so service took a little bit but the person at the counter was nice. Ordered the regular Cheese Steak Poutine and it was pretty decent and filling. The fries, cheese curds and gravy were all good. I'd come here again if I had a hankering for a decent poutine."}
{"text":"Two stars, two words: sad sandwich.   I read somewhere that the cheesesteak sandwich here was one of the best in Toronto, so I wanted to try it during the Tuesday Special ($5 for 6\" cheesesteak).  You choose the meat (chicken or steak), sauce (chose Ancho Chipotle which came straight from a huge Hellman's jug), one cheese (with or without Cheese Wiz) and toppings (green peppers, mushrooms, onions, hot peppers). I passed on the Cheese Wiz and green peppers, and what I got was a very lame sandwich.The small mound of mushrooms, onions and steak barely made a thin layer on that skinny bun. Tastewise, uneventful.   As I sadly ate the sandwich, I kepy eyeing my neighbour's which was overflowing with meat. Maybe if they added 5x the amount of meat, I would be happier. Definitely not what the photo advertises. Walked home thinking that I could've made a way better sandwich for $5.   If I come back, it would be to try the poutine (also $5 on Tuesdays)."}
{"text":"The service was great. The place was very clean. But wasn't too fond of the Philly steaks, the spices seem off and the texture is kind of weird because it was sort of like ground beef."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out and see how \"authentic\" they really were.  Nice clean place... no odd smells which is a good thing... ordered and Philly cheese steak that was \"phil\" sized so only about 6 inches... with sauteed onion, peppers mushrooms and American cheese... no cheese wiz option as a Philly cheese steak should have...with a poutine...   Got my food and noticed a few things off the bat... bread wasn't as thick as it should have been. Nor was it crusty at all.  Tasty.. but not crusty... realized 2 bites in I got regular cheese rather then the American as I had asked.  Overall, sandwich was passable... not truly \"authentic\" but a passable option.  Poutine on the otherhand was the downfall of this meal.  Fries were food truck inspired... but in general not good...  gravy was really runny and passed over the top of the fries and cheese curd and settled on the bottom... that leads to still cold cheese curds on top with a coating of now cold gravy and soggy fries... finished maybe 1/3 of the fries before I threw in the towel.     Passable over all but stick to the sandwiches here... and review your food to make sure you get the right stuff."}
{"text":"Solid Poutine place, they can be a little fry heavy and short on toppings, but the flavours are very good. Strongly recommend the breakfast Poutine any time of the day."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Checked this place out as the reviews were quite good and I'm always down for a great sandwich especially when it is loaded with meat and cheese!  I had the Philly Cheesesteak and it was packed with rib eye steak and various freshly prepared toppings. It was served piping hot and with a huge list of sauces to choose from. The sandwich came with cheese whiz and you get a choice of an additional cheese - they recommended the jalapeño monterey jack cheese which complimented the toppings fairly well.   If you're a clean freak, they also supply you with plastic gloves to eat with so you know how messy it can potentially get with such a big and hardy sandwich!  The bread was not a true Philly cheesesteak bread but did manage to hold together the ingredients quite well. I would definitely come back again as it was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I'll definitely give them 4 stars for their Tuesday special \"Phil Size\" cheesesteak for $5 +tax, and really great fries with gravy (I'm not really a poutine fan) because everything is pretty tasty and decadent. That said, $14.99 for a moderately stuffed full size sub is a bit steep to me, so only portion vs. price is a tiny bit weak at regular full price.  Provolone plus cheese wiz with only onions is traditional to Philly, and my fave, and I've tried the Chipotle sauce, HP sauce, Philthy Sauce, and horsey sauce and they are all pretty good, as is the quality of the meat & bread, plus I really like their fresh-cut fries.   Which brings me to an old pet peeve of mine - this weird obsession many people have to \"crispy\" as the only measure of a good french-fry.  I couldn't possibly disagree more - the best fries are FRESH-CUT, not frozen, and they show a lot of delicious caramelization flavour - i.e.- BROWN - and they are NOT white, anemic, and made artificially crispy by having some chemical soup of starches applied. The best fries are brown and soft and were whole potatoes just hours ago, and they taste like it, they are not white and processed and crispy, poured from plastic bags of frozen.  The cheesesteaks are pretty good, the fries are VERY good, the onion rings are large and from the freezer and just ok, but overall. I like the place."}
{"text":"Im hooked on the philly cheese steaks here and I don't like it! Food is authentic and delicious! Service is friendly and you can see there is attention to detail when it comes to the preparation of your food which I appreciate. Happy to see new locations popping up around the GTA!  I definitely recommend this philthy place!"}
{"text":"First time here,And it was great to have fresh cut French fries, delicious and yummy,It's good to finally find a restaurant that serves Fresh cut French fries"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite. Ordered a chicken steak and fries. In terms of quality it was great. Peppers and onions were seasoned and grilled to perfection. Price-wise.. $23 is a little on the pricey side. Good atmosphere and good ownership.   Will return with good expectations."}
{"text":"I took advantage of a deal i had with skip the dishes and tried this place out. The experience was decent but not great. I ordered the standard philly with BBQ sauce and mayo, the sandwich was  completely over sauced that i couldnt even see the meat in it. They also stuffed the sandwich with french fries which was  unexpected and not listed on the menu when i ordered. Personally the fries were not crispy enough to be worth putting in the sandwich, so i was forced to pick them out as it  also made the sandwich incredibly sloppy. With that being said. It was still pretty tasty once it was adjusted. I also ordered a basic poutine as well and it looked great, smothered in gravy and cheese curds. Sadly it was ice cold, and quite unenjoyable. Its obvious they made the poutine way too early. They kept the poutine carton open too so it would not get soggy, which was smart, but it was already cold. They also need to staple the paper bag if they are going to do that to prevent contamination. I assume this place would be much better in person."}
{"text":"Excellent, heart-stopping poutine. I got the meat eater poutine, regular size, and it was sooo good (also too huge for me to finish).  Guy at the cash register is a good guy too.  Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 8/10. Overall: 8/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"These guys got the best Philly Cheesesteaks in the city - hands down.  They use the authentic bread rolls for the Cheesesteaks - that's a huge bonus. Can't go wrong with a good sandwich and some onion rings.    Spot is tucked in the back of the unit on Yonge St.  But the guys there are really cool - keep up the good work and the good food!   Oh and don't forget to get the poutine - it's so good.."}
{"text":"Ordered a regular cheesesteak and south of the border poutine(sour cream, beef, tomatoes)  The cheesesteak was pretty good, it was basic beef with toppings. I would say it was worth $10. The poutine we got was size small and $10 but it wasn't very good. The fries wasn't crisp and felt undercooked, the gravy didn't really go together with the undercook fries.  Overall 3 stars because the guy at the counter was helpful but the fries weren't really there.  I would probably stick for the cheesesteak"}
{"text":"It tastes really good but in a Friday night it took one hour for us to get our food. Be prepared to wait a LOT."}
{"text":"Was hoping for this to be a welcome addition to a sad lack of casual dining choices in the Pickering area. But alas, it was disappointing.   The restaurant itself has about 10 tables if you wanted to dine in, but it is still counter ordering and pick up. The main options are Philly cheesesteaks, pulled pork and poutine. We ordered a \"philthy\" poutine (which refers to the size, not the toppings), a pulled pork, a cheesesteak and a peppercorn steak sandwich. There are many  poutine varieties.  The staff were pleasant and helpful to explain options, but it was pretty dead in the restaurant so not sure what it would be when busy. Suggestions for sauces and cheeses were made. Order to exit took about 10 mins.  The food looked yummy coming out, the poutine especially was ginormous, gleaming with gravy and cheese curds. But overall looks were deceiving. The poutine was seriously lacking in gravy. Only the fries on top had any. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. If I wanted plain fries, I'd order plain fries. All three sandwiches were meh. My pulled pork wouldn't stay in he bun. The sauciness of it just disintegrated the bun. It also had a very mushy texture. Also, the hostess gave me grief about wanting to put coleslaw (which they offered as a condiment!!) on my sandwich. She said \"you know this is cold and the sandwich is hot right?\" Um yeah. But hello...classic pairing!! The other 2 sandwiches had same bun issues.  Big portions, underwhelming flavour, disappointing construction. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stop #2 at the Canadian National Exhibition was Philthy Philly's.   Outside of the food reviews that I write, my diet is strictly healthy, whole food, calorically tracked goodness. That's one of the reasons why I approached Philthy Philly's with somewhat of a mischievous delight.  I ordered the Philly Steaklair, which as the name suggests is part Philly cheesesteak, part éclair. Right now you may be thinking that this concoction is a crime against food, and I wouldn't blame you. That being said, I'm ashamed to admit how much I loved this thing! Don't get me wrong; this was far cry from a culinary masterpiece, but the combination of these individual titans of snacking and savoury taste came together to wow my heavily skeptical taste buds from bite number one. The assault of sweetness from the éclair and oodles of whipped cream met with the steak and bacon like it was no big deal. And did I say \"oodles\" of whipped cream? Damn right I did! Check your health at the door and sin a little bit, (a lot bit), with this sandwich.  This thing was too good. Eat it once in your life, then never again."}
{"text":"Delicious original and \"Italian stallion\" with all the veggies and tasty cheese options. Poutine was pretty good too but the onion rings were even better. Service has been super the few times we went and the place is clean! Looking forward to trying more menu items. So glad this place is in the neighb!"}
{"text":"Tried out Philthy Philly's for the first time ever and did so on a whim as there was a Groupon promotion for purchase and Stockyards Village shopping was already on the itinerary.  Visited during the afternoon and it had healthy patronage.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Ordered the Original Poutine in Philthy size, Philly Cheese Steak in regular size and a pop.  Portions were huge and especially with the Groupon deal ($12 for $20), it was an amazing value!  We were satisfied with our picks, would certainly recommend.  Nice to have this in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Completely messed up my order, even after I specified what I wanted on 3 separate occasions. Offered to fix it after giving it to me (which was nice) but I didn't have time to wait another 10 minutes.   Ended up receiving a regular poutine. It was fresh and hot, but honestly nothing special. If I was able to try my order of Greek chicken inside it could have easily been a 4 or 5 star meal/place.   Probably won't be coming back unless management wants to offer a coupon so I can try the dish I initially ordered."}
{"text":"4/5   Put me down as a fan of the cheesesteaks. Visited on a Friday around 12:45, where there was one person in line and a few groups seated and eating. The location is close to work and parking is not a problem in this plaza. Ordered the Phil Meal and got the poutine as well.   The cheesesteak was awesome - the only regret I have is not ordering the Philthy size! There was a lot of steak, and it was easy to chew. The mushrooms, onions and peppers, provolone cheese as well as the Philthy sauce (much better than your regular bbq sace) made up for the slight lack of flavor on the steak. (edit: I got lettuce and tomato as well, but thought it didn't fit too with the cheesesteak and ate them on the side.) The poutine had plenty of cheese curds considering its size, and the fries did not seem overly oily.   At 9.99 for a 6 inch cheesesteak, fries (+$2 for poutine) and a drink, you can't really go wrong (dare I say the value is Philthy?). I was hoping there was an option to upgrade the size of the cheesesteak similar to the fries, but it was a good mix of both of the main offerings.  Even as a fast food sit down spot, the service was attentive and friendly. I remember one person walking in and asking for recommendations and the staff carefully went over the menu with him. Will definitely return when I have a cheesesteak craving (similar to this visit)."}
{"text":"I've been to Philthy Phillys twice now and I was really looking forward to this place opening up nearby my home.   The first time I had a Philly Poutine which I thought was odd didn't come with green peppers, onion, and mushroom standard but I asked for mushrooms and green peppers and they said sure. The poutine was good regular size filled me up and I wouldn't order a Philthy poutine unless I was splitting it with someone else. My complaint however was the wait time it took 15 minutes from order to getting food which I felt was too long for poutine however this was within their first week of opening so I chalked it up to that.  I went back today and ordered a Philthy sized Philly cheese steak and after waiting for almost 20 minutes they realized they accidentally gave my sandwich to someone else, I was pretty irritated and thought something was off when someone who ordered after me was getting a philly before me with that said they refunded me for my Philly and promptly made a new one which was ready in about 5 minute after the mix up. I appreciated that because if they didn't refund me I probably wouldn't have been back again. Anyway onto the Philly I finally got....  Good steak, nice and juicy and they have a lot of sauce and topping options and even various cheese options although I stuck to the original steak mushroom, onion, green pepper and provolone formula without cheese wiz and I added hot sauce and their Philthy sauce which was like a BBQ sauce.   So why 3 stars, well I dock one star for how long I've had to wait both times and I dock another because I compare this place directly to Retro Burger in Ajax which is my go to in Pickering/Ajax for both Philly cheesesteak and poutine and I could have had both a Philly cheesesteak and poutine for the cost of 1 Philthy Philly cheese steak.     This place has good food but I find them a little too expensive and they need to improve the wait times."}
{"text":"I went to school in Philly, and this place so far is the closest to a true Philly cheesesteak I've tried in Toronto.   Ordering the larger Philthy version of the sandwich is highly recommended. There was so much meat that it can't be lifted off the tray without it spilling everywhere. While messy and inconvenient, it does make for incredible value for money and is how they make the cheesesteaks at the best places in Philly(aka Max's).   The fries were not memorable, but I will be coming back for the cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"I'm not on a meal plan or diet, but if I was, my cheat days would be here. This is the place to go if you want over the top sandwich and a poutine.  First the sandwiches. I can't comment on authenticity as I've never had a cheesesteak from Philadelphia, but these sandwiches are very good. The beef is tender and falls apart in your mouth easily. It is served on a very lightly toasted, soft bun. I found the bun choice surprising (expecting a bun dense, crusty bun), but it surprisingly held up to the bulk in the sandwich, and was a nice supporting role to the main parts of the sandwich.  The poutines are absolutely massive. If you come with a friend, sharing a regular poutine should be enough if you both get sandwiches. They have all the right aspects you expect from a good poutine, hearty gravy, squeaky cheese curds, and meaty toppings.  If you come here, plan some nap time after!"}
{"text":"Extremely messy but still pretty good. If you come here you're looking to spend over $10 dollars on food for sure. If you don't like a messy meal this isn't the place for you. Overall though this is a brand new restaurant and their first impression was actually really great. Friendly workers, friendly environment. Some advice don't bother putting vegetables on your cheese steak, I could barely taste them"}
{"text":"$17 for a regular size philly sandwich, an onion ring and drink?  WAYYY Too expensive for lunch... WAYYY Too expensive for takeout. Specially when there is SUPER cheap alternatives available next door? Turtle Jack next door, a sit-in restaurant offers cheaper lunch specials.  Sorry, not going back!"}

{"text":"Amazing here! Super good and affordable ! I love there options and it's kind of like Subway! You can put whatever you want on it ! The bread and cheese is delicious and poutine is amazing !! Super good and it's nice how it's right around corner !"}
{"text":"First of all, the small size \"Phil\" sandwich is tiny. Maybe good enough for a child. Could eat that thing in a few bites and still be starving. Unless it's a snack, don't get the small size. It also lacked filling; the ratio of bread to meat and cheese is too high.   Also, we ordered the \"Philthy\", and they must have heard \"Philly\" and we didn't catch the mistake on the computer screen. Ended up getting the wrong sandwich. Why do they have two sandwiches with similar names?  Also my Cheeseburger poutine didn't come with pickles as it said it would. I guess I was supposed to ask for it, but it was listed as one of the toppings so I thought it was automatic. Maybe the list of toppings are just suggestions?   We ended up going across the street to get more food because we were still hungry."}
{"text":"Love the portions and the staff are always friendly! No shortage of toppings here! I'll always come back to philtys Whitby!"}
{"text":"'Murica... F.U.C. Ya!!  We came here after spending great time at the beach. I got the philly cheese steak with poutine. Tastes philthy in a very good way. Portions are 'Murican. Wonderful, friendly service. Philthy and they know it. If you love philthy, greasy foods then check this place out. Please eat responsibly."}
{"text":"Not impressed with service... they forgot about my order of the original poutine while I was on my lunch break. Took over 10 minutes."}
{"text":"One word: Yummy  My husband and I came here after wanting to try this place out for awhile, so glad we did. When we came in it was somewhat busy with people sitting down eating delicious looking cheesesteaks. This immediately had my mouth watering!   I ordered the 6 inch peppercorn steak with onions and a little touch of whiz. It was so delicious! The philthy sauce (whiskey BBQ) was just perfect and I wish she had put more on it. The sauce definitely brings everything together for me. The taste was good and the fries with gravy were well above what I expected. I mean my husband and I battled out for the last few bites of the fries, I won of course.   Final Verdict: I can't wait to visit again and scoop me a delicious sandwich"}
{"text":"It was a bit of drive for me, all the way in Oak Ridges!   The service was friendly and inside was quite clean. We ordered the O-Ring and Bacon Cheesesteak poutines. I didn't think the medium would have that much food, it ended up being a second dinner later that night.  The fries are fresh cut, real cheese curds, and the gravy wasn't too salty like some places. There were loads of toppings on my poutine and just the right amount of onion rings on mine. The bacon cheesesteak had so much meat on it, quite filling!  The prices are comparable to Smoke's and the taste is just as good.  I did not try the sandwiches and would definitely have to make a return!"}
{"text":"So awesomely polite! I got the Tuesday poutine: regular size original poutine for $5, but wanted smaller size Fort hat price and the guy said no no, you can warm it up later. I don't like it later but he said it will stay crispy. I said, okay I will try just one time. Let's see.   (Eating some now)  (Bring leftover home)  Okay, I heat up the leftover. Maybe I should have placed it in the over, that would just require extra work and cooking. And no, I don't likeas much as when I first got it hot. I gave it to my husband who did not complain. I would just get the Tuesday special with someone else next time."}
{"text":"Very tasty steak sandwiches. Reasonable price for it's portion. Recommend. Friendly staff. We love their fries as well, not frozen MacDonald type but thick and crispy. Very good selection of poutines."}
{"text":"This place while small inside delivers on the food front, I got the larger size, Along with a regular poutine and drink.(\"philthy\"-Their largest size) I had enough food to fill my stomach and then some. a lot of descriptions came to mind for their sandwich, but I will flat out define it as a sub sandwich on steroids. The meat in the sandwich for starters is more then double what a subway,Mr.Sub or Quizno's will give you. the toppings are all spicy(so go easy on the toppings if you're not into spicy food) the bread isn't really the best. But its what's on the inside that really matters. Not to mention they let you choose from a variety of cheeses, for your sandwich. The poutine is pretty cheesy. Every bite delivered cheesy goodness. As for the interior, they could stand to put more full chairs, along with an area to put the tray when done. I witnessed staff having to retrieve trays after customers where done, as there is no room near the garbage to leave your tray. The staff on the other hand are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmm. Mouth closed because I am still thinking about the poutine I had. I am not a fries girl either, so that is saying something.   From the service to the food itself, definitely a 5-star experience. The cooks and servers were young bunch of guys and they were surprisingly professional, fast, and polite!   The poutine: wow, cheese curds galore! I love it! The gravy was nice. The fries!!!!! Fries were not soggy like most other places. They were crispy and thick! Yummmmmmm!   I tried the original poutine and the one with pulled pork. Both awesome! We usually just get regular size and it feeds three people comfortably, before feeling guilty about the food. I will wait to try their Philly cheesesteak, which I am sure is \"PHilly\"nomenal."}
{"text":"Seriously, naming a restaurant Philthy is akin to saying Bomb in an airport, it should never be done, but Once you get over the name and step inside you find a clean eatery with some good to great sandwiches depending on choices.   They also offer lunch combo which is a good value. I've tried a few of their sandwiches including original and big texan and I'd stick with the original with as little sauce as you can get by.  Staff are very friendly and more than happy to help with selecting a 'wich."}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered a bacon poutine and a peppercorn steak sandwich. Everything was pretty much perfect and looks like everything is made to order. You even see them laying strips of bacon on the grill so you know theres no warmed over stale crap like most places.  The ingredients seem good too. The gravy is very tasty and the large choice of sauces all sound good.  My only slight complaint was the fries could be a bit crispier. Maybe I'll try ordering them well done next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot.  Sought it out due to our other option being temporarily closed and am glad we found a new spot.  You get your choice of cheeses which is nice and the philly cheese steak ranked among the best I have tasted so far in Toronto.  Will most definitely be back to try out different options on cheat days.   Recommended eats for all who can."}
{"text":"Wow this is a nice addtion   First they are located right next to Fat Bastards which makes it in the right location  I tried the Philly with peameal  I think it was the Canadian one  Was amazing  Love the choices on the menu  Definitely hit the spot  I am looking forward to trying more, especially the poutine menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Got a Groupon deal to try this place out. The place was nice and clean and the service was good. We got the classic cheesesteak and a poutine. Sandwich was good, just the right amount of meat and cheese but I think the bun would be better if it was steamed or toasted just a little bit more but that's personal preference. Poutine was great, lots of gravy and cheese curds all throughout - not just thrown on top like most other places. Price point was pretty good for the amount of food you get so I wouldn't even mind paying full price."}
{"text":"Saw this place on groupon and figured it was a great way to try this place.  Went there on a Tuesday and they had \"choose day\" specials but you can't order any of the specials when you use the groupon.  Ordered Philly cheesesteak, pulled pork sandwich and a poutine.  Everything tasted yummy! They had so much variety for the cheesesteak sandwiches and the poutine that I will definitely go back to try the other variety."}
{"text":"If I reviewed this place 2 years ago it would have gotten 5 stars. But it has gone downhill so much I don't expect them to last thru the summer.  In the past the cheesesteaks were pretty heavy with lots of meat and cheese as you'd expect.  Last visit, I think the weight of the meat was about what I'd have gotten from a hot dog, you could barely see the (finely grated) provolone cheese among the meat, and there was a very thin layer of cheez whiz on the bread -- in the past the meat would be dripping with melted cheese.  Prices have stayed high -- when the quality/quantity was better you could justify those prices, but no longer.  In the last 2 months they have been selling a lot of Groupons.  As in, every day I get a reminder email from Groupon recommending I buy one for Philthy Philly's (for both locations!). An obvious \"tell\" of a failing business is when one that has been around for a few years suddenly starts to oversell Groupons.    So if you want to try this place, buy some Groupons and use them right away, don't wait.  You expect Groupons for new businesses trying to attract new business. This place isn't new.     Going stingy with the cheese is an obvious cost-cutting measure (to maybe reduce the revenue hit from selling Groupons) but it shows how far downhill this place has gone."}
{"text":"I came a few weeks ago with two of my friends. The plan was to get poutine uptown, so I looked up poutine on Yelp. No one replied to my talk thread, but this place seemed promising, so we came. We ordered two philthy (think the largest size they have) poutines to split. We got the smoke show (smoked meat, mustard, pickle) for $13.99 and the perogie poutine (cheese perogies, sour cream, bacon, and sauteed onions ) for $14.99. They aren't the cheapest poutines, but they are massive. The three of us tried so hard, but we couldn't even finish one. We finished about half of each. They really load these boxes up.   The smoke show was less heavy than the perogie. Having the mustard and the pickles helped quite a bit. The periogies on the perogie poutine were the fluffiest perogies I've ever had, and they had at least six of them on the poutine. My favorite part of that poutine (other that the perogies) was the caramelized onions. Those were nice and sweet. I wonder if they'd let me do a perogie poutine next time with perogies instead of fries. Hm...  Service was quite friendly. I asked if we could try a few of their sauces. The girl at the counter got out a bunch of small plastic sauce containers, and squeezed them basically full of every sauce we wanted, and we wanted at least six or seven. We weren't charged for them either, and we very easily could have been. When I asked for a bag so we could take the leftovers home, the guy at the counter said that if he'd known it was only the three of us, he'd have told us to order less. That was a nice sentiment, whether it was true or not.  Next time I want a poutine fix uptown, I know where I'm going!"}
{"text":"If you're nearly dying of hunger, you need to visit this restaurant. The portions are huge. I had a peppercorn Philly cheesesteak with southwest chipotle sauce and fries and really enjoyed it. I have also tried their o-rings which are so good. My husband often orders a poutine and brings it home to share because it's a generous portion. I will have to go back and switch it up and try something new because their poutine varieties sound so mouth-watering from their description on their website. The service is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good service... that's a great start.  Fries are really good I have to say.. done right.   Poutine is good and hot with melted cheese.   I'm going back for the fries and poutine for sure.  The cheese steak is fine but there is nothing special about the bun or the ingredients but it's fine.  Growing up in Montreal I have high expectations of poutine and subs."}
{"text":"I just found out about this place and was really looking forward to it.  Unfortunately I was disappointed with the experience.    Let's start with the good stuff... friendly service, big portions, lot's of toppings, great presentation, nice place.  My food arrived and it looked great!    Then I take a bite and get this liver after taste from the meat... yuk!  This tends to happen when using poor or cheap cuts of meat.  Three words... 'eye of round'.  That is the cut of meat you should use for a Philly steak.  On top of that the steak wasn't seasoned and overcooked/dry.  You get this impressive amount of fries and onion rings, but the oil they were cooked in was dirty so they were dark and oily.  Really it's a shame as they have the right idea... great marketing, menu and the right approach to building a Philly steak the way you want it.  Unfortunately the quality just wasn't there.  I don't know if it's the same at the other location or if this is just a management problem at this location.  In any case I drove a long way to try this place and was disappointed.  You can get a much better Philly steak at Retro Burger or Pete's Big Bite."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today but 100% coming back the sandwhiches were great coleslaw was also great it was quite garlicy but i personally liked it the array of cheeses and sauces was great i loved it"}
{"text":"The sandwich is really good. My friend and I got a Philly cheese steak and a regular notorious poutine. The poutine comes with a very big size which is enough for two ppl sharing. The cheese curds and the toppings of the poutine are rich, and the fries tastes fresh. The sandwich has rich fillings. The store looks pretty clean and organized. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak sandwiches. Pulled pork is awesome. Onion rings are great. Still have to try the poutine. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is my second time going and it was even better than the first.  I ordered a foot long Big Texan (beef) with: jalapeno monterey jack cheese, the usual sauteed peppers/onions, sauce (philthy sauce, horsey sauce and either southwest chipotle or ancho chipotle... whichever one looked creamy....I can't remember)  Went with a group of people so I was able to try the perogies poutine and I have to say that I found the combination a little weird. The gravy with the sour cream...those flavours just did not mesh well in my opinion. Overall I was underwhelmed by the fries.   The staff was friendly and the seating area was  clean.  I would recommend this place for the sandwiches."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic poutine and the philly cheese poutine in the regular size. The fries were not greasy and the gravy and cheese curds were perfect.   We ordered our food a bit before noon, and it seemed as though we were the first customer of the day. But it picked up very quickly.  Definitely will return if we are in the new market area."}
{"text":"We ordered the regular (8\") and the 'Philthy' (12\") of the 'The Big Ez'. The portion is very big so unless you are a big eater, 6\" version should be more than suffice for most people. The taste is good but expect to drink a lot of water later on, it is a bit heavy on the salty side (but I guess the Philly steak sandwiches are suppose to have stronger taste than most) For the poutine, we ordered the buffalo poutine. This was way too salty! It was almost inedible. If it weren't for the poutine, I would have given four star (price was a little steep, I felt)"}
{"text":"Only one choice of bread   Depending on what sandwich you choose the buns get soggy/ greasy. So eat there !  They have teenagers in the back who make your sub sloppy greasy wet  Not that pleased   And the Phil up leaves you hungery"}
{"text":"first time recommendation is to go classic...don't bother with the poutine because its really standard, but the sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. There is a bit of a waiting time, about 10 minutes. They have quite a few options, both of poutine and sandwiches. Good selection of cheeses and sauces also. I had the original cheese steak sandwich. Was good. Chose the wrong cheese though. But otherwise was really good."}
{"text":"\"Philthy\" size is quite huge! For 2 people it was dinner and breakfast.  Very tasty, we got pulled pork Poutine. There was a lot of meat, a lot of cheese curds, and gravy was even through out the massive amount of fries.  Great value too.  It's nice to see the kitchen space, where everything is cooked and prepared in front of your eyes. The restaurant is clean. It's probably really nice in summer, as there is a huge \"window garage door\" that probably stays open on warm summer evenings"}
{"text":"This place is a hard read.  It has the look of a chain, with decor and menu boards that look institutional, but still seems like a single mom and pop operation.  I ordered a quick lunch, consisting of a traditional Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, fries and a drink.    The meat on the sandwich was nothing impressive, fairly bland, a bit tough, and with a bit more fat and tough bits than the real deal I have had in Philadelphia. The onions and green peppers were undercooked, and the cheese did not seem to blend correctly.  Overall, it is not a bad lunch, but it didn't offer me any reason to return when there are so many other options.  Try it for yourself, just to be fair.  UPDATE:  I decided it was time to give it another try. I ordered the Big EZ. Overall, it's a pretty substantial sandwich for $10. Flavour was good, but still there is a gaggable chunk of gristle in every bite. If they would trim the meat or use a slightly higher grade, I would automatically jump up my rating by 2 stars."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  I love poutine and I'm very picky about it.  This was pretty good.  They used real curds and used fresh ingredients.  I felt like the gravy could have had more flavour.   It's a great place to stop for a quick bite,  prices are pretty good and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Wowowo. This place is great! So tasty. My only issue is the slightly high pricing, but in all fairness the ingredients are fresh and very yummy. I definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, very clean and friendly; service was impeccable. Got a Philly cheese steak and protein, protein was outstanding, cheesesteak wasn't that great was tasty enough but just didn't have something, can explain what it was missing other than an outstanding flavour that would bring me back"}
{"text":"Way overpriced but these cheese steaks are good! Had seen them at the CNE however, they were running a limited menu and using hot dog bread instead of the regular soft bread they use at this location. You can choose a cheese and add toppings to your cheesesteak. I chose to do it Philly Style and just do cheese and steak and hold the onions. It took about 5 minutes to make as they make it fresh infront of you.  Overall the sandwich was really good however it is about the size of a 6 inch sub from Subway (perhaps a little bigger) but it did codt me $10 for just the sandwich which I found very overpriced for what I received.  Id go back though."}
{"text":"Ann was a doll! She could tell by our blank stares that we were newbies. She patiently explained the menu, our choices and many options, gave us a sampling of their many sauces and guided us toward what we would like (she's tried everything on the menu and can give you tips on the best and popular combinations). Love how customizable the menu is: feel free to add or subtract, mix and match.  OUR ORDER: -The Big Texan with steak, pulled pork, bacon and onion crisps. Hubby added Jeanette's Kicked Up Horsey Sauce DELISH! - Triple Cheese melt (you pick the cheeses) with mozzarella, spicy jack cheese and provolone with beef topped with the Philthy sauce (40 creek whiskey bbq sauce). - Sides were small order of onion rings and fries; fries were better would go perfect with some malt vinegar.  Both sandwiches were delicious but Hubby's Big Texan with three meats had a better bun to meat ratio. The bun was soft but stood up well to all the meat and sauce in the sandwich, no falling apart or getting soggy. Note to self: make sure sandwiches have three kinds of meat on them, always add sauce and definitely top off with those yummy onions crisps.  This is a fast food place but you get attentive, excellent, individualized customer service: both the cashier and cook came out to check on us SWEET! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious! Bought coupons from Groupon, worth the drive!  Husband, daughter and I ordered a pulled pork poutine, original Philly cheesesteak sandwich and Big Eh, very yummy. Staff was very friendly as well.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I came across Philthy Philly's on groupon which has an awesome $12 for $20 value discount.  Upon entering the restaurant, I took one look at their intense menu selection and had a difficult time deciding what to get as it all looked so delicious!  The server I think was the owner as he was extremely pleasant and explained how everything works as well as being very much appreciated of my business considering I was using a groupon. I ended up spending an extra $15 on top of the $20 as we were very hungry.  The portions are huge, we ended up getting the original Philthy size (largest) regular philly cheesesteak, the BIG EZ Phil size and a regular Philthy size poutine. The food was delicious, but VERY VERY sloppy. There really is no delicate way to eat a cheesesteak LOL.  There is quite a few tables to eat in as well as the option for takeout. I'm definitely a fan and will be back!  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Went in with an entertainments book coupon, no issues, food was great, poutine is super huge, could feed four for sure, Twitter sandwiches cost me eight bucks, total!, super yummy, would go back and back and......you got a Custee for life!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I love this place. To me, the food is worth the price. Really delicious here and I love the poutines. Living in pickering, the closest available smokes is in Oshawa. Thankfully, this place steps in to fill the void... And at times, does an even better job than smokes.  People working there have been nothing but kind and polite. Really helpful and nice. I highly reccomend going here."}
{"text":"I passed by in the evening and decided to grab some quick food. I ordered the regular sized sandwich and regular poutine to share with a friend. We were actually excited to get some good food but we were so disappointed.   The poutine did not look appetizing at all. The cheese curds did not melt enough to stick to the fries. I was eating cheese separately from the fries which was not was I expecting. The fries were soggy in general. The poutine was just really disappointing.   The sandwich meat was extremely bland. Barely any flavor.   Everything was disappointing. I don't want to be so harsh and I'm generally quite lenient to new businesses since I know it's tough trying to figure things out at first. But given what I had, I probably won't return and give it a second try."}
{"text":"Delicious! I find myself craving poutine from here on a regular basis, and there are so many different flavours to try!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Philthy Phillys for the first time last night, and it was amazing. I got a philly cheese steak and he got the peppercorn steak sandwich and we shared the buffalo chicken poutine. The sandwiches were tasty and very filling. He ate his and I ate half of mine and we were full. But we still had the poutine so we tried our hardest to eat it, but it was like the size of my head. Good food for your money, big servings. Staff were very friendly and it wasn't too long of a wait!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Very friendly. I had the steak salad and they packaged it very nicely."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I had no intention of coming here originally.  I was just actually next door at the Home Outfitters and felt the hunger impulse to buy something to eat.  After trying them out, I'm really glad I did.  The restaurant isn't huge, and kinda reminds me of a pizzeria, but has a pretty good selection of cheesesteaks and poutine.  Ya, I wasn't exactly sold on the poutine, so I just got the original cheesesteak.  When I ordered the cheesesteak, they asked if I wanted Provolone on it, and I said I wanted cheese whiz on it.  They then asked if I was actually from Philly because they noticed most people that ordered it that way were actually from Philly.  Who knew =)  The sandwich is served in a hoagie bun.  I actually really liked the sandwich.  Aside from the bun (that kinda reminded me of a hotdog bun), I really liked the consistancy of the meat as well as the seasoning.  Not sure about other people's reviews on it (maybe it's hit and miss) but I really enjoyed mine.  It's not everyday that you're surprised by a restaurant, but I really think Philthy Phillys is one of those places that is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Both orders were Philly cheesesteaks and a poutine.  At first I thought $30 was pricey for 2 cheesesteaks, poutine and a fountain drink. However, the portions were large, they do not skimp on the amount of meat. Plus free refills on the drink.  We liked that everything was cooked fresh. They have a huge selection of cheesesteaks, pulled pork and poutine.  We will definitely be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Sandwich was ok but having watched the girl on the register just walk over and cut my sandwich without gloves or washing her hands first makes me uncomfortable with the sanitary practices here.   The onion rings are a rip off (small size $4.19.  The fries are soggy."}
{"text":"I find myself here at least every few weeks if not more depending on when I get a cheesesteak craving, and when I do, this is the place I HAVE to come to. I have yet to find a better cheesesteak in Newmarket and honestly don't think I'll even bother looking so long as Philty Phillies is around.   My go to order is the regular cheesesteak with double provolone, onions and cheese whiz as well as a bacon cheesesteak poutine. I find even getting regular size servings can generally feed 2 people easily but maybe that's just me. The staff is always pleasant and the quality is fairly consistent.   They also recently introduced a delivery option which will definitely enable me to be even philthier than I already am. My love for this establishment knows no bounds so please do yourself a favor and pay Philty Phillies a visit, I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Brilliant.  I've tried to find a proper copy of a real Philadelphia Cheesesteak in the GTA, and honestly, nowhere had it right. The bread was always wrong, it was piled with stuff that isn't supposed to be there, and it just didn't taste like the real thing.  My barber told me to check this place out, and I'm so glad I did last night on my way to BATL. A proper whiz wit - on the right kind of bread, just like an Amoroso Bakery roll you'd get in Philly, and everything was just pretty much bang on.  This is good, and horrible, all at once."}
{"text":"Spent some time at the mall and found this spot online and was not let down. Compared to the powerhouse Smoke's Poutine, Philthy Philly's is a lot better in my opinion. I had the chicken parm poutine and my girlfriend had the pierogi poutine. Both were amazing!   Whats great is everything is made in front of you and seeing other orders being made up makes you decision tough because everything looks great. The staff was friendly and are generous with the toppings the load on. Ingredients are fresh and the fries are fresh-cut instead of fried from frozen.  This is definitely a re-visit as there are so many different flavours and sandwiches to try."}
{"text":"This is a place that satisfies that \"I want something, greasy, cheesy, and delicious\" craving you get every so often. It's all made fresh and really nice.  Thanks to the magic of Groupon, was able to get to try this place for a low low price.   Location: This one specifically is part of a franchise network that seemed to pop up across the GTA. This being on Davis Drive up in Newmarket on the South side of Davis, where you need to be heading Eastbound to get in or turn sharply coming west. If you're coming westbound on Davis you know how much of a crap show it is to get there, but if you're craving it, it's definitely worth it.  Food:  Tons of menu options all around $10 for some classic and crazy poutine combinations. I changed my mind 5 times there are so many things that look great. Ended up with the \"classic\" Philly Cheesesteak combination as well as a Bacon Cheeseburger one. Both of them tasted amazing. \"Cheat on your diet and don't care\" type of good. This is the type of poutine you see on late night Food Channel from a famous food truck or some late night place, and that's a good thing.  They use the fresh-cut, skin-on type of potato for their fries and most items are supposedly gluten free, etc.   Only suggestion is if they added other types of fries to expand their menu like a Cauliflower poutine or even a simple sweet potato fries type of poutine. That would've put it over the top as some other places are doing these combinations with great success.  Would absolutely comeback and have already got a few groupons to do so.   Solid 4.0 out of 5.0."}
{"text":"Came here for a Groupon I had. Friendly staff and made to order poutine.  It's not an authentic \"Quebec\" poutine but it's delicious enough. they are definitely large sizes and the Groupon allowed me to get two large sizes of different flavours. Got a cheese burger and got a pizza.  both were made with generous amounts of cheese and gravy with lots of topping that was overflowing. they put them in a large old fashioned grocery bag Because there is so much they give you! put a seat belt on it and turn the seat warmer up if you're getting take out like I did.  a few recommendations I wish they had Sweet Potato and other starches like Yucca, Taro, and skinny or fat fries too. that would really put it over the top. that's probably a franchise decision though.  I'm definitely coming back if I'm nearby and have that craving for something cheesy and filling. btw a large will feed two people for sure."}
{"text":"I never had Philly cheese steak every in my life. An till this place open. I. almost had all the sandwich there all good I can't my farvt sandwich. If go you be back next day that how good they are. Best it amazing Philly sandwich"}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to the name. Good portion of meat. Good selection of sauces. Quick. Friendly service. Clean. Had the small original with poutine. The small poutine is a meal on its own. Chunky curds and rich gravy. Looking forward to try other flavours."}
{"text":"Tried their cheesesteak sandwich last night, and ONCE will be enough for me!  My beef did not taste good, kind of sour, could be whatever they use to marinate it?  DH didn't care for his chicken sandwich, said the cubed chicken was rubbery and tasteless.  2 stars for the not-from-the-freezer french fries, and the fast & friendly service.   But there'll be no more Philthy stuff in my future!"}
{"text":"Came here to avoid having to cook for a night... best idea ever! I ordered the 12in Big \"EZ\", which had steak, bacon and chiptole sauce.  You get to choose from a variety of ingredients to include in your sandwich.  I ended up getting so much in it that the sandwich couldn't even close! The sandwich was a bit pricey $16 or so I believe, but it tasted great so no complaints there. I'd say a 12in would be able to feed 2 ppl who eat less, but if you're coming here alone I'd suggest getting the 8in."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here a few times tried 2 different Cheese steaks! Love it! Food is fresh! Not sitting around until someone walks in! I was the only person in here today! But it was fast and so tasty! I would normally get a 12 inch but today I got the 8 inch! Love the BBq sauce, and the fact it's served hot! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Really cool concept, been here a few times. Tons of cool sauces and toppings to choose from, poutine done right, great giant onion rings, huge portions and love the addition of cheeze whiz to the philly beef. My only negative comment which would of given philthy 5 stars (I've noticed a couple other reviews with similar comment) is the buns they use, I think they could be better and might be a good idea to offer a whole wheat or gluten free option as well as there are a lot of people these days not opting for white bread ... but aside from that definitely try it ."}
{"text":"These sandwhichs and poutines are huge, in fact, my wife and I shared a combo and i am known for a healthy appitite, alot of flavour, these cheese steaks are an enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak in town. Make sure to have it with some cheese whiz. The onion rings are also a must. Everything's just delicious"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The cheese steaks are as authentic as you can get in this city, giving philly joints like Jimmy Gees, Pat's and Gino's a run for their money.  The large size will be enough for most people, but if you're feeling extra hungry then get the Philthy. You won't be disappointed   Cheez wiz is a must"}
{"text":"We just went for dinner. Had the philly cheesesteak with the ancho chipotle sauce. Was really good. They have loads of sauces to choose from.  Their poutine was great! Kids loved the regular cheesesteak and poutine.  The guy behind the counter helped us figure out the menu and was super helpful."}
{"text":"Everything was great from beginning to end. The menu is simple to follow. I ordered the Philly cheese steak $12.99 for 12 inch. There is option for chicken or steak and of course I went with steak. They ask you what toppings you want. There is onions, mushrooms, green peppers. They aslo ask you what type of cheese you want and you can choose from a large variety. There is also the option to add cheese whiz. There is also a large variety of sauces to choose from. They person behind the counter recommended ancho and BBQ sauce and thats what I went with.   Portion of steak meat was very generous and it was very juicy. The sandwich tasted great. Only complaint is that there were some tough tendon pieces of beef but only a small amount.  Service is very friendly and efficient. I only had to wait about 5 minutes for my sandwich. There is a good amount of seating and decent amount of parking. I do not recommend taking this sandwich as takeout because the meat is so juicy that the bread will get soggy for sure.   Can't wait to come back and try the poutine and pulled pork."}
{"text":"Had their Philly cheese steak,pull pork poutine and salad.  Everything was so tasty and their portions are huge! Will def go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Clean, friendly location. Ingredients taste fresh and service is fast. They have the good chocolate milk and a protein shake too!   Can't wait to try more things off their menu."}
{"text":"Got the regular steak and a Phil steak and a Philthy poutine  Poutine: was a bad choice wasn't a fan of it at all, tasted like the fries were undercooked bad fries to curd ratio. Huge portion yes ... but not enough cheese  Phil/Regular steak: was fantastic the sauces were good as well will come back for the sandwiches for sure !  Needs more cheese though"}
{"text":"Had the steak and poutine with me and bae big portion fries was great great service . Had the 8\" and bae had the 12\" plus poutine came to $32"}
{"text":"Was so excited to see this place finally open and right near home!  This was my first visit to a Philthy Philly's chain and upon entering I was faced with two menus.. One for the cheese steaks (chicken or steak) and poutines. The ladies working there were very friendly and explained the menu to us.  The sandwiches come in 6in, 8in or 12in and the poutine sizing is similar to Smokes Poutine.  I really enjoyed the poutine and as the fries were skin on and very crispy..similar to New York Fries! The medium (regular) size was $6.49.  I'm not sure if we got greedy on the toppings or they are always this generous but my sandwich was loaded up with veggies and sauces that it was impossible to eat as a whole.. I basically deconstructed it.. Nonetheless it was delicious and very filling. The philthy size sub was $15.99.  Between my husband and I we split a philthy size and a regular size poutine and it was very well enough to fill us up!  Overall I think this place is a little overpriced for what it is but definitely great for indulging on a cheat day.. and aside from the complete mess it was to eat the sub..it was quite tasty.. giving out gloves would not be a bad idea!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a classic poutine. Not enough cheese in there. Come on man, do it properly. No need to be stingy on the cheese curds when I'm paying $7.33 for a box of fries. Better off going to Smoke's Poutinerie or somewhere else that doesn't cheap out on the toppings."}
{"text":"The sandwich was tasty.. I ordered through the skip the dishes app... Sandwich arrived missing most of the toppings I had asked for.  However it was still tasty.  It is pricey though for the size you get. I was still hungry after having the regular size sandwich."}
{"text":"We had a large poutine and a Greek sub (small) which came to 20.00  The poutine was enough for 2 or more people and the sandwich was small but a fair amount of chicken.  Feta cheese,mushrooms sautéed onions"}
{"text":"That was one damn good Philly Cheesesteak! I will definitely be back to get my hands on some philthy poutine that I've heard so much about. The price is a little high for a fast food joint but worth it. If it was cheaper I'd be more tempted to try the different options they have."}
{"text":"Philthy size poutine is a must try!! Its huge, you have to be sharing it. I think it looks like a pound of fries!  Place is nice and clean. Staff is friendly.  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!  4 stars for food and service."}
{"text":"I had a delicious Philly Chicken Sandwich with a lot of toppings with melted Swiss cheese and Philly's special sauce. And a medium size poutine with fries that was delish. I ended eating 1/4 of the poutine with fries. So I took the rest in the container for home. Next time I will try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"Can't leave our annual holiday trip home without having poutines! We decided to stop in Philthy Philly's after reading some glowing reviews.   The three of us made a mistake of ordering regular sized each when in reality - a small per person would had been plenty. Fries, cheese, gravy - not exactly the lightest combo especially the specialties we picked.    Philly cheesesteaks, breakfast, and meat lovers - were all yummy choices. The fries were fresh and crispy, the gravy was light yet flavorful, the cheese curds were slightly melted but chewy - the three base ingredients hit all the right notes!  The service was extremely patient and friendly - we were offered all their house-made sauce to try. We tried a handful of the bbq varieties - their Philthy sauce of course being my fav. Honestly though, their gravy and cheese sauce were already so satisfying .. the house-made sauces were just added bonus.  Overall - my fav poutine eatery in the whole city! Would def return to check out other specialities!"}
{"text":"Confession:  I came here with a Groupon, $12 for $20 worth of food, so it was a good deal.  Otherwise, I don't think I would've come here at all because it's out of the way for me, just south of Clarkson GO station.  You hafta choose the kind of cheese, toppings, whether or not you want additional sauce, so it can be overwhelming if you don't like to make decisions.  Here's my breakdown...  Classic Cheesesteak - 3.5-4 / 5 - Even for the standard Classic Cheesesteak, there's a selection of cheese, toppings, & sauce.  Staff was very patient and even offered a sample of the sauces that were available.  Bread was soft.  Cheesesteak wasn't too wet on its own, but it was messy to eat and probably best enjoyed when dining in.  The additional sauce was good.  We ordered the \"Philthy\" size which was 12\" long.  Shareable among 3ppl.  Classic Poutine - 3/5 - This was a bit of a disappointment.  Fries did seem fresh cut, but they weren't crispy.  Gravy was good, but there was too much.  Cheese appeared to be curds, but weren't squeaky and was already melting.  Poutine wasn't layered, just seemed like gravy/cheese was dumped on top.  Chip trucks are better than this.  Again \"Philthy\" size was large enough for 3-4ppl to share!  Service - 5/5 -  Female at the cash register was very patient, friendly, and helpful.  She provided samples of sauce and did place all the hot peppers, jalapenos, & pickles on the side as per request.  Atmosphere - 3.5-4 / 5 -  There are 2 tvs, 1 on CP24 and another playing some HGTV show.  Interior is reminiscent of a Subway and is clean.  However, what I noticed was that it was COLD inside.  It didn't seem like any heat was on.  Overall, it was a positive experience, but not sure if I'd have a strong enough craving to drive that far out for.  Maybe if they improved their poutine?"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday around noon, it was pretty quiet.   Ordered the, original cheese steak sandwich and the breakfast poutine. The sandwich had all the usual fixings of a typical cheese steak sandwich, but the meat was really under seasoned - the sandwich was just bland.  As for the breakfast poutine, it was soggy (we ate it right away - so it wasn't due to the fact that we left it for too long) and the fries just had a really strong smell of peanut oil.  The location was clean, tables were clean.    I probably won't be coming back again, nor do I think I'll try any other Philthy Philly's locations."}
{"text":"Pretty much dinner and a show. Not only was the food delicious with all kinds of options. The servers were friendly and hilarious throw the ordering and dining experience. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My new favourite fast food location in north Richmond Hill!  Fresh ingredients, great selection, super clean and friendly staff.  Finally, something in this area worth eating at as options are very limited.  They've only been open for 2 months but very busy already.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Got a 6 inch Philly Cheese Steak and fries. My bud got a cheese steak and onion rings. We split the fries and onion rings. I ordered provolone and caramelized onions on my cheesesteak and a squirt of the Philthy sauce (whiskey bbq) on one end to taste. Deeeelicious. The bun wasn't authentic (it was toasted and kind of thick) but it's hard to find a place outside of Philly that has the authentic bun. The meat was very tasty with my toppings. Next time I'll opt for the added Cheez Whiz (it's free). The 6 inch was enough for me for lunch but if you're a manly man, go big or go home! Fries were just not good. Soggy. Blech. :( The onion rings were MUCH better. Perfectly crisp and savory. Nom nom! Get a sandwich + side and you get a free, self-serve fountain drink. All in all, it was a good experience, clean, fast, tasty, reasonably priced. Lots of interesting sandwich and poutine options and toppings, too. Parking was available but still very busy for a Monday. I'll be back to work my way through the menu! And will NOT get fries."}
{"text":"I have to say hands down BEST place for Philly Cheese Steak in Toronto. Pretty close to an actual Philly Cheese Steak from Philadelphia. The service was excellent, staff was prompt with the order. Offered suggestions on different sauces and steaks, so I can't complain. Most definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Sorry I had to downgrade the stars.  The food is still fantastic but the food handling is not acceptable.  I went there for lunch today and the girl who made my meal was wearing gloves, took my order and punch it into the system and continued to handle the food with the same gloves.  She never changed nor washed her hands.  I watched her and she continued to do the same with other customers.  I also saw her touching covers, receipts, money, etc and then making the sandwiches.  This is quite gross and can make the customers sick."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like cooking on a Friday night so we decided to try out Philthys. The restaurant is located at Thickson and Taunton on the north west corner across from the Metro Plaza.   The restaurant is bright and open with about 10 tables for dinner in. There was a few person long line but it gave us time to check out the menu. We both ended up ordering poutine, peppersteak poutine for him and the cheesesteak poutine for me.   The guy at the cash was super friendly, my fiancee had a question and he didn't hesitate with the answer. I asked about delivery (Yelp asked me) and he told me that they do delivery, but only in the L1R postal code area as poutine doesn't travel as well as the cheesesteaks do.   We paid and then waited by the counter for our food as the tables were filling up and not long after, our order was ready and we were out the door! They pack the poutine open top in the bag and it kept everything good, not soggy from steam or anything.   I got a few bites into mine before realizing it was the wrong poutine. My fiancée was sure his was right as there was clearly a peppercorn sauce on his. Mine should have had cheesesteak and onions (Cheese Steak Poutine) but instead it had cheesesteak, bacon and peameal bacon (Bacon Cheese Steak).   Best. Mistake. Ever.   My fiancée and I both loved the poutine I got. Bacon is amazing, so not a surprise, but it was fantastic. Both of us said we would order it again for sure. I did try his and it was very good. I definitely wanted the onions he had on his poutine on mine, that would have thrown mine over the edge of deliciousness. Bacon, steak and onion would be great together on a poutine... Anyways the gravy is great, not to thick and not too thin. The fries are handcut with skin on the ends and fried to a golden brown. I think I could eat those fries alone all day. The peameal was nicely cooked, not too chewy and regular bacon was delicious! Not skimpy with the cheese curds at all (poutine sacrilege) and the cheese was nicely melted and stringy under all those toppings.   Overall, great visit to Philthys. They did get my order wrong, but what I got instead was absolutely delicious so I'm confident that whatever we try next will be just as great. Service was friendly and fast, you can't ask for more than that! Dinner for the two of us was around $20 and the portions were very generous even for the regular size!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible for Philly cheesesteak. Loads of meat and lots of options for sauces. Delicious and flavourful. Would not go anywhere else."}
{"text":"What a great way to start a 2018 New Year!  Needed a major hangover lunch and of course, Philthy Phils came to the rescue!  Two of us came in at noon and was kindly greeted by a nice lady. Had the regular original steak cheese stick and regular size classic poutine!  Fresh, fast, yummy and plentiful!  Thank you and we will be regulars through 2018!"}
{"text":"This is the first place that I've had a Philly cheesestake outside of Philly. It's made to order, and offers a variety options. The rolls that are used for the cheesestakes leave a lot to be desired, but all in all they don't detract from it but they don't add to it either.  For a pro tip - all the way from Philly - stay away from the cheese whiz it just adds too much to the the cheesestake ironically.   They also do poutines which I've heard are also really good but don't take word for it.   Also getting mayo on it really adds to the experience.   All in all it offers a respectable cheesestake with sufficient options to have you return more than once."}
{"text":"Came with a Groupon $20 worth of food for $12. Was a good deal!! Had to order an original Philly's Cheesesteak and I side of Rings! It was good. But could be a little pricey if I am to order it on a regular price.  Unlimited toppings, and you can ask for different sauce on the side to try.  Would I come back? Sure. But not without a Groupon, though."}
{"text":"More on the 3.5 side Ordered just a poutine. Didnt find it special or better than any other poutine ive had. Way too much gravy which made the fries soggy . The gravy did hve a good flavour though. The cheese was melted so i wasnt sure if it was curds or grated. Not sure that ill be back. Wasnt wowed at all."}
{"text":"First and last time I will ever go here.   Decide to go for an original Philly Cheesesteak 12\". The price ended up being $15 after tax, (I believe in paying for  quality and it was the first try so why not).    What I didn't expect is the long hair in the food.  That just an issue that should never happen.  For the record, as I took and ate a bite before discovering the hair, the Philly cheesesteak was average.  Definitely wasn't worth the premium price."}
{"text":"We got the \"Big Boss\" and \"Phat Philly\". The two seemed to be pretty much the same thing - just meat and toppings you choose, but Phat Philly had additional fries in it.   I came in with high expectations, so I wasn't too amused. It tasted fine, but it was so stuffed that it was impossible to take bites of. I ended up using a fork to eat it piece by piece (kind of defeats the purpose of a sandwich).   Overall - great experience, but I wouldn't come regularly! I wasn't full after eating this $10 sandwich."}
{"text":"Good food, great staff and service. Menu can be a little confusing as it has many options. I will return"}
{"text":"Had the regular Philly Cheesesteak here and it was fairly large and full of meat and so juicy with alot of provolone. Also added peppers, jalapeno, mushroom and onions. I really enjoyed the sandwich and will definitely be back. I think it's a fair price and one of the top Philly cheesesteak places in town. I will probably try the cheese whiz version to see how it compares to the original cheesesteak in Philly. Also you can order using the Ritual app here."}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich.   Very messy to eat    but always tasty     decently priced"}
{"text":"Honestly I went here last night after paintballing and boy was it so good, the cashier was super chill, he told me a perfect size with what I was going to do the same night and boy was it ever good, highly recommend the place it's looks like a family business but holy they make it perfect like I said highly recommend ."}
{"text":"Someone recommended this place to a friend, so we decided to check it out.  It was not what we expected, and not worth the gas to get there. However there were a few positives:  -BIG, Clear, Descriptive Menu  -Friendly, Helpful cashier  -Family sized fries (Filthy Fries - no seasoning just an insane portion)   Negatives:  -Steak Cheesesteak has ZERO spice/flavor cooked into it   -Pulled Pork was a watery mush that looked like it came out of a blender  -Fries were mehhh and seemed old  -Cook wearing track pants far below his butt with a clear view of his tight white fruit of the looms which clung to his butt cheeks as he prepared food with no gloves on Dude really!!!   -Lettuce and Tomato's were soggy and a hot mess, everything looked very unhygienic and no traditional cheesesteak toppings  -Over $40 for an 8', 12' and Filthy sized fries seemed pricey for flavorless meat and soggy buns.    Overall not happy with the food or the look of this place, and I would never eat anything from here again.    They may want to invest in proper training on food prep, presentation, and personal hygiene."}
{"text":"Went there today to check it out, ive heard of it through the radio a couple of times already.  Ive always wanted to try authentic philly cheesesteaks.  The lady behind the counter was very friendly and very attentive, she tried to explain to us about the menu.  We ended up ordering a small and reg cheese steak plus a small and regular poutine.  Total bill came up to $32, which was a shock to me.  Their portion size was actually pretty big, so i understood why the bill came up to $32.  The philly cheesesteak came with a lot of options for sauces and fixings.  Bread was a little different but held all the meat and vegies together. To be honest i was a little underwhelmed by it, i was expecting legit philly cheesesteak, or maybe it was just me.  Poutine was really good, big portion size. One of the best poutines ive tried.  The gravy was just perfect, not too salty or runny.  Overall it was a good experience for me and my wife, would definitely come back and try the other cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Philthy Philly's invades the east end of the city with an intense lineup of cheesesteaks and poutines that is sure to become a hit with locals. Combo friendly items dominate the menu, with so many options for sides and toppings that you could literally go without eating the same meal twice.   Must-try items:  Philly Cheesesteak (original) Buffalo Chicken Poutine  A medium cheesesteak will set you back about $10 and is completely worth it if you're the type to munch on leftovers. Try out the original cheesesteak with the recommended toppings if you're just getting familiar with this style of sammie. Southwest and chipotle are essential sauces, and for a kick you should ask for sautéed peppers.  Located in a central part of town, this place is easy to access by car or transit. The interior feels spacious and accommodating, and you can see the food being prepared while you wait. Overall, it's a quite clean and cozy environment. Meals are on the expensive side but in the end you'll walk away feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Denfitely will not return. Poor quantity of cheese even though I order the triple cheese and the toppings on the chili cheese fries was about 3 oz. I don't think any of the reviewers had Philly cheesesteak before. I would have much preferred McDonalds."}
{"text":"Oh Toronto...here we go again! This is a charming place and the food is ok. Nothing special but enjoyable enough. But please understand this is not even close to a Philly cheesesteak. From the bread to the meat to the construction. Bread is like a flimsy sausage bun. Meat isn't that sharp rib eye like you get in philly and the normal old cheesesteak wit wiz and onions just doesn't cut it. Maybe try more toppings on yours. Poutine was fine too. Good for a late night drunken snack."}
{"text":"Philthy size Big Texan Cheese steak. Peppers, onions & cheese. Swap the pulled pork for pepperoni. 1 line of mayo.   Never before has humanity been so well enlightened."}
{"text":"Finally checked out this spot and was quite happy with the huge menu of delicious cheese-steaks and poutines! The best part is that the bread is actually flown in from Philly for some authentic tasting sandwiches.  The meat is halal, the gravy for poutines is vegetarian and the portion-sizes are fantastic.  If you're looking for an easy fast-food option that actually tastes good and is worth the $$, then this is your place.  As always, I like to try the staple items at these type of spots so I went with the original philly cheesesteak sandwich with poutine.  I also tried other peoples eats and really enjoyed the onion rings here as well as the philly cheesesteak poutine! Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for just a box of fries and cheese curds to be honest. I have no problem paying a premium price for poutine if it is done right! My fries unfortunately were very undercooked the first time, and then the second time they were overcooked and everything was just mush. Disappointed as the owner told me they were better than Smoke's Poutinerie!"}
{"text":"Located in oak ridges, this Philthy Philly's is easily accessible with a very friendly service. We got the Big \"EZ\" and The Big Boss, both steak and it was delicious. Although we went with the smaller size (Phil), it was amazingly filling. Along with the polite staff (who helped me pick a sauce for my sandwich), the place itself was quite clean and refreshing.   This was my first time at Philthy Philly's chain and I enjoyed every single minute there, especially when I was stuffing my face with food. They also offer lunch combos at a great value which I highly recommend if you're super hungry.   Although Oak Ridges is a bit of a drive, I'm super excited to have a Philthy Philly's in my area and will definitely go back to try the poutine."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome!  Philly cheesesteak is incredible.  Poutine is spectacular!  I often get the pierogie poutine, but I was told by another customer that the notorious PIG is also outstanding, so I'll have to try that next!  They also have onion rings, which I definitely must try, very soon!"}
{"text":"OMG, as I said before!  And  Did you know?  They have PULLED PORK!  I was skeptical at first, I mean, this ain't no bbq joint, right?!   But it is incredible, really fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was not impressed with the food at all. I paid $10.00 for a Philly cheese steak sandwich, it was soft and soggy. Couldn't taste the onions, peppers and mushroom as they were diced really small. I asked what kind of meat cut they use for there sandwich and the person working told me they don't know. Definitely not coming back. The portion size is small for what ur paying for. Food is overpriced."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine and pulled pork sandwiches, and with so many options! So happy I tried this place out and now my family and I can't stop coming back for more! The portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Nacho Libre poutine today for lunch.  I was told came with green onions and adverstised to come with chili, as well with sour cream, jalapeno, and nacho chips. When I got the poutine, it was topped with sautéd yellow onions and jalapeno in salsa sauce - totally gross and not what I expected. The salsa made it sour and did not mix well with the gravy.  There was also no chili on the poutine :("}
{"text":"Not many places for a cheese steak sandwich, but I must say this place does a pretty good job at it. Had a regular steak sandwich with whiz and poutine and left full and happy. Both were very good and has my vote. Portions come in either regular size which is what you would expect in a good size portion and Philty size for those who still believe that super size is the way to go. If you are a cheese steak or poutine fan, this is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Amazing Poutine and friendly staff!! I took my little cousin to have a poutine and we both loved it. Tons of cheese curds and plenty of flavour filled gravy. The nice young lady layered our poutine and went out of her way to share with us the different poutine options available. I appreciate her proactive approach. I recommend this place and I will be coming back. I want to try the sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"March 24th was National Cheesesteak Day and for $5.65 you get a pack-to-the-brim delicious  eight inch Philly. The Philthy sauce is a tangy Forty Creek BBQ sauce that uplifts this sandwich over most others. ACTUAL CHEESE but cheese whiz is available to those with a guilty pleasure. It may be just me but I've noticed some locations attached or near to a Fat Bastard Burrito place. The staff of less than eight are friendly and courteous and the place was a tad busy. Not even a five minute wait? their pouting look really good so I'd revisit on a day vegetables don't matter. YOU WILL GET MESSY HANDS NO MATTER WHAT."}
{"text":"I always recommend Philthy Philly's over a Smoke's poutine, but yesterdays experience was quite something! Service was kind of abrupt and hurried, as there were only 2 girls there, and between manning the cash and cooking in the back for about 15 waiting customers on a Thursday evening, they seemed to be spreading themselves quite thin.  My friend and I were getting take out for us and one more friend, so we decided on getting one medium and one large size, in the meat-lovers and chilli flavours. The girl warned us when we ordered the largest size poutine, but we blew it off as her thinking the two of us were going to finish the two poutines on our own. It wasn't even too bad when we saw it, but once we got home and started to dump them on plates to divvy up, we realized how much of a mess we had gotten ourselves into. (Although it wasn't a bad mess to get into, for $28.)  The meat-lovers was very good, even though I thought it would be overpowering in porky ways. That was a good intro, divided between three people....but then came the large size chilli poutine. I'm telling you now, if you want to get a large, make sure you have four people sharing that thing. Neither of us finished our portions of the large poutine, and it alone would have definitely been enough for all three of us. Sadly, poutine is never that great after a night in the fridge, but Philthy Philly's continues to not fail with their portion sizes. If you really want the best bang for your buck, go straight for the largest size. The price differs for different flavours, but usually finds itself around $13-$15 for the large size, and is good for anywhere from 2 to 4 people."}
{"text":"Sitting in this restaurant right now at 8:30 PM on a Thursday night and realized I had to change my previous rating to 5 stars. Came here with a crowd of 10 people and got phenomenal service, even when we burst in loudly and then debated on what to order for a solid 15 minutes. Service is always great here, immensely friendly and going above and beyond to help their customers feel at home.  Philthy Philly's poutine is pretty standard across their different locations, usually a 3 to 4 stars depending on the variety you order. The Greek-style poutine is my favourite but out of all the Philthy Philly locations I have visited, this is definitely the best. Customer service is insanely good (Philthy's at Victoria Park doesn't even begin to compare to the service here!) We were repeatedly checked up on as we ate, and well-wished and thanked on our way out the door. They even remembered my sister who had last visited 6 months ago!  tl;dr: check this Philthy's out ASAP for great poutine and the best customer service in the GTA"}
{"text":"I don't get fast food that often but I may start doing it a little more after trying the Big Texan  philly cheese steak  sandwich ($9.79 for a small) at Philthy Phillys. Price-wise, it is a little expensive for a sandwich but you gotta keep in mind that you're getting three different meats in here - AND, this is the most expensive sandwich on the menu. The price of the regular is $12.99 and the philthy size is 17.99. The sandwich comes with steak , pulled pork , bacon , and onion crisps. And then you get your choice of toppings and sauce as well as one cheese. I chose to load it up even more with lettuce, tomatoes, olives, provolone  cheese, Philthy Sauce, hickory maple chipotle, apple butter mesquite, and dijon mustard. Yes. It's a lot of sauce, but it's the mix of the sweet tangy spicy sauce contrasted with the savoury meats which is what makes the sandwich delectable.   I was actually really surprised at how well the bread stood up to the sauce and all the filling. It was a bit messy but it didn't fall apart in my hands which is quite impressive. And the onion crisps stayed crispy giving the sandwich a nice crunch as you bite into it.   This is a fast food location where you make your order at the counter, and then wait until your number is called so that you can customize your sandwich. There is a decent amount of seating if you'd like to eat in. The guys at the counter was patient and explained the difference between the different sandwiches and also made good recommendations regarding toppings and cheese choices. I went with his recommendations and my sandwich was delicious. I would definitely recommend to drop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is simply the best cheesesteak sandwich I had in years! First time in this restaurant, all the staff and the owner were soooo warm and welcoming. They gave us recommendations on how to choose the toppings and cheese, and I ordered a crazy buffalo wings poutine.  This place is far more better than most sandwich places in dt Toronto. Good restaurant like this needs to be known by more ppl! I couldn't help finishing the sandwich once I got into the car. And the regular poutine size is very big too! Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian poutine is the best in town and the young lady behind the counter is super friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"Being in Canada and wanting to try poutine this was a very convenient option.  Philthy was mentioned more than once to me. Of course we know the authentic poutine originated in Quebec and I was no where near.   The establishment is located on Yonge along with a plethora of other food places. This particular building had three eating establishments inside. Philthy is at the end and there is elevated seating for dining in. The layout is more cafeteria style I would say but that certainly does not take away from the food.   The cheesesteak poutine order was quite filling on its own. Since I got to chance to eat it fresh everything tasted as great as can be.  It consisted of Philly cheesesteak, cheese wiz, sautéed onions, real cheese curds and their signature gravy.   Food is ordered at the register then you mosey you way along the line to the right to where they freshly prepare each order. The employee that assisted me was very polite and helped to answer some questions as it was my first time visiting the establishment.   There is a good amount of foot traffic and this seems to be a popular local spot. I was able to find a seat and enjoy the food.   The menu options certainly have some tempting, delicious and high calorie offerings with something to please any picky eater. Great place for locals. And even more tempting for out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Moku* was super helpful and the food did not disappoint! We will definitely be back. Make sure you get cheese whiz on everything!"}
