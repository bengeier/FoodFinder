{"text":"Hot n' Fast Chinese Kitchen is an unassuming little takeout and delivery kitchen, that indeed fulfills the claim of their name.  The food is hot and fast, and moreover, delicious! My dinner for one, which was more than enough grub for me and my lady, was ready for pickup a mere 20 minutes after placing the order.  The dinner, which consisted of a spring roll, wonton soup, mixed vegetables, chicken fried rice, and one entree, cost only $10.75 + tax.  I selected Ginger Chicken, and it was a nice mix of spicy and sweet, and went well with the fried rice.  The best part is that none of it was greasy.   So, if you're stuck for dinner and you want great, affordable Chinese food fast, why not try Hot n' Fast Chinese Kitchen."}
{"text":"Good food, super fast, we like it.  Friendly service.  We have ordered take out from Hot'n'Fast dozens of times, and have never been disappointed.  Sure it's not fancy, nor is any of the food a Culinary masterpiece - but it is all very good Chinese take-out.  For this style of food, I have not found anywhere better.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese food restaurant we order from now, and have been for over ten years. I've eaten more than my weight in Chinese food from dozens of different places over the years and this is tops on my list. If you are within 30 minutes of here, you have to try it. There are other places that have their signature dish, but Hot n Fast is by far the overall best menu wide.  Most times I order from home with my car keys in hand because the food is ready so quickly. By the time I hang up and drive straight there, my food is ready and waiting.  We have had people come from out of province request it. They even remember the name, just so they know they are getting the same food as last time.  Note that they are take out and delivery only."}
{"text":"This is now our favourite Chinese food takeout place. They are open till nice and late which is great if you work till late in the evening.  Reasonable prices.  4 star ginger beef. I love beef with broccoli extra beef. Mmmm so good. Friendly staff. Lemon chicken wasn't the best. But the rest is great!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is an American bad version of Chinese cooking. Their food is tasty and will fill your stomach but not true Chinese cooking. For example when you order a seafood dish such as cashew nut prawns, you expect to see nice decent size prawns with cashews, not bay shrimp with a pound of celery and other veggies to fill the take out container.  I typically don't eat Chinese food here in Calgary and usually wait until I go back home to San Francisco especially when a Chinese rest. Owner told me to go to Chinatown to get what I want because white people don't order that! These were her exact words, folks."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area. Didn't feel like cooking one night so we found this place. We had our food delivered. I'm impressed at how fast they were to get here. The food was hot and delicious. The delivery guy was smiling and friendly. This is our favorite place now to order Chinese food. I recommend Hot and Fast Chinese Kitchen. And there were no leftovers...awesome!!"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap and nothing to go back to.   Decent sized dinner portion and it's open late but for cheap Chinese food it's like a food court"}
