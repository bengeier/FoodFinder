{"text":"Love this family owned restaurant! Maria is always so welcoming. Food is always excellent! Never disappoints me. Nice & cozy =)"}
{"text":"Went here a while back. Waited 45 minutes to get starter salad. Plate was not cleared 1.5 hours after sitting down - still without mains. Told waiter we wanted bill. He told us our food was coming. We wanted out and refused it. To his credit he brought the food in take out containers and told us mean had been \"comped\".

Service was terrible - food did not live up to hype. I know italian and there are many many better in the GTA."}
{"text":"Its not the fanciest looking place but its quiet and the food is always enjoyable. Stay away from the wine. Its nothing special. But food is great. Great place to take a date of you want home Italian cooking and a quiet unimposing atmosphere. Plus maria is awesome"}
{"text":"Yeah the decor is a little dated, yeah the service is a bit slow, but that's the style and charm of this place. Waiter is polite and well dressed, mama Maria is super friendly and loves to get to know her customers and the whole place has a home dinner feel. Just order a wine and kick back and relax, this is no-rush dining.

Food:
Very clean and healthy tasting! Pasta is excellent, tomato sauce is delicious and fresh tasting. Very authentic Italian home cooking. I love the lamb pasta and fazoletti. Mussels with sauce for dipping bread is awesome and Maria likes to bring you extra bread so as not to waste the delicious sauce. 

I don't get to eat in that location often, too out of the way so once in a while I go back. Easily the best Italian place in richmond hill."}
{"text":"Maria oh Maria.  Amazing personality shines through from her Italian background and welcoming gestures.  She instantly adopted us into her Family while she served us every step of the way as her wait staff was MIA.  Solo Maria also prides herself on HEALTHY ingredients in preparation of the Meal.

She is such a fun speak-her-mind type of Italian Mama which makes me feel comfortable in her presense.  The decor is nothing in comparison to the Italian multi-million invested Fine Dining Restaurants but is Fine enough for that occasion.  

The service is a bit slow(aka Leisurely) like how you expect from entertaining guest at home and the music has to be switched on as Maria forgot to put it on repeat.  

Tip: Make sure your Friend is entertaining!  Especially when Maria heads to the Kitchen, anyone will seem SHY in comparison.  Glad I had a Hyperactive Friend with me.   :P

Bruschetta($4.50) - I don't understand this as it can be made to better standards simply by using Baquette that was offered afterwards along with our Mains.

Fish of the Day($22.00) - Sea Bass Fillet misses on the lighlty crispiness of the floured pan-fried Fillet.  The Fillet however wasn't overcooked which is probably my preference over the crispy coating.

Fazzoletti alla Maria ($18.50) - This Stuffed Pasta with Ground Veal was simply perfectly done and I appreciate the Fresh Pasta quite a bit and makes me wanting for MORE Pasta next time around.  The Ground Veal mixed with the Tomato Sauce is excellent.  Fan'd

I'm glad that Maria has quite a bit of Pasta on her Simple, Fresh Home style Italian Menu.  It's quite Family style at least what we had, so Maria doesn't mind you sharing with one another.  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place got 3 stars. Horrible horrible horrible food (yes I need to say it three times). It's extremely bland, not to mention \"mama\" is very crazy. Avoid at all costs. You're better off going to the little caesars in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Recommended by my foodie friend & man I wasn't disappointed. Food is great.  All dishes were fresh and hot. We order calamari as starter and it was great!!!!"}
{"text":"So it is how it feels like when you have an Italian Mama and you go home for that special dinner?? 

Solo Maria Ristorante does makes me feel like home. Especially when we were there on an afternoon when we were there only one there and with no wait staffs.. Maria becomes our Chef and Servers and our mother. 

There are no lunch special menus...so you ended up have to order off the dinner menu.. We took Maria's suggestions since we could not really agreed on what to order 

Bruschetta ($4.50) 
- Not really impressed.. really some lightly toasted garlic bread with a little little tomato on top. 
- Not enough flavours and not even garnishes.. need a lot more in order more tasty... 

Fazzoletti alla Maria ($18.50) 
- Stuffed Pasta with ground Veal Medallions 
- this is quite good... tons of veal flavoured with fresh herbs... 
- pasta is thin and freshly made... 
- love the tomato sauce.. light with tons of tomatoes and finished off with a 2% milk based cream sauce 

Fish of the Day ($22) 
- Sea bass fillet breaded and grilled seasoned with herbs (rosemary and thyme) finished off with a light touch of balsamic vinegar and olive oil 
- not bad ... but I have better... the fish is not flaky enough to my liking, especially I expect a lot from Sea brass.. 

Free appetizer of deep fried smelts.. nice of Maria.. I could not break her heart saying I don't eat smelts much as I found it too fishy :P.  

Prices wise Solo Maria is comparatively more pricey.. it may worth it if you willing to pay for Organic Chicken and better ingredients.

So if you looking for some Authentic Home Cooking.. come to Solo Maria.. but if you want a fine dining services you will definitely be disappointed. Maria is loud as Italian you can get... but have a big warm heart! 

Now this is another place that will make me feel warm and fuzzy and feel just like home!"}
{"text":"Going to Solo Maria was like going back in time to my Nonna's home, the smell and taste of the food from appetizer to main was unbelievable, I have been to many italian restaurants all over North America, but nothing comes close to the food we had at Solo Maria. The attention to detail is amazing, even the bread was made from scratch by Maria. Maria herself not only is the chef but entertains you with her wonderful culinary stories. I felt the love and passion Maria has to cook and entertain for people."}
