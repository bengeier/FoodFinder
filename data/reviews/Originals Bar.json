{"text":"Had my big Birthday party here last weekend - 25 friends - Originals and their staff, particularly manager Tanya and cute server Chelsea - were great. They gave us our own private section and even threw in a few freebies because of the size of our group.  They were so patient with us, even when we changed sections.  Tanya confirmed our platter orders before the big day.  The band they had for my party was great - Ascencion Groove, R&B - lots of fun and very professional.  Rail drinks were only $4 and beers were relatively inexpensive too.  Booths are very comfy there.   Would certainly recommend Originals !"}
{"text":"When I used to live in the neighbourhood, I used to avoid this place. I still do.  Other than the occasionally decent live band, I can't say I've ever liked it.   The food is only OK. I found the staff REALLY rude, and I know, I got ripped off more than once on a bar tab there (for example, one time, I got charged for at least twice the amount of beers I actually had... I even said to the manager that \"If I had actually had that many, you'd be calling me an ambulance, and taking me to Sunnybrook\".  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"OG's has gone way downhill lately. It used to be a cool place with live bands and a games room for the kids. They have since split the bar in half (the other half is now a hair salon), and it is no longer fun. A bunch of strange regulars hang around the bar, getting over served and playing electronic darts.   Staff are very friendly, and the bar often hires local kids as servers."}
{"text":"Last went to this place in 2006. It was fun, food was good. Cool up stairs arcade type area for kids. Now it's being run down. Faucets in bathroom are cheap replacements, upstairs arcade had someone's old food sitting in it, \"award\" candies sitting open. Food was passable. Better choices only a few doors down."}
{"text":"Maybe I got lucky .. cause I'm looking at the previous reviews and I thought otherwise.  So I had an office lunch here and we got here around 1:15pm. I ordered the Nicoise Salad with avocado on the side. It was freaking delicious!! The salmon was perfect and I loved the crunch of the argula with the contrast of the boiled egg.   I loved it! My coworker got the Chipotle Wrap and he said it was good. I don't usually order salads when I go out, but I did this time and I'm so glad! I  Service was attentive and my meal was under $20. I do wish they didn't charge $1.50 for 1/4 of an avocado though.. which is a rip-off.  Otherwise, it was good. I would order the Nicoise Salad again and probably will return."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have ever had downtown.   The food was alright but nothing fancy. I had to go up to the wait staff who were chatting to make my order as well as to get my bill which I had already asked for twice.    I saw the manager apologize to 2 different people while I was there so I don't think I was the only who was not having a good experience.   There are much better places, I recommend any of them."}
{"text":"John P. Presti-I went to Originals on both Saturday and Sunday, and I might add that the service was good from all, but in particular from Vanessa, Megan, and Christina and I focus on what the establishment brings to the community which is professionlism.  John P. Presti. 6:10pm October 16th 2016."}
{"text":"After passing Originals a few times, and getting the impression that this spot was a bit out of place in the Leaside location, I wondered what it was like on the inside.   My usual take to a road house type of joint is the food is going to be meh. Honestly, the food wasn't too bad. I had the chicken soulvaki wrap with Greek salad. The veggies were fresh in both the salad and the wrap. The dressing was a bit too lemony for my liking, but was fresh tasting all around. The chicken was okay, and I would have liked more tzatziki, but again, I realize this is a road house/bar, not Athens, or even the Danforth   Overall, the menu is mostly app's (chicken fingers, french onion soup, nachos), pizza, chicken parm, burgers, some large salads, and pasta.   Originals has 2 floors, and the kitchen (surprisingly) was upstairs! I felt bad for the waiter bringing the food down to our table. Our orders did get a bit messed up, but it was just before the USA vs England FIFA game, so totally not a big deal.   The washrooms have super narrow stalls, but are very clean. They do have this vending machine outside of the washrooms that carries everything from condoms, to Tylenol, to Listerine strips.   There is a kids play room upstairs, a party room you can book, live bands, and karaoke on Tues nights.   Great spot to watch a game (before the soccer started, there was golf, baseball and car racing all playing on different tv's) and grab a drink. The bar on the main floor kind of reminded me of the tv show Cheers. Only thing missing was a snarly Carla and a Norm."}
{"text":"I'd give the place a solid 3 stars, FOR a pub. That means that it's neither outstanding, but also not a shithole. Pardon my language.  Came here with a few friends, who are regulars, and got exactly what I expected. Considering most of the clientele is probably from the area, and it's not catering to a high-end crowd, it's actually pretty clean, and service isn't bad.  Had some light snacks. Food 7/10 (don't order fancy...it's a pub...) Beer is beer. Tried some odd english beer my bud was recommended... tasted like water. Lesson = order what you know.  Overall, feel isn't bad. Can be a little loud, but much better than some of the crap you find north of the area."}
{"text":"Our server wasn't as attentive as she should have been.  Pizza was good.   Nachos weren't very good, they were covered in way too much sour cream and toppings which made everything a gooey mess.   But the beer was cold and the company I was with was great."}
{"text":"Originals Bar is your basic bar with pub food, I don't see what really sets them apart from other bars. The pub food is pretty standard. My Volleyball Team ended up here as it was the yearly season ending pub night, and they always have it at Originals. Nothing really special about Originals. It's like any other bar. One thing I do like about this place is that they have a second floor that's a nice secluded place to get away from the noisy bar downstairs. We had our big volleyball group reserve the 2nd floor for our league. Food is decent and Drinks prices are ok as well. I would come back with the league, but wouldn't specifically make the trip here on my own. They have to attract people somehow. Just haven't seen for myself how they do that. JimStar Out!"}
{"text":"This place is actually terrible.   The food was terrible and much too expensive, the servers were rude and the decore is just generally shabby and unclean.  The only saving grace was a live performance by a musician, Greg Wired, that I particularily like.   I will definitely never go back."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Service not great. Foul smell downstairs in washroom area. Overall, a disgusting experience and will never return."}
