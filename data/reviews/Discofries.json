{"text":"This place gets a star because the people were nice, place was clean, and the food (what we ate) wasn't bad and yes I know you can't get lower than one star..... there is barely any seating (8 stools-6 on the 1 wall and 2 by the window, and 1 table. We got there when it was empty but it was quickly packed and we could barely get out of the booth.... didn't help people where basically trying it take it while we were just standing), black things floating in the Sprite..... the guy that was coming from the kitchen said it was something from the water filter (think like right when you change a Brita filter).... okay but still it shouldn't be there. To top it off there was hair in my friend's food (wrong color, length and texture to be any of ours). Sorry black floaters and hairy food are deal breakers for me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Ignore the bad reviews. I went at 3am and the service was fast, employees were nice, and most importantly the food is AMAZING. Definitely going to this place regularly. Thanks for a good experience."}
{"text":"This place isn't half bad! It's pretty fun to have a joint that specializes in fry dishes. My friends and I tried a bunch of specialty ones. 

I think the gyro fries were my favorite! I just wish it came with much more sauce than my plate had. The chili fries were my least favorite, simply because I didn't really like the chili's flavor much. It tasted like meat sauce more than anything. The breakfast fries were pretty straight forward, like a scrambler, but tasted like it sounds.

All in all, I wish the fry dishes had more sauces/toppings in general, or just a less fry to topping ratio. I didn't really get to try fries on their own, but they looked hand cut and fresh, so I'd hope they can be trusted for that reputation!"}
{"text":"As a fry fiend, I have to say that the fries here are just OK, although perhaps another visit coudl bump them up to four stars. The eponymous disco fries feature cotija cheese, beef brisket, and green onions. Overall it sounds really great but the flavors mush together into too much saltiness, even for fries.  My order did come up very quickly (place was nearly empty when I was there on a weekday lunch) and the fries were freshly made, which is a plus. Overall the location is very tiny despite that that the fries, even with the fork and takeout container, are not super conducive to walking and eating.  I love fries but I'm not particularly inspired to go back--it could be that they have a different fry combo that's better balanced."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a slightly divey vibe. It used to be a dentist office so there is an odd display window well in the front. It was a good experience until I ordered the classic poutine with bacon...what I got were plain fries with bacon, which I didn't check until we were driving away. Fries were fine but do people really want fries with little bacon bits? I guess some might. Overall, I would probably go back to try the poutine, for real this time."}
