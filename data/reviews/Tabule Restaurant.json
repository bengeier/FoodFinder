Hummus is a must. Love the tea as well!"}
{"text":"What makes for a great neighbourhood restaurant? There are certain essential qualities that it must have: a friendly, knowledgeable staff, a charming host, great atmosphere and above all, fantastic food. Tabülé is unquestionably one of these restaurants. Serving amazing Middle Eastern cuisine, Tabülé is a midtown spot not to be missed.

Tabülé offers fresh, intensely flavoured dishes from start to finish. Over several visits, I have had the pleasure of trying about half the menu and have yet to come across a dish that wasn't utterly delectable. Normally not a big fan of eggplant, I make exceptions here for the babaganüj, a gorgeous pureéd eggplant dip mixed with tahini, garlic and lemon juice. Additionally, the fried eggplant has great char on it and is finished with a lemon & garlic dressing that adds a bright note to the soft, creamy, rich starter. Not to be overlooked are the fresh, pungent tabülé and the labni which is a yogurt cheese mixed with a healthy dose of garlic and topped with zaatar. Finally, the hot cauliflower appetizer was recommended by the host who did not steer us in the wrong direction. Finished with Lebanese tahini, there were polite fights over who would get the last morsel.

Once you have gorged yourself on the hot and cold mezze (starters), it is time to move on the main event. There is always a fresh fish of the day, topped with the bright house lemon and garlic dressing. The grilled mains all come with heaping portions of rice with crispy onions for texture as well as grilled peppers, onions and zucchini. The kefta is certainly a popular option and a tasty one at that. Consider them Lebanese meatballs, made with a mix of ground lamb and beef, tomatoes, onions, parsley, garlic and lemon juice. Always perfectly cooked, they are steaming hot upon arrival at the table, a little bit pink inside. Also fabulous is the charcoal-broiled shrimp that have been marinated in Middle Eastern spices. Spicy and succulent, they are even slightly better with the squeeze of lemon that accompanies this particular dish. You will not want to share them with your dining companions.

While you are thoroughly enjoying your food, take some time to look around and drink in the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is cozy without feeling claustrophobic and the dining room is host to just about every demographic in Toronto. You will see couples on dates, families, birthday celebrations, even bachelorette parties. On Saturday night, people wait patiently at the bar for a table and are entertained by the belly dancing show at 9pm. Though a little calmer during lunch, Tabülé certainly does not lack atmosphere. Upon return visits, you will notice that you see the same wait staff over and over again - a good sign in a turbulent industry. Hospitality is the name of the game here, and it is done expertly.

Should you have room for dessert (and if you don't, just loosen your belt a little. It's worth it), check out the künafa ashta. Lebanese custard is topped with super fine shreds of phyllo pastry, pistachios and rose water syrup. Light and not overly sweet, this dish is a superb way to end a meal and is a paradigm of why Tabülé's menu is so successful: it combines many elements in a balanced, seamless dish. It is at once creamy, crunchy, a bit tart, a bit sweet and is highly aromatic.

Like the final course of the evening, all the dishes at Tabülé balance flavor and texture and, because of this, the food is elevated beyond the ingredients. Pop in for a meal, or have one delivered to you: either way, you enjoy a hearty, mouth-watering meal that will have you coming back for more."}
{"text":"We had a good experience here although I wasn't wowed anything and have definitely had better middle eastern.  

We had falafel out appetizer and kefta and tawuk skewers for our mains. I definitely agree that we could have shared just one of these mains and we both would have been stuffed.  The food was ok, but I definitely wouldn't write home about it.  As someone who cooks at home a lot, I'd definitely say my own tawuk and kefta kabobs are better.

The service was friendly but was a little slow."}
{"text":"Our Summerlicious experience at Tabule was tasty and fun - from the water jug to the hanging lamp and quaint teapot, it was all a delightful experience.

The appetizer - a combination platter of humus, babaganuj, tabule and falafel served with chewy flatbread (I love it!) - was a meal in itself. The falafel was delicious.  The main courses: skewered chicken breast was tender and moist but the skewered ground beef and lamb was disappointing - on the dry side, may be overcooked.  But the dessert saved the day!  The Knaffa Ashta, angel hair filo topped with custard and topped off with rosewater syrup was melt in your mouth heavenly! 
Great ambiance and attentive service.  It was an enjoyable evening.

{"text":"Went their for Winterlicious this year and was very happy. The ambiance is perfect for a relaxed evening with friends with some amazing food thrown in. The customer service was the best I have received in a long while! Despite being really busy, the server offered to help us with our coats, and the lady serving us was so funny and friendly! Good food is a given, but excellent service really makes your trip worthwhile. Their lentil soup is very good- a little heavy so don't order it with a huge meal unless you are absolutely ravenous. The veggies were grilled to perfection and the falafel and baklava was good too. We'll surely go their again. Remember to do a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"The food was great!!! Lamb chops were incredible and all the appetizers. However the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the main reason we went was for the chicken tawuk and it was rather small pieces and very dry. Of course the greatest garlic sauce made up for it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Tabule many times in the past few years and I am usually always satifisfied.

The restaurant does get quite busy on weekends, so if you don't have a reservation,  you may need to wait a bit.  

Standout dishes for me are:

The Hummus is quite good and filling
The Halum Salad 
The Lamb Keftta.

They have a decent wine list.

Service is pretty good as well most times I've been."}
{"text":"Used to be a fan. Now not so much. Servers turn over way too fast now. Service inconsistent and some of the new staff way too timid to make it a relaxed environment. I've been here at least 40 times and it's not quite the same anymore."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Super greasy dishes yet blend. Even Tabule  was not good. There was an insect in my salad; they did not wash the lutes properly. They were not generous with parsley and olive on Humus. Bread was not fresh. Overall, I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm giving them one star because they are cheap. The food is amazing and I go there very often and order from there too. Today I ordered food for $60 and got two pita breads, how am I supposed to eat 1 large hummus and 1 large babaghanoug?????

I'm mean come on its flour mixed with water how hard would it be to be more generous with the bread."}
{"text":"Love this place! The ambiance is wonderful and service and of course delicious food! One of my favorite places for falafel."}
{"text":"Would I eat at Tabule again?  Yes.  However, we were completely ignored by the wait-staff who kept walking past us to serve all the other people who arrived after we did (and left before us)!  Although they kept apologizing for forgetting about us, it did have an effect on our experience there and the tip!

I had mint tea, lentil soup and shared labni (it was quite good), hummus, tabule and one of the salads.  It was all refreshing and light, though I think I will have to return to try some of the meat.

The belly dancer came out at 9 pm and between her and the wait-staff squeezing past our table and brushing against us (as did her scarf while she was twirling), I will admit it was a bit distracting.  Lucky for them I find the humour in things and laughed about everything.  Except for when it took them 30 minutes to bring us the very tasty sorbet for dessert.

All in all, I would go back but next time I may not have 2 hours to eat, so hopefully I will have a more positive experience.

February 2011 - Ok, so I went back and had a much better experience!  The hummus was extra lemony - delicious!"}
{"text":"Came on very busy Saturday for lunch...And it happened to be summerlicious which was a bonus... The food was great, the amount of food was plentiful and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I like this spot.  It is pricey and the portions are not huge but the food is really good.

I would recommend if you are in the area and craving some Middle Easter/Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"If you love middle eastern food you will love Tabule. The cauliflower is a must order. To quote my brother: \"I never thought I would be excited to eat cauliflower but this is really good.\" My favourite main course is the lamb skewer with the mujaddara rice. If you are sharing, the salmon skewer dinner is a good second choice as well. Don't be afraid to over order, I do it all the time so I'll have extra to take home."}
{"text":"Very good food and a nice atmosphere. The portions are huge and I invariably go home with a doggie bag. My only complaint is that the menu is a bit limited"}
{"text":"Atmosphere/Decor = Cozy 

Food = Pretty good

Service = Not impressive. Server seemed frazzled. 

Price = Medium"}
{"text":"Nothing terribly special... Chicken was dry and falafels tiny. Atmosphere is hectic and service scattered. Considering the high prices I won't go back."}
{"text":"I came here with a group for a birthday lunch and everyone was really happy with their meal. I had the falafel fattush which was just packed full of flavour - delicious. We loved the fun way they poured water too. Well worth a visit and I'm definitely going to return."}
{"text":"First off, I've never been in the restaurant and have only done delivery. Someone in my building had ordered this and I smelled the food as the delivery guy passed by. I'm very familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine, so I asked for a menu and tried them out.

The food has been great every time. It's Middle Eastern done well. The Fried Eggplant is greasy but delectable and the Babaganuj was also quite impressive. The falafels are not the best I've ever had (that distinction goes to the stand that used to be in What A Bagel on Bathurst south of Wilson 3 years ago, but I digress) but they are very tasty. The Warak Enab and Mujaddara are middle of the road dishes but great as sides from time to time. The Kefta however is top notch and can't be missed.

I found the prices to be elevated by about 20% compared to what I'd want to pay. This keeps me from ordering more often. The two most recent times, my tallies have been about $50 and $65 for two people. They also have a very heft delivery charge of $7.50 outside of the inner radius.

Having not visited the property yet, I have not been subject to slow or sub-par service. Therefore, I am compelled to recommend that you try this joint at least once, even by ordering delivery if you must."}
{"text":"Tried the summerlicious menu there. Well, ah, okay! i must say. No complaints though. Its definitely good but not the best out there. 
But my husband chose not to try the summerlicious(!?!?!? lol) and ordered from the regular menu. He tried the lebanese coffee and fell in love with it immediately. And again not my favorite
All five fingers not the same rite ?"}
{"text":"Some great vegetarian and vegan options, love their flash fried cauliflower their and their lentil soup is fantastic. Make sure to try their garlic tomatoes. Their food is always very fresh."}
{"text":"This place feels like you walked into someone's Lebanese dinner table. Wonderful atmosphere and great service meet delicious middle eastern food.

I recommend sharing a combination of a few warm and cold appetizers to get started. Their baba is great as is the labnah, Kube, humus and falafel. The pita was good and they have a choice of whole wheat or white pita. Then if you have any room left (and it's  challenge trust me) sharing a main course is no problem you will be happily full. I've had both the chicken and lamb and they were both delicious especially with some pita and humous. 

My favourite part is the no corkage fee during the week."}
{"text":"Try the Labni with some warm pita, it's delicious. The lamb kebab are tender and nicely seasoned. The delivery in the area is convenient."}
{"text":"Good food, good sevice. We wish they would use linen instead of that cafeteria style."}
{"text":"I have been going to Tabulé for years and before to its cousin Jerusalem.

The service is good, food quality excellent, and Lebanese tastes very authentic!

Large seating area and nice patio too."}
{"text":"Interesting concept to have middle Eastern foods. Their service is fast and the foods are good but in a small portion. Tgeir winterlicious and summerlicious menus are not bad too."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my visit to Tabule perhaps because reading the reviews i expected excellent middle eastern food. Although the appetizer sampler was very good, my experience came to a screeching halt there. I ordered the eggplant entree and it presented very nicely, but it lacked taste. The waitress was way too busy to be attentive and waiting became the occupation of the evening. Ive been a fan of lebanese food for over 30 years but have never tried lebanese coffee before.  So, i ordered one to finish my stay and was soooo disappointed.  It tasted close to what i imagine boiled potpourri to taste. Id go back to give this place another try just because it had so many other entrees that i can try. The star of the evening was the tahini , placed over anything it would make the most blandest dish come alive. Unfortunately, there wasnt enough on my eggplant to revive it.
We tipped our waitress generously because when she was able to get to our table, she was warm,friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Not so great. Dirty glasses and plates. Some of the food was really well done, but super slow service detracted from the whole experience."}
{"text":"We have been there for the first time to try their winterlicious lunch menu and it was amazing. Great and fast service, excellent food, definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Great service that was quick and attentive. 
Food was tasty and fresh. Loved the  Tabülè, the Hallüm Salad and the Lamb Skewers."}
{"text":"Today I went for their summerlicious meal and almost died, and I mean that quite literally. There was a sharp metal object in my red bell pepper which I almost swallowed, absolutely disgusting. Couldn't even finish my meal after that. They apologized - but very insincerely, there was a lack of genuine concern.  I only got the vegetable kebab lunch because they had run out of chicken, my vegetables were also quite charred. The restaurant also seemed unhygienic, there was food on the floor, the glasses were dirty and they give tissue papers instead of napkins. 

I never write reviews on here, but in this circumstance it's imperative that I do because nobody wants to die a death-by-kebab-death. Needless to say, I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Recommend their lamb dishes! Better than Paramount. Food is authentic and flavourful. Make reservations"}
{"text":"I really wish I could rate 3.5 stars because this restaurant is solidly between an A-OK and a Yay, I'm a fan.

So what did I have...

Lentil Soup: It's was ai'ight. The flavour was good, the soup itself was watered down. Not sure how the flavour managed to show up with all the watering down, but it did nonetheless and that's why it was just ai'ight.

Falafel Salad: This is pretty good. It's fresh, lemony (if you don't like lemons, you won't like this so much), and the falafels are nice and crunchy. I always have this dish wishing there were more falafels rolling around on the plate. 

The upside to this resto is that they deliver locally which can be convenient. The downside is that your delivery bill comes to some ridiculous number in the high-50's to low-60's for a meal for two people. For delivery, that's pretty pricey. 

Like I said, a solid 3.5 sitting between A-OK and Yay. 

Happy munching!"}
{"text":"Nice vegetarian options. Our experience with service was good - attentive, but not too much so, and everything arrived when we wanted it. Watch out for eyes-bigger-than-stomach - portion sizes are good enough that it's easy to end up with too much.

Falafels were a tad over-cooked. And why no beer on tap?

Overall, a happy experience - will go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner at Tabule. Food was very tasty and portioned and priced well. Service was good and there was a nice crowd of young and older customers. We will return to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing service. And super delicious food! I was very shocked at how delicious this place is. I got the lamb chop dinner as well as two lamb skewers and one other skewer that I forgot the name to. Our waitress, Sarah is very professional and really knows her food recommendations. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food the lamb is always cooked perfectly and the dips and tabule salad are as good as it gets. Service is consistent and professional."}
{"text":"tabule.  a bit of a trek to get to if you're downtown and to be honest: not worth my TTC coins.  first off, the service is very slow and  i waited at least 20 for my apps, another 35-40 for my fish and when i finally got my drink, it was very weak.  the worst part is that i also happened to dine when the belly dancer was in.  omg is it kitschy in the Worst - with a capital W - way, and it made me feel embarrassed to eat.  no thanks.  i love me some lebanese food, but i'll get my falafel and bb ganoush at ghazale.

to be fair, i'll be honest and say that the apps were pretty good; i really liked the lentil soup and the shared combo plate."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and Tabule is one of my faves. Good, healthy food simply prepared. Lots of it and very good value. Good fast service and, if you go on bellydancing night, a lot of fun."}
{"text":"LOVED it!

I've seen it for years on Yonge Street heading downtown and always wondered about it. But because its in the middle of Eglinton and Davisville on Yonge its not exactly somewhere I would find myself going out to dinner. However, when I was planning a Summerlicious dinner out with friends who only ate halal meat I thought this would be the perfect time to try this Middle Eastern restaurant.

The PLUSES

1. Food:
- great big portions (even for the Summerlicious menu)
- for Summerlicious specifically - a great selection on the menu
- excellent meals from appetizers, entrees to dessert

2. Entertainment value
- The water-pouring performance - it's a show! We found ourselves stopping our conversations watching the water being poured and just because of that if nothing else one can be assured that you'll walk out of there hydrated! 
- There is a belly dancer but we didn't see her when we were there

3. Patio
- great patio - its not on the most crowded part of yonge street and it has a good amount of space 

4. Service
- It's not exceptional by any means but the staff is friendly.
- We did have to wait to be served - they did forget about us initially when we were seated on the patio and there was a confusion of who our server was: there was the greeter at the front door, the hostess who walked you to your seat, the water performer were all warm up acts leading to the server who was around 20 minutes late

5. Halal
- its was so great to find a nice looking place at a great locations that served halal food. But be aware that only their meat is halal and not the chicken. It doesn't make sense to me but that's what they say!

Appetizers: I had the grilled eggplant which was tossed in lemon - delic! And the rest of table had the sampler plate with a great tabule (not over done with parsley), mini falafels and baba ganoush or hummus - I can't remember. The platter was great as well.

Entrees: We ordered the lamb dishes which were phenomenal. I am not a red meat eater but have been told I need to add it to my diet. So I decided to make this meal my first go at lamb and I think may just be a convert now. The aromas in the dish and the flavours in the gravy were divine. Each entrée comes with rice and grilled vegetables which are really great as well.

Dessert: the orange/ raspberry sherbet ice cream was the best I have ever had!! It was incredible - so glad I picked this over the baklava plate. I had never tasted anything like it! 

Have been there once again since Summerlicious and would love to back!"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, and great food. 

I had eaten at the Tabule on Queen St. and was curious how this location would compare. The service was fantastic. Our server was very knowledgeable and timely. The food was delicious, especially the hummus. The hummus is made with fresh ingredients and boy does it show. The only thing I would say is that the kefta was a little dry. Otherwise the meal was delicious. 

Definitely recommend and I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"Being an Arab and a foodie, I judge restaurants that serve my own people's cuisine a bit more harshly than other types.  Plus, my mom is a phenom in the kitchen.  Needless to say, I grew up spoiled...and fat.  But I digress...

Tabule is awesome.  First of all, I recommend making reservations. It's definitely a popular restaurant and it's a bit small on the inside (typical for Yonge St).  

The decor is nice- the lighting is dim, Moroccan lanterns cast shapes and designs on the walls, it feels authentic without being cheesy. It's a fine line...

We started with fried cauliflower, baba ghanouj, stewed tomatoes, falafel and olives.  The fried cauliflower was amazing. It was well seasoned, fried so quickly that it wasn't mushy and drizzled with a tahini sauce that nicely complements the flavors. The stewed tomatoes were garlicky with a bit of a kick. The falafel and baba ghanouj, while old favorites, tasted like my mom's. The bread was served warm.

We ordered the grilled shrimp entree, pan fried sea bass and the roasted vegetable meal.  The shrimp were grilled nicely- not overcooked, and marinated in a dry rub.  I asked for fattoush in place of the rice, which was great.  My husband loved the sea bass. Often times restaurants season the hell out of fish, but the sea bass was definitely the main show here.  The veggie meal was served with mujaddara- a delightful lentil and rice pilaf. 

Not sure how people are giving this place 3 stars, because it was a solid meal.  If you have a hankering for some crunchy falafel or creamy hummus, definitely visit Tabule."}
{"text":"Meh, Iv Experienced better truly describes my experience at Tabule. Saw this place in the morning newspaper and heard great things from co workers. However it was absolutely nothing special, the servers seemed a little snobbish and the food seemed sort of bland compared to other middle eastern restaurants. Bamiyan, North etc is a much better choice. The fatoush we ordered was mostly all tomatoes, no greens! NOT a real fattoush salad- so disappointing.

p.s The beef and lamb is halal but chicken isn't and they do serve alcohol"}
{"text":"Tablue is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. This place has great food, great service, a very cozy atmosphere, but not too cozy that you feel that you're conversations are being heard by at least 10 other people at the restaurant. 

The staff is very friendly and willing to recommend their menu favourites as well as the more popular dishes in the restaurant. 

Here's a list of their good menu items:

- Sampler platter: you get 3 options, I usually go with the Tabule, Baba Ghanooj, and Hummus
- Warak Enab (Vine Leaves)
- Falafel
- Cauliflower
- Kubbe

- From the Grill: Lamb plate
- From the Grill: Tawuk plate (Grilled Chicken plate)

the chicken and the lamb are seasoned very well and are cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Tabule has the best middle eastern food in the city...period! The service is good although not always consistent..it really depends on the server. Saturday night's you get treated to a live Belly Dancer. Reservations are a must as they fill up early. The Shish Taouk and Lamb dinners are amazing. You also need to try the Akaawi Cheese, Fattush Salad and Hallum Salad,"}
{"text":"We tried the Summerlicious here. We have group of five. I got Hallüm Salad (baby arugula, onions and seared hallüm cheese tossed together in a pomegranate dressing). Entree i ordered beef kabal and baklava for dessert. All the food are very good! Service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and ordered the lamb and chicken. It was a little on the dry side, hummus was ok, nothing special. Huge complaint is about the seating. Tables are packed way too close together, no privacy and not much space between tables. Very frustrating when you are trying to have a conversation. Waited a while for the bill. Overall ok experience. Restaurant is a little over rated/ pricey. Nice decor/ music though."}
{"text":"We have been to Tabule many times over the years and keep coming back.  Here's why.  The food is delicious, plentiful and well spiced.  They offer a selection of both whole wheat and regular pita.  Dips are delicious.  Service is very friendly and relaxed with a great attitude for accommodating food preferences and allergies.  One of the best reasonably priced Middle Eastern restos in T.O.  We'll be back many times for sure!"}
{"text":"I went to the location on Queen West last night and it was amazing!!!  We had the sampler platter of dips to start and everything was fresh and delicious.  But the best part was my main course - I had the grilled chicken skewers and they were incredible.  It is hard to make grilled chiken breast delicious but they managed it - the meat was moist and perfectly seasoned.  It came with tasty plain rice and some awesome grilled vege.  I couldnt have been happier and I plan on going regularly.  The service was also good but really they could have thrown that food at me and I still would have been happy!  I think you can also bring in your own wine for a corkage fee."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant for Middle Eastern fare in Toronto, so far. My friends and I share a ton of plates and inevitably eat too much because its so delicious. Normally I'm not a fan of falafel but I love theirs.
My favourites are the Akaawi cheese (grilled - delicious, I could eat this forever), lentil soup, Basturma with Labni (Middle Eastern prosciuttio and arugula, how can you go wrong), and the Fattush salad, which is simple and refreshing. 
Service was fine, not astounding, but we have gone on busy nights, so its not a big deal to me."}
{"text":"I've dined at Tabule six times in the past few months.  I loved Middle Eastern cuisine but find their food average.  Acceptable but nothing to rave about.   One exception is the Baba Ganoush which is delicious.  

Although they serve lunch on weekends, you must order off the dinner menu (lunch menu is only served M-F).   

I find the service at Tabule consistently poor.  Today's snotty waitress was no exception.  Had to ask for water, utensils and our check.   Not acceptable.

There are better places in TO."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is amazing! I loved the burnt honey ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"Saturday nights at Tabule are fun and fabulous!
My third dinner at Tabule and it just keeps getting better. It is noisy and energetic and fun - and the belly dancers are gorgeous and put everyone into a festive mood. The food is wonderful and the servings are very generous. So is the ALL service (bartender, hostess, waiter, bus girl). I appreciate it when restaurants have several great selections of wine-by-the-glass and Tabule's selections are great for a red wine drinker. My friend and I shared a starter which was \"select three appetizers / sampler\". The pita is warm fresh and great with the Hummus, Babaganüj and Labni (my new favourite). We had two baskets of pita and I was pretty stuffed. We decided to share a main course - Kefta - and it was a very large serving with rice, fried onions and grilled vegetables. No room for coffee and/or dessert. Next time I will start with a main course and work my way through the entire menu. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really good food, especially the hummus. Enjoyed our entrees and the tea that followed. Service was very relaxed, which was probably good for most people having Saturday lunch 'n' linger but frustrating for us because we were on a schedule. Have been several times and always left satisfied."}
{"text":"Gluten free fans this is a must 
We are alway searching for restaurants that respect the severity of diners that cannot tolerate  gluten 
Everything we ate was fantastic 
Fried onion on the rice is to die for :))))
Service was super fast and polite 
If your around Yonge and St Clair this is a must"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for Summerlicious - had a spy at the regular menu and was quite satisfied enough to return to sample more at some point.

Small place, nice ambience and very friendly and helpful staff. There was a line-up out the door and it was a Tuesday night, so the place must have a good reputation.

The Kubbeh (cracked wheat shell stuffed with ground lamb and beef, onions and pine nuts) was amazing; wasn't crazy about my main (Kefta Kebab - skewers ofspiced mixed ground lamb & beef) which was a little too spicy for my tastes. For dessert the baklava was stellar!

Great cocktail menu too. I think this would be a good place to come on dates."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice. Not bad at all!
Decent middle eastern with pretty nice vibe"}
{"text":"The best middle eastern I've had in the city! Fantastic service and the flavours are out of this world! Servers put on a show with their water vessels- small touches make a difference. Went with a co-workers recommendations and all solid.

Side dishes (Hummus, Labni and tabule)- the labni was fantastic along with the tabule; would order this again
Falafels are hands down the best I've had in the city- order this!
Grilled eggplant had nice flavours pairs with the side dishes
Kefta (lamb and beef meatballs) served with a side of rice and grilled vegetables

Dessert was the Künafa Ashta (filo layered with custard drizzled with rose water syrup)

Only place I'll come back to for some Lebanese food"}
{"text":"The food was decent and the service was good.  It wasn't any special, but I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and friendly service - reasonably priced- if you crave nice middle - eastern north African this is the best you can do north of Queen st"}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff are consistently accommodating and will ensure that you have a great experience. The babaganüj is delicious as are the falafel dishes. It's my go-to place for a quick middle-eastern meal. Usually I dine-in but have stopped by for take-out as well. Call ahead and they'll have it packed to go in no time."}
{"text":"came here for summerlicious. everything was DELICIOUS and our server was really great. 

had the cauliflower for an app, kefta kabob as the main, and pistachio gelato for dessert. 

the cauliflower was the best cauliflower i've ever had. it was roasted perfectly and was served drizzled with a white sauce- similar to a tahini. the kefta kabob was tender and flavourful with a little kick in the end. it was served with the most fragrant long-grain rice ever! the pistachio gelato was amazing because it tasted very fresh and home made, and wasn't overly sweet. 

i would definitely come back here. the portions were HUGE so i got a dinner meal + lunch the next day from a $25 meal! AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Lovely service, tasty food and reasonable prices. What more could you want? Only giving 4 stars because the good was really good but not AMAZING in my opinion."}
{"text":"Our meal was hit and miss.

Babaghanoush starter was excellent.  Smoky, lemony, terrific!

Mains were kefta will rice.  Wife got the standard, I got the kefta in tomatoe sauce.  Both were enjoyable, but neither was anything special.  Slightly dry keftas, and the grilled vegetables were inconsistent (overcooked peppers, undercooked onions).

Serving sizes were very large - neither of us finished our mains.

I would definitely go back, but wouldn't go out of my way.

Oh, one more thing - the yelp map is off by about 4 km.  This place is south of Eglinton, not by York Mills."}
{"text":"Food:  Very Good.  This is the only reason to go here.  However, see the staff section below.

Staff:  Generally not the most competent.  They have gotten my simple, directly off the menu order wrong more than once.  They are however very nice and trying quite hard.

Ambiance:  Nice.

Washrooms:  STEEP staircase -  they are in the basement and I would advise that you skip the second beer if you want to make it down them alive.

Overall:  Delicious food, tinted with the mystery of seeing if what you order will actually be what you get....don't bother complaining (although I am sure that if you did they would do something).  Open yourself to just trying something new.  :)"}
{"text":"Love the lentil soup, fried eggplant and Vegetarian falafel. I will definitely come back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Ok this is the best middle eastern (more Lebanese cuisine) restaurant in Toronto and Montreal.  I've tried many restaurants in Montreal (the highest rated ones) and probably all mid-eastern restaurants in Toronto and none compare.   The meat is always very tender, the lamb is highly recommended.  They offer mennonite farm meat for those looking for a more organic alternative.  The eggplant and stuffed grape leaves are great.  It's best to order a bunch of apps and maybe a main to share with others.  After years of frequenting this restaurant though, they could use some menu additions.  It's also very affordable for what you get."}
{"text":"I really liked my experience at Tabule!

Food was yummy, waiters were friendly and the ambiance was lovely (I would actually dub it as date-worthy! Especially since you can bring your own wine for free on Mondays and Tuesdays. )

For food, I recommend their falafel. They were amazing, served hot with a nice crunch of an exterior. The kefta meat were a little dry, but the vegetables that went with it is seasoned quite nicely. Dessert wise, the mühalabiya and rice pudding had a very similar taste, with the mühalabiya custard being the lighter of the two.

The Arak traditional Lebanese liquor was quite neat! it clouds up when you pour water into it... kind of like a science experiment! It comes in a shot that you distill yourself and tastes like liquorice (anise). A sipper drink that warms you up. 

In terms of atmosphere, the decor, music and the extras (the water jugs and the fancy way they poured it, the decorative tea pots, the freebie pickled vegetables side dish) really added to the experience and evoked the Middle Eastern vibe. The restaurant is a cozy place, seemingly small at first glance, but there is actually more room at the back, in an interesting \"U\" shaped layout. My friend and I were surprised to see people streaming out from nowhere. Apparently there is also a belly dancing show on Saturdays at 9pm.

Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"We've been to Tabule 6 times now for a reason. Love this place. Great service. Nice atmosphere. And they're generous too. Little touches like complimentary pita, a generous middle eastern olive and pickle plate and healthy portions make it clear that quality takes precedence over corner cutting. 

If you're looking for Middle Eastern food that's a clear step above the Shwarma joints littered all over the city, try Tabule. You will not regret it it."}
{"text":"you had me at Tabule.

I am pretty sceptical about restaurants that try to twist the middle eastern quinine with a western atmosphere. But this spot really gave me hope in the questionable matter.

We had three of their appetizers. The courliflour with tahini.(better than you'd think)
The akkawi cheese ( melts in your mouth)
And the haloumi salad (rocca leaves, soft balsamic, and 4 thick slices of haloumi)

For the main meal we substituted our sides of rice with tabouli and fries (giant portions for side dish) I believe 1.5 additional cost but worth it

I had the salmon on skewer: it was different but perhaps not my cup of tea. I just wanted to try something new.

Last but not least. DO NOT leave this place without trying their Kunafa and Turkish tea. Those two items alone are worth the entire visit.


Will be back as many times as I can!"}
{"text":"It was a busy night and felt like we got forgotten about on the patio. Screwed up the order a bit but were nice to relocate us once it got chilly. 

Food was good but if you want unbelievable Middle Eastern try Byblos, it'll rock your world. 

The labni was good, babganoush just okay and everything else just so so. 

Service wasn't the best, long wait and they did apologize for it since they began to notice, we didn't mind too much as we were catching up with out of town friends. Just had to ask for water all the time and for everything little thing. 

A bit disorganized. Will try again hopefully just a one off."}

We wanted to try Tabule for a long time, we finally decided to make a trip on Friday evening. We made a reservation and got it for 9:15 PM.

Food - The hummus was nice. The tabule salad was okay too. We ordered the regular one with bulgur, but waitress punched in the order for gluten free one with quinoa. 
For mains we ordered 1 vegetable entree and 1 tawuk (chicken entree) which we upgraded to have mujaddara as accompaniment instead of regular vermicelli rice which was a good choice.
The vegetables were tad overcooked. They were kind of melting in the mouth; they were probably boiled before being grilled.
In the chicken entree, some pieces were cooked well and some were under-cooked. Seemed like one skewer was grilled well and other was not.
For drinks, we ordered one Kumquat mojito and 1 beer. They didn't have beer on tap, just cans and bottles. So, it was a bummer. The Kumquat mojito was very good.

Service - Service was okay. We waited for a bit despite the reservation while they attended to others without reservation. The waitress botched botched up our order a bit by replacing regular Tabule salad with the gluten free one and she seemed very impatient as well. Probably she was having a bad day or maybe the restaurant was too busy. Didn't help our fine dining experience though.

Location - It is coviniently located on the Yonge street between Eglington and Davisville stations, so a short walk from both.And we sat on the patio so it was great.

Ambience - The ambience is great if you get to sit on the patio.

Tip - They have half portions of all appetizers. They don't advertise it anywhere on the menu, but if you ask they'll server half portions which would allow you to try many different appetizers.

Overall - There are many good Mediterranean restaurants on our list to try in Toronto, before we return. Nothing to rave about. Considering the hype and prices, it should not be very high in your bucket list."}
{"text":"Good food. Very small portions. Slow service. Took forever to get our drinks and food."}
{"text":"Dinner & lunch

Ambience: 3.5/5  
Food: 4/5 
Service: 4/5 (Friendly)
Value: 4/5 
Repeat: Already have. One of my favorites in TO. I've never gotten past the apps, Highly recommend them, portions are generous and Delish."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Tabule!  All of the food was fresh, simply-seasoned, & brightly colored - just like I like it.  

My son ordered the lamb with fries.  He thoroughly enjoyed his meal as noted by the sauce which continually seeped from the corners of his mouth.  He wishes he'd gotten the salad as a side instead of the fries.  I was kind enough to share mine.  

I ordered the salmon lunch special.  The salmon was grilled nicely.  If I had to guess, I'd predict the salad is tossed in fresh lemon, salt, & perhaps a hint of vinegar.  There is something else, which I can't identify, but it's deliciously refreshing."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for an impromptu date night during Winterlicious. I had zero expectations. It was fantastic. All of their dishes were unique and tasty. The servers were helpful and very polite. I would come back again.

My only recommendation is that the salt could be cut down a bit."}
{"text":"it is one of my favorite at yonge and Eg.
food is always fresh, i tried lots of things in the menu but my favorite stays the lentil soup and filet mignon plate"}
{"text":"First came for Babelicious in the spring and enjoyed the food.  Came back for Summerlicious and i again enjoyed the food.  The kofta kebob has a great grilled flavour.  The accompanying salad was fresh and had a great mint flavour.  Too bad their pitas aren't hot and fluffy but the mixed appetizer plate was good as was the lentil soup.  The staff is very friendly and loved entertaining my little one.  I was most impressed to see a nice baby change station in the women's restroom complete with diapers and supplies!  This is wonderful."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is lovely. The food was good. I ordered the salmon entree. It came with vegetables and rice. The salmon was cooked nicely, but it didn't taste spectacular. The rice was delicious. Some people may think it's bland but to me, the rice melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"It was great...service was quick and the waitress was very friendly!! We showed up without reservation and they were quick to seat us...although the store was packed....food was amazing too...vegetarian options to suit all...and the best part was the arak...it reminded me of the real deal... The only thing that wasn't great was the decoration, menu looked horribly designed and the store was packed... But worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Great service and reasonably priced. You will need to make reservations ahead of time. This place is always packed and now I know why.

I had the falafel entree which is vegan and glutenfree."}
{"text":"I have ever been disappointed with Tabule, having had delivered catering for late-night meetings at the office, as well as loungy-type dinners with family and friends.
Always impressed. Catering menu has a good selection, and I usually get a pita (falafel or skewer) for each person, which is loaded with toppings.
Then I order side dishes, such as steamed eggplants, tabuleh, hummous, and babaghanoush. They even provide extra pitas as well (and hot sauce!).
As for the dinners, we were impressed  by the simplicity of the cooked cauliflower with tahini drizzled on top.
The meats are nicely cooked, flavourful, and not overdone. The lamb-beef balls mix was lovely, stewed in herby tomato sauce.
Their summerlicious menu was great value for the money- three courses for $25 and the dessert was really unique, something I never heard of- a creamy thing drizzled with rose oil!
I've had catering, takeout, and summerlicious at this location - always lovely. Try it for a step away from the ordinary Middle-Eastern takeout."}
{"text":"This place is great! A little hidden gem you could even say.

The portions are huge, I could easily split a meal with someone and still be full!
The plates are full of wonderful bursting flavour! 

They also have a few beers/wines/ciders that you can order."}
{"text":"I must say that this evening is tough to forget. Food, atmosphere, service and price. 

We had starters, labni, falafel and roasted cauliflower. All were stunning, but if I had to pick one, the edge goes to the cauliflower. Stunning sauce with lemon juice. Decadent, but full respect to the falafel and labni.

My son went with the lamb and beef on rice, he says he'll eat it again...and again, my wife the chicken kebabs on rice...same comment.

I had grilled egg plant on rice. Can't understand how it tasted so great. 

The rice is not just rice. The lentils in the rice take it to a whole other level. Vegetarians should feel like 1st class citizens here. 

Finishing with baklava and a warm custard fill pastry where delightful. 

Great food, wonderful service, great staff. Reasonable price. Always finish with Lebanese coffee. Cardamom and strong coffee are an excellent finish."}
{"text":"Interesting spot at Yonge and Davisville. Bills itself as a upscale Mediterranean, which is one of my favorite kinds of food. I came here for lunch on Saturday with the family. I had the lentil soup and the Kübbè in a Pita. (Kubbe is cracked wheat balls stuff with meat and a variety of seasonings). It was okay. The lentil soup was hot, but didn't have alot of flavour. The kubbe was also okay, and I was curious to try it. This is a decent spot for lunch."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern cuisine I ever had. High quality, fresh and very good taste! 
Comparable to best restaurants I've tried in Damascus.
Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars**
It was a really nice night spent here. And food is 100% 4-5 stars. Interior is beautiful and intimate perfect for a date or catchup with a close friend. There dips and humus and babagAnou was to die for and had great flavour. The meats and other protein items were well Flavoured and seasoned. Pricing is fair for everything drinks included. Only comment is our server was overally relaxed to the point where my best friend had to bring her own plate back to the kitchen haha. Otherwise after hat point I think the host talked to the man so she was from then on overally enthusiastic and checking on us +++

Would return but on  a less busy night."}
{"text":"Last night I went to Tabule with my mom, step-dad, husband and sister.  The place was utterly slammed.  Because it's a small restaurant, there wasn't much room for those of us waiting for tables to stand and wait, which meant servers had to squeeze by the dense crowd of people quite often to get to their tables.  It could easily have descended into unpleasantness.  

Instead, the servers were thoughtful, polite and seemed genuinely apologetic that we had to wait.  The manager on the floor gave us regular updates on the status of our table, and when we were eventually seated, our server came to check in immediately.  We got warm, professional and super-speedy service with no trace of the annoyance or panic that you might normally feel at a restaurant that's been overwhelmed with too many people all at once.  And the food?  Still perfectly cooked, delicious and generous.  

Tabule, you're becoming one of my very favourite restaurants in this city.  And for those reading this review: Saturday nights are BUSY.  Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious.

Generous portions and good service. Definitely paying for the atmosphere as the food itself is alright. Unfortunately, the salad was a little too sour for my preference but very good food overall.

Desserts were well done."}
{"text":"Food was decent but not worth the prices and not overly exciting.  When I eat middle Eastern food, the flavours should really pop with fresh herbs, garlic, -- the flavours were quite bland here.  
The appetizer falafel was good but again, rather bland, even the tahini was bland.
And I Had the marinated char broiled chicken for a main (which they charged me an extra $2.00 to sub extra veggies for the rice). The chicken was pretty dry, the veggies overly oily, nothing special... but passable."}
{"text":"We were here last week. I didn't find anything spectacular about it. The food was normal, service was very delayed and the house was not even half full. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday celebration. Best middle eastern menu. Had a vegan with us and everyone had lots of choices and enjoyed every dish. Restaurant was really crowded on a Saturday night so recommend reservations but service was excellent and unhurried. Homemade lentil soup, grilled tomatoes in sauce and lamb were especially tasty. Would highly recommend and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I used to really LOVE Tabule. The food is so good, the service is attentive, lots of the things on the menu I love. But. One day a server accidentally mentioned that their rice is cooked on chicken stock. Wha? This is NOT mentioned in their menu, and I do not eat meat out for religious reasons.  And earlier in the year, another religious friend called Tabule to inquire about their cooking practices. And nothing was mentioned about how they cook their regular rice. Not so cool, Tabule, not so cool. When I inquired further Tabule informed me that they have a special vegan rice (mixed with lentils which don't work so well with my stomach) and for which I have to pay an extra $2.50. why do we have to pay extra? Lentils are cheap.  And now Tabule is a part of Veggielicious event.  Ridiculous. I think these are just WRONG business practices. If you cook your sides on chicken, fish or beef stock, just indicate this on the menu. It is important for many of us. I will not be back."}
{"text":"LOVE TABULE! Caps lock is very necessary here as I try to portray my love of this restaurant to you.

As someone who grew up on middle-eastern food, specifically Lebanese, I am un  peu snob about this (not so much about my French language skills though). 90% of my Lebanese food intake is done at home or at family gatherings - all of which I get amazing home-cooked food; 5% is taken in at Armenian Kitchen and the other 5% is now from Tabule. When we Armenians talk about food, we take it seriously and don't f#$& around.

When I was first introduced to it, I couldn't take it seriously because it's located in midtown - and any good middle eastern food couldn't be south of the 401, right? Wrong!!! Tabule is as authentic as it gets and it's fresh and spiced to perfection!

The staff is friendly and very helpful for those who need assistance with the menu. I personally prefer to eat tapas-style, and the menu is perfect for that.

GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY :)
1) Gluten-free laffa flat bread: this is unheard of, gluten-free bread at a restaurant!!! Makes the meal so much more enjoyable :)
2) Tabule: make it gluten free made with organic quinoa 
*This is exactly how I make my tabule at home, replace the cracked wheat with quinoa~~
3) Falafel: made GF


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) Fattoush: traditional Lebanese salad.
2) Lentil soup
3) Sampler platter: (3 of hummus, babaganoush, lebne*so good*, tabule)
4) Hallum salad: if you haven't tried hallum before, take the opportunity now!
5) Basturma: this is a traditional \"cured meat\" appetizer - not for the faint of heart. It is the strongest flavour out there, you'll be needing to seriously wash your hands after but it is so worth it!!!
6) Fried eggplant
7) Falafel: DUH
8) Kefta: mixed ground lamb and beef with onions, parsley, oregano (the essentials). This is my favourite personally. 

..all that & the price is right! I've been coming here often and absolutely love it. They always participate in summer/winterlicious too."}
{"text":"Four of us came for a birthday dinner and had a feast. I have to say that while all the vegetarian options were delicious, the meat selection were a disappointment. We got a appetizer sampler of hummus, babaganoush and tabule. I really have to say that I'm a fan! My eggplant main was cooked to perfection - lightly flakey on the outside and so tender and juicy on the inside.  The pomegranate seeds integrated into my mujadara was an unexpected and surprising nice touch.

The kubbe, a wheat ball with meat, along with the Lebanese sausage just didn't sit right with me. Maybe it was the spices? I also tried my friend's kefta main which was a mix of lamb and beef - it felt a bit dry.

They had belly dancing entertainment halfway through the meal. It adds to the middle Eastern atmosphere for sure! While I actually found it anything, I'm sure most people would enjoy it very much."}
{"text":"Wow. 
We had a fabulous meal here. 

I've walked by this restaurant numerous times (i used to work down the street) but had never ventured in there until my sis visited and wanted good Mediterranean cuisine

Definitely make a reservation; the restaurant was packed on a Thursday night around 8p. 

Food:
We ordered a bunch of appetizers  and 2 mains between the 4 of us:

- Sampler Platter of hummus, babagnouj, tabule: 
i'm not a fan of parsley, but the tabule was awesome! so fresh
- Deep fried Cauliflower: YUM. One of my fave dishes of the night. it was perfectly done and very tasty
- Fried Eggplant: delish!
- Falafels: I loved their falafels. one of the best falafels i've ever had
- Lamb and beef kebabs with fries: lamb was very flavorful
- Grilled Chicken breast with roasted veges: i'm not usually a fan of grilled chicken breast (too dry) but this was juicy and flavorful, and the grilled veges is the way to go- so yummy!
- Dessert: Künafa ashta. Lebanese custard topped with  fine shreds of phyllo pastry, pistachios and rose water syrup. This is definitely an acquired taste; it tasted like potpurri to me...

The check came up to $70++ + tip; very reasonable and a very pleasant surprise for a neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Probably the best falafel ever!  Crispy and delish. Great vibe, food, and service"}
{"text":"I am very very impressed with the food in this place. We started with some falafel balls and humous which was absolutely fresh and tasty. 
We then continued to eat some chicken skewers along with some side salads pita and fish. All were very tasty. We finished up with some desert and coffee. Also a great choice to finish the meal."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday, I had a large group and although they were very busy, they accommodated us right away. 

I ordered the Kefta dinner which came with rice and vegetables. It was a pretty big portion and tasted good. All of my guests seemed pleased with their meals (even Vegans!) Yummy!"}
{"text":"Tonight I made my fourth visit to what is fast becoming my favourite local restaurant. On this occasion, we brought my in laws. MIL and wifey had the shrimp, FIL had beef and I had a deadly char-grilled chicken breast. The rice was flavourful, the veges grilled beautifully and the babaganoush and pitas were a perfect accompaniment. All this for a reasonable price. Booze hounds will be pleased to note that the $5.50 bottles of beer and $35-45 bottles of mid-range wine are pretty good value too."}
{"text":"What a treat to have such a gem so close to home. From food to drink to service this was a really great experience. 

Everything was so refreshing and delicious from their tasty cocktails to their crispy and most falafel. Would recommend to anyone and everyone just be sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. The atmosphere and interior design is almost non existant. I mean if it was not for the few pictures on the walls you will not know you are in a middle eastern restaurant. We went there for brunch a few weeks ago, it was a beautiful sunny day out side but the place was so dark. I understand it does not get enough sun but the lights inside were all off, gives an uninviting vibe. Playing Elvis in the back ground!! Why not something Middle Eastern? 
I give it 3 stars for food and 1 star for the experience.
But 4 stars for the lovely waitress."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere! 
Amazing food! We had the homemade lentil soup, fried eggplant, chicken and rice, the babaganuj and the pickle/hot peppers combo. Everything was amazing. Staff are friendly and on point! Indid find it odd that they charge $0.75 for the smallest amount of hot sauce but other than that, you must try it!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love sharing a bunch of mezzes (appetizers) and a bottle of wine with a group of friends!  This restaurant has been on my short list for the 'licious events for several seasons, but I'd never made it there until it was chosen this month for my dining group.  It's size is deceiving, I thought it was just one little area with seating for about 20, but then you go around the corner and there's double the amount of space.  The décor was typical for a Middle Eastern restaurant, and not overdone.  I also really liked that they had a dish of pickled nibbles on the table - olives, hot peppers, radish, etc.  The service was excellent, our server was friendly and helpful with our selections and very patient with us as well.  Whenever we needed something, she was there, but at the same time she wasn't overbearing.  

We ordered: 
-a sample platter of dips including babaganuj, humus, and labni:  Each of the dips was delicious and creamy, and we were provided with extra pitas without hassle.  For those who like a little spice, try the labni (a yogurt based dip) on the pita with one of the hot peppers from the pickle dish - it's like a jalapeno popper! 

-fried eggplant: Before I tried it, someone mentioned it and I couldn't believe how true it was: it tasted like a toasted marshmallow.  Don't ask me how, I can't explain it...it just did.

-cauliflower: really tasty and surprised me as I thought it would likely be kind of a dull dish.  It had nice seasonings and was served with a little sauce on top that was a great complement.

-falafel: I've never actually had falafel (I know, I know) so I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it - but it was delicious!  The sauce again was a perfect accompaniment. 

-grape leaves: I've been in love with stuffed grape or vine leaves since I tried them earlier this year, and have tried them many times since - and often been disappointed.  This vegetarian version was just perfect though. 

-sausage: This also packed a surprise, with a sneaking spice.  My first bite I didn't think it was spicy at all, but it hits you after a bit.  Still a good level of spice, most people could definitely handle it.  The really surprising thing about this sausage though was that it had a definite flavour of cinnamon.  It was very good, but never what I would have expected in a sausage.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some Middle Eastern flair.  I will definitely be back.

Oh, and yes, the way they pour the water is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I went to Tabule on a first date, and we both loved it. The waitor was very friendly. We asked her to recommend her favourite dish, and we had a falafel plate with cauliflower and 3 spreads. The cauliflower was deliciously seasoned!!! 

We teased our waitor for her being required by her job to do the neat \"pour the water and hold the jug at a distance\" piece of showmanship that all the waitors at Tabule do, and we left her a generous tip. 

I think it's closer to Rosedale station than to Eglinton station. The price could be argued to be a tiny bit high for what you get, but I didn't feel at all like I was wasting my money. The level of service and the ambiance were worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service!  They have a lot of vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to restaurants!  My favourites are the lentil soup (no cream or dairy), the hummus and warm pita to dip, the cauliflower tossed in tahini, the eggplant, and the tawuk (chicken skewers).  I have dined in and ordered several times.  I find they take allergies seriously and provide prompt and attentive customer service.  I recommend making a reservation for a weekend visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I entertained a colleague at Tabule. The service and food were excellent. All dishes, the appetizers and the main courses were very tasty and cooked to our request."}
{"text":"We had the summerlicious menu here and it was good for the price but the food wasn't amazing. For appetizers I had the fried cauliflowers and they were quite good, and my husband had the combination plate with babaganoush and hummus which was also tasty. We both got the lamb/beef kebabs as the main meal, which were good but not memorable. Dessert was pistachio gelato which tasted more like icecream. Overall it was good but I wouldn't go back because it wasn't an above average meal."}
{"text":"Great food, whilst we were waiting for our bill, the waitress took a white cloth, wiped the floor and went to the bar and wiped down the counter with the same cloth. When I mentioned this to our lady friend, she mentioned that she had used the washroom it was disgustingly dirty  and with a foul odour. 
The cleanliness of the restaurant is a sign of how clean the kitchen is. We will NEVER eat their again."}
{"text":"I went to Tabule with some friends during Summerlicious. We got a 3-course lunch for $15, and overall, it was a fine experience. The service was a little bit slow at times, but the food was good. The burnt honey gelato was absolutely out of this world, and was definitely the highlight for me. My only complaint about the food is that for the kefta kebab, we only got 3 pieces of kefta, which wasn't as much as I would have expected for a main dish. Then again, when you're getting 3 courses, you don't need a lot of food for a main."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and this restaurant has been a favourite w my partner and our friends for a very long time. The food is consistently good.  
 
For the  last little while, they have been nickel and diming their patrons.  They raised their prices, understandable considering the raise in the minimum wage. They no longer offer pita with their meals; they stopped serving  a complimentary relish dish ( always a nice touch) and today we were charged $1.50 for a bit of tahini. The reason given was that the suppliers have raised their prices. The only reason we ask for tahini is because they do not have dijon mustard - always available in good dining establishments. Where will it stop- charging for tap water next?
I'm sure the owners are aware that there are many dining choices in the Toronto area...."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now with my gf. Good experiences both times. Food was good. But nothing incredibly memorable. Try the sampler platter to start. Will be back for a return visit."}
{"text":"Coming from Ottawa where the Lebanese food is plentiful and also having a Lebanese background makes me very picky about Middle Eastern food. This restaurant was outstanding. I came here tonight (Thursday around 6pm) with two of my girlfriends to catch up and everyone left very satisfied! Staff was very friendly and service was great. They gave us some pickles and hot peppers to snack on as soon as we sat. 

All three of us ordered different cocktails, sampled each and all decided we enjoyed all of them equally. We shared the falafel for an appetizer and it was perfectly crunchy on the outside and super soft and moist on the inside. They also brought out freshly baked pita but would suggest to order some type of dip with them. 

For our entrees we all ordered meat mains that came with delicious roasted veggies (could have been a little more veggies to be honest) and flavourful rice. I ordered the beef and it was cooked perfectly medium rare. They also asked us if we would like any sauce - get 2 of sea of the garlic! 

We were too stuffed for dessert but would have loved to try it! My bill came to about $40 (cocktail plus entree and tip) which I'll pay for great food any day!! 

Would highly recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant good enough to make me break my eater's block. That's right, my first review in 8+ months due to the lack of inspiring meals in my life. Okay fine, sheer laziness may have been a factor. 

We started with the sample platter ($14) of cold mezzes. Or appetizers, for us uncultured folks:  

Hummus: As the in-house hummus helper, you know I will not pass up the opportunity to hummus. Glad to report that it did not disappoint. It hit the perfect sweet spot of being blended well enough that you can taste the chickpea pulp and evidence of their former selves but not so much that it becomes a watery paste. You know what I mean.  

Babaganüj: This was my favourite dish of the night, it was just flabbergastingly good. I have never been a huge fan of the baba, but their BBQing of the eggplants really brought out a smoky taste. 

Tabülè: I was being a fancy-pants and asked for the gluten free organic quinoa version. Honestly, you can't even tell the difference because they barely put any in there. Save yourself the $1.50 and let your leaky gut leak. 

Fattüsh Salad ($9.95): the refreshing tomato-cucumber combo makes this an excellent choice for a summer evening. If you're watching carbs, this salad actually has quite a few pita bits.

Cauliflower ($7.50):  you know when people eat random meats and claims that it tastes like chicken? I'd like to consider myself and my refined taste buds above that, but this seriously tastes like chicken. I guess it's even better, since it's a vegetable and vegetables are good for you? Not sure how healthy flash frying is, but I support the cause. 

Garlic shrimp ($12.95): tomato-garlic sauce, good but not outstandingly unique 

In terms of overall atmosphere - the service was amazing, their opened door-windows really adds to the summer patio feel, and plus their restroom soap smells just divine. So, it's a win win in my books - five stars!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The veal was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The lemonade was also a hit. Service was friendly and pleasant. Only complaint: there were a lot of fruit flies around."}
{"text":"My first visit to Tabule and I enjoyed their Middle Eastern food. It has a nice warm, quiet atmosphere at the restaurant. My favourite dish was the appetiser, Fried Eggplant. It comes with a lemon and garlic dressing and was cooked perfectly and not oily. 

The Kefta dish with beef and lamb skewers was also flavourful. And my friend said the Falafel was also good. They didn't have their coffee frothing machine working today so, I tried their Cinnamon and Ginger Tea. I liked how the tea was presented came in a small metal tea pot and with a small glass cup. All in all a good meal and worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good.  Fresh and well prepared.  Prices are quite reasonable and service is good.  I've been to the one at Yonge & Eglinton a few times and it's often very busy.  Overall great food and value."}
{"text":"I really don't understand how this place has gotten so much hating by Torontonians! I honestly think it's the best Middle Eastern in the city and my Israeli girlfriend clams the best Baba ghanoush she's had outside of Israel...I'd say that's a pretty big thumbs up...

I've been here twice now and each time I've left completely satisfied and had a great time. We had Ashley as a server both times and her recommendations and service is fabulous. Table favourites are the Baba ghanoush, falafel and cauliflower. 

If you like Middle Eastern food, you've definitely got to give Tabule a try."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic ambience (5/5) and good service (5/5). The food is OK 3/5. They make it very relaxing if you go there with you family, the staff went above and beyond to make me comfortable. I would go back for the great ambience and the friendly and warmly attentive service."}
{"text":"Spectacular service, value, and Summerlicious menu!

I'm a huge fan of plant-based (vegan/vegetarian) Middle Eastern food, but so far have found the Tabule series (this one and Souk Tabule in the Canary District) to be my favorite in Toronto. I was so happy with my Summerlicious lunch today. We made a reservation for two at noon a week ago and glad we booked in advance because the place seems to be a community favorite as the space does fill up! After having had a few tragic -licious experiences, i.e. tiny portions and compromised quality, I was kind of expecting to leave hungry. But noooo, the portion sizes here are fantastically large for every course; my tiny gf couldn't finish her main and dessert after the huge combination platter appetizer. We both thought the appetizer alone would've been sufficient as a meal. 

There are lots of wonderful vegan options! Don't assume that Middle Eastern food is only about the kebabs :P We ordered the combination platter (vegan) to start and it's basically a mezze plate with generous amounts of hummus, baba ganoush, 3 fried falafels (which were oh-so-aromatic and flavorful), and a tabbouleh salad. The platter came with 4 half slices of thick pita, 2 of which are whole wheat. Very filling. For mains we both ordered the vegan eggplant dinner, which comes with roasted eggplant, peppers, onions, and caramelized onions (so tender and sweet!) on dirty rice (rice and lentils) with tahini drizzle. The rice-lentil base was so yummy I was tempted to order a second helping of just that, but decided to leave room for dessert. The vegan rice pudding was not overly sweet like the grocery store variety - instead the flavors come from the Middle Eastern spices and raisins. Even though it was a large portion and supposed to be dense due to the ingredients, it felt so light going down.

The servers were so attentive and all smiles and our waters were constantly refilled. 5/5 would return again and again - only wish that there was a location in Downtown Core!"}
{"text":"Most memorable feature: Stunning service

Tabule was a big surprise.  The summerlicious dinner portions were huge and the wait staff do this amazing water pouring thing that never stops being entertaining.  Many friends were very happy with the many vegan options on the summerlicious menu.  Waiter were very professional and told us that the sorbet had melted but the other dessert options were amazing nonetheless.  Almost everyone left with doggie bags.  Would come back.

Dishes ordered: combination plate, fried eggplant, salmon kebab, tawuk, falafel dinner, rice pudding, knaffa ashta"}

Value: 6/10

Came here for lunch with a large group. I've had a lot of middle-eastern food so I might have had too high an expectation for this place.

We started with the baba ganüj, hümus and tabülè. Though it wasn't bad, I've definitely had much better, and the tabule had a little too much lemon. Also got to try the lentil soup and falafel. The lentil soup was a bit disappointing and tasted watered down to me. The falafel was really good though, crispy on the outside and not dry on the inside. I personally ordered a fattüsh salad with an order of kefta (+$6.95/skewer). The fattüsh salad was the same as the tabülè, just way too much lemon juice. It completely overpowered anything else, and this is coming from someone that enjoys eating lemons by themselves. The kefta were ok, but definitely not even close to the best I've had in the GTA (I do prefer a more spiced kefta). I managed to try someone else's eggplant dish and that was great. 

The quality of the food isn't bad. The average cost of the food here was ~$20 (tax and tip included), which being in the city is reasonable. I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere here, but as someone who eats for the sake of the food rather than just atmosphere, I'd rather pay for just the food cost. At most other middle-eastern restaurants in Mississauga, I'd be paying ~$12 for almost double the portion and much better flavour. 

The store is clean and nicely decorated, it reminds me of some of the restaurants in Marrakech. The service and waiting staff are courteous and friendly. They also didn't try to cheat us and made sure to mention that our service charge was included (Definitely appreciated).

This place isn't a bad place to try out, but personally I have a few other places I'd prefer to go to simply cause the flavours don't really match my palette."}
{"text":"My wife 7 I have been here many times since we found it, and it is definitely \"as good as it gets\" for Middle eastern food in Toronto. At least from what we've tried so far. They have veggie options, vegan options, ethical meat options, and, of course, the food is DELICIOUS!! I highly recommend this restaurant. Often.

As well they deliver, which is convenient."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, lots of options for vegetarians and if you are kosher. We enjoyed the sharing plate with hummus babaganush and falafel and the cheese with zdatar,  sounds like not enough for two but we were actually full, however we had to try the baklava with some coffee, amazing! Usually the baklavas that I have tried are way too sweet, this one was perfect.
They have a special lunch menu which is more affordable. 
Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Food is a bit expensive when quantity is compared. Servers can be rude sometimes. Make sure to ask for charges in case the server is recommending something instead of regular food.
Overall food quality is good."}
{"text":"A wonderful dinner with friends on a Saturday nights. We were happy with our drinks (beers, Queen 501 Cider and an old fashioned) and the food. The service was fast and attentive. All our main dishes were big sized portions, so come with a big appetite! We ordered the Kefta, Kefta Banadura, and the eggplant entree, and thoroughly enjoyed everything !"}
{"text":"This is a great place to try Lebanese food, it's well priced, the portions are generous, and the food is delicious. I don't know how authentic it is, or if it's more touristic Lebanese food, but it's a nice change. I had the kefta dinner, which was good, very similar to Persian or Greek food. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Will start giving them props for their delivery, especially on Sundays and holidays! Also generous portions, which mean even when you eat in you will have leftovers to bring home. I always gravitate to the predictable parts of the menu falafel, tabbouleh, fatoush and hummus...always good and fresh. I find the physical space too dark and run down and the air-con is not strong enough to cool things in the summer. Good neighbourhood spot, but nothing super special."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout last night--first time. Everything was beautifully packed in reuseable containers (a bonus) and was hot when I brought it to the table--except the pita. Eggplant and flash-fried cauliflower almost as good as the resto, as was the skewers of kefta and chicken, both with lots of rice and vegs. Very good and very reasonable."}
{"text":"Nice place on Yonge with a big sitting area . The typical Lebanese restaurant with good selection of food. But the wines were a little over priced. Overall nice place to go for hummus:)"}
{"text":"We ordered in for 13 people. I called and spoke to Jamie she was amazing. She assisted me with the menu, delivery time and coordinating nut and Sesame free items The food arrived on time hot and everything was totally delicious highly recommend  restaurant for eat in or take out"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Middle Eastern restaurants in Toronto. The Lamb chops were tender when cooked medium rare and the chicken was moist & juicy. Lovely warm, cozy, atmosphere and the staff were helpful and checked in with us just often enough to feel welcome, even on a busy Mother's Day Sunday. The fried eggplant mezze was so simple yet earthy. The garlic tomato mezze was the only off note, and even then still decent. 

All on all a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This place stands out in how they pour water out of a Middle Eastern container. They also put crispy onions on top. The flavor of my kefta was good and it wasn't dry. However I was hoping the portions would be bigger. Everything about the experience was a 4/5. My friends loved having dinner here. They quite enjoyed their chicken kebab and eggplant entree."}
{"text":"I don't know.  But I eat several time at this place and found it untasty at all and most of the food is salty with really expensive prices"}
{"text":"My family came to Tabule Midtown for a birthday dinner and weren't disappointed! 
We ordered the falafel, tabule, babaganuj, hummus, and hallum salad as starters; everything was fresh and had amazing flavour. The babaganuj, hummus, and tabule come with complementary pita bread (white and whole wheat). The babaganuj wasn't too smoky, which is something I've encountered at other establishments. 
I ordered the kefta entree which was, overall, delicious (I could eat a bowl of their rice!). The meat itself, although a little too salty for me, was nicely spiced/herbed and grilled to perfection - cooked through, a smidge pink, and very juicy!  
Their From Beiruit with Passion mojito I found too strong until the ice melted (more on the too sweet side as opposed to too much alcohol) otherwise very tasty! 
And for dessert I had mahalabiya which was fantastic but if you don't like super sweet syrups just let it drain off the custard. The custard itself is like a firmer créme caramel with less (no?) egg. I also got a taste of their mango sorbet, burnt honey ice cream, and kunafa ashta. The sorbet and ice cream are KILLER (if I lived closer I would definitely come back for these). The kunafa ashta is good too: similar to the muhalabiya custard based with the rose water syrup but with filo.
Service was great here; our waitress was friendly and very attentive but didn't smother us."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying that I got take out last week from here so I can't really comment on the dining in experience except for what I saw while waiting for my order.  

This restaurant looks small on the outside but it's pretty large inside.  Already by 5:30pm the restaurant was about 3/4 packed.  I was impressed that they had a lot of staff here so it didn't look like it would be a long wait for your food.

While this place does takeout there really isn't any place to wait while getting your food.  There is a bar in the middle of the restaurant but you seem to feel in the way with all the servers running around.  It has those lovely Moroccan lights hanging from the ceiling and Middle Eastern music playing in the background - makes you want to get up and dance :) 

The staff were really nice to me - offered me water while I waited.  I ordered the Kefta (2 lamb/beef skewers) with rice mixed with veggies and it comes with a side of pickled veggies.  It was about $18 with tax.  Pricey.  I found the skewers to be more tough than I would have preferred and a little dry.  The veggies in the rice - roasted peppers, eggplants added a nice touch to the rice which was nice and juicy (can you say juicy for rice??!).  It comes with 2 pieces of pita bread - you can choose between white and whole wheat.  Not sure if dining in would have resulted in a different experience.  The portion was decent - enough for my dinner and for lunch the next day.

The service is really friendly - everyone was polite and they even apologized for my order taking so long.

I would try this place again - but dine in to see if it offers a different experience."}
{"text":"Beef plate which has 2 skewers of the most tender no-dentures-required-as-it-melts-in-your-mouth beef I have ever tried with rice is a MUST!! Cauliflower was surprisingly delightful.  

Hummus and babaganuj are always good! Red snapper was flavourful but we don't know what to make of the akaawi cheese and kefta. 

Blood orange  sorbet was refreshing, burnt honey gelato was delicious and not overly sweet, Mühalabiya
wasn't bad and baklava can never be bad. 

Reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Tabule. The kefta was as well-spiced and delicious as any I've had--and I love a Mediterranean restaurant. The Lebanese-style rice was good. My husband really enjoyed his chicken, and our friend her shrimp. The vegetables were well grilled so as not to be soft and soggy.

The falafel was not the most flavorful I've had but add some hummus and tahini and who notices anyway?

Plus they fit us in on a Saturday night, the staff was attentive, the food came out pretty quickly for how full the place was... Overall, quite pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"We love tabule

We tried it first during summerlicious and have made it a regular since then.   The hummus babaganoush and all the spreads are very tasty.  

My fiancée always gets the falafel which she says is the best she has has and I get the lamb / beef kefta.  It comes in a tomato broth that is unreal when mixed with rice.   

Extra points for some of the best mojitos we have ever tasted. 

The best part is they do takeout as well, so if you wanna just bring some home and enjoy you can!!!!!!!!!! 

Like having a taste of the Mediterranean at your door step."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night without reservations and was seated fairly quickly. The ambience was casual and comfortable with dim lighting and pretty stained glass lamp fixtures. 
There were quite a few menu options with cold and hot appetizers plus a decent drink menu. 

I ordered the grilled eggplant as my main which is a vegetarian dish served with Mujaddara (long grain rice with lentils and caramelized onions), grilled vegetables and drizzled with tahini. I also ordered the Arnabeet which is fried cauliflower with tahini. 
The portions are definitely enough for one person, I had to take some to go. I was very satisfied with both dishes especially the eggplant. It was quite flavourful and you can never go wrong with grilled anything. The eggplants were decently sized and the rice was cooked just right. Only thing missing were the pomegranate seeds that were listed on the menu. My friend ordered the falafel which was really good too. The texture of the falafel wasn't too dense on the inside which is often the issue with falafels I've had in the past. 
All in all, the food was great and I'm glad I came. Definitely will be back to try the rest of their menu and their drinks."}
{"text":"I rarely venture this far from the core except for food and this trip was definitely worth it.

The dish that surprised me the most the fried eggplant with the lemony garlic dressing. Now, I don't usually think eggplant is da bomb but wow.....like wow. I actually crave this eggplant dish.  This one is a must order!

The other items we tried:hummus, tabule, babaganoush and falafel were tasty and exactly how you would expect fresh made versions of those to taste. They won't disappoint you.

I was quite taken by their cocktails. If you prefer things less sweet, just let the server now. I found most of their concoctions on the sweet side which made this gal very happy. I had the Beirut With Passion made with bacaradi rum, malibu passion rum, fresh watermelon juice, passionfruit juice lime mint, sugar syrup. Really tempted to try making this at home.

My entree was the Kefta dish that had two juicy skewers of ground mixed lamb and beef with onions, parsley, garlic and spices served with rice. Ate all of this! Personally I liked it better than the popular chicken skewers but that's just me.

Another favourite dish for me was the dessert. If you don't like rose water this may not be to your liking but it was divine. I had the Künafa Ashta
filo layered with custard and topped off with rose water syrup.

Customer service was spot on. The atmosphere inviting and the prices quite reasonable. An enjoyable and lively spot for dinner.   Highly recommend.

PS... The way they pour water is an excellent Instagram moment (I'm just sayin :)"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! Food is always consistently good! The staff that work there are really nice and are great at what they do!"}
{"text":"I like its environment, the light was so romantic and the food was good. It was little oily but still yummy. I had lamb, with vegetables. The price is not bad but it would be better if it is less."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend so I went. 
I think it's honestly average. 2.5/5

$12 I get a plate of rice, salad and 3 nuggets of kabab. Portion wise it was overrated by yelpers. Taste is average, nothing special. Cauliflower dish was tastey but again portion wise it was barely anything. 

A cocktail costs $12 which is more than an actual meal.. too much ice they put in it. Barely tastes the alcohol. 

Also the patio seats provides no shades. My and my friends were sunburned so back we wanted to finish our food early so we can leave. 

I don't think I'm going back."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch...I'm not sure if I would go there for dinner.  

My favourite \"go-to\" dish for lunch is the falafel in a pita served with fries.  It's relatively inexpensive, and it's just delicious.  The fries are perfectly cooked...crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.

The falafel is so well put together...it's very tidy and stuff doesn't fall out of it when you bite into it.  And when you bite into it, it's just so crunchy and delicious and fresh.  I just love it.  I would totally have this over Subway any day of the week."}
{"text":"Ok, I never give five stars, but this place deserves it. The food was fantastic, from the perfect crunchiness of the falafel, to the subtle and just-right type of olive oil in the hummus, to the amazing melt-in-your mouth shish taouk. Just fabulous. Amazing service, friendly staff and just an overall great ambiance. Down to earth yet sophisticated in its simplicity. Went for summerlicious 2015 lunch. Authentic. Real. A must-try! Loved it."}
{"text":"I lived in lebanon for 8 years and have a solid exposure to the food there. The falafels were tasty but not served with pickles, parsley, tomatoes etc. They were served with tahini and pita only.  The fattouch was all cucumber and tomatoes with very little pita crisps and mint/parsley/ anything else. The knafe was mostly custard!! thats right, custard!! i have never had knafe made from custard. That is basically a canadianized knafeh."}
{"text":"Hummus, taboule, baba ganoush, pita, and falafels were all good -- 3-4 stars.
Grape leaves were boring -- 2 stars.
Service -- 4 stars.
I wouldn't vote no to going back, but wouldn't choose this place on my own."}
{"text":"My sister and I went in here when we were in Toronto. We were out exploring sites from Degrassi Junior High and wanted something \"Mediterranean\" so we stopped in.  

We went in and the hostess was like \"do you have a reservation?\" when there were maybe 15 open tables. We said no and in the time honored tradition of looking pained and miserable, she said, \"sorry we don't have anything open... unless you want to sit at the bar.\" It was late and we were on our way to Ottawa afterward so what the hell? What a nice choice we made. 

The bartender was extremely nice and friendly. The food was great and the bar was actually a lot of fun. There were some other people there too that we chatted with. Sometimes when you are on a long road trip with someone, it can be nice to have conversation with someone else. I am really happy we ended up at the bar and not one of the tables. It was a very pleasant dinner in a nicely decorated space. And oddly enough even after we left the place still had quite a few tables still open."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend while visiting her and had a fantastic meal--easily on par with any of the great Middle Eastern offerings back home in NYC. The hummus was creamy and flavorful as our starter and easily some of the best I've had. GF got the entree sized falafel and I got beef skewers. We shared (why date if you can't eat off their plate?), since both came in generous portion sizes. The falafel was crisp and had a great texture, without being too dry or greasy as bad falafel so often is, and was spiced just right. The beef was cooked to perfection, too often \"medium rare\" comes out looking more medium in restaurants, but this was a hit and melt in your mouth tender. Even the rice and veg it was served on were good enough to stand on their own. We enjoyed some after dinner mint tea the likes of which I've not had since a trip to Turkey.

Even better than the food was the service! Our server (starts with an S, I'm bad with names!) was attentive and very pleasant. The atmosphere was great too. This place is the real deal and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I always go once during Winterlicious or Summerlicious. That Menu is usually satisfying. 

Good food, Flavourful and well-presented. It is a good place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Second time here & will be back. The lamb and beef kefta was a little dry but the last time I was here it was super moist & delicious! Staff is friendly and our waiter was great :)"}
{"text":"I dropped in for a late lunch on a friend's recommendation
Food was good but 3 pm is not a time of day to enjoy any atmosphere 
I will try again some evening"}
{"text":"Their falafel was great!  I would recommend you get that to start. For the main, I got the beef skewers which was really tender and delicious. Portions are pretty large - if you don't eat much, you won't be able to finish the dish plus an appetizer. Don't be silly and fill up on bread either, despite how good it is!! 

I liked how they poured my water though, lifting the bottle up high and all. Though I didn't notice how it affected the taste of my water, it was a nice gimmick and it gave her style points for refilling my drink."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for a couple of years now and I've been meaning to check out Tabule, since I've heard nothing but good things. Winterlicious provided a perfect opportunity to finally sample their wares.

I started with the Combination Plate (humüs, babaganüj, tabülè and falafel), and I have to say, having grown up in a house where all these things were regularly on offer, I was very impressed with both the quality and the authenticity. I'll admit that the humüs was the weakest link here, as it didn't seem to contain enough garlic or tahini. The falafel was pretty outstanding, though. I should also mention that this was a pretty enormous plate; there's more than enough here for two people to share.

For my main, I ordered the Kefta Kebab (juicy skewer of Middle Eastern spiced mixed ground lamb and beef). Again, this was delicious. (There definitely wasn't enough of the actual Kefta for my liking, however.) The meat was flavorful and piping hot, while the salad and rice were both very tasty. I could've used some kind of yogurt-based sauce for the rice, though.

Dessert was Knaffa Ashta (angel hair filo layered with custard and topped off with rose water syrup). Now, I've had the real thing in the Middle East and this was, unfortunately, not authentic at all. Traditionally, knaffa contains a layer of a soft white cheese and it's an ooey, gooey mess. This one substituted custard, which was jarring (to say the least). I will admit that once I got over my initial shock, I did embrace this as a very tasty (and filling) dessert.

All in all, Tabule is pretty great. I'm looking forward to trying more of their stuff."}
{"text":"This place delivers solid, delicious middle eastern fare in generous portions. I love the grilled salmon kebabs. They are quite zesty and juicy, and served with tasty rice and vegetables. We also love the sample platter with hummus, babaganuj, and labni. The labni especially is to die for! Yum."}
{"text":"It's a busy place, so the staff movement is predominant. It gives it a slightly frantic feel, but that's understandable. 

Some of the tables are set up in an awkward position. I could hear a room full of people behind me having a wonderful time, watching a belly dancer I guess, but all that great atmosphere was lost on me because I was facing a wall in a corner.

The food is very good. The portions are generous. The service was okay, not great, but as I said, they are very obviously busy, so it's not as though they are being lazy. 

I've been there twice and I will likely return, but I do think they could reorganize a few tables to make the experience more enjoyable for people."}
{"text":"Surprised that nobody reviewed this place yet.  I had a friend that came in from out of town which I haven't seen for awhile.  So I wanted to find a good place to catch up , something that was warm, intimate but also vibrant.  This place was all of the above and was also glad to find it relatively informal.  
I went here on a weekend  and was told that I just missed the belly dancer, in spite of this devastating event I soldiered on.  I found the staff was friendly and great to chat with.  The middle eastern decor wasn't overly stated, yet it did enough to create that exotic vibe.  I like how their menu was mostly hot apps, so if your open to sharing it would be a great way to sample different items on the menu.  We were told in advance to order their Hummus(the staple item) and glad we did. I also did the eggplant and split an entree which was a spicy kebab.  Overall it was a great experience and would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"The gave me and my colleague the wrong plates and all I got was an apology.  Kind of weird.  Food was very tasty, but left a bit hungry -- could do with larger portions."}
{"text":"If you like Mediterranean cuisine you'll like this place.  The lentil soup is traditional and delicious.  Hummus, babaganüj, and tabule are good choices for an appetizer platter.   We've been here a few times and tried many good entrees.  Of special note is the beef skewers, if you like beef like myself your probably familiar with the problems getting a skewer cooked properly and that isn't loaded with tough fat.  At Tabule the beef is cooked to desired doneness and good quality beef.  Other features include a small patio out front weather permitting and entertainment in the form of belly dancers some nights."}
{"text":"Went to tabule with my husband for lunch , I knew it would be busy for dinner so we decided on lunch since I hate waiting too long for a table . Our server was nice , we ordered the hummus, tabouleh and kebbe for appetizers and I had the keftah for the entree and my husband had the chicken liver . The food was good , the server didn't come check on us after the entree were served I was hearing her talking on the phone . When we were ready for the check she was nowhere to be found and my husband had to literary go and asked her for the check then she came back and said that she was sorry that she was taking take out orders but i was listening to her and she was having a personal conversation . i wanted to give them 4 stars but only 3 for the service cause  we were the only ones in the store there was no excuse!"}
{"text":"So glad I found Tabule. I had the chicken with rice and grilled vegetables. While it was a lot of food, it was a light meal and not too much. The rice was well-flavoured and the chicken was tender and seasoned. I also tried the lemon orange blossom juice which was pretty sour at first but grew on me. It's nice to see they have multiple non-alcoholic options aside from pop and typical juices like apple and orange. I sat on the patio and the server gave the perfect amount of attention, with plenty of water refills given it was a warm evening."}
{"text":"I had a flawless Winterlicious experience here.

Akaawi cheese appetizer: Who knew fried, spiced cheese could be so gaddamn perfect? Actually I'm pretty sure everyone knew BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS AMAZING. It was one of the best things I've eaten in a long, long time.

I went with the kefta banadura main (lamb/beef kebabs in a tomato-garlic sauce), and baklava for dessert. Both excellent choices as well. The meat was tender and the sauce was flavourful, and the baklava was melt-in-my-mouth delicious. It was a lot of food for $25, and my tiny self somehow managed to lick all my plates clean. Not a crumb in sight.

Service was great and friendly, and decor was cool. The food took pretty long (25+ minutes), but it was so good that I can't bring myself to take off a star. Will be back. Nomz."}
{"text":"Went with a co-worker for a weekday lunch.  We both ordered from the lunch menu - me the kefta kebab and she the eggplant pita.  My meal was $9 (plus tax and tip), hers was $7.50 - both very reasonable.  The kefta kabab was tasty and served with great rice and a fresh salad.  We left full but not overly stuffed - great lunch!"}
{"text":"Came back today for lunch with some friends.

I had their lentil soup and it was quite tasty albeit quite simple**.
They advertise the fact that there's no milk or cream in it so I guess it's healthy (I hope...)?

I'll be back.

{"text":"We come here often with friends and family. 
One of the best places for Mediterranean food nearby . The best part is the food is Always made very fresh ! Try the falafel or kababs. 

mostly meat options with a few veggie options . They have live belly dancing on some days.

The ambience is very nice. It is very close to Davisville metro."}
{"text":"I always order the Tawuk platter and it's so delicious. I can taste it right now as I write this. I also like the gimmick of how they pour the water (won't give it away here) and there is BYOB once a week. Always busy and I know why - reasonable prices, central location, great food."}
{"text":"If I lived in the Middle East, I would very likely become morbidly obese because their foods are so. Freakin'. Delicious.

Went to Tabule on a whim and had the most satisfying meal which made the 5lb I feel like I've thereupon gained to be worth it

Sampler Platter - we got the following 3:
Babaganüj - puréed BBQ eggplant mixed with lebanese tahini, garlic and fresh lemon juice 
Tabülè - hand chopped parsley salad with whole wheat bulgur, tomatoes, onions and a hint of mint tossed in a light lemon & olive oil dressing
Labni - homemade Lebanese yogurt cheese mixed with garlic & topped off with lebanese spices
Each of them tasted delicious with the naan/roti we had - all were equally good but I particular enjoyed the labni - not too heavy (babaganuj was a little too oily and tabule was overwhelmed with the taste of parsley sometimes)

Cauliflower - flash fried cauliflower finished with a touch of tahini
What is this black magic of flash frying vegetables?  I would like to learn it so that I can make every single vegetable taste as good as this.  It didn't even taste like cauliflower, that's how good it was.

Kefta - skewers of ground mixed lamb and beef with onions, parsley, garlic and spices
Rice was freakin' perfect.  Kefta itself was perfect.  I felt so fat after eating two skewers but no regret, none

Ma'anek -- lebanese spicy sausage; ground beef with Middle Eastern spices and pine nuts 
They're just good.  I feel like lebanese anything tastes good.  This Middle Eastern culinary magic is too real."}
{"text":"Really awesome food! Lots of flavour and a nice change to the restraunts where I live."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd rate Tabule closer to a 3.5.

I've been to Tabule a number of times. I had visited a few times for lunch a couple of months after it had opened and, at the time, the service did not match the food.  Since I've returned, they've made great improvements to wait times and Tabule has become one of my go-to places in the neighbourhood, especially when trying to avoid any of the overly-abundant Italian restaurants that have taken over Yonge-Eglinton.

I don't feel that there is anything spectacular or particularly inventive on the menu, however the food is always flavourful and fresh.  The dining room is packed for dinner service on any given night and the wait staff have been prompt and friendly. Water glasses are always topped-up and quality-checks are performed throughout the meal. Since I've been 6 or 7 times now, I can confirm that the level of service has remained consistent.

They do pour water from an Ibrik which is kind cool the first few times but it becomes a bit too much of a production each time they fill a glass.  After a while, I'd just prefer a regular jug of water.

Apparently Tabule has belly dancers on certain nights of the week. I haven't been present for this, but I'm sure it only adds to the Middle-Eastern flair.

--We also had Tabule do some light catering for a small work function. They provided an excellent spread and so I would definitely recommend it to cater certain functions."}
{"text":"I've only gotten pickup from this place. 

They make the best falafel in the city; nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The rice with roasted vegetables is filling and flavourful. My order is always ready when they say it will be and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"One of the reasons we picked Tabule for our second anniversary dinner was that I knew for sure they would let us BYOW. I used their online reservation system the night before and asked what the corkage fee was. They called me back today to confirm the reservation and that corkage was free on Monday and Tuesday. Win! So after work, off we went with one of the remaining bottles of wine from our wedding reception. (See my review of Millwood Wine Works. This stuff keeps getting better.) 

At a quarter after 7 the restaurant was packed and pretty loud. The reservation was a good idea. Everyone was in there, from families with little kids to coworkers having drinks to snoogly romantic couples. The decor is pretty, cozy and neutral coloured with jeweltone lamps and other Middle-Eastern-esque accents.

Our appetizers were labni (the yogurty creamy cheese dip) and maane (spicy beef sausages). Both were very tasty, especially the sausages, which were intense little chewy things that seemed to have something like nutmeg or clove in them. Don't be afraid to finish your pita bread, because they'll keep bringing baskets of it. Then again, don't fill up on it, because you want to be able to keep eating.

My dinner was shrimp in a tomato garlic sauce, and hubby's was barbecued lamb. The one little problem happened here -- initially I got the dry grilled shrimp when I'd ordered the ones with the sauce, and when I got the right one (very quickly -- the server just took it back to the kitchen to have the sauce put on it) the server came back with a bowl containing two more shrimp and more sauce. Seems my plate did not contain all the shrimp it was supposed to. I wouldn't have noticed, there were six or eight in there and they were huge. Oh, and the waitress came back to tell us about the missing shrimp, after we got them. Everyone was very attentive, as busy as they were.

I keep seeing the word 'fresh' repeated in the reviews, and everything is indeed fresh. The veggies are perfect, charred and softened a little bit. I'm used to Middle Eastern food being a little too oily and a little too vinegary, but everything here was perfectly balanced. Nothing was too bland and nothing was too spicy. 

For dessert we had baklava (hubby initially wanted rice pudding, but they were all out by the time we ordered dessert around 9 pm) and mühalabiya. The latter is a very light eggy custard topped with crystallized sugar, pistachio, and rose syrup. I can't resist rose syrup and I'm glad I went for this stuff. 

Overall, without beverages (because we brought our own wine), the three course dinner plus tax and tip came to around eighty dollars for us both. If you want to feel like you're having a fancy dinner without having to pay too much or dress up too much, Tabülè will do you right."}
{"text":"Great food but okay service. Our server only came back once to refill our water; these little things mean a lot to me. 

The cocktail was out of ths world! Falafel was superb- soft and moist on the inside and crunchy on  the outside. The fish though was lacklustre and not worth the +$20"}
{"text":"This place was jammed for a Saturday nite. Even though we had reservations we still will waited for 25 minutes (kinda defeats the purpose of a reservation). The service was both rushed & slow all at once. Our server broke off twice while she was taking our order to serve another table, odd! 

The food was only good. We were given a appie cause we waited for our reservation. The appie was very tasty. Humans, Tabouli, pita, delicious. My main was the Chickenpox and rice. The Chicken was over cooked & the overall meal temp was too cold for me to enjoy the meal. I'd go to this place again but at a different time of the day. 3* from me."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite middle eastern  restaurant. Food is always good, cooked to perfection and prices are not bad. I have tried many items on their menu and keep coming back every winterlicious and summerlicious for the good value $18 lunch. This review will be based on this year's winterlicious experience. 
To start i had the combination plate, which is one major reason why I love Lebanese food. It consists of babaganuj, hummus, tabule and falafel (my absolute favourites, all served on one plate), with freshly baked pita bread. The flavours are soooo good! And I mean finger licking good! For entré i chose the chicken tawuk. All their mains are served with a side of rice and salad. I've tried many of their dishes but the tawuk and the beef and lamb skewers are two favourites. Everything was cooked to perfection. Meet was moist and tender and had good seasoning. 
For dessert I had the Knaffa Asta. I had no clue what this was when I ordered it but I wanted to try it and did not regret as it was very tasty! It consists of some kind of soft sweet pudding and also has a layer of crispy vermicelli noodles. All topped with a sweet honey syrup. 
Overall the meal was very good. Rated on the meal alone I would give this place 5 stars. However, for winterlicious I'm expecting to see new items on the menu. This is the restaurant's chance to try out new ideas, new recipes and get feedback from their customers. That's how most restaurants do it in my opinion. As this is a favourite place I try coming here for every winterlicious/summerlicious and with that said I would love to see some new items on the menu. Why not change it up a little Tabule?? For this reason I give Tabule 4 stars for this particular food experience."}
{"text":"A very special middle eastern restaurant, the design is lovely, the staff are welcoming, the atmosphere is good, and the food is delicious.
My only take on this llace is that it s a bit overpriced.
I have been here twice, I've tried many items there, i loved the Tabule, the falafel, the grilled hallomi cheese salad, the hummus and mutable.
As for the mains i enjoyed the kofta with tomato sauce, but i thought the lamb skewers dish was way too dry.
I was there with my friends twice and I would recommend you to go thhere and try all that with some arak."}
{"text":"4 stars for food

We had lunch with the family today for Mother's Day at the Yonge St. location. Food was great especially the lamb chops that I ordered. The meat was so tender and seasoning was right on the spot. The rest of the group also enjoyed their food. They had salmon kebabs, red snapper, garlic shrimp and kefta banadura. The cold platter combination that we ordered for appetizer was also superb. We had the combination of hummus, babaganuj and tabule with fresh baked bread. Even the kids enjoyed their watermelon lemonade and jallab lemonade. 

3 stars for service

Service was so-so. There were times that the service was great and there were others that the servers just seems very clumsy. I love my coffee so I did not appreciate when the server hurriedly poured my Lebanese coffee without care into my cup. Overall, it's not terrible but I expected a little more especially being there the minute they opened and before the restaurant got filled. 

1 star for ambiance ... or lack of ambient light, that is. 

This is where this restaurant gets a very bad mark. The lighting is terrible! So terrible that we had to turn on the flashlight on the phone to read the menu! Believe me, the lighting on the way down to the washroom was so bright that I felt like looking at the sun. And that's not because the lights there are bright, it's just too damn dark in the tables. Maybe this is how it is in the Mediterranean region. If so, I apologize. If not, add a little more over-head ambient lights."}
{"text":"Love middle eastern food!! Came here at an odd time for late lunch/early dinner. Place was empty but lots of reserved tables.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and they were all so amazing. The falafels were BOMB!! It's a must try.

Maybe it was because the place was empty? But our food came super quick, less than 10 minutes. Our server was lovely too."}
{"text":"Tabule's patio is always packed, the atmosphere is warm, but service and food disappointed.

The platter of 3 cold apps is a decent deal at $13 for a long plate; we chose hummos, baba ganoush, and lebanese cream cheese yoghurt. The hummus was a bit starchy-tasting for my preference, the baba was nothing to write home about, and the cream cheese stuff was heavy. 

The falafel was great-- served hot. Best part of the meal. 

We were sitting with our appetizer plate a good 40 minutes before it was cleared (and still hadn't gotten our mineral water). We figured they forgot we existed, and conspired to get the check with only the apps that had been delivered. Finally they arrived to clear the table to deliver the main course.

The kefta was pretty good-- a bit dry-- but the rice was sadly inedible for a gluten-free person-- it had noodles interspersed. That meant the server hadn't listened when I stated dietary restrictions. 

Our mineral water came near the end of our meal.

I would go back here only if having a major falafel craving!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Have been to this location twice now, ordered the same app (platter with hummus, babahganouj, gluten-free tabouli and a side of gluten-free laffa. For the entrée, fried falafel (there's a baked option too) with mujadara and grilled veggies. I meant to take a photo but gobbled up half before I remmebered. Took the other half home. 

This time I finally was able to try the vegan rice pudding... It did not disappoint. 

Overall I think this restaurant is delicious, there are a good number of vegan and gluten free options. Their food was well-seasoned and hearty. Huge portion with the entrée.  Went with a few meat eaters previously who enjoyed themselves as well."}
{"text":"Tabule is on an unassuming strip of real estate that doesn't get too much foot traffic - on Yonge, south of Eglinton but north of Davisville.  I'm a firm believer that this stretch of Yonge houses the better restaurants in the Yonge and Eglinton neighbourhood, but none is quite as good as Tabule.   I love everything about this place.  Firstly, the food.  Quite simply, its incredibly tasty, while still being healthy.  Everything is so flavourful and fresh.  My family is from the middle east, and I dont get food that tastes this good unless I am back visiting people in the middle east (I've gone with people from the middle east and they said that it tastes like home - there cant be a more rave review than that).  Secondly, the decor sets an ambiance that transports you off of Yonge street into a corner cafe in a side alley in a souk someplace exotic.  Thirdly, the service is great; attentive but not overly so, yet always making sure that your water glass is full (and the way they pour it is so fun!).  GO TRY THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad.

Don't go for lunch because it's a different experience. They cut out too many things.
I've been there a lot by virtue of working in the area and having one of my good friends stay in the area.


If you want to have a good time, this is the formula: 

Go on a monday or tuesday when you can bring your own wine for free.
If in a group, order a shit load of appetizers and try everything (for every one person, order 1.25 appetizers). Then share a bunch of entrees, at a ratio of about 2/3rd the number of people.
This way, you will each spend about $30 but you will be stuffed and have tried so many different things. 
This has been the winning formula in my experience. 
  
Service is good, fun, cool water service, nice at night!

oh and for dessert, you have to order the Knaffa ana. Normally this dish is made with warm cheese, but i ventured out and tried their version with 
cream and rose syrup and it blew my mind.

p.s LCBO is jut down the street south on yonge!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. Everybody was happy with what they ordered. We had the falafel entree $14, salmon kabab $19, chicken kabob $19, and lamb chop $27. Would definitely go back for the food. The prices were good for the quality, portions were good, and the service was so so. We came here for a birthday and had told them that when making the reservation. They said they give out a slice of cake for birthdays but they never brought it out."}
{"text":"Has great food and a great feel to the place.  My only complaint was that there is nothing like a basic \"platter\" dish for one person which has chicken, rice, hummus, and the usual sides, so it was hard to order what I wanted for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite Lebanese spot! The food at Tabule is fresh and absolutely delicious. The meat melts in your mouth and everything is flavoured and spiced to absolute perfection.

The ambience of the restaurant is wonderful, perfect for a laid back date night..catch up with a friend..family dinner or after work social. The water vessels are super cool and the staff can be seen utilizing them like absolute pros...definitely adds to the authenticity of the place.

My one gripe is that they are heavy handed with the salt and would like to see them use less.

Reina was our waitress and is absolutely wonderful Lady!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality of food. Service was pleasant. Have live belly dancing and music, so entertainment is covered and delightful. Enjoyed the appetizer platter a lot. Good variety of options in menu. 
Definitely want to go back there some time."}
{"text":"We've been going to Tabule for years and often get take-out from this location. The service is always good and they are indulgent when it comes to kids. 

I have a ridiculous amount of allergies and intolerances; Tabule's menu still has a variety of options for someone like me and the kitchen is able to accommodate if substitutions are needed.

The only thing that is a problem is the inaccessible bathrooms. They are down a narrow stairway and there are no alternatives. So, if you need to change children in a stroller or you're in a wheelchair--this is a problem."}
{"text":"I went in to Tabule for dinner and was pleasantly surprised! I had no expectations going in. I ordered the chicken breast and my friend ordered the lamb & beef kebobs, both the dishes were great, tasty and very flavourful. The rice and vegetables served as the sides were very well flavoured, and the vegetables (especially the onions) were juicy and grilled beautifully.

I didn't get to try any deserts since I was so full. However, I will be going back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I needed delivery and looked up some places and these guys delivered so I thought I'd give it a shot. 

Pretty tasty food at a decent value. The beef was a bit dried out but decent. Everything was a bit too salty. 

The arugula salad had wilted pieces of arugula, which was rather disappointing. The fried cheese that came on it was tasty but very salty.

The pickles were gross and tasted like sodium benzoate, a food preservative with a strong flavour found in some foods. I'm sensitive to stuff like that, so the pickles included were a waste, though they came unexpectedly so it's kind of like a bonus item gone wrong.

Overall, it was good enough but I'd think twice before ordering takeout again. On the plus side, they said it'd take an hour and it came in about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"On one particular night recentlly, I happenned to be driving up Yonge Street on my way to my house in the burbs. As I usually do, i was looking at all of the various stores and restaurants that are littered on either side of Yonge. It was on this ride, that I noticed the very welcoming inner lights of Tabule and it was at that point I made a mental note to visit YELP and see what fellow yelpers had to say about this place before I went.

The reviews as you can tell, do not hold back.This place is all that you read, and then some.

All I can say is reserve, reserve, reserve. Especially if your going on a Saturday night ( the night with belly dancers!). This place is very cozy, and as a result not much space to hang around. We were promptly greeted by the servers and seated. Service at this place is expectional, try to not get hypnotized by the server pouring your water.

The food was simply delightful. This place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Went there during Winterlicious. The food was very good. Very tasty falafels. A little light on the portions for my liking but still very good. 

The one problem I had was that they really packed people in there like sardines. Because of this, the waiters were never around or available which really put a downer on the night."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last Saturday night. The restaurant is larger than it appears. It has a u-shape and there are more tables around the corner. Our server was very efficient and nice. My glass of water never went unfilled. I ordered the red snapper, and it was divine! The fish was well made. The grilled veggies that came with it though, were burnt. Regardless, I would return and sample another dish and a cocktail."}
{"text":"I would estimate that I frequent Middle Eastern restaurants less often than those offering most other cuisines. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at Tabule. 

The lunch specials are customizable, meaning that you can substitute various side dishes, salads and sauces to suit your preference. I found the meal to be flavourful and fresh, though the portions were not particularly huge. The staff were very friendly and my friend and I did not feel hassled as we spent the afternoon catching up. 

Overall, would definitely recommend Tabule for a quick, fresh lunch spot when in midtown."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but I can't understand the buzz around it... Mezzes are ok, but only bad restaurants do them wrong. Taboule is cut thinly but not enough lemony (and not enough salty), and would taste nicer if served with large scaroll or lettuce leaves. Entrees are ok as well but menu lacks multiple other classics of Lebanese cuisine. Prices are totally decent and you will leave full for sure. I'd love them to have an more upscale option and room as well, and for all the take out and pick up transactions to be dealt with elsewhere than in the middle of seated customers. Overall, a decent place with ok food, but I hope there is still a better Lebanese restaurant in Toronto, not yet known to me... as there are in other big cities."}
{"text":"Great stuff. Slightly expensive, but the food is definitely worth it. The lemonade is fantastic; the vegetables were very fresh, and the babaganoush and hummus were so great.

Get the parsley salad!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Middle Eastern restaurant in Toronto for a while now, so I was really excited when I heard about Tabule and had high hopes. We walked in on a gorgeous Sunday evening and was able to grab a table with no reservation. Service was pretty bad from start to finish; all the servers were running around frantically (which actually began to stress me out at one point), and this one man kept coming around with a strange vessel of water and topping up our glasses in the most dramatic way. Portions here are incredibly generous -- the entree dishes are plenty, I took about half my plate home to have for lunch the next day. I had the babaganuj, the fried eggplant and the falafel entree. Food was pretty average. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again."}
{"text":"If you're indecisive like me, go for the sampler platter. You get hummus, babaganouj, tabule, falafel, and pita for just $10.50! Everything was delicious - I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I had food here about 3 times. The food there is delicious and is not overly drenched in fat and salt like what many restaurants do. The meat could come out dry or juicy depending on the day. I had the Mennonite chicken twice. 

Don't come here expecting an authentic Lebanese food experience. I think if you come with that expectation you will have a low opinion of the place. Accept it for what it is, a Lebanese restaurant that adds a North American influence. 

I highly recommend the kefta in a tomato sauce it was juicy and flavourful! 
I was disappointed by the small Lebanese sausage should've been presented in or with a pomegranate based sauce but the presentation looked sad."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant on a busy Saturday evening for dinner with my hubby and some friends. Good ambience, welcoming waiters and good belly dancer :). I believe she dances every 45 min-1hr ( twice while we were there- approx 2hrs). 
Logistics apart- food was amazing!! Being a vegetarian I had great time and of course good food. 
We would definitely come back again--soon :)"}
{"text":"I got the lamb skewers and my date the beef skewers. We both had rice with veggies, but I had the rice with the lentils (can't remember what they call it). This was more than enough food for me, even without having appetizers, although my date probably could have knocked some back. The lamb was tender and flavourful, the grilled veggies lovely. I tried the beef too, it was juicy and perfectly cooked to the request of medium.
The service was friendly and quick, the place was packed, so I was glad we had made reservations. As an extra bonus there is belly dancing on a Saturday evening. That was great. Try not to slap your date (like the woman beside us did) cos he looks too long a the dancer, she's a performer, that's the point. It's okay to get mad if he slips a tip in her top!
We both had dessert, he the baklava (which had him making a \"too delicious for words\" face) and I had the custard with rosewater which was wonderful. There is some gluten-free info on the menu, the waiter knew what else was gluten free and I felt there were lots of choices for my gluten-free needs. That includes the traditional liqueur that has the flavour of anise, worth trying as it's something a little different.
If you are looking for consistently good food (I've been there many times for lunch) in a relaxed and classy environment and enjoy middle eastern food, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been trying to explore new places for food options, and we came upon to this Middle Eastern cuisine. I normally go to Villa Madina, when I crave for the parsley salad (Tabule). So I decided to try it in this restaurant, and it was alright, I like the one from Villa Madina better. However, my friends introduced me to Babaganuj and Labni, these two items were better than I expected. I ate so much of this with the warm pita they served.  For my main course I ordered Kefta and it was pretty good, but it took pretty long. The environment in this restaurant was pretty dark, it was a nice place for date nights, but not really for someplace for a group of people to catch up. Another thing I did not like was how they poured the water. It was unique, but water got all over the place so if anyone of you go, do not put your phone on the table.

Service: 3.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Environment: 2.5/5

Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"Ellie A. took me here after a sordid afternoon at Barley's Angels courtesy of Yelp.  We were famished (okay, okay - maybe just me) & this place knocked my socks off.  Service was so friendly, that thing they do when they pour the water made me stay super hydrated, & the food was prompt and delicious.  DELICIOUS.

It's probably not cool that I subtracted a star because they're not located near me.  Sigh.  They can do magical things with eggplant."}
{"text":"We regularly come here, hence this visit was more disappointing. 

The  tabule was terrible, the soup came without the usual chips and the mezze platter was served for three without the plates for each of the three of us. 

Then a large group came in and to accomodate them we were moved, when the entire restaurant was almost empty."}
{"text":"I love that tabule has vegan options and every time I come here, they never disappoint. Came here with M on a \"double date\". Everyone thought that their food was flavourful and the portions would good. I had the falafel salad which came with 7 falafels balls. M had some sort of shrimp dish with rice and he hates rice but he almost finished his place (that has got to mean something). The server was very attentive and very friendly. This place is always packed so I do recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"I love middle eastern food and this is a solid location for it but not among my favourites. 

To start, the ambiance is dark and feels a bit like a cafeteria.  There isn't anything that makes the space feel special.  Secondly, the food while good just isn't that exciting.  The hummas, baba ganoush, falafels and pita were OK but i can't say they stand out.  I liked the service but overall would go back for a work lunch because of proximity but wouldn't seek it out again otherwise."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with Tabule on Yonge. I've been to the Queen West location, and my experience there was the complete opposite. While the food was decent, the service was just not satisfactory. I had to keep summoning the servers to get water, to get any sort of attention, which is clearly not what you would expect when you're paying a substantial amount of money for your dinner. These are the things I think Tabule Yonge can improve on:
1. Give equal importance to all your patrons - I don't know how a big / established restaurant like Tabule manages to ignore certain patrons
2. It took more than 45 minutes for the food to arrive. Seriously?
3. What I got on my plate was 80% rice and 20% chicken. I am Asian and I like rice, but c'mon, I can make that rice at home! Not paying the big bucks for rice. The Queen West location seems so much better, in comparison. Maybe the chef was having a bad day.

I really didn't want to give this review, but I guess I was unhappy enough to do it. I took a guest visiting Toronto over there, and that wasn't the impression I wanted them to leave Toronto with."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the entertainment (belly dancing) too!  Had the jumbo shrimp entree (delish!); chicken was moist and tasty."}
{"text":"This is a really cool middle eastern restaurant. Space is a tiny bit cramped for how busy it always is, but the ambience is superb. The servers also do this cool thing where they raise the water jugs as they pour. They probably hate that they have to do that but I was entertained. As for the food, I had the falafel plate. Falafels can be very hit or miss, especially when they are dry. These falafels were fine, and the rest of the plate was alright as well, but very filling. Overall a pleasant experience that I would try again."}
