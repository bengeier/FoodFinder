{"text":"Food was crap. Everything tasted the same. Like they have one universal sauce. Service was decent. Won ton soup suckd. Broth with one won ton. No vegetables. Wont eat here again"}
{"text":"Lotus is my FAVORITE Chinese food in the Henderson area...It is the only place I will eat Chinese food! I recommend it to everyone. It is clean and friendly and quite. Very child friendly as I have 2 kids. And the price is reasonable. The food is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Bland, greasy, uninspired Chinese food... dark and dated atmosphere... no quality for price paid."}
{"text":"The food here is great and the service is fast and friendly.  There are a variety of choices and the prices are reasonable (\"Dinner combo\" served anytime includes soup, steamed or fried rice, wonton, egg roll and a generous portion of the main dish) for $9-$11.  The place is a dive and the atmosphere is dated.  Still, if you're in the mood for delicious Chinese food, this is it."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! First off I ordered coffee and it was burnt, stale, and cold as if it was warmed up from yesterday. Then after we order our food my daughter had to use the restroom and that was absolutely disgusting I wouldn't let her touch anything in there and there was still urine in one of the toilets. So then we get our food and everything tastes like day old and reheated! The rice was dry and hard. The chow mein was also dry and hard. The only thing that was good was the egg drop soup which was kind of bland but still good and the egg roll. I would never recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I ate lunch at the Lotus for the first time about a week ago. The food was really good. I had the curry chicken and my husband and I shared an order of the egg foo young.  The place was empty when we were there but it looks like it can get busy. The portions are huge so be prepared to take home the extra. The service was great. We plan on going back again and again."}
{"text":"Our family have been customers for over 20 years. Loved the family atmosphere, the food & service was great. We moved 50 miles away but when in the area, we stopped by. Same friendly faces. About 2 years ago, we noticed the portions were a lot smaller, which was ok because they gave a lot to start with. The food that time was definitely sub-standard. We were shocked. It was Luke warm & tasted left over. I was so afraid we would get sick. Thank goodness we didn't, but we have never been back since."}
{"text":"I really wanted to order from here but could not as there is no menu online and when you call them, they don't have a fax or any way to get a menu to you.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've personally been coming to The Lotus since it was opened in 1992. I love the food, I love the workers, & I love the owner. The egg flower soup is the best part. My brother & I will ONLY come to The Lotus when we're sick for their egg flower soup. If you haven't tried this place or haven't liked it, well then you're missing out."}
{"text":"Lotus is one of my favorite places to eat. It is where I go when I want something familiar that tastes good.  When I am sick I want ONLY their won ton soup. (I swear it has healing properties)  But when it all comes down to it I order one of three dishes... Mongolian beef... sweet and spicy chicken OR lemon chicken. SO GOOD. 
Sometimes the service is a bit slow ... but what I love is that it is like being Norm walking into Cheers... 
They recognize you ask you about your family and make you feel very welcome. 
Yeah the interior is a little outdated but this is a bad economy who wants to spend the money on decor when you can spend it in the quality of the food?
The appetizers are good ... the meals are good ... and the service is always sweet."}
{"text":"This is my girlfriend's favorite restaurant so we went there for her birthday today for lunch. I can't believe what a great value the food is. The food was delicious there was lots of it a good selection of lunch specials and the service was excellent. I even got a great fortune cookie"}
{"text":"I go here all the way from California.  the sweet and spicy chicken is out of this world.  we go on Sunday's after church and there is maybe a couple tables that are occupied.  So the service is great! and the prices are so right on, I brought my granddaughter here and they where so nice to her, sometimes food place can snub children.  this is the place to go if you are ever in Henederson look it up."}
{"text":"Went there with the girl for dinner twice. Lunch twice. Had something new each time. It was good, We had the lunch specials. They were great."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the decor but it tells you what kind of place it is. Quick, cheep, Chinese food. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was pretty good. Their lunch specials are cheep and you get quite a bit of food for your buck. The waitress was very nice and noticed that I was dehydrated so she was very quick with refills. It was a good experience but barely a memorable one. I would eat there again but I'd have to be driving by it to probably even think of it."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed with their food.  It is very flavorful.  They ambiance needs some work but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I could have ranked this higher but it just didn't seem to be anywhere near the Chinese food I've had in the past.  Food was decent and the restaurant looked like it needed remodeling several decades ago.  Portion sizes were big but taste was...meh"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed many a lunch with great friends here. Why lunch? It's half the price of their dinners, duh! While their dinners can be a bit pricy for college students, you can't ask for a better lunch deal.

The crispies and sweet and sour sauce they give you are a delicious appetizer and I've never had anything bad on the menu. It's all been delicious.

I don't understand what decor has much to do with delicious food. Good hole-in-the-walls normally could do with a face lift. The place is very clean and the staff is always very nice and polite. My only complaint is that the service does indeed run a little slow. My friends and I can usually count on the place being empty when we go, but the service is still as slow as if it was packed! However, this does give a us a great chance to catch up and chat.

If you're looking for great food and a relaxed, not rushed lunch, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner here for the first time and have to say it was enjoyable. We did combo dinner plates to try out a few things, eggrolls and wonton soup were take them or leave them but our entrees were good."}
{"text":"When I say that the decor reminds me of something one one find at a Best Western cafe in Tonapah, I am by no means hating.  I remembered a more Chinese type of flare during my last visit, but that was a long time ago I reckon.

The service was friendly and while I did not particularly dig my \"General\" chicken, the GF's chow mein was pretty damn good.

See tips for the lunch special."}
{"text":"The portions are large and the food good quality.  The atmosphere is older and needs some updating.   It is a nice stop if you're wanting to eat on water Street."}
{"text":"First, the only complaint our table had was that the waitress brought us an extra tea cup and she reached over the food of us.  It would have been preferred that she went around to the guy who asked for the tea cup. Other than that, this would be considered one of the best Chinese places in Henderson to me.  They are open until 9.  I got the pork fried rice and it was only 5.50, it does come with bean sprouts and onions so if you don't like that just say none please.  There was enough left over for lunch the next day.  They have tons of different dinner specials that were no more than 10 bucks a plate, and it came with the main entree, tea, soup, rice and egg roll.  That was tons of food.  My table had the garlic beef, egg foo young, sweet & sour chicken and ribs. Everyone enjoyed the food and said it was much better than the strip mall chinese food."}
{"text":"Not happy the food was bland ,rice was bland. The service was great but the decor is from the 80's. Will not return"}
{"text":"With mom's cooking days now gone, I've begun a serious hunt for yum yum for the tum tum eats in Henderson. 

Chinese being one of the top 3 favorites cuisine I inquired if good Chinese was even a possibility in Henderson. I was told it was at Lotus.

I ventured in with a buddy of mine who was visiting from San Francisco (expecting him to know Chinese, but he is in reality and cowboy so he is only so-so on Chinese)

I had the cashew chicken and though it is traditionally not made spicy at Lotus the waitress made me happy when she said she could have the cook do spicy. Yen Ching, number one restaurant for Chinese in deKalb,  will not have to worry about me taking the bride to Henderson. Though the spice was nice, there was something missing.

As for my buddy the cowboy, he wasn't very happy with his steak as it was thin and they did not follow his instructions to put jalepeno peppers and mushrooms on the steak while cooking it. But I myself would not go to Chinese to get a 5 star steak, nor a 4, probably not a 3 either, but even though I didn't ask him I think my buddy would be gracious in giving it 1..


The going out the door on Lotus is I'll return but will bring my lovely bride and instead of Chinese take the cowboy to a real steak house like Le Bistro Cafe in Boulder City"}
{"text":"Visited this place for a quick lunch. BIG MISTAKE!!
Haven't been here in some time but suspect it may be under new ownership. The place is filthy and the manager???? thought it was funny that there were bugs in my water and on the lemons commenting that I was \" getting extra protein \" from them. I have since learned from a person that works in the courthouse downtown that  in the past this place was shut down by the board of health!! YUK !! Apparently it was closed and board of health stickers were placed on the door. Sure wish I knew that before eating there. I will occasionally give a restaurant a second chance for food or service issues but not on health issues. STAY AWAY !!!!"}
{"text":"amazing service and delivery! food was awesome! I loved it! great place to order delivery from downtown. good coffee too!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since I was little- and it's been delicious for all of these years!! Love this restaurant! Their egg flower soup is amazing, and their entrees are cheap but so good! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Now THIS is chinese food! Who cares about the outdated decor, all I see is a grade A posted up, issued by the health department, which translates into 'get ready to GRUB' for me.

 I went with 2 men and a 6 year old. We ordered 7 main dishes-a variety of chow mein, shrimp, beef and chicken. The waitress was pleasant and even offered suggestions on some of her favorite dishes.  There wasn't much food left once we dug in. It was that good.

 Every dish was simply amazing. 'Authentic', hole in the wall chinese food at its best. Drinks were always filled, and food was on par.

 A highlight for me? THEY DELIVER. Even if they didn't, the drive is less than 5 minutes for me. I can safely drive home even after overfilling myself and am in a food coma."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem one of the best Chinese spots in town  better then PF Changs in quality and value."}
{"text":"I came here today after going to china town and getting a bunch of goodies.For a appitizer i got the cream cheese puffs.I've not seen any one menchin that they don thave any green onions like most places,wich makes me happy becuase i dont like it when they do have that.For my mean i got sweet and spicy chicken with no veggies,chicken chow mein with no veggies.It was all very good and very tasty just like usual the only thing i do have  to say is that the chicken in the chow mein tasted kind of funny...not sure why.Other then that ill defently be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fucken HORRIBLE!!!!! holy shit food is slop service is retarded and the food is bland I'm sitting here right now with my family I wish I would have went to Subway or some shit do yourself a favor and DONT EVER EVER EVER EVER COME TO THIS SHIT HOLE !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually come to Lotus for their great lunch specials.  The lunch specials start at $5.50.  You get soup, entree, egg roll and rice.  The rice you get with the lunch special is plain fried rice.  It is ok but the fried rice off the menu is much better.  I've gotten take out a few times after work.  We usually go for the basics wonton or egg drop soup, fried rice, chow mein, sweet and sour chicken.  We've always been happy with it.  Service is friendly.  Food comes out quick even when they are busy.  The restaurant is dated inside but I don't mind.  We don't need them redecorating and raising the prices."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall Chinese Restaurant. Upon arrival of this restaurant it may seem like its not that great, little do they know the food was awesome! Me and my friend had the lunch special which was less then $6 with taxes and you can't go wrong with that. 

I had the sweet & sour chicken which was delish and you can tell there was no MSG. Most Chinese places I've been to in Vegas was okay. This place is a must if you're in Henderson. I will defenitly be back!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find Chinese that is similar to back home, Seattle. We found out here! We've been coming here for years now. The service is always amazing. Family owned. We get the pork fried rice, sweet & sour chicken & pot stickers. Always good!"}
{"text":"They were nice and never had sizzling rice soup before actually pretty good. I don't think I would be returning here. It was average Chinese food outside of the hot sizzling rice soup."}
{"text":"We tried The Lotus and found it to be, while a friendly and capable chinese food joint, simply derivative. The food was hot, served quickly, but lacking in character or flavor. The mongolian beef was served sweet in a thick sauce more reminiscent of something that you would find on a McRib sandwich.  My date's mushroom foo young was left unfinished, she found it generally unappealing; she said that the mushroom sauce had an odd flavor.

We prefer the Sam-Pan just down Water Street, if anything for the expended vegetarian menu choices and the friendlier atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome locally owned and run Chinese restaurant, I've been going for years and have never been disappointed. Their lunch specials are very well priced and the food is well done. I highly recommend lotus to anyone who is looking for good food on a budget."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Lotus restaurant since I was a little kid growing up in Henderson. It has been consistent and good for years!  If you want a good atmosphere with good service an fantastic egg rolls, check out the Lotus!"}
{"text":"One thing I miss about Henderson, great food, Egg Flower soup, mongolion beef.  Nice Atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice little Chinese restaurant, right in the heart of Water Street district. It's cozy, and the staff was super nice when my girlfriend and I went the other night. We both got combination dinner meals and they were both pretty good. 
    We must of gone on a slow day cause we were the only people in there but food was still good. Would probably go back again."}
{"text":"The food..is not fresh..
The pork had an old taste..the soup..smelled like cat urine..
No atmosphere..outdated..
Bathroom disgusting!!"}
{"text":"You can't trust and find really good \"hole in the wall\" places like this one. If your like me. IM REALLY skeptical about Chinese cuisine..especially at places like this. We ate here this past wknd 1/26/13 and WOW, it was the BOMB!!! experience. Very much ABOVE Chinese \"hole-in-the wall\" places. Affordable. Food was just tasty, fresh, and perfect. Our youngest son is a picky eater and when he ordered the chicken wonton soup and the orange blossom chicken we were shocked. He dosn't like SOUP at all and doesn't like sweet stuff, but he killed both of the dishes. I don't like fried rice anywhere, but their rice was good. Try the house special fried rice. Really good. We are definately satisfied customer and will definately become \"regular customers\". Can't wait to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Watch out if you want delivery from The Lotus. I have had delivery from them twice without incident. But apparently they only offer it some days?? I just tried to place an order for delivery and was told the driver was off today."}
{"text":"Just stopped here to get a quick bite to eat for dinner while my dog is getting groomed. Good value, good portions, friendly staff. Always have had consistency with their food taste presentation for the past three years so I figured they deserve a good review."}
{"text":"Well, we had not eaten at the Lotus for a few years; after seeing no food trucks at \"Last Friday\" on the Henderson Events Plaza, we decided to give Lotus a try.

Service was good, fast and attentive.

Food: nothing to really return for...
It was good, but lacking -

Won Ton Soup: just that; broth and won tons. We are used to some veggies, maybe a few 'scarps' of meat.
Sweet & Sour (Chicken and Pork: again just plain. The S&S sauce was typical and good. The Pork was a bit overcooked. No Veggies: Where is the pineapple hiding, no onion, peppers or carrots.
Fried Rice: lacking veggies and egg. Guess when they say \"Fried Rice\" that is what they mean and what you get.

Dropped from our list of Oriental places; so sorry!"}
{"text":"The place has new owners. Miss the old ones. Service and food will never be the same again."}
{"text":"We came in town for a quiet relaxing stay in our friends home all alone. We had a craving for some Chinese take out. I messaged a cousin who is from this town and she suggested this place!!  The lady on the phone was so sweet and was very nice to talk to! We drove across town to pick it up and it was so worth it!  I waited in the car, which my husband said was probably a good thing because I may not have wanted to stay for dine in lol, but the lady remembered me on the phone and had very nice things to say about me! The food was EXCELLENT!!!  Everything was delicious and we were very satisfied with our meal!  We love us a good Ma & Pa type of dive-take out place to eat and also would rather support local businesses in the community."}
{"text":"The food has always been so good and the service is wonderful.  Lovely little family place. Unfortunately, when we ate there a couple of days ago. The cleanliness left a bit too be desired.  Been going there for years and never had that happen. I would go back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Great dinner and service. Very reasonable menu and I would say one of the only place to eat on water st."}
{"text":"I love the homey feel if this place. Extremely tacky, but in the best way. The staff is extremely nice and courteous every time we visit. The food is tasty, especially the little noodle chips they give you as an appetizer. I just don't have anything bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I will definitely be back. A place to be proud to have in this East side of town. For those who made negative comments about this place I feel very sorry for you, I don't think anything pleases you anyway no matter how hard anyone tries."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. In my opinion, the Chinese restaurant lunch special is one of the best deals around. Why? Because for the same price or even less than a fast food chain, the Chinese lunch special usually includes a delicious entre with soup, fried rice, and sometimes an egg roll. Additionally, the Chinese restaurant lunch special is a chance to become acquainted with a Chinese Restaurant. If the food is delicious at a reasonable price for the lunch special, then the restaurant could be a great place for dinner or a date. Recently, the lunch special reacquainted me with the Lotus, when I took advantage of their lunch special twice recently. 

     The Lotus sits in the heart of historic Henderson in the Water Street District. It is diagonally across from the Eldorado Casino and City Hall. There is a small parking lot adjacent to the venerable building that houses the Lotus. On my visits, I parked in the Eldorado parking lot, cut through the casino and walked the short distance along Water Street to the Lotus. 

    The Lotus lunch special differentiates from several lunch specials on account of the fact that it ends at 3 PM in lieu of 4 PM. Additionally, the Lotus is one of the few Chinese restaurants that I am aware of where the lunch special includes wonton soup. 

   The inside of the Lotus is grander than it appears from Water Street. There are two dining rooms. Both times I  recently visited, there were relatively few people dining inside. Both times the host turned waitress invited me to sit in the dining room to the right. The ambiance is more casual and relaxing than a take out with a few seats. 

   On the two visits, I ordered a different lunch special combination for $5.95. On my first visit, I ordered the beef chow mein soft noodle style. It came with fried rice, an egg roll, crunchy noodles with duck sauce, and wonton soup. The beef chow mein was far better than what China Go Go and some other restaurants use as filler with the entrée. It was far better than a handful of fast food restaurants. On my second visit, I ordered the pepper steak that included the exact sides. The pepper steak was delicious at the same time that it had a unique taste that my taste buds would consider brisket. The wonton soup that came with the meal, complimented the meal. I wish more Chinese restaurants would offer wonton soup instead of the standard soup of the day that is usually egg drop or hot and sour soup. On visit one I complimented the beef chow mein with a Coke and on visit two I complimented the pepper steak with hot tea. With the beverage, tax, and tip; the lunch special totalled out at less than $10.

   The waitress was friendly. I felt more like a guest in a person's living room with a sundry of tables than a diner in a restaurant. My favorite Chinese restaurants are the cozy places where I mentally feel that I am in a living room. Throughout the lunch special, she'd see to it that everything was good. Both times, she'd conclude my visits by saying she hopes I return soon. With a reasonable price for lunch specials that gives you a lot for the same or less price of a fast food chain in addition to good service in a cozy environment it us a possibility that I will return to the Lotus soon."}
{"text":"Disgusting, boring, blah food. With tip and all I dropped $40 on Lotus tonight and I wish I had went to Von's and picked up something from the frozen food section instead. It's hard to mess up Kung Pao chicken but Lotus found a way to crank out the most boring, uninspired Kung Pao I've had in a long time. 

My 2 year old wouldn't touch his vegetable lomein, and the rest of the food we ordered ended up in the trash. 

For my family Lotus is off our list of possible options. We won't be back anytime soon, if ever."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

i come here for the curry puffs. crispy triangles of cheesy curry goodness. they put alot of filling in it and i love it! i hate when some places fold it like tortellini and barely have anything in it. mix some hot chili and soy sauce and im set.

sizzling rice soup: 3 square crispy rice patties placed in your soup right when they serve you. the broth is simple and is not overpowering. mushrooms, chicken, pork, cabbage, and ginger accompany the rice and soup. so yummy and healthy at the same time. the great thing about this soup is that its filling but not in a way where you regret eating everything. so hearty.. makes me want it right now. 

i've tried the egg foo young.. it was... okay.. i had it with pork and the meat was the only thing that had flavor. the gravy didnt taste like anything... mushy nothingness. thumbs down man..

fried rice, mongloian beef, and curry chicken.. nothing special but not bad either..

curry puffs guys!"}
{"text":"Very above average Chinese food.  We had the szechuan meal for 2, which is quite a bit of food.  We did this on purpose, as we wanted to try several items since it was our first time.  The fried rice was of much higher quality that I've had before.  The veggies were clearly fresh, a lot had a \"snap\" or crispness to them.  You could taste the egg and pork in the rice.

The ribs were a winner, although they were messy.  The egg rolls were a bit on the small side, I would want more substance there.  They deliver to our neighborhood, so for future cravings, I won't have to suffer the indignity of leaving my couch.

Excellent, friendly service.  There is a parking lot, but it's small, only a few spaces, and it's a tight fit.  Wish we had more places like this on Water Street."}
{"text":"This place has been a part of Henderson for as long as I can remember. It's a little \"hole in the wall\" place in the Downtown Henderson area, but if you go there, and you like Chinese food, you shouldn't be disappointed.

Lotus has a large, diverse menu of assorted Chinese dishes. Beef, pork, chicken, duck - you name it, they've got it on the menu. I don't think I have ever dined here and not enjoyed my food. During my visit last night I had the Hot and Sour Soup and the Spicy Salt Chicken (a daily special item) - both of which were excellent.

The atmosphere inside isn't half bad either. The place is well-decorated, and never overly loud, even when there are a lot of guests dining. The staff are friendly and always around to make sure you have enough to drink.

The complaints I have with Lotus are minor. First and foremost, often they ask to see my ID when paying with a debit/credit card. I understand that this is for security/safety reasons, but the fact of the matter is that no other dine-in restaurant does this - and I find it more annoying than helpful. Secondly, the menu does not have pictures of descriptions of the items. People who aren't religiously fans of Chinese food aren't going to know what a lot of these things are. This place could really take a hint from Grand China, who DOES include item summaries and pictures in their menu. 

All in all, Lotus is a damn good Chinese dining experience. They have been around longer than just about all of the competition - and with good reason. No Chinese food fan should be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this spot on good old Water street! I've been here several times and it's always good. Joel and I enjoy coming for Lotus's lunch menu. It's a super good deal. You get soup, plus entree with rice and an egg roll for $5.50! Not only is it cheap it tastes yummy. The egg drop soup has a rich flavor. I love the egg rolls they are always crisp and don't flake all over when you bite into it. 

I switch it up when it comes to the entrees. The Mongolian Beef has a perfect spice. They have excellent Chow Mein and it doesn't matter if you get the pork, beef or chicken it's all good. The Moo Goo Gi Pan is also one of my favorites with all the veggies. The rice they serve with it has lots of garlic flavor which I always dig. 

The ambiance isn't the best, but the tasty food makes up for it. Plus, our waitress is always friendly and always keeps our drinks filled. The food comes out in quick amount of time and the soup is never scalding like in some places. You can tell all their ingredients are very fresh and they take pride in the presentation. 

If your in old Henderson make sure you check out this small, but tasty restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local Chinese joints. The dining room is straight out of the 70's and reminds me of  restaurants in San Francisco's Chinatown. My favorite dishes here are the Crab Won Ton, Dry Chow Fun and crispy duck. While I usually order take out, they have some interesting specialty drinks that make dining in quite fun as well.  They are located right across the street from the Henderson Events Plaza Amphitheatre so it's a great place to duck in when enjoying downtown events."}
{"text":"I spent Mother's Day in the middle of Water St handing out Yelp buttons and Yelpsticks. This demanding work required sustenance, and I am lucky to have a husband who was willing to spread the Yelp gospel and retrieve food. He has the perfect skills to be a festival sidekick, primarily seeking out value lunches.

I did not get to check out the interior of Lotus or experience the service first hand. My experience was limited to a lunch special in a styrofoam container. They did mess up my husband's order the first time, and he had to walk back. I had veggie lo mein, fried rice and an egg roll-- a carb trio. They skimped on the veggies in both the noodles and the rice, but the flavor was okay, neither greasy or salty.

The meal was not spectacular; it may have been even a bit less than a-ok. However, the lunch special makes up for the culinary shortcomings. The price: $4 and change. Wa-POW. That's a cheap one."}
{"text":"About the worst Chinese food I have ever had..!! And I've had it all over the country..!!
I ordered the dinner combination special. First off the Wonton soup had no flavor, no vegetables, no shredded pork, only a weak broth and 2 shriveled up dry wantons. The type of crunchy noodles they serve come out of a can.
The fried wonton I got had nothing inside..!!
The egg roll was really a spring roll and the oil it was cooked in was dripping off all over my hands.
The sweet and sour pork was not good. What meat there was was either chewy or fatty. The fried rice was dry with no flavor and nothing in it..!
The only reason I gave it two stars was the service which was OK.! Not worth it at even half the price..!!"}
{"text":"It's just ok... I'm from California. We have better Chinese food everywhere.  I most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5 people including me...

Did a family style ordering, getting things like O.C., General Tao's, egg rolls, rice dishes, etc.

Service was fast and everything was piping hot.

No lie, the best orange chicken I have ever had!!!

Kicker, everyone ate and was full, and the cost was just over 30$! Amazing"}
{"text":"Dude, lotus is so bomb. In the middle of water street and almost hidden amongst all of the buildings, is the complete gem. Parking is pretty easy, but can be a mess because it's so limited and it shares it with other businesses. This place is old Henderson, through and through. The inside isn't for glamour- it's a type of Chinese restaurant with the decor that you'd expect, a bit like the 90's with a lot of light pinks. But the food is so worth it. I'm not too much of a fan of fried rice but this is my absolute favorite. It's packed with so much flavor and seems so easily prepped. I've tried a couple things off the menu- my favorite is always their version of the honey walnut shrimp. PS large groups with the family dinners get so much food for such a great price point it really doesn't seem fair. And the lunch specials include a cup of soup, an egg roll, your entree, and fried rice. And for like $5. Crazy good! Stop by at Lotus, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great lunch special.  When you don't want to drive all the way to chinatown for some good chinese food this is the place to go.  People seem to miss things on water street and this is something you shouldn't miss.  Great prices and fast service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 15 years. My wife and I had our first date here. I USED to love this place, until last night. I will never go back until i forget about this...

You know the food is bad when you take most of it home to feed it to your dogs.....

This isnt a troll post at all! This an honest post. I cant imagine eating worse food! And Ive had some bad suhsi and burnt lemon grass fish....this tops it!"}
{"text":"Any time I am not feeling well, I like to head over to the lotus for a bowl of egg-drop soup and crispy noodles! The soup is hot and thick, just the remedy for a sore throat or when you are feeling under the weather. The soup honestly has magical properties.

This place is an outdated Chinese Restaraunt but the food is good. The decor is horrible, lol, but I don't come here to look at walls. 

Although it isn't PF Changs, the service is good and the food is made to order."}
{"text":"I love Lotus. It is my favorite Chinese restaurant so far. I have been here at least a dozen times over the past 10 years and it's fantastic. I usually one of a few different dishes when I go there.

This last trip 2 days ago was with my husband and we ate inside the restaurant instead of taking it home. The restaurant is definitely in need of some updates, but it is always clean inside.

They have the best pot stickers in the entire valley btw. They are cooked perfectly, the dipping sauce....omg. I'm drooling right now thinking about them. AND most important to me is no onions. Try the pot stickers when you go, you won't regret it. 

They take your order right away or at least acknowledge you immediately. They also give you crunchy noodles to munch on while you wait and always make sure your glass is full.

I ordered the dinner sweet and sour chicken, which comes with hot tea (you have to request it), wonton (or egg drop) soup, rice (I got fried), and an egg roll. I usually have a hard time finding restaurants that serve fried rice without onions, but the Lotus does not add them (hooray!). Good portions, the right amount of crisp in the sweet and sour chicken, and the wonton soup is fantastic. My husband always gets the Mongolian beef and it has just the right amount of sauce and spice. This does have onions but is easy to pick through (or order without). 

They have never messed up an order whether we eat there or call in to go. Located in downtown Henderson in Water St. They have very little turn over and friendly staff. Check it out."}
{"text":"Been there twice. The first time I ordered take out and the food was good. The second time I ate there. Booth seats are worn and you sink. The silverware is cheep and super worn kind of made me wonder why they don't buy new silverware The water taste like bleach. I rather take out"}
{"text":"Now that I work in the Water street district It was time to try new places for lunch. I ordered the wor won ton soup and it was delicious. Almost as good Golden Buddha's wor won ton soup back In the Bay Area...(oh how I miss the BAY) Any how the soup was tasty, not too salty and loaded with meats and vegetables. I ordered to go and it was a 10 minute wait. not long at all. Customer service is friendly. I will definitely be coming bak here for my Wor won ton soup fix. I may try something else next time!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! First you get Crunchy Noodles with Sweet & Sour Sauce.  I had Walnut Shrimp with a delectable sweet mayo sauce on a bed of crispy cellophane noodles.  My wife had Shrimp Chop Suey combination with Won Ton Soup, Fried Rice and an Egg Roll.  Nothing was disappointing.  A gem in a small town atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have one word to say about their bland tasting soup having, over sweetened and cornstarched flavored, no veggies in their fried rice having, eggroll having hardly any filling tasting $5.99 lunch special is...#Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"The service is good, the food is good. Thee's a little bit of a wait period, but it's not as bad as other places."}
{"text":"Ahhh the Lotus. An old-Henderson must! The service is fast and friendly. They have good specials and decent food. Don't go here if you are looking for a 5 star place. Go here if you want a great casual dinning experience with greasy American-Chinese food and a sweet little Chinese waitress who will say, \"Ah yes, ok, ok, dank you.\" It's not racist - I adore her!"}
