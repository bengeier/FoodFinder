{"text":"I have  given  this  place  3 tries within 2 years and  am always  disappointed with  the generals chicken. Not  spicy and  over cooked with  little flavor. And  why would  you  call your  restaurant fortune cookie and  not give them with every meal????? Have not  gotten  one  yet. Will not be  going  back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here dozens of times, dine-in, take-out, and ordered delivery, and I've never been disappointed. Tried probably half the menu, and I've yet to find a stinker. My go-to is the Crispy Scallion Chicken w/Lo Mein, with the Beef Chow Fun being another stand out."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quick service; friendly staff; good food and cheap lunch specials. I believe it's family operated which I also love. My dad and I frequent this restaurant for take-out and they always treat us with kindness and respect."}
{"text":"Last night I ordered steamed dumplings, wings and Kung Pao chicken.  Best dumplings ever.. not too heavy, great sauce and very flavorful.  The wings had that good marinated flavor and were nice and hot on delivery, as with everything else.  The Kung Pao chicken was beautiful and delicious.  Very generous portion with plenty of red peppers and mushrooms.  I never order it because I wasn't willing to try a dish with peanuts in it but it WORKS.   I have a new favorite dish!  Delivery was prompt and professional.  Driver was neat, groomed and very polite.  Be sure to tip a couple ofdollars.. reward good service!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant around. Food is always cooked perfectly, and comes out fast. Delivery is also fast. The order is always right, staff is very nice. Try the crab rangoons!"}
{"text":"First time ordering food from here.   The food did come hot and the delivery guy was very nice.   But unfortunately the food was subpar at best.   The beef with broccoli had hardly any flavor to it, the pork fried rice was \"ok\", I ordered fried dumplings that were soggy and the egg roll I think was twice cooked and the beef teriyaki was the biggest disappointment.  The beef teriyaki was as dry and as tough as beef jerky and I'll add the picture of the minuscule skewers it came with for the $5.45 that I paid for it.
Super disappointed and won't be ordering from them again..."}
{"text":"Ordered for the 1st time online. BeyondtheMenus allowed me to easily order with adding & deleting things to my \"cart\" for my order after signing up. Food came quickly. He had to be at my door in 20-25 minutes. Nice guy! Food was hot, and presented nicely. Now I'm funny about my Chinese food. Being half Asian I know good Chinese food and only thought up north (NJ & NY) had good Chinese food. My mom who rarely eats American Chinese food said it was good. Wow! I'd order again from here."}
{"text":"This place is less than a half mile over from me yet I have never made it into the actual restaurant. I have been in my apartment for a little over a year now and tried out a couple of Chinese delivery places within delivery range near me. I wasn't impressed with any so I kept changing around. Finally, I found Fortune Cookie and haven't ordered from another since.

My go-to is the Honey Chicken. It is so good and always super crispy. They have awesome fried chicken wings too. I like their steamed dumplings and get those on a regular basis. I also enjoyed the steak on a stick type appetizer, several of the soups (egg drop wonton and hot&sour). I have had one or two things I didn't really care for but that's expected. You aren't going to like everything on the menu at any restaurant!


The food itself is always warm. They always include plasticware and enough sauces. They have online ordering which is convenient. The service itself is always friendly and they always deliver within the time they say they will. It has been 9 months of consistent good service. 

As far as the negative review because of the MSG, I don't know anything about whether or not it's in their food. I don't even know much about what MSG is. However, I do know that Chinese restaurants are notorious for using MSG. I don't think that should be a negative unless you asked and they mislead you about it. 

If you try out Fortune Cookie I don't think you'll be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Typically I have no issues from this place but today my order was prepared incorrectly and just downright BLAND! I called to complain and was given the run around by the woman in the phone. Needless to say I won't be back! Wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. We've been here several times for take out. The food is delicious and plenty. The staff is really nice and they recognized me on my second visit(!!). Great prices too!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The vegetable egg fu young is incredible! Totally recommend you trying it!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to give this place a chance. Ordered a small meal online. I live less than 4 miles away from this place, and it took them over an hour and 15 minutes for them to deliver. Won't be ordering from them again when FURTHER places come in half the time."}
{"text":"I had a very horrible experience at this restaurant. The owner was very rude and came off very cold towards me, but with other customers. Customers who ordered their food after me were served before me. Definitely not a minority friendly restaurant. And the food is sub par."}
{"text":"Plentiful serving of Chinese and Vegetable for a great price.  Good spring rolls and never have to wait in line upon entering."}
{"text":"I ordered the sesame chicken dinner combo with fried rice and an egg roll. The fried rice was just plain rice, no eggs, no vegetables.  There was zero flavor to th fried rice. The sesame chicken also had no flavor and the only thing that made it sesame was the sesame seeds sprinkled on too.  The egg roll wasn't too bad but still didn't have much flavor but had a nice crisp to it. Won't waste my money here again"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch 3 days ago and I'm just now able to get downstairs at my house due to food poisoning from the chicken and broccoli.  I'm am in the process of reporting them to the nc authorities.  This place needs to be shut down. Worst night of my life."}
{"text":"We were really hoping that this would be a good place to order delivery from.  Unfortunately, we were wrong.  The soups were incredibly diluted and watery.  The potstickers were tiny but didn't taste awful.  The Mongolian beef was the worst I have ever had.  It was rubbery, full of watered down sauce and tasted old and cheap.  The general tso's chicken was okay, but lacked sauce so it all stuck together and was overly chewy.  It was a rainy day around rush hour but we live not far away and it took over an hour to deliver the food.  Really unfortunate.  We will not be re-ordering from Fortune Cookies."}
{"text":"One of the best in town.  We loved the general to chicken, so good... Its a bit on the high price but its delicious, we order delivery and literally takes them 2 minutes to arrive, sooo good."}
{"text":"Online ordering and delivery is always awesome, especially for those days you just don't feel like going out. Their delivery is prompt and the food arrives piping hot and relatively tasty. The prices are event reasonable.
The problem? I think the food is totally laden with MSG. That'll be the last time I eat food from here. I had just a few bites of food and a few hours later I realize that I've drank about 40oz of water and my tongue still feels dry, and I've got the headache from hell.
To be fair MSG affects everybody differently and I'm pretty sensitive to it. Order at your own risk. Their egg rolls are pretty good."}
{"text":"Tried this place for shrimp fried rice - was good. Went to try something different today - shrimp with vegetables. It was tasteless and awful. Called to ask what can be done - they asked to bring the food back??!! Wtf?! NEVER going back there again!"}
