{"text":"The food was tasty.  We had wings and the perch dinner with our beer.  The waitress sucked big time.  She was the only server we saw, but the few times she came to our table she was not very pleasant or personable.  She never even introduced herself, just dropped the menus asked what we wanted then went back and stood behind the bar watching tv for the next 12 minutes.  The whole time we were there she only came to the table 6 times in almost 2 hours.  I've never had to wait so long for wings in my life.  We were the only ones at a table and there were only 3, yes THREE, other customers at the bar.  I can't imagine what the wait would be if the place was busy.  I highly doubt I'll ever go back here.  The food was good, but for the amount you get way over priced for a dive bar."}
{"text":"Homemade meatloaf special is awesome. Great food during the day corner bar feel. Night club feel at night. Awesome place to go whether you are looking for a quality lunch or good cocktail."}
