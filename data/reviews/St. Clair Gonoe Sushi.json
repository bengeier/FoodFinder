{"text":"MMmmmm reasonably priced, relaxed atmosphere, good service and beautiful looking delcious food!

They don't have as many varieties of specialty seafoods like Japango, but their creative menu is a little more extensive than most local sushi restaurant.  Other than the usual dynamite rolls and red dragons, they have re-invented them a little bit with deep fried spicy salmon roll or the Gonoe teriyaki rolls topped with jalapeno peppers and seared rare sirloin!  The roll's consistency was so well maintained, they ensured each roll only has exactly one round of jalapeno of specific propotion. It is the first time my friends and I have all declared that such ideas are executed supurbly. 

Prices are very reasonable for what we were eating.  The portions are a little more delicate, so it may take 2 rolls (avg price $8-15) to make it feel like dinner.

We got a private booth and the waiters were quite attentive.  It's such a nice sit-down place we ended up staying for over 2 hours and ordering a second round of food.

We'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality of food, prices a little high, and customer service was half decent.

I visited this venue with m'lady with a group deal voucher. They asked me to provide it to them before ordering, which was fine. The server tried steering us in a direction with the food so that we would be within the amount that the voucher covered. I would've had no problem going over, as I ended up doing a little.

When we were seated, I had reserved a table. We would've generally preferred a booth but they placed us right in front of the kitchen area, so we were a little uncomfortable as we could feel that the food prep staff kept trying not to look at us.

The food was very fresh and delicious, and the service was initially rather attentive. The problems however came in when I asked for a dessert menu, and the waiter provided me with a green tea ice cream instead, so there was a little bit of a language barrier there. Also, when I was presented my bill, I laid my credit card down. When the waiter came to collect the payment, he asked if I didn't have cash. I told him that I did if he preferred that I pay with cash, so when he told me that he did, I gave him a $10 bill, for which he owed me several cents of change. Since he never returned with my change after waiting an extended period of time at the table, I let him keep my change as a tip since it seemed to me like he was trying to tip himself instead of providing me with my change and getting a larger tip. I am not a fan of people trying to tip themselves like this.

So all-in-all, considering the prices were a bit high for a sushi place (on average just about everything was more than $1 per piece of sushi), and  the service was iffy at times, I'm not likely to return to this venue. On the other hand, the food was indeed great, so if there is improvement done on the service, I would be much more likely to return and update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Terrible!  Went to eat here with a group coupon purchased. When we got there they wouldn't honour it.  The manager said that because they are not receiving cheques from the group coupon site, they are no longer honouring the deal with customers.  

The manager stated this very matter of factly as if this isn't his problem at all, and it was our problem because we purchased a group coupon.  

I understand they might be having a problem with the group coupon site, however that is not my fault, and because of this interaction, I'll never eat at this restaurant again.   The manager did not try to help out in anyway or offer any sort of solution.

I just wish there was a little more respect for the customers that did not know nor are in any way involved in the business dealings between this restaurant, and the group coupon site."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great space, entirely reasonable prices.  I have nothing bad to say except it's a shame I can't eat here all the time."}
