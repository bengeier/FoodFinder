{"text":"The newest location on Queen St. near Airport Rd. was terrible. Realizing they only opened 2 weeks ago, I thought they would have at least some things organized by now. The wait to be seated was atrocious, we could see empty tables but ppl weren't being seated, mass confusion. Once they finally seated us they forgot to give us utensils. Waitress messed up my order and gave me an omelette instead of the skillet, I ordered; its kind of hard to screw it up bcoz I asked for my eggs over medium. I took the omelette bcoz we were both so hungry from waiting so long. The shredded potatoes were cold, we had to ask for creamers, sugar, water and a refill on our coffee, unbelievable! Don't waste your money here, after paying over $33.00 for 2 breakfasts, we couldn't believe it. Go to Mongos up the street on Queen, its faster, bigger portions and half the price."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Really liked old location and service.  Ate at new one and will never go back.  Food took forever to come out and it was cold and sad looking. Sent our meals back and they come back worse then before.  When we complained we were offered free water. Wait staff looked rushed and unhappy with new management. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"What's there to say. It's Denny's. The foods not awful, but not great either. It works in a pinch after a night of bar hopping."}
{"text":"I am at Denny's Mississauga almost every week after midnight (who wants to cook after midnight) and i love the ambience and food.   Went to the Brampton location on a tuesday after 2am cause it is closer to my boyfriend's place. On entering you can feel a sad vibe and there is no music. The place was clearly understaffed with just one waiter and he was struggling to serve 4-5 full tables. He was ever nice and asked us to pick our own spot but he forgot about us for 30 minutes. Then on request came with the menu and we promptly ordered. Im vegetarian but i like the skillet which has sausages n eggs cause it has cheese and asked him to serve the eggs and meat separately so my bfn can scarf it down.  My bf ordered fish and fries. Both were served beautifully and the taste was consistent with the ones we have had at the Mississauga place.   Overall good experience but just a little lacking in ambience or i came on an off night. ==================================PRIYA==="}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant to eat at for breakfast. My girlfriend and I usually come here for spontaneous dates when we are feeling breakfast foods. We usually just get the cinnamon pancake breakfast which consists of the pancake, eggs, bacon or sausages and their infamous hash browns. Drinks wise I just recently got into their strawberry- mango lemonade pucker thing, lol and my girlfriendjust completely loves their coffee. Totally the best spot to chill, talk and catch up. It is a cheap way to get your breakfast fix, 10/10"}
{"text":"Ordered a BYO Grand Slam and coffee which I thought included the (pumpkin pecan) pancakes and sausage - Didn't realize that the sausage was extra, or that there was an up-charge for the pecan pancakes - Came to $17.02 after tax for eggs, two pancakes, one sausage, and a coffee - Can't afford to come back - No wonder the place was virtually empty"}
{"text":"Yes. Denny's. Big whoop, right?  Well, I admit that I love this Denny's. In the past, I've experienced some pretty bad nights in other locations, but this one has always been pretty consistent.  I'm a big breakfast guy, so I've pretty well had everything on their breakfast menu, and the only things I think is not quite up to snuff are their sausage links. Their burgers are also very delicious, as are their sandwiches.  In terms of service, I've only had one bad night ever with a server who I haven't seen since, so that guy just sucks, and I'm choosing to believe that that whole night was just a bad dream. Every other time the servers have been more than nice, helpful, and prompt with the food/drinks.  This location also happens to be located around several alcohol-pushing establishments, so it's a great 24 hour option to end the night with a good meal."}
{"text":"Service is SLOOOOOOW at best. Took ten (10!!) minutes to get a drink refill and our waitress only had three tables!! She also was uninterested in the customers and had zero personality (not a requirement for the job, but hey at least let the customer THINK you are having a semi-decent day). I guess all the cars in the parking lot were from diners at Indulge Burger or Jersy Mikes. The chain has tried to up their food choices and quality in part by offering sizzling skillets. I ordered one and there was not one sizzle to be heard besides the sizzle in my mouth from the INSANELY spicy sausage. I couldn't eat it, and might I add nowhere on the menu did it mention it was even slightly spicy. I could have breathed fire...  I guess there's a reason why you're half empty on a Sunday morning - will never go there again. Ugh."}
{"text":"Well it's Denny's so my expectations wasn't that high.  Not bad late night hunger..."}
{"text":"This is no ordinary Denny's!  Whether it's the stereotypical drunk Scottsdale douches fighting in the restaurant or wasted skanks having diarrhea in the parking lot, this Denny's is guaranteed to entertain. I've witnessed some crazy and disturbing shit (literally) at this place while enjoying a Denny's Bacon Slam Burger and chocolate shake at 2am after a night out at the the Dogg or Ernie's. I'll only eat at this Denny's.  All other Denny's simply aren't worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. Some of the servers seem grumpy and are not friendly at all. However, sometimes you'll get a friendly server. The food itself is good and there's a wide variety .    They have free slams for your birthday which is nice. It is a kid-friendly environment. I like that it's open 24 hours. The wait times vary depending on the time you go and what you order. The dining environment is dated and needs a makeover badly. It looks a little dingy and unclean most of the time. There is Wi-Fi if I remember correctly. Overall it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"THAT'S RIGHT...I'm reviewing a Denny's!  LOL.  Let me just begin by saying, I don't drink, and I was at this Denny's at 2:30 AM after the bars closed in Old Town, and it was still pretty damn good...which says something for a Denny's!    The server, A.J. was a really chill dude, with a really laid back vibe, despite having drunken debauchery run rampant around him.  He still provided great service, and dealt with the wide array of patrons that were there at that hour.    I was really impressed, having been in the night club industry a lot many years ago, and having frequented late night spots to eat, and being horribly disappointed that this place was not only staffed well but also cooked well at that hour.  So much so, I felt compelled to Yelp a freakin' Denny's...that's saying something."}
{"text":"So its a rainy Sunday, I am totally hungover and the husband is hungry. I say there is a box of mac and cheese in the cupboard...or we can go to Denny's. We haven't been to Dennys since we discovered Matt's Big Breakfast about 4 years ago.   There were about 5 other groups ahead of us, yet we only waited maybe all of 5 minutes. We were seated quickly and our server was there pretty fast. We knew what we wanted so we put our total order in. Our food came out quick, and I cant really complain, it is Denny's after all... what do you expect?   Well, the table to the right of us must have thought they were at Ruth's Chris, cause they sure as hell were acting like it. 3 rather well behave little girls, a very old man, and the mother with her rather exposed bosom's and talking as loud as she could. She sent back THREE different plates of food. She ordered a side salad, and then complain about that quality of it as they were charging her \"$3 for this little salad\" When the server told her it was only $1.99 she shut her trap, apparently $1 make a difference when you are dealing with salads and ghetto people.   Our lunch was good, but having to sit next to these people and endure her asinine complaining really brought down our rainy Sunday lunch. I felt sooo bad for the waitress, but she never snapped at this woman, she took it like a champ.   Anyway...its Denny's you go here when you are hungover, not for a high class meal."}
{"text":"Straight up, the service is one of the best I've experienced at any such chain food joint. The food is well, Denny's classics. Great pancakes, eggs (made as you like) love the meat grilled platters. I must admit the chicken avocado burgers were delicious. Just had their Bacon Burger.. It was a tad sweeter than I'd like but nothing a bunch of hot sauce won't fix! If I had to pick a couple of things among the tons others, they have fantastic hot chocolate and their shakes (yes chocolate again) are absolutely delicious!   Last but not least, I think I've only been to Denny's once when it was light out, felt so weird! Only feels right when it's pitch dark outside!"}
{"text":"One of our usual spots for Sunday Breakfast.  Although the service and the food has been good over the last couple of years, lately it has degraded.  Much so that I have to give it a 2 star review.  We arrived at 1:35 pm for a late lunch/breakfast on a Sunday.  We were quickly seated with menus and told our server would be with us in a minute.  The restaurant had about 8 tables ranging from 2-4 people per each table.  Our section had 3 waitress, so it looked like the servers were not in the weeds (busy).  We proceeded to look at our menus and decided what we wanted...we waited...and waited...all this time watching servers pass our tables with food, drinks..etc.  Upon the 20 min mark, I promptly got up and found the manager on duty. I told her of the situation and we sat down, lo and behold...our server arrives ( who we saw earlier, checking on tables and dropping off food).  We ordered from the seasonal Christmas menu (BTW the Grilled Turkey Dip sandwich is awesome).  Our food came out quickly, but on my entree the Turkey Dip should have come with gravy to \"Dip\".  I told her that she forgot the gravy and she promptly replied...\"It doesn't come with gravy, you have to order that separately\"  I responded that \"Its called a Turkey Dip for a reason..please check your menu\" She left to check and in about 2 min I had gravy.  The rest of the service was good, thanks to the manager who came to check on us and apologized. The manager gave us a free dessert and comped our drinks for our issues.  Our server came by and apologized as well, after talking to the manager and our server we still left satisfied our issues were dealt with.  We will still come back to Denny's, but more care is needed on the guest service and timings on the floor."}
{"text":"I like this location more than others in the area, it is warmer than the location on Dunlap and I-17.  I enjoy reading the newspaper while drinking a cup of coffee and having breakfast.  Denny's cant screw breakfast up and I really enjoy their coffee so I am a fan.  This place has been there for years so it is a little run down, I have never had a problem with service here and the wi-fi is great as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now, and I have to say, it's not half bad.  Sometimes I want to sit down and have a decent breakfast without driving to far, and this place is close to my apartment. Plus, with all the light rail construction going on, getting around is kind of tough these days, so I stop in here from time to time.  The last few times I've been here I've gotten the moon over my hammy.  Since I don't eat pork, their kind enough to switch out the ham and put turkey on instead.  Service here is quick, and the few times I've been in here, I've never had much of a wait.  Yes, I know it's a chain, but it's honestly not half bad here. I've never had a bad experience, and the food is decent.  They also have 2 hours of free wifi if you should need it."}
{"text":"it awful, dirty, and food is gross and not cooked!!!!!!it is not clean!!!!They do not clean tables, or replace items, they leave left over food on forks, glasses dirty, place is gross."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours with minimal choices of entrees to pick from the menu. Not cool when you're out late...drinking like a fish and dancing till your feet hurt. After a good night out, I'm expecting something that will hit the spot and make me sleep like a baby after. Don't come here if that's  exactly what you're looking for.   Too bad there's really no late night spots in the valley. This is the time when I really miss New Yorks street vendors with ridiculous lines at 3am or Chinatown where you can eat to your hearts content & fall asleep in the back seat while someones driving you home or the diners where the menu is filled with so much choices but guaranteed a hearty meal or.....  What a disappointment"}
