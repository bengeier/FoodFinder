{"text":"Terrible tapas!!! Tasted like canned food. But the service was good, and the mojitos were tasty, hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"I would like to start out by saying that before eating here, I had never had tapas, small plates, Spanish cuisine, or left the US. Still, our waitress, although a little inexperienced, was incredibly sweet and took the time to explain everything we didn't understand (which was a lot). 

We started off with some salmon montadito (basically Spanish bruschetta) which was recommended by our waitress, and we were certainly not disappointed. They were awesome. The fish tasted fresh and the portions were good enough that I didn't feel too bad about paying $7 for two slices of bread with meat and veggies on them. 

Then we got the pollo a la mancha (chicken and chorizo in white wine and a salsa) with papa leonesa and mixed vegetables (entrees come with two sides). My girlfriend got the eggplant parmigiana with rice and beans and that was all equally excellent. 

On a return trip we got the chicken paella and zandrus salad. Both were awesome. (Our same waitress also seemed to now be a pro at serving, and just as cool as ever). 

Again, we've never been to Spain, but my American taste buds give this place rave reviews."}
{"text":"Great drinks! We just got the Spanish combination since we didn't want to be too stuffed but we were so glad we did! It was so delicious. The bar tender really knew how to mix a drink"}
{"text":"We were walking down State Street and passed Zandru's. It was new, we like tapas, so why not?

The patio outside was nearly full but it was almost empty and air-conditioned inside. So we opted for the latter. The restaurant is basically a rectangle w/booths down one side, the bar on the other and tables in between. So we had a great view of the bar area. Our waiter was incredibly friendly. He told us it was his first day. I give him kudos.

We ordered beverages to start, a mojito and a martini. This is where the comedy begins.

After putting in our drink order, our waiter eventually returned to let us know our drinks were in progress and to take our food order. He was happy to make recommendations and suggestions. We opted for the casserole Zandru's, the gallician-style octopus, and the sauteed calamari.

Time passed. We began to wonder about our drinks. We noticed the bartender sometimes wondering outside, sometimes at the bar. He seemed perhaps confused. Our waiter arrived with white sangria. He apologized for the wait, told us our drinks were coming but that the bartender had only started a few days ago and told us the sangrias were on the house. We had the impression this was an on-going problem. I can't say the sangria was particularly good. Some of the fruit in it looked pretty battered but I did appreciate that our waiter realized there was an issue before we said anything and brought them free of charge.

Eventually our food arrived. (Still no drinks.) It wasn't the prettiest to look at. Everything had kind of a grey cast, but I will say all three dishes were actually very tasty. Despite the color, the flavors were quite good. Our waiter checks up on us and again apologizes about the drinks.

We're done eating. Finally our drinks arrive. Our waiter is again apologetic and we all have to laugh. The drinks were actually good when we got them. When the bill came the drinks were on the house. They had to be right?

It's a new place, there are bound to be problems. I thought our waiter was great. The food was tasty. Yeah, it wasn't pretty and yeah, the drink situation was so ridiculous it was comical. But give it time and Zandru's will hopefully work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal at Zandru's outside last night--highlights were the paella, garlic shrimp and the Spanish tortilla. The staff were helpful and courteous. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to grab a drink after the night market. We sat down and had to wait at least 25 min for someone to even talk to us. We ordered sangria which ended up being 38 dollars. When we finally got our sangria the pitcher was filled with way too much ice and so was our glasses. Now most nice restaurants in Madison 38$ can be equivalent to a decent bottle of wine. What we got was overpriced, ice filled sangria. This whole experience took us about and hour and 15 min. If you like wasting your time this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot, awesome food, finally Madison has tapas that are thoughtful AND tasty! Sweet spot on State street to chill. Totally loved this place. After having tapas in most major US cities it is a relief to have something so special here in Madtown. Paella is great, drinks awesome and happy hour too! A Madison Must!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, several good vegetarian options, and thoughtful service. We stumbled on this place while on our way to a different restaurant and decided to give it a try by just ordering snacks. The restaurant is clean and comfortable inside, although the music was just a touch loud (all hard surfaces in there). I enjoyed a mojito with plenty of fresh lime and mint, and also ordered the garlic-marinara seats, which is a dish of mushrooms with peppers and tomato. The vegetables were bright and flavorful and the bread (drizzled with olive oil and grilled) was delicious. My husband got the casserole Zandru's which he really enjoyed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had a couple of their empanadas, which were delicious. They also have the best mojito I've ever had (sorry Steve). Our server Aaron was very helpful, and I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back here. I have not stopped thinking about the roasted pork montadito and pork mofongo since my visit. The pork on the montadito was impossibly soft and juicy, not at all overcooked and topped with a fresh chimichurri sauce. The pork included in the mofongo was actually South American style chicharrón, or crispy deep fried chunks of pork with lime. If you haven't tried South-American chicharrón before, I highly recommend it. It's the perfect combination of saltiness, lime, and texture. I also ordered the mussels which were covered in a flavorful tomato sauce. 

The restaurant itself was very clean, brightly lit and staff were very attentive. The environment was great and they throw parties every week, if you're into that!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Zandru's on the night of my 21st birthday for drinks and loved it! The staff was very sweet and welcoming, and the girl bartender was fantastic and gave me a wonderful birthday special and whipped up amazing sangrias and margaritas! She even ran out the door to catch me to wish me a happy birthday! It has a fun and unique atmosphere and is very up and coming. I'm excited to see what they will grow into!"}
{"text":"Awesome food selections with healthy portions. Their steak was a little too salty but the tapas were milder and balanced the flavour. Great casual dinner spot"}
{"text":"With only one review in for the new Zandru's, my better half and I chose to throw caution to the wind and try it out.  Next time, I will hold onto it a little tighter as we didn't have the best experience.  For the positives, we were greeted by the manager (a nice touch) and our server was welcoming, upbeat, and attentive.  It definitely felt that she was new to serving as she immediately came to our table asking if we knew what we wanted to drink and then checked back every few minutes until we decided.  Another clue was that she opened our wine bottle without cutting the foil (just pulled the cork through it).  Again, I would rather take an upbeat and nice server than a disgruntled one but she definitely needs more experience and polish.  We decided to order light and opted for the sauteed calamari and the shrimp in garlic sauce.  As my girlfriend lived in Spain and I have traveled there, we thought these dishes would be a good test for the kitchen.  The kitchen earned a D.  For starters, the calamari was listed on the menu as being sauteed in white wine, red pepper, and paprika.  What we received were some deep fried rings with a chunky marinara sauce.  When we brought it up to the server, she mentioned that is how the kitchen always prepares it.  Mistake aside, the fried calamari was just average and for $8, steep for the quality and quantity.  The shrimp were just ok.  The menu describes it as \"full of garlic flavor\" but it was lacking.  The sauce, however, was good to dip our accompanying grilled bread into.
Zandru's is an interesting place and don't know what customer base they are trying to target.  From ever changing color LED rope lighting under the bar and liquor shelf to a featured drink menu that offers a drink with Hypnotiq, it screams for college customers.  But some entrees above $20 and paella (for 2) around $40, one would think they are going for customers with a little more disposable income.  
They have positive staff, which is a start, but they have to smooth out their rough edges.  With some prices scratched out and new ones hand written on the menu to inaccurate food descriptions, they have some things to work on.  Its going to be an uphill climb, I think."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Friendly attentive staff! Delicious tapas! Our host even brought out a few extra samples for us to try to expand the variety of our tapas experience! I would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"So far not impressed. Here for a bachelorette party and we have been here for 45 minutes and no food yet. Asking for drinks. Short staffed. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. We ordered the Gambas Al Ajillo, garlic lime chicken, chicken croquettes, spanish omelet and the orange flan for desert, all of which were delicious. Food portions are quite generous for a tapas restaurant. Drinks were awesome. Great value for money."}
{"text":"Oh, Zandru's. I really wanted to like you, I did. 

To start off, the menu online has way more than the actual, smaller menu we were given. Sad panda. There were some good-looking things on the online menu that I wanted to try.  Zandru's is plunked right in the middle of an area frequented by students, but they're charging $40 for a pitcher of sangria. Their menu portions and prices are very shortsighted for where they're located.

We ordered a few things, and then waited for them to roll in. They arrived all at the same time, which was odd, wince tapas are usually spaced out a bit better than that. We ordered the Spanish Combination, a pork empanada, the pork montadito, and the fried calamari. The calamari was decent--not rubbery like restaurant calamari frequently is. The montadito was boring. Gray pork and onions on top of grilled bread. Bleh. The empanada was mostly hollow, with a tiny bit of filling. Also bleh. The Spanish Combination showed up swimming in very thin orange sauce. It was okay.

I've been to plenty of tapas restaurant, even had tapas in small towns, and my experience was underwhelming. The price was high, the portions were small, and the food wasn't memorable or even that great."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Spanish food!  Friendly service.   Classy setting. Fair and affordable pricing."}
