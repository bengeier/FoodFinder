{"text":"One of the best meal we had in a long gone time. The eat the whole menu is an amazing value, staff is knowledgeable, professional yet friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Booked a table and called back to cancel 20 mins later and told me I would be charged $125 because she refused 4 other calls within the last 20 mins. So was pretty much bullied into going at this point. Arrived and besides two at the bar, we were the only people there. Was so upset I ordered a drink and left. I'm sure the food is decent. Just such a bad experience that I don't see myself ever returning."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here the other week. The food was great and is super veggie friendly. I split the tasting menu with a friend, then we chose our favourite dish to order as a follow-up, that was more than enough food. The brussel sprouts were awesome, I think the celeriac was one of my favourite dishes.  The atmosphere could use some improvement, it was kind of bright, that would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"The food was hit and miss - Brussels sprouts were amazing but $12 for about 6 sprouts is quite ridiculous; squash ravioli was nice but was not hot (barely warm); my friends had the duck ragout and didn't care for it (also served cold). And everything so overpriced! (Including the wine...$15 for a 5 oz glass is bs) If a pasta dish is $23, I assume it's going to be a main, not a starter. So we were all still hungry when we left and went next door for fries. I get that they're doing innovative things with food, but it's not good enough and the space is too unremarkable to justify those prices. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Word of mouth had me thinking this place was going to be a knock-out awesome experience.  After spending $100 per head ordering the entire menu, we found ourselves enjoying only 4 of the 9 dishes, and left hungry.  Super friendly staff, amazing chef, great idea..... but it feels incomplete.  I might not be their target market, but this place needed a more defined identity."}
{"text":"Tried the \"Eat the Menu\" option, and truly, every item was uniquely delicious. It's a long, leisurely experience - or at least it was when we went - so don't plan on being in and out. We were there nearly 3 hours.  Every item was made to order, and looked gorgeous. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and clearly love their creations.   I was torn between a four and five star rating, and am slightly pained to have gone with the 4. The food and service was stellar, but for the price, the portions could have been a little more generous.   Most of the courses were 2-4 bites, and spaced out over the time we were there, we left thinking a few more bites would have been appreciated.  But again, what we got was absolutely lovely. Definitely Recommended."}
{"text":"*vegetarian review* A thoughtful and progressive restaurant. Not only do they have veg items but an entire vegetarian menu. I tried the taste the whole menu option and was enjoyed all the dishes. The mushroom with truffled potato I could eat everyday and the beefsteak tomato was unexpectedly top of my list, brussels being a close second. Oh and that subtle but sweet wild forged ginger ale was a dream. The server was attentive and informed. You could tell he really cared for the place and the food. I will be back, this is likely my new go to dinner spot."}
{"text":"The menu and the concept behind the restaurant made me eager to want to try it. And Despite hearing very mixed reviews, we decided to give it a go.   What a huge disappointment.   We started with cocktails that sounded delicious. A ginger old fashioned and a plum vodka drink. Neither tasted like the description. And were barely drinkable.   We ordered a few dishes based on the serves recommendations:   Pig butter toast  Pork nduja  Mushrooms with deer lichen Duck with cherry   Both the pig dishes were served with toast dripping in butter. Fat on fat.. mmm so good. NOT!   The mushroom dish was sort of flavourless, but wasn't horrible.   Then came the duck. This is the dish that made us decide to leave immediately.  It was horrendous.   Dry, drenched in some salty sweet sauce reminiscent of Chinese take out. We couldn't even taste whether the meat was duck or beef.   My partner and I agreed it is the worst restaurant we have been to this year."}
{"text":"Great Food.  First time going Loka, and wasn't sure what to think as we read the menu, but wonderful surprises with every dish. Unpredictable combinations made for an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and friendly service. We ate everything on the menu, but I could have just as easily eaten about 17 of those pig macs."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals I've had in Toronto.  10 out of 10 as far as the food goes.  Love the food.  I tried taste the menu and was blown away by the flavors. I will be returning when we have visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"If you're looking for top of the line locavore Canadian cuisine, look no farther than Loka. Their totally inventive menu is chock full of local area treasures and rarities, like sea asparagus, deer lichen, and lake fish. Any fans of cured meats should beat a path to Loka's door as the chef/owner is an aficionado who makes his own varieties of salumes, and prosciuttos in house. The staff is warm, friendly, and thoroughly versed in the menu and can steer you right if you need direction. Overall, an excellent culinary experience with bold flavors and sharp inventive pairings."}
{"text":"We happened to just stop by here by chance, the vegetarian menu sign on the board outside caught our eye for the friend that was with us who was a vegetarian.  the location is really nice, the decor, dark woods etc. but to be honest nothing on the menu really caught our eye and we were looking to really eat! we felt kinda bad to pick up and leave so we agreed to just share the salami board (thinking there was cheese on it for our veg friend but nope) with like 4 pieces of bread and 30 something slices of meat. And they were really talking about their house cured meats, but i didnt think it was anything that special   also i think they could tell we wanted to leave and knew we didnt like anything on the menu cause we were kinda whispering and stuff, im not sure if this is what they regularly do but they gave us a complimentary amuse bouche. it was a purple polenta, with goat cheese and small chips, kinda like a super thin kettle chip. and a green sauce of some sort. we thought it was going to be an overdose of flavors but it had zerooooooooooooo taste. like nothing, it was strange! i thought the entire experience was below mediocre. OH AND THE ARTWORK!! i get its a cured meat place, but i realllyyy doubt many people wana stare at pictures of the bloody feet of 20 pigs in a bowl.. that seriously made me lose my appetite. this place is definitely an acquired taste!"}
{"text":"We went for the multi-course tasting menu on Saturday and had a great time.  Dishes ranges from very good up to outstanding.  Owner/chef is a great guy and service from the rest of the staff was great, it's a fun place to eat.  Very pricey to get the tasting menu plus drinks but other than price there is nothing to complain about.  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"It was a nice way to have dinner and enjoy something unique and delicious.  We had the taste the menu ....some courses were better than others"}
{"text":"Loka was an extreme let down. We were very excited to eat at Loka since it was staffed by the famous Dave Mottershall. To our dismay and disappointment, the food was under salted, not well seasoned, and exorbitantly priced for the small portions. The ingredients chosen for each dish sounded creative and interesting, but the integration of them was poor. We were initially excited for each dish that came out, but left unsatisfied as nothing seemed to be properly prepared. The white asparagus in particular was served with a paste so sour that it threw the entire dish off.   Unfortunately, the Globe and Mail review is pretty spot on: the food sounds good, looks good, but doesn't taste good. They also don't have cocktails (which is understandable), but they charged $16 for 1oz. of the Glen Breton scotch served neat. At the time, we didn't know of the price, but after looking up the Glen Breton, we've found that a 750ml bottle costs $79.15. At that original price, 1 oz. sells for around $3. Even with a 300% markup, that means it should sold for $9 (not $16).  If you want \"Canadian Cuisine,\" as Loka advertises itself, you can go to Loka and take some nice photos. Or you can find it elsewhere prepared more skillfully a more reasonable price.   The Globe and Mail Review (which in hindsight is spot-on):   http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/loka-the-food-here-is-instagram-famous-but-looks-can-be-aggrieving/article29493234/  \"I've eaten the chef's cooking three times now, twice at the new spot...It is also barely edible in too many instances - and by this I don't mean it's too beautiful to eat.\""}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have ever been to.  We ordered the full menu and added the salumi board and pig mack.   The chef's attention to detail and complexity of flavors were on point.  Top notch service from our bartender who paired wines with the dinner.  You must go try Loka!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner, and what a great choice! We ordered the beef cheek, char, beets, mushroom, bone marrow, and noodle dish. The mushrooms were SO good with a touch of truffle. The char is also very delicious! These two are not to miss!"}
{"text":"I went here with two friends and we had the tasting menu.  We had a nice time but it's a bit of a weird place to have a tasting menu as it feels a bit like a bar I might have gone to in undergrad. Ambiance  and atmosphere are lacking. In any event, the food was pretty good - the brussel sprouts were particularly delicious. The service was very good and they were able to accommodate a gluten free tasting menu.  It was a bit pricey considering the atmosphere and the contents of the various courses. Overall, I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we have ever had. Thanks to Dave and Angelina for opening this gem of a restaurant. A unique blend of butchery and whole food plant based menu respecting Canadian local produce. Hats off to Loka to accommodating vegans as well as meat lovers. Special care was taken to accommodate food allergies as well."}
{"text":"Ordered the whole menu. Most dishes were good, a couple were very good. If you feel like going to a restaurant very hungry, spending a lot of money and leaving just as hungry, this is your place."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Sat at Chefs table. Great sampling menu. Chef and staff were super friendly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Was OK, we were expecting something a lot better though. Had a mushroom dish, with lichen, was pretty good. But then came this cured beef dish which seemed like they just put a whole bunch of random toppings on it, like they were trying too hard. Wasn't a huge fan of it. And for a place that expensive, the restaurant interior was pretty meh, quite beat up and not impressive at all. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"The \"Smoked Bone Marrow, Quail Egg, Herb Salad\" arrived first and I loved the artisty of the presentation of the plate.  The quail egg was done sunny-side up and so cute among the darker colours of the bone marrow.  I really enjoyed the crunchy pork rinds.  The smoked bone marrow was absolutely delicious though!!  I am a huge fan of bone marrow and this one definitely would consider to be one of the best-tasting ones I have ever had.  The bone marrow inside the segment was fatty, juicy, and more than ample to spread on the crostini.  The herb salad was also just as delicious and was a perfect savory fit with the bone marrow.  Even the herb salad by itself on the crostini was perfection!  Loved this dish!"}
{"text":"Loka is a unique restaurant and perfect if you are a foodie who love to frequently experience new dish creations. They change their menu to reflect the fresh ingredients they have to work with. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable of the dishes when we had questions."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at Loka. Very friendly and attentive servers that know their menus very well. Couldn't decide on which beer to get so our server was kind enough to bring me a couple of samplers. Ended up going with the Sweetgrass Golden Ale, which was light and smooth (and tasted even better when I found out it was on sale at $6 a pint).   For the food, we got the \"taste the whole menu\" meat option, along with an extra side of the mushrooms from the vegetarian menu. The pickled Arctic char was very light and delicious and went well with the crispy leeks. The pig head croquette sounded scary, but it's just pork jowl meat, and was very tasty. The maple glazed pork belly was also very tender and delicious. The mushrooms with truffled potatos was also really good, especially the potatos. The deer lichen that came on top was a little chewy, but interesting to try. Unfortunately the other two dishes weren't that great. The shaved beef neck was way too salty for my taste. Smoked bone marrow also wasn't that great and the hard chip it came with just didn't work, as you can't spread the oily marrow on it. The goat yogurt cake for dessert was quite nice and refreshing.   Sharing a single order of \"taste the entire menu\" along with another side order is a good portion for 2 people with average appetites. I usually have a big appetite, but had a late lunch, so worked out just right.   Overall, most of the dishes were delicious, the beer was great, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere very relaxing. Would definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"Came in with friends for dinner.  Service was great and attentive but the food prices are outrageous based on the food they fed us.  Hardly any meat and very stingy portions.  Drinks were bland and overpriced.  The 3* is really for the service but the food here is overrated. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Do NOT get the sharing menu  Service/Atmosphere (4/5) The reviews on Yelp are so mixed that I figured I would try this place out for myself. I went  last night with a group of 4 at 6:30. When I arrived the place was completely empty but it filled up fast so reservations are probably a good idea. The service was great, the servers were attentive and incredibly knowledgeable about the food. The menus is pretty creative so we had a lot of questions but they were happy to answer them. I don't eat meat and one of the other girls was dairy/gluten free and they were able to accommodate both of us. The food came out pretty slowly but we weren't rushing so it was okay. The only off putting thing for me was that they had pictures of raw meat on the walls which I found pretty unappetizing.   Food (2/5) I had the pan roasted mushrooms with truffle potatoes and deer lichen which was delicious but not worth $19. It was too small to be a main but too large to be an appetizer. There were a million different types of mushrooms in the dish and the potatoes were perfectly mashed and creamy. The deer lichen was definitely interesting but not in a bad way.  One of the couples got the tasting menu to share and for $100 it was NOT worth it. The portions were absolutely tiny. Its really only meant for one person. You would definitely be better off just ordering all the things on the menu that you're interested in. It just wasn't WORTH $100. While there was nothing wrong with the food, it wasn't at all good enough to justify the price."}
{"text":"WInterlicious 2017 dinner ($38)  My boyfriend and I are a huge fan of small local institutions that do farm to table and head to toe food and when we found out about Loka, we were extremely stoked to give it a try. Loka reminded us a little bit of the restaurants we used to eat at in Montreal when we were students: very locally run small restaurants with unassuming decors and simple comforting but elevated foods.   My favourite dish of the night was a play on beets (tasting of garden vegetable) where roasted beets were served in a I believe raspberry vinaigrette with beet chips and greens. The dish was so refreshing, but yet very earthy and decadent.   My second favourite was the shaved lonza was exactly as promised: aged pork very thinly shaved served with a maple cream, picked berries and fried pork rind, so rich and decadent but not over the top fatty.   Overall, the whole dinner was very enjoyable and left us full but not bloated. Service was impeccable as well as the dinning time (we took about 2 hours to eat all three courses, which in my opinion is ideal for these kind of establishments where you come to dine but also to enjoy the company of each other).   Prices of the regular menu are on the pricier side but totally justifiable considering everything is local. We will definitely return and try their $100 tasting menu."}
{"text":"What we ate:  - The whole menu (really! See first pic for a listing of menu items).  Not on the menu was the amuse bouche we started with. It was unreal - artic char tartare with radish and shaved crisp carrots. Every single dish on the menu was worthy, but standout items were definitely the mushrooms and the bone marrow. The cured egg yolk is a baller version of Parmesan. It will blow your mind. Also, service was fantastic. The waiters had outstanding knowledge of the food and were so warm. Try to grab the two counter seats at the very back that overlook the very open kitchen. That will be the best way to watch the chefs work their flavour magic."}
{"text":"Loka is an unassuming establishment from the outside. Upon walking in, you'll notice that it's  a rather bare industrial design with chalkboard walls and photographs of cured meat hung up. You can peer straight into the basic white kitchen under fluorescent lighting and see the busy chefs working away.   Right away you will find the service noteworthy. Your server knows the menu inside out and is eager to tell you about it! \"The Pig Mack\", she explains, \"is the ultimate crowdpleaser.\" Get us two of those, please, you say. And as per usual, you mention that you will be sharing all the dishes including the soup. So, instead of being given 2 spoons, the kitchen serves you each a bowl of delicious potato mussel chowder. What a pleasant surprise!   You notice the care that goes into each item from start to end - from the ingredients to the plating of the dish to the design of the plate that it is being served on. Oh, as well as the way Loka opens your meal: with an amuse-bouche. (1)  /end narrative  Our third dish was the bone marrow which we found to be a tad too salty but not a huge detractor as we really enjoyed the overall experience. I look forward to trying the other items at Loka, especially since this establishment curates a rotating menu. Plus, I missed out on dessert due to my lack of stomach space!   (1) An amuse-bouche, according to wikipedia, is unavailable on the menu, served gratis, prepares the guest for the meal and offers a glimpse into the chef's approach to the art of cuisine"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Saturday, it was absolutely amazing! Started with Salume platter of cured meats, which was just incredible. Couldn't decide on what to order, so we decided to \"eat the menu,\" which meant getting a tasting-sized portion of everything. And everything was absolutely impeccable! Tops were a halibut fritter with beef cheek, and pickled arctic char with watermelon remoulade. We had an extremely reasonable bottle of Nua prosecco ($35) which went well with absolutely everything. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I just got back from a Winterlicious dinner here. The three star rating doesn't earnestly reflect the good mood and efficiency of the entire staff at Loka this evening. A more accurate rating could be given once I get a try of their regular menu. But the overall outcome for the food and atmosphere at tonight's Winterlicious experience deserved to be shared with the rest of the Yelpers on here.  Service was great. I was the last of our group to arrive and when I got inside a happy looking server who also turned out to be our main server for the evening (Duncan) warmly greeted me and let me know where the rest of my dining-mates were sitting. He tended to us for most of the evening although this tasks was also shared by one or two of the other wait staff during a moment when there was peak during the dinner rush. Duncan made our evening at Loka go swell with a few chats over the course of the meal.  The three items I had all shone in their own way. Even the creamy Amuse Bouche had a positive reaction from almost everyone at the table.  The savory taste of the Pickled Arctic Char, the creamy mellow flavor of the Watermelon Remoulade, and the crispy shreds of Leek all worked well together. I flavor of the watermelon wasn't really present in the sauce which was good for my taste and it complimented the taste of the Char.  The Maple Glaze Pork Belly was a winning choice picked by everyone at the table and noone had a complaint about it. The flavor of the maple added just enough sweetness as a counterpart to the flavor and delicate texture of the pork belly.  I savored my Chocolate Brownie which was accompanied by a frothy dollop of Vanilla Goat Yogurt, explaining the sour taste that I experience upon trying abit of it. There was also a chocolate paste serving as a base for the entire ensemble. All three items had a balance of flavors when eaten together, even though I enjoy a brownie on it's own :-)  And in addition, the glazed earthenware bowls in which the amuse bouche and some of the other desserts were served also received positive receptions from the diners at my end of the table, like it was the first time they had seen earthenware of that type of make :-D  A satisfying, straightforward atmosphere with an appealing selection of dishes which agreed with one's tastebuds was what I experienced at Loka this evening."}
{"text":"A spur of the minute decision to dine at this quaint spot with a very cool vibe. The menu offers items so outside the box that it caught my attention immediately. So as not to miss out on anything we opted to go with the $100 tasting menu to share. Each course was presented beautifully and tasted wonderful however the portion sizes were a complete joke at this price point. You would have most definitely received a 4 star from us but really the portion sizes were ridiculous! We went for dinner again afterwards."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a more upscale dinner and I'd heard that Loka was supposed to be good, and so it was that we found ourselves at the restaurant on a Friday night.  I had perused one of their sample menus online and I was planning to take advantage of their \"eat the whole menu\" option, but our waitress dissuaded us by noting that it would make sense if we *each* ordered the whole menu. We ultimately wound up ordering less than we would've had we gone that route yet we paid more. It was bizarre and annoying that our waitress gave us that unnecessary spiel.  Anyway, before the meal even started we were presented with a complimentary amuse bouche. It was a small potato soup that was impressively flavorful. I honestly could've eaten a whole bowl.  We decided to start with the Whipped Smoked Butter + Apple Jam. This turned out to be a pretty fantastic way to start our meal, as the butter, which admittedly isn't that smoky, is rich and creamy and an ideal complement for the tasty apple jam.  Our first course was the Tempura Pickled Ramps + Fiddleheads, Kale-Chi Mayo. This dish pretty much blew us away. These deep-fried items - I'm honestly still not entirely sure what \"ramps\" are - were cooked perfectly and accompanied by that delicious mayo. The plentiful portion was somehow still not enough. So good.  Next up was the White Bass Rilettes, Creamed Cabbage, Fried Sourdough. Again, this was an amazing dish. The pate-like concoction was so rich and flavorful that we wiped it out in no time. (Again, this is despite a rather generous helping.) My one complaint with this dish was that the spread left the Fried Sourdough soggy. Maybe it wasn't brought to our table quickly enough?  Our third course was the weakest: Shaved Lardo, Plum Mostarda, Crumbled Chicharron. The presentation was certainly very appealing and pretty, but in terms of taste and content (and quantity) this dish was seriously lacking. It didn't really have any flavor at all (or it was just too subtle arriving on the heels of two extremely flavorful dishes), and we were ultimately just thankful that the meal didn't end on this lackluster note.  We instead ended with the Cured Venison, Wild Mushroom Ragout, Pumpkin Puree. This was truly a phenomenal dish. There's so much going on here and it all works perfectly together. I wish I were a professional food writer because I just don't have the words to adequately describe how much I loved this dish.  We didn't get dessert but we were presented with a very tasty \"palate cleanser\" that was basically icy ginger and something else that escapes me. It was a perfect way to finish our meal.  I should finally note that while the service was mostly exemplary, we did wait quite a while to receive the bill."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.  Had dinner last night with friends and it was a great evening.   The room is simple and unfussy. The entire staff was friendly and welcoming and interested in making sure that we had the best possible experience.   Mind-blowingly good house-cured meats.  Unusual foraged ingredients. Locally sourced everything.  I highly recommend the \"eat the menu\" option - it's an amazing collection of flavours and textures. And every mouthful was fantastic.  \"Eat the menu\" means you won't miss a thing.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to go here and the ambiance was great and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and funny.  I was very happy until they charged me double for my drinks with my friend. We ended up paying 50$ each for three drinks.  It is too bad because I would have recommended them but I don't like dishonesty.  There are too many great bars in the Queen West area that don't do that to waste my time on one that does.   I'd recommend only going if you are sure to argue your bill."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Loka just by chance. We didn't have reservations for dinner that night and Loka was able to take us in at a last minute's notice. The place itself is simple and the menu has a short list (there's an option to try to the entire menu for $100/person).  We ordered the below dishes for a party of two:  PAN SEARED WHITEFISH CARAMELIZED BRUSSELS SPROUTS LAMB PROSCIUTTO BEEF BRATWURST  All-in-all, the food was very tasty and well presented. The service was very friendly and courteous as well. My only complaint is the portion size of each dish. The bill in total was just over $100 (without tip) and we went away not feeling satisfied... But I imagine that would inflate the tab that much more..."}
{"text":"Out of this world culinary experience last night! Treat yourself to the Chefs pass table and interact with Chef Rouge!"}
{"text":"The decor is extremely simple and reservation is a must. The menu changes daily based on what's available on the day. I was told that the chef asked the farmers to bring him an x amount worth of vegetables or meats, then he will work with whatever he has. He also have a no-waste, nose to tail philosophy so nothing get wasted here.   The house cured meats, pig mack and croquette are permanent items on the menu. The menu isn't extensive, around 10 items including apps and mains. Also, Loka isn't cheap, but I recommend going with a few friends and try their $100 tasting to get everything on the menu. You can also reserve the chef's table in advance to get a full view of the kitchen as well.   Overall I was really impressed with Loka and it's quite possibly one of the best meal I have had in Toronto far (other than Boralia)."}
{"text":"I read about Loka and was excited to try it out. Made a reso for 9:00. They take your credit card and will charge you $25 per person if you don't show up. So I thought it was going to be packed inside. Nope. It was empty. There was one other party and the decor is very simple. I felt nervous that I was going to be trapped.  But the food was really great. For $100 you can try the whole menu (7 dishes) and its great to be shared with someone else. The menu apparently changes all the time but my favorites were:   - Lonza, Maple crema, burnt bread - Pan Roasted Mushrooms, Aligot potatos, Deer lichen - Tasting of Beets  They also have a couple of other items that are not part of the 7 courses. The Pig Mac, which is their take on the big mac and Pig Butter. The pig mac is a slider ($11) that really does taste like a big mac, but is made with pork instead of beef. Only knock on it is that there isn't much meat in it. The pig butter is similar to a pate and was really good...and a great deal for $5.   Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to Loka based on the reviews, but I wish we'd read further into NOT ordering the $100 tasting menu! For that price you are way better off dining at Alo where everything will be delicious, well-timed and perfect. My cousin and her husband asked if it would be sufficient to share the tasting and our server mentioned a lot of people do share it, but it was a meagre amount of food for the price. You would be much better off ordering 4-5 dishes from the menu for the same price and actually having a sufficient amount of food. The wait time between dishes was also too long.   We liked the mushroom dish for its different flavours and textures. Truffle oil is always a win. The bone marrow itself was tasty and the sweetness from the onions in the salad was nice, but the parsley was very overpowering.   Decor: Nothing to write home about, it was pretty plain and unmemorable.  Service: Great.  Dietary Restrictions: Very accommodating for dairy free and vegetarian options.  We left pretty disappointed and went somewhere else to get more food afterwards. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Toronto has some great restaurants but there are a handful that can impress on every dish. Loka is one of those few places. With a perfect balance of creativity and integrity this place has earned a spot in my heart as one of my favorite places in TO."}
{"text":"Loka is known for local and Canadian dishes. One of the O&B restaurants, that lives up to the chain's reputation. Many vegetarian options that are quite flavourful. Prompt and friendly service who explained everything and gave us a complimentary soup like dish to start.  We made reservations online 3 weeks in advance for their winterlicious menu. I ordered the shaved lonza for my appetizer and my friend had the pickled Arctic char. The maple crema was a delicious sweet contrast to the savoury lonza. Of the 2, the arctic char was more memorable, flavourful, and unique. Subtle hints of dill and crispy texture of the leeks. Yet I couldn't figure out where the watermelon flavouring went.   For the main, we both had the maple glazed pork belly. My pork was slightly tough but my friend found hers very tender. It came with black beans and boiled beets.  For dessert I had the brownie which was delicious! The goat yogurt was very light and slightly sour, but the perfect combo for the sweet brownie. The granite was actually made with strawberries and not the advertised candied peaches. It was the consistency of shaved ice but slightly melted.  Chill atmosphere, not a lot of people so noise wasn't an issue and really unique pairings in their dishes. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"What to say about Loka.  I was very interested in the concept and am fairly adventurous when it comes to food. I'm breaking my review down into three parts. By the way three of us dined.  Decor/ambiance. - very basic. Nothing to see .  I would say rustic.  I don't this is the place I would take a date if I was out to impress someone.  Not bad not good. 3 stars  Waitstaff - they were so nice and earnest.  It was a shame that all that enthusiasm was not reflected by the kitchen. 2 hours for dinner with wait times between 20-30 mins between plates was too long.  By the time we got to the last plates we were full and sick of sitting there. Again, the staff was fantastic.  Not a place to go if you are looking for a quick bite. We had a total of six plates plus a shared dish.  I could not imagine sitting there for the try everything menu. It had to be close to 4 hours.  Price for three with a bottle of (75) and three beers was $350.    Food. We received an amuse bouche of a fish tartare, it was salty and fairly good. I would never order it, but it was decent. We loved the pig butter, very interesting. The bread was fantastic.  Potato and muscle chowder but good but not hot enough. It was tepid at best.  The cod Tongue was tasty but was nothing more that fish fingers. I've had better but it was good.  The mushrooms with the deer lichen was a big hit.  Very very tasty.  Whitefish was excellent. Another very surprising and pleasant flavor profile. The lamb-chetta was inedible. I had two bits and pushed the plate away.  Whatever the attempt was with the dish was lost in a very sweet sauce. Big disappointment.   Much like a match.com first date.  Glad I went but no second date for me.  I think with a little more speed with dishes coming out of the kitchen and some minor tweaks like temperature on the chowder this would be a solid 4 star."}
