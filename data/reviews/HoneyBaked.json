{"text":"I came out to this Honeybaked Ham shop for the first time ever. Nice and early shortly before they got too busy. There was still a line, it was Tuesday before Thanksgiving. It is an odd set up, but maybe they just had it this way for the rush of the Holidays. It is a major assembly line, with most everyone looking quite unhappy to be there especially the girls checking you out.  The ham is good ,everyone liked it at Thanksgiving. We also had Turkey as well. The Ham kind of gives it a variety. I am not a fan of Pork , but this makes it truly edible. The food is good , just a bit of an unfriendly atmosphere. Parking can be tight on a busy shopping day.  It is in a good location though right on the corner of the shopping center where JC Penney's is located."}
{"text":"Catering or lunch, you're not going to be disappointed. The quality and freshness of food is fantastic, and the friendly staff has been very helpful. The party platter prices are moderate and the boxed lunches are an affordable crowd-pleaser. We used to get these at work as a goal reward and they were universally loved. This location is never busy, save for just before a holiday - but that's going to happen everywhere."}
{"text":"Amazed! Happy! And thankful! Ive been coming to this place for years, they are amazing! I bought a ham that went bad (my wrong doing) and i called to ask a few questions and april and cindy made my families christmas by switching out my bad ham for a new one! Thank you so much, im one loyal customer!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I stopped in to grab a ham for the week. Staff is always so helpful, professional and friendly. My wife decided she wants to eat lunch . So we ordered a turkey ham sandwich and they made it exactly as we requested. Delicious lunch and macaroni salad. Restaurant was very clean, tables spotless. Although it is expensive here, really great, quality ingredients. I recommend buying your ham and turkey here. Also stop by for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Good variety, efficient even with the holiday rush!  Food: Good, but a bit salty. I ordered a Ham and Turkey Pesto sandwich. The bread was fresh and the overall taste was good.  Cost: Ok, a bit over $8.50 for a sandwich and drink.  Service:  Efficient. This was the day before Thanksgiving, so the line was quite long outside the store. But the staff was friendly, and they had three registers open, so the line moved very quickly.  Atmosphere: Nothing to write home about. It's a \"cafe\" inside a retail shop in a shopping center.   Overall: Wouldn't want to come here often, but as a once-a-year treat when shopping for a Thanksgiving ham, it's fine."}
{"text":"Great experience, didn't think it would remind me of  back home on the east coast but as soon as I walked in I was greeted by the the girl at the counter. I tried the pesto special. It was amazing and so was the potato salad. Would love to recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"First time I've ever actually been the one to place an order and pick it up and I have to say that it was that easy!!. Picked up a quarter size ham as were not a large family for the holidays. The way they had the inside setup, it literally was \"pick up your ham and walk around the barriers like Fry's electronic where you can sample and pick up any other accessories ranging from rum cake, differently flavored mayonnaise, other desserts, cookie trays and more. If your that person responsible for bringing just the ham, this will definitely get you as all the items are set up to sample. Imagine going to Costco on a Saturday just for the samples, but you don't have to walk around the entire store and deal with the crazy parking lot.   Use the online ordering to reserve your ham. If you don't, I honestly don't think it's an issue as they definitely had plenty in stock on Christmas eve!   Nice that they have the instructions on how to reheat and how long you can keep it on the side of the bag. Freezing after a week I believe is key but I found so many different ways to use the little leftovers... In particular, a carbonara pasta dish where I diced up the ham... Everyone thought I used bacon as I got it nice and crisp.   The only issue I have is just moving through the amusement park style line to get around to pay. But overall looking forward to coming back for another holiday event."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is absolutely fantastic! Cindy went out of her way to make me fresh ham salad because I came all the way from Peoria. Everyone here is so friendly and helpful! The food is excellent and this location is by far the best honey baked location that I've been to! Cindy is fantastic and I can't say enough about how helpful she was!!!! Every time I come over to this side of town I will be coming to this honeybaked ham!!!"}
{"text":"Yuuuummmmmm!   I love Honeybaked Ham.  I love it on sandwiches too.  This \"cafe\" is a Honeybacked Ham store where you can walk up and order a sandwich.  They have a small menu with only a couple types of bread, but it's delicious!  I've never seen more than a couple people here at a time as long as I'm not visiting around the holidays."}
