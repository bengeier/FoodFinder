{"text":"We had our son's 1st birthday party last year during summer time. The hall was really nice and spacious. Since there was another party happening at the same time, they delayed our snacks and food. The waitress told the guests that mango juice is not unlimited therefore only one per guest. We were told that its unlimited. When we complained to the management then they apologized and let the drinks to be served unlimited later. All the guests complained about the washrooms."}
{"text":"Spacious venue for Indian Wedding Receptions, Engagement Parties and apparently Auctions. I've been here for 2 events - an Indian Wedding Reception and recently, an Auction.

Indian Wedding: 
- Swagat offers catering and bar services from what I know
- The ceiling's done up nice with frills
- Plenty of space for that bollywood dance routine
- Levelled stage for the bride and groom thrones 

Auction: 
- Stage for auctioneer
- Whole room can be used for items

Other ideas for events: art gallery events, charity events, etc."}
