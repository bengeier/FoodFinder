{"text":"My family just stopped in before closing and they were nice enough to let us in. The Santa Cruz pizza was especially delicious, as was the cheese ravioli."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and  Nice flavours for the pizza 's I order.But for the price you paid you don't get enough. It's  lacking ingredients, its basically a nice oven bread."}
{"text":"It's pretty good.  If Carlos the waiter is there it's even better. He's fun and a great guy. Food is just plain good. Nothing out of ordinary but consistent. The owner, John has the most beautiful wife and about delicious 5 kids!!   I believe Tuesday nights have great cheap specials."}
{"text":"California Pizza has reopened and is now owned by Carlos  and run with his wife and daughter.  The food is great. The service is fantastic. The atmosphere is amazing now that Carlos is back.  A two  star rating falls far short for the reborn resto. I recommend you try it  and then write a review of your own."}
{"text":"I like the pizza but not too crazy about the service. We went a couple of times during the evening when they were busy, and it seemed as though they couldn't handle it or they were short staffed."}
{"text":"Been eating here my whole life and my dad orders from here regularly. Lots of selection and not bad to eat there either. Notice the cool sign on Decarie."}
{"text":"It was my first time at California Pizza, and my last one. Very poor service. Food is over looked, salty. Can't even call this place a restaurant, more like a hash house. Plates were still wet. Glasses had water spots. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I tried out the pizza and calzone from here for the first time. The calzone was pretty good but the Santa Monica pizza didn't leave as good of an impression. When I came to pick up my order I was a bit surprised that the box was so small for a $15 pizza, but the real disappointment was when I opened my box to see what $15 really got me. It tasted very mediocre.   I also found it rather strange that they didn't have a cash register, but had to give me my change from a white envelope.   I won't be returning here unless they switch things up and convince me that the food here is worth my money.   The boxes in the photos are both 10x10 inch."}
{"text":"Oh heavens! We were 9 at the table and all 9 of us got out shaking our heads and being disappointed of our meals.  The menu looks appetizing and describes fresh ingredients and unusual combinations.  We have ordered a salad which was sold to be with avocados, artichoke hearts, oranges and grapefruit.  It came as a sad flimsy salad with a quarter of an avocado sliced ever so thinly and one slice of grapefruit without any oranges as well! No seasoning and it definitely did not taste fresh.  Moreover, my colleague ordered a vegetarian pizza that promised loads of veggies such as asparagus.  The pizza came without any asparagus.  As my colleague questioned the waitress, she just nonchalantly said they didn't have any in the kitchen and went away.  Then, my colleague asked for some avocado in substitution, they brought her one slice ! Sigh... The pasta were overcooked and under-seasoned.  Overall, this place left a bad taste in our mouth."}
