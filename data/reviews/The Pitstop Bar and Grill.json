{"text":"Really great small town restaurant and tavern!!! Food is really tasty. I'd eat here before any other place at this exit. Plenty of tv's to watch sports. Big football and NASCAR fans."}
{"text":"Holy crap what a find.   If you randomly find yourself off this exit,  skip McD's, snacks at the gas station,  subway - Go Here.  It's non descript,  save for a sign out front that says restaurant and games, and pizza and cold beer.   Sold.  It had been pouring so we walk in and there's an older gent mopping. He smiles and we walk by.  Place is empty.  No patrons,  no workers.   We seat ourselves,  and in a few minutes he finishes mopping and gives us menus and takes our drink orders.   I got one of the day's specials - hot ham and cheese and fries and J got an Italian beef sandwich with fries.  Ok now here's the real surprise...our mopping, waitering gentleman is amazing in the kitchen.  My sandwich was top notch - ham steak and white American perfectly done on marble bread.  J's was just as tasty- no steakums here.  This was real,  seasoned roast beef with a cup of beef drippings.  The fries on both plates were hot and crisp.  So lemme repeat that - we got a ham steak and tender, juicy roasted meat...... in a random bar/ arcade off an exit.     Two meals and drinks,  before tip,  just over $20."}
{"text":"I just found this place again. I was telling my dad last week about a place I stopped in Illinois around 6 years ago and can't remember where it was. I had a good experience and the food was great. This evening as I'm heading back home from a road trip I just decided to stretch my legs and here it is. Friendly staff, good food, good drinks. I'll remember where it is now if I ever come through here again since they've built a pilot across from it. They need a billboard."}
