{"text":"The new owners have definitely stepped this place up! As a health conscious customer, I typically get their salads and bun-less burgers. But lately I've been loving the Greek additions... so many great options in one spot, can't seem to get enough!"}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner for 3 of us, and while the restaurant wasn't busy, it was nice and clean and the food was really good. We will definitely be going back, their fish & chips meal was awesome 2 big pieces of light and fluffy battered fish and those old English style double fried fries."}
{"text":"Lots of options. Food was good. Nice to have a quality burger joint in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Had what was supposed to be a stone oven pizza.....it was neither.
12.25 for an 8\" white pasty disc of dough, with likely Ragu sauce, some fake bacon and barely melted cheese.
The pineapple was the best part.
This crap was even worse than a frozen pizza.
How many more places are going to try to sell \"Authentic\" \"Italian\" \"Stone baked\"  pizza and offer this.
Even Greasy Hut was better than this......and that is the worst pizza on the market.
Just remove your so called \"pizza\" from your menu, before you put yourselves out of business.
Only thing good was the service."}
{"text":"Ordered on Skip The Dishes and the food was still quite warm by the time we got it! We ordered a veggie burger and a regular beef burger and both were delicious! The amount of toppings is very generous as well! My only complaint would be the fries...we ordered garlic fries and it was literally fried with a little bit of garlic sprinkled on and most of the garlic was at the bottom of the container so I wouldn't order them again. However, would definitely recommend the burgers and will most likely order again!"}
