{"text":"let's just start by saying that just because i'm italian doesn't make me a coffee expert... BUT it helps!! i've drank so many espressos in my life at so many places that my palate is a bit critical!!

please never drink espresso where they write eXpresso (clue #1  !!!)

i stumbled on Pourquoi Pas while parking right in front of it, so after my lunch i decided to make a stop and try their coffee. i was pleasantly surprised just by the place itself, very small nothing fancy, great smell, a good ol' coffee shop

don't know the names of the 2 guys,  but they are just great and serviceable.

being served a shot of mineral water to rince your palate is a great way to impress me (not all good places in Italy even do this anymore!!)

the SHORT espresso was fantastic: nice nose of hazelnut? kinda biscotti type, nice ring of «schiuma» (little foam on top) and the taste was to my liking: a bit of acidity (wich some people might not like) and well balanced on the intensity.

can't talk about the other coffees they offer 'cause i'm an espresso man, but i can't imagine how they would go wrong, since they seem so professional with their approach.

the prices of coffees are really reasonable not overpriced at all

the only reason i did not give them 5 stars is because of their food prices, maybe it's just me and all the other places do it, but 1,50$ for a small cookie (as good has it might be) is way too much for me.

to all TH and Starbuck lovers, continue to drink ur diluated bad water/coffee!!

i know it's not possible, but we start by rincing our palate with mineral water, we could finish by rincing our cup with...  GRAPPA!!! 

Salute"}
{"text":"Still great to have the best coffee in the city.  Was amazing to see that the book 300 Reasons to Love Montreal rated this café and the best coffee in Montreal.  I love it.  Back in town for the weekend.  Going to see Queen and Adam Lambert at the Bell Centre in Montreal this coming Monday

The new colors look great at the café! People always as nice.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"La qualité du café est incroyable. 

Malheureusement, souvent le service est plutôt lent. Il faut donc y aller à des heures stratégiques et surtout ne pas s'y arrêter lorsqu'on est pressé."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and went. Fantastic. All they do is coffee and, I guess tea, so don't go for any other reason. But they are very serious about their coffee, very nice, and totally unpretentious. I tried two different espressos today- a Brazilian and a Tanzanian, and both were expertly made. Will go back tomorrow for further adventures. They also gave me (a first time visitor to Montreal with no French) a whole list of food recommendations around town. I went to the Marche St. Jacques as suggested and it is spot on for my taste as well. If these reviews speak to you, then this is your coffee place..."}
{"text":"Loved the friendly vibe here. Had a flat white which was the best coffee I had had since one I purchased at Toronto market. More like the flavousome coffee we get at home in NZ. Great to have a choice of brands  and milk. Would definitely frequent if I lived in this town."}
{"text":"The short version: best coffee in MTL.

The long: I recently moved here from San Francisco and I've been hunting for a place with coffee as good as philz or ritual or blue bottle. I've tried olimpico and cafe neve both of which are fine but pourquoi pas is the first place that really reminds me of home: great coffee, great staff, no attitude. Its got to be in the running for best coffee in the city.  I'll be back often."}
{"text":"I was in the area, so I just stumbled onto this new place. Based on the name, I figured, why not?

Once inside, it looked pretty nice and \"cool\" as a design. I had some tea and it was good. I feel like this would be a good place to hangout for younger people."}
{"text":"As a barista visiting Montreal from the Pacific NW, I had a hard time finding a good coffee shop. 
Pourquoi Pas offers multiple beans that are medium roast (a rarity here!) and takes the time to weigh each shot and prepare them with care. Absolutely left any other cafe we visited in the dust, we came here every day after our first visit :) 
The environment is great and the staff friendly. 
Definitely stop in."}
{"text":"I had a latte with their blend of almond milk and coco and it was amazing. Two hours later, I am still thinking about that coffee ans I am planning to go back! :-)"}
{"text":"Trying out thus place first time.  Ordered two latte one of each of their daily espresso roast.   Both I love.  Friendly staffs here made a perfect latte with their house milk (mixed of coconut milk and almond )  very pretty latte art.  Which made the latte looks and feels extra special.  ^_^  Will definitely come back to this little place of heaven when I am back."}
{"text":"The coffee is wonderful, and Tony really gets people together.  His cold brew is my local favorite"}
{"text":"What I like about Pourquoi Pas:

- Serious espresso drinks
- Delicious almond+coco milk
- Friendly owners and baristas
- Free wi-fi
- Te Aro (Pilot) fresh beans on sale. Must try the ViIla Donia! ;)

Enjoy!

{"text":"They don't come any coffee-snobbier than me, and I dug this place.  Took the barista's recommendation and had the latte with the house almond/coconut milk.  Magnefique."}
{"text":"Pour notre premier jour de visite à Montréal, mon chéri et moi, 2 lyonnais, avons pris notre café et thé du matin dans ce café situé dans le quartier du Village.
Première impression : la déco est soignée tout en restant simple. Drapeaux et tasses de couleur nous rappellent que le lieu est \"LGBT friendly\" ce qui est raccord avec l'esprit du quartier mais surprenant pour des Français fraîchement débarqués ^^ 
Un grand tableau noir décrit l'esprit du lieu : café de qualité et artistes locaux mis à l'honneur.
Nous nous y sommes rendus un dimanche matin et à l'ouverture nous n'étions que trois. Le serveur était très sympathique et le thé Perles du Dragon très goutu. Nous avons apprécié de savourer nos boissons près de la fenêtre en ce dimanche matin ensoleillé.
En conclusion, c'est un bon café de quartier pour bien démarrer la journée"}
{"text":"Très bon café et très bonne ambiance. Tristement les espressos sont un peu chers (3 CAD), mais entre ça et les espressos médiocres de la plupart des magasins de la ville, on fait vite le choix."}
{"text":"Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar is a great place in the village for anyone anyone that wants a great cup of coffee (They serve other stuff but their speciality is coffee). 

I came of couple of times before. This time I ordrered a Flat White, a hot cocoa and one of their homemade yogurt. 

The decor is standard for a coffee shop. Which means that you can either sit at a table, at the bar or closer to the big bay window giving a great view of Ahmerst. 

The service was laid back and professional. All of my questions were answered quickly and I was even asked some more. I was offered to either have my Flat White with home made almond milk, soy milk or with cow milk. All of the options were nice little options that made my experience even better.

The coffee was obviously the star of the afternoon! I had a Flat White which was totally different from the one you can get at Starbucks. First it wasn't drowned in hot milk. Second, it tasted like actual coffee. Third it was totally delicous. 

My cocoa was also very good. It wasn't overly sweet and the cocoa tasted a bit like cinnamon. 

The yogourt was served with dried fruits. It was as delicious as it was healthy.

Will I come back? For sure I will!"}
{"text":"Mocha was luke warm and super expensive, nearly $5. The lady who owned the shop was really nice though, salvaged a poorer coffee rating."}
{"text":"No wiifi and he was mean about it.  Americano tastes bad and the chairs are very uncormfrtable."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee oasis.  Highly trained, passionate, and pleasant baristas.  Great coffee options.  All around well done"}
{"text":"Located a bit further east than I usually venture, I had to come here after reading the reviews... And the place did not disappoint!

First of all, although I love plain ol' cow's milk, almond milk is my default for coffee, so I loved the house blend of coconut and almond milk. The coconut milk added an extra je ne sais quoi that worked perfectly with the nuttiness of the almond milk and the toasty notes of the espresso.

They have a variety of baked goods on offer. I chose the banana-chocolate square, which was on the dry side, but it was pleasantly banana-y and had just the right amount of chocolate.

The seating isn't the most plentiful and the arrangement isn't the most inviting, but it isn't terrible either. The window seats are perfect for people watching, but they're also up on a platform, so you do need to have some sense about you when going up and down - especially when you have one of their precious lattes in your hands!

Will return for sure."}
{"text":"As good as Piccolo's Espresso Bar, and slightly cheaper. My go to coffee shop if I'm staying in hostels around St Catherine's, or indeed when I'm willing to walk for it.

Choice of daily roasts (Ethiopian and Colombian when I was there). Serving staff were great, and price was right ($2.75). Had free wifi and you could sit at the window looking at the world, or at the bar chatting. 

A must go."}
{"text":"We ordered a mocha latte and a cappuccino both were perfectly prepared. The cappuccino seemed a little bit more like an espresso I know it's not supposed to have much milk in it but this had a very small of milk in it. Yet it was so smooth and not acidic at all that it was very enjoyable. The mocha latte was perfect as well. Would definitely order both drinks again. They have a few tables inside with a different one right at the front window you do need to be careful so you don't fall off and get hurt. We couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work but it looks like other people were if we were staying longer were.  Would have asked for assistance but we weren't staying that long.

 Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"There can never be enough caffeine in me these days and I am very grateful that Pourqois Pas is close to work. Yes, it's not the fastest place to grab an espresso, but all good things take time. Usually two types of beans to choose from, you can have the house blend of coconut and almond milk for any coffee bevies normally requiring dairy.

These guys know their stuff and are super friendly!"}
{"text":"This cafe is so homey. It's not the best place to show off on instagram but it gives such a homey vibe that I wanted to stay there all day. The barista was super knowledgable and helpful with what I should order. He was super talkative and it was nice to interact with such a friendly barista.They do change their blends all the time which is great if you love coffee as much as I do. There isn't that much seating so don't bring your whole study group here. They also sell Pilot beans in bags, thermoses and this really cool aero press coffee maker."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the growing third wave family in Montreal. Friendly knowledgeable staff serving up te aro on a little 2 group marzocco. Tasty shots, great milk and attention to detail. As others have said, more of a bar than a full cafe, so leave the laptop at home. Take a look on the chalk board where you'll find the day's selection of beans and don't hesitate to chat up your barista."}
{"text":"I felt like such a cool Montreal local when I stopped in this groovy little coffee shop one morning while on holiday ;) There was only one dude managing taking orders, making coffee, and taking payment. He was kind, spoke both French and English, and oh-so efficient! My latte was robust and full of body to give my day the boost it needed. Bonus points for getting to grab a healthy to-go juice for a snack later!

Inside there is a large table and a few other spaces fit for catching up with a friend of efficient working. Next time I'm back, I want to be able to order in French to feel like a true local at this gem!"}
{"text":"Petit café très mignon de la rue Amherst. L'endroit est plutôt petit, mais il y a tout de même plusieurs places (fenêtre, comptoir, grande table). C'est à la fois occupé et tranquille, ce qui fait du Pourquoi Pas un endroit super pour étudier un peu, travailler ou aller prendre un café avec un ami. Le personnel est super sympathique!

On y trouve des sandwichs, des pâtisseries et bien entendu, du café. Il est d'ailleurs délicieux! Le Pourquoi Pas offre aussi les jus Dose et autres produits de l'extérieur. Arrêtez-y si vous êtes dans le coin!"}
{"text":"Le café est excellent ! Même chose pour le chocolat chaud et le cappuccino.
Le service est très agréable.
Un endroit que je recommande sans aucune hésitation."}

{"text":"Delicious coffee and muffins and bright and open environment in a great part of town."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe! Loved my hot coco! It was fairly priced and tasted delicious!!! There are cute little pastries. And gluten free options!!! Cáfe had a clean restroom and free WiFi! The owner helped me and my friends find a place for dinner and was so kind! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Pourquoi pas? We ordered Americano and it tastes amazing. 
The atmosphere is very cozy and friendly. They have some magazines and books to read while you are in the coffeeshop. 
No muffins, no croissants, just amazing coffee."}
{"text":"The soy latte I got was good if a bit too foamy. The lemon-berry bar was delicious. The space is cramped but the window seats overlook the street. The location is just off the Main Street through the Gay Village. And yes they have soy milk!"}
{"text":"Le café est super bon! Le seul bémol c'est qu'il a vraiment pas beaucoup de place. Mais bon. J'ai adoré mon après midi là!"}
{"text":"Location: Just off Ste. Catherine Est, in the Village. Street parking available [metered] and the closest subway stops are Berri and Beaudry [green]. 

The place: Very small with a communal table and bar-type seating right in front of the window. Obviously I chose the window because I like to look at people look at me when they walk by. It's a super casual atmosphere and there's no pretentiousness of any kind. Also, I didn't see any hipsters. I did stop in on a Tuesday afternoon so the place was quiet. I'm not sure how it looks on the weekend. 

The goods: I ordered a Macchiato with the home made almond + coconut milk. The milk is awesome and totally worth it. These guys use Pilot coffee, which I sometimes like, while at other times, it leaves me indifferent. I had a custom blend that was roasted specifically for a café in Québec City that was awesome. The blend used for this Macchiato was OK but it was a little bitter for my tastes. I still enjoyed it though, and I'd say these guys are in my top 6 coffee spots. Yes, that's right, SIX, not five!

Service: The barista was so, so nice and friendly. 

Price point: $3.50 for the Macchiato, though I think there might be a surcharge for the home made milk. I forgot to ask. 

All in all, a very respectable coffee joint in this part of town. Check it!"}
{"text":"Face meltingly good coffee and espresso. I am not exaggerating at all when I say that this is the best coffee I have ever had. They have multiple grinds available every day and the barista can tell you the details of each without batting an eye or pausing to think. Words can't really express how good the drinks are here, but I'm about to try.

Espresso drinks are complex beasts. The espresso shot needs to be good, which means your grind must be good, which means your roast must be good, which means you actually have to care about your product and put a ton of effort into it. If you can pull a good shot, you still have to get the milk right. I know that seems like it should be the easy part, but it's a detail that you can't overlook. Most places, even dedicated independent coffee shops (not just Starbucks/Dunkin/Tim Hortons), get their milk too hot; when you overheat your milk it gets bitter and acidic and no longer serves as a foil to the bitterness/acidity of the espresso, but instead it amplifies all the bad flavors you don't want.  

When I placed the mug between my hands and they were warmed but not scalded I knew I was in for a treat. My expectations were exceeded in ways I couldn't have imagined in my wildest caffeine fueled dreams. After I scraped my face off the table I finished my mocha (not too sweet, not too milky, jusssssst right).  

On top of crafting amazing drinks, Tony the barista is super friendly. I felt welcomed the second I walked into the bar. On my first day in Montreal he gave me a sample of their freshly delivered baked goods (the onion tart was AWESOME). Then he recommended I try a few things and when I came back the next day he not only remembered my name but asked how my day had gone and had a few more suggestions. Nicest guy I met on my whole trip. 

The interior space is limited but I'd say it's more \"intimate and cozy\" than \"cramped.\" They don't have wi-fi but there are a few plug sockets if you're desperate. After you finish your drink, try their water. There won't be a bitter taste in your mouth that you need to rinse out and your mouth won't be burned but you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try their super delicious water before you leave. No, I'm not joking. The water pitcher is filled with lemon peel and fresh thyme sprigs which is the dopest water combination ever.

When I return to Montreal, this is my first stop."}
{"text":"Coming up on their 1 year anniversary, Tony & his small crew are cranking out top notch espesso drinks matching the best in the city (Myriade, Névé/Flocon, Café Plume, Pikolo).

Good bean, grind, machines, and baristas.  All you need for fantastic espresso.

Beans are from Te Aro (Toronto based kiwi Andy Wilkins), meaning Pourquoi Pas is skilled enough to earn the right to buy their roast.
- Te Aro has one 24kg roasting machine = capacity to support ~ 30 cafés
- Canadian roasted coffee is duty free to US
So, one can infer that Pourquoi Pas is judged by Te Aro as one of the top 30 cafes in the ON, QC, and possibly IL, NY, MA area (the reasonable shipping cost area)

Wow... too much caffeine = crazy tangents.

If you're gonna get wired, why not do it with the best?

p.s. their wifi is up and running"}
{"text":"Aeropress of the day is excellent coffee.  This is really high quality stuff.  If you require cream and sugar, skip Pourquoi Pas; the subtleties of good coffee will be lost.  

Nice little shop, friendly staff, decent prices. A few people have said the best coffee ever, and while I don't agree, it is quite good."}
{"text":"This place had such a nice ambience. And the coffee was amazing. The worker was really quick and even recommended a couple of items to us"}
{"text":"L'endroit est sympathique et vu sa petite taille et la disposition des tables (à proximité du bar)... l'ambiance est ce que vous en faites!

Nous avons pris un cappuccino ici, un soir de pluie, en attendant un événement à L'Olympia qui est à proximité. L'endroit ferme à 18:00 (le vendredi du moins) heureusement que c'était l'heure de notre événement.

Le cappucino est de bonne qualité et servi avec une touche artistique (un dessin original que vous voudrez immortalisé en photo)... seule ombre au tableau, il n'était pas assez chaud (ça aurait disqualifié l'endroit en Italie!).

Il y a une platine tourne-disque (oui, oui pour les vinyles, c'est comme ça que vous voyez que c'est un endroit \"branché\") et les clients peuvent emmener leurs disques. Quelqu'un avait oublier un \"Django Reinhardt\" et nous fûment bénéficiaire de l'ambiance ainsi créer. Avec la musique, la pluie et l'enthousiasme du serveur, on se serait presque cru dans un film de Woody Allen pour peu qu'on aie commencer à se poser des questions existentielles."}
{"text":"What a treat to find this fantastic espresso bar. I am visiting from SF and second everything said previously. The staff was friendly and gave me several food recommendations for my trip. The espresso was as good as my favorite haunts back home. The shots were pulled with care. This place is a must stop for any coffee lover's trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my coffee Americano, my sister was disappointed in hers.... she's not familiar with African blends ,consecquently, did not like the very light looking coffee or the taste. Very pleasant,attentive staff, very airy, sun-filled  space but limited seating.One can sit here and relax  and just enjoy one's coffee while watching the world go by on a quiet afternoon."}
{"text":"Petite place intéressante que j'ai trouvée grâce à Yelp en cherchant un café dans le coin.

Le \" Espresso Bar \" dans le nom décrit bien l'endroit : pas vraiment un café où l'on va se poser pour travailler ou jaser, mais plutôt un arrêt où trouver des produits de qualité avec des gens qui s'y connaissent. 

On a le choix entre deux types de grains pour notre café, ce que je trouve plutôt plaisant. Et pour le lait, on a pas moins de 3 choix : lait de vache (moyennant un supplément), lait de soya, et lait maison fait d'amandes et noix de coco. 

J'ai testé ce dernier, car j'étais vraiment curieuse. Le goût était pas pire, quoi que pas tellement mon genre car trop sucré à cause du coco. Le café que j'avais choisi avait également des notes de bonbons, selon ce qui était écrit. J'avais quasiment l'impression de boire du cupcake liquide par moment, mais je m'y suis habituée et j'en reprendrais je crois!"}
{"text":"I am quite particular about coffee and love some independant coffee shops.... and this is on my list of top 3 for Mtl with Myriade and Olympico.... Each has a different vibe... 

Pourquoi pas has super friendly staff... some decent space to sit... location is smack in the gay village... artwork on the wall is always interesting. The treats seem to look good - they seem to have gluten free or vegan options but I never tried any. Their speciality is their own mix of coconut and almond milk but I prefer cow milk in my cappucinos.... you need to ask for it though because the default is their own mix. 

Great opening hours during the holidays..."}
{"text":"Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui!
Un incontournable pour moi quand je me rends dans le Village.
Il faut monter Amherst à partir de Sainte-Catherine et être attentif au très chouette design de clous! Excellent café. Service parfois un peu lent, il faut préférablement s'y rendre quand on a un peu de temps. Autre hic: j'ai trouvé le thé assez cher comparativement au café. Peu de place pour s'asseoir, c'est vraiment fait pour un petit moment espresso... mais si vous trouvez une place pour y poser une fesse, un latte s'impose. Il y a du lait pour tous les goûts! Le staff est sympathique et attentionné. À voir et à boire encore et encore!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little coffee shop! It's small, cozy, welcoming and, above all, the coffee is delicious. And if you're a fan of almond milk, ask for their homemade cocoa almond milk. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I had a delightful latte here, and one thing that I noticed that was actually pretty awesome, was not having to pay extra for either soy or their house blend of coconut almond milk. Cow milk on the other hand was extra. 

When I got here, they had an array of sandwiches in the fridge (as well as salads) and offerings of vegan donuts. I didn't have a chance to try them but will give them a go next time Im in."}
{"text":"Im a decent barista, but these guys are amazing.  Totally progressive in their approach. Ill admit I was apprehensive at first.  Most impressive was the complexity of their single origin.  No need for a blend...I tried the el salvador (cap)and burundi (macchiatto) the default coconut or almond milk is a plus, but most baristas cant pull that off and make it taste right.  It tasted right. These guys are official."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and delicious coffee in the heart of the Village. Worth a return visit for sure!"}

L'espresso était excellent !
J'ai pu également y acheter une Keep Cup!
Le service était super sympa !

{"text":"Pourquoi Pas is hands down my favourite espresso bar in all of Montreal. They do everything right - from the source of their coffee beans to the way they make their coffee; the simple atmosphere of the store; and the welcoming personalities of every one of their owners and staff. To be honest, I would give them more than 5 stars if I could. 

It's no accident that their coffee is so well-made: the owners Tony and Tyler have a real passion for creating great coffee, and the quality of every cup of coffee matters to them in a personal level. 

They charge a pretty standard price for coffee. Each cup of coffee is topped off a nice little latte art as well (as shown in the photos)."}
{"text":"Pourquoi Pas is my favourite café east of Saint-Laurent and south of Mont-Royal, and among the very best in the city. All their beans are from Pilot in Toronto, the coffee organization behind the excellent Te Aro on Queen East and Crafted on Ossington. PP came through a recent change in ownership with completely consistent coffee. They have retained their (unusual for Montreal) rotating, two-option bean menu for espresso drinks, each posted with a few descriptors on a chalkboard. The staff are some of the sweetest and most welcoming folks you'll meet at a Montreal café, and they have a devoted local following in the Village. They've had a flat white featured prominently on the menu for years, and it is excellent, just like their lattes. Good wifi, and a rare, mostly (maybe all) vegan baked goods spread."}
{"text":"What an amazing cafe in Montreal. I'm so glad I found this place through a suggestion for best cafe spots in Montreal. The space and ambiance is beautiful and more importantly, their coffee is top notch. I can't believe they make their own coconut and almond milk! It's unbelievably tasty and its heated at the right consistency to get the nice foam on cappuccinos and lattes.

Mum got a cappuccino and I got a cortado. Both were excellent and I would definitely recommend it to a friend who's visiting Montreal. The cafe is located in the heart of the LGBT community there and its a quiet and respectable neighborhood. Very easy to get to by the metro system.

It's been a couple of months since my Montreal trip, but I still dream think about that cortado from time to time. Staff was very nice and just as you interact with them, you know they can make a mean coffee drink for you."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs cafés du quartier (village gai).

Café utilisé: Pilot coffe roasters qui est excellent. 

Pas beaucoup d'espace pour s'asseoir mais quand même quelques places. 

Endroit calme et décontracté, idéal pour lire. Musique \"new age\" hyper relaxante.

One of the best coffee shops of the gay village."}
{"text":"Small, simple cafe on the edge of the gay village that serves one of the tastiest lattes I've ever had. Free WiFi, a few tables, and some local art surrounding the central counter are just about the only accoutrements here, but it works well for the environment. Limited selection of baked good available. I had a savory scone (warmed up and tasty), but come here for the delicious coffee. 
  The friendly barista offered up a variety of beans for my latte and happily suggested the Brazilian when I asked for some guidance. Foamed to perfection with a full, creamy body and not a hint of bitterness, the latte arrived promptly and was the perfect way to start my day. My girlfriend had a chai latte with the house almond/coconut milk, which I also had the pleasure of sampling. It was much lighter than my traditional version, but the flavor was similarly excellent. Prices were very reasonable across the board.
  On our way out one of the men working behind the counter (maybe the owner) spotted to ask us how we liked everything, asked to us about our experiences in Montreal, and suggested a few other places to visit while we were in town! I'd come back any day just for the coffee, but the prompt and friendly service made it clear that they're interested in delivering not just a superior product, but also create a welcoming environment for their customers. I highly recommend you stop by and check it out if you're in the area and looking for a great cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Best espresso I've ever had. Stunning attention to detail in every aspect of the espresso process clearly evident in one great cup of coffee. A must visit."}
{"text":"Delicious ! Delightfull! A gentle whisper of study and read. The coffees are real and tasty."}
{"text":"Un excellent café!  Ambiance agréable, toujours 2 types de grains offerts...  Service ultra sympathique, probablement le meilleurs café des environs."}
{"text":"Not fully convinced. We had a mint tea and a filtered coffee which were good, but not out of this world, and a bit expensive. Bonus point for the raw sugar though. 

The place itself is very cool, a bit hipster (all light wood and white walls, robot paintings for sale on the walls). But it was soooo silent when we went. Admittedly, it was on a weekday afternoon, there was only a few people and most were on their computers, but a bit of music would have been nice - we felt a bit weird actually having a conversation out loud."}
{"text":"Petite ambiance 'homey' mais surtout un Flat White au lait d'amande et coco du tonnerre ! C'était très, très bon."}
{"text":"Come for your caffeine fix, but that's all she wrote.

Any place which serves you different beans based on you having either a black it white (milk) coffee is doing a good thing.

The place itself is nice and obviously new, but I wasn't such a fan of the seating arrangements - it's very much a coffee bar, not a cafe, so don't come planning to spend a long time here.

I was going to give this place 3 stars because they also have no food available (none at all!), but in the end I decided the coffee was good enough to warrant 4 stars. I ordered a flat white and it came out more like a piccolo latte, but maybe that's just an Australian opinion.

This is the kind of place I wish I lived next to, so I could hit it up on the way work everyday."}

{"text":"Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar serves hands down one of the best lattes I've had in Montreal so far! Located in the Village, it is easily accessible to downtown dwellers, workers, tourists and passersby. The only downside I find is that it closes so early (6PM everyday).

Small and simple, the venue is decorated with cutesy works of art for sale. The barrista was very nice and produced a killer frozen latte. What more could I possibly ask for?"}
{"text":"I went through the trouble of re-activating my YELP account just to post a review and give this café a well deserved 5 stars. Their \"house milk\" as other have mentioned really drives their product home. If you're in the area and you're looking for a excellent coffee based drink, or even a small snack (muffin, cookie, brownie) do not skip on the occasion to pay them a visit. The staff is friendly, not to discount others but Tony and Emma are extremely friendly and will make you feel like family! Another thing I found surprising is the amount of work that is put into making the right coffee; they weigh out the grounds and then weigh the coffee once its poured so you know it's consistently great. 10/10 will drink their coffee again!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe! Visited just this morning. Sat down with my partner to plan our day. I got a chai latte with the almond/coconut milk and it was delicious. Staff was really friendly and offered suggestions of fun things to do in the area. We wish we had a cafe like this near us."}
{"text":"Definitely the best latte I've had in Montreal. The baristas have been very friendly each time I've visited and given suggestions on bean selection. The café itself is a little bare, but has some nice window-seating and is clean and inviting. Coffee is pretty much the only option, but it's good enough that that's ok."}

Pourquoi pas... même pas la peine de se poser la question..."}
{"text":"The coffee is excellent. The staff are friendly, helpful and eager to discuss their coffee and give brewing advice. They carry and brew Te Aro coffee from Toronto.  One can typically choose between three kinds of coffees for cups consumed on the premises but they sell a larger selection of beans as well. Another point of interest is they serve flat whites.  The focus is on the coffee, there is limited seating and wifi is not available."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS CAFÉ! I saw that they were doing personalized latte art (basically they would make a tulip and write whatever word you want inside), so I got my \"Cindy\" latte from them and it was amazing! The café is really cute and has great ambiance, the interior decor is lovely and there are plants everywhere. I would come back to study and talk with friends!"}
{"text":"For someone who drinks as much coffee as I do in as many cafés as possible, it's rare for a café to truly surprise me. Pourquoi Pas did, and in a very good way.

It started with ordering a latte. I was met with a simple question: what kind of milk? The options that followed were not the \"skim, 2%, whole\" that I'd expected, though, but rather, \"house-made almond/coconut, soy, or cow's milk\". Hearing \"lait de vache\" come across, with a slight prickliness to it, caught me off guard. (Of course I know milk comes from cows, but never when ordering a drink does that fact come to my attention.) I stumbled. I fumbled. \"Regular, you know, um, milk.\" Herp de derp, smooth move, Katie. 

After tripping over my obviously non-vegan beverage order (callous carnivore as I am), I looked at the menu more closely and noticed that cow's milk carries an extra surcharge, and is indicated by a weepy broken heart on the chalkboard. I was tickled by their apparent display of ethics (and judgment?), and determined to try their lait maison the next time, so I could be a cool and compassionate coffee snob, too. I also noticed that their standard coffee was an Aeropress, which gets props from me (I love my home Aeropress), and also noticed the striking lack of other options on the menu. This is, uncontestedly, an espresso bar. A one-trick pony, perhaps, but that one trick is a showstopper.

The latte set before me -- made with creamy dairy goodness stolen from the mouths of bleating calves at their mothers' teats -- was phenomenal. Perfectly balanced, not bitter in the least, and made with a perfect microfoam swirled into lovely latte art. Mmmmm. 

The next time at Pourquoi Pas, not even a week later, I tried their house almond and coconut milk, and was impressed. It made great foam, and had a rich but sweet nutty flavor. But, for all that, even with the added bonus of self-righteousness for not exploiting our bovine friends, I regretted not getting cowmilk. Sweet, delicious, calorific, uncompassionate cow's milk. I'll placate my conscious by imagining that the extra charge goes toward buying the most wonderful, single-origin, free-range, fair-trade, grass-fed, eco-conscious milk from the happiest cows in Quebec. Or one can hope."}
{"text":"Fast service, their espressos were tasty and the barista was extremely friendly. 
He was nice enough on a busy day to recommend us more third wave coffee shops and we gave it a go and he was absolutely right about things he said!"}
{"text":"La grande snob à café en moi a trouvé un autre petit recoin de paradis en allant au Pourquoi Pas. Leur spécialité c'est définitivement l'espresso. Pas de pâtisseries, de salades ou de sandwich pour vous distraire. Simplement que du bon café. Ils offrent le fameux \"Flat White\" que je prends souvent dans les cafés en Australie, mais je ne l'ai pas trouvé si différent d'un latte. J'ai vraiment bien aimé mon café et j'y retournerai pour goûter aux autres car ils changent leurs sélections de grains de temps en temps pour le café filtre si j'ai bien compris. La seule chose qui manque pour la fameuse 5e étoile, c'est l'ambiance de la place. C'est bien tranquille mais la disposition des chaises et tables ne rend pas l'endroit très chaleureux. Ça donne vraiment l'impression qu'on y va pour y acheter notre café, mais pas nécessairement pour y rester quelques heures et y lire un livre tranquillement ou bien pour jaser entre amis."}
{"text":"I love this place, from the gender neutral bathroom, how bilingual it is, the decor to the amazing coffee. Their flat white made with the house almond coconut milk is out of this world amazing. Every time I come to Montreal I have to visit this place. I wish I could bring it home with me. I also adore that they have vegan friendly desserts, which is awesome for me. Cannot recommend it enough."}
{"text":"I had an excellent latte and scone here.

When I ordered the scone, the gentleman behind the counter asked, \"Do you want me to 'eat it up for you?\"

Not sure why he wanted to eat the scone I just purchased..."}
{"text":"Le café est excellent, il change régulièrement donc on goûte à plein de saveur! Ici le lait végétal est roi, il y a plus d'une sorte, dont le lait maison fait à base de lait de coco. Il surprend la première fois, puis fini par tomber sur le coeur éventuellement. C'est très goûteux et riche. Au final, on vient ici pour le café, un espresso sans sucre c'est parfait! On compte près de 5$ pour un café, seul bémol."}
