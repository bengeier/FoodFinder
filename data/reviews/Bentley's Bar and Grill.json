{"text":"My Boyfriend and I went into eat three times and no cook. This is a 24 hour town and people like to eat drink and gamble after work. So I am giving it one star. Plus no Premium Liquor..."}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for about 20 people and couldn't have been more pleased with the service.  Wait staff was extremely friendly and responsive.  The pizza and wings were also great, as good as any I've had in town.  We weren't there to watch a game, but looks like the perfect place to do so."}
{"text":"Elaina the bartender is nothing but class....she was upbeat, welcoming, and friendly...thank you for making me feel at home ! 5+ stars to you :)"}
{"text":"My other 1/2 and I come here for late lunch/early dinner about once a month! (And have been since 2009.) We have yet to have a bad or disappointing meal! Debbie, JoJo & Phil always greet us like long lost pals and treat us like family. Going there this Thursday and am already trying to decide what to order-beside the happy hour beer"}
{"text":"Went to watch a Husker game. Real Husker's from Nebraska are not rude like this. We didn't even get three chance to eat or drink. Left after being shoved and T told to move."}
{"text":"I was in there last october. I wanted to give myself a cooling off period before I wrote this because I use to go in there and eat all the time. I started sitting at the bar. Because I noticed they had a very attractive female bartender bartending. So I started going in there on my fridays. The first week I was there she didnt charge me that much. But I didnt have that much to drink. The second week I was there I drank a little more but I was playing. The next week I went in I didnt play at all. And I drank a little more. Well by the time I got ready to leave my bill was rediculus. At first I thought the bartender over charged me. I didnt want to pay the bill. But then she got upset and told me you ordered them your paying. I always pay. just didnt think it was right. So I went home and soberd up. And looked at my bill the next day. I decided after looking at it. It wasnt her fault. This place just really over charges for drinks. I will never drink there again."}
{"text":"Out of some menu items but everything we got was delicious!! Adult atmosphere so I wouldn't recommend it for kids."}
{"text":"Do not eat the chicken fingers there... They are fake meat and frozen. Got some to go and bit into a frozen piece of chicken!"}
{"text":"What kind of a bar does NOT play the most important games going on? We are now watching the cubs vs nationals game playoffs with no sound because the \"owner\" refuses to put the sound on. Might I add that EVERY single person in this bar is here to watch the game.. I even asked the bartender, what if I'm a big gambler can I listen to what I want to listen to (which is how it is at every bar I've ever bartended at) and he said .. no, owner wants only music no sports. Then don't be a sports bar !!! So ridiculous, not coming back."}
{"text":"The new owner has had this place for at least a year. They have yet to change the old Nicki Lee's sign which is out front. The menus are ripped up and falling apart, showing the new owner doesn't care about appearances. We come here because the pizza is delicious and their wings are great too. I hope their kitchen is clean, looking around here I think this place would be perfect for that Bar Renovation show on T.V.!"}
{"text":"Standard sports bar with surprisingly good food. 
The sliders on the happy hour is a deal.. 
the mushroom Swiss burger is delicious!!"}
{"text":"We found this great place to have wings!!! Their wings are really good. When we first starting coming here it was called Nikki Lees and we got more wings for our money. Now the special we used to get large pizza and wings only comes with 10 wings and that was disappointing because the price stayed the same. But the wings are really good. The staff is super nice we love Elena. If it wasn't for the less serving of wings at same prove I would have given them a 5 day review."}
{"text":"College football themed dive bar check-list...

- Lots of TVs 
- Smokey smell in the air
- Chicken fingers with a smattering of sauces
- Menus made of paper and stapled together
- Sassy waitresses
- Dark and depressing
- The, \"Why am I here vibe\"
- Random silverware on the floor
- Nebraska memorabilia EVERYWHERE
- Old salty customers

... And pretty much all the bad stuff that they never show you in \"Cheers\", but the food is ok."}
{"text":"Great place to get back have a beer. They are offering country music dance classes on Friday and Saturday nights. Right place to go to hang out have fun get some inexpensive drinks gamble a little bit and meet other people."}
{"text":"Huge wait at Egg Works so we went over to Bentleys for breakfast...however the place smelled so bad of cigarettes we couldn't stomach to eat in there.  A few people were smoking at the bar and I approached a man working there. I asked him about the smoking policy. He was snied and rude. I asked who the owner was and he said he was the owner. I was really surprised that you could smoke inside the restaurant... I thought that it was against the law!
We will never go there again and I will be contacting the clean air coalition."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for well over a decade (previously Nikki Lee's) and used to love it until last Friday....walked in and a majority of the tables were gone and it had turned in to Cowboy Country night...WTF. Love the food and service, but will not be stopping by anytime soon. Know your niche Bentley's and get rid of this country dance hall BS."}
{"text":"One of our favorite bartenders is working here!  They have grown folks nachos!  When I ordered the nacho's he said OHHHH NOOOOO, because he knows how I am about the nachos!  But guess what!  They passed my test, I only ordered 1/2 an order, and it was so much.  I did the steak nacho's 1 time, and the chicken nacho's another time I went!  I like the steak nacho's better.  The jalapeno's they keep the seeds in them, so they have some kick to it. My hausband had the pizza one time, and the philly cheese steak.   He liked them both.  We also met the owners, there really nice.  They don't have our favorite beer on tap yet!"}
{"text":"Just want a review about the service tonight, from the so called \"bartender\".  After my 3 friends and I ate in the dining room.  Each had meals.  Both my girlfriend and I ordered 2 cocktails with our meals, we sat at the bar and played machines which we have done for the past 4 weeks. After putting in over $20 in a poker machine this a-hole asked me if I already closed out my tab out our table, which cost me over $40, in order to order another glass of Chardonnay which would cost you about $1.50.  When I questioned whether that would not matter since I was now playing a poker machine and entitled to free drinks, this moron asked if I was playing $20...  I have lived here for over 30 years.  I have never dealt with someone as ignorant as this.  Not only did we close out our tab.  We paid for our meals at a table.  Paid and tipped that server, and you, you dumb bi..ch have the nerve to tell me to calm down?"}
{"text":"Wow! Where to start...how about the fact that I put $40 in a machine and I was still charged $7 for my drink.  Any other place would comp you a drink if you put $20 in.

But what about the food? I opted for the lemon chicken, a delicious yet simple dish...there was no trace of lemon anywhere in the dish.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, I'll give it that, but that's about it. The noodles were bland.  The sauce was overly greasy which carried over onto the spinach. The dish was a huge disappointment.  This was my second time here and definitely my last."}
{"text":"Great food for a bar. Pizzas are HUGE.  My burger wasn't greasy and the salad was very fresh."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It is always constant good food, friendly staff and it is a very nice place to bring friends and just hang out for a while. It is very open with high ceilings so the ambient noise level is low."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time.I just say that the bartender Edward is literally the nicest most pleasant bartender I have ever met. He makes you feel welcome and happy to be at his bar"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't really look twice at a random sports bar, but there aren't a ton of places in LV (especially in my neighborhood) where you can bring kids and watch football. Bentley's gets points there because it's not super smoky, they serve food, and it's never packed, so there's plenty of space for the kids to move around if they want.
It's a pretty good place to watch football because there are lots of tvs and you can get a speaker for your table if you ask.
Bonus for the patio outside, looking at Sunset Park.
However, they lose points several other places: the management (after 2-ish years) has yet to change the outside sign from Nikki Lee's to Bentley's. It's dark and dirty-feeling inside. 
Food is a little high priced.
They can't even bother to print out a nice-looking menu at FedEx and have it laminated. Instead they give you a photocopied version of the old one, stapled together (seriously).
So overall, Bentley's is kinda divey (which is not my scene), but due to it's family-ish atmosphere, we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"So I got off work wanted to try something new and thought I'd stop in for a quick one. The bartender Jay was great but the selection of beers not so much. I first ordered a Heineken and not in stock. Next I asked for a Coors light...not in stock. I felt bad for this guy cuz almost everything I wanted they didn't have and I could see in the bartenders face he wanted to give good service but he couldn't provide a product. I don't know what the story is here but I know this place was previously called Nikki's and I remember seeing the parking lot full. Anyway the service is great but the selection not so much and it's too bad cuz it's a nice place inside and the food is decent at a fair price. I'll come back from time to time and see if any action has been taken on the alcohol selection and give an update."}
{"text":"Really smokey, i'm surprised any restaurant/bar would allow smoking any more?  We tried the nachos and the wings.  WIngs were OK but the nachos were terrible and cold.  Overall pretty disappointing place.  Lots of friendly Husker fans though (+1 star)."}
{"text":"If this review were based solely on the food and the service, it would get 5 stars. I remember 10 years ago, before kids, when this was the go-to spot for me and my husband in the early morning after clubbin all night. Now, with two kids in tow, it's still the best NY style pizza and wings I've had to date. Lately, we go in after my husband's softball games and Elaina has been a super star! She's always super friendly and attentive and my girls love her! 

The downside and reason for 4 stars is that the restaurant always seems to be in disarray. Last time, the ladies restroom reeked and was just not clean, this time...a toilet seat was completely missing..."}
{"text":"Attentive but not disruptive service, good food at good prices.
Nice place for a lunch meeting. Good location (road construction messes it up now), easy parking."}
{"text":"Come one come all Cornhusker fans!!! This is the place!!!Bar food is bar food- but this place ranks higher. The nachos were fresh, pretzel bites DELISH!"}
{"text":"This place is great I love the all star Pizza we added black olives for my son. The staff was wonderful great customer service. There is Plenty of room in the Bar area to watch sports on the several large screens. We had the side Caesar salad big for 3 ppl it was very good the croutons were homemade and I could taste the seasoning and garlic delish. I think this will be our after church spot...."}
{"text":"What the heck happened Bentley's?!? You USED TO BE SO FUN!
The service is totally wack; like if you want food at the bar you MUST order from a server on the floor and if you want drinks on the floor, not food, it is practically impossible and they hate when you ask for either/or.
Two people working the bar where 100+ people are crowded around BECAUSE they 're-did' the open floor into a dance floor; which now means no more Flip-Cup or Beer Pong inside and it has been so darn cold outside so nothing going on out there of course. Obviously the whole vibe is off and we waited for 20+ mins to order drinks before finally deciding to just go to my own house where the drinks are wayyy cheaper, we can listen to WAY BETTER music (seriously playing YMCA on a computer and sitting on your phone?!- I hope you are not paying her much), play beer-pong, and not wait forever to get crappy service- truly the bartenders and servers seem so unhappy when it gets busy, like don't you want to make money? 
This is coming from a kick-baller who used to go after games with the teams and have a blast but things have changed at Bentley's and not for the better. If I were WAKA, I wouldn't be too happy since they advertise the crap out of Bentley's to everyone and I am sure WAKA's people bring in a ton of their weekly earnings; now it's not really fun any more. 
I am so confused about the dance floor, they put all this money into it but for what? Seems like people aren't really going to Bentley's anymore because of the changes. 
I guess I should give this place a chance on a weekend some time and see if people actually dance..doesn't make sense to me but whatevs. 
Good luck Bentley's."}
{"text":"This is just a review of Bentley's during a Nebraska football game. Granted, I'm sure this large sports bar has something to offer for pretty much any sports fan because they have TVs, both large and very large ALL over the place. The food is pretty much your standard bar food (wings, pizza, burgers etc). But come Saturday when college football is in full swing, this place literally becomes a microcosm of Lincoln, Nebraska. Tables are assembled end to end to maximize capacity and don't forget to wear your Big Red shirts! Or if you want, you can buy from the merch table which has a wide selection of \"Las Vegas Nebraskan\" shirts and hats. There was cheering. There was yelling. There was chanting, singing...heck, there was even a cardboard Bo Pelini kitty! I'd estimate that there were between 200-300 Husker fans here. Whether you're a Las Vegan or a tourist, all you really have to be is a fan of Big Red! I highly recommend trying this out."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and so glad we can here for Valentine's Day...always warmly welcomed and very friendly service. You just feel the love here, like motherly welcoming love.  Outstanding service that stays consistent... drinks are great, food is great! We love this place!!"}
{"text":"I was told to come here to get pizza. I think next time I will pass. The ladies working were very nice, and responded as soon as I entered. However ordering a large pepperoni pizza that has 18 pepperoni on it, for $20 seems like kind of high priced to me. Overall I've had better pizza elsewhere, that either has toppings actually on it, or taste better."}
{"text":"oops...recently returned and so....charged for the ranch dressing without being told and to top it off...the ranch was watered down....not joking...watered down...who F ing waters down ranch dressing and then charges you for it...in my mind symptomatic of other hidden issues...I wont be back"}
{"text":"Bentleys is a great neighborhood bar, they have a very wide variety of menu on the menu they have everything from pastrami sandwiches to multiple salads and everything in between.  So far have eaten several items on the menu and every item is well cooked, taste great,  well-balanced and I have enjoyed  them!  Most important the food servers and the bartenders are outstanding!

I really enjoy this neighborhood bar, it's  close to where we live, the food is good, the people are friendly and nice it's a good time. I recommend it to anybody who lives over in the sunset & eastern area."}
{"text":"I stopped in after work near by ordered a shot of Jose Cuervo at the bar the guy charged me $7.00. What a rip off. I will never go back"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!!! Classic New York style so cheesy and amazing sauce!!! This is where you wanna go for pizza folks!! Used to be called Nikki lees but same food same service!! We always get a pitcher of beer and an 18 inch!!! Yummm"}
{"text":"The waitress was really sweet. I had spaghetti and meatballs with literally only 1/4 cup of noodles. For $13.95?! Really? I could have bought a can of chef Boyardee with more noodles than what was on my plate. After having dinner in the dining section, we jumped on the machines on the bar. Asked the bartender for some ashtrays, I got an ashtray. But the other person in our party got a plastic soufflé cup with water in it. Really?! When we first got to our machines the bartender asked if we wanted anything to drink, none of us needed a drink. But he never came back to check if we needed anything. After dropping $200 in their machines (and the other person in my party dropping $500), we needed some drinks, which we were only going to get some water and soda. But the bartender never came back to our side of the bar, except to scream at a couple leaving \"you owe a dollar for your drink\" which turns out, after a yelling match, that they didn't because they gambled on the poker machines. It's sad to see how bad this place has become. I used to come here when it was Niki Lee's and service was never an issue. I don't usually like to write reviews, especially bad ones. But tonight's experience is worth writing about. Will I recommend this place? No. Hell no. Will I return? No. Hell no!"}
{"text":"Bentley's is located across the street from Sunset Park near Eastern on Sunset Blvd. It used to be Nikki Lee's. I guess its been Bentley's for 4 years, but they just changed the sign out front, so that's when I noticed. Interesting to have a 4 year delay in signage.

I came in looking for football, and that's what I got. They have 5 or 6 very large screens over the bar so you can watch multiple games. The gaming bar occupies basically a corner of the space, with tables and booths, and also a larger area set up for banquets. 

The food is typical bar foods, with an Italian theme. I ordered the \"Mama's Lasagna\" and it was pretty good, served with numerous garlic knots. You can get wings, pizza, and more. 

Overall, for watching football, this place works. It wasn't very crowded on a Sunday afternoon so plenty of seating. The food is good, the service is friendly, the drinks are strong. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer for many years. Celebrating parties, family dinners and so on.  Last night you lost a family.  We sat at the bar, played and had a few drinks.  Asked for our dinner bill and to our shock we were charged for our drinks.  We were told 1 free drink for every $20.00 played.  I played $60.00 plus the $20.00 I won.  My husband played $60.00 plus the  $40.00 he won.  I had 2 drinks had he has 5 beers.  The bartender said she would check with the general manager.  Came back said sorry but we had to pay for 3 of the drinks.  I told her we have been coming there for years.  Her reply she never seen us.  I told her to check with the waitress.  Besides that, don't you think that should have been stated right up front, your policy.  She stated I could go talk to the GM.  He was there, he should have come right over once he knew there was a dissatisfied customer. Sadly you let a truly loyal customer walk out the door unhappy.  I love this place.  The food,  waitresses and my family grew with NL'S then Bentlys.  This has never been a policy that any bartender has ever mentioned to us.  Thanks for all the years of great service, but your GM should have reacted and made every attempt to keep an extremely loyal customer."}
{"text":"Wow I was very disappointed. We came in and the place wasn't crazy busy. Sat down a waitress brought us our beers, ordered food nothing special wings and a club.....we wait.....we wait....we wait.....1 hour 20 minutes later we still don't have food. A different waitress asks the cook for our order and still no food..... so we left some money on the table and walked out. Sad thing was booths that were empty when we walked in had customers sitting with there finished plates."}
