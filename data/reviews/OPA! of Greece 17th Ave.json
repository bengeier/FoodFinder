{"text":"I love Opa, but was a little disappointed with this location. While the service was excellent, the food wasn't up to the standard I've come to expect from Opa."}
{"text":"Was a usual spot for us but no longer. New owners seem to not care. The place is looking run down. Had to go back cuz they gave us such small portions for our side salad. Then argued that their sign says 8 ounces or something. Previous owners were generous with any modifications and it just seemed cleaner. Too bad Opa is usually an ok spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Had a veggie pita. Usually it's just greek salad in them, but had some weird ingredients when they made it."}
{"text":"NASTY!! I won't set foot in here again EVER!!   I came in this afternoon a little after 4pm, and there was 3 people in the store, all had gotten their orders. I waited at the counter for about 5 minutes and hadn't even been acknowledged, which is a bit bothersome. When the clerk finally appeared (out of the prep area) she seemed angry to have to do her job. I ordered my greek salad, lamb kabob and pita bread, and never got asked if I wanted cheese or olives, and when I asked her to add them, she rolled her eyes like it was such a hard ship. When I got home to eat, I found a spider in my greek salad, and when I called to mention it, was told \"not our issue\".  Sorry, Opa. Never again!"}
{"text":"Seriously bad eating experience. Skimped on Greek salad, the restaurant was dirty, the guy serving talked on the phone the entire time and only did hand gestures to me (sorry to interrupt your call dude!) and the bathroom sink was clogged and looked full of vomit. Skip it and go anywhere else. You can't get much worse."}
{"text":"I'm an Opa! junkie. I eat it five, or more, times a week. Around 50% of my Opa! meals come from this location.  This location is close to my office, and offers classic Opa! fare. I'm a big fan of their wraps, which are made in the most amazing, warm, and \"fluffy\" pita bread.  It is a very small location, and I've never seen more than two staff members on at once. The staff are incredibly friendly and are always a pleasure to interact with.  This location loses a star for being a bit on the \"dingy\" side. It isn't actually dirty, it may just need freshened up a bit. A fresh coat of paint, maybe? But, if you're a fan of Greek food and are looking for a quick bite in the area, this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"I love OPA and the food however this location is lacking big time. The same guy is always working when I go in and he is always rude to me and he really does not make the food to good standard. Gives you less of everything and usually rolls his eyes if you ask for more.  I once ordered an Opa Platter for my husband and asked to substitute the Greek salad for cesar as my husband doesn't like Greek. He started making the Greek salad and when corrected him he got all mad and blamed me for not speaking clearly... I am quite sure I spoke very clear as I know my husband does NOT like Greek salad. It's pretty bad that I avoid going because I don't want to go there when this man is working as he's always arrogant.    I noticed this weekend it is closed, I am hoping that when in reopens there will be new employees and new management."}
{"text":"\"Oops I did it again\"... Britney Spears   Whenever I have food craving I always want Calamari for some odd reason and I know I can always count on Opa.  So when I saw it while shopping there ain't no way Imma passing it by.  I love Opa in that unlike other fast food joints I know my food is always fresh, when I heard the fryer starting up for my Calamari, my mouth was already salivating.  This location is nice and spacious and basically just has the bar seating but it's nice, clean and comfortable and the staff is really gracious  My huge plate of Cali came with tons of fresh tsatsiki sauce, fresh lemon and sliced red onion, it was fresh, lightly battered, crispy and incredibly delicious at under $6.    Amazing!"}
{"text":"Opa! I always want to smash a plate when I say this word, except I've never gotten to. And I still don't get to at Opa, but that hasn't spoiled the experience yet.  I love that 17th has an Opa. It keeps me out of a food court when I'm craving the lamb souvlaki (you'll learn soon enough that lamb is my absolute favourite meat) and Greek salad. My pita and meat are grilled on the spot and served with plenty of tzatziki. I'm a fan of the big chunks of tomato and peppers in my Greek salad, although I do my best to pop a breathmint or piece of gum afterwards (onions).  It's clean and well run, and I always get a smile, even if it's just a little one when one of the more quiet staff members is manning all stations.   Four yums up for Opa on 17th :)."}
