{"text":"Love the decor, service and the ribs are probably the best in Montreal."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a steak this is not the place to go. We go here on a regular basis as my friends like the patio.  Always disappointed with the food minus one time and we have spent most of our summer here.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Kinda overpriced, but it is Montreal. Service was abysmal. This place is not as fancy as they think they are. Much better options for a bar and grill I the immediate vicinity. Can't recommend."}
{"text":"Is it fair to pile on a 'restaurant' with one star?  In an airport?  A place where no one will eat unless forced to?  As I listen to the low grumble of building nausea; I vote yes. Even if it means I save only one. 

With a Birdseye view of The Tarmac here in Montreal, my hopes were high. Smooth sailing through customs had left me with plenty of time to enjoy breakfast.  I sat at the counter directly facing gate 78. Enjoying the bustle of passengers running for their gates. 

There is a strong French influence here in Montreal. I went to Paris once. They love food. A lot. Was it too much to hope for a croque monsieur...at a place in Canada named Houston? Get real. 

I had the breakfast sandwich. I knew I was in trouble upon its arrival. A spoonful of mayonnaise in a plastic container was nestled next to a dozen or so recently frozen potatoes. The breakfast sandwich consisted of: Bread(dry), placed against a soggy slice of iceberg lettuce, alongside two small mushy tomatoes, 2 fried eggs, Oscar meyer grade ham and a slice of american cheese. Maybe I'm overly eager to see Sausage Party this weekend, but I swear that piece of cheese looked me in the eye and said, would it have killed them to melt me?

As I chewed through this aberration, I couldn't believe it. Did I just hit the next level? A hair? No. Please. I considered continuing to chew and save myself from the visual confirmation. I had to know. I pulled out the strand and it was white. A dried piece of fried egg?  No such luck. A stretchy thin piece of white plastic. I was done. And so should you. 

With any luck, there will be a new contender the next time you come here."}
{"text":"I would say 3.8. My steak was good but my wife's prime rib was not good. Service was good."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend last week

The decor is awful and the music is so loud you have to shout at eachother. Also, why do they only have red lighting? it felt odd

I really enjoyed the food. We got Sliders, Goat Cheese Dip and 2 filet mignons which were awesome.

the service is slow and it was hard to get our waitresses attention alot of the time"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced and 90% of it was horrible. Considering they promote there ribs and steak it should be amazing right? NOPE. The ribs were grainy, bad quality and had an after taste to them. The steak was burnt like all the reviews mentioned, French onion soup was so salty it was not edible. The calamari was soggy and rubbery. The burger was ok but it was 20 dollars and they gave us maybe 10 fries. This is a \"Bay Street\" eatery and is great for drinks but that's it."}
{"text":"Came here for a social dinner with some friends. The service was mediocore but the food we ordered was horrible. It was all cold when it came on the table. The steak was burnt outside and I could taste the bitterness in my mouth, not to mention it was very dry. The lobster that was part of the meal was so dry it was was glued to the shell.  The worst part is all the garnish was burnt...how can something that basic be burnt. Maybe consider scurbbing the grill"}
{"text":"great atmosphere!  great food!  sit on the patio on a nice warm summer night!
Love it"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks but terrible service! Came here for a round of drinks and apps after work and the mess started when two people from our group wanted to clear their tab and leave early. The server took over 20 minutes to come to the table so we decided to pay at the front. SHE THREW A MASSIVE FIT! She clearly wanted a tip at any cost and when we explained that the two were running late she didn't care to apologize. Later when we order nachos for the table with no chili she stormed away while we were talking to her saying that the two who left early didn't tip her enough (with good reason). The manager also showed little concern for our complaint. He instead called her their best server.....I wonder who their worst is."}
{"text":"We came here as a large group for Summerlicious. I had been here previously and had a great time with really good food. This time though, I felt that the food wasn't quite on par however the service and the ambience was great. 
Some of us ordered the caesar salad as a appetizer and when we took our first bite, we were blasted with garlic. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy garlic, but this was to the point where it was overpowering and actually became spicy. 
For the main, I ordered the ribs and I think I made the best choice out of the bunch of us, though I heard the salmon was also good. People eating the burgers were really disappointed and the steaks were overcooked (according the feedback from the group). 
For dessert, some of my friends and I had the creme brulee. They brought it out in 2 batches however they were in different size ramikins. Some people's were noticeably bigger than other ones. On a taste level it was alright. My other friend had Churros and they were delicious!
I don't think I'll be coming back here for summerlicious for the reason that the food was just ok. Nothing really memorable"}
{"text":"Cute, bright and loud.  Waitresses in little black dresses. That is the best I can say about the place. Food was barely ok.  Ribs no big deal and the Southeast Asian Salad I ordered came without the ginger, coriander, bean sprouts and salted peanuts advertised.  They didn't even put any dressing on it and once I asked for it the dressing didn't make it much better.  It was a lump of tasteless pulled chicken on some lettuce with some snow peas thrown on it.  Obviously no one in the kitchen has ever read the menu.  Plus - what bar doesn't carry bourbon??"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were recommended this restaurant by our air B and B host. The atmosphere is great it's very lively with an ambient vibe. I ordered a poutine for $12 and it's the best poutine by far that I'v had, it was extremely filling! We got a lovely bottle of red also for $37. The prices were very affordable my boyfriends dish was $26 for half rack of rips, chicken skewers and fries."}
{"text":"The main critic for this restaurant is the quality for the price.  It is very expensive and the quality in Mediocre.  I took the Filet Mignon and I found it too peppery on the top for my liking.  For $35 dollars it should be cooked perfectly.  The waitresses are dressed in skimpy black dresses, which my daughter said was sexist, and my wife and I concurred.  They were very friendly and the better part of the service.  The wine list is also mediocre and expensive.   We went because between December 24th and January 4th many restaurants are closed in Montreal.  I bet any other time of year I could have gotten a great meal for the price somewhere else."}
{"text":"Le pire endroit pour des cinq à sept. Extrêmement bruyant au point d'en devenir malade."}
{"text":"After eating more than enough fancy French food on this trip, we were looking for something familiar and simple. We went to Houston's in spite of the tepid Yelp reviews, and we were very happy with the food and the restaurant. We'd go again for sure."}
{"text":"Des steakhouse à Montréal, il y'en a des tonnes. Houston les surpasse tous par sa déco lounge qui éveille les sens, son personnel courtois et son impressionnant menu d'une qualité rafraichissante. Il y,a deux sections, une plus bruyant pour ceux qui ont le coeur à la fête et une section plus calme pour un repas plus intime. Tou est bon!"}
{"text":"Just visited this establishment for Winterlicious. The food was tasty and  lots of it! The service was great. We were greeted by the manager Nathan who chatted us up a couple times. He was very friendly  and made sure we had a great experience and were well taken care of. The ambiance was unexpected.  It had a slight retro feel to it but cool! Will visit again in the summer. They have a great looking patio!"}
{"text":"The patio is the only redeeming quality Houstons has, which makes it mainly an 'after work drinks' kind of place rather than a legitimate steakhouse.  My friends and I come here only for that reason.  We have a couple of rounds and some food here before moving on.

The inside if the restaurant is dark and has a deep red overtone making it look more like a club/lounge.  Music is super loud, it feels like they're competing with O&B. 

They have some decent drink specials (2 coronas for $10 on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, I cant remember) but the service is consistently slow."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food here is so, so good!! I got the California Chicken salad. Simply amazing chicken. Crispy and the best I've had on a salad. My partner got the prime rib poutine. Excellent! Great vibe, awesome atmosphere, tasty drinks. We also shared the Black Forest cake. Came with 2 pieces and was heavenly!! Great coffee too. Highly recommend this place and am looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the reviews. The food is okay, but over priced. I had the Leak Soup, which was good, and the spinach strawberry salad with grilled salmon, which was very good.

The best part of this restaurant is the waitresses. Very, very pretty."}
{"text":"Worst burger I ever had.  It was dry and cold.  Obviously it was made ahead of time and was just sitting around waiting to be thrown on bun."}
{"text":"Pretty casual atmosphere. Everything was well prepared. My New York peppercorn was very good. Others were disappointed in their choice and claimed it was a bit bland. Good variety on the wine list but they were out of most of the bottles so we we left with fewer options than listed but it was still good."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times against my will. Everytime I go out with my co-workers, we end up at this place. Their nachos are not bad, and the portion are quite satisfying. The beer is reasonable priced, but it feels like it was deluded in water (maybe it's just my impression..?).

The waitress are always nice, but their dresses makes me feel uncomfortable for them. Its almost like a classier hooters. 

I didn't find it to be overpriced to be honest.

The clientèle is quite depressing, you will either find boring business people trying desperately to impress random girls or mr. lifetime-gym-membership muscleheads with their tight shirts doing the same and girls getting free drinks from those losers."}
{"text":"Yay! Got there for a little 5@7 with friends and what a pleasant surprise for my wallet: between 5 and 7 PM a selection of drinks are at $5 and some appetizers are at $7. I had a Cosmopolitan, a glass of red wine, a beer as well as a beef and a tuna tartar. The service was quick, the food was ok .....At a decent price you get a nice spot for a little get together with friends.... I will definitely be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"Only got the salmon here (multiple times) but it is delicious! Take-out service is better than dine-in in my opinion since the service is so slow for dine-in."}
{"text":"Overpriced, and mediocre-to-downright unacceptable food. 80% of the menu--anything other than steaks and ribs--is simply disappointing; those 2 dishes are barely competent and still far too expensive. 
Perhaps you figure it's worth it for the service. Well, hate to tell you, but the service is not particularly able... This is a Hooters in all but name, with crappier food and waitresses who are no better looking. Did you really want to spend $60 for that?"}
{"text":"Did the trad burger. Good. Beef carpaccio was on the menu but the slicer broke. Tuna appetizer. Was really tasty and full of flavour. If you can do it raw that is. I loved it."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Poutine\" before leaving...an interesting take on it as it is Barbecue Style made with Prime Rib.  The meat was tender and the fries were perfectly cooked. It was an enormous portion..enough for three people or more to share.  The waiter was very attentive and polite and offered \"to box it up to go.\"  A solid four stars for the creative take on Poutine and attentive and polite service.

There are many dining options on the menu....so I guess this review is just for the Poutine!"}
{"text":"Bon nous avons seulement pris un verre à ce restaurant alors cet avis ne tien pas compte de la nourriture! 

Mais honnetement mon experience au houston a été très decevante ! Premierement, quand nous sommes entré dans le restaurant les employés etaient tous au bar a jaser et ils ont continué un bon 8 minutes à avoir du fun a place de nous donner une table. 

Finalement nous avons ete assied sur la terasse et la serveuse etait ultra bete ! Nous avons commander 2 sangria qui n'etait pas bonne et nous nous sommes finalement levé pour partir, car plus personne ne venait nous voir pour prendre notre commande ! 

Bref tout ca pendant le week-en de la f1 ! Je  ne veut meme pas imaginer comment est le restaurant pendant 1 semaine normale !"}
{"text":"No! This is NOT your usual Houston's known to us Yanks as a mediocre at best chain. This is a DJ'ed steakhouse that puts out a nice steak with good service. I had the fish, fiance had a nice steak. Both were really good. There's actually a DJ up front, which is fun. They took one look at us and knew we would not want to be too close to loudness, so they seated us in the back dining area. We appreciated that. People watching was fun and interesting. This is a good choice for dinner."}
{"text":"Very disappointing for a downtown steakhouse. More of a trendy Bay street after work \"hang out\" for drinks.

Service was average at best, definitely well below other downtown steakhouses. Music was loud - slanted towards R&B and rap, not my thing. Again - more of a night club atmosphere. Very loud.

They have one of the worst beer menu's in the city. Great if you like Canadian or Keith's. Why not have a few local craft beer options? All other Toronto Steakhouse have them.  

We ordered multiple appetizers for the table. Calamari was too breaded / over fried and the large shrimps were clearly frozen. Only standout was the beef sliders - these were excellent.

Steaks were not the greatest quality despite the $35 - $50 price tags. A few of the steaks brought to our table were also not cooked as requested (mostly more well done). Clearly disappointing for a steakhouse. 

I will not be back. Too much competition close by for a sub-par experience at Houston. The Keg is significantly better at lower price point and if I want a good high end steak, I will go to Jacobs. 

Want to meet people? listen to loud trendy music and have a boring drink? - If yes... Houston is for you!

BK"}
{"text":"We enjoyed last year when we came with a large group but last night meh never again.  Service was great no issue there but the food ugh steaks weren't great way too much au jus on a filet and veggies were I'm pretty sure a frozen melody at least tasted like it, zero flavour.

Fries even so salty yuk, we enjoyed our drinks.  Wasn't that busy for a Saturday night perhaps we experienced why."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends for drinks one night. I'd never been here, so I had trouble finding the front door, so if you're walking from the north, the front door is just past the patio on Yonge. *facepalm*

This place is very nice. I felt super trendy being there. The decor is classy and cool; even the bathrooms were cool. Seriously. 

I didn't have anything to eat while I was there, but the service was good. This place has a great vibe and plays some good tunes. I'd love to come back again!"}
{"text":"It's good! Service was ok and the food too even though I found it to be a bit greasy , the music is sooo good and the barman or woman is very understanding Because they made me a drink I didn't like not their fault I was ill
Advised by a co worker to get it and they gave me another one I like for free! So sweet of them !"}
{"text":"Pretty waitresses to the point where it was distracting. We came here around 630pm on a weekday. The service was really slow. It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks. 

I had the chicken tacos. The sauce was too heavy and the chicken was over-fried. Food was very average at best. While the place isn't overpriced, it's not value for money.

I wouldn't come here unless it's convenient and there's no where else to go. I'd come here only for happy hour, if there's a place near the bar for some simple bar food. This place is like a hooters+ but the food isn't as good.

It also took forever to get our check as there was a table of 10 where each person asked for a separate check and paid by credit card. The server seemed a bit stressed but still smiled when she came to our table to help us settle the bill."}
{"text":"Have walked by this restaurant countless times, but never actually gone in. Just happened to be going to a concert in the area, so decided to go here since I'd never been. It was a nice day, so we went out to the patio. Hostess was super friendly and quickly sat us at a table. 

For food, I got the Beef Carpaccio and the Sausage Orecchiette. The carpaccio was really good, with there being a light array of toppings to go with the beef, yet still giving a full dish feeling. The pasta was pretty good, but a bit one dimensional. Although it had different ingredients inside to give it some depth, it ended up being all one flavour. 

Service was okay, but definitely could of been better. Took quite a bit to get in drink and food orders, and the busboy kept bringing dishes to the wrong tables! (Not just us). Our server was quite nice though (which helped), and we weren't in a rush. 

Saw that others said the music was too loud, but the patio wasn't too bad. However, with the mix of street noises and the background music, it was still quite loud. But hey, some people enjoy that!?!"}
{"text":"HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.  Went to this bar because it was close to the Sony Centre and the menu choices looked good. Ordered the beef carpaccio, it was very good. Word of warning  though, if you're short on time don't order an appetizer. Apparently that gives them the right to start the timer from scratch after the app is served.  Received our starter at 6:10 and dinner showed up almost an hour later. We spoke to who seemed to be the kitchen manager, he apologized (defensively) but didn't even offer to take the extra glass of wine off the bilI that I ordered  because I finished the first way before dinner was served. The waiter was polite but he may do better working in a place where the kitchen is a little better organized. Decent food. Slow service.  My biggest beef (no pun) was the managers unwillingness to remediate. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and menu. Cool atmosphere and staff.

Here we go again. Another chain restaurant in Montreal with a large varied menu (that isn't a good thing for me personally). Ordered the burger that they would only cook well done. It was dry as hell. I had to ask 3 times just to get mustard. Service was good besides that.
Keiser bun trying to hide the fact the burger was horrible and very bad. Wanted to get the tacos but this specific Houston's didn't have beef tacos.
Beer was pricey. 8$ domestic pint. The 5-7 deal was 1$ off.
Good notes were that this place has an awesome decore.  And very nice vibe. Red Leather seats with a red glow from red lighting and huge bar. They had a Dj that was pretty crap. Im a Dj myself so am a tough critic. He's was a typical wedding dj that played old out of date songs and didn't mix well. Music was too loud as my group was there for a 5-7 to shoot the sh#t.
As for staff... mostly women. Pretty sure they give these girls free gym memberships when they work there. And there is a myth that if you work there long enough, they will pay to upgrade a certain part of your body to a larger size.. if you know what i mean. (Pure speculation and urban myth)

Location is great. Cool spot right in Sq Victoria. Lots of windows to look out.

Giving it 3 stars mostly because it was a cool vibe and cool decore, would recommend for a 5-7, but not for the food. Close to metro is a plus."}
{"text":"On our final night in Montreal we stopped in for dinner .We ordered the Houston burger and the prime rib sandwich with a few drinks , both were served in a timely manner and were excellent. 
It was a very casual yet fun atmosphere with modest pricing . The only reason I give the place a 4 instead of 5 was our waitress did a decent job of taking care of us but seemed like she would rather be anywhere else other than where she was .
All in all it was a very nice dinner and we would recommend them ."}
{"text":"My ~$20 prime rib poutine had almost no meat whatsoever on it, and that's the primary reason for my review score.  It surprised me that it had so little meat because the place is a steakhouse.  Everything about a poutine should be indulgent, and skimping on the marque ingredient here was incredibly disappointing.  You can just look at my photo and try to spot the specs of meat.

Otherwise I enjoyed the ambiance and service.  The decor and music has a fun vibe that almost makes the restaurant feel more like a nightclub, and people seem to come dressed for it.  I was easily the most underdressed guy in the restaurant wearing just a t-shirt and jeans."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. Burger was barely edible and I could not eat the Asian chicken salad because the sauce was so goopy and disgusting. In addition, the waitress was missing half her clothes and half her brain"}
{"text":"Good Place,Delicious food,Fantastic Staff,Pretty Girls,Love this Place .
Thx you Tony :-)"}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!

My server was extremely rude but I took it as \"She was probably having a bad day\" since I also work in Customer Service myself. I ordered a cocktail (French 75) and she brought me something else; God knows what. 

I brought it to her attention of what she brought me and then she goes \"Oh, there wasn't any white wine or champagne so they had to use cognac\" I was so shocked cause she could have at least informed me before making the drink. I was very upset at this time because she was very unapologetic about it. 

So I returned the drink, only for her to come back with a bill for me. Even though I didn't have the drink. To avoid embarrassment, I just paid and left. 

I've told everyone who has cared to listen not to go there. And apparently, I wasn't the only one who has experienced their horrible customer service. 

HORRIBLE would be an understatement about the kind of service you'd receive."}
{"text":"Jank! If you're are looking for super aged freezer burned steak with terrible service then this is your place!  

It's more of a frat house then a steak house"}
{"text":"We were group of co workers arrived for happy hour; we were seated by the window; it was a lovely for 10 people. The place was jam packed! The service was super quick. Most of us enjoyed our cocktails very much. I got the bijou tonic cocktail; it was perfect (not too sweet, not too bitter, not too sour). Appetizer: shrimp popcorn cooked with chili sauce and guacamole on the side. It was impressively delicious. All the flavors were playing harmoniously in my taste. Everything was great then my main dish killed my appetite. My tuna tartare was sad. The zing was missing in it, but the chips on the side were delicious. Overall, it was very pretty pricey for all the small portions of my dishes."}
{"text":"Spent a beautiful Wednesday afternoon having steak and mushrooms with a tall blue moon. Food was tasty and the  service was great. My mom loved the tuna tartar because it was full of exquisite fresh flavor. Nice place to relax downtown if you're in the mood for a nice meal."}
{"text":"The ridiculous music and it's high volume level completely ruined the experience. I came expecting to feel like I was in Texas. Sadly, the environment was far too... festive..."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Fun on a Thursday night for happy hour. All the tables are reserved ahead of time but sitting st the bar would be fun. Service was decent"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere with loud DJ and red lighting. Comfy lounge seating and fun young servers. Food is good, not outstanding. Steak frites was worth it, though it was quite salty. I liked the bok choi and carrot veggie mix, great crispy fries. Signature steak has lovely flavour and a good cut. Dessert was ok, the creme brûlée that needed a good few minutes to set before cracking at the top. Server seemed like she was under the weather and misinterpreted that we wanted calamari as a starter, never ended up getting those (wasn't in our bill). Wouldn't go back right away but was worth the visit."}
{"text":"Came to watch the Raps game last night at Houston. Started at 8:30 and on a Tuesday this place was really quiet. 

We started with the tuna tataki, which was pretty good. Had a little kick at the end. For an entree we had the Thai beef salad and the salmon salad. Although the steak was cooked the way I like, the flavour just wasn't there and the salmon had some bones in it -- a little disappointing. 

I've been here before for drinks and I think that's the best this place can do -- drinks right after work and then maybe venture elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"Houston ... we have a problem.

Went here on a business trip because it had the promise of very attractive women in skimpy black cocktail dresses. It only partially delivered. The wait staff wear skimpy black cocktail dresses that expose their cleaveage significantly. 

Drinks are pricey and ... tiny! Their cocktails are only half a glass. They only offered two beers.

Food is horrible. We had appetizers and I ate a fried chicken dish with white rice. Chicken was gross, undercooked with skin and bones in it. 

We were disappointed. Our waitress was bad and not very friendly. She could wear a black cocktail dress well but we'd rather have a better meal and ambiance.

Earl's in Vancouver is way, way better than this place. Their waitresses are gorgeous and don't expose their cleavage to look cheap.

The ambiance is like neon lights, loud music and cheap perfume in the air. Bad food and overpriced small drinks, maybe worth one drink to soak it in and move on to a better meal or bar with more options.

Otherwise, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Service was the main reason for the 2 star review! It was horrendous. Granted, it was a Monday night and they were probably busier than expected, and thus understaffed. But the server was not at all apologetic. 

We ordered drinks and food at the same time. A good amount of time after we received our drinks, our server asked me to remind her what I ordered, meaning our order clearly hadn't gone in yet!  When the food finally arrived, we were not given cutlery. We waited patiently and realized the server clearly forgot about us, so we took some rolled up cutlery off a few tables away. She never did come back with the cutlery. We then again waited to get the bill - she gave us one check instead of two and, upon realizing the mistake, crumpled it up in front of us. We would have happily paid together just to get out of the place!

I had the tuna tacos which were tasty but very small. You had to pay extra for a side. My sister did enjoy her chicken cacciatore. 

We were certainly not the only ones to have this experience on this particular night. Behind us, one member of a party got her food and finished most of it before the other member's food showed up. Clearly the restaurant was having an off night, but the way in which the problems were handled was not professional."}
{"text":"Great place for relaxing with good friends and catching the world cup games.  Waitresses are all pretty hot too!"}
{"text":"We went to this place last Friday because we were on the area and the decoration seemed very attractive from the outside.

The hostess of the place is the hottest and nicest girl I´ve seen working in a restaurant in Toronto. She gave us the option of sitting in the lounge, or in the restaurant, so we picked the lounge.

I loved the decoration; mostly red with modern accents. Houston looked like one of those trendy restaurants that Sex and The City showed. Even the bartender looked like a character from a funny sitcom: pony tale, bangs, matador attitude, and flirty with only girls tables. 

Although the place was really noisy, we managed to sit in the coach beside each other, facing the crowd while enjoying a Malbec (they have good selection of wines). It was fun to see the affluence of such diversity of people (office workers without suit and tie, couples, ladies night out groups, annoying drunks, and loners) enjoying themselves, and the live Dj's music.

We ordered a Tuna Tataki for appetizer, and that was the best part of our meal. The tuna was tick, cooked at perfection, and melting in the mouth. The greens that accompanied it where crunchy, fresh, and gave the perfect contrast. Amazing!!

The but came with the steaks... If the place is going to consider itself a Steakhouse, it must give the whole attention to the term the customer asks for their meat... My husband asked the Rib Steak, and I ordered the Prime Rib Au Jus, we both asked them to bring them Medium-rare. However, the rib Steak was overcooked, it was a Well Done term... Which was extremely dry, a shame because we could tell the steaks where good quality. Half of the Prime Rib was excellent, the weird part was that after half the steak, it was just red...

I liked the place and the modern-party ambiance, I just would recommend them to pay attention to the food they serve, because after all, it's a restaurant, not a nightclub."}
{"text":"The food was better than I expected, considering how yelp destroyed this restaurant. 

Pros: waitresses and busboys were very nice, food was good, fun vibe

Cons: napkins were dirty, meals weren't in sync, took 30 min to get our bill, overpriced"}
{"text":"I will keep this short and sweet. I went with a friend. Being a steakhouse, we ordered steak. I got the Prime Rib Au Jus and she ordered the Steak & Fries. I can cut my meat with a butter knife and ate the steak before anything else. It. was. THAT. fantastic. Prefectly seasoned, great cut, soft and delicate. My friend also loved her steak. Service was great. We are definitely going back for more! On the pricier side but it is definitely worth every nickel (you know, since we don't have any pennies anymore)."}
{"text":"This review is a tad biased, I suppose, because I have no idea what the prices of anything are. My brother brought food home, and I ate. 

Their beef carpaccio has really tender beef. I'll give them that much. I can't comment on how beefy it was, as it got mixed up with our bruschetta, and all I could taste was goat cheese. That being said, the texture of that beef was lovely. No tendons or stringiness. All meat.

Their salmon tartare tasted like salmon. Pretty much just salmon. I'm not complaining. I like the taste of salmon. I like that my salmon tartare has a lot of salmon in it. I'm not sure what else it was supposed to taste like though.

Their bruschetta was lovely. Goat cheese, onions, tomatoes, olives, etc. on a very nicely grilled crostini. Love the garlic on that crostini. Yum. I'm also a sucker for goat cheese.

Their lobster tacos had decent sized chunks of lobster, real lobster, in them. To be fair, I didn't have more than one bite of this, but I thought the lobster was a tad overcooked, and I've decided that after a few times having this combination, I really am not a fan of celery and lobster together. The strong flavor of celery overwhelms the flavor of the lobster. Looking at their menu, it says that the mayo was supposed to be spicy. This comes as a surprise to me as I detected no spice whatsoever. After having just consulted with my brother, he has informed me that his entire taco wasn't spicy either.

All in all, not bad, but I'd be surprised if I'd consider this worth the prices paid for the food."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicous '16.

I had the soup app, steak entire and cheesecake dessert.

The soup was really good. The steak was overly seasoned a little too salty for my liking. And the cheesecake was like any other cheesecake.

Overall everything was just okay, nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"We would have been better off getting cheap airplane food than wasting money on this place!

Walking through the Montreal Airport, there really weren't many options to choose from. The Houston Ave Bar & Grill externally looks like it would be an awesome place to have dinner and a beer before a flight. Our experience told us otherwise. 

As we walked in, there was nobody to greet us so we assumed it was seat yourself as many airport restaurants are. When my wife and I grabbed a table in the bar, we were then told we were not allowed to sit there, and had to go wait to be seated. The lady then walked us back up to the front and told us to choose whichever table we wanted (a little confusing). She did not give us any menu's. It was about 5 minutes later that our waitress finally arrived and asked if we had gotten menus, which clearly we hadn't. She was quite slow with the initial greeting, VERY slow to bring our bill, and the food was very mediocre to say the least. If we were in any type of a hurry, there was a good chance we would have missed our flight due to the lack of speed of service."}
{"text":"Service rapide et bien. Bouffe okay. Je trouve que Houston est une place le fun mais plus pour de jeunes célibataire qui aiment boire. On se croit plus dans un bar lounge que dans un resto.
Entrées: calmar frit ... Ce sont les même calmars que l'on retrouve pas mal PARTOUT, et tartare de saumon qui goûte carrément le sushi. Saveur de sésame trop présente, on dirait un sashimi. Moi perso, pas trop mon style' asiatique. On est loin du tartare du Leméac mettons.
Plats principaux: burger gruyère et champignons vraiment très bon et steak de surlonge et fruits de mer... Boff. La viande caoutchouteuse et plein de nerfs et l'accompagnement de pomme de terre farcie, pas farcie ben ben... Dommage.
Parcontre les desserts étaient bons; brownies et gâteau pudding et caramel excellent et pas trop sucré !
J'ai été là car j'ai gagné une carte cadeau de 50$ et de ma poche 73$ supplémentaire très dispendieux. Mais je n'y retournerai plus."}
{"text":"3 for lunch after sweltering on an AWFUL tour bus.  Were SO happy for a pleasant, air conditioned space , with clean restrooms to wash off the grime.  
Amazing \"Tuscan Salad\" with a berry vinaigrette and sticky sesame chicken were our favorites.  Also shared the calamari and beef poutine, both good, typical, nothing special, but perfectly satisfactory.  
Friendly staff and outdoor seating is available, on a cooler day."}
{"text":"Happy hour where they have drinks @ $5 and calamari at $7 is a great deal. Their main dishes are of acceptable portion size, but could definitely be bigger. Nice ambiance to the restaurant to. I had the lobster tacos and they were satisfactory."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Checked it out the day before Formula 1 and had the full size Tuna Tartare. We were recommended it by the staff and it was amazing. I feel bad for not taking a picture before indulging. Great food, great Staff, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fight your hunger. They demonstrate why hockey is a national sport. The burgers are over cooked and the chicken dry and burned. Funny though - the bacon on my burger was cold. Actually cooked earlier and stored till use."}
{"text":"VERY POOR SERVICE!  This place is lucky I'm giving them any stars. We were a group of 6, it took about 20mins after we were seated to get a waitress to come to our table. Once she got there we order food & drinks; drinks arrived a little late but the food took a LONG TIME. A equal sized group next to us arrived AFTER we did and they got their food before our table. When our food finally arrived it was ok, nothing special. Someone in our group ordered a medium rare rib eye steak that was very over cooked; any carnivore knows how disappointing that can be. 

We asked for the manager and he obviously had no clue how to deal with our situation. The restaurant was not busy; it appeared they had enough staff. The manager offered the silliest excuses. Very poor customer service. 

I wish I hadn't left a tip."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday wearing a hoodie and jeans without a reservation so I expected a wait.  What I didn't anticipate was the downtowners who came after us who also did not have a table, also had a party of 4, but was dressed for a Saturday night in downtown to get a table 30 minutes before us.  When I questioned the fact that our wait time has stretched for an hour I was surprised to see that only a quarter of the restaurant HAD people while 3/4ths of the place was EMPTY! When I asked why we're being asked to wait, the response I got was \"we're not ready to serve you yet\". I was about to leave for Biff's across the hall since I know their food and service were better when my buzzer to indicate my table was ready went off. I came in to be greeted by another host which was a lot friendlier and I decided to try the food and give it a full out review.  

To start, we ordered beef tartare since it was a favorite of ours and wanted to try it due to the reviews on yelp but found it underwhelming.  It had a flavor resembling something like cold corned beef for some reason... would not recommend.  We also ordered a side of nachos which was pretty decent but not for the price. 

We ordered 2 lobster and steak, both of which were cooked well but the steak quality was chewy - it didn't taste fresh.  The chef did the best they could with the meat they had but the quality of the beef was bleh.  I would imagine the chef to be able to make something better if the beef was decent. 

For dessert, we had triple berry crumble and sticky toffee pudding.  They were pretty good but nothing that stood out really... 

Will most likely not come back."}
{"text":"Service was great. Decor was wonderful. Ambiance was excellent.

But I ordered the Salmon entree and some draft beer, and then 10 min after I left the restaurant I had explosive diarrhea. Not sure what happened. I am afraid to return."}
{"text":"While waiting for our flight, we decided to have lunch at Houston's, an American restaurant known for its burgers. 

The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. 

For lunch, I ordered a French Onion Soup, which consisted of beef broth with caramelized onions, croutons, and gruyere au gratin. It was flavorful and I liked how it had a nice balance of sweet and salty. It was served with mini ham and cheese sandwich. I was surprised that the buns were buttered or toasted, how tiny the slice of ham and cheese were, and the cheese wasn't melted. It would have tasted better with a mini Croquet Monsieur / Madame sandwich.

My mom ordered the Caesar Salad, which consisted of decently fresh chopped romaine hearts, bacon, parmesan, and croutons tossed in a roasted garlic vinaigrette. I'm sure some people wouldn't mind that salad dressing. However, I felt that it was too garlicky.

My dad ordered the Prime Rib Sandwich, which consisted of thin sliced low grade quantity prime rib, caramelized onions, and slice of white cheddar. It was served with au jus, horseradish, and soggy french fries.

Next time, I'll probably try a burger!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I had dinner here tonight as we both received a gift card at a company event. The food and service were both quite average. Not bad, but the only thing I found overly memorable or exceptional was the Caesar salad. 

My filet mignon was cooked to my liking, but I found the quality of meat was not as good as expected for the price. It wasn't as tender as a typical filet (in my experience) but I did enjoy the Jack Daniels Pepper sauce. 

My colleague had the 16 oz rib steak, which he ordered medium - it came med rare, which I think was a forgivable error ;) Wine list was decent, but no half-liter option available. We 'settled' for a couple of 9 oz glasses. 

For dessert, we both had the crème brûlée, which was again, pretty average. Sugar crust was too thick, but the custard part was ok. 

I'd go back for the Caesar salad. :)"}
{"text":"The worst service imaginable.   Sat for 15 minutes, got up and left.   Grab something from the vending machine, you will be better off.  Avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"Drinks were really good, staff were reallllllly easy on the eyes and very efficient. Unfortunately extremely limited menu (1 page only, about maybe 12-14 items total food wise)...i have never had the experience of literally not wanting anything at all from a restaurant...we were starving though so got 3 of the 6 appetizers offered: the nachos were 18$ for nothing spectacular at all...not even decent nachos let alone good nachos and for 18$ i woulda expected something better; the battered lime chicken thingies were by far the best no complaints here great sauce and very tasty (15$ for an ok-ish portion); the \"dry ribs\" appetizer was awful...worst ribs I've ever had they weren't tender, had to fight them off the bone and the sauce was mild, weak and disappointing. The bathrooms were shocking for such a nice place: difficult to find (downstairs to the right if u dare), pretty dirty (water all over the place full toilets including one broken toilet) and the locking mechanism is weird too. Would still go back for the extensive wine and drinks list tho that part and the service were awesome!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for an overpriced drink or meal. Only went here because location, but there are much better places in the area. The food is decent, but expensive. The drinks are expensive. The decor is too look at me. The music is loud. 
This is a bar that wants to be a club maybe."}
{"text":"The appetisers/\"entree\":

Caesar salad and a beet salad with candied nuts.  Can't say the caesar salad was anything to write home about.  Lots of lettuce, but the sauce was very bland.  I would choose a caesar salad from the Keg over the one here for flavour any day.

The mains:

rib steaks + mushrooms

The steaks were OK, but a bit bland, and the seasoning got very charred.  The fries were nice but very salty, but tasted good still.

The vegetables were nothing at all special.  Nor was the side order of mushrooms.  Tasted like undercooked mushrooms in a wet wine sauce.

Drinks:

The pomegranate martini thingies taste quite nice... berryful!

Sadly, over all I was not impressed for the price.  Would not repeat. Personally I think the Keg next to the Sheraton centre offers a more flavourful set of dishes for around the same price."}
{"text":"Service: friendly, but not very attentive.
Food: Hit and miss.
Value: if you value your money, spend it elsewhere.

We went for dinner around 8:30 pm and it seems we were the only ones there to eat. Plenty of people were outside or hanging around the bar and all of them were drinking. After 5 minutes, we ordered drinks and a couple steaks. The drinks and water came promptly and 30 minutes later, our medium rare steaks followed. Did they have to defrost the steaks first? Maybe sober up the cook? Why did they need half an hour to cook a steak?

Hit: mushroom covered strip was tasty and tender.

Miss: the marbled ribeye was fatty, flavorless and gristly.

Service: our waitress took our order, gave us our drinks and steak knives and long after our table was cleared and the hostess asked if we wanted anything else, she returned and presented the bill, which was wrong. She corrected it after the error was pointed out, we paid and left. Would we have ordered coffee, dessert or an aperitif? Possibly, if we'd been asked, but we weren't and instead we took the hint that they weren't interested in selling us food and left. But at least the waitress was friendly on the rare visits to our table."}
{"text":"Si vous voulez manger de la nourriture usinée, trop salé et pas fraiche, payer vraiment trop cher, se faire ignorer par des serveures mal à l'aise dans leur 'robe' trop courte et trop décoletée avec une attitude désagréable c'est la place pour vous! J'ai passée une nuit avec une intoxication alimentaire... Et le gérant 'marc' a été capable de rendre l'expérience encore plus désagréable. Stay away from this horrible place. Seriously."}
{"text":"Been here for drinks before and quite enjoyed the ambience on the patio. Went for dinner tonight. Sat on the patio again and they had a dj playing so it was loud but the music was good so we didn't mind. 

Menu is decently priced and they have $5 rail after 9pm which was a plus.

The hostess was welcoming, the food was good although my steak was overcooked but it still tasted ok so I didn't bother complaining. Service was painfully slow. The server was nice enough but couldnt answer any questions i had about the menu which were really quite simple. On top of that everything just took sooooo long. Mind you they weren't busy as I have seen them before. Maybe understaffed though. I'm not sure.

Anyways I would go back for drinks in the future probably not a full meal. Maybe service in the dining room is better!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Staff semi friendly. Ribs are definitely tender and do fall off the bone. The sauce I think is a bit mediocre.  Come back maybe but not running by any means."}
{"text":"I have come here in between train rides and also with groups of 2-3 and always enjoy the experience. The terrace is one of the best going as its one of the few in the business district of MTL. Haven't strayed away from the nachos so my four stars are for them."}
{"text":"Nous sommes simplement allés pour prendre un verre, et en entrant il y avait environ 22 employés en train de se parler ben relax. Ça a pris un bon 2-3 minutes avant que quelqu'un nous accorde la moindre importance. 

Nous avons pris deux verres de sangria rouges, ça a coûté 30$ et elle n'était pas bonne. 

Bref, expérience déplaisante."}
{"text":"We went to the Houston Ave Bar during Summerlicious. It was great; food and drink, attentive wait staff, nice surroundings. We had Caesar salad and Clam chowder for appetizers. Both excellent. Caesar had  grated fresh cheese  with bacon and croutons, all very fresh. Clam chowder was substantial and really tasty. 
We both had ribs, which came with coleslaw and fries.  Ribs were worth the whole Summerlicious fee; full rack of fall of the bone ribs with a good BBQ  flavour. Coleslaw and fries were also good. 
We had cheesecake and sticky toffee cake after this. Over the top desserts, both really nice. 
Great place, service was perfect not too fast so you would feel rushed but food was perfect when served. 
Would recommend it, especially during Summerlicious as it was a great price!"}
{"text":"I recently dined here with a friend for a Winterlicious dinner and overall, was underwhelmed and even disgusted at some points:

The service was terrible: We had 2 waitresses state that they would be serving us, and were confused when the other showed up to help. One of them kept forgetting her pen to take the order, then also forgot substitutions in my order, and requests to add on additional ingredients. Furthermore, the service was inattentive overall. 

For the appetizer I ordered the beef carpaccio and although I requested that the mayo and dressings be left off, it was indeed drenched in mayo and additional dressings. My entree was a very bland salmon with extremely bland green beans and a pile of unflavoured rice.My friend ordered the house caesar which was absolutely drenched in dressing, followed by the whole rack of ribs which was overdone, with soggy fries.

I was really hoping that the dessert would save the day, but unfortunately, it was brought out in a melted heap of whipped cream sliding over the side of a generic and poor quality brownie.

This was disappointing and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was a pretty neat restaurant. We just kinda \"found it\" without looking & it was a win. Can't mess with a cold Heineken draft.

Had the Calamari which was good but not great. The aioli mayo that came with it was vey good...nice little bite. Also picked up the Beef carpaccio which was excellent. Just the right amount of thin & tasty. 

The main was the 7oz Filet. It was solid tasting but a little on the small size. Don't get me wrong I didn't bring out a scale to measure! The side veggies were a little on the cold side. All in, this was a solid 4*. It would have moved to a 5* if the veggies were hot & the meat wasn't over done."}
{"text":"We came here for an office social dinner on a Friday evening. We had several rounds of drinks prior to our prix fixe menu which was $35 per person. 

I had a red wine sangria as well as a mojito. The mojito wasn't done quite right the first time.. Brought it to the attention of our server and shortly thereafter a bartender came to apologize and explained that they had run out of lime juice which was why it tasted so off.. He offered to make me one of his own versions of it and I could see if I liked it.. Great service. 

For appetizer I had the beef carpaccio.. It was delicious and surpringly a decent portion. For my main I had prime rib and mash.. And dessert was creme brulee. 

Overall, great experience and delicious food."}
{"text":"Colleagues and I were here for drinks and light dinner on a Friday 5pm, main purpose being drinks and hanging out, not dinner, hence the 4 star.  Good drinks menu and very nice decor and ambiance, love coming here ever since they renovated.  Very busy and as usual popular with the corporate crowd.  Had the sliders for dinner.  Average to slightly below at best as buns were all crumbly and meat was over cooked and dry.       Will not be having those again."}
{"text":"First strike, the hostess didn't even say hi when he walked in and just began leading the way when I told her the reservation we had, she practically ran there leaving us a great distant behind, then pointed to the table and walked off to the kitchen. 
Our waitress was fine she did her job not great but not poorly either. 
We were a group of 35-40 for a friend birthday and I needed to leave early for work. So my boyfriend and I ordered at 7:20 so I could leave for 8:30. Our entrees came I got Caesar salad, the dressing was  more like mayo then anything else and he got nachos that were pretty good. It took them till about 8 to clean our plates and then I had to ask for our main course at 8:20 cause I needed to leave in ten minutes our waitress had been a little MIA, I ordered my stake medium and got it rare, they also hadn't let it sit so it was very bloody when I cut into it, they did a poor job of Recooking it which cause me to send it back. ( she removed it from my bill ) my boyfriends stake was over cooked and not the best quality. The odd thing is is you go to a stake house you should be able to order a good stake, not here everything else on the menu was good just anyone who got stake wasn't disappointed. C'est la vie it happens but prolly won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had gift certificates for this place so we went after the hockey game, parking wasn't too much of an issue considering the location. First impression is this place looks rather swanky nice chairs and high tables at the bar area and a more secluded dining area, a lot more intimate a lot of red and black everywhere.
     
We started off with there signature sticky chicken and a salmon tartar. The chicken delighted all of us, little hints of lime and chill it was delicious, but the tartar fell short, it lacked salt and acidity.

Then we took a couple of burgers, I opted for the Houston burger, let me say it was fantastic the Boursin and the capicolo really elevated the dish, I was impressed ! Someone at our table took the steak and they said it was ultra tender! My gf took there bacon cheddar burger, she said it was over seasoned and the spice over powered it.

Now my favourite part, DESERT! We took the chocolate mi-cuit.... wow it was so luscious and silky smooth, it may have been semisweet chocolate but it hit the spot! And there was also a brownie dish with everything but the kitchen sink on it, also very good 
  
The menu doesn't really wow in my opinion but the food was average at best, the desert was my favourite part and the waiter was very kind we gave him a generous tip because he worked hard to satisfy!"}
{"text":"Great food - good selection of drinks, beautiful staff - killing it with awesome music on Wednesdays. Try the cod or salmon if you're not in a steak mood."}
{"text":"REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!
We went to ask in advance (a day before) if there was the possibility to watch one sport match specifying that was the only condition to go eat there; not only we couldn't watch it; the manager was so mean and kind of \"racist\" saying that the girl who took our reservation the night before was not the right person to ask to just because she was a girl."}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you have at least an hour to waste and are prepared to eat mediocre food.

It took them 10 minutes to seat us and 20 minutes before our order was taken (despite numerous attempts to call wait staff to our location at the counter). Most of the employees in the restaurant were walking and serving people with no sense of urgency (despite being inside an airport). 

Luckily, the order arrived fairly quickly (maybe 10-15 minutes later). Unfortunately, the burger was dry, overcooked, tasteless (and likely previously frozen). 

It took our waitress another 5-10 minutes to process the bill. She carried it and our credit card around the dining area fulfilling other orders while we sat waiting. 

Unfortunately, this is the only sit down restaurant in this part of the airport."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks after work and had a great time. Extensive drinks menu, excellent food (both the prime rib and steak & fries), and friendly service. The ambience is dark and red but also open and airy. A great place to start a night. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday! It was really good. We were 18 people and were very well taken care of in the back private room. The food was good and plentiful."}
{"text":"I came to this place with my colleagues for 5 à 7. They have 5 à 7 menu. You may get good deal with friends together. 

The portion is very good. I ordered an appetizer Nachos with a cocktail to start with. The main meal is saumon salad. Good portion to fill up my estomac."}
{"text":"more of a bar than restaurant but the food is solid; good location and fun spot"}
{"text":"This was a real disappointment; the meal began with one of the most lack luster Caesar Salads I have ever had, if you can't even come close then get it off the menu to spare the embarrassment of a bad review. Fried calamari appetizer was tender and acceptable; the strip steak I ordered was cooked to a perfect medium rare but lacked the characteristics of a good well marbled tender New York Strip Steak. The mashed potatoes and vegetable medley were pretty good but the star of the show missed the curtain call in my opinion. My son echoed the same sentiments about his meal, a sirloin with seafood in a wine reduction sauce with fresh vegetable and sour cream garnished smashed potatoes. His steak was tough and the seafood was lost in a nondescript rather insipid wine sauce, all was not lost though as the Sterling Reserve Cab I ordered was very very good. I have dined in several Houston's State side and have come to expect reasonably good food quality coming from their kitchens, this was a let down. My son mentioned that all the young women who worked there were absolute knock-outs each and everyone, the same attention to detail in hiring waitresses should be devoted to shaping up the kitchen as this was not your typical Houston quality experience."}
{"text":"Ok, problem No. 1, your locator is off and showing this location in Downtown Montreal. 

Two: I travel OFTEN and have grown a fond respect for airport restaurants. Do you know there are only two traveling types, departing or arriving and for more than not the airport is the last place people want to spend time in. It's not a fair ranking. I've had my fair share of delays, and I'll say this, I really appreciated my time here. I'm on my way home, and the practical French I know is running from me as I inch closer to NY.  However, as I sit here at the bar, the tender Giovanni isn't too overwhelming. He exhibits the perfect amount of hospitality. He doesn't ask why I'm traveling alone (for once!), and doesn't scoff at how a seemingly midgety bAsian can consume so much alcohol and food!  He didnt cringe at the awfully cold and on the verge of separating couple next to me or the strange man who snobishly asked to see the glasses before he poured his shots. This place is amazing, so everytime I find my lil booty here, I'm going to clear a chunk of that waiting time happily"}
{"text":"Randomly chose to come here with some friends one night because it was close to my office. I haven't really heard much about it so didn't have particularly high expectations. The restaurant was nice, there were lots of people and the decor was trendy and modern with lots of space which I liked. The service was good, our hostess was super friendly and our waitress came by just often enough to make sure everything was fine. 

I had the carpaccio to start which was decent. Sliced super thin and melted in your mouth.

The steak I had was pretty good. It's exactly what I would expect from The Keg or any other decent steak place. Portions were pretty big, I only ate half of it. 

For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding which was delicious! It was hot and just the perfect amount of sweetness topped with ice cream. 

I liked this place for what I was looking for that night which was just a super casual place to chill with good food and good company. I would come again."}
{"text":"Sat outside, some street noise, but that's ok.  Had a peach sangria, it was delightful.  Tito's and tonic was great as well.  Had the tuna tartare app while watching World Cup of hockey.  Tuna was excellent."}
{"text":"Notice no S? This is not \"Houston's\" (a US chain) it's HOUSTON - completely unrelated. The food here is mediocre - but priced like a high end steak house. 

The salads and dessert were quite tasty, but mains were disappointing.

While they claim steak is what they're \"known for,\" after spending $30+ for a 16 oz rib-eye, I can comfortably shoot down that claim. It was a cheap cut of meat which looked like it had been pan fried on a wet pan (steamed). No fire marks, no smokiness. Mushy with almost as much fat and gristle as meat - meaning I had about 9 oz of edible steak.

No bread. No butter. Sides are not included. I ordered a béarnaise sauce ($4) and it was obviously pre-made sauce from carton - not fresh.

My girlfriend ordered a burger. Tasteless and bland. Didn't finish it.

If it's a steakhouse, the steaks should be good. Especially with the high prices. It's just not worth what they're charging and if I were the owner I would be ashamed. It's a joke - or a really, really bad night with the chef on vacation.

Even the water tasted like soap. Served in a poorly rinsed glass.

Atmosphere was strange. Cool lights and design, but blasting dance music throughout the place by a live DJ made it difficult to talk to anyone else at our table. Service was spotty - performed by busty, leggy 19 year old girls barely contained in small black dresses. I suppose they assumed that would somehow make up for the poor food. It doesn't. I will never return."}
{"text":"Awesome. 

Beef tartare, incredible.   A bit of a kick but not bad, and I'm a suck about spicy food! (I also have stomach problems... ) 

Appletini also very good.   Only complaint is that they drizzle the caramel INSIDETHE GLASS... Looks pretty obnoxious licking it out! (but I did it,  ha ha!   That'll learn 'em!) 

Rib steak is incredible!  And DEFINITELY ADD BRIE to the steak... Never had it before.   ABSOLUTELY AWESOME... SERIOUSLY! 

Maple cheesecake, amazing! 

Hot young guys delivering food, sexy as hell! 

Waitress outfits were offensive.   SERIOUSLY, I've seen more clothes on hookers. Look I'm no prude.   But this isn't hookers are us,  is it?  So SHORT, so low cut, this isn't a strip club either,  is it?  SMARTEN UP!  Or dress the guys topless, with a bow tie and tight pants...!  You know, chip n dale style!  Otherwise it's misogynistic and sexist. 

Waitress in the bar, lousy service.   That's why this isn't a 5 star review. 

Because she ignored me so much, I missed the first Ten minutes of the Gordon Lightfoot concert. I was very annoyed. Caitlin G. should be fired. 

And.  To be honest, I love the music they play.   BUT.  It was too loud.   This isn't a night Club!

It's also TOO DARN DARK..... AGAIN, not a freaking night club folks.... Seriously!"}
{"text":"I came in here because it was cold, even though everything about it (the red lights, the blaring music, the cleavage) said it was not the place for me.

The music outside was much louder than the music inside, perhaps to deter homeless people from camping on the patio or to give the illusion of a party that wasn't happening. It was pretty cold and earlyish in the night, so it was mostly just a few lost souls. They have some very pro-Toronto decor.

I hope my bartender is going to mix a good cocktail, but that's not what they have to offer here. The bartenders do have boobs. A lot of boob action going on. And they are very sweet and happy to chat with you. There's an audience for that.

Their bathrooms are exceptionally clean. Five stars on the bathroom situation. Six stars, if we're comparing them to most of the bathrooms in downtown Toronto.

I wouldn't intentionally come back here, but ending up back at Houston wouldn't be the worst thing ever. I'd stick with beer."}
{"text":"I have been to Houstons a few times because it is close to my office however I will very unlikely to back as each time I have gone it has not been a good experience. In speaking with others I know they also feel the same. The service is very very bad. The girls at the front desk every single time look like they have no idea what to do and make you wait in awkward silence while they look at their computer screen for legit 3-5 minutes trying to figure out where you can sit. It's very strange and very obvious as this happens everytime. If you need a few minutes the figure seating out at least say something. They don't have good communication skills at all. The food is ok however on my last visit I ordered the chicken salad and the chicken was soooo dry that I didn't even eat it. My guest dropped his knife on the floor and not once throughout our entire meal did our server come back so he had to cut his meal with his fork. Lastly, and I know this is awful to say but legitimately true, the gentleman walking around clearing off tables had such a bad body odor that everytime he walked passed our table you had a very unpleasant lingering smell that was extremely noticeable that it was uncomfortable especially when you are there with a client. This same issue with the same worker happened also the last time I dined there. Management if you are reading this, it is vey unprofessional to have this as an ongoing issue while your guests are trying to enjoy a meal, with no knife and dry chicken. Very very disappointed as this place has a nice decor. The music is also way too loud as it's not a nightclub and people do like to have discussions over lunch. I will not return"}
{"text":"I kind of liked this place. Came here for a work christmas party. 
Started off with apps like sushi and sliders. 
sliders were awesome. I really liked the goat cheese in the middle - it gave the slider a good savouring flavour as compared to most sliders which just have 2 buns and a patty and they think it's the best thing ever.

We then had a prix fix menu consisting of salad, entree and desert.
I got the caesar salad, steak and fries and strawberry cheesecake.
Caesar could have used tad more dressing but not bad.
The steak in chimichura sauce and goat cheese & fries in truffle oil were awesome. 
I'm really picky about the flavour of steak as I can make a way better steak at home but I really enjoyed this one. I've been to Ruth's Chris and places like those and honestly I thought their flavour was bland. I would not pay $100 for a steak over there.
Strawberry cheesecake was the usual cheesecake. It was made perfectly though.

I really like the decor and the live DJ. The staff was super friendly. The waitresses were beautiful and friendly and always were attentive to us and accomodated as much as they could.

I give this place a 4 star as their beer selection was just the normal. As someone stated, they had no craft beers which kind of sucked. I love my beer and I've tried a lot of different varieties so would have been nice if I could have gotten a hoppy beer or something. I did like the fact though that they served it in a real pint glass. I went to Red's Restaurant last week for a christmas party and the glasses were tiny and they cost more. 

The other reason for the missing star is the wait time for the food was long. I think it took over an hour for them to serve us the entrees. I do understand though that they had a full restaurant and were probably understaffed. I also asked for medium rare but I got well done. I didn't want to send it back because at this point, some of us just wanted to eat and bounce. The flavour made up for it though.


All in all though, I would definitely go back here again. Maybe on a nice date or for their winterlicious or summerlicious menu even."}
{"text":"Came in for a drink sat at the bar, was helped by a really nice girl - Rae, maybe? Great convo, great wine selection, and good music. Not so busy for a friday though"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night after my boyfriend's Christmas party. We were in search of something nice and stumbled upon this and decided to give it a try. 

It was a pretty full house; we were seated on the tail end of a Christmas party who had a table to spare. The only downside - we were seated right next to the DJ booth, so conversation was a little difficult. When our waitress finally came around to take our order, we started with the spinach dip; it was pretty good, served with homemade pita chips. The serving of pita chips was off compared to the amount of spinach given. Luckily, when we asked for additional chips, they were given to us free of charge. For our main courses, I had the grilled chicken sandwich with fries (what pulled me in was the mango mayo listed in the description), and my boyfriend had the pulled porc sandwich with onion rings. In a word, I was disappointed; the chicken was overcooked and kind of dry. On the other hand, my boyfriend's pulled porc sandwich was actually quite good; it was flavourful, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. 

In all, it was alright, but nothing I would write home about. I would have much rathered The Keg or even Baton Rouge, given the prices this place charges. Our waitress was very nice, but because they all look alike, it was difficult to get her attention. If you're in the area, I would opt for The Keg over this place."}
{"text":"On our way back to the hotel from our dinner spot we decided to stop by this restaurant for a quick drink at the bar. The drinks were very overpriced and the service was quite crappy. Needless to say, if I had to describe the overpriced crappy drink I'd say most expensive little glass of Coke I've ever paid for. Did I taste Crown... Yeah I don't think so. The only reason I gave it a second star was because I thought the decor was great and unique. Even though I guess thinking about it for a steak house kind of disappointing it feels more like a club if you're coming here for that. Otherwise, location is great but there are better places in wonderful Toronto that one can visit for a better drink and service."}
{"text":"I was really surprised when I saw the other ratings for this place. 

It was a slow time at the airport clearly. But we were quickly seated and the waiter was really good. Gave us a quick opinion on several dishes my wife was considering. 

The food was a bit slow for the airport but we had told them we weren't in a hurry. 

The chicken burger was delicious as were the sweet potato fries. My wife's salad was great. 

If this was a regular downtown restaurant this would be 4 stars. Considering it was at the airport it gets 5."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night around 5:30PM and thought it would be more busy but glad it wasn't as we were seated promptly. The interior is chic. Hostess was very friendly. We were seated at a booth and it was not long before we had a server get our drink orders.

I chose to get the 9 oz. glass of Smoking Loon Cabernet Sauvignon for $15. It was tasty but I thought it was a tad bit on the pricey side for 9 oz. My friend got the Clean Slate Riesling 9 oz. for the same price.

My friend and I got the calamari that was really good and came within a reasonable time. Nice and crispy served with a spicy mayo for $12.75. For our main entrees I got the beef sliders with sweet potato fries for $13.00. The fries were good and I did somewhat like the sliders but it felt like the patties were from a frozen box which made me sad because I expected more from a place like this. The buns were a bit too dry for my taste. My friend ordered the lobster tacos and she did like the tacos somewhat but each taco probably had about 0.5-0.75 oz of lobster meat. If you're looking for lobster tacos please don't get them here and go to a restaurant that's known for seafood. There are plenty in the GTA.

Overall I probably could have had the same meal or better at a Shoeless Joe's or Turtle Jack's for the same price."}
