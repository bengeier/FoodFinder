{"text":"Just wanted to update this highly marked review I had made 5 months ago.
I placed an order today and they they made a minor mistake. So I called to let them know(no big deal) I asked for the on duty manager and the business owner was the one who answered. I told him what happened and he told me \"sir I made them and I made them correctly\" ....
Excuse me? really!!! 
This conversation went on for a a couple minutes. I even rephrased how I said it and he would not budge. 
In his eyes, he is right and the customer is wrong. 
This is NOT how you treat customers. 
A simple \"sorry sir\" would of sufficed....
I'm not looking to get freebies just wanted you to get a little feedback to help future customers. That is all.
Just to add I will NEVER order here again."}
{"text":"been ordering from here for a few years... pizza,  pepperoni rolls, wings, & salads are great.  Best Ranch dressing around.  Hoagies are so so... Delivery usually 45 min- hr but typically with the wait"}
{"text":"Complete failure.  They were our \"go to\" for pizza and wing delivery for almost two years.  After waiting over an hour we decided to call and see how much longer it would be and were told they never got the order.  We told them we had the email confirmation from the online service and they said it \"wasn't their problem.\"  We told them that their old online ordering system worked just fine and that we wished they hadn't switched.  Salerno's response was \"oh well.\"  We checked with the online service which is mypizza.com and they said their system showed the order had been received.  They said when they get the order they fax it to Salerno who in turn has to respond with a confirmation code indicating the order was received.  This was all confirmed.  The online company apologized and said they would follow up with the manager tomorrow.  We cancelled and asked for a refund and told the online service that they were disrespectful and rude.  We will not order from them again."}
{"text":"I've been living in Bridgeville for five years, and started ordering from this little shop across the street from my apartment before it became Pizza Salerno. I must say, Pizza Salerno is unbeatable! Their pizza, pepperoni rolls and even pasta dishes are AMAZING! I order from here at least once a week. Everything is CONSISTENTLY done TO PERFECTION. Can't even call it a guilty pleasure; it's so good that I can't even feel guilty!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from here regularly and used to rave about this place.  Everything we've had here has always been good.  Last night we placed an order and spent over $60.00 on food.  We ordered via Grub Hub and got the wing zings which are breaded spicy wings.  We ordered them a few weeks ago and they were amazing.  When you order it forces you to choose a sauce so I picked the same as I did last time and they came correctly - breaded, no sauce on them.  This time they were covered in sauce and awful.  We called and told them we didn't like them and were basically told well we made them the way you asked for them so not our problem.  We told Grub Hub our order was wrong and their customer service called me IMMEDIATELY!  They apologized, issued us a Grub Hub credit and said they would call them as well.  They were told the exact same thing - not our problem.  We were placing orders here regularly, but after this horrible customer service experience we won't order here again.  You don't tell your customers it's not your problem."}
{"text":"Super yummy wings, only iffy thing was to maybe coat them more evenly cause it seemed like just poured the sauce on top. Still really good and a good size too, I didn't have any really tiny hot wings.

I ordered the cinnamon sticks in the dessert section and got a hugely awesome portion! Yeah they smell awesome too.

I ordered through grubhub and had fast service. :)"}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with the comment below.  Talking to the manager was like talking to a wall.  All he could say was 'miss, I made it correctly'.  Where I come from, the customer is always right, no matter what. He offered to give me a $10 food coupon on a $55 order that was completely messed up.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, ever"}
{"text":"This place is my \"go to\" delivery spot for Pizza and Wings all for around $20. If you live in USC or Bridgeville surrounding this is the best pizza around."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place to order from- tasty pizza, quick delivery. No problems when we paid with credit. But the last two times we left our babysitter (grandma) cash. The drivers tried to get away without giving her ANY change. Very rude to her when she asked for change. I called to talk to a manager. He offered no apology whatsoever, just asked our address and said he'd talk to the driver. Again, no apology and no offer to get back to me, etc. Trying to rip off a grandma (twice- gave them a pass the first time) plus not even uttering the word \"sorry\" equals no more business from us. Plenty of other places to order from."}
{"text":"The pizza-breadsticks & wings were fabulous. The sauce was plentiful and the cheese smothered the pie perfectly. This was our first time trying them and we can't wait to order again."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal nor bad delivery.  And they deliver to my part of Upper St. Clair! Thank goodness!  

Common ingredients, but the quality/price ratio serves it's purpose and is better than most.  It tastes like central PA.  And I like it more than enough to skip over closer places such as my darling Parma - frequently.

We really like Salerno's Stromboli.  Seriously considering teaching them the secret to My Place (in Mechanicsburg, PA -see my review of My Place) so that I can have the central PA style to which I am accustomed.  In the meantime, I just order ham, capicola and pepperoni and add my own yellow mustard.  I'll have to send a sample for them to replicate the super thin \"My Place\" Stromboli crust.

Overall, superb value, reliable delivery, very tasty pizza, Stromboli and calzones.  I haven't tried any of their hoagies, meals or salads yet."}
{"text":"Have used for the past year. Drivers are always pleasant. I think they know we tip very well.  Yesterday the pizza took 45 minutes to arrive and it was cold and tough! When we called to tell them, the person on the other end of the phone did not care. Looking for a new pizza outlet to use. It seems that they are busy enough to blow off good customers. As their indifference continues so will their decline in business."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome pizza. The seafood pizza is very good. The Calzones rock it hard. The hoagies are pretty tasty as well. The owner makes pizza like an artist."}
{"text":"They DO NOT GIVE YOU RANCH/BLUE CHEESE WITH AN ORDER OF WINGS. If you do order of wings, Ranch/Blue Cheese, is only given to you by request, and it's ONE SMALL container regardless of the size you order.
So, you can order 6 wings, but they don't provide any free dressing. When you order
extra, you only get ONE SMALL ranch/Blue cheese per order of wings regardless of size. You can do get 6 wings + sauce and you will get 6 wings and 1 small sauce. You order 30 wings with sauce, you still ONLY GET ONE SMALL SAUCE. Also, they have continually mistaken my orders, but I failed to promote the issues....."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews, but the Sicilian Pizza was the worst pizza that I've ever had. I'm guessing that the dough is frozen. Bland and terrible. Do not eat here. There are plenty of better pizza shops in the area. We also had hoagies and they also were sub par. I have no idea how this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Negative 5 stars. Good.  LORD.  This might be the worst pizza On earth.  Tastes like it's starting to ferment.  Ordered 2 pizzas last night.  Couldn't even eat past a half of a piece....wow. Horrible."}
{"text":"I really like their food, and they don't whine about taking/delivering orders, even if it's close to opening or closing time! What more could you ask for from a pizza place?"}
{"text":"I ordered a Ranchero chicken pizza from this place and got barely anh chicken. We counted one piece per 3 slices. I am a regular customer and order two or three times a month. I called to tell them about it just so they know. I never even asked for a discount. The manager told me to stop calling because we always complain and hung up! This was super upsetting because this was our favorite place around but the quality has gone down. Very rude managers and they cut on quality. Avoid avoid avoid"}
{"text":"I just want to say how fantastic everything I have ordered from Pizza Salerno has been! From their pizza to their wings, I have never been disappointed. I have only had  one small problem in years, and management took care of immediately! Their delivery time is much shorter than any local pizza shop also which is an added bonus. I highly recommend them and I do not usually review anyone good or bad. Keep up the good work Pizza Salerno!!"}
{"text":"These guys are ridiculous. We order from them frequently and this is the second time it has taken   Close to 2 hours. Said the driver left 15 minutes ago and  they are 10 minutes away. They are rude! Just told us to order from other places.Ha! Bad business ethics, bad attitude and arrogance . Don't bother ordering. They clearly don't want your business. I give you 6 months before you go out of business. Get a grip. Keep looking people! I don't want to even want to give one star."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza from here before and it was just okay, it used to be better with different owners. Ordered last Saturday and should have called to complain. Ordered 2 pizzas with 2 toppings they were over an hour for delivery and they were terrible. One was sausage and onion there was barely any of either topping on it. The other was pepperoni mushroom which was a little better but not much both were pretty bad, too expensive and took way too long. I threw out the menu."}
{"text":"Everything that I have ever had from Pizza Salerno is amazing.  My specific favorites would be the Cheese Lover's or the Greek Pie. They also have the most amazing homemade Ranch dressing, everyone that I have try it falls in love. Fantastic job!"}
{"text":"This is the first place I ordered from that actually delivered before they said they would. They quoted me 30-45 min and were here in 25. When you are starving that's HUGE.  This was my first time ordering from here and the gyro was great and the pepperoni and green pepper pizza was delicious!!  My new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Best takeout I've had in a while!  Pizza, hoagies, specialty pastas are all fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"In town on business and ordered the steak hoagie half size...great sandwich...best part was I ordered online and it was made to order and ready for me when I walked in...for out of towners just know there are no tables for eat-in and no chips etc...to get with your order."}
