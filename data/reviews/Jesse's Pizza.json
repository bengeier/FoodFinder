{"text":"Ok , I know some people are gonna disagree with me, but I was so disappointed in Jesse's Pizza.  After reading the Yelp reviews my husband and I (both NY natives) couldn't wait to try this place. When we pulled up and went into the small take out style pizzeria, the smell had our mouths watering.  They had a great special going, $5.01+tax for a 16 inch cheese pizza. We bought 2 pies and went home to enjoy.  To our dismay , the crust was tough, there was not enough sauce and cheese on the pie... and the taste was average.  Don't get me wrong, its not terrible and for $5 its not a bad deal.  However NY style pizza \"it ain't\"!  Its thin, buts the sauce & cheese distribution on the crust is insufficient and the pie is not even greasy!  If you know NY style pizza, then you know about flavor factor of the grease. When you fold a slice of NY style pizza in NY.....the grease drips on your paper plate. If you want NY style pizza.....keep looking. I'm just sayin!"}
{"text":"Another $5 pizza deal! And a good one too.  The pizza had a thin crispy crust but it was bland and had no real taste. It didn't taste bad, it just wasn't the flavorful aromatic crust you get from a coal brick oven. This is about the only thing that's not so positive.   The sauce was a pleasant surprise, sweet and tangy without being very acidic or spicy. The cheese was just the right amount I think and tasted fresh and had good texture: soft and not very salty.   A big plus is that the pizza is not greasy or dripping with oil. I can eat a whole pizza and feel happily full (takes a big amount of food for me to feel this way) without bloating.  The garlic bread is good: better than average and the garlic is not overwhelming.  For $5 it's pretty good pizza. I'd still prefer the Pizza My Dear $5 pizza (served 12-4) but Jesse's Pizza is not that far behind, only its bland crust holds it back."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast! I ordered chicken fingers and garlic knots. Both were fantastic and their prices are great!"}
{"text":"I have lived near this place for two year and never tried it until now. The pizza was very good and reminded me off when I lived in new York. It was inexpensive and I will definitely go back again. Wayyyyy better than Pappas John's or dominos and the price point is almost the same."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Henderson since I moved here.  I grew up on the east coast, NJ, where there's real Italian thin crust pizza. I even worked in pizzerias for many years in HS and college as a pizzaman, so I know good pizza, and these guys make a damn good pie!  So happy I found this finally after trying several other so-so places. Will definitely be my weekly pizza place. Really fast delivery too for a Friday night, and the pie was hot and the soda cold. Awesome all around. I don't think you'll find better pizza in Henderson."}
{"text":"Jesse's has catered 3 parties and has been excellent every time. The party goers rave about how much they enjoy the pizza, salad and knots. I always get asked \"where is this from?\" The delivery is always on time. It is extremely affordable. I highly recommend Jesse's for an easy dinner after a long day or for a birthday party. You will be very satisfied!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, and $6.99 for a large pizza should have been a sign... but it was after school, kids were hungry, hubby working late, I was doing billing and needed to get a quick fix and not waste the evening in the kitchen...  A frozen pizza would have been better than the flat, greasy, flavorless piece of cardboard I rec'd.  Domino's is right across the street and has deals for $7 that has flavor, or Fresh and Easy practically next door that has decent ones to bake.   I wish I could give a better review, but wish I had read an honest review first and am giving a heads up to all who are considering it (I didn't check for one first... sorry my fellow yelpers... so I deserved it)   I love to support the little guys, so trust me, Jesse's Pizza, this hurts me more than it hurts you to say such things :(  FYI the members of our family like everything from 2 crust meaty pizza pie all the way to thin crust veggie... it just has to be worth chewing & swallowing."}
{"text":"The staff seems extremely nice except for the man obviously, well actually hopefully is the manager who is yelling at his employees while I'm sitting in here. On a good note, I can't wait for my garlic knots!"}
{"text":"The biggest thing I miss about New York is mom & pop food joints.  I've tried dozens of pizza shops in town and this is the first and only one that reminds of NY. It's not \"OMG AMAZING!\" ... it's just great people, delicious food, good prices.  A good, normal, neighborhood pizza shop instead of Food, Inc."}
{"text":"Well, it's about time!  I found a decent pizza here in LasVegas/Henderson area! I saw Jesse's on Grub Hub and decided to try it.  We hot a large pepperoni/onion pizza and a chicken parm sub. I was shocked to say the least that is was not your typical Vegas doughy pizza.  It was NY style thin crust wit ample cheese and toppings.  I actually really enjoyed it!  The chicken parm sub was loaded with chicken and cheese and toasted beautifully.  It was all delivered still warm (though not hot) in 30 minutes  Needless to say, we will be ordering from Jesse's again!  :)"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! We have been loyal customers to this pizza joint for years until today.  They have grub hub on their website now for delivery and we decided to order that way thinking that they were no longer doing delivery (their delivery on the weekends is subpar anyway as it is usually takes over 1 hour).  So we decided to go that route and ordered pizza around 5:30 pm tonight.  When it got to be around 7 and the pizza was supposed to be delivered by 6:34ish per grub hub, we decided to call grub hub.  The grub hub number is busy.  So we called Jesse's pizza to find out whether the order was being processed.  We spoke to 2 different male representatives at Jesses and explained the situation.  They completely and utterly did not care at all and said that grub hub is having countrywide issues and they have our order but due to the issue with grub hub they cannot process it.  We asked if they could deliver the food and they said that they wouldn't.  So they have our order and have had it and we were charged for FOOD which we ordered but Jesses refused to give us the FOOD we ordered saying we ordered through grub hub which they newly added to their website. Pizza is great but funding a business with HORRIBLE foresight and an unempathetic attitude towards a customer is ridiculous.  Even more ridiculous is the complete lack of recognition that ultimately we were Jesses customer and not grub hub's!!  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Fastest delivery of any of the top 5 Yelp sites in Henderson. Very flavorful garlic knots."}
{"text":"Just ordered the large cheese pizza, probably the best pizza my wife and I have had.  Been in the area over 18 years. Customer service was excellent and the pizza was hot and ready to go. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! The cheese garlic bread is to die for, my favorite ever. Yummy food all around."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying pizza from this place given it's NY style (my favorite) but it fell a little short of expectations. The pepperoni pizza was quite greasy, I had to sop up the grease with paper towels. The cheese seemed like it was over baked and the whole thing also tasted a bit too salty. That's a shame because the sauce was amazing.   The fries and garlic bread were quite good. Don't think I'll be getting the pizza again though."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Chicken Parmesan sandwich is awesome too. Highly recommend Jesse's pizza. Much better than Metro in my opinion. Great value for the money."}
{"text":"I've probably ate at 50 pizza joints in my life so far and jessies is in my top 4 everything is great the knots the pizza is awesome thin chewy crust with thick cheese   By the way their large (16\") is bigger than a normal pizza places large (14\") and you get your money's worth  I try to order it once a week   I just wish they could be open 24/7 aha  Trust me you have to try this"}
{"text":"I used Yelp because I was new to the area and wanted to have pizzas delivered. Jesse's Pizza was a great find. Love the pizzas and chicken wings!"}
{"text":"My parent's love this place and now, so do I.  It is New York Style pizza (thinner crust and longer slices) very much like we got back home in NY.  Dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Sorry I had high hopes.. The crust taste bland the ham was gross and the sauce was so light you couldnt taste it.. Still like joeys NY pizza, Enzos, Montasedos and buna Gusto Better!! I tried just taste like cheap pizza.."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and after reading the reviews decided to order delivery from Jesses pizza. After waiting almost two hours the pizza showed up cold barely edible. As for the sweet bread puffs they were just as bad but chewy as if they had previously been microwaved. Suffice it to say we won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting it to exceed my expectations when I arrived, but if have to say I was more them impressed. Service was great. And the food was impeccable. Definitely will recommend, & obviously returning for more."}
{"text":"I've lived in Henderson for 24 years and have had pizza all over town. I love Jesse's pizza the best. Their garlic knots are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Tried it once........... never again. Really not good. I've had better pizza at a gas station!"}
{"text":"$5 pizza! OMG Garlic Knots!!! We're fans for sure and will order again. We just moved into Henderson and have been exploring places around the house. The pizza is pretty good, wish I would've known it was a thin-crust though but it was still good. The order was exactly like we asked, so were the garlic knots (must try with the white sauce) and a salad. 10-15mins for the pizza as we sat outside waiting. Will order again definitely!  Hours are all 11-9pm I believe everyday of the week. Wish you guys were open later than 9pm, least on Fridays/Saturdays, we'd go with you guys rather than someone else"}
{"text":"Best chicken finger sub in Vegas. Reminds me of a back east sub. Very fresh roll and good quality ingredients. I have ordered multiple times and never been disappointed. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Food was really good for the price.  We got a large cheese pie, large french fries, mozzerella sticks and a 8\" meatball sub, delivered, for $22!  Awesome deal, good food, fast delivery.  Everything was still hot and crispy when it arrived.  I think we found our new go-to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent as well as the apps that I got...I'll be ordering from them agian  Menu: Half tomato and mushroom half cheese pizza Mozzarella sticks  Chicken tenders  (mild sauce) French fries Sprite"}
{"text":"Convenient little pizza joint for those who live around the Horizon Ridge area. It isn't the absolute BEST pizza, but the quality is still pretty good here.  I usually opt for the classic pepperoni pizza and some wings. Pizza usually comes out quickly and the staff is friendly.  Sometimes when I don't feel like driving, I call in for delivery and usually the pizza comes in hot!  Quick delivery, hot pizza, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I like to get pizza delivered to me sometimes and this is my favorite, their garlic knots and wings are good as well"}
{"text":"So I thought I would give this place a try since I was in the mood for some wings. First, it was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. Now what it was delivered in was making me think twice about my decision bc it showed up in brown paper bags that were covered in the sauce and in the little trays you get when you are at the restaurant. Now I'm not that picky about packaging as long as the food is good and they didn't disappoint. The wings were juicy and coated nicely.  I had medium and bbq wings and I was very satisfied. My only suggestion would be to change the medium used to the deliver the wings in. Hats off to Jesse's, the wings were good and reasonably priced. Thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"This is a year of pizza adventures.  My next stop was Jesse's Pizza.  It's very convenient to my home so I wanted to try it out.    We called to place an order for delivery.  The gentleman was very pleasant to speak with.  He repeated our order to make sure everything was correct.  The delivery was right on time as well.  I always appreciate punctuality.    To start we saw some pictures of the Jalapeño Bacon Knots.  Oh yum.   Every bite was perfect.  I loved the flavor because you can't go wrong with bacon.  We had a lot leftover so we froze them for a later date.  They reheat really well so that was a sure win.  For our pizza we opted to try two~ The Hawaiian and Meat Lovers. They were good.  They did not skimp on the toppings which is nice.  The very center seemed to be a little limp and soggy but it was only on the first bite.  I was surprised that the meat lovers was not greasy.  Even the box was not which was a good sign.  The pizza did not reheat as well as the knots so eat the whole thing if you can.    I can always support the local business! Thanks Jesse's!"}
{"text":"Jesses pizza is great! Always satisfies my pizza cravings and their wings are delicious!!! Will always order pizza and wings from them, they also have great ranch and fries. TWO THUMBS UP"}
{"text":"No nonsense, no frills, just place your order and pick up your pizza kind of place.  Service has always been consistent. Friendly and fast. Averages less than 20 minutes each time I have placed an order there.   Pizza is NY style, thin crust, chewy texture. Sauce is smoother, slightly sweet,  not  the tomatoey tart canned kind. Cheese nicely brown and bubbly. Toppings are fresh, but I wish there was just a little more. I had mushrooms.    It's a big  plus though that they have kept their pizza at the same prices for years even when the cost of everything else has been creeping up. For what they charge heck ya it's great deal for good pizza that's made practically from scratch!"}
{"text":"So I had to write a review about the homemade sauces at Jesse Raes bbq. The award-winning God sauce is very addictive it tastes good on every side every piece of meat they have I personally love the more vinegary sauce its  the god sauce . little bit more vinegary .tart and it's awesome. The Fallen Angel is God sauce but if you like hot and spicy this is the one I love all of them equally I couldn't decide and pick one if I had to also the saw that he puts on his coleslaw is amazing and I do not like coleslaw or mayonnaise I have never had a sauce in coleslaw that I have loved like this before that's not even getting into the tender smoked meats that are cooked daily fresh for hours every day and the sides which are made with loving care the owner Mike Ross has a good attitude a lot of passion is very generous in portions and in making his customers happy he also wins lots of awards in local BBQ competitions on the west coast and gives to many charities so it's a really good place with the really good cause and you have to go try it once and see how you feel for yourself"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was great. Pizza was fresh and the salad portion was huge. Can't beat the price either."}
{"text":"Our favorite local pizza place. They use fresh ingredients, like thick slices of tomato (which can make the pizza middle too juicy) and mushrooms. The zeppoli are delicious, but eat them fresh--they're not great as leftovers."}
{"text":"Needed to find a new pizza joint. The one I usually order from made some changes. Prices went up and food quality and service went down. Not a combination I am willing to pay for. Tried Jesse's and loved it. So far everything we have ordered has been good. Pizza, meatball sub, wings, fries, salads, etc...  My kids really love the cookie pizza. A nice little bonus is their ranch is good and they don't charge much for it. I'm actually not that close to them but they still deliver to my house. It usually is here pretty quick and everything is always hot. The place I used to order from is right down the street from my house and half the time the food was still room temp.   I'm glad I found this place and I will continue to order from them."}
{"text":"All the reviews are correct: it literally DRIPS grease. It did arrive hot and in a timely manner. The garlic knots are pretty damn good though. I would go for those again."}
{"text":"This is a thin crust pizza with a somewhat average flavor. It is however a very good deal and we fed our entire volleyball team for next to nothing. We spent about $60 for 5 16 \" pepperoni pizzas and 2 trays of Caesar salad."}
{"text":"My whole family enjoys a good slice o' pie from Jesse's. We used to live close by, so often it was our Friday supper eaten during our movie night. I've been craving it (along with their soft, delicious garlic knots), so I think I'll be making the special trip for a fix. Love supporting this local business!"}
{"text":"Flavorful, fresh and filling. No skimping on the toppings like so many other pizzerias. This is the real thing. Delicious"}
{"text":"Good pizza. The only reason it didn't get five stars is cuz the pizza wasn't cut through all the way so I salvaged a lot of my toppings out of the box.   Ordered a side of meatballs just to try them. Dense, so not for the lighthearted, but damn good flavor. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"They were right on time. The pizza was awesome. We ordered chicken wings and they were great. Really happy!"}
{"text":"I personally like my pizza thin so I enjoyed Jesse's pizza. The pizza is, however, a bit more on the greasier side than I would prefer. I think the pizza is pretty decent but maybe not the best out there."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great service. I ordered through yelp too, and they called to confirm it. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decent greasy pizza with a light flavored tomato sauce. I only went there because bistro Pizza was closed. Was hoping I found a second choice for pizza after them. too bad I did not. ?"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pizza place but the last few months every time I order the delivery takes up to 2 hours to come. We always call after it has been an hour 1/2 to an hour and 45 minutes they never apologize or act like its a big deal. They just tell us it's on the way. Pizza is great but this is ridiculous I won't be ordering from here anymore!"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza in town but definitely not the worst.  Thin crust, delicious cheese, toppings are tasty, and the pizzas are relatively cheap, especially if you just get a large cheese for $9.99.  The large cheese used to be $5.99 way back but after a few price hikes it is still relatively reasonable.  Enough for two people or one fatty, a.k.a. me lol.   If you are into garlic knots, the ones here are pretty good as are their subs.  This was here before Bistro Pizza but the two are very similar in my opinion.  The staff are friendly and the pizza is quick and easy."}
{"text":"The delivery driver was very nice. The ranch was good. The pizza...eh. Nothing about it made me want to order from there again."}
{"text":"Jesse's Pizza is consistently  excellent in quality, speed, and friendliness."}
{"text":"You should check this place out. Amy's co-worker, Kim, brought pizza for us. We got a Supreme Pizza, Jalapeño Bacon Garlic Knots, and a Dinner Salad and it was so delicious. You should try it. My favorite part was the Jalapeño Bacon Garlic Knots."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and chicken wings and when I received my chicken wings they were not even in a take go container? They were in a serving boat like you get an elementary school or a food truck??? I have never received chicken wings that were not in a to go container? All the sauce is stuck to the top of the bag and my chicken wings were cold? I called the manager and he said that this is the way they have been doing it for 13 years and that they have never had a single complaint on how their chicken wings are served?? I highly doubt I'm the first person to not appreciate that my wings were not in a container!!"}
{"text":"Well I am out here visiting family and was looking on Yelp for a good pizza spot. So you guys popped up with 5 stars. So i say lets try it out, got the meat lovers and the bacon jalepeno knots and man that was BOMMMMMMB I really will come back everytime..I applaud you guys"}
{"text":"A LARGE PIZZA FOR $6.99, SAY WHAT?!  That's right folks, how can you not give a place like that (5) stars.. OK, OK, there are some factors that could hinder such a fabulous rating, but not today.  I must say mom and I thoroughly enjoyed our Jesse's Pizza experience.  We enjoyed garlic knots (could use more garlic, but eh, I'm Italian and there's never enough garlic in anything), and the pizza was fantastic especially considering the price.  So we are not in NYC by any means but the ingredients were fresh, cheese was delis, toppings, and crust were beyond your $6.99 expectations.  Mom's new digs leave us minutes away from this new little pizza joint-jem so with certainty we will be repeat carb offenders here at Jesse's Pizza."}
{"text":"Jesse's pizza has its place among pizzerias. Better than Little Caesar's and Domino's, but not quite good enough to crave it on a regular basis.   It's affordable and that's important when you have a family. However, they must have raised their prices recently. For a large half pepperoni, it was almost $ 8.50. I swear that same pizza was under $ 7.00 a few months ago .  If they keep raising their prices, I'll go the other direction and go to Sunset Pizza instead.    What's that saying again? Pizza is like __, even when it's bad -it's good!  You fill in the blank- I need to keep it classy!"}
{"text":"I have to do an update based on how the pizza tasted the next day :( Usually with pizza it gets better the next day but unfortunately that was not the case :( My mom is the best cook and she can revive anything but when we ate the pizza the next day it was so soggy! We could not get it crispy for ANYTHING! We tried putting it in the stove and the toaster oven! NADA!  We were disappointed because the pizza didn't taste soggy when we brought it home but the following 2 days it was, nobody likes soggy pizza! Unfortunately, I'm going to have to agree with Yelper Bonnie P because I can totally understand where she is coming from.   Would I come back? Probably not, there a lot of pizza places out here with little room for error so when one fails you try another one!"}
{"text":"If you are in Henderson and need good cheap eats, this is the place.  The crust is thin, not New York style, more of a Italian style.  Nice crunch but not over baked where it's got no chew like a cracker.  They also put the right amount of sauce.  Warning, to some,  they add some sort of sweet spice that adds a sweet noteto the sauce.  The toppings themselves were good but not the best quality but at these prices, very little to complain about.   They also put the right amount of cheese, so the pizza stays together.  No dining in option. Only pickup and delivery.  If you pickup, a large cheese goes for $6, so call ahead and pickup.  The meatball sub was also a winner."}
{"text":"If i could give this dump neg stars, i would.....But lets go back to the beginning. Friday nite, down with a fx ankle, wife working overtime.Gets home...Hey lets order delivery..how about pizza?? Awesome. Lets find a new place on yelp...Awesome. So surfed around looking for delivery...found Jesse's. Called in, asked how's the pizza. Reply..BEST in HENDERSON. Cool large thin crust, ez cheese, sausage, onions, extra mushrooms. 45 mins later, pizza arrived. Wife scooped me up a slice..ONE FUCKING MUSHROOM,2 Sauages, NO ONION ANYWHERE. And that was just my slice. Called back in to Jesse's wondering how anyone could fuck up pizza that way. ANSWER...we were busy. BS...how can a pizza joint send out a shitty pie like this, i wondered. ANSWER...we were busy. FUCK..i called it in @ 5:15. Anyway the order taker promised to make amends..50% off next order + a gift card.   Fast forward to last nite SAT 9-3-16 10 days later, i wanted to cash in my offer. THE only reason..crust was VG.  Told no notes in my file. Spoke with JASON alleged manager...again no notes, best he could do was 10% off. I politely told JASON to stick it. Ordered from BISTRO PIZZA, proving why stray from a good thing. Dark spots on photo is burnt cheese,,,SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Ok... plain and simple it's great pizza made by good people.  There are numerous places throughout Vegas and Henderson to get pizza. But getting good pizza for a great price is very rare. Jesse's has pretty damn good pizza for pretty damn good prices.  Tonight I went with the large (16\") pepperoni pizza. If you're not a fan of thin crust pizza then this place might not be for you but if you love a good NY style thin crust pizza then this one is on point.  Crust is tasty, crispy on the edge and not overly soggy. The sauce has a good taste. Not overly acidic and has a good zest to it. They aren't stingy with the toppings. Cheese is fresh, stringy, tasty, and melted to perfection. Pepperoni is cooked perfectly every time. Wish it had more of that crispy burnt texture to it but with the pizza so thin it would probably burn the crust.  Overall I gave the pepperoni a firm 5/5 and for the prize of under $13 you can't eat it. Be warned though, if you're hungry you'll be able to finish off a whole pizza like I did! It's that addicting.  We also got the veggie pizza. Got the small (12\") and it didn't disappoint. Olives, mushrooms, onion, green peppers... yeah all that good stuff! The crust seemed slightly thicker in the small. Good thing it was.  Like all veggie pizzas, with all those veggies the crust seems to absorb all the moisture. If the crust had been as thin as the other pizza it would have been a soggy mess. I love the richer more savory style pizza so I would have had to add sausage or something to this one to truly enjoy it but if you're a vegetarian then this won't disappoint. Another 5/5!"}
{"text":"It was good lots of toppings . Was made correctly. Got here on time hot.  It was a friends favorit place. It was pizza"}
{"text":"I'm actually rather surprised by all of the positive reviews. I tried Jesse's, as I had just moved to the area and it was one of the few restaurants that delivered. The pizza was very greasy, and not something I would eat again. I will say, however, the garlic knots were a saving grace. They were delicious!"}
{"text":"Made a delivery order through yelp today. I have to say I'm honestly disappointed. I chose this place because it had 4 stars. Definitely a lie!  For one, the delivery took forever. The salad I ordered came soggy. The pizza was cold. The only thing that came out right was the soda pop."}
{"text":"Jessie is a friend,  Yeah I know he's been a good friend of mine  But lately something's changed  It ain't hard to define  Jessie's got himself a pizza  And I want to make it mine.  I'm not sure if the story is true about this place, but it sounds pretty historic for it's Nevada past.   In any case, their pizza is pretty solid for the price, and the prized meatball recipe is actually very good.  Now, I think about it, how does this place stay in business with Metro pizza in the same parking lot as them?   The word is Value!   Where else are you going to get  a $6.99 16 in  pizza in this part of Henderson?   The sauce is smooth, but not too sweet which was good.   Not to mention, they make a pretty good garlic knots.  There is a down fall for this place, if you order during their busier time, you might wait for half hour or longer on carry out."}
{"text":"The pick up special is an excellent deal, the sauce and cheese balance is perfect and the the crust is thin. It's pretty good and so are the garlic  knots. I much prefer this over the pizza across the parking lot ."}
{"text":"Being in Green Valley for 10 years and my kids going to high school and going to Enzos for many many years we've ordered pizza even though time and time again they been rude and tonight when Enzos wouldn't answer the telephone to take an order I decided to try somewhere new m. We placed a order from Jesse's the food was here quickly and we had the wings the garlic knots and two pizzas and it was fantastic if you're looking for a good pizza place that delivers anywhere in Henderson give this place a shot the food was fantastic and it was nice for somebody on the other end of the line to act like they appreciated your business you got a new customer!! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I can't believe this little hole in the wall is still here! I am telling you first hand that they use only the best products for their pizza as well as highest quality for everything they sell out of their shop. Darren and his wife are the most caring people you could meet in Vegas. I miss the pizza because there's nothing like it here in Cali. The pizza, chicken fingers, mozarella sticks, salads.. you name it.. it's delicious and very affordable. Darren keeps his shop super clean and they also deliver quickly so your food will be hot and fresh when it reaches your door. I can't wait to visit Jesse's Pizza when I come back into Henderson! This is truly a little treasure you should visit if you are in the mood for some outstanding homemade pizza not made at home."}
{"text":"How can someone call this a pizza?  Saw the deals and reviews of how wonderful this place was so I had to try it.  When I got my pizza I was not sure of what I was looking at.  The crust was soggy, cheese not fully melted, and sauce was memorable in a bad way.  I guess I got what I paid for."}
{"text":"We ordered a basic 1/2 cheese, 1/2 pepperoni and antipasto salad. Arrived on time, very fresh and pretty tasty. It is NY style so a little greasy for us but we just put a paper towel on it to get off some of the grease. Not knocking it though. Much better than typical Pizza Hut, etc. Would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Fingers, fries, wings, pizza? You name it they have it. We have them deliver pizza weekly to the office. Inexpensive enough to feed the whole office without sacrificing taste."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to give Jeese's Pizza a try. My family was looking forward to trying a new pizza place. We made a huge mistake! First off, the food was seriously referigerator cold. I optimistically felt that since it was Friday night maybe the driver simply had a full route. We reheated the food in the oven and gave it a try. GOOD LORD! Bland, Uninspired, just a very flat flavor in general. The chicken fingers were actually soggey. The wings were passable at best. The garlic knotts were ok. I don't know what happened to Jeese's quality from the last review I read to the time our food came but it was NOT what we expected. Who the heck made this stuff and where was our food prepared?!  Not trying to be amusing of funny but my son and I are experiencing some intestinal distress, my wife has heartburn and none of us are feeling very well at all. Tottaly ruined a great day. We are currently discussing the possibility of a late night trip to the ER.  Good luck to you all.                      Regards."}
{"text":"7/15/12 Located on the NW corner of Stephanie and Horizon Ridge. In the shopping center with Fresh & Easy next to Mi Peru and TaTa Bistro.  Parking was ok at night but other business's were closed. The shop is kinda hidden in the back so you gotta be looking for it.  A friend said they had a good NY style pizza and cheap, so I figured let's give em a shot to please my pizza desire.  I called in and wanted to pick it up and take a look at the place. Ok so I showed up in 15 minutes and went to pickup my $5.99 special 16\" cheese pizza. Trust me I was prepared with $7.99 worth if heartburn medicine. None needed.  The place is really plain and could use some character and I mean like a poster lot statue or anything. No dining room, but had 1 small table inside but looked like a waiting for your food spot not to eat on. There were a few tables outside where you could eat if the weather happens to be tolerable. So I asked and the nice lady working said its mostly for pickup and they do delivery in Henderson for orders over $12 and there's a $3 delivery charge which is really reasonable.  Pizza was like a regular NY pizza joint on the street all over USA.  Ok final results - taste was good, pizza was fresh, hot, good sauce not too overwhelming, cheese average amount good coverage, crust medium texture on the thinner side and was easy to fold if you get down like that. Very Good overall for what it is and will repeat. Excellent value."}
{"text":"About 15 years ago I experienced the best pizza I'd ever had. It was in a cafe in, of all places, Edinburgh, Scotland. The taste of that pizza has haunted me for years. I've never found an acceptable substitute.  Until now.  I really don't know what it is but Jesse's Pizza does it. The cheese maybe? The sauce? I've not had much pizza in NYC so I can't compare but maybe this is the taste the people from there rave about.  I'm so hooked on this stuff I usually order at least once a week (large cheese, extra cheese - hi guys!  :-) but I have to be careful not to overdose. I'm mildly lactose intolerant and if I eat dairy too often I regret it.  I obviously can't eat a 16\" pizza by myself but it's hard to meet the $15 minimum delivery charge without ordering other food that doesn't really last (salads just don't keep well). And the cheese-only doesn't reheat well at all. So today I tried a half cheese and half loaded. I snarfed most of the cheese and it will be interesting to see how the loaded reheats for tomorrow's lunch.  Would love to see some other dessert options. No offense guys but those zeppoli are like sugar-covered bread bombs."}
{"text":"The garlic knots are the best. My family and I love them. The pizza is really good. It's ultra thin. Get the garlic knots!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Lucked out - first pizza place we tried since we moved here. So happy to have found a place that makes amazing pizza!  We ordered a large pepperoni mushroom for delivery, along with an antipasta salad. It arrived about 20 minutes after we ordered. Hot and fresh.  The sauce on the pizza was so good - tangy and flavorful, with a yeasty thin crust - not so thin there wasn't substance to it though.   The salad was fresh and good.   Definitely will be the place we turn to when we're ready for another pizza, although we'd like to try their other menu items as well."}
{"text":"All I can say is, Are you kidding me? This place never dissapoints. The pizza and Knotts are incredible, so we tried today a chicken parm and meatball parm sub. They have two sizes 8in and 12in. We went with the 12 in and WOW best subs from a pizza place you will ever find. My son is a meatball sub snob. If it is not good he is quick to tell us but not from here, he loved it and said this thing is huge there is no way I will finish. Lol, leftovers he said. Check out their facebook page because every friday they have a number contest with the person the closest gets a free pizza. I actually won woohoo!!! Prices are cheap and food is excellent. Stop in and enjoy. This is now my number one pizza joint."}
{"text":"Wife wanted to try something different than the standard marcos or pizza hut. Delivery was quick but pizza was terrible.  Not often id prefer red baron over a delivered pizza.  Special was for 20 wings which also were overcooked and had little to no sauce at all on them.  Had to put my own franks on them to be edible.  Will not return."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza we ordered while i was at work and the pizza was so good perfect crust perfect sauce it was just amazing. We shared with a couple of people at work and our clients and they found it to be really good as well. And price was not bad definitely ordering again."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Parmesan footlong sub. It was dry wish I had got the pizza recent reviews rave about it. Staff and service is good. The chicken is frozen before the cook it. I will go back for the pizza. They also have a $4.00 lunch two slices of pizza and a can of soda. Pizza was awful should have went to metro for same price."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.  Those garlic knots are the bomb.  Very reasonably priced/--  real NY thin crust pizza. Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and some wings. They barely put any toppings so it was hard to taste anything but grease. We also ordered wings and when we opened it up, it looked like they had a hard time making the mild sauce stick to it. Just watery boiled wings with a pool of sauce stuck on the bottom of the box it was served in. I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"We had this delivered tonight for a party, various pizza and boneless hot wings. Spectacular. If you don't know New York pizza you may not appreciate it, it's not \"soggy\", but has that delicious glow of oil from the pepperoni. Delivery was spot on time too. We are fans!"}
{"text":"We found this pace on GrubHub and have never looked back.  We love ordering from Mom and Pop shops especially because the pizza is far superior to any chain restaurant.  Jesse's pizza has GREAT pizza and amazing meatball subs.  Their salads are fresh and the longest we've had to wait is an hour on a busy night.  Pizza is great...try it!"}
{"text":"Why does there always have to be a sad story to every new great pizza discovery - \"Jesse, you're on the wrong side of town.\"   I was over at a friend's house when he suggested we grab one of their pies for lunch. He ordered a pepperoni pizza, scheduled for pickup.  My friend must had ordered from there several times before. He either knew to ask for extra sauce or all of Jesse's pizzas come with extra sauce. I thought it had the perfect amount and I am quite sure it would not have been as good with less.  The crust was perfectly seasoned and cooked; the pepperoni was plentiful (although extra pepperoni might be worth a try next time); and the sauce was right tasty. In short, it was an excellent pizza and an even better value at around $8.  Hey Jesse - can you please (oh please) open a store in Summerlin? Until then, I will be making a lot of across town hunger trips (in college we used to drive 500 miles round-trip (after the bar closed of course) just to get a few slices at this great 24 hour pizza joint in Minneapolis)."}
{"text":"I will be honest, I was going to just get some Papa Johns to be safe, but after seeing the Yelps on Jesse's I had to give it a try. Damn glad I did.  I had their large supreme and loved the thin crust and high quality ingredients.  It will feed 3-4 hungry guys if you get some appetizers.  We got the chicken fingers done with medium sauce and loved them. Their garlic cheese bread is a hoagie bun sliced, so not large, but oh so delicious.  This place is the best. If you are in thier delivery area there is no other option, not sure about dining in."}
{"text":"Fast delivery - great people - and fantastic pizza and garlic knots. Was sad the knots only had four little ones - but they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"We used to order from Sunset Pizzeria on Boulder Highway every week, but once their new ownership/management came on board last year, the service is seriously lacking and the quality of the pizza has also sadly declined. We decided to give Jesse's a try and we have not been disappointed!  Great pizza, garlic knots, and fries and very reasonable prices.  We have not eaten in the restaurant so I can't speak to that experience, but I order online through Yelp and receive quick and friendly delivery every time.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. We would order again. I'm from Jersey and I haven't had a 5 star pizza in town yet. Friendly and punctual."}
{"text":"Jesse's Pizza is one of my top favorite pizza places. Food is always great and delivery is fast. If you haven't tried the garlic knots yet please do, they are so delicious!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So after a little sour incident with my pizza arriving in not such great shape, I got a call from Jesses almost immediately after posting a review and they immediately rectified the situation. Great food and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Love this place for take-out! Great thin-crust pizza, but their garlic knots are to-die-for! You can get a 16\" cheese pizza for $5.01 if you come pick it up. Add pepperoni for a little more, and you get a bigger, better pizza than the $5 take-out pizza at that other place. We added garlic knots, and had a yummy meal for a family of 4, for $12."}
{"text":"The pizza is bomb! The delivery was quick and the delivery guy was really nice. I will def. order this pizza all the time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza joint so far. The pizza and garlic knots are amazing & the staff is so nice. I live down the street, so I always pick up.. But my order is always ready in a timely manner. Love love love jesses pizza!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We order delivery. Flavor seemed like it would've been great if our pizza was cooked properly. Dough was tough and then soggy towards the center. When we picked up a slice all our toppings came right off. Wings were over cooked and didn't have much hot sauce. Ranch was good though"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Nice workers, small location....a little hard to find, especially at night and the store sign is not lit up.   Pizza was just ok...started out good, but after my first slice, there was nothing in its flavor or the dough that made me want to get more.  I guess once my hunger was gone, then I couldn't care less about this pizza.  Garlic knots were good, soft and buttery...yum. A good place to try at least once if you want to venture out of the \"norm\" to find good alternatives.... but in my case, I'm still searching.  Sorry, Jesse's, you all are not the one."}
{"text":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!! Horrible customer service. Food was inadequate and 2 handfuls of croutons was there idea of a Ceasar salad. They also argued when I asked for oil & vinegar in place of Ceasar dressing. Just a joke, not a true Italian Restaurant. I will be telling everyone I know NOT to go to Jessies. Manager called back and did NOTHING !"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but we were not fans. We got a veggie pizza and a cheese pizza and both were soggy and just kind of bland. The service wasn't great either. With all of the pizza places in Henderson I would definitely go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Jesse's for a couple years now. There are definitely pros and cons with this establishment. The first time I called to place a delivery, I asked the guy answering the phone if it's easier to order through them or online with grub hub, as that is an option provided on THEIR website and I almost felt like he berated me and told me to never use grubhub because that is a third party source and I can run the risk of not getting my food and to always call and place my order...ok?? So, I informed that whoever is running the show for them might want to look at their website then because grubhub is listed as an option to use when ordering. This brings me to the con of Jesse's pizza, I despise calling them to order my food. Whoever answers the phone acts like it is a bother to answer and has attitude, however, as the phone call is progressing the attitude is less noticeable and things chill out. I worked in the service industry for 10 years so I am a pretty forgiving person, but I know that if my husband ever called to place the order he would probably hang up on them within the first couple minutes it gets that aggravating at times to talk to them. One time I ordered some pizza and an antipasto salad (the best salad) and the delivery driver just brought the pizzas and when I asked the delivery driver where the salad was, he argued with me that I didn't order a salad. I informed that I did order a salad and showed him the receipt and he was very apologetic and stated they were short staffed and offered to come back with my salad and since I really wanted that salad I told him I would be waiting.  The pros is the food is good, delivery drivers usually pretty chill, and the Italian and ranch dressing is homemade and really good. The prices on everything are very reasonable except for the chicken fingers, I can't figure out why those are so high. I have tried quite a bit of different items on the menu and enjoyed it all. I saw a couple yelpers said pizza was soggy and nasty the next day and I can say I enjoyed my pizza for lunch leftovers and had no issues with taste changes. My older kids also order from Jesse's and they love it as well. I would definitely keep coming here and recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Ordered two different flavor wings. They were really delicious, and the delivery was fast. They have us a bunch of extra sauce and ranch. Pretty good, I'll eat them again."}
{"text":"This review is long over due, I order Jesse's pizza twice a week and it's literally the best pizza EVER!"}
{"text":"When I first started coming here a large cheese was six dollars now it's 8.50 and each additional topping its 2 dollars ?! The pizza is great don't get me wrong but this place isn't consistent... The garlic knots are fantastic as are the French fries but the mozzarella sticks are clearly frozen in a box from Walmart or the equivalent! Can't fault the food for the most part but more than a 33% increase on the cost of a pizza and then 2 dollars for each topping after that ? That's crazy... I'm not sure if I should give it 3 or 4 stars so I'll be kind for now because the pizza truly is phenomenal but some of the things I pointed out need to be addressed! Id recommend to a friend but not if i knew they were on a budget or like mozzarella sticks ! Lol"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery: Hawaiian pizza + garlic knots.  The delivery was on time or slightly early from the estimate.  It would be nice if they checked that the recipient is the actual one who placed the order instead of blindly trusting the entered information.  I like that they deliver all the way out to Touro Nevada campus -- allows me to avoid stinking my car up with pizza smell and having to give up studying time to drive.  Pizza was good.  Crust could have been a bit crispier but guess that's what happens with delivery so I didn't feel it merited a star loss.  The crust was salty but not overpoweringly so.  (It does get a lot saltier when the pizza is cold)    Garlic knots were chewy and flavorful.  Marinara sauce was tangy and helped to cut through the greasy goodness of the knots.  I thoroughly enjoyed them.  I do have one wish for the pizza box however... I wish they placed a wax paper and then placed a cardboard disk on top of the waxed paper (to absorb the liquid and protect the pizza).  My box was completely soaked through and made a mess on the table.  The moisture/grease content of the pizza would explain why the reviewers wrote that the crust is soggy the next day and why my box was soaked through.  I haven't tried tasting the pizza the next day so this review is based on consuming the pizza around the time of delivery."}
{"text":"We order from here twice a week. Yummy comfort food. Juicy and fresh, not greasy. Tastes like Home Cookin'"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PIZZA !!!!!! honestly everything about the food is really good. My Bf and I found this place on Yelp and its one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I came here a couple times had a bad experience I let some time go by so I thought I'd try it again just to pick up a couple sandwiches. They close at 9pm,  I walked in at 8:45. They told me they've cleaned everything up and they weren't taking orders unless I wanted a pizza. I don't know,.. I run a business and either I'm open or I'm closed...kinda first rule of a successful business, no?. Meanwhile those guys were kicking butt trying to get out of there at exactly 9 . I hope the owner reads this. Actually,  I sure hope that wasn't the owner! The bottom line, not only is the food often questionable, now they don't offer basic customer service. The third time was not a charm I am done for good until the new owners take over."}
{"text":"Jesses is good thin crust pizza. The ingredients always taste fresh and not greasy! I love this place!   Plus the people are nice, and they have a good house salad with (i think) home made ranch.  yum!"}
{"text":"The large pizza used to be $5.99 now they've gone to $8.49 and tried to get third party people like GrubHub to sell it now I hear they're closed Monday and Tuesday that's 30% of the week are they on the verge of going out of business?  You don't close up 2 days a week if you're doing well you simply hire more people"}
{"text":"Since moving to the Las Vegas area, I was desperately looking for a pizza place that reminded me of some of my favorites from L.A.; especially North Hollywood's Joe Peep's.  Going by online rankings, I tried Aurelios and Papreza, but I've just never been a fan of the Chicago-style deep dish which, to me, wrongly favors the crust over the toppings.  Metro Pizza got a little closer but the pizza wasn't as distinctive as the charm of the restaurant itself; basically Vegas' equivalent to Shakey's.  Then I found Jesse's and I felt like I was home.. Lots of cheese? Check. Great and thick sauce? Check. Great toppings? You bet. Mind you, I've still had better pizzas and lord knows I will never find another equivalent to Peeps (I even tried in New York), but Jesse's is the best in Vegas, hands down."}
{"text":"This was exactly what I was looking for.  A simple hand made pizza and basic wings. Great flavors! The garlic knots were amazing too. Super soft and delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and extremely reasonable prices! The staff is always excellent to deal with and always provide spot on time frames!"}
{"text":"I've been going to jesses since they were a small little side joint in the gas station on arroyo grande. I moved from this side of town and just happenned to be over here tonight and picked up two large pizzas supreme and pepperoni. The pizza was so greasy the cheese and all topping literally just fell off. I also ordered chicken fingers that were just laying in grease on the box. The grease over rided what is usually so delicious about jesses. I really hope this was just a bad night for pizza making and not a give up due to metro being in the same parking lot now."}
{"text":"Supreme pizza ?? How do you call it double cheese ??? There's half portion of cheese , just bunch of olives , the only good thing was fast delivery"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. A Hawaiian which was ok in my opinion and a pepperoni and mushroom, that one was really good. This surprised me because Hawaiian is typically my favorite. Also got an order of medium style hot wings which were really good and the ranch was also delicious. It is very reasonably priced also. For 2 large pizzas and an order of wings and a side salad...it was only 40 dollars. We were quite happy with how fast it arrived (it said an hour or more and it wasn't more than half an hour I don't think). I'll definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I love that they deliver to the Lake Las Vegas area with no problems and the delivery driver was very nice and funny. I will be using them again"}
{"text":"The $5.99 Large Cheese pizza deal is a steal.  That being said, this isn't the greatest pizza out there but for that price, it was pretty good.  The pizza was big and the sauce to cheese ratio was good.  I also got Caesar Salad that I threw away because the lettuce was wilted and gross.  I wasn't too upset about it because of the cheap pizza.  It is definitely worth a stop if you're looking for a cheap pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered the garlic knots, a pepperoni pizza, a combination with no olives (picture), and a cookie pie. The garlic knots were really really good and you get 12 for only $4.75!! The pizza was okay.. I didn't like the taste of the bread or the stringy super long pieces of onion. I ended up drowning it in ranch . The cookie pie was good! Not the best one I've had but pretty decent (it is hard to go wrong with cookies)."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. Pepperoni and cheese are the best. They deliver this to my school."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmm. Just had our first time eating here and it was delicious! We relocated to henderson from upstate NY and this pizza was easily equal to if not better than the pizza we had in NY! Garlic knots were cooked perfectly and to die for. Delivery was quicker than we were told too. Only thing I would change is the delivery driver wasn't friendly and hardly spoke to us. But, I can deal with that for good food!"}
{"text":"I know that others may disagree...but I was not impressed with the pizza at all.  A lot of the reviews are about the deal that they got...$5 for a pizza....and they would be correct.  That IS a great deal....but if you don't enjoy what you are eating....how good of a deal is it?  The crust was like cardboard (dry and tough) and there was not enough sauce on the pizza for our liking.   Personally, I would prefer to pay a little more for a great pizza....but that is just me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite take out pizza place in town. The Hawaiian is amazing. Prices are totally reasonable."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza and ham/ provolone sub.. the pizza was awesome..sub was okay"}
{"text":"Really wasn't my favorite. The pizza was really greasy and just not for me. I didn't even save the leftovers. The chicken was alright though."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.  This place isn't far from my house, so I'll probably go back.  Not as good as my beloved Grimaldi's, but it's plenty good for the price."}
{"text":"Yummy fast hot food and delivery  the jalapeño bacon ranch knots are super yummy. Good pizza, sub's , and wings. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings!  Super friendly and great delivery time!  Will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"I am pretty impressed.  I decided to order from Jessie's after reading multiple reviews for other places nearby. Jessie's had more recent positive reviews.   I have been binge studying for midterms and needed some greasy food. After all, advertisements these days are all about the greasy, yummy food with the superbowl looming.  Anyway, delivery was faster than anticipated (maybe 30 minutes instead of the estimated 45-60mins), the pizza was a little greasy but delicious and the mozz sticks were great, as well.  I will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The garlic knots were amazing. The pizza was good not great the crust easily falls apart and then your toppings. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place! I've never actually been to the place but I order delivery all the time. Their pizza is on point and their staff is very friendly as far as I can tell on the phone. I recommend this place if you're in the area, especially when you need some good grub for parties."}
{"text":"When on a Wednesday at 6:28pm your delivery time is and I quote \"OVER 2 HOURS\" you should no longer state you have such service. That's just ridiculous, called Rosatis right down the street and they said a respectable 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Crust was not crispy at all; Still very dough like Ordered 3 pizzas-- sausage and cheese was almost unbearably salty, sausage and pepperoni was extremely salty and we could not eat it. The two stars are for service-- Delivery was exactly an hour, EAT 24 app/ delivery man was very friendly and pizza was very hot."}
{"text":"This place is OK but I am a picky pizza snob! Garlic Knots - OMG hands down best I have ever had Ranch Dressing - nice light flavor, not overwhelming and def homemade. Pizza - was not impressed.  It looked like it had sat around for an hour then tossed back in the over to reheat. Flavor of sauce was good and crust was nice and crispy. Not saying I would not try this place again bc I will.  Service was great for a quick take out place.  Friendly staff and prices are pretty good."}
{"text":"When we first tried Jesses we were excited to find great value... it's so hard to find these days. But what happened,  Jesses? The prices went up and the quality went down, that's what. They have the ability to make a great pizza, but consistency is their problem. One day it's crunchy and delicious, the next it's saggy and paper thin. At 8.50 it's still a great value but now I find myself wanting to spend a bit more for pizza that I can always rely on. It also isn't as quick as it used to be. We sometimes have to wait over 30 minutes for one pie. This used to be the good, quick and cheap option. Now it's quickly losing its spot in our rotation."}
{"text":"Got a half cheese half pepperoni pizza from here. No complaints pizza was good. Service seemed good. Small place, seems probably most of business is take out and delivery. I don't think there were even any tables in there when I went..."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered much from their menu, but their chicken fingers and wings are delicious. I can't really speak for anything else, but I have ordered from here twice and I will continue to order from here again. I'm also a huge condiments person so what really sold me was their RANCH. Order a full size and you won't regret it. I have only ordered delivery so I'm not sure how the service is inside their restaurant, but the person who delivers is always quick and friendly. Only bit of disappointment is that their delivery charge is $5. I can live with that though."}
{"text":"I have been searching for that special pizza place in Henderson for a long time and I'm happy to say i found it! lol We decided to go all out and try all our favs! I can tell the wings are awesome! Super moist! Not dry like most! We ordered 3 pizzas, the cheese, the all meat pizza and the Jessie supreme! All get the thumbs up! The antipasto salad was perfect! I was quoted a 45 minute delivery window and it got here in 35! Friendly fast service! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If u like thin, soft and gummy pizza not at all cooked right but killer sauce and cheese GO HERE.  Plus side service is UNREAL....weird hours. Ordered a pizza once and they were closed and my friend had not made it there yet to pick up and they texted from personal device to make sure we were still on way and safe not in accident ... Gnarly GREAT cus service !!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and my ordered showed up later than it was supposed to and looked like the following picture. Won't be ordering from here again. Not worth the money and they obviously don't care."}
{"text":"I was starving after work and I found this place through Yelp! It didn't disappoint!  I ordered the small supreme pizza and hot chicken wings for around $20. Everything was delicious, all the toppings tasted fresh and I love the kind of cheese they use. Also, it took me about 3 days to finish the whole pizza, so the small is actually a pretty decent size.   Also, it's a little bit near a Fresh & Easy... so use that as a point of reference in case you get lost."}
{"text":"I'm a self-proclaimed pizza snob and Jesse's Supreme Pizza was excellent. Nice mix of pepperoni, spicy sausage and yummy vegetables. I only wish I'd ordered the large. The best thing by far though was the garlic knots. You get a dozen for less than $5. They are so delicious I ate at least three right away. Will be a regular customer for sure. Food was delivered quickly which was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Very reasonable priced New York style pizza. Thin crust so folding slices in half is a must! Wings were exactly what u would expect. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Pizza is damn good, chewy, fresh, greasy, and delicious--just how pizza is supposed to be. New Yorkers, jesses pizza has arrived."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! Called in at 9:00 on 5/5/18 and a guy answered says his name was jason had an attitude right upon answering the phone. Brushed it off I'm sure you guys are busy and because I'm starving and continued my order while this guys was sarcastic a rude the entire call and hung up on me when I wanted to switch my payment method to cash. I've heard the food is really good but busy or not you need to switch out whoever is answering your phone because I'm sure I'm not the only one"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered the Jessie's Supreme and it was on point. East coast style all the way. I'm picky about my pizza and this definitely compares to New York pizza. Thin crust, thin sauce, extra cheese, crisp but fluffy crust. Ranch was .com."}
{"text":"This is our second time ordering from here. Excellent pizza as well as the garlic knots! I would have given 5 stars but I thought the wings were a tad too soggy from our first experience."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza, great prices, amazing salad. The garlic knots are to die for, and everything is really cheap. I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Took a chance on ordering delivery from here, and I must say, I'm very glad I did. The prices are extremely fair as is the low delivery fee. I ordered a chicken parm sub, garlic knots, and zeppoli. The sub was delicious, and on very good toasted bread. The garlic knots are some of the best I've ever had, and the zeppoli is a pretty damn good dessert. Everything arrived hot at my door, and 10 minutes before the estimated arrival time. I'll be ordering from here again for sure, as well as checking the restaurant put in person."}
{"text":"My family is officially ADDICTED to Jesse's Pizza.  I think we've been every weekend for the last month.  The bacon jalapeno knots are amaze-balls!! Pizza is delicious. The dudes in back are friendly and great at their job. My order is always ready on time.  Quality is TOP NOTCH!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza I have ever had my life the delivery just dropped off this pizza it is so soggy you can't even pick it up it's disgusting don't ever order Jesse's pizza"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza, dinner salad, and garlic knots. Delivery came about 20 minutes sooner than the app estimated. Everything was really yummy!"}
{"text":"Good prices good food, great staff. Can't beat it, get the chicken ceaser salad or ham and cheese sandwich. Won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Pretty good NY style pizza.  My only complaint is that 3 out of 3 of our pizzas (mushroom, green pepper, and pepperoni & pineapple) were all very skimpy on the toppings. Could have at least doubled the toppings to get to the level of other places.  Other than that, good pizza, good prices."}
{"text":"From a Long Island guy who ate pizza almost everyday, this is my fav spot for Las Vegas!  Plain Pie and Garlic knots! Always good and always consistent!"}
