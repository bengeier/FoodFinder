{"text":"These trucks (moonlight and sunshine) are a fantastic choice for on campus dining, definitely worth the walk. They are the two trucks closest to the corner in the line of trucks permanently parked behind campus.   As always, I usually get the Pho. The quality of the soup seems to vary day by day. Sometimes it is fantastic, some days a little bland. Even at its worst it is better than the on campus dining options. The price is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food trucks are a wonderful lunch alternative on campuses and other heavily populated areas.  Quick and convenient and reasonable priced.  On a nice day sit on a park bench and enjoy. On other days, carry back to the office."}
{"text":"CMU food truck.  Rice is dry and old. Clumped together.   Chicken and vegetable  - has only vegetable   Should have gone with General Tso"}
{"text":"You've never had CMU food until you've had food from the Moonlight truck!!    Seriously, their food is so consistent that every time everything taste exactly the same.  You can order broccoli and beef, vegetarian chow mien or cashew chicken and they all taste the same.  It has 1 pot of oil for frying, one wok for stir frying and 1 soy base sauce and everything goes through all three.  When you get your lunch box, be sure to check your reflection and fix your hair from the grease on the food.  It is as good as artery clogging greasy Chop Suey can get."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of cheap food but I have to admit that the food here is underwhelming. Overall, greasy is an understatement."}
{"text":"I don't think there's a yelp review on the food trucks lining Margaret Morrison Street on the Carnegie Mellon campus. If they can yelp the halal trucks in nyc, I can do the same for truck food at CMU.  Pros: Cheap, but eaten daily, it adds up. An inexpensive way to achieve dietary staples:  meat, fresh veggies, carbs The lady that works there is eager to please. Wonderful assortment of condiments and asian pop music.  Cons: Find a hair in my food EVERY time. But in confined cooking spaces, what else can you expect. The food ache my stomach for about an hour after being eaten, but then my body gets over it and I feel like it was worth it."}
