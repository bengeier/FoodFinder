{"text":"Je suis marié à un cuisinier Taïwanais et ce n'est vraiment pas représentatif d'une bonne cuisine Taïwanaise. Les ribs porc à l'orange n'avait pas de viande, seulement des os et du cartilage et il baignait dans une sauce sucré insipide. Le poulet popcorn était correct mais il est tellement meilleur dans les street food de Taiwan. Le three cup étais sans goût et de mauvaise qualité. ils ne goûtait même pas l'huile de sésame. Bref! à éviter car même qualité que le buffet chinois de chinatown"}
{"text":"This place has some interesting dishes that I have not seen before. I've tried two appetizers so far here. Although I will never like stinky tofu ($6.50), I thought this one was really well-cooked and prepared, the stinkiness is not strong as another reviewer said but you can definitely smell and taste it. The tofu is covered with a bit of sweet garlic sauce and has a side of pickled cabbage which you can eat in turn with the tofu to offset some of the stinkiness. I also tried their popcorn chicken which comes with fried basil. It was good and tasted like other ones I had but the basil was a nice touch.

I've been a bit underwhelmed by the mains I've tried so far. The celery and squid stir-fry ($15) was fine, a bit too subtle in flavor at least for me. Similarly I also tried a hakka stir fry which again only had celery as the vegetable and was similarly subtle without a distinct flavor. I also don't like having to pay $2 for a modest bowl of rice.

Portion to price ratio is decent and not as good as some Chinatown places but part of that is probably because they accept credit card. There are a good number of tables here but you have to walk up a pretty tall and steep flight of stairs to get here. I plan to go back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent, polite and fast service. Staff is extremely friendly. Food is ok, not extraordinary"}
{"text":"Great Asian restaurant! Located right outside Chinatown, it is easily missed if you are not looking for it. This is a Taiwanese restaurant serving what should be more authentic food from Taiwan. I went there for dinner with a bunch of friends on a cold January evening. As expected, the place was the opposite of crowded, with only a few tables filled. 

As for the food itself, it is very tasty. I ordered a bowl of rice with pork (6.75$). The portion was fair for the price and the taste itself was good at best. Since it was only rice and meat, the array of flavors was a little missing. But what they really did well was their fried popcorn chicken. It was fried just enough to leave the outside crispy and keep the tenderness of the chicken. The fried spinach leaves were a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"Super happy there is a new Taiwanese resto in town. Overall good experience. I think the place will be even better with Minor improvement. I will go back for sure. The waitress was very friendly! 

Here is brief review on the 3 dishes I had:

- The flavour of the salty popcorn chicken was great and on point. However the chicken itself tasted a bit...old. Maybe the quality wasn't the best on the day I visited.  But they nail the tasty part for sure. I would go back and give it a try again. 

- The satay Beef was a surprise hit for me! My favourite dish during my visit!  taste was on point and you can tell the quality of the beef was good by the texture. 

- Taiwanese style fried rice with sausage.  Just ok I think. Happy I tried, but it's not like it's so good you have to try again.  

I would love to go back and try other dishes. This place has potential. :)"}
{"text":"Cool concept - as someone who has spent a bit of time in Taiwan and Taipei, having the chance to try out some of the street food again was really up my alley. Service was good, they also had some weird promotion where you pick a discount ball at the end to get 10% or 20% off. Tried out the \"yellow wine chicken\", the 3 cup calamari, a beef dish (I didn't catch the name in English) and stinky tofu.

The stinky tofu was good and not too crazy for western palettes. Three cup calamari was good, nice and hot and the sauce had a lot of flavour. I couldn't help thinking the dish would have just been better as 3 cup chicken though... I had wanted to try the popcorn chicken as fried chicken was one of my favourite street foods in Taiwan but they were out.

All in all, it was a good place to grab a bite and I like the concept of having small plates of street food. Would go back again, but would hope the chicken was available."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be Nukee, a Chinese restaurant. Now it is a Taiwanese restaurant featuring most street foods in Taiwain. The service was good. The deco was simple.
We had minced pork rice bowl, chicken popcorn, three cup chicken, the gua bao and oyster pancake.
I found the two chicken dishes too salty. The oyster pancake was a disaster. It was a plate of wet texture sticking to the plate, not solid, not like a pancake at all. I can only picked up the oyster and egg but nothing else. I asked about why, and the lady told me it is normally like this. However, I have been to Taiwan and had ate that dish before. That was not true. This dish charges 13$, which doesn't include much fancy ingredient. The chef should respect his work and refrain from serving food like this. 
The rice bowl was enjoyed very much. If I'd come back next time, I would order the rice bowl and popcorn chicken. Also the gua bao ???? was very good too."}
{"text":"First time experience Taiwanese street food in Montreal and it was great. I ordered chicken popcorn which it crispy and well cooked chicken with their basil leave, stinky tofu, pork feet, three cup chicken. Everything's good!!! Can't wait to go backkkkk"}
{"text":"My very first review in 2018!
Went there with the wife and my buddy to have an early dinner. My wife saw their ad on the chinese social media so we decided to give it a try.

To start, I find the location is a bit unfortunate, difficult to find and it's not in a crowded area, it's in a rural area next to the big hydro Québec building. I wouldn't even consider chinatown even it's on the edge of it.

The decor is simple, feels like family owns business.

Enough about the location, let's talk about the food.
Why I gave 5 stars? Because it's totally worth it.

A very authentic Taiwanese taste!
We ordered the following:

- Taiwanese style salted popcorn chicken
Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Smell, look and taste good!

- Stinky tofus
Yep you read that right lol stinky it is haha
Stinky tofus is a weird one... The stinkier they are the better... However their aren't stinky enough so it isn't enough \"flavour\" in my opinion. Weird. I know lol

- Oysters pancake
Oysters pancake isn't my favorite dish, but the one they have is not bad.

- Lamb meat soup pot
In this freezing season, lamp pot is always good to have. The lamp meat is so soft, it melt as soon as I out into my mouth

- 3 cups chicken
It's called 3 cups chicken but no, they don't serve chickens in 3 different cups Lollll.
This one is tasty, it goes very well with a bowl of steam rice.

- Garlic beef dice
Another one that can go with steam rice, a bowl or 2 lol. But it smell sooooooooo good, you just can't stop eating it.

I gotta say, I wasn't expecting much from this place, but after one surprise followed another surprise, I must say that meal was very satisfying :) 

I will go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice in under 24 hours: great food and decent service. The popcorn chicken tastes exactly as I recalled it was on the streets of Taichung.

The braised pork on rice was tasty, oily, and inexpensive, but the portion size is quite small, so it's best to order an appetizer. I recommend the popcorn chicken heh. And no taro fries (very dry).

The oyster pancake is also very good, I don't think I've had that anywhere else in Montreal. The oyster pancake is made with oysters and potato starch, which makes it gelatinous rather than fluffy/pancakey.

The stinky tofu is rather mild, so if you've never had it in your life, you can check it out.  It's fried and doesn't smell at all. It's still stinky though, once you try it. 

Hmm the downside of this place is that it easily gets loud. The walls reflects all the sound waves back into the room instead of absorbing them.

Oh and they should probably add bubble tea as well heh."}
{"text":"The owner is Taiwanese who also owns Nudo in Chinatown. I ordered 3 dishes today and they are all pretty decent, it was pork stew on rice, popcorn chicken, and beef fried rice. Pork stew on rice is not to big of a portion but the price described it's size, it is quite authentic and goes well with popcorn chicken. I like the fact that they includes fried basil with the popcorn chicken, which is what they did back home. The fried rice is decent, I had some very similar ones back in Vancouver, but I did not order that when I were in Taiwan so I couldn't really tell how authentic it is. At least it is also decent. Our server is friendly and always notice us when I need something from her. She doesn't mind the fact that I ask for water multiple time. 
Well I'm glad they started this place so I have one more option to choose from. 
((Try their popcorn chicken"}
