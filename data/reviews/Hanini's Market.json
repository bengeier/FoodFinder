{"text":"You won't find a better deal on a gyro than here. Their gyros are better than any Greek restaurant in Pittsburgh and not only are they better they are way bigger, and also way cheaper. Great place to grab lunch. This spot holds it down."}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  This is a Cleveland based company so you know they must have great corned beef.  I got a corned beef sandwich and it was fantastic.  The sandwich was huge and the meat was fresh.  Apparently their gyros are amazing too, but I didn't try one.  Also yelp has them listed as extremely expensive currently, but that is a lie as all of the menu items were under 10 dollars and most of the sandwiches are 6 or 7 bucks.  Hanini's is in a run down neighborhood so if you are a snob you may want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The graffiti on the side of this convenience store in Wilkinsburg PA is what first grabbed my attention when driving by. I looked up the business then and read the couple reviews. From those, I added Hanini's to my list of places to try. Finally one day, my husband and I grabbed a couple sandwiches for lunch. There is no place for eating in - take-out only. We ordered a pastrami and a corned beef sub. Years ago, I was hooked on the corned beef sandwiches with a side of potato salad from a small shop on Main Street in Butler. I have seldom had a comparable corned beef since then. This may be it though. I watched as they cut the meat to order for each sandwich. There is something great about the taste of freshly sliced meats. I added the coleslaw to the corned beef that first visit which made it too messy. Other than that, everything else was great with these sandwiches. The sandwiches were piled high with meat and made with our specified condiments as in any chain sandwich shop, but this is not your regular chain sandwich shop. This place is cuts above the rest, so give it a try. You can call ahead, so your sandwich is ready for pick-up when you arrive. I only wish they would add my potato salad to make my meal complete, but I am particular about my potato salads.."}
{"text":"A Bodega with great take out sandwiches.  For those who don't know Hanini's Market is a Cleveland based market. I had seen them throughout Cleveland during our many trips there, but never tried them. I was happy to see a location pop up in Wilkinsburg and had to check them out.   Hanini's is a corner store that has just about every snack you could ever want like candy, chips, pop and a few grocery staples like milk, bread and eggs. You can also buy t shirts, hats and other clothing, play the lottery and get \"smoking supplies\" as well, but the REAL reason to come here is for the sandwiches! It's more convenience store than restaurant so to go is the only option.  The sandwich counter set up is very similar to Subway's in which you tell them which sandwich you and what bread you want it on and if you want it heated or not and them what veges you want. What i like about Hanini's is that their meats and vegetables are of much better quality than what I have typically find at Subway.  What really sets Hanini's over the top is the fact that they offer so many different types of sandwiches like paninis, reubens, gyros, wraps, burgers, hot dogs, quesadillas and Polish Boys just to name a few. They also offer different salads and loaded tater tots.  My families go to sandwich is always a cold corned beef sub on white bread. They are HUGE and come packed with a couple big handfuls of meat. We all get our own sandwiches as we are not about to share with each other. The sandwich is definitely big enough to have half for lunch the next day. The corned beef is very tender and melts in your mouth.   Cleveland is known for great corned beef sandwiches with places like Slyman's so I'm thankful to get a taste of Cleveland here in Pittsburgh thanks to Hanini's Market."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered two subs via Uber Eats from Haninis for dinner while we watched the Penguins game. We had both been  craving a sub, and had never heard of this place before.  First off, our food was done FAST. Especially considering it was a Friday at 8:30 during a Penguins play off game.  When we got the food we opened it up and dug in. My husband had a turkey, turkey ham, and corned beef. I had the hood club. Both were some of the best subs either of us have ever had. The meat to vegetable to bread ratio was absolutely spot on. I think we all have gotten a sub with WAY too much bread or lettuce. Not only that, but each sub was large (around 8 inches long) and only $8 each  Was it fancy? No. Was it absolutely delicious? Hell yes."}
{"text":"Corner store with a deli. Reminds me of New York City. The to go menu has variety and the price was reasonable. Had a corned beef sandwich with chips. The young man was friendly but I ordered french fries but he didn't hear me. The mean was lean but some edges were a bit dry. I would go back. Seems like a good local one stop shopping corner store. The parking lot can fill up but people are in and out so it doesn't stay crowded long."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood market with friendly people. Their sandwiches are HUGE and freshly made right in front of you."}
{"text":"This reminded me of Katz in NYC a little bit taste wise ! I ordered through Grubhub to my work. It came super fast. The fries are amazing, it's super cheap and the hot pastrami sub is to die for !"}
{"text":"This is a classic hood store with beastly sandwiches. you can get food, snacks, dvds and \"smoking accessories\".  The HUGE corned beef sandwich is a reason to come here. Freshly made in front of you I'm pretty sure that the large has over a pound of meat. The other sandwiches are just as good as are the burgers and wings. They also have huge salads.This is great for late night stop on your way through Wilkinsburg but beware the sandwich is pretty unmatched and will bring you back."}
