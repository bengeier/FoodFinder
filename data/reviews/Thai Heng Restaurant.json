{"text":"Decent food for the price. Pick up service is fast, dining room is nothing fancy but service is friendly & portions are large. Food isn't too greasy or salty."}
{"text":"Well, I am not sure they serve thai food.  But they have a really good Chinese / Vietnamese menu, and we've never been deceived when we ate here with my family.  I love their tom yum soup : Canh chua (viet). Their fried rice is OK ! The fried fish was really good with the fish sauce. Broccoli and beef OK ! Chicken wings, probably made with fish sauce, miam !!!!   We are usually a big table, so we share one of their combos. And they're pretty good combos !!!  It's a bring your own wine. Good for families and big groups (We were always more than 6 people when we are here)  The people who work there speaks Vietnamese !!"}
{"text":"Le Resto est simple, sans décor au goût du jour mais j'ai goûter au Meilleur homard au gingembre! Le tout, couper en morceau, pour simplifier la vie! Délicieux!"}
{"text":"I cook at home a lot and rarely entertain guests with takeout but, having previously ordered some great dishes from Thai Heng, thought I'd give it a shot for an impromptu family get together.   They didn't disappoint this time. Far from it actually.  The food was spectacular and ready in 25 minutes.   Seeing as I live so close to the location, we decided to do the take out thing. Their salt and pepper fried tofu is excellent, and to keep it from going soggy in transit, they make holes in the lid of the container. Extra points for that.   The braised beef noodles were unbelievable. I would say they stole the show. Not all of my dining companions showed the same enthusiasm, but if you've had this style of dish before, this one's worth a try.   Their Thai style chicken fried rice was another big success. Amazingly fluffy rice with a delicious hit of fresh Thai basil spiked with occasional fiery rings of birds eye chilies. They even throw in some sliced cucumber to help you cool down if you get a really spicy bite.   We got the chicken with ginger and scallions which was another crowd favourite.   I would give this place a definite must try if you're in the area and looking for quality Asian food. I can't say Chinese really as its a bit of a mixed bag there, but if you're looking for something that's a bit more authentic and not trying too hard to pander to the North American palette, this place fits the bill nicely."}
