{"text":"Good wine list. Everything else is way overpriced. $11 for just a slice of cheese. There's better options in the area. Yes it looks fun but only If you're the young money type."}
{"text":"I like Jonathan Poon's other restaurants a lot - it was exciting to hear that he was opening up another spot in Little Portugal/Dufferin Grove.   The space was bright, airy, and clean - it's a really great looking restaurant. I went for lunch (apparently, the dinner menu is pretty different) and had:  - Bread and butter - Poached salmon with green goddess dressing, potatoes, and olives - Chicken liver mousse on grilled bread, with mushrooms and honey - Prosciutto Cotto  - Couple drinks each  The bread was perfectly made and the butter was delicious. Poached salmon was nicely cooked, really liked the dressing. The chicken liver mousse was excellent as well. The price was pretty reasonable too, I believe it was about $10 to $20 for the larger dishes.   The Prosciutto Cotto was the only miss for me, I didn't think it tasted good. I really like Prosciutto in general, but I feel like this dish didn't have the ingredients work well together.   The wines were really great based on the suggestions from the staff.  Also, shout-out to the waitress that was on our table for the meal. She was professional, well-informed, and friendly.  Overall, I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The space is beautiful(5 stars). The food is excellent(4 stars). The service is the WORST (1 star- if that lol) Our table got up a few times to find our server- whoever it was. I felt like we should have tipped ourselves- if they can work on the service- this place will last longer than a year."}
{"text":"Oui oui, j'adore Paris Paris!   After three hours of walking, beaching, parking and partying with a toddler, that tiny terrorist finally fell asleep. It is a mandate in my marriage to go out while she sleeps on Sunday. We find a place big enough to park a stroller next to our table, but adult enough we can pretend she's not there. It's a fine balance, that we're slowly realizing Toronto understands well.   Enter Paris Paris, the perfect place for just this adventure.   Beyond our very specific needs, it's also the a stellar space to weekend lunch, have a glass of wine or a date night. I had an Aperol spritz and the soft shell crab sandwich. The sandwich was insane! So well balanced, so much crab and some flirty little pickles to make it perfect. Admittedly, it was a lot for me and we didn't need the salad or fries we ordered with it. My husband had the burger, and I was kind of jealous. A lot of deliciousness happening here.   The menu isn't actually French at all, but the vibes in Paris Paris are very, well, Paris Paris."}
