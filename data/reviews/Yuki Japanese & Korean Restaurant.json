{"text":"My friends and I had dinner here yesterday because it was the closest sushi restaurant by Yorkdale that wasn't AYCE . I've been here before for  lunch and its usually super packed during lunch hours.   

The service was good, our server was helpful but a bit pushy for us to order, I guess it was because we got there fairy late and stayed until closing.

As for the food, their sushi portions were HUGE, we ordered the green dragon roll and the spicy volcano roll. We also ordered some apps but ended up taking the sushi to-go. The quality for the food was worth the price. 

I would recommend this place for anyone in the area that is looking for decent sushi that isn't AYCE."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place. The food comes out nicely on the plate and the taste is just as delicous. In particular, chirashi don is my favorite, their sashimi is always fresh and tasty. I'll surely visit again"}
{"text":"Always love this place...Sashimi always fresh...rolls are amazingly good compare to all other places and decent price...highly recommended if you are sashimi lover..."}
{"text":"Favourite sushi resto of all time. Fresh fish, amazing avocado salad and the best shrimp crunch roll."}
{"text":"Very large portions, friendly staff.  Not the best sushi I've had but it's my go to when I'm craving and don't want to go downtown."}
{"text":"I've been a client of Yuki Sushi on Dufferin and Orfus for 15+ years. Ever since new management took over, the portion size is considerably smaller, the sushi not as fresh and the service leaves a lot to be desired. To give you an example, I placed an order for take out today for a Sushi Maki tray, Chicken Udon and Chicken Teriaki dinner. I needed clarification as to the number of Miso soups and salads included with the meals as i needed six in total. I enquired about the chicken tempura dinner as well and I was told next time to know what I intended to order ahead of time because he had others calling in.  I food that to be very rude. When I got home, the chicken was rubbery, the sushi not fresh, only 3 chopsticks when I clearly informed him we were six people, only one small container of soya sauce.  This never would have occurred with the past management. Needless to say, they will be losing 6 regular clients."}
{"text":"Decent Japa-Korean resto with a pretty extensive menu. We had the Niku Don and the Salmon Crunch which was absolutely massive. The Niku was ok and the roll above average. Went pretty late and the place was surprisingly busy. Seems they were somewhat understaffed at the time as well but the service was decent. Will definitely look to come back and try their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Defitnely one if the best sushi places I been. Try the dragon roll or the salmon teriyaki."}
{"text":"This is good place for sashimi and Udon noodle in soup.  The place is a bit small, if only me and my husband go, we dont have to wait but with my 3 kids, always wait for 10-15min."}
{"text":"Service was great with lots of food choices. Five of us had four lunch menus and two sets of rolls. Let's say the portions were large enough that we couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"I've been coming here often for their \"Hwae dup bap\", which is raw fish over warm rice and salad with sesame oil and spicy sauce. Tasty dish and friendly service. Free parking."}
{"text":"Yuki-more like yucky.  Sorry-that's childish of me.  I had to. 

My dad had been there a few times on his own and highly reccommended it to me and hubs so we went.  We had a combo there that combined a sushi boat, tempura and a korean rice dish.  All very decent-sushi/sashimi probably better than Seoul House across the street.

So we finish our side dishes and when we asked to have them refilled, the waitress told us that the refill on kimchi would cost extra.  I kindly told her that refills should be complementary.  She said \"No-you have to pay\".  So I told her that when my dad goes there and speaks fluent Korean he never gets charged.  She gave me the dirtiest face I have ever seen in my life (seriously!) made an experasperated grunt and left. 

Another waitress came to refill ALL our side dishes and the other waitress was sent to other tables.  

So after this situation, the food didn't seem to taste as good as I remembered 20 minutes ago.  Never been back.  Never will be back."}
{"text":"Not a neighborhood I usually frequent, but a dress-hunting bridal party of which I was a part of needed a quick bite in the Orfus Rd vicinity, and Yuki came up \"closest to us\" on Yelp. Great.

In a strip mall, directly across from the Dufferin exit of Orfus, Yuki definitely doesn't look special from the outside, but the inside has little private booths, adequate seating, hot tea and friendly servers. 

Wide variety of Bentos and Lunch specials in the $7-12 range. Everything that i would order was about $1 more than downtown, but it wasn't too bad. I selected a mediocre spicy tuna Maki and a pretty decent Udon Soup. My dining companions all ordered more interesting rolls which were massive and well presented and everyone ate every last bite. The avocado salad that I sampled was perfectly fresh and very tasty.  Korean food looked good too, although the selections were more limited and there was no Korean on the specials menu. 

Service was very good, all of our dishes were removed the moment we finished, and our tea was always full. Lunch Specials are in effect on weekends as well. 

Merchant Machine was down when we went, but I think that was a temporary thing. 

Full extra star for the service, and being a decent option for lunch in a neighborhood where you would not expect it."}
{"text":"Decided to go here because they have the lunch special till 4pm everyday. When we entered the restaurant it seemed to be very authentic but after we sat down we realized that they were playing like top 40 music and rap. We asked the waiter about the music and he said it was the sushi makers mix, killed the mood. On to the food, it was good. The sashimi was very tasteful and the tempura was decent. For the price not bad but if your a big eater then the portions aren't that big."}
{"text":"Well well finally made it to Yuki Sushi. I've driven by this place many times and wondered...
Well it was good, its not all you can eat and kinda on the pricier side but nice for dinner for 2 
The restaurant was clean and the service was great."}
{"text":"Dishonest and rude!!! The waiter lied to us about there being a booth available and made us wait 15 minutes!!! The place was busy and we (3ppl) asked if they had any booths but we were willing to take anything. There was one seat near the door for 4 and no booths. We said okay sure. Then a group of 3 behind us came in and she said oh there's a booth now, you're just gonna have to wait a couple of minutes til we clean up, we said sure. And she proceeded to give our table to the people who came in after us. Then we waited but 10 minutes later I got suspicious and walked by to see what room was available... turns out there was people in all of them!!!! I guess she had given a check and made the assumption they would leave right after! Then I talked to the waiter and said \"hey, where is our booth? They all are full? Why did you lie to us?\" And she said \"ok excuse me\" and proceeded to serve a customer. After that I was livid so I took my friends to Zuki instead. It was going to be there first time at Yuki. So they lost them as a customer and me. No apology or anything, just \"excuse me\". I used to come here quite frequently but not anymore."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick meal before heading to Yorkdale Mall. Was quite impressed with the service, fresh ingredients and cozy atmosphere. We ordered a variety of their dishes-sashimi, rolls, kalbi/tempura/chicken bentos. The rolls and fish was very fresh. Tempura was crispy and had just the right amount of batter. I wasn't as impressed with the cooked food- kalbi was quite oily and chicken was just okay. 

Would come here again if I'm in the area- good variety and reasonable prices. But generally, I think there's better Japanese/Korean options in Toronto."}
{"text":"I use to go to this place all the time. They refused to serve me at 10:31 because the last order was 10:30. Not impressed with their service. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Don't even bother"}
{"text":"It wasn't quite fair for me to write my first short review of Yu Ki after only one visit. It was also unfair of me to have written it based solely on a bento box.

That said, I went for a second visit on the weekend and ordered an assortment of rolls and appetizers. It was all very, very good.

Everyone in my party was very impressed by the quality, size and presentation of the food, especially the sushi. (I might also add that it was the perfect temperature... I can't stand sushi that tastes like it was prepared, straight out of the refrigerator.)

Considering it was a weekend, we were the only ones there for lunch in the somewhat non-residential neighbourhood. I work close by but generally avoid Yu Ki at lunch during the week due to the crowds.

But at least I can now fairly say that I know why it gets a crowd. Yu Ki is great!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place wasn't too bad, service was fast, friendly and consistent. Server came to check up on us throughout the stay to ensure everything was going well so I liked that. Food came out in a decent timeframe and was alright.

We ordered the unagi don, and sashimi bento. Although it was lunch, it didn't come with any dessert - fine with us.

They have some booths with privacy (hanging sheet cloths), high walls around the parameters of the booths, it feels quite small and cozy because of its limited space, but you definitely have ample room on the tables for larger orders. I didn't come across any fruit flies here, but the vicinity itself seems a little outdated and could possibly use a makeover.

Parking is available in its private lot, and the stop lights nearby can be helpful in exiting and entering the space, so there's that. I don't think you need reservations at this place, but definitely come when lunch is almost over (until 4pm usually on weekdays) to avoid longer wait times or unavailability."}
{"text":"Good good to be frank with the audience.. But our experience turned bad when no one was taking care about the table.. Empty glasses of water, no customer service and even wrong the bill with food never ordered or eat! No excuses or any effort to apologize."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Yuki Restaurant, and we were expecting good food and decent service, which is what we'd experienced before.

Instead, what we got was fish that actually smelled fishy, and looked visibly stale, like it had been sitting out. We ordered a plate of mixed sushi and maki rolls, and another plate of mixed sashimi. It seemed as though some fresh fish had been mixed with stale fish, maybe to try to get rid of the old one. There were cuts of salmon that were perfectly fresh, and cuts of salmon that looked crusted almost from sitting out - these bad pieces had a definite fishy odour to them. We were also unable to eat the tuna and two other kinds of fish (I'm not sure what the names are), as they were also fishy and not at all fresh. My mother ate a shrimp that was obviously bad. It smelled terrible!

All in all, we ate less than half of our meal - only the cuts of fish that actually looked like normal, fresh fish. We mentioned it to the waitress when she asked how everything was and she immediately told us that they only serve fresh fish, and that their food could not possibly be bad. She didn't smell the fish, and frankly, she barely glanced at it when we tried to point out that it looked terrible. We were not rude at all and didn't request that our meal is free, but again, told her that we had been there before and never had a problem with the food before.

The waitress went to speak to the chef on staff, and came back to tell us that the chef said their fish is very fresh!

We were very, very disappointed. No one other than the waitress came to speak to us, and all the waitress kept saying is that their fish is always fresh. My mother and I are both sushi lovers, and have been to many sushi restaurants around the city. We are not expecting stellar service every time, but we don't appreciate being lied to and wasting our money on food we cannot even eat.

Be very careful with this restaurant. We left wondering if we made a mistake trying to even eat part of our meal, in case it was all bad fish. 

We won't be visiting Yuki restaurant again."}
{"text":"Delicious green dragon rolls and fast service! They were very friendly as well. I enjoyed my visit here and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and good service. However a little pricy for what you're getting. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood sushi spot.  It always has consistent fresh fish and is a great deal with salads and Korean pancakes that are on the house."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a Chicken & Tempura bento box for lunch 12.99.   Good soup & hot green tea!   Home made tempura sauce was delicious.  3 shrimp tempura in the combo.   Their lunch specials are til 4PM."}
{"text":"Like the ambience even is a small place is cozy. Food is fresh and portions are a good value for price. Service was acceptable. Be careful going to restrooms since has steep stairs on the basement."}
{"text":"Yuki is one of the few affordable restaurants in the area, which is why it was crowded during lunch (lunch specials till 4).

I spent a while trying to pick up one of the inviting combos (if you can't make up your mind just use a coin). After trying to pick in between 3 options of sushi combo, I ended up ordering Korean...

They have house wine ($5), Asaki beer, and some decent bottles of wine.

I ordered the Korean version of sashimi (can't recall the name). It was accompanied by a miso soup  and a steamed rice. The fish came in a tower shape, with flying fish eggs, over a delicious salad. The salad was fixed with really thin stripes of the herbs, it was deliciously fresh and crunchy. This dish is an ideal option if you are watching your figure, or if you want something fresh and balanced. The only thing to watch out for are the fresh garlic flakes; I love garlic, I wasn't planning on kissing anyone, so I ate them all (they do taste strong tho).

Hahahaha!!! Someone posted a pic of a hair in the fish!!! Yes, that wouldn't be appealing, of course it can happen even in the fanciest place, and I just wouldn't go back if they wouldn't offer to exchange the dish."}
{"text":"Yuki is located in a strip mall on the corner of Dufferin St. and Sparrow Ave. There is a small parking lot in front and I was able to find a spot for early weekday dinner. The restaurant is small, but there is plenty of seating. The service was quick and efficient. They brought out complimentary hot tea with my meal, which is always nice.

Soft Shell Crab Appetizer $11 - Lightly battered, crispy, great taste (no fishy after taste).

Black Tiger Roll $10 - Came with complimentary miso soup, which tasted very good. The roll was big and delicious. The eel went well with the avocado that added a nice creamy texture.

Small hot sake $5

{"text":"Nice quite place... food always consistent. You can't go wrong. Bento box alway fresh... our go to place when we can't decide."}
{"text":"Yuki has great lunch specials at great prices until 4pm! My boyfriend and I popped in here for the first time after spending some time at Yorkdale Mall and at the stores on Orfus Road, all of which are very nearby. We arrived just before 4pm (just in time to take advantage of their lunch specials). We were seated in one of their private booths, which was closed off with curtains. Their private booths are great for romantic meals and/or quiet conversations. After being seated and reviewing their extensive lunch specials menu, my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Terriyaki Bento Box for only $6.99 and I ordered the Futomaki Sushi Bento Box for only $7.99. For what we paid, we were very pleasantly surprised with the generous portions and taste!!! My Futomaki pieces were HUGE, the sushi rice was perfectly cooked, our combos came with a generous amount of miso soup, we loved the small sides (lettuce salad, seaweed salad, bean sprout salad, and japchae), and my boyfriend had a lot of chicken in his bento box. This will definitely be our go-to lunch spot whenever we're in the area!"}
{"text":"When you go to this place seems that the house Speciality is Hair in your food, also the manager says!!

\"That can Happen\" 
Not even an apology just \"That can Happen\" next time they might say, ohh this is a Special hairy fish from mars exclusive for our hygienic Restaurant !!  Nice !!"}
{"text":"Yuki Restaurant is located in an old strip plaza on the very busy Dufferin St. It's one of those restaurants you'll probably pass by millions of times and never actually notice until someone points it out to you, and then you'll have found one of your top choices for a decent lunch in the area. It sure beats going to a chain. 

I've been here on business lunches, and it's a very cute little restaurant with great service. I've been very pleased to see the seating arrangement, since even though it's a very tight operation, you won't feel like you're listening in on someone else's conversation, unless you want to, of course. 

I usually just order the bento box, which comes with pretty decent sushi and tempura, while they do have many different options, such as Teriyaki. 

I always get great service, however, and that's what keeps me coming back for more (if and when I'm in the area)."}
{"text":"Yuki is a favourite spot for us at work, not only due to its proximity to our office, but because they have the BEST selection of bento boxes. 

Their menu is huge, with plenty of options, no matter what you're craving. I love how they combine Korean dishes in with the sushi. The food is always good, and the sashimi especially is very well presented. 

Prices are good for the amount of food you get and the quality is better than most places in the area."}
{"text":"You might said I'm picky but I don't think I would come back to this place.
Overall everything is just ok. I came here on lunch time and got lunch special. I think they have good price for sushi/korean food. 

I ordered sushi&sashimi bento while my friend ordered chicken teriyaki set. 
He was so upset about his choice because it wasn't good that he expected. The teriyaki sauce is too sweet and chicken has lot of burn, \"taste like dirty shoe\"-according to him.
 The sushi and sashimi is better. The sashimi is alright,but for the white tuna, i don't know why they make it as tataki, it's burn little bit and taste weird at the burn part. The rice is too dry and doesn't have much flavour.
However, service is good. Staffs here are friendly and helpful. 
In conclusion, Yuki is good for having little bit sushi taste with cheap price.
Hope you have better experience than me."}
{"text":"Great little place for Korean and sushi if you're in the neighbourhood. And it seems like it's relatively undiscovered, at least at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Well I was craving sushi and this was the only place around. 

They have private Japanese booths which was nice. 

I have been here before but did not realize that the last time I came I was able to get the lunch special. 

Unfortunately this time it was around 4pm and so it was no longer available. 

As another yelper stated, this is over priced for what you get and for being on the outskirts of downtown. 

Our waiter was attentive and friendly but I would reconsider coming back at any other time other than lunch hours seeing as that is the best deal for your money. 

On this day we ordered one of there boats for two people. It wasn't very diverse but we ordered it anyways. Not many options for boats for two. 

Personally way too much sushi rolls. They should offer a diversified option for a couple. Or better yet a dinner bento box. 

Atmosphere was ok, location has parking right in front but a bit pricey for what it is. 
And so, if I come back it will only be during lunch hrs."}
{"text":"I tried this place out for lunch. If you're coming for lunch, come early as it gets packed quickly.

Pros: Has lunch specials and dinner specials, food came out quickly, tempura and japchae was yummy

Cons: miso soup was too salty, the waitress sat me in a booth and didn't check up on me once the food came, didn't get a water refill, no banchan or kimchi, skimped on the Kalbi for the lunch special 

If you're looking for a place in the area that serves Korean food for the same price, your best bet would be the Seoul house on Orfus Rd."}
{"text":"I've been here 40+ times and every time the staff is very pleasant and accommodating.  I have a shellfish allergy and they're always very careful with the food, which is important. The sushi is great and the price is pretty reasonable. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Where do you go to eat when you're shopping at the outlet stores at Orfus? That was the question I was facing the other day. My criteria was that it has to be something fast and not too expensive. After looking around for some time we decided to go to Yuki. They have a big menu but we decided to go for their lunch offers, which was recommended from yelp. We settled with a vegetarian combo plate and a salmon and tuna combo plate. Included in the combo plates is a bowl of miso soup. The soup was OK, but it did not have that much of a flavour, other than the miso flavour. The sushi was good but the tuna sushi was definitely better and more fresh than the salmon sushi. This was served with a variety of different salads and noodles. 
I give Yuki 2 stars. The reason it doesn't get higher rating is the lack of variety and the high prices. For being a restaurant this far away from the city centre I was expecting better pricing. In my opinion thr only thing that's actually worth the money are the combo plates."}
{"text":"The positives:

Sushi was well cut. Good quality rice.  The hwae-dup bap salad was cut perfectly, vegetables clean.  The cho-gochuchang was ok.  The yellowtail sashimi was exquisite.

The negatives:

Nasty customers who know how to destroy a pleasant ambience - have their speaker-phones on their cell phones (loudly) in a quiet sushi place.  Unbelievable.  I feel badly for the wait staff in this place.

Bottom line.  Restaurant cannot control the behaviour of their customers.  Food was good.  Customers inconsiderate and rude."}
{"text":"Great selection Sushi not as
Large as previous owner but very fresh.  Very attentive service cleaned everything away quickly. Tempura good size portions."}
{"text":"More like Yucky. Didn't care for the service here, I'm trying to enjoy my meal while two waitresses are arguing with each other. Just completely wrecks the flow of any harmony - If your going complain to each other go do it in the kitchen at least. Wont go back."}
{"text":"I love this place, great ambiance, good food. Large rolls worth every penny. The special rolls look like a work of art. 

I usually get the fire mountain it is by far my favourite roll. 

Great place to take a date as it's private and decent spot."}
{"text":"Yuki's isn't the best sushi out there but it's pretty darn good if you're looking for something in the area. I'm not a big fan of sushi so I usually come into this Japanese-Korean restaurant and order from the back of the menu. From experience, the rolls here are huge! I can't eat it in one bite. Lots of rice, flavourful and very filling. The bento boxes are worth the value. Very filling and they do substitutions within reason. I find most meals will come with a salad and miso soup. The tempura I find just has way too much batter. My favourite though is the hwedupbap (basically a salad with raw fish). Hwedupbap is very fresh with a good amount of raw fish. The fish here is pretty fresh. Have never had a problem. 

They have private booths if you're lucky enough to grab one. It can get pretty busy here and when that happens, service is usually compromised. There's one or two people working at a time and being in a private booth you have to wave them down. Fruits at the end of every meal. Excellent way to clean the palate. It's a homey place that serves good food. Recommend if you don't want to travel far."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for dinner and we got the sushi boat D. 
The sushi was good, fresh and had just the right amount of rice.
I found the tuna nigiri had a bit more wasabi than the salmon though, so it surprised me when I alternated between the two.
The tempura was pretty batter-y, and oddly we got 1/4 of an onion in the tempura mix - definitely did not eat that."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden little gem in North York. The shrimp crunch rolls are great and their salad dressing is my fave ever! Great staff, friendly and food comes out very fast."}
{"text":"Really great sushi! Great service, some of the best I've had in Toronto. Recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"the place used to be excellent. i used to come here at least once a week. now the food quality is horrendous. i ordered chicken teriyaki, it smelled like sewage and tasted spoiled. their sushi comes with fish that's been sitting out for two days. after the last time i ate here i got a stomach ache. i understand trying to save a few bucks, but not at the expense of health!"}
