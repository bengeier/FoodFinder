{"text":"It's a nice place, well located, with excellent craft beer and decent food but if you order a Bloody Caesar, it is lame, especially for the hefty price. Come on Duggan. When I visited a few months ago, the cocktail came with... nothing. No celery, no olives. Was there even a lemon? Just a large bill. Caesars must be celebrated. Even in beer places. It's sacred. :)"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of growing to do.  I'm not sure what it wants to be.  A brew pub? Casual dining?  It suffers at both.

Some issues on my last visit (I have been twice)...

They were out of 3 beers.  You should NEVER be out of more then one beer at a place that has the name Brewery over the door

The beers are very good, but I don't like paying a different price depending on the beer I get.  $6.45 for one beer and $6.09 for another?  Really?  Come on.

The service was slow and inexperienced.  She cared, but needs better training.

The menu did not describe all the ingreediants in the food.  For example, my sandwich had mayo on it, but did not call that out on the menu.  I hate that."}
{"text":"I only gave this place 1 star because of the candied bacon.. Which was delicious. Our waitress (blonde hair, horrible picked-off-the-wall tattoos, and bitchy AF) was probably THE worst.

We got our food before we even got drinks When we did finally get our drinks.. mine sucked a big one. I ordered the Grapefruit Beer Cocktail, and it was absolutely horrible for a $14 drink. It really just tasted like straight beer, no grapefruit, maybe a little orange food colouring. 

Since I was unhappy with my beverage, I waited for our lovely server to come back to check on us. ... ... ... Didn't happen. It wasn't because they were busy mind you, she was just hitting on a guy at the bar. Interesting...
When I stood up and interrupted the budding love affair, I was given a super dirty look. Oh sorry, you need do to your job now? Well shit now I feel really bad - not.

She then argued with me about the contents of the drink. Of course... I was grateful to her for repeating the exact ingredients that were listed on the menu, that I read before ordering... The thing is it tasted like someone's asshole. Instead of wasting my breath on her, I simply put it on the bar infront of her and requested a simple shot of vodka. The only reason she got a tip was because my boyfriend paid, and he's nicer than me. However, it is with no regret that we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had a #5 and the pulled pork (lunch). The place was pretty empty. The food was good, not great. The beer was nice, light and refreshing. A good choice for lunch. It's hard not to compare to beer bistro. Beer bistro is better, but also a lot pricier. I think in both places you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Firstly, go here when you have 2000 calories to spare. 

Secondly, keep in mind that this is a microbrewery and sometimes they're just not brewing what you might feel like having. The time I went, they only had 4 beers on the menu. 1 stout, 1 london porter, a wheat and the last I cant remember. Luckily I like dark beer otherwise I would be shit out of luck.

Get.the.curry.poutine. No, get the duck confit poutine. Actually wait, get the curry poutine. Or..no, get the duck confit poutine. bahh, JUST GET THEM BOTH! They're surprisingly good. (I told you to spare 2000 calories!)

Other than the poutine and the beer and the pretty awesome 12,000 sq. ft space, there is something for everyone else on the menu, there are salads, beef ribs, corned beef, tuna steaks and even fresh oysters. 

I'm going to go back soon and if they give me a beer sampler (not on the menu), this will easily change into a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I have been to Duggan's on three occasions and I completely agree with Sam G. that it's a straight up three.  Actually Duggan's is really worthy of an additional half star for not calling itself a \"gastro pub\". 

Food is pretty good and the space is nice.  The beer can be a bit hit and miss.  I would definitely stay away from their \"Asian\" brew, it's borderline offensive.  Also, the last time I was there a friend wasn't happy with his desert, but I forget what the issue was."}
{"text":"The beer is good (you have to like craft brewed beer) but the food was nothing to write home about ... I had the Veg Curry and my Pops had the pulled pork sandwich. Both of us though that we had eaten better. I can see this place being good for after work drinks but for a good meal there are better places around."}
{"text":"So I guess I was let down upon trying this 'hipster' dive bar for the first time.  The food was great, the beer was average and our waitress was awesome.  However, my wife felt really uncomfortable when a creepy middle aged guy in a flat cap approached her after she left the bathroom area and claimed he was the owner. He made her feel really uncomfortable and we left immediately afterwards. Hopefully management gets this guy out of there because I can't give a positive review to a place with creeper deviants lingering around like predators."}
{"text":"Dropped by here last week with a group of friends while waiting on a reservation elsewhere.  Menu looked so good we ended up staying for dinner, and so glad we did.  pints are a great price, service is fast and theres lots of seating for groups.  The menu is still small, but looking forward to whats to come when they are fully open.  Also CANT WAIT for the retail shop. I dream of No. 9!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I had heard that Mike Duggan had finally gotten his own digs setup, I knew that I had to check it out as soon as possible. Overall, I was very pleased with the visit!

The atmosphere was a bit more upscale then I had expected, which was a pleasant surprise. Additionally, the food was definitely not pub-fare quality, as I have come to expect from brewery locals.The only minor complaint I noted was that the menu descriptions could have been a bit more detailed. I had the \"V and Chips\" (A hollowed out loaf of bread about 10 inches long filled with french fries, topped off with a curry sauce), which was very filling. Great place for a lunch with friends, not so sure about dinner. I'll have to try the steak and report back...

Anyone whose had brewery-fresh beer knows that it is in a league of it's own, and the selection at Duggan's brewery does not disappoint. For the uninitiated, I recommend ordering a flight of beers to sample the many varieties of ales and lagers on tap (For four small glasses, it comes to $6 after tax). The Asian Lager, Festbeer and #9 IPA were absolutely fantastic, and my buddy enjoyed his Porter and Stout very much.

The service during the lunch hour was somewhat sub-par. We were greeted and seated in a small window alcove with a high table and high chairs. While the arrangement was not necessarily cramped, it was a little tight. 

The waiter who took care of us made a multitude of mistakes... When we wanted to order samplers of beer, he did not explain to us that it was $6 for four samples. We tried to order three each, and instead of informing us of the pricing, he returned with four samples (omitting one of each of our requested drinks) and told us then then that it was six dollars for four samples. In retrospect, had we known, we would have just gotten four samples each. My friend was brought the wrong dish and had to wait an additional 10 to 15 minutes to get his food. When we asked for the bill to be split, the waiter told us that it would be no problem, returned with a single bill and told us to inform him of how we wanted to split it :\

I am going to dock them only one star for the service issues, as I had the impression that the waiter was new, and the beer was so good that I am willing to give them a pass on it. Being the beer hound that I am, I am going to be visiting this establishment many times in the near future."}
{"text":"Located around the way from the Eaton Centre in a nondescript part of town, Duggan's Brewery is a real good find!  With high ceilings, exposed bricks, minimal wall art and great floor space; this is a perfect gathering spot.  

Since this is a brewpub; they brew their own beer which means...wait for it...their pints are around $5!  There's a beer menu ranging from light lagers to stouts.  I tried most of the beer on the menu and enjoyed each one.

Their menu consists of salads and appetizers at around $10 and their main courses are around $20.  Their food is not pub fair nor gourmet fair; it's a mixture of both -- gourmet pub fair?  It's tasty but not overly stupendous. 

All-in-all a really great place to hang out for the night. Their waiters are in the traditional black pants, white shirt and black aprons which adds to the clean-cut ambiance.  It also looks like you can hold a party in the large empty space in their basement.  

Go to Duggan's!"}
{"text":"I've given this place too many chances. The beer teeters on being awful, and the staff vary from incompetent to insulting. The worst part is that, for a pub centered around beer, the staff have no idea how to pour a pint, and there's no decent bar to sit at.

And finally, there are some seriously suspicious characters who hang out here that you'll notice once the after-work-drink crowd leaves."}
{"text":"The beer was fantastic, I tried the Porter and the IPA. The Porter was dark and rich with a lovely roasted coffee flavour. It was heavy enough to be substantive, but not so much so that a second or a third couldn't be enjoyed. 

The IPA, is not your traditional Indian Pale Ale. It is not pale at all. It is actually a dark amber colour. This is a really interesting take on an IPA, because it is hoppy as one would suspect, but the hoppy-ness is mellow and lasting more like a barley based beer. 

The food was alright. I ordered the fish and chips, which were good, but certainly not particularly memorable. It seems that this is true for the rest of the menu as well. The beef goulash was described as being 'meh' and a little bit tough by my fiancee. So I tried a little bit and it definitely wasn't inspired.  

I do have to agree with some other critiques about the service, and lack of a beer menu. We had a reservation for 7:15, one of us got there at about 6:50 and was seated at the bar until the rest of us arrived. When we arrived the host sat the rest of us without letting us know that our friend was at the bar. It was nearly 7:30 before we figured out what had happened. 

Secondly, when I ordered my second beer, I asked the waitress what they had for lager type beers. She looked confused for a second and then offered me the IPA, which isn't a lager, but as you may have read above was quite good. If you are going to work at a brewery you should know the beers backwards and forwards. 

Based on some of the other reviews, my desire to give Duggan's a second chance may not be worth it. But those who have said that the beer is bad obviously didn't try either the Porter or the IPA,"}
{"text":"Walking into Mike Duggan's new spot is a bit of a polarizing experience for people it seems. The room is very big, and pretty bare with obvious signs that the renovation isn't done yet (and it isn't, there are great things coming soon). There are plenty of tables and counters to sit and have a drink, relax and maybe learn a little something about beer. That seems to freak some folks out for some odd reason.

At worst, you have a cool little brew-pub with great, friendly staff that are happy and eager to help you find something you'll like. That sounds like a pretty good proposition to me.

As for the people that are complaining about the patrons, get over yourself. It's 2014, hipsters don't exist anymore."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  I try my hardest with every visit.  I just can't bring myself to actually recommend it.  The most recent visit was as mediocre as the previous.

The food is expensive and not worth the price.  The beef goulash I had was actually pretty good, but the pizza and wings that my friends tried were less than stellar.  The salad was also described by a friend as \"salty\". 

The beer, which should be the focus of a visit, no longer has its own menu.  In fact, there's no beer menu at all.  The only listing we were provided was a hand-written list of 8 beers on a scrap of paper that completely lacked any description.  It was also taken away from us halfway through our night so they could give it to another table.  I guess  they didn't have the time to hand scrawl another list?  The waitress explained that the beer selection turns over too quickly to keep a menu up-to-date.  A brewery without a beer menu is disappointing.

The service was also nothing special, with the waitress oscillating between somewhat kind and somewhat rude.  Did I mention there were also a couple of fruit flies that were bothersome the entire meal?"}
{"text":"A new brewpub in Parkdale. The area doesn't really have a brewpub and this one will cater to the area's hipster crowd and professionals. The food is limited and awaiting for Jamie Kennedy to take over as their chef before they do their grand opening. I like their Duggan's 9 beer and I can tell this will be another hangout for me on nights that The Sister is busy."}
{"text":"Let's all remember that this is a brewery.  So in my opinion we should focus on the beer first - and I can say that I enjoy Duggan's beers - especially the price.  The stout is my favourite.  Number 9 is now bottled and sent around town (note the bottle size is only 275ml) so maybe it is best to drink it here.

The food and service.... I agree it is hit or miss.  The pizzas look impressive here, in fact most menu items are generous in size and taste, although it may not be the most healthy of menus - but hey this is a brewery people."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. I live right around the corner, and  regularly go to both bellwoods and indie alehouse. Unfortunately it just wasn't there for me. *Sigh* Maybe it was because it was a bit early (only a few weeks), but everything felt a little disjointed. While the #9 IPA was great, all of there other beers were a bit... lacking. I tried both the hefeweizen (which was flat and watery) and the sorachi, which unfortunately didn't do the hop justice. 
While I could have accounted this to growing pains, it was really the server who threw me. She clearly had very little beer knowledge. Every time I attempted to ask a question, I just got a sample (which, while I appreciated), I'd also like to know a little bit more about the beer than whats on the menu (thats the benefit of going right to the source, right?). I hate to say this, but she seemed like she may have had one too many samples herself ... she was a bit all over the place. 
For that reason, I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good if you like light easy drinking beers with friends. Space feels large. Good for groups.  special mentions: triple Belgian smooth crisp and citrusy without being too sweet. Raspberry Weiss good mild raspberry flavour. Service was attentive.  They offer flights and a variety of drink sizes."}
{"text":"Great place, fantastic beer. 
They have moved to a cozier space in the basement of the original space. 
Entrance is now off Brock Street just north of Queen, downstairs. (look for the red Xmas lights) 
The menu is mostly pizza and tacos now but still very delicious and of course, the beer is, as always, great."}
{"text":"I showed up on a Saturday at 12:30 am and it was closed.  Maybe the poor atmosphere makes people leave early? Was here before once and the service was bad. Tried to give it another chance and it was closed at midnight. What a joke of a bar. Go to Rhino guys."}
{"text":"Duck confit poutine was pretty yummy for a Merican.  

Stuck in a hotel with a head cold but managed to drag myself out for some lunch.  Didn't have any beer, unfortunately.

But some tea and comfort food had me feeling better."}
{"text":"obsessed with those lemon pepper chicken wings!  made of magic,  whoever is cookin in the back sold their soul to the devil.."}
{"text":"I've been here on 3 separate occasions - once when it first opened, a year later, and just yesterday.

My first visit was satisfying. Had the Parkdale Bomber, a malt-liquor style beer. Service was quick and bartender lady with bright orange/red hair was very helpful and knowledgable about beer.

The second time I went, their kegs were set up strangely and kept pouring out a ton of head so we had to wait a really long time to get our beers. It seemed to happen to almost every beer and all night.

Yesterday night our bartender said he couldn't do beer flights but could do 5 oz. pours ($2.50-$3.50) of any beer we wanted. Oh...okay? Isn't that basically the same as a beer flight? I don't think he understood the concept of a beer flight - four 5 oz. tasters. 

He could've easily sold us $10 each worth of beer right then and there. So we each ordered two 5 oz. tasters and of course a couple of them had a lot of head due to a fussy keg. And then we just settled our bill because we didn't want to continue getting head-y sample pours.

And you know what's annoying? When your bill is $13.50 and you pay with $20, and they give you this change: a $5 bill, a loonie and some change."}
{"text":"Awesome communal vibe and home brews on tap. Had the brisket and was very impressed. Great spot."}
{"text":"A) Brewery: An establishment dedicated to brewing beer.

B) Duggan's brewery: A brewery opened by Michael Duggan (Known for his co-ownership of Mill St. Brewery and his award winning beers)

Neither description (A) nor (B) states anything about spectacular food.

So, if you want fantastic reasonably-priced-original-flavored beers, this is the place!  There are 8 beers on the menu, I tried 4 of them.  #9 IPA,  the stout, Belgian Tripple (holy crap that is a strong beer), and the London ale.

The beer that I liked the most was the #9.  I usually drink girly fruit beers and ales, but this one went down really easy.  

The food is alright, but definitely not the star of the show.
The poutine with duck confit .... gravy was very flavorful.
However the slimey, grey duck chucked on top looked unappetizing.
But still tasted good.

Pulled pork sandwich, not saucy enough on a slightly burnt onion bun.
The crispy onions in the sandwich made each bite interesting and crunchy...(but again not saucy enough).
They brought me fries instead of salad. Grr.

My friend had the pie which looked piping hot and tasty with a  flaky crust.  
The mashed potatoes that accompanied the pie were just... mashed potatoes.

*Overall, the service was fantastic.
*Nice looking venue, it's neat to see the brewing machinery as you walk-in.
*Located just far enough from the Eaton center so it's not packed with mall-goers. Great spot for all the condo/loft dwellers of Lombard and Richmond.

I can see why this place is super packed for dinners (A two hour wait on a Friday).

I would actually give this place 3.75 stars..which rounds up to 4.

{"text":"Was stuck in Toronto traffic,happened to pass by this place so we decided to stop and glad we did! Wide selection of beers (about 10 on tap). All kinds so you're bound to find one you like. They also food and a dessert \"du jour.\" I highly recommend the fries. They are freshly cooked and come with an amazing mayo dip! The building is large with a lot of seating."}
{"text":"Duggan's Brewery is a great spot for fresh beer and pub food. I've been ordering their stout since finding out how delicious it is, so I don't know yet about the other beers. On the beer menu there is a IBU rating for each of their brews along with the alcohol level (specific gravity). This is interesting to look at as the IPAs which are hoppier are more bitter too, so score higher on the IBU. A wheat or weiss beer is at the other end. Useful!
The food looked amazing with piled high burgers and piles of jerk chicken popular items that I saw when I visited. Everyone looked happy!
They have daily brewing happening in the basement along with some live music with tours available, so it is a happening spot. I first had their stout at Painted Lady where the brewery was sponsoring a Duggan's with free oysters as a promo. I was hooked! This place is worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Local neighborhood brewery with 10-15 beers on tap.  Lots of variety in styles of beers, our favorites were the number 9 IPA and the Belgium triple.  Tatiana, and Rene were  most hospitable to a couple of beer loving visitors, and had great suggestions of places to visit, eat and drink.  Food was good, and beer was a good match.  They also have growlers to go 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great local watering hole located right inside parkdale. Very friendly service and a nice casual atmosphere. Nice layout w wooden benches and tables, creates a warm environment. They sell they're own brew as well for purchasing separately or in six packs which is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This place has such potential. The beer is great (I had the hefeweizen, which gives my usual German brand a run for its money) and the space is gigantic. The walls are lined with TVs, which is great for the sportswatchers in our lives. But they really need to work out the service. We were there on a busy Saturday night. Every seat was taken and it took forever to get any service. As far as I could tell, there was one manager and two (three, tops) servers on the floor. We were often sitting around, staring at each other over empty pint glasses, while the servers ran around trying to fulfill everyone's orders. They were super friendly, but stretched.

I'll likely go back and buy some of that beer from the store, but I don't think I'll be back to hang out."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Duggan's. I have to state that I may have a bias because they allowed us to rent the downstairs space for FREE for a charity event. We did eat dinner and were treated extremely nicely by the staff. Our waiter was quick and very accommodating since we kept on adding more people to the table on a busy Saturday night. We ate some oysters to begin with and they were delicious particularly with the hot jerk sauce that they are served with. For my dinner I had the duck confit poutine and my boyfriend had the curry poutine. We also tried almost all the beers throughout the night and they were all excellent. 
For the charity event we had the use of the bar downstairs and the ladies that were our bartenders were very sweet and lovely. 
I will for sure be going back to eat more oysters and try some different items from the menu."}
{"text":"Walked into the brewpub on a Sunday night. The brewpub while large, was mostly empty. My wife and I wanted to sample some of their beers. We walked up to the bar and the bartender -- seemingly the sole employee working at the time -- in lieu of greeting us, told us that the kitchen was closed.

We had previously eaten and merely wanted to sample some beer. We asked the bartender for a flight. Overtly annoyed, she informed us that flights were not normally served after 8 PM but that she would make an exception.

We looked over the menu and placed our order only to be informed that two of the four beers we wanted in our flight were not available even though they were written on the chalkboard menu. We modified our order and the bartender served us.

After tasting the beer, we were even more disappointed as the beers were mediocre. Two of the four beers we tasted had high levels of off flavors (DIACETYL OVERLOAD).

This is easily one of the worst breweries we have ever visited."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last weekend.  The beer was good, there's plenty of variety to choose from.  I ordered a flight and sampled the Sorachi Lager, Stout, IPA, and Raspberry Weiss.  All were good for different reasons, but went with the Lager in the end.  

The food was decent, not spectacular.  The macaroni and beef short ribs tasted a little strange, like the ribs had a raw overpowering vinegar flavour.  Beef was very tender.  Cheese sauce on the macaroni was nice.  My friend ordered duck poutine.  He liked it.  My wife ordered chicken caeser salad.  The chicken was dry as sawdust.

Our first waitress ended her shift and a new waitress took over.  The first waitress never placed our food order with the kitchen.  Second waitress apologized and gave us a round of drinks on the house.  The service was extremely slow, but the staff, the food, drink, and atmosphere were all good.  1 hour and 40 minutes is a long time to wait for poutine!

We'll go back and give it another shot someday, but we're in no rush.."}
{"text":"Duggan's has a great fresh beer selection and the interior is nice - lots of space, cool lighting, kind of like a fancier sports bar/brewery combo. I really liked the two beers I had, the German pilsner and the 100 mile lager. I would skip the food here. The burger was priced at $17, okay, then I added cheese ($2) and asked for regular fries instead of potato sticks ($2). Not that I need to eat a mountain of fries, but they brought me the fries in literally the smallest cup I've ever seen - must have been like 20 fries in it. Not cool to charge extra for FRIES first of all, but if you're going to, at least make it a decent size. As for the burger, the waitress (who was very nice) told us that they would be cooked \"medium, medium rare\". Awesome! Then it came, and was the most overcooked, well-done, dry beef that I've ever had...fully gray. Very disappointing since the meal was ending up at $21 (more expensive than dinner at Terroni, for example). We ate the burgers anyway, told the waitress at the end, she seemed apologetic. Not that the restaurant HAS to do this, but it's a really easy thing to knock a couple dollars off the meal when you were not served what you were told you were getting. Simple customer service that makes customers want to come back. I didn't want to send it back immediately because I hate wasting food but some sort of acknowledgement on the bill would have put a better taste in my mouth. 

Toward the end of the night, Raptors game on, place got really busy and the service fell apart. Looked like there was a 2-3 servers, including ours who was also bartending. Took a long time to get the bill.

Overall, might drop in for a pint or two, but will not bother eating there again, feel kinda ripped off."}
{"text":"Love this brewery!  Lots of great beers to choose from, cozy and friendly atmosphere and pretty good food.  Nice high ceiling interior and  great location."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Chicken ski deep fried is awesome. But server needs to get better in knowing what is going on."}
{"text":"Poutine and duck confit should never, under any circumstances, form part of the same sentence. 

I had an opportunity to attend at Duggan's last week for a work holiday lunch function. It's directly across the street from my office, so it was a natural choice. Plus, a new place in the sea of overpriced Italian restos and hotel restaurants that is the Richmond/Victoria area was a welcome change of pace. 

Duggan's is bare bones when it comes to decor and, dare I say, atmosphere. This review may be skewed by that fact that a) I'm pregnant and therefore not partaking of ales at this point in time or b) Because I visited this place during the early afternoon on a Friday or even c) Because the place is so large and brewery-like that they are clearly having trouble keeping it heated to a level acceptable by mammals. It was freeeeezing in there. 

The service is excellent, but the menu is overreaching. If you want pork on your pizza, or pulled pork on your sandwich or a burger, I heard all good things from my lunch mates. If you want poutine, which is seemingly such an easy thing to NOT ruin, don't order it here. I didn't order it, because the gravy is not gravy. It is duck confit. The poutine (which they conveniently leave out of the description) is also topped with pieces of greasy, chopped up duck meat. Gross. 

I ended up being really confused by the gravy situation and ended up with a plate of fries in front of me. Simply, I cannot base this entire experience on what I ate, because it's hard to eff up fries. 

The service was great, especially considering the waitress serving our table was serving about 12 people single-handedly and didn't flinch when the most annoying \"can we have separate bills\" inquiry was tabled. 

The menu is littered with glorified pub foods and a few dishes with which they are bleakly attempting to be creative, i.e. duck confit poutine. 

If you go and try the beers or try the weird poutine, let me know. I'm curious."}
{"text":"For those of you who who don't know, Toronto is going through the beginning of a beer revolution (beer-olution?). Leading the charge is Mike Duggan is well known for his work with Mill Street (creating their formerly great Tankhouse) , and generally being well known in beer circles in Toronto. The honest truth is, I believe that Mike Duggan might be the best English Speaking brewmaster in Canada. Having recently won the best IPA challenge in Cask days at Volo Duggans opens his new establishment.

While at this establishment, I tried the Weissbeer and the Tripple. The service was good, the beer was good. I didn't eat anything, so I can't speak for their food. The waiter was really nice though.  I liked ambiance in the bar, though it still is under construction at this point so I can't really say for final. This is definitely one of the new \"it\" spots for Beer in Toronto though. It's worth going to."}
{"text":"Great venue for hosting private events. 

We recently booked it for Pecha Kucha presentations and the staff/venue far exceeded expections. Food was great, beer was great, space was very reasonably priced and everyone enjoyed themselves. 

Great AV equipment, private bar downstairs, and lots of room for around 100 people. 

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm normally a very patient person when it comes to service. I don't mind waiting for my food, even longer than normal, and I'm not difficult to please when it comes to the taste of said food I am waiting on. It takes a lot to irk me when being waited on. Having said that, I was plenty irked by the time we left Duggan's. I would say I was at a maximum irk level. 

Here's why. 

The place was incredibly understaffed and even though the place wasn't full, one waitress can not take on that many tables, which is why we were treated more like an inconvenience than customers. 

Our drink order came about 25 minutes after ordering. When I finally decided to have a drink as well and wait another 20 minutes for a scotch on the rocks, it was plunked in front of me with no ice. I decided not to inconvenience the waitress and go to the bar to ask for ice in my glass where the bartender looked at me like I had some form of leprosy, and chucked a couple of cubes in my glass. 

I had the veggie burger, and while Toronto restaurants never usually disappoints with vegetarian fare, Duggan's completely underwhelmed me with a falling apart, bland, cold veggie burger. I had to go to Harvey's right after to satiate the craving I had all day of looking forward to a good veggie burger. If Harvey's can do it better, you need to figure out how to step is up a notch, especially for $12.

We then waited another 45 mins to pay our bill at which point we just had to get up and stand close to the pay station. 

I can't entirely blame the waitress for the lack of service; poor management was the obvious culprit behind our experience, topped with expensive, lackluster food and a rocks-less scotch. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Lets start off with the fact they take reservations. This can be a negative if you just want to stop in and not sit at a communal table or at the bar, but when you're actually planning on coming here, this was a perk for us that worked in our favour.
I also think the atmosphere is good, with the right amount of room between tables, enough natural light to be comfortable, and music that was hit and miss but not played at an overwhelming level which made it perfectly tolerable despite the odd transitions (Red Hot Chili Peppers into Garth Brooks was a prime example).

Beerwise, I was surprised to see they only offer flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays which was a bit of a disappointment. But they have what I'd guess to be a good 8 different types of beer on tap which are priced between $6.75 and $8.75 per pint. As is the case for smaller brewers, some beers are better than others which is why the flights are nice if they had've been an option. The Duggan's 9 IPA is a safe choice if you like hoppy and bitter flavours, and probably their best selling beer (since it is readily available in a lot of LCBO's in tallboy format). Surprisingly, the 99 Double IPA was actually a bit of a let down and seemed a bit flat in flavour comparably. The Sorachi Lager I thought had a weird aftertaste and didn't really impress. The Parkdale Bomber was actually the surprise of the night with it's 7% malted lager which packs a nice punch but still has a certain smoothness to it.

Foodwise, we started with the Chicken Crackle and Beer Candied Bacon. They both came out quickly and were tasty and worth their $5-6 price tags. As a main I went with the Miami Beef Short Ribs ($14) which were also quite good along with its accompanying potato salad, and surprisingly brought out before I could even finish my first pint which is a rarity lately. I think the Candied Bacon was actually the best thing I ate, which is why I even ordered another round for dessert while we finished our drinks.

Good food, decent beer, nice environment. Sounds like a 4 star review to me."}
{"text":"I came by here for an afternoon beer and I really enjoyed it. The first thing I noticed was the cool leather coasters, definitely a nice little detail. I sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender for a bit while having a pint of their weissbier. I'd say the staff if extremely friendly and I was very impressed with the beer. The weissbier has a naturally occurring banana  hint to it...pretty cool.

Give it a shot of you're near by...Apparently the No. 9 IPA is the big seller here...sadly I've yet to try it."}
{"text":"Had a nice date here with the bae on Friday night.

We ordered a couple of pints and enjoyed the vibe of this place overall.

To share, we decided on the fried jerk chicken wings, which were delicious. Bae ordered the baseball steak and I opted for a soup and salad.

I tried a bite of the steak which was very tasty and the side of smashed/fried red potatoes were oh so good. I enjoyed my french onion soup and arugula salad as well.

I would return if I was in the area again :)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised the average rating for Duggan's isn't over 4 stars. We had an AMAZING meal for soooo cheap. I couldn't believe it when the bill came and it was only $45. I thought they had left something off it! 

I only had a Caesar salad, but it was one of the better ones I've had - thought definitely went into that yummy garlicky dressing, which is more than I can say for most places in Toronto. My dining partner had the pulled pork sandwich - one of the best he's had in a very long time. He could not say enough about the blue cheese coleslaw as well! 

Beers were good and CHEAP. Perfect combo. 

Service was mediocre at best though - not very friendly, hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"The beer here is still dynamite. The food tastes good, and the atmosphere is still nice, but I've visited 3 more times and the service was SO SLOW.
I won't be back except to buy growlers."}
{"text":"typical bar food.  Nothing amazing.  Oysters at $2/a shuck was great.  The matzah ball soup was salty, their green salad was OK, their steak sandwhich was all fat.  The service was good but the food wasn't enough for me ever to go back."}
{"text":"Come here for the beer and not for the service or food.

I came here on a Friday night sat by the window. When we arrived we were told to sit where ever we want. We sat down and waited for about 5 minutes before someone came by. The guy who served us was not friendly. Almost seemed like he's doing a favor to serve us. Anyway, we ordered a flight. Then later ordered our food. I ordered the burger and asked for it to cooked medium rare. We also ordered the Cajun wings. The burger arrived, somehow, it was juicy and dry at the same time. The meat was packed way too tightly and was flavourless. The potato sticks it came with were decent, but portion was way too small - less than a child's handful. The burger was so dry that I had to wash it down with beer.  The wings were ok. Didn't think they were anything to write home about. There was barely any seasoning in it. After we finished eating, the server came by and asked if we wanted the bill....while we were considering ordering another beer. We told him we were thinking about ordering another flight, then he just kind of stood there and waited for us to decided. I kindly of felt pressured and rushed. 

Anyway, we won't be going back for food. I'd give 2 stars for food, 4 stars for beer, 2 stars for service. Si 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"I really liked Duggan's. Even thought the bartender was in the weeds when we were sitting at the bar, he was still really nice and tried his best to not make us wait. The beer is good, we got free oysters, and it's a comfortable place.

We tried a few of the beers, had a salmon salad, and the chef who came over to help the overextended bartender (Really? one bartender for a place that big??!) kept serving us oysters on the house! 

Fortunately there were 2 of us, and we got there just after 6 on a Wednesday night. This place is big (I think there's even a patio?) and it was still rammed full of people of all ages.

Interesting note for you ladies - there were way more men than women here, and it's more upscale than a sports bar. Just an FYI from your neighborhood matchmaker. *

*Not really. I am not a good matchmaker. But I can tell you where the men are. That's important too!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with a group of friends and had a fun later part of Friday night. It wasn't packed and I liked the communal table vibe. I didn't try the food but a few of my friends loved the crispy chicken. Another enjoyed a flight of beer. I'm a long time fan of their beer and enjoyed their double IPA and always the 9. It's great to see local breweries taking a shot at a different kind of brewpub. A little \"hipster-y\" but worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great beer gets it 3 stars. Unfortunately, the food fails to live up to its descriptions. I was really excited to try the duck confit poutine, but found it overdone and soggy and served in a bowl, when a wider plate would have been more appropriate to show off the duck. The corned beef sandwich was not corned beef, it was roast beef."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, great place to chill with friends and enjoy good company. The number 9 is my favourite beer. This place is rad because the bartenders are really friendly and non-pretentious. The decor is super cute and it feels very laid-back country glam. 

ALSO THEIR FOOD IS AMAZING their tacos are to die for and make sure you try their ribs."}
{"text":"I've been here two times and both times it wasn't that busy but it seemed understaffed. Service is slow on both occasions, servers dismissed us a a few times on both occasions, and we had to wait 15-20 min after we asked for the bill."}
{"text":"Interesting new addition to Parkdale is a restaurant operated by Duggan's.  Brewery might be a misnomer as none of their beers are brewed there.

The ATMOSPHERE is pretty cool.  It has a spacious laid back feel...music levels appropriate to conversation.  Complemented by friendly and attentive staff.

The FOOD was a bit hit and miss.  Value was generally missing as portion sizes were quite small for the price.   We liked the meat/veggie board, but portions were awfully tiny.  The tacos (at $15 for 3) are pricy and again the flavour was sort of there, but not quite enough.  The beef brisket ($16) was dry, and there was reluctance at the table to even finish it.  Maybe they're still working some quirks out.

The BEER is solidly below average.  Their No. 9 IPA is definitely the winner of the pack...also available at the LCBO, and packs a pleasantly hop-forward, but not palate-destroying punch.  I found most of the rest of the beers to be both very malt-forward, sweet, and on the bland side.  I wanted to like the 100 Mile Ale, but the malts overwhelmed, the admirably local hops.  

SERVICE was good...attentive, friendly, accurate.

In a very strange quirk, they have a to-go section for beer.  Given that I don't think they're actually brewing any beer at this location, this isn't exactly legal under Ontario's draconian alcohol laws.  That being said, I'm not about to complain about any alternative to the LCBO for buying craft beer...and don't even get me started on the beer store.

OVERALL, good atmosphere & service, average food, and below-average beer.  I'll probably be back sometime."}
{"text":"Fellow yelper, Derek H., would make fun of me because I'm yelping about this now.  We went out yesterday with our co-workers (former co-workers for me) to Duggan's Brewery for his birthday.

We had a group of about 10 people or so - and we were greeted by the funniest host ever.  A part of our group was already at Duggan's - we were there around 5:30 or so, so there weren't that many people there yet.

The group of us went full out and ordered a LOT of food, including the following:
1) CURRY POUTINE:  Okay, so I was curious - and possibly craving a lot of poutine. I didn't find it as bad as most of the yelpers were saying; however, the fries weren't as crispy as I hoped they would be.
2) DUCK CONFIT POUTINE:  The funny thing was this - those who had the curry poutine first, liked the curry poutine better.  Those who liked the duck confit poutine first, liked the duck confit poutine better.  I had the curry poutine first, so I liked it better.  However, the duck confit poutine wasn't too bad.  I guess I was looking for some kick.
3) ONION RINGS:  The onion rings weren't bad.  I thoroughly enjoyed the house made #9 IPA ketchup - best sauce EVER.
4) OYSTERS: At $2 per oyster, you can't go wrong.  I'm not going to lie - this was the first time I've ever had oyster (GASP!)  I actually really liked it - the spicy cocktail sauce gave it a good kick as well.
5) PORK HOCK: Okay - so this was deliciousness on a plate, but I could bias because I have a weird affinity for all things pork (or bacon).   The smoked pork hock was HUGE (it says double portion - but you could basically feed 3-4 people.. that also ate the above items).  It was a bit fatty, but what do you expect from a pork hock?  The cider kraut was a great compliment to the pork hock.  Definite recommend.
6) BEEF CHUCK RIBS:  One of my co-workers ordered this and he said it was absolutely delicious.  I didn't get to try, but it looked really good.

Overall, a great experience at Duggan's.  Beer was good too (I can't remember the name of my beer, but it was the lightest one - I actually wish I went a bit darker).  Food was a bit more on the expensive side compared to out pubs though.  Service was okay - our waitress was quick on her feet, yet she seemed to have a bit of an attitude.

A great plus was that they were playing Beatles throughout the night."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a coworker we brought a group of people here for lunch. I was expecting your typical grimy pub but this is a very interesting, clean and trendy restaurant, bar and microbrewery.  Decor is muted grey with dark wood trim. Tabletops are an expensive feeling thick natural wood and the chairs and stools are a dark wood colour that matches the trim and bar.  The grey tile flooring completes the stark and cold look of a brewery.  The view of Victoria street is unimpressive but the copper set-pieces of brewery equipment on the mainfloor and basement are eye-catching. 

No free parking is available but there are limited meter spots just outside and a pay parking lot just north of the restaurant.  Service is attentive and follow the brewery theme.  The server wore a white blouse, black pants and a hip apron.  

Their lunch menu is slim in content but cleanly presented. Their specialty is obviously their own brand of beers including lagers, IPA and the rest.  All of which my coworkers assured me were good. On the food front I ordered the braised chuck beef rib ($18) while my coworkers ordered the fish and chips (~$14) and a curry poutine (~$10).  Yes, curry poutine.  

The braised beef rib is a large piece of beef chuck including the rib bone with caramelized onions on top of steamed veggies. Although quite moist the flavour of the meat was much like the decor ... muted.  The caramelized onions were great and the braise sauce was very mild.  Veggies of green beans and carrots were good.  Overall the dish was good but forgettable.  I will not order again ... not because it was bad, but it wasn't something I would normally get.  If you're looking for a pork back-ribs they also have that (as an appetizer, I don't know why).

The fish and chips appeared quite nice, not too battery, and the fries (which I did try) were tasty.  They must use some herbs on them.  The curry poutine was massive.  It's a meal for sure.  

This place is a little expensive for lunch and as I'm not much of a beer drinker, the food and decor do not offer much."}
{"text":"Really rude patrons don't want you to intrude on their private completely empty brewery. If you're at all into having a good time or smiling, steer clear of this place. Portions are small and overpriced."}
{"text":"I so desperately wanted to love Duggan's. Alas, that place is 'spensive for what they're offering!

I had the Pan-seared Tuna Sandwich. It was bland, the bun was limp, and it was served with a sad side salad: spring mix only, overdressed, no accompaniments. Truly amateur.

My partner ordered the Fish & Chips, which were sort of comfortingly boring. Except the fries were limp. The worst part was that it came with a little ramekin of blue cheese coleslaw. The coleslaw would have made absolutely sense when served with the Buffalo Wings, which is clearly what it was made for, but someone thought they could cut corners by pairing it with breaded halibut as well. Yikes, a horrifying flavour combination! It all just smacked of laziness.

While the No. 9 IPA is very good, I actually had to send my first pint back. Why? Because the glass it came in reeked like sour bar towel. I know the smell well from working in restaurants. Bar towels get mildewy if you leave them out overnight and don't change them the next day. So if you use them to dry a pint glass, the pint glass gets really smelly and wafts into your face every time you take a sip of beer. Ew.

Sending a beer back because it stinks like old bar towel is admittedly a weird complaint. But I doubt the server needed to come back with my new beer and say patronizingly, \"Here you are, a new glass cleaned especially for you!\" They cleaned a glass properly just for me? Aw shucks."}
{"text":"I thought it would be a perfect place to bring a party of ten for dinner and drinks.  But tonight the wait service gets Duggan's 2 stars. We had a group of ten at 7pm on a Friday night.  I'm not paranoid but it was as if our waiter was avoiding us the whole time and everyone had a bad service experience because of it.  Still I kept smiling, wondering if he was having an off night, but then he seemed quite content so I have no idea why he was nowhere to be found.  I should have started getting drinks for everyone from the bar.  Though he never once apologized for taking forever and forgetting drink orders.  I was embarrassed and my friends teased me \"thanks for bringing us here.\" We sat for way too long with empty glasses in front of us. In three hours my friend could only get two glasses of beer because she sat with her back to the rest of the room so she could not see when our waiter was in our section so she could catch his attention.  A friend arrived late and after ordering a beer, it took over 40 minutes for it to arrive.  The waiter gave it to him for free because it took so long.  We had to wait for him to drink it after everyone had finished.  I think this is the worst service I have ever had.  Honestly.  If the beer wasn't delicious it would have one star.  A new place like this can't afford to have the world's worst waiter.  In the end the gratuity was included on our bill.  $50 he didn't deserve.  We paid it and left feeling stupid.  Not the way I wanted to celebrate my friend's birthday at all."}
{"text":"Last night I made a return visit to Duggan's; it had been 2-3 years since my last visit and I was there for a bigger Event with a social Group I'm a Member of.  Here's some history about Duggan's: they were previously located at Victoria St. in the Downtown Core, then they re-opened as a pop-up in their current location in 2014.  They became a full-fledged Brewery/Brewpub by the end of that year and - although I didn't find out the full story until last night - they're currently renovating their main floor, therefore they're currently open in their lower floor space only, with a live band space just inside the entrance from outside.

I visited the Brewery a number of times when they were on Victoria St., at least once when they re-opened as a pop-up and I was there when they had an Event on their 1st day as a full Brewery.  I've also been back several times for Events with my aforementioned social Group, one of which included a tour of their beer making facilities downstairs.  As they now need to accommodate live band and customer space, etc. the lower floor now looks radically different - it now resembles a long corridor, but with a fair bit of seating overall.

Last night all of their beers avail. were only $6 which was a pretty great deal; I had 2 beers, both of which I quite enjoyed.  I've never really eaten at Duggan's so I can't really comment on their food but I understand that it's mostly pizza and tacos that are on offer.  I heard that 3 bands performed just during the time that I/my Group was there and both the musical instruments played and music performed were quite unique.  There was Bar service which was quite prompt considering that it was pretty crowded and became more so as it got later.  The entire downstairs area open to customers had a 'make-shift' appearance so I'm not sure what's in store for the space once the upstairs renovations are complete but there might not be any major changes at first as I believe the live space downstairs was installed when their main floor was still open.

I'll consider posting an updated review if/when I visit their main floor once it's re-opened and I have an opportunity to see how it's changed.  In the meantime the lower floor entrance is on Brock St.; look for the red Christmas lights and a stairway going down at the northwest corner of the building."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Duggan's.  They brew their beer onsite and you can buy beer to take home.

Gord ordered Crispy Chickpeas and Lemon Pepper Chicken Wings.  Both were really good (I do like their lemon pepper wings and have had them in the past).

I ordered Jerk Chicken.  It was good ... it had a nice hot spice to it.

Emily was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Went with a large group of friends. I don't know what happened that night. 

The waiter was rude. The manager kept stalking around us. Then the manager got even weirder and brought out a sack for my god son to play with....um he's 1.5 years old and i don't see how he claimed this was his daughters favourite toy. newsflash, kids can suffocate and strangle themselves quite easily. 

the brews were good.
The food was not.

I had the octopus and it was ok. I had the beef ribs and they were cooked to leather chewing quality. I sent them back and got the same thing, just a different piece. ah well. I wasn't expecting much better and had lost my appetite by then. Everyone thought the food was just ok.

The interior is ok as well. It could use a little bit of work.

The menu looks good. It's like a chef thought of this menu, and then was fired... leaving a cook to execute it. Whoever is in charge of the kitchen is not doing a good job.  

duggan's can be so much better. it just isn't.  it needs a new management team entirely."}
{"text":"5 stars for the type of place this joint pulls off with ease. Clean, fun, well placed tables and chairs perfect for large or smaller gatherings, along with a good selection of local beer, and amazing food gives this place a great review and approval by me!! It's not a restaurant or fine dining place. This place is a 5 star, like I said, because it's more of a perfect sit-down-be-somewhat-loud-drink-and-eat-and-have-fun party joint. The staff are pretty cool, personable, friendly and efficient. There's a large screen TV near the back of the joint close to one of their large tables - perfect for watching a sports game during your party-outing adventure.

I came here twice. Once with a friend after riding our bikes together - we had a pint and their amazing Jerk Chicken, and a week later with that same friend but for his bachelor party with many more guys. Both times, both different sized friendship gatherings, fun was had."}
{"text":"This place had all the pieces of a good bar, but I felt like they didn't quite come together.  Food was ok..atmosphere was weird. Jazz band (I think) in an overly lite room.  I thought it was illegal to do that.  Didn't like getting dripped on by the leaking roof. Or feeling like I was bugging our server when I asked for a beverage. The beers they brew are good. Which is positive.   Maybe everything else will catch up in time."}
{"text":"I'm never coming here again.  I have given Duggan's too many chances (yesterday was my third visit staggered over several months); I want it to be awesome, but it always leaves me unsatisfied and slightly angry.

The good:
- Everything here has always been \"okay\" but I have never had anything really good (or even medium good).
- It's huge so there is usually a table
- They're lucky/strategic in that there is nothing else around this area
- It is very clean and the bathrooms are always clean even when it's busy

The bad:
- See Vivek's review for the lowdown on our crazy cokeface waiter night from earlier in the year - this was one of the weirdest service experiences I have ever had in my life... looking back on it, we probably should have complained on our way out, but I think we were all too stunned
- Yesterday, other patrons whispered to me upon exiting \"don't get the corned beef\" and I was like... shit, I just ordered that... but they hated it so much they wanted to tell me about it 
- The corned beef is not corned; it's just a roast beef sandwich. it was actually an okay roast beef sandwich, but it was not what the menu advertised.  I was less offended than the other party (but it's still not even close to corned beef).
- We seemed to remember the beer here being cheap, but then when we got our bill, it was not.  It was $6.68 a pint.
- The food was also not cheap.  Sandwiches are between $12-$15.  Our bill for lunch yesterday was $45 (before tip) for two sandwiches ad two beers.  If the food had been awesome I wouldn't have minded spending that much, but the food was mediocre and I get a better roast beef sandwich at Bonjour Brioche or Brick Street Bakery for $8.
- This is personal taste, but I have never loved my beer here.  I like number 9 on draught at other places, but I always try something else when I am here because I can get 9 anywhere... and whatever I get is always okay but it has never been special or made me HAVE to come back to have it again.
- Mike and I quickly did the math on their growlers and they aren't really a great deal, and you can't refill them.

Overall, I will probably forget how much I am unsatisfied and underwhelmed by Duggan's in a few months and I'm sure I will end up here again, and I'm sure it will be crappy because it always is.  I don't recommend that you go here at all, but it is a lot better than 1 star... I might give it 3 stars if it wasn't so expensive."}
{"text":"How do you choose a drink from a list of eight wonderful brewed-in-house beers? One at a time until you've tried them all! 

I'm actually just kidding, cuz one pint of the rich 9.9% Belgian Trippel sipped at a \"normal\" pace might get you plenty full and tipsy already. In fact, because of this very fact, Duggan's is soon going to only serve these in smaller glasses. For those who can stomach it, you better hurry in and get your hands on these full pints while you still can. I'm a fan of IPA's myself and Duggan's famous #9 did not disappoint. Amongst my table mates, the Weissbier and German Pilsner were also big hits.

On this late weeknight, both the dining room and bar area were completely full. By default, we started off up at the bar where we were perfectly situated to watch the friendly English barman select and shuck our incredibly fresh dozen Mallet and Raspberry Point oysters ($3 each). Later, both the hostess as well as our server were incredibly helpful and insistent on us moving over to an actual table when our party grew. Off of the pub fare menu, the big juicy steak, generous steak sandwich, and English style fish and chips were all reported to be simply scrumptious.

The decor is put together with a casual vibe. The minimalism of the white walls are accented by the single exposed brick wall. The row of hanging lamps overhead provide dim lighting that sets the mood. The windows that wrap all the way around from Victoria to Lombard St. makes you, the happy diner, the window display for the few pedestrians that walk by. Smile! You're a live advertisement."}
{"text":"The host at the front was not friendly or welcoming, but the bartenders were. We were offered a complimentary deep fried chicken skin, which was a nice touch. The beers are beer, $6/pint including tax (a great deal). We left after one pint because it's a bit too bright inside and the music was all terrible modern rock (not a good fit for Parkdale). Would go back if they had better music and a more welcoming host."}
{"text":"we went yesterday, the friday before the week of christmas. no reservation, big mistake! but we left our phone number and they called and held our table for 20 minutes while we trundled back. that was really nice!

sort of downhill from there. the beers are good, but the food is dumb expensive for the quality. we had the curry poutine because the duck confit poutine was out. the curry poutine tastes like generic curry powder mixed with fries and some cheese. not interesting! it's the same taste as any other british curry. boring. just because you can put curry powder with any food, doesn't mean you should. i want poutine!

my friend got the heirloom tomato salad. really, it was greens and a few tomatoes. far too few for the price. i suspect because the day was so busy they were rationing the tomatoes! !

you can do better, duggan's."}
{"text":"NEVER book this place for a large event or gathering if you expect to have any communication with them at all. 

Back in December of 2016, I reached out to book this venue for my wedding reception to be held in September of 2017. It took a month of us pestering them before we were able to sit down, talk details, and pay a deposit. We gave them a pass on their initial slow response rate because Christmas is a busy season and we were excited at the prospect of having our reception here. 

Fast forward to June 2017, when we were told to contact them about confirming the details of our wedding. After several unanswered e-mails and phone calls spanning three weeks, we showed up in person expecting a reasonable answer as to why they decided to ghost us and completely ignore us for a month. Unfortunately a new employee had to deal with us, as the owner Michael was either to cowardly to face us in person, or couldn't care less about our business (after we already paid them $800). 

We eventually got our money back after threatening to report them to the Better Business Bureau, but the owner has still not acknowledged us, or the fact that he screwed us out of a venue and wasted months of our time. Now we're left finding a new venue less than 3 months away from our wedding date, and Duggan's probably couldn't care less that they've put us in this position. 

They don't even deserve the one star I've given, and I don't feel even close to being compensated for the time of ours they wasted."}
{"text":"A gem of a pub boasting all aspects of a great local expertly nailed: chill vibe, space for groups of all sizes, a great beer selection, and good food--and the game is playing if you're interested. 

With beer as its specialty, Duggan's has a list that covers the gamut but isn't so long and crazy that you're overwhelmed. Anyone can find something they like, and there are tasters you can try. Food is similarly curated - it's not a huge menu but there's enough diversity in food type to suit everyone's palates and dietary needs. I've never been more impressed by a kale salad - anywhere - which is pretty impressive for a pub. They use dark meat and throw in beets and cabbage and it all comes out delicious. Other knockouts include their polenta fries, which are crispy, salty and amazing, wings, etc. 

Staff are always friendly and relaxed. They have a trivia night that is also a lot of fun. You get the sense that it's a good group behind the bar. The ambiance as mentioned before is very relaxed and dark like all pubs should be, but they still have modern fixtures, and nice, clean, single-stall bathrooms. And while a sports bar it isn't, there are enough TVs around to make it possible to invite people out to watch the game and grab a drink. Finally, prices are reasonable. Go check it out okay!!!!!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 as a place to grab a couple of beer, based on one visit.  Had their #5 (Sorachi Lager) which went down nice and easy... maybe cause its only 4%.  Lots of space which is nothing to be sneezed in (or very near) the financial core.  No problems with service."}
{"text":"It's hard to pinpoint the favourite part of my last visit here.  It's a toss up between when our waiter shouted accusatorily \"it's women like you that made me this way\" to Sarah L, and the moment he decided to start blaming me, personally, for every wrong thing that happened ever.

Not only did he insinuate that it was my fault that my (underwhelming) order of spetzle was late because it was sent to the wrong printer, he was also happy to mention that it was also my fault that he blew nearly $700 over the previous two nights getting drunk at Byzantium and various other after-hours clubs, and further, that I was responsible for the fact the he got spit on after slapping a girl in a club, that slapped him first, for refusing to sell her cocaine.  

Not sure about the service here.  

My meal was so-so. Sarah L. seemed to enjoy hers, and Mike S.'s schnitzel was massive. (Insert your own joke here, I'm too lazy.)

Obligatory Title Pun: Just DUGGAN a hole for yourself.

Menu Readability: Clean and tasteful layout, but could use a better typeface.

Need to mention: This waiter was batshit crazy; I've had reasonable experiences here.

What this place teaches me about myself: It's all my fault."}
{"text":"I cannot say in all honesty that this place continues to merit the original four star review that I accorded it over a year ago when it first opened. The early days of Duggan's were a period of excitement and hope for what was to come, but sadly they've fallen short.

Inconsistent service, often unprofessional and careless, and prices that are far too ambitious for what is being delivered. To make matters worse, management seems disorganized and completely unfazed by their feedback. I shan't return nor recommend that anyone looking for a guaranteed good time do so either. You can get Duggan's beer at a variety of places in Toronto that have a much better atmosphere and consistent service."}
{"text":"I popped in for brunch on Sunday, but instead of eggs, I opted for jerk chicken wings and caesar salad. It was all straight forward pub food, but the super service and local beer list make this brut a special place. 

Parkdale has many cozy little spots that are loved. Being so loved, they often fill up fast. Duggan's is a palatial space, so if you're ever within a few blocks and hungering for a snack and a beer, I recommend beelining for Duggan's... they'll get you sorted."}
