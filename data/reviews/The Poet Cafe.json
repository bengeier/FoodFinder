{"text":"So both times I came on a Saturday before their closing time and they were closed. What about an update on their social media or something to indicate customers that they will be closing early. So frustrating to make all of my way both times (I live outside of Toronto) and both times they are packing up earlier than usual."}
{"text":"Terrible coffee that they try to make up for with nice decor. The baristas here have no clue how to make a proper cappuccino. What I got was a watery mess, with zero foam, basically just espresso and warm milk. It was terrible and cost about 20% more than any other coffee shop in Toronto ($4.50 for a cappuccino). Definitely never coming back here."}
{"text":"It is quick, simple and delicious. Wow- favorite brunch upto now. The coffee was fresh and has a very nice aroma. Loved it. Next it came with six side dishes with different flavor and bread. Out of these six, rosemary jam, cream cheese with herbs and beef slices with mozzarella was awesome. Then the main dish which was omelette with beef sausage, it was yummy. All in all, my favorite brunch in downtown Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Additional stars deducted for business disorganization. 

I had made a reservation for two for Saturday brunch at 10:30. I got a call from them at 9:30 for what I thought would be a confirmation, but they said \"I know you asked if you can come in earlier and you can\". I was confused but I politely said \"no that wasn't me I'll see you at 10:30\". 

My friend got there before me and asked what name the reservation was made under. Turns out he tried my name and they had no record of the reservation. So some time between 9:30 and 10:30, my reservation got lost. This luckily wasn't an issue for us as they had space available, but if I had gone with a larger party I might have been SOL. 

The food itself was also nothing special. My friend (who is Persian) said that the Persian chai latte was a mix of two different drinks. I had some form of eggs Benedict but it was with thinly sliced Persian cured meat. I was surprised that they only gave one piece on the benny- two would have yielded better flavour. 

I've satisfied my curiosity and wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"It's one the hidden gems in the King East. Good spot to hang out with friends over a coffee."}
{"text":"The worst business and most unprofessional business owner I've ever come across. As someone who has been in the industry for a while, I've never been treated in such a sleazy and heartless way. 

Amir and Mosi won't just not pay you for the hours you've worked but they will make you mad from trying to track them down. They will create their own tax deductions on your handwritten \"pay stub\" even though they want to pay you in cash. They will decrease your mutually agreed upon hourly wage on you simply because you've \"pissed them off\" and they will choose to pay you for only the hours they feel like paying you for regardless of how long you actually worked. 

Please be wary if you want to work here. All they care about is money and they will not think twice if you are a student with tuition and rent to pay. These men should not be running a business and really need a check in with employment standards and Canadian law. I have yet to get the money for the hours I worked from them."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe on Queen East that does fancy coffee and light snacks. I had a fancy latte and a persian kalba sandwich. The sandwich was nicely spiced and delicious. The latte was pretty decent as well. 

Service and decor were good as well."}
{"text":"beautiful place. unbelievable quality! amazing service!
thanks so much! keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee and fell in love with this place. Great vibe, funky decor and the best coffee I've had."}
{"text":"Literally the best hot chocolate I have ever had!! Havent tried the food but the decor is fabulous"}
{"text":"I went for a brunch in a weekend and it seems that the menu in the weekend is different than weekdays. The place is nicely decorated, cosy and neat (rating 5). The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and professional (rating 5). The food menu includes a choice of baked omelette that is small but comes with 6 small bowls of: honey cream, feta walnut, apricot jam, olives, cold cut beef, cucumber and tomatoes. Food is yummy but nothing extraordinary, pita bread made in the oven and is really good (rating 5). Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food because we never even came close to getting seated properly. Advice for others seeking weekend brunch here- make a reservation or else be prepared to wait an eternity. Friend and I came at 12 noon today (Saturday) and tbh it wasn't super busy inside, but I guess they were short staff since we were left to wait by the door for almost 30 mins before we became too hungry and made an executive decision to leave. Two people who came in after us left after being told the wait was going to be at least 40 mins. Funny thing is that for the longest time my friend and I were the only two people waiting \"in line\". 

Better luck next time, hopefully they're fast"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the vibes . It is kind of traditional modern. Besides they are nice and very welcoming."}
{"text":"Loved hanging out here today - the art and design was refreshing and beautifully done! This place has a variety of seating - great for meeting up with a friend or bringing your laptop to get some work done while you enjoy a latte. Found this gem to be full of life in a vibrant, cozy kind of way."}
{"text":"Their brunch indeed wowed me. It's a tray of all you could ask for. It is stylish and the attention to details is impeccable."}
{"text":"We serendipitously stumbled upon this Tehran-inspired cafe while strolling around downtown Toronto.  The clean and modern decor was what caused us to pause and review the menu. After all, first impressions matter!  However, The Poet Cafe is more than just a pretty cafe.  Each time we came here for breakfast, the coffee and our sandwiches were made with a lot of care.  We're talking so much care that the sandwiches came wrapped and tied with a bow.  

Their coffee beans are sourced from Pilot Coffee Roasters, and the lattes we had were smooth and slightly fruity.  The first time, I had the Egg & Cheese Sandwich which was made up of pita bread, egg, labneh, feta,  and walnut herb spread.  It was delicious and made for a good snack.  The second time, I had the Omelette Sandwich that consisted of pita bread, *two* eggs, beef sausage, and mozzarella.  The sausage can be substituted for Persian mortadella if you so choose.

If I were a local, I would definitely camp out here to get some work done.  The ambiance is quiet, Wi-Fi is reliable, and there is all the complimentary watermelon and cucumber infused water you can drink."}
{"text":"Came here for their Turk Khavesi..which was sold out---how can anyone be sold out of their main drink that escapes me---ordered an Americano which was extremely watered down..guess I am holding them to the standard of All mighty Dark Horse's Americano---this Americano was watered dowwwwwn.....

They have a Persian vibe at this place with writings on the wall the menu reflecting middle eastern items...but with that said I have never seen confused Caucasians behind the counter who have no Idea what they are serving or what is in the food being displayed on the shelves...

So disappointed!"}
{"text":"A combination Turkish, Lebanese and Persian cafe, which was unfortunately out of Turkish coffee for the day. Tried a cortado; was nutty and medium-bodied, nicely balanced. Will definitely head back to try the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"3.7/5 Would be a full 4 if the food came faster. My friend and I waited 35 minutes before our food arrived and hers was already lukewarm. I ordered the white moon which was quite good but it was a tad on the oily end. The bread and salad were a nice touch as well. What I like was the cute decor and the presentation of the food. You can also make reservations on opentable which is recommended as there aren't many tables available."}
{"text":"First time to the poet cafe. I heard that they do a great sandwich during the week and recently added Sunday brunch so I decided to try it out for brunch.
The deco was very nice. Not a big place but not too busy probably because they just started having Sunday brunch. For brunch it is a fixed menu, 6 little starters and choice of eggs also including tea or coffee. 
There are different kind of omelettes and egg styles to choose from but it is the starters that are the most amazing. 
Comes with hot pita bread, Persian garden salad, walnut feta yogurt ball, rose jam, honey and butter, olives, cold cuts and pickles. 
I was quite full after the starters already. I didn't need the Persian sausage omelette I ordered. I heard that you can just have the starter without the eggs too. That's what I will do next time. 
Definitely worth it for brunch and I will go back and also try the sandwiches for lunch too."}
{"text":"The Poet Cafe is a Persian inspired cafe serving up Pilot Coffee as well as various breakfast, lunch, and pastry options. Located near Jarvis and King, this quiet cafe is a great addition the the neighbourhood.

I stopped by The Poet Cafe on a Saturday morning and was surprised at the beautiful decor and warm atmosphere that the interior created. The communal table at the front of the cafe was definitely a beautiful highlight as well as the various details on the walls and floor that made the place aesthetically pleasing (and Instagram worthy!). I walked up to the counter and was greeted by friendly smiling employees. Being told that they were also serving breakfast, I opted for an Americano as well as an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. After ordering I found myself a spot to wait for my food and drink to arrive (staff said that they would bring me my items). 

I got my Americano fairly quickly but it seems like the kitchen had a bit of a mix up and I had to wait a while for my egg and cheese sandwich. I wasn't in a rush and was spending some time alone so it didn't bother me that much. The staff were friendly and apologized for the mistake and also treated me to a free pastry (I'm not exactly sure what it's called but there were nuts in it and it was good!). When my sandwich came it was fresh and hot and the flavours were really unique. The spices they used together and the pita bread was certainly good. A different take on an egg and cheese sandwich. The americano I had was great as well, they certainly know how to make a good cup of coffee! 

Overall, except for the food mix up, the cafe delivers. It is a friendly and warm place you could spend a few hours working or have a quick bite to eat. They have a more extensive brunch menu on Sunday which looks amazing as well! Great place to check out if you are ever around the area."}
{"text":"I personally prefer their Sunday brunch to Saturday as it's different and offers greater variety through their various small sides. That said, I got the date omelette on Saturday, which I enjoyed as well. Keep in mind, it is quite sweet and date-heavy, so if you don't like dates, I suggest steer clear!"}
{"text":"The Persian burger was so good that I've to come write a 5 start review about it! 

Although it was a coffee shop, the menu serve middle eastern inspired drinks and hot sandwich! Delicious hot sandwich! 

I had this Pink colour cold drinks(first thing on the menu)  that has great Rose, saffron, mint and lime scent! Really authentic and perfect mix! If you are not a coffee drinker, this is not your regular depressing unflavoured ice tea...it's magical! 

The burger...oh wow! How do I begin? Hot juicy burger patty spiced nicely with layered of different secret sauces. Plus sth like yogurt and cheese in it plus pickle to refresh up! I almost want to order two but I didn't want to scare my friend... 

Can't wait to come back! And student with card get discount!"}
