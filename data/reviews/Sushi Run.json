{"text":"Great food - great price - great service! Very friendly place for kids too  I was diving around, looking for a place to have lunch and found this place and I LOVE IT! This will be my go to sushi place from now on"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and severs~ Me and my husband go there all the time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a really nice sushi place! Family run- the mom is super cute and friendly! First time here, had the sushi lover and a bento box. Proportions were good, the price is fair for sushi. There's another place next door called Gojima that seems to always be busy, but I would honestly come back here for the SERVICE and quality. Good service is always a big thing for me and the staff here are super nice."}
{"text":"I've been a regular takeout customer for about 2 years now, and the place is still great even after the change in ownership.  All the employees (not 'just' the waitress) are super nice and interactive, and I feel that they have an even more positive and friendly environment since it changed.  I appreciate both the spacious booths as well as the small tables for when I have the time to dine in by myself.  We also had a small birthday get-together in a group of 10 people, and the waitress' service was still on point. I look forward to my next take out!"}
{"text":"I live down the block from this sushi place when I went for the first time for my take out order the staff was very very friendly my sushi was delicious I went back for the second time and also got the same great service and food definitely Recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place a month ago and we continued to go back. We love this spot! Fresh food for a reasonable price. Sashimi is amazing and sushi rolls are very well done and tasty. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am definitely a big fan of this place for 3 reasons!  1. It's in the UberEats app (yay for hungry office workers) 2. They don't pack on the rice and presentation is always great 3. Price is quite competitive compared to others on the app.  I'd recommend this place. My absolute favs from this place is the spicy crab roll and dynamite roll. I also appreciate the complimentary noodles they give with delivery orders. Not sure if they do that in the restaurant too."}
{"text":"I thought the food was fantastic.  Very original and staff were very friendly.  I loved the sushi burrito. I am craving one right now.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for something original and not the same old rolls."}
{"text":"This is the best place to have sushi in the area! Fish is so fresh and the service is impeccable everytime I come. The owner is such a delight and all the servers here are one of a kind! I have been living in the area for over 8 years and this is the only place I will eat sushi. I love Sushi Run!"}
{"text":"Does this world need another good sushi restaurant? If you live in Etobicoke where pickings are a bit slimmer than, let's say, downtown, North York, and pretty much anywhere else in the GTA, then the answer is 'yes'.  Sushi Run took over for Sushi2Go about 5 months ago according to the owner. Not sure what the previous joint was like but the food that I ordered was good if not one of the better non-Japanese sushi I have had. I ordered one big sushi sashimi combo and one small. The food came with extras such as miso, kimchi, etc. Pretty good value and friendly service, I have no reservations about recommending this place. I would have to try more dishes to properly gauge how it standa up to the great sushi restaurants, but so far so good."}
{"text":"I just visited for the first time and was really impressed with the friendly staff and amazing service! Me and my friends got a private booth in the back which was really cozy and comfortable.   My friends ordered a sushi burger (which they said was amazing), a sushi burrito, agadashi tofu and a couple rolls. I had a combo of sushi and sashimi which I really liked although I wasn't the biggest fan of the sauce and mayo on my dynamite rolls. Would definitely order again but would ask them to hold the sauce.   At the end of the meal the owner's daughter came to ask us how our meal was and to say thank you for coming! Overall, I was really impressed and would come back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I both wanted to try a new place, so we grabbed our phones and found Sushi Run.   We can't say enough great things about this place, the service was outstanding, and the food exceeded our expectations.   We have gotten used to going to the same place close to work downtown, but have promised ourselves to try new places. That's how we wound up on Bloor St.  We were greeted right away by a very friendly server, and she cleared a cozy booth room for us, which was really nice.  Our drink order was taken right away, and the menu was very extensive which was a nice surprise, everything looked and sounded delicious.   We started with the \"Chicken Karaage $6.99 (Fried Japanese chicken with a side of spicy mayo)\" It arrived very quickly, was hot, and delicious! We also tried the \"Sweet Potato Crispers $3.99 (Sweet potato, onions deep fried served with tempura sauce) Um, make sure you order this, we were both scrambling over who got the next bite. Great combo with the onion.  We debated back and forth, over what to order next, and chose the sashimi appetizer, the \"Kalbi - $17.99 - Grilled Korean BBQ ribs marinated in a sweet soya sauce served on a sizzling hot plate\", and the \"Fire Dragon Roll $12.99 (Shrimp tempura, avocado, crab meat, cucumber, tobiko topped with seared salmon, spicy mayo, mayo, unagi sauce, siracha & tobiko).   When we ordered the ribs, our server mentioned that those were her favorite, and we would have to say that they were our favorite as well. BEST dish we have had out in a long time, outstanding in fact! There wasn't a speck of anything left behind on that hot plate!   I basically picked the ribs and by other half picked the roll, and the roll far exceeded my expectations. Best roll we have ever had, and we love our sushi ;)  Sashimi was good, but everything else was just so scrumptious that it over shadowed the fish. I wasn't about to downgrade the rating though because the food was amazing, service ...best we have ever had, so good that when my husband dropped his chopstick, the waitress popped her head in with fresh ones for him, how she knew, when we were tucked in that room I don't know, but she rocked! She even brought us lovely tea...  Go for the amazing food, grab one of the little cozy rooms, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews were deceivingly good! The staff is very friendly but the sushi is mediocre and put together in a sloppy matter. I was quite disappointed as I was very excited to eat good sushi."}
{"text":"I ordered a dynamite dragon burrito from here, it was really good! Very filling and was made really well, didn't fall apart like I thought it may have. Would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"This was the best sushi my husband and I have ever had, and we frequent a lot of sushi restaurants. It's not all you can eat, but the dishes are plentiful and the prices are fair especially for the quality. We got appetizers and sushi/maki and everything we ordered was sooo delicious. Got a few items complimentary as well. The service was superb, even the chefs said hello and thanked us when we were leaving. Super welcoming, excellent food, and great price. 10/10 our new sushi go to."}
{"text":"I love living in Etobicoke! New to the area, my SO and I have been trying out different places in the area and was recommend to come to Sushi Run to try out some sushi! We were in a bit of a rush so just ordered take out rather than eating in.  Their menu was vast so it took us some time to figure out what we wanted but settled on the spicy aburi sushi, assorted sashimi, and a lobster king roll. The fish was fresh and the rice to fish portioning was perfect for the Maki sushi. Overall, all of the food was  super delicious and the service was top notch! The food definitely satisfied our cravings for Japanese food and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the hood and turned to yelp for sushi recommendations and this place had great reviews. As someone who is new to Toronto winters, I made the mistake of walking 15 minutes to get here in -15 but was warmed up inside and promptly given tea. I ordered box C for take away and the sushi was delicious (especially the spicy sashimi roll) the take away packaging was great (no spills, soup stayed warm) and one of the women even came to help me bundle up for my walk back. I will definitely go back (just might have to bundle up better or take an uber )."}
{"text":"Excellent! My wife and I stopped in for a meal of sushi burrito for her, and some kind of vegetarian roll for me. Warning: they consider shrimp as vegetarian so read the menu well, but the food we ordered was impeccable. If you're in the area and looking for some tasty fresh food, stop in for a bite!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately for my co-workers I'm being extremely strict about the foods I do and do not eat while we are here in Toronto for business. However, sick of salad and searching for something tasty I came across Sushi Run on yelp. Impressed with the rating we decided to come here for lunch.   I was very pleased with the service, the decor, we noted the private booths which were full at the time. The servers were extremely nice and almost immediately brought tea to the table. I was happy to see large mugs of tea rather than the small dip bowls common at home.  The food was great, my order of miso soup came with a tasting of the crystal noodles offered. I believe they are made from sweet potatoes, other than the slight hue from the potatoes they are generally clear. They were great, I'll consider ordering them on my next visit. (We are here for two weeks), the miso soup was great as well.  Shortly after my order came out, the spicy crunchy salmon roll and two pieces of salmon sushi. Both were fresh and excellent. The presentation was great. This definitely beat out our sushi place (nearby our office) back home. The speed of the restaurant was great, we had ample space and weren't overpowered with any conversations taking place. I make this note as Sushi Run is in a strip of businesses and quite narrow.   The moral of the story is I was quite pleased with my visit and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Will definitely give 5 stars to this place! The food was amazing and the service was excellent. Their complimentary salad was the best. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great food! Had a sushi taco for the first time and it was delicious. Girlfriend had the chef's chirashi and it was very fresh and nicely presented. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, and the sushi burritos are a must try!"}
{"text":"This place was okay at best. Sever forgot my watet.....twice.  The sushi is cheap and it was really busy when I got here. They had a lot of take out orders as well. As for the actual food it was mediocre at best. The pieces were big and we had some roll that had some weird mayo sauce on it which did not make it good whatsoever. When it comes to Sushi I know by now that the cheaper you pay the less quality you receieve which makes sense I guess. Anyways, come here if you what some quick and cheap sushi eats."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. Super friendly staff, imaginative sushi and general good quality. Very pleasantly surprised, and a good value. Recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, however, unfortunately for us, we weren't sure what they meant by 'hand rolled', and was surprised to see two large burrito-looking sushi rolls. They tasted great, though a little difficult to eat. Will be sure to know for certain what we're ordering next time, so as to avoid slight disappointment."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot! So happy that they're open again! Had the chicken Don buri at lunch today and my gosh, it was amazing. Not to me room I got a soup and salad with the lunch special and just paid a little over ten dollars. Great prices, innovative dishes, and stellar service. Will be taking all my business here!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I've come/ordered frequently since they opened. The food is always excellent and fast at a reasonable price. I normally only get rolls and miso soup and both are delicious :)But I  ordered a tempura  bento for the first time last week and was pleasantly surprised at how well everything was packaged (no soggy breading=win!)"}
{"text":"Such a cute place. Ran in at around 7pm on a Wednesday for some takeout and the staff were so friendly and really nice. They told me to have a seat at a table by the door while I waited and brought me tea and an appetizer. The sushi (I got a veggie green dragon roll & yasi roll) was fresh and really good. I would definitely re-visit and totally recommend visiting here :)"}
{"text":"Great attention from staff, really good variety  of sushi, very welcoming place. My friend thought the waitress knew me, but they didn't. :)"}
{"text":"Sushi was very good....next time ill ask for no mayo on my rolls but loved it otherwise!"}
{"text":"I just love the chicken teriyaki bento and the miso soup. I will always have my lunch here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It is rare to find a Japanese restaurant that has really good service and really good food and Sushi Run definitely has both. The servers and chefs are super nice and hospital and the food is really good. During the first few times I've visited Sushi Run, I received gifts of decorative chopsticks and complimentary hor d'uvres. Sushi Run is definitely my go to lunch spot and I am looking forward to trying out more of their lunch items."}
{"text":"This place has become my go-to sushi spot! I LOVE their sushi, the quality, their service and the place itself is so cute! It has a little sushi bar and cute little booths. The servers are very friendly and the food, I don't even know where to begin! The sushi is a good size, very fresh, and very very delicious. it may seem a little pricey but their menu carries a variety.                                             Overall, 10/10 would recomend!"}
{"text":"I've ordered 3 rolls and several appetizers, the server bring me wrong roll and refuse to change. Again I Am ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SURE what I ordered. Besides the terrible service everything else is good and they have the booth which is good as well."}
{"text":"What a nice sushi place! One of my favorite sushi restaurants actually. The food was really good, the employees were so friendly, helpful and nice. This is definitely a place were I will come back again... and again. I love that they have the option for private booth, as well, which makes this place even more friendly and puts it higher on my list. The food is mostly Korean, portions are generous and you are usually rewarded for a Yelp check-in with a small appetizer."}
{"text":"Huge sushi guy and Sushi Run lives up to its 5 star rating.  Ordered through uber eats, received in perfect presentation.   Would highly recommend.  Combo G (Tuna) was delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favourite hang outs for sushi when I'm sick of ayce. Everyone here makes you feel like you are a very welcomed guest or even family and the quality of the sushi is top notch!   Make sure to try the beef gyoza"}
{"text":"Wonderful locals only place.  It's about community and good sushi.   Try the bogolgi and ginger ice cream."}
{"text":"I think this place was previously called \"Sushi 2 Go\" and it is now under new management. We just ordered a beautiful platter for Family Day, and they were open and glad to help us. We ordered the 60 piece sushi platter, and without a problem, we replaced one of the rolls with our favourite Green Dragon Roll. They offered us free delivery, had us pay over the phone, which was much easier for us since we didnt need the machine at the door. They brought us 2 large miso soups and a bowl of glass noodles on the house! The food was really fresh, and very delicious. Also came with different sashimi pieces, which were also fresh and tasty. Great place and good prices!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Run is fresh and delicious. They have fast, friendly service.   I recommend opting for a platter. This way you get a bit more variety. The platters consist primarily of various sushi rolls. The rolls are flavourful, fresh and wrapped perfectly. The miso soup is also delicious.  Lunch on weekends is less crowded.  Street parking is available in front of the shop, yet it is also close to the TTC.  Check in on Yelp to get free edamame with your order."}
{"text":"Such a great place. We went twice actually because of the incredible quality of sushi, sashimi, etc.   The location is so groovy inside. They have small rooms to dine in which makes everything super intimate and really enhances the experience.   They have some excellent platter combos for great prices. They're not harsh about substitutions either which is so relieving.   Had lots of appetisers which all tested delicious - especially the seaweed salad.   The service was also excellent. Never too long to wait for anything or too overbearing, just right!  Definitely retuning when I'm back in Toronto next time!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best for miles! Exactly like the other reviews said - friendly, great quality and price. Don't waste your time going anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded to 4   This place is really cute. It has a sushi bar and some tables. We actually sat in a cute little booth that was fairly private-- it was almost like our own little room!   The miso soup was delicious and I loved the side of noodles they brought with it. New favorite!   The sushi was pretty good. The sashimi was fantastic -- very fresh and my personal favorite and my boyfriends (both salmon and tuna).   I have to admit that the rice was not the greatest. It wasn't packed together super well, so it was like tasting every grain. In addition, it was on the firmer side. The salmon sushi was also slightly on the smaller side.   The service was fantastic, fast and friendly. They finished the service with a delicious orange, which I thought was a nice touch.   All in all, I'll come back here. I think this place has potential, and I would love to come back and give it more stars. They have a pretty extensive menu, with lots of options for combo platters; as well as your typical ice cream flavors and fried banana dishes for dessert."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night to pick up my take-out order. There were not too many diners but they seemed busy with other take-out orders. I don't think I'd want to dine in as it's a small narrow restaurant with little room to move around.  Anyway, the fish was fresh but the rolls were extremely small and the sushi was cut very thin. I actually had some soup about two hours later as I had gotten hungry.  In my opinion, there are better sushi restaurants in South Etobicoke so I wouldn't necessarily rush to come back."}
{"text":"Omggggg so amazing I'm writing this as I sit here! Everything is fresh and the service is perfect!!!! I'm a big foodie and huge on service in restaurants. It's so important! I've been to literally hundreds of sushi places and this is right at the top."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the helpful staff and choice of food they had. The place has these Japanese style cabins you can sit and eat in which make the experience very exotic.  The food did take 35 min to arrive."}
{"text":"What a nice sushi place! One of my favorite sushi restaurants actually. The food was really good, and the employees were so friendly, helpful and nice. This is definitely a place were I would come back again... and again. I love that they have the option for private booth, really lovely atmosphere. The rolls were really delicious, not too much rice (which is a good sign), and they offered us very tasty glass noodles (sweet potato noodles). I highly recommend this place: great prices, plenty of options, including many vegan dishes and rolls."}
{"text":"Pros: High quality food for good price  Cons: - Pretty small restaurant, not great for large groups.  (Over 10 will be next to impossible) - only steet parking   Went here for dinner with 8 people.  We made reservations which ended up a good thing as the whole restaurant likely can seat about 30 people.  Atmosphere: (3.5 stars) The restaurant is def not fancy, and more a take out place.   They connected 4 tables to seat us 8, with only a few tables left in the place for other customers.    They do have a few private booths which looked cool ( Japanese style walls around them), but they can fit max 4 people.    Service: (4 stars) The weitress was friend and politely but nothing extra.  When asked she did note that tip was not included in the bill.  (Props to that)  Food: (5 stars) We got 4 miso soup(5 stars).  2$ each, standard AYCE size. 2 orders of spring rolls (4 stars) pretty small, and good.  Nothing special.  We got 2 orders of beef gyoza with the Yelp promo (5 stars). Crispy and the meat had delicious spices in it.   Sushi pizza (5 stars) - I had it a few times before at all you can eat places and it was horrible.  However, here I found it delicious.   It was on the expensive side compared to other apterizes.  $9  Party size sashimi (5+ stars), sushi and maki plater (see pictures).  It was fantastic.  Really large pieces of sashimi.   With the above we were all full, and suprized that the bill came so cheap compared to AYCE.   (It was 240 with tax before tip for 8 people with 4 beers, and 3 drinks.)  Will def come here again over AYCE if there are more than 4 people."}
{"text":"Probably The Friendliest Service that I have received...up to this date!  And I just read the \"Our Story\" portion of their website and it's actually pretty interesting, so check it out.  Parking:  1-2 dedicated spots around the back of the building.  Otherwise, it's Green P OR residential parking a coupla streets down, so don't really worry about it!  I was gonna try out one of their items on their \"Trending Sushi\" page of the menu, in particular their Poké bowls, but decided against it.  It's a few dollars more expensive than Corner as you have to pay an extra $5 to include rice/soup/salad, so I opted to go the more traditional route to check out how their sushi.  Sushi was pretty good, more of a fusion style that caters to the area as opposed to authentic flavours.  Spicy Salmon had a lot of fried bits and sauce on top as did the Dynamite Roll.  Not great as a Day-After snack.  :)  Then again, I'm not someone who likes all that stuff on top, but it was still good.  What stood out over the sushi was the Korean food like Spicy Chicken and clear noodles that came as an app.  There was definitely more than just chicken + gochujang going on!  Check this friendly place out if you're in the area and you're up for a Sushi Run.    Free gyozas with any check-in!  Just show the server.  Free wifi as well.  They also have delivery within the area."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Can't get enough of it! I highly recommend coming here. The sushi is always fresh and so delicious!"}
{"text":"Update:  This place is STILL amazing and it is still my favorite place! I've become a regular here"}
{"text":"Great little gem! The owner Annie is very friendly as well as all her staff! Recommend: double salmon roll, pink lady, crispy spicy salmon roll, volcano, and their shrimp tempura and chicken tempura."}
{"text":"The ratings of Sushi Run are very high and I can understand why.  The family that runs Sushi Run is adorably wonderful.  When we arrived, the owner and her family was there doing everything... all with a beaming smile.  I wouldn't think a normal person would have that type of infectious smile but here she was, at work and greeting everyone the same way.   This place is best described as your neighbourhood spot.  Sushi Run is a petite place that is more homey than your normal spot.  It has 2 cute little wooden rooms to one side of the narrow space but there are more than enough tables for at least 30 people.   I will say they do a crazy amount of take out... I think when we walked in, there was 4 platters and 2 bags ready to be picked up and this continued throughout the time we were there.    Service is the best part of this place... just infectiously happy and sincere in every way possible.  Not only did they greet us happily the moment we stepped into the place but also they checked in multiple times to make sure we have everything we needed and helped clear the plates.  One cute thing was that the owner create these tiny little extra gifts for every table... a sauce container filled with chocolate eggs for Easter.  Completely unnecessary but adorably thoughtful.  Small things do make a difference.  As for the menu, it's quite large with a number of special rolls.  My suggestion is to grab a platter if you can... it's not only a large variety, it's a good value.  For 5 people, the large maki, sushi, and sashimi platter with 3 appetizers was more than enough food.  We barely finished.   I do appreciate the thoughtful amuse bouche of chilled sweet potato noodles in a sesame soya sauce.    Beef Gyoza - This was a yelp check in gift.  I would say these are run of the mill beef gyoza.  Fried a bit but could have been a bit more as it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it.  The sauce helped to kick up the flavour.   3.5/5  Agedashi Tofu - Large pieces of silken tofu but the coating wasn't as crispy as I've had at other places.  3.5/5  Spicy Sushi Pizza - This was good.  Super crispy base topped with chopped spicy salmon, avocado, and tobiko.  It was served super fresh just out of the fryer.  You have creamy, crunchy, spicy, and salty... all in a delicious bite.  Definitely a winner for apps. 4/5  Sushi, Sashimi, and Maki roll platter - Large variety and nothing seemed skimped on.  All of the sashimi and sushi pieces were cut in a good size.   Maki rolls all done nicely, clean smooth rolls with lots of filling, and nice flavours.  Spicy mayo just makes everything great lol.  I didnt find they used too much rice as filler so this was good too.  4/5  Another nice last thoughtful touch was that they gave the birthday girl a HUGE helping of 2 large ice cream scoops to help celebrate her day.  She loved it.  Again... small gestures can make a big difference.  She loves Japanese food now.    You can't help but love the place because of the people here.  Genuine happy service like this is not common.  When it's coupled with good food and very reasonable prices, it's a no brainer when you're deciding a local neighbourhood spot for dinner."}
{"text":"After reading reviews, looking through photos, and many cravings later....I FINALLY visited this place!  I absolutely loved it!  Came here on a Friday evening around 6 before the dinner rush and was glad I did.  This place is quite small but they do have lots of tables and booths to accommodate the hungry sushi lovers, but when you're an amazing sushi restaurant with great service, expect it to be busy!  The moment I checked in you get a choice of a free ice cream, gyoza, or edamame.  I obviously chose the gyoza!  The sushi was amazing, very fresh and super flavourful.    My boyfriend and I got the Volcano roll, Black Dragon roll, Spider roll,Salmon Tataki, Butterfish sashimi, and eel sashimi.  My first bite of food I cried (in a good way) they were all so delicious! No Complaints.  My favourites:  Salmon Tataki and the Volcano Roll! They just had so much flavour.  Every bite was just as orgasmic as the next....too bad I had to share lol."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Run.   I have never met a friendlier owner and of course the sushi is fantastic!   Love it every time."}
{"text":"Amazing Food Experience and Amazing Customer Service!!!  I came across the restaurant based on Yelp review to celebrate my cousin's birthday. The staffs were extremely friendly and helpful. Note that Sushi Run offers very typical sushi dishes like The Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, Raw Salmon, ... Along with some Korean dishes like Kalbi. Nothing much special about the menu but what suprise me is their execellent taste along with nicely dish decoration. At the end, the restaurant suprised my family with Free Icecream for my cousin's bday. The favors are exotic: Ginger, matcha, red bean, black seasame.   Btw, price very reasonable. I would say less than $20/ person. I highly recommend everyone to give Sushi Run a try and you will be in love as much as I do *repeat: Best Customer Service i've ever been!"}
{"text":"Before I start, let me say that I reeeeally wanted to like this place - after reading the reviews and looking at the pictures (and menu!), I was super excited and wanted to go here right away - unfortunately I was let down, and though I do want to give this place the benefit of the doubt, I just couldn't see what everyone was raving about. The waitresses we had were nice, and we were seating in a booth right away, which I really appreciated. As I was going through the menu, I remembered looking it up online before and being really excited that there was vegetarian gyoza, as it's almost impossible to find literally anywhere. So I ordered that + two other rolls, and the person I was with ordered the dinner bento box with tofu teriyaki. When the gyoza came out first, I was super excited, but after eating half of one, I noticed that it tasted like chicken.   Now look - I'm not a picky vegetarian by any means. I don't really care if meat/veggies are on the same grill, I don't care when my friends eat meat - I just don't like to eat meat myself. After 4 years of being a vegetarian though, I know EXACTLY what meat tastes like because of how many times I've eaten something and immediately my mouth has been like \"um... what's this?\" So last night I took a bite and my mouth tasted it, and I looked inside and noticed tiny chicken bits. I then made the person I was with (who does eat meat) have a bite as well to make sure I wasn't totally crazy, and he was like \"Oh yeah that's definitely chicken\". It wasn't a huge deal for me, I just put what I chewed in my napkin and told the waitress. But then the waitress took the plate back to the kitchen, then came back with the same plate and told me that it actually was vegetarian and there was no chicken, and that what I was tasting was the cabbage (???? I guess as a vegetarian I don't know what cabbage tastes like? Not sure). At this point I thought maybe it was just the one I ate, and not all of them, so I took a bite into another one only to find - surprise! - more chicken. At this point I wasn't going to argue again, since they obviously didn't believe me and the chicken was hard to see (since it only seemed to be little bits) but we just left it there for the rest of the meal.   Now the rest of the meal was good; I had the Vegetarian Green Dragon Roll + a small Avocado Roll which was pretty good - it wasn't that different from other stuff I've had (which I partially blame on myself since I normally order the same 5-6 things when I go out for sushi) but they're definitely generous with the portions, and you can tell everything is fresh. Unfortunately I was honestly at a 2 star while I was leaving until the WONDERFUL owner chatted us up afterwards - guys, the reviews don't lie. This woman is like the human embodiment of a ray of sunshine! If I didn't have to pee so bad I probably could've stayed and talked to her all night, and she was so great at making conversation and wishing us back. I really do wish my experience here had been better, and maybe I will try going back again, but the fact that that whole gyoza thing happened and I ended up paying for this plate that I never ended up eating really sucked. Maybe one day...."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Such great food and a cozy atmosphere. The staff is so friendly and make me feel welcome Everytime we come here to eat!"}
{"text":"I just came out of here. Ordered the toro sashimi and there was still ice inside of it. I've never had sashimi which is still frozen and looked like it was that old.   Terrible experience compared to other reviews.   In addition I got the poke bowl which was subpar at best. I would never come back here.   One star for service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The staff is very friendly and they have taken care of us every time we have come in.  Last time we were in there it was 30 mins before close and they gave us one of the private rooms gave me extra food because my husband ordered a big meal and I only ordered a la carte sushi.  I would recommend them and will be sure to visit again.  They are my go to for an after movie meal."}
