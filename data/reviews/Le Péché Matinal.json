{"text":"Super endroit pour un petit-déjeuner différent de tous les autres restos à déjeuner qui nous servent la même recette.  Les plats sont songés, délicieux et le service exceptionnel avec des sourires très agréables pour le dimanche matin.  Ne perdez pas de temps et visitez ce restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved getting out of the heart of Montreal (as much as I love it!!!) and experience some local fare, local people. I don't know why this cute little spot doesn't have more reviews- but maybe let's just keep it a small hidden gem? I almost never say this because I love trying new food every time I travel, but I'll be back. Great comfort food, great atmosphere, phenomenal service and very family friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Five stars for food, three for service.  We went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch; keep in mind that they are only open until 3 pm. There was a line stretching out the door, we were told that they do not take reservations. We waited for about 20 minutes but then were promptly attended to. English menus are available if necessary!  The duck cassolette was very good, perfect combo of flavors. We also ordered the egg and bacon omelette which was amazing, with a wonderfully dressed mixed mesclun salad. The bagels and coffee were also quite good. Very reasonably priced.  However... After ordering we were told that the duck would take an extra 15 minutes, then that the kitchen \"made a mistake\" and it would be another 10. We ended waiting almost an hour for our food."}

{"text":"The coffee was dark and delicious. Went there twice, got an egg and cheese omelette that was amazing. The staff was friendly, and the place is quaint. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Très satisfait. ., service souriant belle présentation. , vraiment succulent. ......même ma douce moitiée a vraiment aimée"}
{"text":"Beau petit restaurant pour un brunch. La nourriture est très riche en goût. Vous ne risquez pas d'avoir encore faim après votre repas. L'ambiance est bien et les service rapide et courtois. Nous sommes allés un mercredi en avant-midi. Le prix raisonnable pour la qualité des plats."}
{"text":"Great place. The food is amazing, easily the best breakfast I have ever eaten. The area of the restaurant with the glass roof is a very cool place to eat. The staff and menu were all bilingual and very accommodating. The only downside was how busy the place was, we got there 5 minutes after it opened and it was jam packed by the time we left, so don't come late! A very nice place to eat though"}
{"text":"Magnifique terrasse, un incontournable pour le  le déjeuner. Un menu assez varié  J'ai craqué pour le pain chocolat, canneberges et coulis de caramel"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est merveilleux, déjeuner plus qu'excellent, j'y retournerai n'importe quand à cette place de déjeuner!"}
{"text":"Really nice cafe.  Service is great.  They had an english menu and a separate french menu.  The food was good.  My french toast had swiss cheese and ham on it.  My husband ordered a sandwich with nuts and raisin bread. He loved it.   I Really liked the potatoes.   I love the decor too."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 5/5. The food is SPECTACULAR...Seriously we had a little of everything Omelette Baked Oatmeal Some parfait thing made with squash (amazing) Pancakes French toast Eggs Coffee Adult Beverages Smoothie for the kids  BUT...  The service was deplorable...Seriously we waiting a long time for a table...fine...We ordered upon sitting down. Over an hour later we finally got our meal....WHAT?! Yes...an hour later!  Then it took 45 minutes to pay the bill.  The set up of this place is crazy and has to be breaking some fire codes."}
{"text":"Complètement conquise par cette adresse. J'ai opté pour l'omelette aux légumes et fromage de chèvre, rien à redire sur ce plat, c'était super bon. Les portions sont généreuses et les prix plus que corrects. Le service est rapide et les serveuses souriantes ! Seul bémol, l'attente mais nos 40 minutes d'attente en valait la peine ! Je recommande sans hésitation."}
{"text":"Amazing & Friendly service! My favourite restaurant during my last visit to Montreal :D  Open-faced Sandwich (Tartine with Gravlax) - creamy goat cheese, salmon gravlax, avocado, onions ($13) - comes with a lovely grassy arugula and russet potatoes :)   Grilled Cheese with Pears - caramelized pears in maple syrup, brie cheese and bacon on hazelnut and raisin bread  ($14)   Both were so good! I can't even describe how unique these dishes were because you'd have to try them out for yourself. The dishes were full of surprises!"}
{"text":"Good things come to those who wait! If you have time to wait...a while, this is the place for you! Really fresh delicious food but it takes a while to sit down! We were a group of 4 and waited about an hour on a Tuesday morning. Groups of 2 were going in before us but there was room at the bar to sit immediately."}
{"text":"More than what I expected. The best brunch place I've been to thus far. Delicious food, great ambience and great service. What more can I ask for?   Expect a bit of a wait, but the wait is worth it. Bonus: They even have a menu in English   We ordered the following:  1. Grilled Cheese w/ Pears: 10/10 The best grilled cheese I've ever had. Comes with grilled Brie cheese in between pears and a tasty raisin bread. Came with a light salad w/ hash. Can also opt for fruits ($1.50 more). Great presentation & delicious savoury and sweet taste. Would order this a million times.   2. Grilled Cheese du Terroir: 10/10 This was a great grilled cheese sandwich for those looking on the savoury side. Reminded me of a perogie stuffed with cheddar cheese, bacon, mushrooms & more but with a twist. Great presentation & savoury taste!   3. Country Bread French Toast: 10/10 Big portioning & delicious savoury taste.   4. Banana/Pear Mousse on Banana Bread French Toast: 10/10. The mousse was the best part, nice and smooth with some tiny pineapple bits. The plate also HS their signature homemade Nutella with almonds. If you're craving something on the sweeter side, order this!   If you're travelling within Quebec, this is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Je suis tombé en amour avec ce Resto déjeuner la !! Décontracter et la nourriture exceptionnelle! Bravo au service et au chef wowww!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Definitely a hidden gem - I'd never have found it by walking by.  Inside it's much bigger than it looks, with a cute \"garden\" room at the back, and it's packed with lucky locals.  Fantastic food and service, and fully translated English menu too."}
{"text":"Amazing place for a different breakfast. Staff if joyful, perfect place to start your day !"}
{"text":"Vraiment un excellent restaurant à déjeuner avec un menu très original. Service impeccable et pour moi qui est fortement intolérante au gluten et produit laitier, ce fut au delà de mes attentes! Je recommande fortement!"}
{"text":"C'était notre première fois mais certainement pas notre dernière. Les assiettes que nous avons commandées étaient délicieuses! Malgré l'attente d'une heure, je referais la file sans hésiter pour y retourner! Une belle découverte, c'est un restaurant à essayer absolument... Le service est impeccable; les serveuses nous ont bien conseillés."}
{"text":"Endroit qui gagne a être connu.  Super service, l'omelette au jambon braisé et cheddar est un peu grâce mais succulente.  L'accompagnent de pain aux raisins et noix avec la confiture maison  sont délicieux.  La verrière est très éclairée et conviviale mais l'odeur de la nourriture de la cuisine a coté est très présente par contre.  Nous y retournerons"}
{"text":"Attente atrocement longue  Chocolat chaud à la limite du buvable (et clairement en poudre, pour quelque chose annoncé comme \"chocolat noir 56% blablabla\" Erreur dans une des commandes  Ma cassolette n'était pas assez bonne pour rattraper tout ça.  Déçu"}
{"text":"I came here for a brunch with a few friends. Went out the night before and was hoping for a big breakfast : it was awesome !!  Great service. We waited only 15 minutes for a table. Definitely a nice seating in the back with the greens"}
{"text":"i haven't yelped for a long time but this place was excellent from the service to the wide selection on the menu. if you are in the longeuil area and looking for a good breakfast joint I highly recommend stopping by this place."}
{"text":"The food is spectacularly good. Reasonably priced meals and very friendly staff. Worth the line up at the door! I can't recommend this place enough for a good breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Top notch, great service and food. Little bit of wait but well worth it. Went with sorry of 6 and all of us said we'd return to try out the rest of the menu, can't wait. I had the duck confit, crispy skin, tasty potatoes and the gravy, so damn tasty. Great cheat meal worth every calorie."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Friendly service and most importantly more creative and better tasting food then Chez Cora or egg speciation or any other breakfast place."}
{"text":"First time and it won't be last tune. Food was good, nice and calm atmosphere. Presentation was nice, they don't serve the same type of food you'll find in the majority of brunch place.  I wasn't expected to see that they have kids menu, for sure I'll bring my kids."}
{"text":"I'm not exaggerating when I say this was THE BEST brunch I've ever had. We came on a weekend trip to Montréal and got breakfast here twice. There's usually a line up but it's well worth it for the food. All the dishes we had were absolutely amazing and so different from your traditional North American breakfast. The staff is also extremely friendly and give the place a feel-good vibe, can't wait for my next trip to Montréal/Longueuil to eat here again!"}
{"text":"One of my spot for breakfast on the south shore of MTL! How about a different restaurant that serve delicious Cassolette and funky french toast.   If you're feeling something sweet you HAVE to try their dark chocolate, ginger and pear french toast. Literally paradise in your mouth. The bread has the right texture and is full of flavors. If you're more into salty, the Cassolette with eggs and maple syrup sausage is the one for you.   Downside was the coffee. People could describe me as a coffee connaisseur and I'm very picky when it comes to that. So def not the best here. Honey wasn't mixed properly in my latte, which made it way too sweet.   Service was fast enough when I went and the staff was courteous.   I'll come back and come back again!"}
{"text":"My friends (party of 4) and I came here on Tuesday and it was very busy. We thought that was a good sign because who wants to eat at a place that doesn't have people in it? The hostess told us it wasn't going to be a long wait, but it took about an hour and 15 minutes. Then it took a while for the food to coke as well. That's the only reason for the loss of one star.   Our food however was scrumptious!!! I had the duck config and it was tender, the skin was flavorful and crispy like I like it, and not at all dry. This is how duck is supposed to taste. The carmelized onions eere sauteed perfectly, like the best I've ever had. The mango blueberry jam is heavenly and the bread was the best I've had in a long while. I also had the coconut milk, banana, peach and apricot smoothie and it was also very good."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait awhile but absolutely worth the wait! The food is spectacular even if the service is a little bit slow,  though our waitress was very nice.  I ordered the benedict, the bread pudding was so good, the cheddar flavor was perfect and added just enough salt to the dish. There was a ton of meat in the dish as well. I ordered toast just so I could try the homemade jam which was amazing. All in all, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The legendary brunch place in old Longueuil! It was super crowded there even on a rainy Thursday morning! If you pay a visit here in the weekend then there's no doubt that you need to lineup, so avoid those busy days! I tried their Amarillo latte, which was not strong enough for me, which was quite a pity because it was quite pricey. We took the smoked salmon bagel and a deer meat sausage casserole with homemade bread, very good but a bit too oily. The price is a bit high too, but clearly people are very willing to pay, since the restaurant was so packed. The service was quite good and I enjoyed the overall dining experience."}
{"text":"It's my first time to eat duck leg in Montreal! Very detailed cooking! Nice environment!"}
{"text":"Excellent service et nourriture à la hauteur de mes attentes!  J'ai pris le gravlax, désolée pour es photos, j'avais trop faim et ça avait l'are tellement bon que j'en ai oublié de prendre une photo... : P Très bon café latté et si vous préférez un thé latté vous en trouverez aussi de très bon selon mes convives. Nous y sommes allé sur l'heure du midi un mercredi et c'était plein, une réservation est donc une bonne idée!"}
