{"text":"Food is pretty legit, service can get a little weird at some points. Just a little unorganized sometimes. But overall I really enjoy this place. Get the large queso just do it, you deserve it."}
{"text":"Very bland all around. Over-done steak. Putting wet, shredded chicken in a corn tortilla doesn't make sense to me. I gave this place a second chance and am regretting it! I don't get the hype of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of Sabor and I've been to almost every location they have and I've loved them all. This one is closet to my home, so I was super excited to try it. Placed a to go order and had to call several times before the phone was even answered. I placed my order and was told that it would take ten minutes. I arrived in 15 minutes, paid, then had to wait another 15 minutes to receive my good. I ordered chips with my food and didn't receive it and had to wait another 5 minutes on that. To top it all off, the employees, especially the guy running the register, weren't even friendly. Things happen, but the one thing you can always provide is friendly service and I didn't even receive that. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. Service at the bar is consistently inconsistent.  Bartenders are very nice but poorly trained. The last 3 times we have been there for taco Tuesdays,  orders have been wrong."}
{"text":"Waited 30 min for a to-go order which, unbeknownst to me, sat idle on the counter for over 20 min while the abundant staff chitchatted. I'll choose a different location in the future."}
{"text":"I was expecting to have a new fav. Taco place, but was very disappointed. Soggy, floppy chips, no seasoning to be found in our nearly 50 dollar order, bland salsas, the tortillas are very poorly made and fall apart easily. I do have to give credit to the perfectly fried empanada dough, But the filling was completely void of flavor. The atmosphere of the place is not great either. The line for ordering is smack dab inbetween the pick up window for servers and the tables, and im sure the servers are just as annoyed as the patrons for having to fight through a small herd of people to deliver food. Not to mention the bulidings great acoustics, loud music and screaming workers. I left hungry and with ringing ears. I would have tried a cocktail, but the bartender was very busy with other tasks and hardly at the bar. Ill be sticking with Tequlias in Rock Hill."}
{"text":"best latin street food in the area. queso is fantastic as are the tacos! pineapple habanero salsa is made fresh every day."}
{"text":"Started out great now portion size has decreased. Bar helps and service is good. Add cheese to tacos only ten cent!"}
{"text":"APPALLING!!   $9 for a burrito that was almost all beans and rice. Barely any meat despite the up charge. To make matters worse, we went there because my 10 year old son is gluten intolerant and Mexican is one of the few foods he can still enjoy. We told the server, checked the queso didn't have any form of gluten in, asked to make a note on our order so the preparers would be careful for cross contamination. She reassured us she would take care of it. Two hours later my son was doubled over with stomach cramps and had to take the next two days off school. Really sad to see a 10 year old suffer like that just because a restaurant was so careless. Show less"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, after waiting for 30 minutes plus for our tacos we were told the cook lost our order, most disorganized restaurant I've ever been to. The tacos and queso are pretty good but doubt I will go back unless their service issues are improved."}
{"text":"I grew up in Central America as an American citizen, and I really have to say, I  become so nostalgic every time I go there. People have to understand this restaurant is new in Fort Mill! Please give them a break!!! They have great food and a fun atmosphere. We have seen families enjoy their time together there. Every time my husband and I have gone there, there has been a line but is that BAD?? To me that means that the food is worth the wait!! It's no different than any other restaurant I've gone to that offers good food. I'm excited that there's a Latino restaurant so close to home, and it has become our favorite in the area."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new restaurant in the Fort Mill area, unfortunately we left extremely disappointed.  The set up is very similar to a Moe's where you walk up and place your order except there is a full bar.  While the menu choices looked great, the food was very bland and not worth the money.  Even their salsa was not very memorable.  We like supporting local businesses but the food at the big chains is far better than Sabor."}
{"text":"Not sure where the lower reviews came in for Sabor, this place serves great food and my portion is always huge, usually making for 2 meals. We are so lucky to have a place like this in Fort Mill! I've gone to the Elizabeth location near work uptown for years and it's always packed for lunch. I always get the El Dominicano and guacamole and it's always delicious. The salsa bar is awesome and offers several fresh salsas. The decor is also pretty cool and I love the bar area - plan to come here for low key date nights. So glad you're here, Sabor!"}
{"text":"The ordering process seemed slow and inefficient. One cashier and a line of at least 8 people is crazy.   For me, the food was okay. The interior was okay.   I will probably go again to see if the service is better and to try a different item."}
{"text":"Solid food. Great salsa options and customer service from all staff was good. Quinoa avocado bowl was tasty. The boys enjoyed their BYOBs."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in line for a to go order and moved 5 feet.  Left extremely frustrated and confused.  It was as if each person was cooking their own food...get it together guys, or you won't make it..."}
{"text":"I love the Sabor locations in Charlotte and since I just moved to Tega Cay I was excited to discover they have a location in Fort Mill. The ones in Charlotte, especially NoDa, have such limited seating that you can't find a place to sit! In the Fort Mill location there is PLENTY of seating. So nice. The food was so good and speedily produced. I did go on a Tuesday afternoon so it may be different on a Friday night but I could not find anything to complain about! Love this place and will be going back many times!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos - very reasonable  Can be lots of kids  Phil - the bartender is awesome - old rocker (obvious), makes great margaritas"}
{"text":"Salty and overpriced. I have been several times and unfortunately I always feel I ate a salt block. The nachos portion is huge but no value or flavor in the tacos.  Good mix of salsa choices."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see the negative reviews. We've been twice and it was awesome. I've had the taco salad, chorizo empanada and my fav, the churros and ice cream. It's all great. The service is okay, but the management is fantastic. They have always stepped up when there were mistakes. I'm hoping this place does well."}
{"text":"Not really impressed by the food and welcoming of the staff upon entering.  The food is mediocre to other places.  Tip for the kitchen staff if reheating ground beef please make sure it's heated thoroughly... eating pieces of cold meat was very unappetizing.  No food pics on this one as it wasn't worth taking a pic. The salsa bar was watered down unflavored sauces.   Never again will I go back."}
{"text":"Was so excited when I heard tega cay was getting a sabor. I used to go to the uptown location all the time when I worked uptown. This place is amazing and if you are on a health kick you are in luck my friend. Quinoa Avocado bowl is amazing, add some shrimp and you have just upped the game. Not on a diet, good lord please do yourself a favor and get the nachos or empanadas! Carne Asada fries also take this game to another level. Right now they just have beer and wine! (Tons of local craft beers)  They have applied for the liquor license and we will soon be having margaritas with our food. Lastly, don't forget to stop by the salsa bar before you eat and grab some salsas to add flavor! Pineapple habanero salsa is the shiznick!  That's all for now! No go get you some good good! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed by Sabor. We went on Tuesday for $1 tacos but the tacos were hardly worth that. They were very small ( two bites, maybe three) and came only with a little bit of certain choices of protein and some onions. They tasted ok but were far from the best tacos I ever had. All of the tacos were served \"open\" on the same tray and the meat was touching the vegetarian ones. We had to wait in line for a long time because for some reason they only had one person taking orders. We wanted beer and were told it would be easier to order beer from the bar - it was not. Half of the beers they had on the list were sitting in cases in the corner.    The cleanliness of the place also left a lot too be desired. The salsa area was disgusting with dried salsa over the salsa bar. Most tables were not cleaned and there was a lot of stuff on the floors. I know it was busy, but these are things that have to be maintained.  On the positive side, I did get the last Elote Loco and it was good, but not something I can't easily make at home. I'll give the place another chance and am being generous with 3 stars because I am considering the newness. Some of the other dishes also looked large and tasty so I will give those a shot. But please, get one more person taking orders."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get, better off going to Los Aztecas. I had the pork carnitas and it did not have the seasoning or tenderness that I expected. Have been here twice and not impression with quality of food. Lacks taste and consistency."}
{"text":"The food is legit, the portions are much larger than I expected and definitely larger than other places like it.  Service is great.  Prices are good.  The tv situation could use some help.  The restaurant is in need of a deep cleaning, just as the previous burger joint in this location."}
{"text":"So happy Sabor expanded to Fort Mill!!! Love their food- this location is as good as their Charlotte locations! It is a must have!!"}
{"text":"From the guys that brought you Three Amigos Mexican Grill comes the new crack of Latin Charlotte restaurants. It's fast. It's cheap. It's fresh. And as Dora the Explorer would say it's Delisciouso! Sorry my Spanish speaking friends if I butchered that.  I love these restaurants! I'm so glad one opened up near me! Great Arepas and plantains. I ask for mine extra crispy and plain. Super quick, super yummy! You can't go wrong. Now live a little and give this Latin street food a try. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty good, the service and restaurant itself, meh.  The food took over 25 minutes to arrive; 25 minutes for a taco salad and a burrito. The floors were dirty, the busing and cleaning of empty tables was almost non-existent.  Half of the empty tables had food from the previous customer on them and no one was cleaning them. There is a salad-bar like set-up to choose the kind of salsa you wanted; it was so disgusting with spillage that we just passed on touching anything there.  I will give it another month to work out the kinks.  I really do hope it improves but I was not impressed at all with my first visit."}
{"text":"Happy hour is really good. $1 tacos $3 beer. Beef taco was good so is the shredded chick taco. Best place in town for happy hour."}
{"text":"Good place for Latin food. Taco Tuesday is definitely a must.  You can't beat the $1 Tacos on Tuesday. They're loaded french fries are also a must.  Service is good and the people there are friendly."}
{"text":"I came back to this location after frequenting on and off for the better part of a year. I was double charged, the manager \"David\" told me that he was too busy to correct it and that my credit card company would sort it out! It was your mistake! Along with that, the order was incorrect and the food couldn't have been more tasteless. After getting into it again with \"David\", he told us to \"just go somewhere else and they didn't want our kind of business anyway\". Appreciate it sir, I'll definitely take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant ever since I saw the \"Coming Soon!\" sign out front.  The only word that I can I've for my first meal experience at Sabor is disappointing.  Not only is the price double what it should be,  I was unaware that you could make a bad burrito.  It was as dry as concrete even when dunked in sauce and the flavor was missing.  I will be going back to give this place a second chance.  I hope my opinion will change upon a second try.  However, based in my first meal I not not recommend staying away strongly enough.  Just go to Charanda of Fort Mill."}
{"text":"First visit and was not overly impressed.  One guy taking orders and about 25 people in line was not an efficient process.  Wifey and I ordered the BYOB burrito bowl and although the taste was just ok, the portions were so small both my wife and I left hungry.  Leaving hungry from a Mexican/Latin restaurant you say?  Exactly.  And in most similar type establishments you order a burrito and they throw in a handful of chips.  Not here.  I found myself stealing my kids chips for salsa dipping, irritating everybody.  Also, my daughter's taco shell looked like one I can buy at the local Walmart.  Yum.  On the plus side it seemed they had a decent selection of the local brews, albeit what everybody else has.  We will probably try it again on a low risk kids eat free night but I suspect the results will be similar.  Definitely will not be dropping that much $$ again and having to go home to get the 2nd course."}
{"text":"Ordered our food 35 minutes ago... still waiting...  noisy...  dirty... server with bad attitude...  before tasting my food I can already say I won't be back !!!  OK so we got our food, we'll some of it, Horrible!!  Save your money."}
{"text":"I've been to Sabor numerous times since they opened the location in FM/Tega Cay. Fresh and tasty food - a welcome alternative to the ubiquitous Tex-Mex chains and franchises. Managing the lines during lunch still seems to be a challenge as it can take longer than reasonably expected. Nonetheless, a welcomed addition to the area. Will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Everything you love about the Elizabeth location PLUS A BAR (and much easier parking). That's right, not only can you get your pineapple habanero salsa fix, but you can also belly up to the bar and grab a beer (8 drafts or bottle/can) or wine (no liquor yet, but they're working on it).   The fella and I made the mistake of going on a Wednesday, which is kids eat free night, and the noise level was mucho loud, but we were able to get a little peace in the corner at the bar. Aaahhh. It was slam packed, which could be because of the free kids' meals... or most likely just because it's Sabor. I branched out from my usual tacos autenticos and tried the empanada with beef, and it was divine. We had a coupon for a free empanada, so two tacos, a basket of chips, a beer, and a cider only cost us $20.  Delicious AND cheap AND a bar AND easy parking? Perfecto!!"}
{"text":"When this location first opened, I literally walked out because it was crowded and the line was super long and there was nowhere to sit. After standing in line for about five minutes and not moving, we walked out.   I'm glad to say this is not the case any more. We decided to give it a second try for Taco Tuesday. We were able to order right away. Staff was friendly and explained some of the menu items. I think about three people came to ask us how our food was. On Tuesdays, the tacos autenticos are $1 which is a really good deal. I got three shredded chicken and my free chips for checking in. The hubby also got tacos and loaded nachos.   The tacos were good, but are messy to eat. Seriously grab some napkins. There is a lot of meat on each taco. The shredded chicken was seasoned nicely. For me, the chopped onions were too many for me since I get a headache after eating raw onions sometimes. So in the future, I'll order them without. I liked the salsa bar. My favorite is the pineapple habenero,  a good blend of sweet and heat.   I tried some of the nachos and they were good. The nachos themselves are not greasy and have a good crunch. The toppings were all delicious. I appreciated the guac and the queso was nice and melty. It was a huge portion.   This location used a lot of the furniture from the previous burger place. If you are a bigger person, the chairs can be uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The food here is really great! Fort Mill needed a good Latin food place. This hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Great, easy accessible location, roomy inside, good menu choices, reasonable pricing, have really enjoyed everything weve had on several trips, empanadas are amazing, must get the street corn!....love the several salsa bar options (especially pineapple habanero!, and mean green), only improvement i could say, would be bigger writing on menu over counter, very tough to read (and ive got 20/20 vision!)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and not to be dramatic, but if you think the food is \"too salty,\" you may just need a little more seasoning in your life. I had never been here before and the guy that took my order was very nice and tried to help me pick something and was very patient (I'm the most indecisive person ever). Thank you!"}
{"text":"FRESH food, not your typical overdone refried beans and rice, this is not a fast food restaurant, yes you have to order at the counter and yes it may take more than 5 minutes but that is what fresh not fast food is all about.  What is the hurry, we sat at the bar and enjoyed a drink while we waited."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, in expensive and they have a bar. Portions seem larger at the S. Tryon location. I like the protein bowl after i work out. Only thing that sucks is the fort mill location tries to be more restaurant style and have a full bar but you have to eat with plastic silverware. It's like they are confused with what they trying to go for. Good food though ."}
{"text":"Both me and my fiancé became very sick for 24hrs after eating the burrito especiale.  I've eaten here a few times and it seems each time quality had went down.. this time,  I had a feeling I shouldn't eat it, it was poorly made and the chicken was actually cold.  Learned my lesson, one less place to go for burritos"}
{"text":"this place is very hit and miss but when the food comes out right it's great. I have had multiple dishes come out either wrong or improperly cooked, such as rice so raw it's crunchy. But like I said it's a gamble, either good or not so good."}
{"text":"We got food to go.  The price were higher then we anticipated, as well as the small amount of protein. Appears to be a food-truck menu, but in a building. Not sure if we will return, but my husband did enjoy the loaded fries."}
{"text":"Sabor is the perfect fast casual restaurant for Tega Cay.  Food as been great every visit but i have never been during a rush hour.  Prices could be a touch lower to make this an even more frequented place but overall it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment.  Went Sunday late morning. Not crowded at all.  Girl at register was slow and didn't understand the system.  Had to repeat a simple order multiple times.    Waited over 30 minutes and never received order.  We were told multiple time 5 minutes.  Hard to explain to a Hungary 6 year old. Finally got disgusted and got a refund.   We were given a gift card however.   Will not return. Giving the gift card to the friend who recommended the place.   The food I saw being delivered looked pretty good though. Went to Harris Teeter and got some pizza.  Pretty good."}
{"text":"My wife decided to give Sabor another try and brought some take-out food home - two burrito bowls. We paid for several add-on items but could not find any of them among the rice and beans.   We also paid to add extra protein to the bowls and I had a total of nine small pieces of chicken in my bowl. Very disappointing.   Sabor just isn't good value or quality for the money.   Twice burned. We won't return."}
{"text":"The tacos here are so good, especially on Tuesdays when they're only $1. Nothing's better than $1 tacos. I've also tried the elote, nachos, and carne asada fries which all taste great also but the tacos are the real star of the restaurant. This particular location is tiny and gets pretty packed around dinner time on $1 taco night so going early is advised."}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised with the amount of negative reviews because we are heading back from our first dinner at Sabor and loved it! The salsas were flavorful (much more than Moe's) and the chips were super fresh and crispy. We both got the protein bowl and thought it was delicious. Hardly any wait for the food but it was a Monday. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great staff. The food is delicious. Menu has some interesting items  I went here 3 times in the first month I discovered it. Was excited about this place I wouldn't recommend taco Tuesday. The last time we went they forgot our order. They were out of chicken. We had to go get our own drinks the first time   It may have been their first one so maybe they weren't ready for that sort of volume and we did get their later in the evening  The manager came out and talked to us and took care of the situation we had well.  Highly recommend. The one night seemed to be just a bad night but worth mentioning"}
{"text":"I love grabbing a protein or burrito bowl here. It's a goto for our work lunches.  I would skip the margarita. Think they used fresh lime which my group was not a fan of."}
{"text":"Typical Tex-Mexish.  Good flavor and big portions.  We went in for a late lunch and there was a few people ahead of us, but by the time we sat down there was a line to the door.  Be patient for your food.  Service is friendly, decor industrial."}
{"text":"We moved recently close to this area and this has become one of it favorite places for our family. Food, atmosphere and service are great. It's a keeper!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing especially for Taco Tuesday!! They do every very well and you can tell the GM/owner and has a lot of positive energy with his staff which always makes me happy see."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great customer service. Very good portions. Will be coming here often."}
{"text":"From the ashes of \"Burger Craft\" comes \"Sabor\"! Fan-flipping-tastic! This has become one of our top local places. Much like it's other locations, it's more of a counter-service place. It has tables and a bar area. Great Hispanic food with a modern healthy eating twist. Throw in some craft beers and we have a winner!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and super fresh! I've repeatedly gotten the Quinoa Avocado Bowl- amazing. I love the salsa bar too!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but not great. Although the food was visually appealing, it was rather bland. I most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Update:  We have come back three times to dine in since my last review and it has been MUCH better with the service!  We have always sat at the bar, and every time we have been greeted and served quickly and have been taken care of wonderfully.  Bartenders have been good about checking on us without hovering.  The staff also seems to get along with each other really well and have fun while still doing a good job.  I am hoping to update this to 5 stars once we try take-out again, but I just wanted you guys to know how much we have noticed an improvement when we have gone to dine-in!"}
{"text":"I love Sabor but this location is awful.  We have been multiple times because we kept thinking it would get better because it was newly opened.  It definitely didn't, it's terrible.  The customer service is awful. We waited 30 minutes in line when other registers were available.  They hardly put any meat at all in any entree.  My husband had to return his burrito because he couldn't find any meat inside.  I had to return my Taco Salad a different time for the same issue.  The other times I have went I paid extra for extra meat and they still didn't hardly put any in.  We finally went back to the other Sabor at Steele creek and it was amazing!! They really need to hire different management."}
{"text":"There's a bar! Craft beer. Everything is fresh and hot off the grill. Great, fresh made empanadas (recommend along with yucca fries). Kid friendly, plenty of parking. We're regulars."}
