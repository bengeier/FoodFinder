{"text":"Overall it was a GREAT TURKISH experience with minor flows that will only bother Turks.  The space is open and airy. The atmosphere is very nice with actors portraits on the wall. Kebabs and lahmacun was really on point and the service was good. The food and drinks were presented in an authentic way. I especially liked ice containers for raki. Side yogurt served with beyti was exceptionnel. I wonder what brand they use. And final touch was amazing with the complimentary tea at the end of the meal.  I think the meals needs to be improved in those ways; - the cumin amount in icli kofte was overvhelming. - the feta they are serving is very very low quality ( I think you should try Marce Istanbuls bulgarian feta if you'll be charging $6 for that) - filling for pacanga wasn't enough, I could barely taste pastirma  - yaprak sarmasi was tasteless the thick vaines could have been removed and the filling needs more spices, pine nuts & raisins. - pilaki was more potato & carrots than actual beans."}
{"text":"Lovely design, friendly service, great food.  And best of all, no loud music to drown out our conversation."}
{"text":"Amazing food with great presentations! We were in a group of five, and all parties were very satisfied with their orders. Although the service could use more improvement, but they quickly addressed the issue."}
{"text":"It was a snowing Friday night and the roads were not in the best condition, but I eventually got here.  They seated us pretty close to another table even though the whole restaurant was empty. However, I think this was because of other people booking reservations. My friend had the Alfredo Fettuccine for $18 while I had the chicken kebap for $22.  What I didn't like was that all the non-Turkish entrees were a reasonable $16-$22 while all the Turkish dishes were $23-$60. So if you want to try specifically Turkish dishes for a reasonable price, you will not find that here.  The customer service at times was good but it took us much longer than we liked to get our bill. We heard there was live music coming as were about to leave.  They gave us a big hot air filled bread that resembled a balloon. That was different. It tastes like naan with sesame seeds and the salsa-like dip that came with it was nice.  The food was really good, cooked fresh, juicy, hot, but Bambiyan Kabob has the same dish for $11.50 though admittedly it was slightly better done here. Was the ambience -- which was quite decent -- worth the extra cost? For me, no, but to do it once in awhile or on a special occasion is fine.  The food was an A- but my final grade is a B. If you like good value for your money, I would not go here.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. The meat was excellent, tender, juicy, wow !  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The service and place was absolutely fantastic! The food was delicious and very pretty looking. I went here with family and we all had amazing food, great service and a really nice time. I suggest going here if you ever wanna try turkish food."}
{"text":"Good food but understaffed with servers . One weekday lunch ,they forgot our appetizers , we waited 20 mins to pay our bill. I complained to the manager who did not even apologize or remove the appetizers from our bill. Never go there when it is busy"}
{"text":"Beautiful place with tasty food. I am only giving 4 stars because I think they need to improve on customer service. Pretty Empty restaurant and waiting to be served or at least given a menu. Hard to get the waiters attention for any additional requests or to get your table cleaned for dessert.   Too busy chatting with their co workers."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for the Kebap experience.  Servers are very friendly and knowledgeable. The space is airy and modern. Love the feeling. Copper lined ocakbasi is very traditional and beautiful.  We tried the following; Pacanga, ?cli Kofte, Pilaki, Yaprak Sarma, Findik Lahmacun, Beyti, Adana, Feta and of course Raki.  Pacanga definitely needed more filling.  Cumin was a bit too much on the icli kofte, the texture and filling was perfect.  Pilaki was good. I'm not a huge fan of the potatoes in it but the taste was perfect.  The leaves on the yaprak sarma were tough. This may be due to the season but the veins could have been removed.  Findik (means hazelnut and refers to the small size of the lahmacun as an appetizer) lahmacun wasn't so findik, they were almost full size lahmacun. Nonetheless, it was amazingly good, by far the best lahmacun I've had in Canada.  Feta definitely needed to be a better quality. Raki feta should be much softer and fattier.  Beyti was amazing, yogurt that came with it was the best yogurt I've had in a while.  My adana was on the tougher side, I would have liked a much softer texture and bulgur rice on the side instead of normal rice. The taste and spice on the other hand, was perfect.  They plate everything, meaning all has garnish on it. I think this is a way of Canadianizing the food and is not needed(and creates too much waste). The ara sicaks (or the appetizers) should come out like they do in any high end Turkish Kebap place; the server brings the pacanga, icli kofte or findik lahmacun on plate and distributes it to the customer at the table. No one is going to question the price tag as long as the quality and experience is genuine.  Overall, the best Turkish Kebap I've had in the city. Way to represent guys!"}
{"text":"Scarborough is lucky to have this restaurant!! What a fabulous place. The kababs and the meat are always grilled to perfection. You can smell it when you walk in. The service is great as well. Their Ali Nazik Kebaps are to die for. Possibly the best kebabs I have had in Toronto. Also, their kunefe is incredible! If you are not from Scarborough, definitely make a trip down and try this place. You will be not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Upon our entry to the restaurant, we stood by the door for a good amount of time before anyone noticed us. The time was around 3:45pm and there were approximately 4 occupied tables.   The lady greeter/ waitress was polite and friendly, which at least made up for being initially ignored. After we were seated we noticed all the tables around us had not been cleaned up.  This place is obviously understaffed on a Saturday afternoon.   Let's be honest, food is the main reason for my visit so here it is:  We ordered the lamb pide which had huge chunks of lamb. But the red peppers in it made the dough soggy and everything fell apart when I picked it up. The pide lacked flavour as the red peppers were over-powering.  The mozzarella phyllo pastry appetizer was better, but nothing to write home about. The highlight was the spicy fries that came as a side.   I'll probably be back for the spicy fries.  I must admit, they were REALLY good!!  This place has potential.  We'll have to see if some of the kinks can be smoothed out."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out this place for a little. Finally got into give it a try. The hostess was warm and friendly, the server was attentive and informative. The atmosphere is warm and smell the greets you get you ready to eat. The scent of charcoal burning tells you that the food you are about enjoy is gonna be cooked with love and fire. We had the lamb/veal kebap and the chicken shish kebap. Prior to bringing the mains they bring you a pita with a tomato salsa so good. The mains arrived just at the right time. The portions were a good size and presentation was excellent. The lamb kebap was absolutely delicious and flavorful. I don't have any thing negative to say about this place. It was a very pleasant and memorable experience."}
{"text":"Barans is an excellent example of a solid restaurant to which you would be proud to bring your family, partner, and friends.    Upon entering the vicinity, you will be immediately impressed with the cozy and trendy interior. I particularly adored the open kitchen, wall of photos and knick-knacks, calming blue wall colour, and the giant clocks that showcase the  time difference between Toronto and Istanbul.  Even the washrooms will blow you away!  While  doing your ''business'', you will probably be entranced by the cleanliness and the funky geometric titled walls in monochromatic colours.  Also, capacity-wise, the square footage looks minimal from the outside, but it is actually very spacious inside while allowing multiple groups of all sizes to be seated at once. If you're on the search for an Instagrammable, low-key spot for your next outing or party, then look no further!  Furthermore, the food here is praise-worthy! At first, the prices seem to be on the higher end. However, you'll take back that opinion once you receive your orders. Each item we ordered came with generous portions, and this included heaping amounts of protein. Yes, this wasn't the usual and disheartening case in which you receive a mountain of carbs with minimal protein. Rather, our carbs, veggies, and protein were equal in portion size or, even better, the meat for some of us made up most of the plate!  My party of 5 went bonkers over this price to portion ratio and I will guarantee that you will too!   Additionally, the presentation and flavour of their dishes are impeccable!  My party members shared all of our dishes and there wasn't one side or meat that we didn't think was delicious.  The meats were cooked perfectly, the veggies were mildly seasoned and the coleslaw and mash were mind-blowing for me. I don't usually like mash and coleslaw, but the kind that came with my chicken schnitzel must have been the cooler cousins of these foods because not only were they yellow-orange in colour, they had a deeper, earthy taste that didn't overpower the meat or feel too heavy. Plus, the sauces were buttery, rich, and/or complimentary to any veggie, mash, or meat we dipped into them.  Therefore, we enjoyed creating unique and fun flavour combinations!  If they weren't plated so beautifully that I had to snap a photo of every dish, we would have immediately dove into the food!  Nothing is perfect, but Barans is the closest to perfection. For example, there was a mixup with our order, but the server resolved it immediately and discounted our bill without us requesting the discount.  He checked up on us regularly and was also very polite throughout our meal. Essentially, the level of  hospitality is high here at Barans, so you're not going to get short-changed with poor, unresponsive service.    Overall, Barans is a rare needle in a hay stack. From high quality, belly-filling dishes to chic decor to respectful service and so forth, you'll love your entire experience here. Best of all, you won't break the bank!  Bring your loved ones, your colleagues, your strange cousins, or whoever else! You need to take them here.  It's that dank.   Tip: For those coffee lovers out there, ensure you try the Turkish Coffee. You will receive an espresso, a Turkish delight, a glass of water and a method to the madness (the server will explain how you should enjoy the coffee).  The whole set looks very royal as well for those who like being impressed.  Guess what? This incredibly unique experience comes at an affordable price of $4!"}
{"text":"Noticed this place has been in the works for the longest time and now I can tell why. The owners definitely took their time to make a beautiful looking restaurant with excellent service. You get bread and salad before your meal, and the salad is really good. I got the Barans Mix Platter and I shared it with my boyfriend. It's a really great deal for only $40 and you get a taste of everything. There is enough food on the platter to fill two people up. Super unique restaurant and I can't wait to make my next visit."}
{"text":"This is a nice cosy place on a gloomy fall day. The chicken gives you the same sensation as a warm bbq day outside. The dough of the pizza was nicely done along with the Turkish sausage.   The cheese rolls, the wrap was nice to bite into, however I thought the cheese were too strong. The bread and salad is on the house. Good portion.  Overall a good experience, I recommend people to give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Great new spot opened up last Friday right beside The Arcadia House.   Very cool decor. Smell of fire when you walk in from the coal burning to roast various veggies and kofta. Big beautiful pizza oven to make delicious Turkish pizzas.  Slightly on the expensive side and need better options for lunch menus. Would be a great/reasonably priced dinner location. Interesting alcohol selection, friendly staff, big beautiful chandeliers.   We came for lunch takeout, as it's brand new they weren't as prepared for us. However they offered water while we were waiting and we're very accommodating.   I would definitely come back to try it again once they get the swing of it. Perhaps for dinner. I hope that they get the traffic coming through that they need to stay open as I think this would be a great permanent addition to my scarborough mecca of ethnic foods!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my family earlier today for dinner and turkish coffee. The food is absolutely delicious, service is fantastic (all of the servers are very polite, knowledgable, and timely), the interior design is beautiful and the restaurant itself is quite spacious. The combination of the overall atmosphere, food and service makes this place worthy of a visit. So glad to have a restaurant like this so close by in the Scarborough community! Great for birthdays/dates/family dinners."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on their opening day. Great service and fun trying new things.  May be the shot in the arm Scarborough needs to improve the restaurant scene, which is pretty dismal. I hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place does not live up to the price point. We went as a group of 7 for a birthday and ordered some dishes to share, but after placing our order the servers comes back to tell us there's no rice...yea you read that right. A middle eastern restaurant that RAN OUT OF RICE. At that point we asked if there were any sub sides available and we were told fries or salad (I was so over this place by now, how do I eat an overpriced kabob with fries?!?). We tried to enjoy ourselves the best we could but we will not be returning. However the server was great!"}
{"text":"This is the typical case of \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\". I have passed by this unassuming place numerous times in the past; but have NEVER thought of stepping foot inside, until I saw pictures of their enticing  offerings (thanks fellow Yelpers for your contributions).   Hubby and I wandered in for lunch on a Thursday. We were greeted warmly by one of the waiters and asked to choose where we would like to sit. We chose a comfy half booth and settled in. The dining area is spacious with decor and lighting that's very tasteful  and full of character (please see pics).  I was very impressed by the knowledge of the waiter; he gave a run down of the specialties of the house, pointed out the popular dishes and even explained how they were prepared. He gave us a starter of some delicious warm bread and a tomato cucumber appetizer. It got me excited for the food to come.  WE ORDERED: SIGARA BÖRE?I - Fried cheese pasty roll, a little oily but loved the crisp layers and the dipping sauce. It came with a nice little salad and super yummy, crisp, well seasond fries.  IÇLI KÖFTE  - Fried wheat bulghur meatballs. Tasted like they used lamb for the savory filling. Don't forget to squeeze some lemon on top.  TENDERLOIN SALAD - There was a generous amount of tender grilled steak atop fresh veggies, nicely tossed in a light lemon dressing.  Lovely ambiance, delicious food and stellar service ensures we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"After seeing all the fabulous reviews I wanted to try this Turkish place out, especially since it's near my house.  My friend got here first and told me he stood by the door waiting...waiting...waiting to be seated.  After someone finally noticed him and gave him a table, I arrived.  Then waited and waited for a menu.  We decided to get one of the mixed platters (chicken wings, lamb, chicken, rice, roasted veggies) and asked the server about portion size.   He said good for 1 to 1 1/2 persons - he said he could make it for 1 1/2 portion size.  We were ok with that since neither of us we super hungry.  We should have asked price b/c as you guessed it - they charged 1.5 times the price!  It's $40, but bc they gave us a bit more it came to $60.   In my opinion it's not worth the price.  We could have ordered another dish.  We got about 4 chicken wings, small portion of rice/veggies but quite a few lamb pieces.   The service throughout the night was slooooooow.  It was busy but a meal that should have taken an hour start to finish took nearly 2 hours.  Food wise, the chicken wings were juicy and the lamb was nicely cooked, but nothing that blew my socks off.  I feel like I'm missing something b/c the reviews are so positive.  Maybe I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"So I've been to a few Turkish restaurants but I do admit this one is pretty good !  Why ? On Saturdays they have live Turkish music . And there dishes are very tasty and fresh ! The bread is fantastic as is the yogurt . The Ajran is really good aswell ! For this who don't know what Ajran is please try it lol ! The place is nicely decorated and clean and staff is friendly ! If I'm I the area I would come back !"}
{"text":"Best of best Turkish experience in Toronto. Best Turkish food and live music every friday and saturday we will be back soon for sure..."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out right after badminton. Note to self: we were severely under dressed. Regardless, the service was excellent when we arrived at 6 for dinner. It did start to get busy towards 7 making it difficult to get our servers attention.  Chicken shish kabob and lamb were delicious. They serve fries with their calamaris and bbq chicken if you choose to order and portions were decent size.  Also, thought I'd try out the Turkish coffee. The set comes in an espresso cup, shot of water and Turkish delight.  We would not mind coming back here again."}
{"text":"Barans serves quality Turkish food in a classy and relaxed environment. It's the perfect place to take family, friends or significant others for a nice sit-down formal dinner without breaking the bank. The atmosphere is classy (chandeliers and cloth napkins), the service is friendly and the food the legit (you can watch them cook it over open coals in the kitchen).  I used Barans as an opportunity to introduce my parents to Turkish food for the first time. We started with some complementary fresh bread that came to the table steaming and puffed up from the oven. The bottom was light and crisp while the top was soft and fluffy, absolutely delicious! We shared the Barans Mix Platter for Two ($60) between the three of us, and boy was there a lot of food! There was lamb shish, chicken shish, adana kebap, lamb chop (2), grilled chicken wings, lahmacun. Also, there was grilled tomatoes, bread, rice, salad, fresh onions and red cabbage as sides. An absolute feast!  The meat was grilled perfectly. Each type of meat was juicy, tender and flavoured well. I particularly enjoyed the adana kebap, it was the perfect mix of gamey meat and spices. Great texture and grilled perfectly. Definitely a reorder next time! The lamb chop and the lamb shish were table favourites also. I'm not an expert in Turkish cuisine but I loved this meal!"}
{"text":"I am Turkish and I loved it! I am usually very critical of Turkish food in Canada but the Yo?urtlu Kebap was actually delicious! I have been trying to show my friends something similar to Iskender Döner Kebap and this came pretty close and the taste was phenomenal!   Ambiance was very lively with nice traditional live music on the Friday night that we went! The decor was very luxurious and beautiful while still being very comfortable.   Waiters were also very very friendly and service was great!  Will definitely being all my friends here for an amazing night out!   Afiyet Olsun! ;)"}
{"text":"Adana kebab and ayran were really tasty. The bread they brought was really turkish style, fresh and warm. And it has a good vibe as well. Great location to give a try to Turkish cuisine. Only, they could improve their tea serving and also they should serve bulgur rice as well :)"}
{"text":"The food was great don't get me wrong, however the service was poor. One of the three dishes we ordered never came, and even though the restaurant wasn't even a quarter full (3 servers for 4 tables- however one was a larger group), our servers were not attentive. The house made bread was great however we had to wait more than 20 minutes to get another one halfway through our meal as the oven could only make one at a time. Finally, after it was done, we waited and watched our bread slowly deflate on the counter for at least another 5 minutes.  I don't understand how the restaurant would be able to keep up when it actually gets busy."}
{"text":"I love this new place in Eglinton Ave. Food were fantastic!  A salad, humus and the air bread for appetizer were provided to start the meal. We tried their salads the first time we came. I must say the sirloin steak salad is one of the best steak in a salad I have ever had! The most outstanding thing is that it is less than $15   The second time, we came for a family get-together at around 12 people. Had a few orders of the meat plate and some appetizers. Nothing to complain about, except maybe a little more variety. There was steak, lamb and 3 different chicken meals on the plate. Food was good but it would have been nice to have more beef.  Overall, we like this place. Definitely going back here and we'll be bringing more friends over for a meal."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on Sunday, the food was delicious, the service was excellent and the team was very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This awesome Turkish restaurant stands out in the crowded GTA restaurant scene for its elegant ambiance, engaging experience, and delicious, authentic food.  We stopped by for a weeknight dinner after reading the good reviews on Yelp. It didn't look at all remarkable from the outside, but what a lesson in judging a book by its cover! When you walk through the front door, you'll be greeted first by tantalizing smells from the grill, and second by a huge, open, elegant dining hall. Almost the whole restaurant is all one room, giving it a feeling of intimate opulence. We were seated right next to the kitchen, and it was cool being able to look just over the counter and see the food being made. The restaurant wasn't too crowded when we visited, but it's definitely equipped to handle large groups.  The waiter was very friendly and guided us through the menu, which was full of authentic dishes we didn't know. We got two appetizers to start: the paçanga böregi (good) and the içli köfte (great). Then for our main course, we split the Barans mix platter for two, which was chock full of kebaps and other meats from the grill. It was a great way to sample the many different items they offer, and we both left stuffed. I also decided to be adventurous and try raki, a Turkish liquor. It had an extremely strong anise flavor (like black licorice), and I don't think I'll get it again... but it was a cool experience you don't everyday.  Overall we had a great time trying new things and enjoying the Barans ambiance. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a basic burger spot on the outside but it is much more fancy in the inside. It's a very spacious restaurant with lots of seating.  Havoç tarator (carrot, garlic, plain yogurt dip). It didn't like it. It was almost like a Asiago dip. Some vinegary notes.  Beyti Kabob.  This is what we came here for. Even though it was tasty, it was some purple of my expectations because of a video that I saw from Sirali Kebap in Turkey. The kebab baked bread was like restaurant made wrap but really seem like something you could buy at the grocery store. You could have made this at home. However the meat was well seasoned and tasty. But it was like a purplish red color and perhaps needs to be cooked well-done or maybe it's the seasoning... it definitely wasn't worth the $30  I also had this thing called atom which was really just sliced bananas covered in Honey with some almonds thrown on top. Biggest waste of money.  They also gave us their free appetizer bread which was burnt and crispy. I don't know why they bothered to still serve it to us. We had to ask for another.  I wasn't too impressed by the food personally, but I am giving them a 4 out of 5 for service, atmosphere, and food presentation and authentic Turkish options. I would recommend it for people who would like to try something new. But please don't waste your money on the carrot appetizer and banana dish.  P.s. their non-alcoholic drinks are very limited: Basically your average soda, and bottled juice and water and Turkish tea. They also have a Turkish yogurt drink.  P.p.s. they cook some meat on the open charcoal fire, so the whole restaurant has that smell, and so will you."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, love love love the chandeliers and the framed pictures on the wall.. so much character.  The staff seemed very pleasant and gave us recommendations on what to order.  Keep in mind this restaurant is pricey on a lot of the \"From the Grill\" dishes especially if you're eating for one. These can easily be shared!  I ordered the Ali Nazik which is smoked eggplant purée mixed with garlic and yogurt topped with minced kebab, tomato sauce and butter. The quality of ingredients are really good, I loved the eggplant purée, it was rich but not over powering. $29  We also ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and the breading on that thing was perfect! Yummy juicy chicken on the inside and crispy on the outside. Very filling though so make sure you order this if you're really hungry! $16  The Kanafe is SO YUMMY! I can see myself going there just for that!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for a long time until this restaurant opened I finally got a chance to visit. It took a while for me to get seated and to get my order taken. Unfortunately they made a mistake with my order but i didn't really mind. The food was very tasty. The only reason I am taking off stars is because the place is VERY poorly managed. While we were waiting 2 very parties finished and their messy tables were left like that during our entire dinner while a waitress was chatting away. Also they won't modify your order at all. The decor was really nice too. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service. We had the chicken schnitzel and the grilled chicken.The grilled chicken was dry and the salad required more seasoning.They nailed the chicken schnitzel and thinly cut fries. We were also served complimentary appetizers and a hot turkish tea. Superb decor and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow, definitely a different experience compared to your regular dinner spot. Amazing food, amazing ambiance and friendly servers.   Came here on a Saturday night and it wasn't as busy as usual (my friend has been here a few times and she says it is usually always packed), but maybe because of the ice storm that happened over the weekend. We made reservations before coming here just incase. Upon arrival, we had to wait a few minutes for the servers to clean up some tables even though not all tables were full.  The restaurant is pretty clean from the looks of it and the staff were very friendly. They gave us recommendations and checked up on us here and there. Only thing would be that it was extremely hard to get a hold of a server when we needed them.  The food was AMAZING! I've tried a few items on the menu but my favourites would include the following: - Mushroom tenderloin steak - Beyti kebap - Puree eggplant with minced beef  P.S. there's live music here (Middle Eastern) and it was really good! However, this is not a place to come catch up with someone, because it is SO hard to hear others talk!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, hands down the most tender of lamb I've had in a really long time.  Service was great as well since we walked in right when they were closing. Nothing but the best to say about this place! Highly recommend! Just to add, the starter bread is amazing, freshly made!"}
{"text":"Barans never disappoints with the taste of their authentic turkish dishes. The unique spice mix, the marinades and the coal grill flavour keep us coming back. Adana, beyti, ali nazik and beef kebabs, kofte and lamb dishes are 5 stars. The menu offers a lot of other options, which are good, but not worth the trek. The service is hit and miss, on busy days it takes forever to get your order. For dessert, try the kunefe. Not the best in Toronto, but rich, balanced and satisfying, without being too heavy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night, there was a huge group of 50 and the place felt like a party. Servers were very nice and attentive. We had Turkish friends with us so we just let them do the ordering.  Started with the pita bread like thing that was pretty good. Then got some salad and yogurt dips. Main was a huge platter of grilled meats all of which  were cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the kufta and lamb chops with the yogurt dip. For dessert, we had kanefa, very rich and satisfying with bitter Turkish coffee.   Overall a good experience"}
{"text":"Fantastic Turkish food. Been driving by it for a while and finally made a stop here. Wish we would have stopped sooner. Everything was done really well, food was extremely tasty, service was superb considering they were short staffed. Wait staff constantly apologetic over what they thought was a longer than normal wait, and maybe so but it didn't ruin the experience. All of the staff were hustling and working to hard to ensure their guests had everything they needed. Top notch. We will definitively be back."}
