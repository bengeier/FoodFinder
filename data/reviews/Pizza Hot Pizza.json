{"text":"This a small restaurant on the side of a Hasty Market so there's almost no sitting room except for 2-3 people on the side and they don't have any tables.  The chicken wings are good. The sides like wings and panzerrotti are better here than the actual pizza and they seem to have quite a few sides. The prices are fairly cheap and I found them on the justeats website so they have promos through that sometimes and I order here. I think they also do free delivery through that site if you happen to be in the area but not 100% sure about that.  The bad is the pizza itself. It's not bad but not that great either, main problem is that their crust isn't so good. It is eatable though and it's fine based on Mississauga's low pizza standards but they can always improve it. I can't give it any higher than a 3 though despite the sides unless the pizza itself is better."}
{"text":"I placed an order for a panzarotti and garlic bread at about 8:20pm on a Friday. I was told it would take about an hour since they had a lot of orders that evening. I said that would be okay. I asked what the total would be for the order and the man on the phone responded with \"ok so we will put the order in for you still\" and then hung up.  An hour and 15 minutes later, I called to inquire about the status of my order as I had not received anything. I spoke to the same man I had spoken to earlier. He informed me that my order had been CANCELLED due to them having too many orders. WHY had I not been informed of this?? Apparently one of the other workers said he had called me and spoken to me to confirm the cancellation! Which definitely did not happen! At this point, the man on the phone said that panzarotti TAKES TOO LONG and if I ordered a pizza they MIGHT be able to deliver that. Why offer something on the menu if it \"takes too long\" to make?   I have ordered from this place in the past and the service is usually okay, but not excellent or stellar. They won't be getting my business again because this is simply not how a business should treat customers. There was no apology offered - the man only passed the blame to other workers or the large number of orders they were dealing with. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"This is my son's go to place for an inexpensive descent pizza.. it takes a while for them to prepare because they start from scratch. Their spicy fries' portion is generous and taste good. They have 2-3 chairs for sit in.  Don't expect some fancy joint.. it's quite good for a neighborhood pizza corner"}
{"text":"Upon a friend's recommendation decided to try this place out. Ordered the following yesterday: -cheese pizza -tandoori chicken pizza  -chicken wings (medium) and -fries  All ready within 30 mins. Food tasted fresh and out favorite was the tandoori pizza and wings. Wings were a bit on the spicy side but they were delicious. Chicks pizza was on point as well. Cheese pizza ok as expected...cheese pizza. Fries were ok..a bit on the salty side.   Overall..money well spent. Happy to have discovered this place for future pizza and wings needs.  Ps. The person who recommended this place said their \"seekh kabab\" pizza is really good. We didn't order that but will def will be trying that next as well"}
