{"text":"Gave this place a couple of tries. And every single time I tried, I was disappointed. So really I'd rather drive out of Southpointe to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts to get my mid day coffee fix. I wish there was a Starbucks in Southpointe Town Center!"}
{"text":"was just there a week ago, nice friendly place, latte was spot on delicious.  Will go there again."}
{"text":"Nice bright open space, great coffee concoctions and extremely nice guy behind the counter. What's not to like?  As it happens, I ordered a tea selection (they offer about 2 dozen teas)."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh based coffee shop, they have some of the fresher coffee around, especially when you don't feel like leaving Southpointe to get a cup!  Staff is crazy friendly as well."}
{"text":"Trying their chai tea latte . It's average . Surprisingly weird thing at this store. The lady at counter didn't ask me what size and by default poured me a large glass. Ok, that's fine, then I ask her the receipt , she says it will be emailed to you, ok , nothing new again. I started telling her my email id and she is like don't worry , we have it. Your card is probably hooked up with some system ' square ' and your email is on database. Never experienced something so weird.."}
{"text":"Good location. Clean inside. Pleasant vibe. One person working counter on thursday morning. Ordered something that came to 3.01 and i said \"i dont have a penny\". So she actually gave me .99 cents back! It has been a looong time since a store or anywhere wouldnt put in the penny!  I appreciate her accounting acuity, however rubbed me in a major bad way!  Coffee was very acidic."}
{"text":"OK iced coffee, very acidic. One of the only coffee options in the area besides Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. The cafe in Washington was apparently out of iced coffee so this was my second choice.   I wanted to to try a local coffee shop and I was expecting this one to be in a downtown area since the address is Main St. It's sort of in a weird location, for me at least (an out of towner). In the center of a seemingly newly built complex with large office & apartment buildings and a hotel. I'm sure this is a nice convince for the people living & working there.   Conclusion: Sometimes it's just easier to get Dunkin."}
{"text":"I have stopped in here a couple of times for business meetings in southpointe. It's your typical crazy mocha and they stick within the format of running that all locations do.   Nice staff, spacious and clean. Wifi. Good spot to meet up & they also have vegan options for snacks."}
{"text":"Southpointe has needed a coffee place for quite some time, and Crazy Mocha fits the bill. Delicious specialty drinks and good regular coffee. There's a really nice deal if you bring your own mug -- you save some cash and the earth. My personal favorites are the wild cherry mocha and the chip chopped ice coffee. At Christmas, the peppermint bark latte can't be beat. the salted caramel biscotti is spectacular! The staff is (now) extremely friendly and pleasant. It's one of my favorite coffee places!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little shop in South pointe the on street parking is a little tough to find but you can find parking behind the shop.its small inside but they do have seating and WiFi. It's very cozy and the coffee is really good. The prices are a little less than Starbucks and they have about the same items I always get a large coffee for $2.29 and it's good. The best thing is you don't have to wait in long lines and the staff is extremely nice.  It's very clean too"}
