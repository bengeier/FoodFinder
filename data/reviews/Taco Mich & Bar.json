{"text":"Great Mexicano Mexican. Great tacos and Aguas Frescas. Do not go to those other almost Mexican joints, get some real food straight from the source. The inside is fast food friendly and the tv is a little too loud, however you can always take it to go."}
{"text":"they have a new girl working that doesn't pay attention the green Chile salsa made me sick toy stomach. maybe the food but threw up and haven't eaten since this has been about 4 months and still have not been back. sad part was I loved this place till she started working then seemed like all he'll went loose"}
{"text":"This is a really awesome place. The fish tacos are killer. The Al pastor is amazing. The service is incredible! Not only can you get real deal holyfield mexican food, but you can get a shot of patron and a bud light. You will be well welcomed and treated like family. I've been here a good enough times to say there is really good food and people here. You're crazy if you don't come here."}
{"text":"Great deals on Mexican food favorites such as cheese crisp and burritos. However they double charged me on my credit card once I straitened it right out and I eat here often and they serve up hot and fresh."}
{"text":"First experience not great. Called in an order for 3 tacos this is how the convo went:
Me- I wanna place a to go order for 3 carne asada tacos.
Girl- you want tacos?
Me- yes.
Girl- how many?
Me- 3
Girl- want kind of meat.
Me- carne asada
Girl- your name
Me- Kris 
Girl- your name 
Me- Kris 
Girl- your name
Me- my name is Kris 
Girl- okay 5 minutes.
 
I then walk in and stand at the counter. The girl on the other side of the counter doesn't even great me or acknowledge me. She stands there playing a game on her Samsung tablet. The cook came over to great me then the girl finally took my card. So basically I stood there for 2mins awkwardly staring.  
Meat is super dry."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! GO TO THE ONE ON MCDOWELL AND 16TH ST. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME! 

I have gone to the Taco's Mich on McDowell and 16th st for years and they have the best Horchata and Jamaica! Everything I have gotten there has been so good! My wife and I love tacos mich on McDowell and 16th st so when we found out they have a location near our house we got so excited! We went there today and the front lady was super grumpy...ok no biggie its fast food, I dont expect great customer service, but I also dont expect to be treated like a pain in the bottom. 

The Horchata was watered down and was one of the worst I have ever had, my wife's Jamaica was also the worst I have ever had. It tasted like they added Tajin seasoning to the Jamaica (or whatever spice they use for their micheladas). The food was average, it wasnt disgusting, but when you eat at the location at McDowell and 16th st you will see what I mean. If the McDowell location was a 10, this was a 5 or 6 food. The drinks are a 0, couldn't even drink them. My wife said to the lady that the Jamaica didnt taste good and that it had a spice or something that made it not taste as good. She started to argue with her as if my wife had never had a Jamaica before...my wife said she has had Jamaica before and this lady said that they make theirs different here. I jumped in and said \"you make them different then the location on McDowell and 16th st?\" and she said no at first because they are supposed to be the same, but when we kept asking why it didnt taste the same she said that they dont as much water at this location...blah blah blah! She was basically trying to BS us into  beleiving her story so that she wouldnt have to do anymore work by getting us a different drink or refund on the drinks. I originally didnt want to even mention the drinks to her because she was super grumpy, but my wife was upset because we literally paid $1.59 for something we were going to throw in the trash. Another reminder why I do not argue with ignorant people, its not worth it. 

So overall, food is average. Drinks are gross. Customer service is non existent.  

P.S. they play the TV so loud that you cannot hear anything else..."}
{"text":"Went to pick up tacos from here since it's in my neighborhood and have never tried any locations. When I walked it it was clean and friendly. I ordered the carne asada tacos with rice and beans. I received my order very quickly, when I got home I discovered why. It was the bottom of the barrel scraps of the greasy carne asada pieces, the rice and beans were cold and corn tortillas were stiff and not tasty. Not coming back again, too many other good opinions for quality good food."}
{"text":"Had their 5 taco special pretty decent, the lengua tender and tasty.  Service was great and friendly will definitely will return. Want to try the menudo next."}
{"text":"I need to win the lottery so i can have put a taco mich next to my house, this place is Amazing!!! Truly authentic Mexican food right down to the Horchata and Con tortillas!! If anyone is looking for authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Got the tacos, they are bombtastic!! Salsa was good, pretty spicy. Prices were crazy...CRAZY LOW!!! They also had karaoke so that was entertaining.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We got the 5 tacos w a drink lunch special which is a great deal. However the meat was a bit fatty but still tasty."}
{"text":"First time ordered some tacos and all I can say is horrible. The chicken tacos are dry and mostly onions very little meat after two bites I had to throw them away, the carne asada tacos were just bearable enough to eat. The only good thing we're the fish tacos and the beans and rice even though they gave me 1/4 pint of rice and beans when I asked for 1/2 of each... Don't waste your money go to Taco Bell instead trust me."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. Definitely way better than filiberto's. I'm giving it 4 starts because of the service. The ladies who work here are always friendly. I've gone to other Taco Mitch's and the service was beyond terrible. The place and the bathrooms are always clean here too. 

If you're looking for something open later than 9 pm and don't want Jack, Wendy's, or Filiberto's then this is the spot."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have tried the Carne Asada Tacos, the Shrimp Cevichi Tostadas, the Breakfast Burrito, the Carnita's Burrito, EXCELLENT!  Sit down and have a cold beer or cocktail! There is Menudo available and Posole too, that will be my next try. The prices are super cheap, and the food is plentiful. Open late and very clean atmosphere. One of my favorite spots for a quick, cheap bite!"}
{"text":"I got the 5.99 tacos and soda. Some pieces of Asada were a little dry but still good. Both tvs were a little too loud. Lady was a little blunt but it seemed inside clean and i got my order fast. Nothing extra special but solid. I'd go again. They have a bar too."}
{"text":"This place is very authentic!.  The tacos are small but very good.   The cleanliness and service could have been a little better.  But the food was a great value for the price.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos! For something so simple kinda hard to find good street tacos in the Phoenix area. The Carne Asad tacos are always good but the al pastor is great too. Their take on Carne Asad fries is a little different as well. They do use a nacho cheese and a shredded cheese. Nacho cheese may not sound authentic but neither is Carne asada fries. What makes this place so good to me is there red salsa! It's super hot but has great taste. This location also sells alcohol so you can have a cold one as well."}
{"text":"I decided to try them out because of taco Tuesday. Was disappointed in the size of the taco. Should have been a nickel. I wonder what size there are the rest of the week. Had to order two more. It's not like other places were you can get your own salsa in a lil cup. I was looking for that. Other than that, I guess it's an ok place."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food.  Moving here from Cali, I was t sure how authentic the Mexican food would be here in Arizona.  I was very impressed as it was so tasteful and perfectly proportioned.  Great for lunch and dinner as I've been there for both meals.  Glad it's close by my home as well!!"}
{"text":"Having just moved from San Diego I have been hugely dissapointed in the quality of Mexican food here in the AZ without having a 30 min drive... Now that I moved from Glendale to Peoria I sorely miss Tacos Mich, seriously one of my fave spots and one of the few places I would actually take a trip to. Carne Asada/Al Pastor/Grilled Chx are awesome. I have never had issues with service there but then its counter service and I order straight off the menu. HUGE bonus grilled onions and grilled Jalapenos to bring home with ya, and the salsas are legit..."}
{"text":"This is seriously a diamond in the rough! Situated in the old Submarino's suite on the NW corner of 51st Ave and Northern it's hidden away. My family and I have been to Tacos Mich at least twice a week since we found it. Try the ceviche tostadas and grab a michelada beer. Everything we've tried there has been delicious! Not going to lie though...I agree with a few of the other yelpers that the service isn't always the best, but it is a fast food type setting. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat, they have carne asada and have really good ceviche, I was impressed. The place inside could use an overhaul, it looks depressing and almost not clean, but overall ok. The staff is really nice and quick to start your order."}
{"text":"My go to place when I don't feel like cooking, which has been more than usual. But it's worth it. 

I usually get there #31 which is 3 tacos, rice, beans, and a drink for $6.49. 

Their taco tuesdays are awesome. .85 cent tacos and you can choose whatever meat you want. 

I think they have the cheapest breakfast burritos, and it's the same size as anywhere else. 

The only thing I haven't liked is their carne asada fries. Got really weirded out with their nacho cheese sauce. 

But other than that, good prices and good f"}
{"text":"Great food, delicious drinks, affordable prices...actually great prices! Staff is super sweet and their service is incredible. Try their fish tacos and don't leave without getting a few street tacos!!"}
{"text":"Tacos were ok. Meat, onion, and cilantro. At 75 cents each I would be better off at taco bell. And the girl at the counter wasn't winning any personality contests either. It felt like I was inconveniencing her by ordering food."}
{"text":"A must stop after a night out. Ok, so this chica loves tacos but these are the best after you've been drinking.  Get here before 2am and you can have your last call here. I'm speaking for the tacos only. Trust me, it won't taste the same when sober. Just saying..."}
{"text":"This place is weak but for 90 cent carne asada tacos u cant beat it. The truth is there 90 cents for a reason literally it takes one bit and 80% of the taco is gone. There like taco shots. Red chile in the lil cups  is hot but no flavor Green is good. The lady at the register has no customer service. I rather buy tacos in a lil taco place in the hood.. this place is weak. But I might go back once in a while."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and the salsa was good but the buck stops there..the food itself was terrible.i got an order of carne asada fries w/everything and some red menudo..the carne asada meat was bland and sat on top of a pile of sad steak fries covered with just cheese sauce and sour cream (YES I SAID CHEESE SAUCE) and the menudo was just as bland as the fries..i wanted to like this place but my California roots and my love for authentic mexican food wouldn't allow it."}
{"text":"First time here was great. Good tacos and good service. Second time not so much...... I've been standing in line for 10 minutes and no one has helped me... Wait! Someone works here!! Girl is not friendly at all. No apology for the wait no hello. I hope the food is good this time :/"}
{"text":"Great tacos! 75 cent taco Tuesday! And drink specials like AMF micheladas long islands margaritas beers and more!! Music and spicy spicy salsa!"}
