{"text":"While the ambiance is good, the service is bad, they have flat/weak drinks, there's never any toilet paper in the women's restroom, and there's no sound on the TVs during important games. I haven't eaten here so I can't speak to the food, but I likely won't come back."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to this spot opening for a while!  I live right down the street and drive by it every day.  I went last night with my husband, sister and bro-in-law, and was truly disappointed.  Granted, this is their \"soft opening weekend,\" but you'd think they would strive even more to make a good impression.  We were all truly disappointed in this place.  First off, the service was super slow (our server was very friendly) but overall the service was slow, they take an order and disappear for 20 minutes, ask for more water and wait another 20 minutes.  Our table ordered two cocktails, an old fashioned and a manhattan, both were pretty bad.  The Manhattan was sent back and a beer ordered in its place because clearly this is more of a beer hangout place than a place to order cocktails.  My sister asked if they could make a hot toddy and the server said that the bartenders could make one as long as she found hot water for them.  The server asked the kitchen if they could get her some hot water and the answer of course was NO.  What the heck!? How hard is it to get someone some hot water??  Again, i know this is just he first few \"soft opening\" days but still; come on!  Nothing about this place made a good impression.  Oh, and the cocktails are all priced at $11-$13, no thank you considering the cocktails we had were pretty terrible.     My disappointment with this is that on their street sign it says \"food, cocktails, games, sports,\" so don't advertise yourself as a \"cocktails\" place if you can't deliver.  The whole concept is cool, a place to hang out, games etc, but not impressed with the slow service, poor drinks at high prices for a place like this (the Vig next door is a very similar spot and you can count on yummy drinks at lower prices) and the kitchen not being at all accommodating.  Coincidentally we ended up going to the Vig afterward and they were able to get my sister a pot of hot tea, honey and bourbon=hot toddy.  I honestly don't think I'll come here again, so sad because it looked like a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"My wings were pink and raw. It's $10 for a vodka soda. Next door the vodka soda is $6! Rip off! They shouldn't have opened unless they were ready! On the good side, Chelsea the server is amazing!"}
{"text":"Not ready for prime time yet. One night they were out of food, another they ran out of multiple types of beer, no visible heat lamps outside, massive fireplace that is not finished, corner booth taken up by employees and looked like a mini office, etc. The drinks were great and the food was so so. This place needs to tighten it up quick. It's an amazing location with an amazing concept, but the experience is underwhelming."}
{"text":"This place is busy... no doubt.. however, they still have kinks to work out with food and drinks. 

Been sitting here with three other people, first round of drinks came out in a reasonable amount of time, but second round we were told that the bar is backed up due to last call for happy hour.  Food has taken a long time as well. 

Hope things can get worked out, as good food and prompt service will bring you loyal customers for sure."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places I've ever eaten in. I understand that they are new and need to work out some issues but when the wait is over 30 minutes for some eggs and toast, well, that's too long.  They had a menu which looked very good only to find out you can't order from that menu until 1pm. Then why put that menu out on the tables? Oh for the drinks on the back? Poor excuse, get a separate menu. Oh and how about having some salt and pepper at the table? Pitchers of water at the table would have solved our 10 person table water problem, rather than bringing one glass at a time. As it was we ate in shifts as the plates came out one by one with a waiter walking around trying to find out who on the patio the meal was for. So disorganized! These people need a lot more training."}
{"text":"Nice spot but mainly a bar scene. Surprisingly mediocre food. The burgers were actually poor, dry, underwhelming. Perhaps we're spoiled with great burger spots nearby. Unlikely to revisit"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  It took over 30 minutes for our drinks to come (one of which was the wrong drink) and the food came out about 10 minutes apart, with another order that had been messed up.  Worst of all there was zero accountability.  All the employees seemed to know the service was horrible, but didn't care or do anything about it.  Our first waitress handed our table off mid service because she had forgotten the entire order since she didn't bother to write it down.  The manager was made aware of our issues, but didn't even bother to address our table even though we'd been told he would come over.  And what did we get for this ridiculous meal that took over an hour and a half?   A $180 bill for a table of 4 with two rounds of drinks and lunch.  Save your time and money and don't bother checking this place out.    I've worked in many hospitality environments and I'm very understanding when it comes to service, especially in a new establishment, but this place is a total joke with no excuse for the way we were treated.  I'm actually angry my friends and I wasted any money here (and I've never left a Yelp review in my life-that's how ridiculous this place is)."}
{"text":"The ambience of this place is great, however the service is terrible. We got a table for 4 and we're told they'd text us when it's ready, and we noticed multiple parties walk in and be seated before us (45 minutes later) . When we spoke up they immediately sat us.  We then sat there for over an hour as one drink took over 20 minutes to come out, and the appetizer of \"fondue dip\" aka- microwave pretzels came out cold. To make things worse the same bus boy walked by and asked 6 separate times if \"is this your food?\" Walking to the wrong table each time.  Left cash before even ordering dinner as we were all fed up with the service. The server apologized but that was honestly the worst service I've ever received eating out. This place has a lot of potential to be good, but currently is horrible. Do not go here."}
{"text":"I had the fig mule drink (yum) and fig/goat cheese salad. Was awesome!! Husband ordered Porch burger, he said it was the worse burger ever. I tasted it and it tasted just like a cheeseburger. He said it was bland, no seasoning. Logan our waiter saw that he barely ate it. He told him what he thought. Logan apologized up and down, also about service being slow. But there was a table of ladies in the center that every time Logan walked by, they were asking him to do or get one thing or another which I believe delayed him getting to our table. I saw nothing abnormal with service. Then Eric the manager came over and wanted all of our feedback. Which was awesome. We both talked to him (good and bad) Logan asked us to please come back for another try because he thinks they could make it right."}
{"text":"Such a great place to hang out and chill. Make sure to ask for Josie, she was super helpful and made sure we were taken care of and had a great time!"}
{"text":"I received outstanding service and enjoyed a beautiful fresh scrumptious salad with figs and feta--divine!  Atmosphere is casual, down to earth and welcoming.  Will return again and again.  Good quality food nicely and promptly presented.  GO.  Don't hesitate-- Elaine C."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio with games plus terrific food.
Loved the green pepper rings with dipping sauce. The sandwiches are full of flavor. Service was quick.
Definitely going back with the whole family, something for everyone."}
{"text":"This place was so so good! First off the outside patio is super cute and relaxing. I had the double patty burger which was amazing and only $6 during happy hour! Their ranch dressing I used for my side salad was on point (I'm a picky with my ranch dressing) and service was great!"}
{"text":"Jess was a great bartender & she made awesome vodka sodas!! We had a great time and enjoyed her interactions with everyone."}
{"text":"This place has SO MUCH POTENTIAL. But wooof they had way too much bad to weigh out the good. Let's begin with the good and end with the bad:

1) The food. Holy hallelujah. We started with the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers and the pretzels. Neither blew me away, but both were good. BUT- I got the French Dip Burger with a side of sweet potato fries and I can't rave about it enough. I think I finished it in 4 minutes with not a crumb to spare.

2) Ambiance!  Great out door area!! The decor everywhere is super nice too. Like even the bathrooms 

Ok that's all the good. 

3) We came at happy hour. We ordered the happy hour beer. Specifically asked for 'the one on happy hour'. Instead we were given the size up (which was $4 more) without being asked. 

4) Just like every other reviewer says -The service was bad. We were served our apps without any silverware. Once asked for silverware, the hostesses took 5 minutes to retrieve it. My water was filled once and it was empty for over 20 min at one point. Also -The guy tried too hard - but not enough. For example, see 2). He 'figured' we would want a larger beer. He charged us all completely wrong and one of my friends twice. We tried to flag him down to fix it, but after 10 minutes, gave up. 

I don't know - this place has so much potential but needs some major fixes."}
{"text":"Pretty neat new spot in Arcadia, with nice bar and TV's w/ sports.
Check and check twice your order(s) if you get food to go.
Ordered Chicken Caesar salad w/ dressing on side....No dressing.
Ordered Short Rib teriyaki bowl w/ extra short rib....no extra short rib.
How hard is it to get a to-go order correct/
Maddening.
May return for bar, but no more than than that."}
{"text":"I literally have PTSD from this place. Don't come here after the sun has set. Food is fine. Beer is served in plastic pint glasses. The people that go there are THE WORST. Imagine a bunch of the most basic girls you can think of with their boyfriends still trying to live their frat daddy glory days. Pure amateur hour. Drunk people stumbling all over you before 9pm. Awesome. We were at a table eating when this guy at the bar kept leaning and trying to set his drink on our table for a few minutes. Finally, he fully stumbled ONTO our table. We told him to get his self together. Of course he got in my friend's face, trying to fight him. Once he saw how tall my friend was, his friends quickly jumped in to break it up. His friend explained that he was \"part owner\" of the bar. Uhm...what percentage are we talking here? He's a child. Imagine a bar ran by the worst people you knew from college and all their friends go there. That's The Porch. Can't these people go to Mill Ave and Old Town where they belong? Let us adults live in peace."}
{"text":"Tyler-  The staff is asking customers if they will post positive Yelp reviews, and in return will give you a free round of shots.  

Good luck!"}
{"text":"Went to The Porch for dinner and loved it!!!! I had a burger and the mason jar salad. The food was so good and the drinks and service were excellent. The vibe is very cool but nice so it's a good ambiance. So excited The Porch came to our area!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good (for bar food) but almost $80 for dinner and a drink for two was pretty ridiculous for a bar."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened! We had a great night, and Matt our bartender was attentive and kept the drinks flowing! We have been back twice, and haven't had a bad experience! Not sure why so many bad reviews, but we had an excellent time! French Dip Burger was to die for, will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've had Christina a couple times at The Porch for a server. She has great customer service and good advice on menu choices. I always ask for her when I go here!"}
{"text":"I have returned to the Porch because I had such a great time the other night. As promised, I sat outside on the patio. Nobody told me they had swings out here! I thought the chairs inside were really comfy, but this swing takes the cake. Josie has been my server both times and she was awesome, I wish every server was more like Josie. I ordered the short rib nachos and boy were they tasty, definitely recommend. If you haven't checked out the Porch yet, I highly suggest you give it a shot. Ask for Josie and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went into The Porch this afternoon for the first time with a group of friends. We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by Jessie. She was attentive and helpful going over the menu items. She had a great suggestion with the Mediterranean Mule~ It Was Awesome! We also ordered the jalapeño poppers, So Good! Great service, food and atmosphere... we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! Great place to watch a game or just hangout with friends! The food is amazing, great service and great atmosphere. 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time at The Porch and I will be back. Relaxed atmosphere- awesome patio. Had a late lunch here and it was REALLY good.   I had the Porch Protein bowl, and sweet potato home fries. YUM.  I am craving both now.  Service was good too."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the Rueben sandwich.. surprised it was on a pretzel.... Not good.. As for the wings they were delicious.. The street tacos not impressed either... For the price I left hungry.. The valet parking was great.."}
{"text":"This place sucks. We live very close by so we often walk to the places on this corner. The first time we came, we only had a couple appetizers and drinks and it was ok. And then the second time, our waiter was basically non-existent so we ended up having to ask for him and he still took forever to come around and the place wasn't even busy. Because of that we ended up not ordering food and asking for the check when he finally came around. Today, we decided to get them another chance for brunch and again we were not given any service. The hostess sat us but nobody ever came to take our order even though the place wasn't even busy. So needless to say, we got up and left and went to another restaurant nearby."}
{"text":"Being a new neighborhood spot I had to check it out. My bf and I loved the food, but service was subpar for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to the Porch three times now and all experiences have been pretty great! It's the perfect spot for a happy hour, a casual dinner, or late night drinks. 

Food (4/5)
The menu has traditional bar food items with a bit of a twist. They also have some healthier salads and grain bowls (The Porch Protein bowl is delish!). All items range from $8-$15. Also, the cocktail menu is awesome with lots of delicious, unique options. My favorite is My Ex-Wife Secret - cucumber vodka, watermelon syrup, lime juice and soda water. They are dangerous!

Service (4/5)
I've had two different servers and they were both very friendly! They do always seem a bit confused and unable to answer some questions, but they are typically pretty attentive. 

Ambiance (5/5)
The vibe is really great here! I love that it seems like more of a neighborhood hangout instead of a dingy bar environment. The outside patio is super cute with lots of fun bar games - bags, Jenga, etc. 

I'm glad there's a new restaurant and bar to add to my Arcadia rotation!"}
{"text":"Really poor service. We sat at the bar with empty drinks for well over 5min with 6 employees behind the bar chatting with eachother. 
Completely unacceptable. 
There is nothing special about this place which is just too bad. Just basic. 
Drinks are served in plastic glasses which in itself is not necessarily a problem, the the dirty water spots are. Also, please use short straws in short glasses. I saw them on the other side of the bar but got a super awkward long straw in my drink. Water was served in a rocks glass not a normal water glass like everyone else at the bar. 
I do like the bars stools and that they are not crammed together giving people some space. 
 Hopefully it's just growing pains but I have a sneaky suspicion it's not."}
{"text":"Such variety in the menu, they have something for everyone. Stop here today and try the apple pie dip - you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting with my boyfriend and we drove by the porch. It looked nice from the outside so we decided to give it a shot. I ordered the salted pretzel and the Mediterranean chicken pita. Pretzel was good but they really hit it out of the park with the chicken pita. Service was great and our server was super friendly."}
{"text":"Favorite hangout in Arcadia! Really fun but chill patio atmosphere with games and different seating styles. We always bring our dog and the staff is really friendly and accommodating to her. The blueberry mule , parmesan fries as well as the short rib nachos are a must try!!!"}
{"text":"First visit to The Porch for an early dinner.  Six of us were seated promptly and server was there immediately to take drink orders.  (We all had water, so I can't comment on the beer/wine menu.  I'm not sure I even looked at it.)  I can't vouch for the rest of the items on the menu, but the Mason Chopped salad was excellent!  We had four kids with us who ordered the soft pretzel and loved it.  The beer cheese was really good.  The only thing I didn't care for too much were the stereotypical Hooters-esque servers.  Big boobs, exposed bellies - not so much, thanks.  Lots of people are ok with that, which is fine.  It's just something to take note of if you're dining with early-teen boys.  It was a little distracting.  :-)  Parking is really tight.  About 90% of it is valet.  The Porch is still pretty new, so we'll definitely be back to see how it evolves.  It has great potential."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last week. Something on the menu for everyone. Great casual layout and perfect for large groups. The service was outstanding- we were surprised because it was a busy Saturday night and the hostess and servers didn't miss a beat! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been to the porch many times! I always order the espresso martini. Christina was our server this time and she was great and engaging!"}
{"text":"The porch is really just okay. The service was hilariously bad - we had to ask for water and silverware. The music was a little too loud for regular dining; we had to shout to make sure we heard each other even though we were sitting next to each other. I had the green Chile pork tacos and they were good. The cocktail I had, the Cabin Fever, was pretty gross. It was basically a way-too-sweet old fashioned. I can imagine that it's a fun bar to go to, but as a place to eat dinner it was subpar, especially considering that it is close to a number of better places which are at the same price point. Because of that, I won't be returning to The Porch."}
{"text":"Just keep driving and go to OHSO. 

As a proud dog mom, I am always looking for great places to take my little fur child to eat some dinner. Not only was the staff rude when I called to make sure their patio was dog-friendly (this should've been a clue), our original server was so terrible that after we moved tables our new server was ALSO saying how bad she was! WHAT?! 

The food was horribly overpriced and wasn't good. Service was terrible. 

Husband was irritated, dog was irritated, and we paid $75 to end up still hungry."}
{"text":"Initially thought the atmosphere was awesome and was super excited to try the food. The food was just ok, nothing amazing. I split the French dip burger with my boyfriend and he also ordered the poppers and a beer. Everything seemed to take a very long time. The waitress told him 15 minutes after ordering his beer that they would need to change the keg. When he asked for a refill, it took just as long. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything to write home about. Poppers where very dry and the burger was just ok. The horse radish sauce tasted a little more like mayo. We are not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal. The waitress we had was so happy to be there and was so friendly! We went for happy hour around 4 and it wasn't too busy. Not in love with the mandatory valet but it was still a great time with good happy hour deals. There were vegetarian options, I got the short rib nachos with the short rib on the side! The atmosphere was fun and they had sports games on the TVs as well!"}
{"text":"Food was underwhelming, beer list is average, and the servers seemed inexperienced. Hoping this place gets its stride and can pull it together. Seems a bit unorganized at the moment but seems promising if they can get it together. I'll definitely try it again and hopefully update this review."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday around 11am with a couple visiting from out of town.  

First...ambiance is awesome it's very open and has a great patio.  A fireplace separates the dining area/patio when the cooler temps set in. Parking in this area is usually a hassle but not here.  We pulled up and were immediately greeted by the FREE valet...woooohooo! 

We were ready for a few bloodies and some breakfast.  Had the breakfast burritos and they were amazing...bloodies had the right spice and a large piece of bacon for stirring.  Nice touch!

Oh....and the beer menu.  Very impressed by the microbrews with a few of my favorites, Sculpin and Guava Islander.

We happened to run into the owner John and you just sense he cares about getting the details right and delivering for his customers.   If you're looking to support a local business that has a friendly vibe with great cocktails and food GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"OK can here on a Sunday morning. First time. They have the absolute best wings anywhere. Service was great....atmosphere is fun and relaxed everyone is enjoying their late Sunday morning early afternoon cocktails. Cool that dogs are allowed. Also they have an awesome tap beer menu. I would recommend this as a go to for patio bar fun..."}
{"text":"Third time there. Great relaxed business lunch and the staff was amazing. I had the protein bowl and it's ridiculously perfect for a healthy lunch. So much better now that the lunch crowd has slowed a bit so I can park easier"}
{"text":"Really good food!  Wonderful atmosphere and love that they have a dog friendly porch area!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and its truly a great place. The mason chopped salads are bomb and the chicken tenders are on point. But what really makes this place awesome is the staff. Josie and Kennedy are by far the best servers,they are just rays of sunshine and are so attentive. All the managers are very friendly giving the whole place good vibes. Loveeeee itttt!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch at the Porch when we first got to Scottsdale and heard a lot of hype about this restaurant/bar in Arcadia. Great staff and atmosphere. Our server Lauren was able to hold a conversation, knew the menu well and was able to sell us on some enjoyable short rib nachos.  Along with numerous craft cocktails."}
{"text":"Really neat looking place with a big bar, outdoor patio, and several convo areas. Lots of TVs too. Unfortunately the food wasn't good. I spent $21 for a crappy salad with no flavor and an iced tea. The mason jar salad has no flavor and then I added chicken to it that also had zero taste. Spices & seasonings must not have arrived yet."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger in town!  We had the Porch Burger and garlic fries and they were amazing.  Cooked to perfection with a great sesame bun.  Tyler and staff are awesome!  Beautiful decor very comfy seating.  Just love this place :-)"}
{"text":"We had drinks and dinner at the porch. I had the south of the border Marguerite out which was fabulous and the fried pickles were excellent as well.   Logan was our server and he was a wonderful waiter!  Then we had the coffee and Passport coffee is the best!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with the porch! Food is always great. I haven't had an item i didnt enjoy yet. And I am still exploring the menu. HOWEVER my fav is the waffle cut fries! Yum! Always enjoy the fun atmosphere and seeing our favorite server Nicole D. The porch is a must visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited for this place to open and unfortunately, it's been a disappointment so far. The food isn't great and the service is pretty shotty. First time I went with a friend and it took 45 minutes for our dinner to come out...all we ordered was tacos and a chicken bowl. The chicken in my bowl was extremely over cooked. It was actually hard to cut it was so tough. Second time at the restaurant, my order was wrong and my hubby's \"hand breaded\" chicken tenders tasted more like frozen chicken fingers. He said the chicken tenders at McDonald's are way better and much cheaper. When my correct order arrived, it was pretty bland (med chicken wrap). No flavor and the sweet potato fries were so fried that they were really too crispy and lacked flavor. Once my correct order came out, our bartender disappeared so I wasn't able to ask for any hot sauce to give the wrap some flavor. There is so much potential here but unfortunately it's falling short. Hopefully it will get better. Also, the music is really, really loud so having a conversation is tough. I do hope they can make some changes to their quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Logan was awesome! We had a huge birthday party for two friends with a huge rotation of friends coming and going he remembered all of our names and made our group gathering fabulous and easy! I got the chicken fingered and they were delicious."}
{"text":"I guess Scottsdale has taken over Phoenix.. you know, the snobsdale we Phoenicians try to avoid..

Unfortunately, it's not the guests but the people who work at the porch. Twelve people on staff and no one even had the decency to say hello.

Thankfully we walked across the street and was greeted warmly by CBCB."}
{"text":"I came here when the porch first opened and the service was incredibly slow. I am happy to say my second experience was so much better! We came in for brunch and mimosas and Logan took great care of us! He made sure our mimosas were always full and that our food was exactly how it should be. Thanks Logan for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But sat by the hostess with a table of five and for over an hour not a single staff member greeted us or said hello. We were just there for some drinks so just decided to walk up to the bar to get serviced."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to this place opening, and brought the family on 2/1. Was hoping to see a few more Gluten Free options on the menu, but was even more disappointed when the server told us the GF chips are not to be trusted as GF since they are cooked in the same fryer as the non-GF items. That was a great catch by the server but a mis-representation on the menu. 
Overall, the environment has potential, but service was slow, and menu options could use work. I take the under bet on this place succeeding unless they make some quick changes."}
{"text":"Read a bunch of the bad reviews but personally had a really good experience. Reuben was outstanding. Sweet potato waffle fries were top notch. Daughter really enjoyed her chicken sandwich with truffle fries. Good beer selection. Service was prompt and pleasant. Great layout and decor. One beer order error was promptly corrected. Only minor complaint was awful plastic beer glasses. Would never order a draft beer here or if I do I'd ask for a glass glass."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  The server never wrote anything down so our food came out all wrong. Waited forever for drinks, had to ask for silverware and had to ask for a spoon to eat chili with......total joke and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Perfect daytime spot for games and drinks. Very accommodating for a laid back date spot or a large group. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this place as it was going up. For the last few months I have been passing by it on my way to a local school to work as a Student Teacher. Today was the last day I needed to complete before I graduated. My husband wanted to celebrate and take me somewhere nice to celebrate. I requested The Porch thinking it would be a perfect fit. 
Upon we put in our name with the hostess. She warned us it would be a 30 minuet wait. It was a little chilly outside but we thought 30 minutes wouldn't be to bad. She took our name and phone number and told us there were games outside to play. We walked around looking for the games but they were awkwardly placed near diners and it didn't feel comfortable to step up. We looked around inside and saw a good number of open tables meant for small groups so I figured the 30 minuet wait would be accurate.
We sat outside on cute lawn chairs and waited for the Text for our table. After 45 minuets my husband went to check on the wait time, he was told 6 couples were still ahead of us. I looked around the dinner and outside area and still saw open tables. After an hour and a half wait my husband went up agin and asked. We were told the only way we could be seated was if we shared a picnic bench with strangers outside. I was hungry and agreed. As we passed by their were still available tables inside that apparently we were not good enough for. The people next to us acted surprised that we were seated and while I didn't ask them I assume they were not asked if they would share they way they reacted. 
So we sit outside looking at menus, no space heaters, no fire in the fire place. 15 minuets go by and no one comes. Finally a guy named Jeff stops by asking us if the food he has is our order. We tell him now and inform him that nobody has been by to check on us. He tells us very friendly that he will find her server and leaves. We wait some more and decided has finally been enough and agree that we will leave to go celebrate somewhere else. Jeff meet us as were leaving And informs us that he is been trying to look for server I can't find them. We tell him everything that went down and that Larios ready to leave. Jeff was very friendly and I bet if he Had been helping us in the first place the situation may have been different but it wasn't enough. I can't even write a review about the food or drinks or anything else because the whole experience was so bad I'm not sure what to even say more but avoid this place.
I hope that management repress and correct the situation so that this can be the new addition to the community that I hoped it would be."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to check this new place out! He arrived before me and had trouble waving down the server. Once I arrived, we noticed that the server section was too much and he could never get caught up. It was hard seeing such a great server drowning while management was just standing there. 
When we attempted to order the PBLT, we were informed that they decided not to work with pork belly...? Why have it on the menu...? I thought this was interesting considering they just opened... 
I ordered the vegan poke bowl and the portions were incredibly small for the price. When the nachos arrived the steak was cold, but had decent flavoring. 
Between the portion size and cold steak I had to give 3 stars. Hopefully before Phoenix's busy season they can figure It all out."}
{"text":"I was here again this weekend and the same bad service. Place was packed but servers are not doing what they are supposed too, we had a girl with horrible attitude, food was OK not great.. music was good. Server brought the wrong beer to my friend and instead of apologizing she was trying to convince  us that it was the right one ! We know how a blue moon looks and taste! Please! --- service is horrible and I can see I am not the only one complaining about that! Too bad I really wanted to like this place! :("}
{"text":"Pretty good experience last night- the giant mules ($40) and the pretzel with cheese were great! Super fun vibe and very accommodating to our large group of 8. Service could have been faster but they were packed so understandable. Nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"1st time here and let me say I was not disappointed. The food was amazing and the staff couldn't have been better. Several came by and chatted it up and answered questions we had about the place and the menu. Hannah D. However set the pace for us tonight, one I hope to return to soon. This was a great night all the way around. Thanks Hannah for everything."}
{"text":"Came here for our second time since their opening.  The first time service was slow and we understood because they were brand new. This is now two months in and they still haven't figured things out. We looked to give feedback to management but couldn't find anyone other than the server and hostess. 

Food was mediocre: split the house burger and their fig, goat cheese salad. 

Living in the neighborhood with so many restaurant choices I'm not sure we would come back."}
{"text":"So very sad and disappointing.  Went there for dinner on 12/20. My husband and I were so excited for The Porch to open and were already planning having a party there b/c the patio looked so cool. Sadly, that will not be happening as the overall decor was really the only redeeming quality we found. 
We were seated pretty quick, but from then on the service went downhill. We were a group of 5, we all ordered drinks and 2 appetizers. 1 person never got her glass of wine, and after 10 min we had to flag down the waitress from across the room, and then waited another 5 min for it to arrive. There were huge gaps in service and it took forever for things to come out. Finally, the meals come out, and they forgot my husband's meal. The waitress came over, noted that he didn't have his meal and left.  Over 5 min later, she returned, noted AGAIN he didn't have his food and stated that she would look into it.  Why didn't she look into it the first time she noticed that it was missing? Come to find out, the kitchen never made it. She said that she would them make it quick.  After another 15 min, we told her to forget it and my husband no longer wanted it.... Miraculously, it then showed, but at that point is was way too late. She said she would comp it, but, honestly, comping something that we said we no longer wanted is really too little too late. In almost any restaurant I have ever been to, by this point we would have seen the manager in order to better address the situation and at least apologize, but we saw no one.  My generally easy-going husband was livid at this point b/c we spent over $30 per person without his meal and she couldn't even throw in a free beer for him.  
The food was mediocre.  I am gluten free, so I had the only meal option available in the Poke bowl.  Very rice heavy, decent amount of tuna, but only a small amount of veg and very dry due to minimal sauce.  My friend didn't like her chicken and waffle wings b/c they were drowning in sauce and wasn't a huge fan of her boyfriend's chicken tenders either. Husband never got to try his meal....
Finally, though the decor was nice and the patio cool, they left the sliders to the patio open and it was FREEZING.  Music was also too loud, making conversation difficult. 
In hindsight, I should have looked the reviews b/c this seems to be a common theme.  I am sympathetic to them being newly open and growing pains, but just do the right thing by your customers so they leave happy."}
{"text":"First time here.  Awful awful awful service.  Undercooked food. Waited 25 minutes for a beer to be delivered.   Waited 30 minutes for food.   

Waited 25 minutes for the check.   

So not returning!"}
{"text":"After my workout, I went to brunch with some friends and it was the most fantastic brunch in Phoenix!!! Amazing service by our waitress Evelyn, couldn't have asked for a better time!!!!"}
{"text":"I liked this cute place but did not love it. The bar itself was cute and fun with outdoor porch swings and games. I was not impressed with the staff who seemed to busy checking their phones to greet you at the door. We literally had to wait for the hostess to stop texting and acknowledge us."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere & great DJ.  Yes,  I agree, why all the negative reviews? This place is great  for the neighborhood. Just chill and have a great  time."}
{"text":"i was excited to bring  my family in for dinner as this was a new restraunt in the neighborhood.when i walked in, it did not seem family oriented for one.
number two, we were greeted by two hosts that did not appear very enthused.
We decided to stay to give the porch a fair shot. We were seated in a round comfortable booth, not much to choose from the menu but we all made do.
When our food came out it was all cold, except the kids meals.The waitress never came back however i was able to track down the manager she asked to repack the meal but we declined so she refunded part of the bill. When our waitress finally made it back to our table to give us our bill, we quickly put the cash down wanting to leave but we had to wait for our change. She took at least ten minutes to show face, so we had to ask another associate to have her bring back our change. when she finally made it back, she threw our change on the table and walked away. this was unacceptable behavior nor is this a restraunt i will ever return to.
Terrible review from the host to the waiters. 
by far the worst service i ever had.
The talk around arcadia we are not the only unhappy customers"}
{"text":"Was disappointed in the food and the service. Ordered pita with waffle fries. Food came, pita was in need of salt and the sauce drenched everything. The fries tasted fine but were cold. Others in party had the porch burger and enjoyed it, the grilled cheese and wouldn't order again. No one came to check on us until time to pay the bill. 

Overpriced, mhh food, bad customer service."}
{"text":"Surprise bday party here last night, they did a bang up job with the outside area and gave use the most amazing server....Kennedy just killed it!  Over 30 guests and she handled all the individual tickets without error and with a fantastic smile and attitude.  Incredible atmosphere and great people...definitely headed back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and drinks are great. Food tasted great. Unfortunate part was the porch burger. It looked like it was put together by a prior McDonalds worker or someone who doesn't care about their job. I cut my burger in half and all of the meat ended up on one side. Courtney was great! Very attentive and had great suggestions."}
{"text":"We were excited to try the porch. Made a reservation Sat night for 13 for Sunday brunch. Upon arriving, all 13 of us were promptly seated...at a single picnic table. We moved the six kids to another table not reserved and heard the waitress mumble \"what the hell do they think they're doing?\"  We then ordered the kids meals - 5 of 6 arrived and they were out of our beer choice and wine choice. The avocado toast was good as were the breakfast nachos. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the staff was rude and the \"Porch\" is situated on Indian School, we will continue looking for our Sunday brunch spot"}
{"text":"Food is great
Atmosphere is up beat and fun
Service is a little delayed but it's a relaxed environment so it never feels rushed. I have been here for 2 going away parties and 3 times for lunch and all experiences have been positive. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Kennedy is awesome! Gold star for her.  Ordered 4 bottles of Rose for Sunday Funday! (:"}
{"text":"Love The Porch.  Friendly atmosphere great food.  Jessica the Bartender is fantastic .  Cute, friendly and knowledgeable.  Great combination!!!"}
{"text":"Nice neigh-hood spot, service the best, good burgers,
Upbeat, great for watching the game and just socializing."}
{"text":"What a great find for us! Recommended by locals, The Porch was a fabulous place for lunch for our family, as we were visiting from Chicago. This place is so cool, offering fantastic food options that made deciding what to eat kinda tough! The flavors were great, we ended up sharing everything so no buyers remorse!! I especially loved the outside patio with picnic tables, swings, and games. We can't wait to head back in the evening to check out the nightlife side of this place!!
Parking is tough, but complimentary valet parking took care of that for us. We learned the owners also run The Bevvy in Scottsdale, more of a sports bar, so heading there over the weekend!!"}
{"text":"I love this place - the atmosphere is fun and energetic- the AZ Green Chile burger is amazing - the servers are great - we sat at the bar and Henry took excellent care of us!! Highly recommend The Porch."}
{"text":"The food had mixed reviews the tacos were awesome and the grill cheese sandwich was the bomb. Sadly the wings didn't hold up to the standard there other food set. Drinks were good and ambiance for a Tuesday was okay. We will come again! We were told that weekends the atmosphere changes significantly."}
{"text":"Kellyn is an amazing waitress! She was so patient and nice to my crazy mom and her crazy friends! We had a great time. The food was yummy and we loved the vibe in the restaurant. Thank you Kellyn for being so attentive and sweet. :)"}
{"text":"I really was excited for this place to open.  Looked like it was going to have great ambiance and an awesome menu PLUS the new bar for Univ of Arizona Game Watches... amazing!  Turns out I was completely wrong.  I never tried the food because in the hour I was there, the hummus I ordered never came.  The burgers we were going to order also didn't come because the server barely came back enough times for us to place that order.  It took OVER 45 minutes to get one beer.  The best part is after I told the server to cancel our next round, the manager came over to apologize and said he wanted to make it right.  We stuck around for another 15 mins watching him NOT get us our beers, not rush out our food or assist in any other way.  Worst service and worst management I have seen in a very long time.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"First time at the porch and it did not disappoint. I've heard both positive and negative things about it so I jumped onto Yelp, read some reviews and decided to give it a go. The service was fantastic and the food was great. I sat inside and they had on an abundance of sporting games on which was great. Great ambiance and overall feel. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to check this place out since it opened, but the reviews were so bad.  We decided to give it a try anyway one weekend last month.  

Pros: Nice atmosphere (inside and out), good cocktail (Cougar Bait), tasty pretzels with cheese fondue and a friendly staff

Cons: Super slow service...our server never showed up at our table, so we found two seats at the bar; however, our bartender disappeared for quite some time too.  

Hopefully they can get the kinks worked out on the service side as this place has the potential to be a real success!"}
{"text":"Burger was good Karma friendly staff, good atmosphere, and a nice mix of all kinds of music"}
{"text":"Lilly recommended the porch burger and it was grilled to perfection. She was punctual and always around when needed. Loved the environment, definitely coming back when in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is freaken awesome !!!! We had great service!! Where should I start !?  
We ordered the waffle battered wings, French dip burger with truffle fries and several cocktails. Which turned out to be amazing !!! I never had wings with that sauce it was sweet but not overly sweet which went well with the chicken and for my first time trying a French dip burger ! Holy cow it was amazing!! Our waitress was fast and responsive regardless of the amount of people that were there ! It was busy night great vibes and atmosphere !"}
{"text":"First time at the porch, we had such a blast and amazing service! Bruce helped to make sure we could accommodate our party. 

Will. Be. Back."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this new Arcadia spot, but it fell short of expectations. Most of the food was quite good, I liked the pretzel appetizer and the grilled cheese with short rib. When we sent something back the manager never stopped by our table to talk to us about what went wrong with the dish (chicken tenders- the breading tasted oddly sweet and moldy to me), and our server was clearly uncomfortable because she knew we were upset. We would have stayed for a nightcap and dessert but being charged for something we didn't eat or like because \"it's so popular\" and \"no one ever complains about it\" made us feel quite stupid.  It's a shame because the patio has a great ambience and we go out for a drink quite often. Unfortunate that the manager can afford guests walking out unsatisfied without even a table touch. I literally never write bad reviews- I'd rather contact the restaurant directly, (would have ideally preferred talking to the manager that night but it was clearly not an option) but when I called I was put on hold by a hostess and no one picked up the line after ten minutes. Too many pieces of the puzzle went wrong for us to spend our money here again."}
{"text":"French dip burger was wonderful! And the wind address great too.  It is a bit pricey though"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Just wanted to grab a cold one. Great service, sat at the bar AND they have the most comfy stool chairs to sit on, was getting to comfy, lol.
I ordered the jalapeño poppers, yummy! 
Will be going back to try out a meal"}
{"text":"Honestly I really enjoyed this place!!! Not sure what's up with all the negative reviews, I would definitely recommend trying it for yourself because I had a great time! 

I went for happy hour, and we ordered a bunch of apps. We had the pretzels and cheese (literally so buttery and delicious), jalapeño poppers wrapped in bacon, French fries, bruschetta, and tostadas. All of it was brought out promptly and it was all so yummy! We also ordered drinks - I had the fig mule and it was so refreshing. I would definitely order it again! 

The outdoor space is super cute and they have lots of games and TVs. It's right next to the street, but I honestly didn't notice the cars that much at all. They have high fences and lights so I barely noticed. 

Our server was super friendly and attentive. He made sure our waters were full and brought out a dog bowl for our furry friend! 

I would definitely come back here! Take all the negative reviews with a grain of salt because it might not have been ready to open when it did, but it's up and running and a great time now!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great place to go for drinks with friends!the music is good, current and old school."}
{"text":"Love this place, dog friendly, love the feel and the ability to eat outside. It's a nice little spot and been there several times. Highly recommend going there at least a few times before casting judgement. Cocktails could cost less, my only turn off."}
{"text":"Best pretzel in town!  The rest of their happy hour menu is awesome too.  Service is great, and staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"We sat fireside and enjoyed the AHI Poke Bowl (tuna was fresh-Chula
seafood) and Short Rib Nachos.  The cheese on the nachos stayed consistently warm throughout the duration of the meal.  Lauren our server was the best, she was super attentive and gave great recommendations."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Porch for the first time this evening. The valet was nice but the atmosphere was loud chaotic. We were still really curious about the food so we decided to stay. We were seated quickly and our server was bubbly. My husband ordered a beer and we both requested water. The beer came but the water did not. Our waitress asked if I wanted a water, I again said yes. My husband finished his beer and still no water. I went to the bar to get it myself and when the waitress saw me waiting for service at the bar she rushed to get a glass to the table. The food was great, but the service and atmosphere left a lot to be desired. We really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately we will not be back."}
{"text":"There were a lot of great things about this place, but I would say the food was mostly average. I really liked the atmosphere with the restaurant flowing into the giant porch. It felt very comfortable. I also really liked the chairs for the high tops. They were very comfortable and the same chairs were around the bar. Overall the food didn't stand out. We had fried pickles, a burger, and fries. I'd say the burger was a bit dry, but I still enjoyed it. The fries were described as shoestring but they were not very thin, just normal fries. Regardless, they tasted good. The waiter provided good service but it was sparse. He only came to take our order and pick up the plates. If he had returned we would have asked for waters in addition to our drinks. Also, we didn't really get any napkins, that would have been nice. Overall  a great atmosphere, mediocre food, and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Holly SH!t the waffle battered wings are orgasmically amazing. Service is great and friendly, a new Phoenix favorite!"}
{"text":"I wanted this to be so awesome but it failed on every level.  Made reservation for 12 and they put us all at 1 picnic table (comfortably seats 8, not 12 for sure).  They were out of Prosecco and Hefeweizen, both of which we ordered so had to order something else.  Ordered food and they  forgot one of the kids orders and two of the adult orders came out totally wrong.  Basically they have a long way to go to get their food and beverages right!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Good food. Good drinks and good atmosphere! Great addition to Arcadia"}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times since they opened a couple months ago. Each time I come it gets better. More and more people are finding out about this spot and the neighborhood bar vibe is excellent! This is the perfect addition to this Arcadia/Biltmore area. Thank you for offering a little bit of everything; a swanky atmosphere, variety of spirits, outdoor/indoor, delicious food even strawberry shortcake, entertaining games, 70's/modern like decor setting, spacious open layout with circle bar great for interacting and engaging with others, valet parking, happy, smiling employees, and so on. This is my new go to place and I can't say I've had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"Stopped in once and it was super fun.  The outdoor area is pretty cool.  Tried the fried pickles and fries as a quick snack on my bad day and it was really good.  Not greasy and very tasty.  Staff was nice and the service was prompt, even on a busy day!  Glad they opened in our hood!"}
{"text":"Let's get straight to the point! Walked in, they said it was a 30 min wait no big deal. Fast forward an hour and a half we get a table after my wife went to the hostess and asked where we were on the list, and she replied\"i can just sit you here\"  got a table and sat there for 20 min before a server came over to us. The server takes our order, and my wife asked for the salad with thousand island dressing and he says \"our thousand island dressing is amazing\" food comes out about 15 min later and my wife tried the salad and stops eating because the dressing is too spicy. She tells the server I don't think this is thousand island it's too spicy and he said oh ya we don't have thousand island so I brought you the closest thing to it. Smh this is the worst place on Indian school and isn't anything special, so don't waste your time or money. I truly don't expect much when a place is opening for the first time, but this was the worst customer experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"I hope they just sell the property. The drinks are like a college dive bar and those Chinese takeout boxes look so unappetizing. Food is terrible. How do you spend so much on the fixtures and design and completely drop the ball when it comes to food and drinks. It's like those things were a complete after thought. No heart or  soul. Service is terrible too, they all need to be trained on service etiquette."}
{"text":"I have to give it to the Porch! My first experience was far from perfect, but they have really worked on their customer service. Kalie, behind the bar, is friendly and went above and beyond to please our small group!

The bar is comfortable and fun. There were groups doing beer bongs out of the cutest flamingo! With the open-air floor plan, the games outside and the beer bong flamingo, this place really does feel like a porch party.

The food was never the problem, but everything was delicious. The twice baked wings were even better the second time! I can't stop thinking about them and being paired with a beer suggested by Kalie - it was perfect!

I'm confident the Porch will be part of our neighborhood for years to come and I can't wait to be part of it's success!"}
{"text":"The downsides: overpriced food, limited menu, very slow and inconsistent shoddy customer service. THE MOST RECENT TIME I WENT, I, TOO, NEVER RECEIVED A TEXT FROM THE HOSTESS (just like another fellow yelper). Disappointed- I wanted this gig to be wonderful and exciting for my hood. 
The plusses: Great decor, prime location...I want to compliment more, but it would be a stretch"}
{"text":"Came in around when they opened at night and had a great time that evening. Finally came back in for brunch and the atmosphere is awesome, great food, great priced drinks and service to match! Fun games - bags and darts. Definitely recommend and will be back again soon! *****"}
{"text":"OMG!! What can I say...Fabulous!!!! Have been driving by curious about the Porch! Well, my gal pal was celebrating a Birthday and requested we try that establishment...Super! We arrived at about 3:30 Thank Goodness cause it's a hopping little spot with a small parking area. Our server Jamie was so welcoming and eager to discuss the menu & restaurant!! We sat outside on an Amazing day and throughly enjoyed ourselves. Great Happy Hour menu for Beer & Nibbles!! We had the poppers and pretzel with fondue!! Both were delicious! We later decided to split the burger that was a happy hour special as well- so yummy!!! It felt like hanging out at a Pals Porch...I loved it and will bring my friends!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I had driven past before and decided we would try it the next time we were on that side of town. 3 weeks ago we went on a Saturday night- we were seated right away and put in orders for drinks- the drinks came and the beer was warm- asked for a cold glass and took at least 15 minutes to get one. Food was ok- I had a rice bowl and it was decent, he had a burger that he said he's had better. He paid via credit card and we left. Two days later, his credit card company contacted him saying The Porch was trying to submit a charge for $10 more than the bill. Mind you, we're very generous tippers and left a decent tip with the bill, but they tried for more. He called and spoke to a gentleman who stated he would see a credit within 48 hours. 5 days later, still no credit so he called again, another guy answered the phone, took down his name and CC# and stated he submitted the credit right then- 2 days later, nothing. He ended up having to submit a dispute to the credit card company and got the credit immediately. Will never go back and will NOT recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I live in Arcadia so I was excited to have a fun new cool sports bar with hopefully better than average sports bar food. I arrived around noon last Sunday the 3rd, I had trouble finding the NFL game I wanted to view, I did find a small vignette sitting area with two TV's, a gentleman that I assumed was in management, was kind and courteous and quick to switch one of the two TVs to my game. Shortly there-after, I was approached by a second gentleman, I assume another manager, he ask if I would relocate to the bar, he would then turn my game on one of the many TV's in that area, because he mentioned he had a large party that was waiting to be seated and he could put them in the area where I once was, I noticed 10 minutes later it was actually 2 people, and remain 2 people for the remainder of the time I was in the establishment, which was about an hour and a half. In this area there were two flat-panel TVs and enough space for 6 individuals, I easily could've stayed where I was, and the couple that replaced me at this location would've had adequate privacy.
I ordered a bloody mary from one of the female bartenders, a gentleman bartender asked me why I don't like bacon, not knowing what he was referring to, I replied, I love bacon, he said \"oh they forgot the most important garnish\" and he placed a nice strip of bacon in my beverage. I asked the same male bartender if he could describe the different wing sauces to me and he said he had not tried them and didn't really have enough understanding to give me a description, I went ahead and ordered wings with one of the different and unique sauces, it took about 45 minutes to receive my order and once I receive them, they were lukewarm at best. Once I received my guest check I noticed one of the bartenders had taken her discretion and given me Tito's for a $2.00 up charge, which I did not request Tito's, The bill was adjusted.
By the way, Windsor, St. Francis The Vig, & many establishments on Sundays do some great bloody Mary specials and even have bloody mary garnish bars, food for thought!
I understand you're new, I've owned two businesses, but I always looked at my business in this scenario, if I were a hospital, I couldn't merely say \"oh we're new, sorry we killed the first 30 people, give us a few weeks and will get it right\". I think you have to get it right the day you open the door, this is why George Beale and the Hillstone restaurant group is so extremely successful."}
{"text":"Logan was awesome, food was great and music was the best. Would totally comeback great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was there on Sunday, December 17th with some girlfriends. I had high expectations, but the food was lacking (both in volume and taste). First... when HALF of your menu is unavailable you should notify your guests upon seating them. It wasn't until after our server brought us drinks that she told us that ALL of the tacos were off the menu and that the preztel bites were out and ALL appetizers that had some form of meat had been switched with what was available. Second... as I had to switch my order last minute (I wanted tacos), I settled on the bruschetta. It was eh. Very bread heavy and was barely room temperature when arrived and cold by the time I finished. 

One last thing... It was cold on Sunday (we were there around 7 p.m.) and they had the sliding glass doors open. This made for a VERY uncomfortable dinner... we were ALL freezing."}
{"text":"Went here for some brunch with a couple girlfriends on Easter Sunday ... We arrived around noon and the patio was full, but we got a booth inside just fine.  Service was prompt and friendly. Friends shared a bottle of bubbly with juices.  I ended up getting a cocktail called the Antioxidant which was insanely delicious... Absolut, Veev acai liquor, berries, mint, ginger beer ... A winner!  Also pleasing was that I was able to get the avocado protein bowl and sub in more veggies for the eggs, which made the dish vegan. Woohoo!  I always ask really kindly if there's any butter or if it would be an issue to make the dish vegan, and the server was great about it.  It was a bowl of veggies, potatoes, house-made sriracha, avocado and couscous. Loved it.  Probably one of the better and fresher food dishes on the menu.   All in all, good experience!"}
{"text":"Update: My first review of the porch was not great because they were still in opening stages. 
This is my 4th time here and I'm happy to say service has definitely improved. This time I came for brunch and was happy to get Logan again for my server. He is always in great mood."}
{"text":"Pros: Great location, fun games, good food. Cons: the staff are severally undertrained and inexperienced. Visited the Porch 5-6 times in the last 8 months and the results are always the same. Slow service, staff on their cell phones half the time, inexperienced bartenders, hostess who have no idea what their job is. At this point you have to blame the mangers and hiring staff for putting people in these positions. Either they're trying to save a buck or the don't have a clue. There no way they can't take note of the terrible service."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have you in the neighborhood love this place great food great drinks amazing customer service"}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend for lunch & we were excited to try The Porch. Terrific concept-neighborhood hangout/sports bar-with fun front yard of artificial grass, retro-y red & white outdoor furniture & lawn games. Lots of tvs that hubby will like. D, a vegetarian, said she was starving and ordered 2 kinds of bruschetta & a side salad. I ordered the fig and goat cheese salad. While the plump burrata w/ pesto bruschetta looked amazing, D couldn't get a knife through the rock-hard bread part. As the other bruschetta was scorched black, she didn't even try to tackle it so asked the very nice waitress to send it back. Another order came back quickly, this time not so blackened but the crust was just as impossible to bite that D was afraid she'd crack a tooth. Thankfully, that was taken off our bill. Her dinky side house salad for $5 was served in such a small little bowl that made it awkward to eat. Meanwhile, my salad had beautiful little fresh figs on a bed of greens with pickled red onions and little pea-sized lumps of white cheese that really tasted like bland feta rather than \"goat cheese.\" Guess I was expecting larger clumps of creamy, tangy goat cheese. I know feta sometimes is made with sheep's and goat's milk, but it's not the same as \"goat cheese.\" Size of salad & ingredients not worth the $12. Felt bad that D went away still hungry, but I'm willing to try again in the future."}
{"text":"Kennedy is great!!!!!!! Loooovvvveeeee the $15 bottles of champs! The food was also really good! I had chicken tenders in the buffalo sauce with truffle fries & I can't wait to have them again. Someone with me had the chicken wings dipped in waffle batter & said they were the best wings they had ever had. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really great food for happy hour. Only bad thing was cheese for pretzel dish was kind of cold. Service was great but it got super busy so it tapered a little. Understandable. We sat at the bar. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix on vacation from Nebraska and had Logan as a server. He was so attentive and had fun with our group. We were at many other restaurants/bars while on vacation and this experience topped them all! Big shout out to Logan and the porch staff! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a new spot in the neighborhood. The food is ok, left much to be desired. Ordered the Az Green Chili Burger. Had no flavor and needed more seasoning. Beer selection is good. Waiter got upset that we asked for separate bills but if you have any common sense you would know that 3 single dudes don't want to be on the same bill. I would go here more for the bar experience definitely not the food. If you like trendy superficial places this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great titty bar! If you're looking for a place to bro out and watch intoxicated women in crop tops flash their tits then this is the place for you! The management has the situational awareness of a hibernating polar bear and will continue to pour shots for people who are obviously way too drunk and will do nothing when those people throw drinks in your face. As long as they get good reviews and likes on IG their completely happy with the outrageous behavior of their guests."}
{"text":"Logan is the man!!! He provided great service and was so attentive to our needs. Thanks for everything! Will come again."}
{"text":"Here with the girls, cool hangout! Logan is def the best thing going on tonight! The music is a little too loud for good conversation, the food was a 6/10 not a fan of thick tortillas but the shrimp was great!! Next time we want to sit in the porch!!"}
{"text":"Yikes- I really don't see this place lasting much longer with all the other great places in the area!  It's getting 1 star for decor/ambiance/location.  I should have checked the yelp reviews prior ugh.  Stopped by for lunch today with my husband. The place was about half full.  Nothing on the menu really caught my eye (sign #1 we should have just left), the waitress was very attentive but when it came time to order, she informed us that about half the menu was unavailable bc they were in the process of redoing it (sign #2 we should have just left, would have been nice to know when we sat down), ok, needed a few more minutes to decide what we were going to have instead, we decided on a fondue and pretzel app and to split a Rueben sandwich.  She came back and when we ordered said 'oh wait we don't have the pretzel fondue either' ok soo we ordered jalapeño poppers and a Rueben and my husband ordered a beer.  Our food ended up coming out at the same time (ok fine we didn't specify that we wanted the appetizer as an app) but my husband never got his beer.  We ate our food, bottom bread of the Rueben was soggy and the waffle fries were really oily, the poppers were really good.  When the check came the beer was included, the waitress was pretty upset that we never got the beer (she obviously didn't forget it, the bar did), it got that taken off.  

If this was my restaurant and I was in the middle of a huge menu re-do, I would have managers walking around all day to each table to talk to people, apologize, maybe talk about the new exciting things that will be on the new menu, maybe even offer some sort of free appetizer, something to get people to come back once the new menu was out."}
{"text":"Logan was OUTSTANDING!! It's so refreshing when a great atmosphere and eclectic vibe combine with top-notch service. As if that wasn't enough, the fresh food and $15 bottles of champagne really put the icing on the cake. What a great first impression!

We have since been back, and specifically requested Logan. Unfortunately, he wasn't working that day. Food and drinks were very good though!"}
{"text":"I came back to The Porch last night after visiting one other time in December when they first opened. It was busy because of March Madness. I provided my cell phone when I checked in with the hostess but I never received a text when our table was ready. I also didn't love how many dogs were there. I just feel like it is should maybe be in one designated area. As I was eating dinner, a dog walked under my chair and licked my leg. It was just weird as I was trying to have dinner. I was also disappointed in their nachos this time. They were much smaller, much less meat, and it basically had some white sauce and a little bit of meat. The chips were also stale."}
{"text":"Super pumped they came to this neighborhood, however we don't need just another bar. Make something we don't have. The only thing I found decent was the service. They have 300 employees but they all want to charge double. Really... chicken fingers with a side of ranch and buffalo, two double WELL Vodka sodas= $66 buck.  Hahahaha they charged me $4 for a side of ranch and buffalo. Each drink was $20. This place is a joke and that is HWY robbery. Why would anyone go there. *** Hey owner!!!!*** We aren't dumb, go rip someone else off!"}
{"text":"Typical Arcadia trendy place. Good happy hour. Service at the bar was poor. Had to ask the bar back for a drink."}
{"text":"My wife was nagging me to try this place ever since it popped up last year. 
From the outside it looks vibrant and inviting especially at night when it's lit up.
My better half had the fish tacos which she loved, fresh fish and ingredients used and a generous but not over generous portions served (perfect amount of food) 
However my bacon cheeseburger I ordered arrived raw in the middle ( I wasn't asked how I'd like my burger) and the bottom of the bun was soaked in grease, and not up to the standard it should have been. I sent my food back and was waiting a good 15 minutes for a properly cooked burger to arrive back at our table, by then my wife had finished and my hunger had surpassed, I asked my waiter to box it up for me to take with me.
I was given this part of the meal for free by the concerned manager, he was apologetic and seemed disappointed.
I think it was a one off Bad burger experience and I was the unlucky person that day. I ate the burger at home shortly after, it was now over cooked, I wasn't surprised maybe that was karma for the complaint. 
I haven't been back as yet, but never say never."}
{"text":"I went to have lunch today, Sunday, and was told they don't allow ordering from main menu until 1:00. I left because this info is not displayed on any menu. Either display it or allow ordering from main menu."}
{"text":"Well I have been putting this review on the back burner but today I have decided to do it now.
Myself and a friend stopped in for the first time Monday 02/05/18 afternoon and our waitress was useless. She didn't know how make eye contact with us so I had to ask a manager to put in our order. Not a good impression so far. Now we are waiting for our meal and I could understand if the inside was busy but it was the patio that was busy and well taken care of by the other staff members as our waitress was busy texting on the job.
We got our food it was very good.
Once we had finished our meal we had decided to have dessert, but that was not our waitresses wish as she walked up laid the check down and said \"when ever you're ready ladies and I said oh we want dessert and I asked for the menu and was told we only have 2 things to order and she told us and by this time I didn't care we ordered the one with cinnamon pita chips and hot apples and it was very yummy.
I requested to speak to a manager and he came over and apologized to us, I told him I will be coming back but to a different waitress."}
{"text":"Great place, great potential, excellent customer service! Hannah was a great server! Very attentive and on top of the needs and expectations of her tables! The rest of the staff seem to all work together well and pay attention to all the tables seated and not just their own.

Over all this place is very well done, I would recommend friends to come here as well as come back myself. As with any new restaurant/bar there is always room for improvement. They seem to be on the right track to making this place perfect. 

Unique food items that you most likely won't find anywhere else. As well as things that you can find anywhere but done really well.

I look forward to what The Porch has to offer in the near future."}
{"text":"So impressed by the happy hour! Delicious burger and a beer for $10. Cool atmosphere, I will definitely return.  The only issue I had was that it took a little too long for the hostess to acknowledge me when I first walked in."}
{"text":"We visited during the soft opening last Thanksgiving weekend and weren't impressed, but knew they had bugs to work out. We went back about a month ago for brunch after someone we knew highly recommended. We were not disappointed. Great service, food, drinks and love the retro/modern atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is cool in concept but in the end the food is good but pretty average. So for me, the atmosphere is the draw. The hubs and I went for drinks and snacks, I did like the jalapeño popper app. And the Reuben that we shared was meh. Nothing spesh. It was cold the day we visited so we didn't take advantage of that porch set up out front. They have a giant scrabble board which I would get into."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it was AMAZING. The pretzel was awesome and the happy hour is awesome.   Highly recommend trying the cocktails and the grilled cheese. Valentina was a great server as well, we were annoying and she put up with us."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with work people.  Cute place...love all of the retro decor and the porch is a great space.  Just too hot to sit out there at this time of year.  

I had the chicken tenders with potato chips, we also had an order of humus and a pretzel with cheese dip.  First, the appetizers were ok...the hummus was fine and everyone enjoyed it.  The pretzel was good, tender and salty and the cheese dip was really good with a mild beer flavor.

My tenders and chips were good.  I really liked the homemade onion dip that was served with the chips and the chips themselves were excellent.  Crunchy and just good.  The tenders were good as well.  The crust was not too crispy and the chicken inside was tender and juicy.  I didn't care for the two dipping sauces that came with them so asked for the ranch, which was good.

Others had the wings, the truffle fries, mason chop salad, the protein bowl, and panini.  The panini was more like a club sandwich with a trip layer...got an \"ok\" on that item.  Truffle fries were good although one order was delivered stone cold and were sent back and replaced with hotter ones.  All in all, everyone said their meals were ok, nothing spectacular.

Sorry...no pictures this time."}
{"text":"It's nice to have another place to go in Arcadia with a group of friends. My friends and I went on a Friday night for dinner. We got there around 6:30 and only waited about 10 minutes before sat. The staff was very accommodating with our requests and made sure to continuously check on us. I didn't get to try much of the food that night, but the rest of the group had no complaints. I plan to come back for brunch next time to take advantage of their rose deal!"}
{"text":"This place has been non-stop packed since their soft opening, so they've had very little time to catch their breath. My wife and I run an Ugly Christmas Sweater Bike Bar Crawl in the Arcadia area and the Porch happens to land right in our normal path. Knowing they were still in their soft opening at this time and wouldn't necessarily be prepared to welcome 65 rowdy drinkers with the Christmas spirit (that's what we'll call our drunkenness) I decided to ask the GM if he'd be okay if we came in on short notice. He didn't hesitate and said they'd love to have us.

A few days later, we rolled in to an already jam packed place on their first Saturday afternoon and everything went off without a hitch. We got a warm welcome, great service, and a great atmosphere. Reviews so far don't do this place justice and you'd know what I mean if you got to drive by the Porch every day. It has been busy every day since it opened and it's a great addition to the Arcadia area!"}
{"text":"With multiple happy hour options, an impressive menu, and an open, inviting atmosphere this is a great weekend spot. Their food surpasses typical \"bar food\" and bring a lot of great healthy options with great portion sizes. 

We had the BBQ special and it left us all very impressed. Whether your stopping through or looking for a fun day drinking place, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Three trips in and it just doesn't improve. I'm not sure I've ever had consistently bad service at a new place in my life. No care in the world from the staff, wrong food, incorrect tab ... it's almost as if the motto of the place is \"be as rude as possible to the costumer and maybe they'll come back.\" If this place is around in 8 months I'll be shocked."}
{"text":"Remember that kid in middle school whose parents bought them all the coolest things to try and fit in? And they still sucked??  That's The Porch. We've given this place 4 solid tries and have been vehemently underwhelmed each visit. If you've ever wondered where ex-bottom-tier frat brothers and desperate social sorority sisters hang out... look no further. It's as if they got lost somewhere between Mill Ave and Old Town, without a full-time job to show them the way. Service is perpetually substandard and the food is bland as can be. It is truly disappointing   as it's a complete waste of a great location."}
{"text":"My first time coming to this restaurant was Friday and I absolutely love it! The food and drinks were trendy and delicious! We went during the day and it wasn't too busy. Service was amazing! With the help of our awesome server Jamie we were able to try a couple different cocktails that she recommended all were so good! Definitely will recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's typically good service but today I went in for lunch and was not greeted for 10 minutes. I watched the server walk around on her cell phone. I was patient and waited and finally got menus. When I ordered I asked for bbq sauce. Once the food was delivered I had to ask 4 more times for the sauce. During this time my server was at a table on her cell phone hanging out with other employees... An employee was dancing on my server while I continued to wait for the bbq sauce. 

I had to get up and go to the table of employees to ask for me check. The server replied that she was now off and I had a new server because she was in a \" social media meeting \"  unfortunately I never was introduced to this new server and they never checked on my table. Customer service was extremely poor."}
{"text":"I'll start with the decent: our waitress was nice enough, the cocktail was pretty good, and the happy hour prices were acceptable*

The weird: we sat at a table with these faux Adirondack chairs which fit the style of the porch well, however the table was WAY too high for the low style seats. I am short, so the table was at my collar bone. My husband is tall, and was still uncomfortable. Seems like quite the sacrifice for style. Also seems easily fixable: lower the tables.

The bad: the food is terrible. We ordered happy hour bar snacks, and while expectations for finger food are always low, it was remarkably bad. The pretzels and fondue were definitely not house-made, but previously frozen pretzels and fondue from a can. It is easy to make a fondue, and a reasonable expectation for a restaurant to serve house made fare. The chicken tacos were edible, but the green salsa was like water. 

*If the food had been even decent, the happy hour prices would have been a fair price. However, since I can buy the exact same food at costco and reheat it as they did, I find the prices to be extortion."}
{"text":"Great place and an even better environment. I just had the wings and the french dip and it was outstanding. Would definitely recommend. The staff is very friendly and very professional."}
{"text":"Jami was the best server I've had in the Arcadia area and the most accommodating to our large party. She made us very happy with every request and made our large group feel very comfortable. We love her and will be back to the porch just because of her incredible service. From- the boyz"}
{"text":"Visited this place on multiple occasions and really loved the atmosphere! First time we went with family and sat outside on their patio & everyone enjoyed it. I had the truffle fries + short rib nachos and they were delicious. My sister and brother in law really enjoyed their fig mule, while I had the big trouble in little shanghai. I thought it was pretty clever packaging! Jess was a great server! Came back for a second time and this time sat at the bar. Props to Ty and the amazing bar staff for the awesome service and drinks. Really liked the shrimp teriyaki bowl!! I highly recommend giving this place a try! :)"}
{"text":"So much potential, with the indoor/outdoor setup and great location. The kids menu is hilarious, and helped me convince my 8yo girl to give it a shot. Potential is where it stopped... 

Was a Saturday afternoon several weeks ago. Not crowded but several tables. We got seated outside right away, and the service ended there. 2 adults and a kid sat for 10-15 minutes without anyone stopping by. Not even waters.

The weird thing is there was an abundance of servers ambling about and hanging inside by the bar. Other tables were looking around in wonderment as well. There is no way anyone here received any sort of serious training (or someone is slipping Versed into their staff meals). And where was the floor manager? There should have been one there with a bullwhip, riding herd. We finally got service when we grabbed a passing \"meallenial\" and begged for waters and service.

Our waitress was nice, if a little distracted. Drinks and food came out in decent time. Getting refills was another battle. FYI, Porch, that's how you make money--serve til people are content and turn that shit.

So, food. Was adequately prepared, but the basic betch quality of the ingredients conjured images of the Sysco truck out back delivering frozen burger patties. Nothing stood out as thoughtful, except the poached eggs on the avocado toast.

Really want to see this place step it up and make it. But if it weren't for the abundance of puppies, the nice weather, and running into some friends, we would have fled after the initial diss.

Will give it one more try if I hear there are improvements. C'mon, Porch! Rootin for ya!"}
{"text":"Finally went in to check it out.... living in the neighborhood watched this place go up so I was very happy to be able to sit on the \"patio\" on a beautiful day finally. 
I had the Porch protein and it was so good, Worth the wait! The gal who waited on us was good as well!! 
Will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Going here again today to watch the football games. Hoping for a good experience like the first time we went. Giving 4 stars just because the mixed specialty drinks seem a little steeply prices, but comparable to places like culinary dropout."}
{"text":"This is definitely a new cool, trendy bar with Arcadia vibes. 

The decor is super cute, and hipster. The bar is huge with extensive cocktails, and basically any type of alcohol under the sun. I went basic and ordered my go-to, Pinot Noir but definitely would love to come back with a large group to hang and play games.

It was a chilly night when we went, and they graciously had outdoor space heaters (and a fireplace) but the music was OBNOXIOUSLY loud. Maybe not the best place for full on conversations, but great for a casual hang!"}
{"text":"First time at the Porch! Great food, great beer and great service. Ask for Bruce he's a rockstar! Beer was never empty food was always warm. #bruce2020"}
{"text":"Love the porch! Such a great addition to the neighborhood!   This place is always packed.  Awesome spot to come with friends if you want to watch a game or even play some!  Love me the dart board in the back and the giant Jenga on the patio. 
I have gone 3 times now and services has been excellent every time. I think when they first opened they had some kinks to work out and they are good to go! 
For food we have really only done the appetizers - which the fried pickles are my jam, pretzel and fondue, and the chicken fingers. I have heard great things about the poke bowl but have yet to try.  I also have had the mason jar chopped and this was \"okay\".   Drinks are basic bar drinks nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great location and excellent food.  Architecture is interesting but definitely nice.  Fun games, comfortable seating and friendly for both adults and families.  Logan our server was AWESOME!! Thank you for a fun experience!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First time at the porch.  Gotta say .....it was a zoo!  March madness crowd was in  full swing.
Cool atmosphere and pretty good food.
Their pretzel n fondue cheese was light, crispy and delicious.
I also endorse their short rib tacos. 
Very tastey and to me.....better than the pork tacos. The jalapeno poppers n cheese were also very good.
Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great location, great space, good vibe.  I want this place to be awesome.  Right now just OK. They need to work on inventory management and service.  Went on Sunday, table of 6. Waitress told us about $15 prosecco, brut, rose, special.  Wife orders a bottle of prosecco and is informed that they are out of prosecco.  I order an IPA, yep out of that too. Strike 2.  Finally got 2nd choice of drinks and ordered food.  Appetizers come, no napkins, plates, or silverware.  Had to ask 2 different servers for napkins and plates.  Food was again just ok.  Fried pickles-good, short rib nachos-good, poppers-complete ripoff at $9, pretzel-ok.  I hope they get it together.  Too much competition on that street to not be great."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and had The Porch Burger, one of the best burgers I've had in a while! This place has a great atmosphere, my friends and I didn't even notice two hour had passed while we were playing Jenga on the patio. I will definitely be coming back here next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Location and the outside is fantastic. Food is pretty good, but just like a lot of places like this it has limited options which are very similar."}
{"text":"I went to the porch for the first time today. Everything was amazing! I asked the server to have a drink made that wasn't even on the menu and he was more than happy to do so. I had the border bowl and it was phenomenal. Logan and Allie were my servers and they had the most upbeat and positive attitude. I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Logan was the best server we could have possible had! He kept out entire group well stocked on drinks and food. We had a big group, but he kept up no problem! Awesome restaurant and great server! I judge a place by their Ruben and this one is definitely top 3!"}
{"text":"This place gets pretty crowded, as it's still pretty new to Arcadia. I like the decor. The tacos were pretty good, but the old fashioned was pretty bad. They need to work on that recipe."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ came to chill at the bar solo, no convos other then all the little cliques around.. okay service but overall a poor experience"}
{"text":"Awesome time at the porch. Christina was a great server and took care of us the entire time. She was wonderful, timely, funny, and outgoing. Pretzels were bomb."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out but was underwhelmed. The good....cocktails were great.... the bad.. the food and service was ehhhh. We had to wait and ask for everything...napkins, water, another drink. Granted the place was crowded, ppl were standing around right next to our table sitting their drinks on our table as they waited for seat. If the food was better I'd probably go back..."}
{"text":"Pretty much like most of the other reviews... Too much Scottsdale.. Below average service.. Decent food...  

We came in at 9:30pm, told to sit wherever. We picked a patio table. Waitress in a midriff took our order. Food was good, drinks were prompt. But while still eating she said \"well it's 10 so here's your bill and anything else you need you can get at the bar\".  She just wanted to close out and leave. She literally said \"If I could just get your card that would be great.\" Might come back cause it's a cool place, but your rolling the dice on service."}
{"text":"Environment is really cool. I love the vintage sportsy vibe and the high-end chairs. The fireplace is a plus. The place was surprisingly packed. It was loud and there was also decently loud music playing that I wish could have been turned down as having conversations was not easy.
Negatives - forced valet. My husband and I hate this. I get they need to fit in more people than they have parking spots for, but it's just ridiculous when their recommended self parking area is a block away and you have to cross a street to get to the restaurant.
Our waiter was so-so, we did not get a lot of attention, he only took our order and then took our plates. My drink was on the happy hour list (not a great happy hour, cocktails are $8) and it came in a reusable red solo cup. I did not like it.... I'm not paying $8 for a cocktail that looks like I mixed it in the back yard of a frat party. It was very fruity, artifically sweet, and not memorable. I envied the mason jar cocktails going by me on trays as those were much prettier.
We shared fried pickles and they were fine. The dipping sauce wasn't my favorite.
Won't be back unless they get a better priced happy hour. There are equally nice places in Phoenix with cheaper happy hours."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great food, great service!!! The atmosphere is laid back and fun and everyone is super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato home fries- YES! Great atmosphere and music. Love the red cups for drinks. Even at 3pm on a Saturday this place was full of people and energy. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday at The Porch great location The patio is well decorated.  It is however a little close to the street.   Food was solid and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour (or, happiest hour!) with my coworkers, interested to try out a place that I hadn't heard much about. Open-minded and ready for a couple drinks amidst tax season, we took our seats outside at a picnic table. 

To start, we got bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers, fried pickles, the giant pretzel with cheese, and drinks. My fig mule was just what I needed. The Besos Calientes and skinny margs were very well received by our table. We polished off the first round of apps happily (the pretzel was my favorite, but everything hit the spot) and ordered round two: more jalapeño poppers, twice cooked chicken wings, and the short rib nachos. The wings were alright, but everyone really enjoyed the nachos. 

We also jumped at the opportunity to try the tacos. One order of each: green chile pork, blackened shrimp, and braised short rib. Plus veggie tacos. YUM. All of them. 

Service throughout was great. Our girl was friendly and made sure our drinks were never empty. When my friend and I decided to share the Porch burger off the happy hour menu (with a side of the truffle parmesan fries- which I wouldn't recommend only because the truffle was REALLY strong), it came out split and on separate plates. We hadn't even requested it that way! 

Overall, we were thrilled and appreciative of everything The Porch had to offer. I can't wait to enjoy more patio drinks and eats before the temperature climbs any higher."}
{"text":"First time here and was ONLY satisfied by the food...service and management on the other hand a BIG negative and definitely ruined the experience. On a steady to slow Thursday we received below par services. Our waitress only took the time to do bare minimum while going above and behind for 2 other tables nearby. Ask for a \"SIDE\" of beans and got a small ramekin of cold beans(if that is serving size it should be explained to avoid confusion and disappointment) along with some other minor mishaps. After receiving the service we received we tipped according to service, which was POOR. Now while sitting and enjoying the rest of our drinks, management had the audacity to approach our table to ask why we left the amount of tip we left. First off, that is probably the most unprofessional way to treat a table after spending money on the FOOD and to judge off a tip that we based off of service was uncalled for and definitely shouldn't be welcome in a restaurant environment. should definitely think twice about approaching the ONLY minority table there, when in fact the main FOCUS is the Customer NOT the percentage of tip the server deserved! Remind you I am a server and knows what it takes to serve and knows what is deserved. The whole situation made our table of 6 very uncomfortable and uneasy. Any guest asking a server anything shouldn't feel like they're bothering them.. not a warm welcome accompanied by bad service.. wont be there again and wouldn't recommend unless you want some good hummus and/or your white lol"}
{"text":"I too REALLy  wanted this place to be amazing. We came during the week of soft opening (sat at the bar) and ordered the  wings. They were really good - service was pretty good.   Came back a couple of weeks later and my expectations were up a bit as I was anxious to order off the menu. Tons of servers standing around and food was \"meh\" nothing other than regular bar food. I thought the servers by now would be rock stars and no one seemed to be too interested in the few customers that were in there.  We live in the neighborhood and we're glad to see bike racks went up.  Well give it another try as we really want this place to work but there's a lot of competition opening nearby - needs to be exceptional."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a better review only because the concept is there! We arrived around 6:30 on a Sunday and they were nearly out of everything on the food menu... I get the growing pains but to run out of basic food items is a little odd...

We ordered the pretzels and cheese dip. The pretzels were clearly not made fresh as they were completely cold/still frozen in the middle (they didn't end up comping these even though we notified them). My friend and I ordered some of the chicken tenders with wing sauce (because they were out of chicken wings) mine were completely dry and the fries were the consistency of the kind you might find on the floor of your car. My other two friends ordered the chopped salad. It was literally a bed of lettuce and maybe 4 or 5 toppings. The menu said it was $12, they were charged $14 AND $4 for 2 pieces of chicken....

Services was also horrible.

Really hoping they improve and can make it work!"}
{"text":"The overall 3 star rating is harsh. The atmosphere is current and cool. The drinks are well prepared with a good selection. The service is friendly and prompt without being overbearing, even with the place being fairly empty. The Short Rib grilled cheese was very tasty with more meat than most places and with a choice of side was only $11. I chose the salad and the blue cheese dressing and it was fresh and tasty. The wings were crispy with a tasty buffalo sauce and ranch that tastes homemade. Don't believe the 3 star average from the self-proclaimed food critics."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start this off by says I love the vibe. Great TV's. The music is always good and if a big game is on it's no problem getting the sound turned on. It's not too noisy though like cold beer and cheeseburgers across the street can get sometimes where I can hear the person next to me because of the TV commercials.

Pros
1.Entertaining
2.Great staff
3. Bartenders know their stuff
4. Plenty of seating

Now to the cons.....

1. Parking but they have great parking valets
2. The food is never the same twice
3. They need another new cook cause if your cook tells you he is\"trying new things\" while your staff says yeah not sure why they changed it something isn't right.
4. Fried pickles should be sliced not whole dang pickles. ITS A JOKE. They don't cook the same way and no one else makes them that way. The skin in on the bottom of the pickle and when you bit into a whole one you pull the pickle out of the fried part and you end up with one or the other.
5. Never has the fried grilled cheese tasted the same as the first time I got it. Its either 90%cheese 10%short rib or the opposite but never a blend like a sandwich should be.

So besides the fact that the new \"chef\" cant fry a pickle or make a grilled cheese this place is great for a meet up or to catch a game."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and is likely the thing saving this place. The server was nice and did well, but definitely over worked as it was packed. The food was terrible... chicken wings split in half and our entrees were cold when we got them with no flavor. When talking with a manager we just received excuses... no the food was not worth $15 ea. Oh, and they ran out of silverware so it was tricky to cut with plastic silverware. They do serve a mean corona light, though. Hoping this is just early opening issues, may try again in half a year if they are still open. On a positive note, Santa showed up!"}
{"text":"Oh so bad. The food is horrible, like really really bad. We had five people and each person either hated their meal or would have liked it but it was stone cold. And the drinks are WAY over priced, like LA prices but on Indian School in Phoenix. It wasn't as busy as we expected but the servers just seemed so over worked and like there was no system in place. Our server was super nice but you could tell she was used to the complaints on the food which made me feel bad for her. Seriously one of the more terrible dining experiences I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"We had a really awesome experience at The Porch! We sat outside, which was plenty warm with the heaters & a very cute and casual feel. There were five of us and between us all we ordered the Caesar salad, pretzels, potato soup, Mediterranean wrap, and the wings. Everything we had was very delicious and prepared perfectly. We were also there for happy hour, which was a fantastic deal (sculpins for $4.50?? Sign us up!) I should also note that our service was top notch! I wish I had taken down our server's name because she was awesome. Very attentive (but not overly so), and had a fun and bubbly personality. Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"It's so interesting that this place has such bad reviews because I went about three weeks ago with my friend and we actually had a great time. I will say that the drinks and food are pretty pricey as I paid $12 for a jack and Coke  which to me is kind of expensive for a sports bar so beware that you may have to spend a little bit more money then you went to anticipate

Me and my friend ordered the chicken wings and the pork belly nachos. Nachos were not that great as the meat was kind of cold and I felt like it was lacking in the cheese sauce but the wings were absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend the golden barbecue wings , SO good! They were cooked really well, super tender, and the sauce was so delicious! We also ordered the hot wings which were good but not the best I've ever had. Our waiter was really sweet! He did not mess up our order and got our drinks /food out to us promptly for a Friday night! 

I definitely think that this place has great potential, as it had a super cool ambience and everyone was upbeat. After seeing all the reviews i'm a little nervous to go back because I feel like my second time might not be as good as my first but I will definitely give this place a second try!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! It's quickly becoming the \"go to\" for me and friends! There's great options on the menu for food and drink and a super cool atmosphere. I'm hooked on the wings every time! Those giant mules aren't half bad either ;)"}
{"text":"Very cool place and the vibe was just right, for a porch. Cold beer and a Cheeseburger completed the eating on \"Da Porch\" experience. Service was slower than I would prefer, but the food was worth the wait.
Parking can be a challenge so look carefully for the driveway entrance on the side of the building..."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Just wish I could bring my own beer and food. Why? The food is horrible and like most reviews, the beer isnt cold. Service is terrible. I waited at the bar for 10 minutes until the bartender even looked at me. Didnt help either that our bartender told us he had been puking during his shift because he had too much fun the night before. 

Lastly the bartender didn't use an ice scooper, just dipped the glass with his bare hands into the ice. Pretty nasty."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back here! The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting, also I called before we arrived and the waitress was extremely friendly and informative.  We started with the porch poppers (jalapeños with smoked cream cheese) and the giant pretzel with fondue, so filling we couldn't finish the pretzel, so yummy. Our server, Jamie, was super sweet and very attentive even though it was busy. We ordered the burger (perfectly done!) and it came out on two plates cause we didn't want a whole one. 
      Super relaxing chill place, and we left about 6 pm and it was getting crazy busy. The food is great and they have an awesome beer and wine menu. The service was outstanding:)"}
{"text":"Looking for a night filled with good music, cornhole (not bean bag toss for all your haters), delicious protein bowls, and birthday's for forty year old frat guys?! Then the Porch is the right place for you. I went on my first date in five years yesterday and it was definitely worth the wait. As we got seated, MY DATE GOT TO LITERALLY SIT ON A SWING. That's win number one for me. After we were seated, our waitress was attentive, nice, and helpful. I ordered the Porch protein bowl and I could feel the GAINS coming every time I took a bite. My date got the seizure salad and loved it. That's win number two. After finishing dinner, we proceeded to play cornhole. I took this as an opportunity to try and teach my date the way of the corn. But little did I know she was a natural. Girl straight cornholed three in a row at one point, definitely destroying the confidence in my game. That was the only L I took all night. Overall, the Porch provided me with a first date experience I will never forget! Moral of the story: never underestimate how good people from Indiana are at cornhole. You will instantly regret it. #GCUGAINTRAIN"}
{"text":"Unless you want the \"part owner\" to practically fall onto your table from being so belligerently drunk, and then try to fight your friend, don't come here. We just came to watch our favorite team, have some drinks, eat some food, and we felt like we were back at a sloppy college bar. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"The place is really cool and the bar is great. We put our names on the waitlist to be called for outside seating. In the meantime, we found a spot at the bar. Lucky we did. We were never called to tell us our table was ready. We told the manager and they compt us a beer. Really? You would just expect better."}
{"text":"Slooooooow service; food is avg to above avg.For such a simple menu, you might expect better execution. The Carolina reaper sauce was a hit but by no means overly hot."}
{"text":"Nice out door and open area seating.  Not the greatest service. Food was decent. We will give it another try and post the review."}
{"text":"Great spot to chill, our server Bruce was super cool we really liked him. Yummy food and drinks  100% would recommend"}
{"text":"First the positive, fun vibe lots of nice looking people the service was great waiter was cutie white boy with a beard . Drinks were good and so was the food. BUT my negative food is a little overpriced, and the music is way to loud it was hard to have a conversation I felt like we were just yelling at each other I go places to have fun with friends I shouldn't have to compete with the music in a restaurant atmosphere. If they just tweak it and make a few adjustments this place could be the spot."}
{"text":"After seeing this neighborhood joint built over the past few weeks, I've been highly anticipating it's opening. I can honestly say, however, I was quite disappointed. 

After being seated on the patio, it took about 10 minutes to be greeted and another 10 for our waters and bar drinks to arrive. Our server was kind, light hearted, and friendly, but his service skills left little to be desired. He seemed to have several tables on the patio. 

I would describe our all round experience as \"average.\" The food was exactly as describe, good, but not great. The atmosphere was lovely, the patio was a perfect spot at sunset. I may consider giving The Porch a second chance in a few months, hopefully they'll staff themselves a bit better and work out their new restaurant kinks."}
{"text":"Come see Josie!! She hooks up the flamingos and bottles!! Great drink specials too on sundays!"}
{"text":"DOG FRIENDLY!! It's a super cute place with bench swings! We had the jalapeño poppers which were different from the Midwest aka not breaded  but they were sooo good! The cougar bait was good (drink). Our server was very nice!"}
{"text":"I have been very excited to try this place out, since I live right in the neighborhood. So today I went in for lunch and it wasn't too busy which was nice. 
   The atmosphere is nice, plenty of room with big booths and table sitting inside and out. The bar also has great seating with comfy chairs which is always a plus. 
  The service was a bit slow considering it wasn't busy. The server was friendly but in the beginning was very attentive. Food came out promptly which was great. 
  The food was delicious! To start we order the nachos (there was only two of us) and it was a big plate. The chips were very crispy and didn't get soggy under the queso cheese. I love short rib and the meat was cooked perfectly, it was tender and flavorful. Definitely would order again. For the entree I had the grilled chicken panini. At first I was expecting it to be spicy because of the chipotle mayo but they must use lemon in the avocado because it had strong citrus hints. Overall pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Kennedy was the best server ever!! We had a huge a group and she was amazing and kept all of our tabs separated even though we moved around. Would come back just because of her! Also love that it's dog friend."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends for the first time last night. For a Saturday night it was energetic and seemed like a great spot it was crowded but there wasn't a wait. Parking was tight they use valet but we had taken a LYFT so not a big deal. Ordered drinks those were good and fair priced. Dj was playing place had a great vibe. The table ordered a burger, wings, the short rib nachos and a bowl. Everyone tasted everything and we all agreed the food was mediocre at best. The short rib nachos were actually kinda bad. The short rib was so dried it was close to beef jerky and it didn't look great. The service was very good I don't remember our waitress name but she was good, attentive and pleasant. I almost gave this place 4 stars because I really liked the vibe but I just think for 4 stars the food has to be good.  I would come again. Probably only for drinks with friends def do dinner somewhere else. I know this place is new so my hope is that they are still working with the menus and chefs."}
{"text":"Order the Hot Chicken!! I'm from the South, and have been to all the original spots in Nashville (Hattie B's etc.). I know my hot chicken, and this is the best hot chicken that I have had in Phoenix, AZ. Sorry Lucille's and Starlite. My fiancé had the Protein bowl and that was delicious as well. Great spot for food and drinks and a cool vibe."}
{"text":"We have eaten here on two separate occasions, both of which I was extremely let down by the service. The staff seemed uninterested and disingenuous. We waited entirely too long to be served and even longer to get the drinks we ordered. . Really just a pretentious vibe and a slack-effort staff. 

The Food was that of any other gentrified restaurant popping-up in Arcadia. 

Best part about this place was leaving."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere & good. The trifecta of AWESOME 
Fun for happy hour, dinner or brunch"}
{"text":"I took my time because the reviews were a little scary. Our experience was fab, hostess was super helpful, got our vibe and sat us right away. Lily waited on us and was five stars all the way...great cocktail menu, cold drafts for dude and we shared some short rib nachos that were above average. Atmosphere is choice, patio is awesome!"}
{"text":"I had so much fun! Scrabble, Jenga, darts... at one point a I had a cheering section (and I represented!). 
The place is pretty. The atmosphere  is neighborhood/upbeat/casual and the food is delicious. 
I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"After seeing the fantastic retro sign and open air seating, I was excited to go to The Porch. We went on a Sunday afternoon, and the weather was perfect for sitting outdoors. The place wasn't overly crowded, and we had our pick of tables. Our server was very friendly and had a great personality, but disappeared once we were served food. The pros: the outdoor area is nice, and a decent place for an afternoon beer. It is along Indian School Rd however, so when motorcycles go by, it is pretty loud. The negs: beyond the retro-themed sign and motel chairs, the place is more of a bro sports bar (if you are thinking it will be more like an Upward Projects or Genuine Concepts restaurant, forget about it). Inside has a few retro fixtures and yellow booths, but the main focal attraction is the huge bar in the middle of the hyper-air-conditioned room. Not only does the retro-theme fall short, the menu and food leave a lot to be desired. The menu selections are uninspired and pricey. My companion had a sloppy joe, which he enjoyed. Not being a meat eater and not in the mood for a salad, I selected the Poke Bowl. For $15 I received an anticlimatic bowl of flavorless white rice, a scattering of tuna, some chopped up cucumber, and some avocado. Knowing what I know now, I would have stopped by one of the countless poke restaurants in the area before going to the Porch, and spent my $ more wisely. If you go to the Porch, go to hang out with your friends to have some cocktails in the outdoor area. Don't bother with the food."}
{"text":"New place  first visit  walked out  bad service waited too long to be greeted, eight  employees standing around  manager more interested in flirting with staff  ice tea was terrible, stale no lemon or sugared offered ,menu  after I asked for it  was ok but I was so put off by the staff I did not think I would give them 12 dollars for a Big Mac   I was hoping for a new hangout in the area  this is not it  wished them good luck ( sarcasm) on my way out they said thanks for coming in a grunt and did not notice nor care I was in and out in fifteen minutes"}
{"text":"While the food and drinks were decent, the service was HORRIBLE. The waitress had the attitude of couldn't be bothered and overall had a rude demeanor. She checked in with the table very mininally the entire visit. She never refilled our waters, didn't clear our plates when we were done, completely forgot 2 of my friends drinks, and only when it was very clear that we were ready to go did she ask if we wanted to get anything else. If I hadn't worked in the service industry myself, I wouldn't of tipped her. 

The hostess and valet were prompt and polite however."}
{"text":"The food was served cold, no one acknowledged us for about 10 minutes after sitting at the bar, service was terrible. At one point there were about 6 waitresses standing around in the back laughing after I asked if my frittata was supposed to be served cold. I was really looking forward to a new restaurant in Arcadia but the porch has service one step above the service at farm and craft in old town."}
{"text":"This star isn't for the food or drinks, it's for the crappy customer service by management. 

Called today (Monday) to make a reservation for next Saturday (1/13) for a birthday party for 8 people, two of which are kids. They called me back about a half hour later saying they couldn't actually take our reservation because there's a football game that day. Um, what? We just wanted a table to come eat and celebrate and you can't take our reservation because it might be busy? That's why we're asking to reserve a table. We asked for an early reservation at 3pm. The girl I spoke with was very nice and I'm not shooting the messenger. I just find it rude that a new place in the area is turning bigger parties away because they're anticipating a big football crowd. 

The good news is there are plenty of other restaurants that we will be happy to celebrate at. The Porch won't miss us, but considering the already less than stellar reviews, maybe they should. My dad (the birthday boy) was looking forward to this place so that's a big bummer  :("}
{"text":"Tonight was our second visit to the Porch. The first visit was not great. The drinks were good and somewhat quick, but the food took forever. The manager \"apologized and said they were new and working through issues\".  Tonight my girlfriend and I decided to give them another try. We were seated right away and ordered drinks. It was nearly 20 minutes until our drinks arrived, and my drink was wrong. They quickly provided a new drink to me and then we ordered food. We ordered pork belly nachos, hummus, and wings. The food arrived in 12 minutes (quick). The order came out wrong and they agreed to correct it. The pork belly didn't taste or look like pork, but only pork is listed on the menu and not beef (I do not eat beef/cows). I kept questioning the pork, but with no beef nachos on the menu, I felt like I was eating a dry pork. It then took another 20 minutes to get a second drink - my drink was wrong, again.... The bill finally came and it said \"short rib nachos\" on the bill. I flipped and asked why they served me beef when it literally says PORK BELLY NACHOS on the menu, and was told \"pork isn't on the menu anymore\". Nobody told us that. The restaurant does not train their staff and has only one bartender to serve the entire seated restaurant. This place is a mess and I can only imagine what it looks like behind the scenes in the kitchen. I would avoid this place until they get their act together. The manager was nice both times, but nice doesn't equate to running a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"Bad reviews??? Just go and enjoy yourself, leave your critiques at home. This place has a sweet set-up. Ive never had a problem with service. Beer selection good and the appetizers I've had were great. Cool neighborhood addition. 


P.s. still miss the hot n sour soup at little shanghai r.i.p."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place. Had a great meal and our waiter Logan was the best! The fried pickles were really good. I was so surprised. Of course the porch burger is always a great choice."}
{"text":"The kitchen closes early, even for a week night (10pm). The fig mule was over priced and tasted like it was just mountain dew, not a good value for a $10 cocktail. Slow service, very long time to get a draft beer for a nearly empty place. No orange in the blue moon. All the tv's Had the same thing on, not particularly entertaining. Nice decor and good concept, just not well executed. Place was clean and new, just needs to be more customer focused if they want to compete in the neighborhood. Much better places to go just with better value."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't worth the money. With so many food options available in the area The Porch is a disappointment in comparison. The service was slow but the atmosphere is fun and worth visiting if you're just getting drinks."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience at the porch, I was racially profiled and had overall bad service, the waitress saw me and without hesitation continued to tell me that they were out of Dos Equis as if me being Mexican makes me officially interested in Dos Equis, after she saw the dislike in my face, she never directed a word towards me except to tell me my food was almost done, even though I ordered first, she came Around and asked if my friends needed a second beer but didn't even look at me, I guess if you are white, this place is great for you but if you're Hispanic I don't recommend this place. This treatment really hurt specially since I grew up in the area and this new business looked nice to me but the server ruined it for me"}
{"text":"Kerry was so great! Really great drinks, friendly service and great environment. Fun spot for dinner & drinks. Cool Retro 70s vibe."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Went 2x to hope it was a fluke but no dice. Waiter named Bruce was horrible. We live in Arcadia so love the great spots we have here.
But doubt will go back here here ever."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix doing a training class and decided to eat at The Porch. What a great place. The service from the bar tender was amazing. Never an empty glass. The food was so good, I had a Rueben with sweet potato home fries and the pretzel with fondue. Everything was fantastic. The atmosphere and restaurant set up seems like it would be a happening place in the evening. If your around give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times and definitely felt it had some growing pains. The food and drinks has somewhat improved but the vibe sucks. I was really hoping this would be a nice new addition to the Arcadia neighborhood but the evenings seem to be overrun by drunk 20 somethings on the patio. There's also bathroom attendants which really give the place a \"white privileged little crap\" kind of touch."}
{"text":"Courtney was our server for the afternoon.  She was friendly and accommodating in every way.  Thank you, Courtney. The four of us shared the baked pretzel and dip and loved it!  We will certainly order that again.  Each of us had different entrees, and were all very pleased.  Great food was the comment we all made.  We will certainly be returning and trying some of the other entrees on the menu."}
{"text":"I can't vouch for everything of the menu, but their pearl couscous protein bowl is a winner. Most places who have good bar food wouldn't have this option for clean eating, so on this meal alone they get five stars from me."}
{"text":"Ok.. so I really wanted this place to be awesome and I totally want to give new restaurants a break while they get their footing- but this was ridiculous. The food was not very good and small portions. They \"ran out\" of their ingredients to the drink I ordered - one that was highlighted on their menu. And most frustratingly- they somehow put my son's' order on a separate ticket and it took 20 minutes AFTER the rest of the food arrived and no attempt to make it right by comping, or offering a dessert for the wait. We barely saw out waitress. For a new business to mess up and not ever try to apologize to customers doesn't bode well. 

I would have given another start or 2 had the waitress been more apologetic or a manager had come to apologize. But I guess customer service is not that important.  I hope it improves."}
{"text":"This is an update to my last review after visiting The Porch initially when they first opened. After returning they have definitely improved their service and the food. I ordered the same thing as I did on my initial visit. Can you guess it?!? Wings! Wings! Wings!  This time around they were good well (last time they were cold and over cooked). I think the kitchen has finally figured it out so I'm happy I returned. 

It's a fun place to visit, they have a patio and indoor setting with a pretty nice TV set up to watch the games. Based on my most recent visit I would now recommend this place. They've stepped their game up. 

My disclaimer: The first time I visited I was with a pretty big group. This last time I was with a smaller group and was at the bar. I'm honestly not sure if that made a difference but I could tell from the overall atmosphere that they definitely figured their ish out."}
{"text":"Great place, food and our server/service was awesome! I had the Reuben with truffle fries and man, that Reuben was mouth watering and fries were good. Great atmosphere and place overall and definitely will come back."}
{"text":"The Porch is our new favorite local hangout. The wings are sooo good! All the food we've had has been really yummy.Great happy hour with good beers. Love the open ambiance. The manager was super nice trying to get the MLB game we were looking for. He said they didn't have it, but we're soon getting the MLB pkg, so should get all the games. Servers/bartenders have all been really efficient and nice. We do try to avoid coming on Friday & Sat, as it is way too loud and packed. We come during the week which has a more relaxed chill vibe. Also, always great tunes playing!"}
{"text":"Logan pours mimosas like a boss. Food is pretty good and the ambience is fun. Brunch is pretty low-key, but if you come for dinner be prepared for crowds."}
{"text":"I've never seen a place improve week after week. Hats off to the owners and management!"}
{"text":"Not a good first visit at all. Don't get the poke bowl. They have no idea how to cook rice. That's not even the worst part. Our server, she was TERRIBLE!!!! Barely spoke to us, couldn't care less about my dislike of the food, lacked any sort of hospitality, and looked like she couldn't wait to quit her job. Furthermore, you're a new restaurant fighting for sales. If I'm the manager, and I hear that someone didn't have a good experience, I'm surely going to talk to that customer.  I give them less than 6 months."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, but the food is overpriced and mediocre. My chicken was well seasoned, but dry."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic as usual, even during the peak of the NBA playoff games first time we came.   Loved the cuban sandwich,  the golden wings are usually my favorite. Both times I came my date had the French Dip Burger and its excellent.  The horseradish gives it a great kick.   If the weather is good you can sit outside or grab a table.   We found two seats at the bar on our second visit.   They have lots of TVs to see your favorite game.  Overall like the vibe and decor.  Also make sure you  leave a few extra minutes for parking since they offer valet."}
{"text":"This place is just as awesome as Bevvy. Wings are very good, great beer selection, and a really cool vibe. Above all that, our service was phenomenal. Thanks, Evelyn, for ensuring we will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Ok this was my first time here. Just passing by. (Lunch) Nice sports bar if you are into that sort of thing. Ordered my hamburger more towards the well done side came the opposite.  Didn't saying thing since it would have taken to long to fix it and everyone else would have been through eating. Being right on Indian School of course it is going to be noisy. Would recommend eating inside. Also has a dog friendly patio. I own a dog but do not like eating with him.  I will eat here again but inside this time and see what happens."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place as we go to the Bevvy a lot and get exceptional service there, sadly they didn't deliver AT ALL. First we waited 30 mins for a table which on a Friday night is expected and this place was packed! So I was hoping it was gonna be worth the wait. When we finally got seated the hostesses didn't give us enough menus we had to get up and ask for more, our table was still dirty, and we weren't greeted for over 10 mins. When the server finally came over there was no \"sorry about the wait\" or anything. We gave him our order for appetizer and asked for a round of waters, the water didn't come til after the appetizer was on the table! We ordered our food at 9:39, at 10:20 we finally asked how much longer it was gonna be. At this point the restaurant was pretty empty. Our food came out finally and it was cold and just lacking in general. Burgers were dry and over cooked, chicken panini was soggy, seemed as if the food was just sitting in the window. We kept having to ask the server over and over again for refills and he came over and dropped a pitcher on our table, like I'm sorry do you not have time to get refills we have to do it ourselves? We ended up asking for a manager TWICE. All around it was a bad experience. I probably won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Kennedy is the absolute best! She was quick, personable and very fun. The Porch is always a good time whenever I've gone"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has only 3 stars.... I was visiting over the holidays and stopped by for drinks/food with a bunch of friends. We had chicken wings were crispy and delicious, & the burger was cooked to perfection. I'm a big ranch connoisseur and theirs was awesome. Would def recommend for a group."}
{"text":"It's as if the wait staff and bartenders purposefully try to avoid eye contact with customers hoping they'll go away and not actually order a drink."}
{"text":"Food was great and so was the service! Our waitress Evelyn exceeded all expectations. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The best part of the night was the valet guy...super friendly. Thats where it ended.  We asked for a table for two. The hostess tried to put us at some ridiculous little table by the bathroom right underneath the speaker.  I refused the table and she said I couldn't  give us Any of the vacant four tops.  Best option we settled for outside. They gave us two chairs with a little rickety IKEA low table. It about fell over at least three times. We complained, but our drink girl said ....that's what we do here and didn't even offer to get us a better table. It was cold outside but there were only three heaters. Took twenty minute to get someone to take a drink order, then another 20 to get the drinks. We have still not been offered food service. Finally got our drinks......my wine was a 3 oz pour for $12. My guy got a Manhattan for $12 it was not good and only about 3 oz. Food menu is nothing special .....Salads, burgers , wings, and pork bellies. I got a burger...it was slimy...full of sauce....every time took a bite of it everything squished out. My fries were cold when I got them, But nobody ever came back to check on us so that I could send them back. When she finally came back 30 minutes later she said she would give me some new hot fries but I told her I was done eating.  She did apologize or seem to care much at all. 
We just opted for our tab and left.  When we went to retrieve our car at valet they were so busy that they brought our car up and took off to retrieve other cars. They didn't even wait for their tip.  Weird!!  The service was off the chart horrible. The menu is weird and the drink prices are ridiculous.  Even though it looks like a cool place music was ridiculously loud and there was no variety. They played a very consistent old , loud rock 'n' roll genre. I would not go back And give this place a second chance. The food was bad but the service was worse."}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious and the service was awesome. We had Jessica and she was so sweet and professional."}
{"text":"Drinks are cute. I had the Shanghai.... served in a Chinese take out box with a fortune cookie. Cute way to present a vodka red bull......i agree with others  its an expensive way to get a vodka red bull.....

The 3 star rating really comes from food. Nothing on menu thst stands out. Had short rib grilled cheese and the chicken pita. You know its okay when you ask how your date likes the food and you both agree that the soup on the side is good. 

I put in 3 stars and then asked my husband with out telling him what he would give it....he instantly said 3 stars.   

Trendy, but if they dont fix their menu, wont be there long."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with The Porch, especially considering how they handled our very large group on a Friday night. When we arrived, they had all of our tables ready for us and started serving us immediately. Our waitress was amazing, remaining patient, especially at the end when we split checks.

The food was great, from the nachos (very spicy!) to the grilled cheese (my favorite). Not to mention a fun patio (or porch, I suppose?) with giant jenga and plenty of seating to just hang out and have a drink."}
{"text":"Amazing spot to find.  Parking is a little rough but well worth it. Lots of things to do, and the patio is fantastic.  Food was spot on and so was service."}
{"text":"We were so excited for this new spot in the hood, but it turned out to be a bit of a let down. Food was awesome, despite arriving barely warm. I'm gonna guess the servers were new to the waiting game, as we were left alone for 25 minutes & the waiter never took notice that I didn't care for my cocktail. Service was really bad but I gave 3 stars because of the food. They also need to get heaters for the patio! I hope they step it up because this place could be great!"}
{"text":"I just moved over here to Arcadia and I'm trying to get my SoSco friends to love it over here too. So we decided to try the newest place in my new hood. Seated promptly, plenty of room, greeted promptly and I will say Jessica was very nice. They seemed maybe a bit overwhelmed although the place wasn't that busy. We ordered the chips and dip and was told they were out of chips. We decided on fried pickles ,which were great, and pretzels and cheese. The cheese sauce wasn't that great. All 6 of us ordered and had minor requests (no tomatoes or no sauce etc) and 2 of them were right. I would suggest telling your servers that if they're busy and have a 6 top with special instructions, to WRITE IT DOWN. No paper and pen is a 100% rookie move. Our server along with her busser kept the drinks full except for the 1 guy drinking beer at our table. Then one of our late comers ordered the poppers which said \"stuffed with smoked cream cheese\" which was not true. They were stuffed with cheese sauce and overcooked. 1 friend and I both had the french dip burger, mine had the horseradish sauce that I requested none of but she fixed it and it was just ok, the other 2 had the other burger which was like a big mac they said and 1 had the grilled cheese which she enjoyed with the chili. Nothing was mind blowing and in fact, we had 3 more people join us after we ate and we told them to go to the Vig and we left. As we were getting our stuff, I noticed a server walk by with chips and dip that we were told you were out of. I get it that they may have made more but we should've been informed of that because 4 of us had to order a different side with our meals because she said there were none."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good, beer was ok & pkg sucks! Is this the best you can do? Rather have the Asian restaurant back..."}
{"text":"The food was worth what they charged, it's not a dining experience. The mood is laid back, so much so that they don't let you know to seat yourself on a Tuesday night.

I got the Cuban sandwich which I though was tasty, my spouse ordered a salad that made no mention of dried fruit and yet it came with a lot of dried fruit which turned her off. I probably would have given it at least 3 stars if a member of the wait staff (not our specific server) didn't laugh in our faces when a little girl left a cherry stem on our table like we were supposed to take out the trash. Would have liked to leave a better review, but, I just can't."}
{"text":"Reserved a spot on the patio for a surprise party for my daughter's 25th birthday. We had about 30 people there. Kennedy was our server and did such a fabulous job! She had multiple tickets going and kept it all straight, quickly knew people's names and what they were drinking. Her service was impeccable! Thank you Kennedy! Thank you to all the servers, busters, and bartenders working that night. Everyone there helped make it a great night for all of us! Great job!"}
{"text":"The porch is a great new neighborhood spot. Great food and service. Jessica was awesome"}
{"text":"I'm all about dog friendly restaurants as I enjoy taking my pupper with me as much as possible. The Porch is a great spot for some drinks and appetizers while enjoying a fun, low key atmosphere. I have been here a few time since they opened and I can't say I have loved any of their entrees. If I were choosing solely on dinner choices, this wouldn't be a first pick. That being said, it's fantastic for the before or after drink stop."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was great and so was the atmosphere! Music was great the whole time. Our waiter Logan was one of the best I've had in Phx."}
{"text":"First time here.. kinda tired and hungover but Logan's aggressively positive attitude brought me back to life! Great place, great staff! Logan pours mimosas like a bossssaa"}
{"text":"This is my second time. Brought my sister for her 1st time. Excellent!  I had the French dip burger and hand cut chips. She had the Porch burger and fries. Everything was delicious, served hot and fast. Service by Logan was impeccable. No such thing as an empty drink. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed place. Staff very nice.  I had fig and goat cheese salad.  Omg so good."}
