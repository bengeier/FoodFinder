{"text":"Easy slow going diner. Food is inexpensive and good. Service is good.  They keep the coffee filled and it has a nice diner feel."}
{"text":"a cleveland staple! excellent hot dogs and breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff but the restaurant had a dirty feeling, the bathrooms were very dirty . Low quality food but excellent price. We had two adults and four children and the bill was $26.  The coffee was nothing special . Would not return."}
{"text":"Meh. Went late on a Monday morning for a Western omelette. Prices are slightly lower than most of the surrounding diners, plus they are one of the few 24-hour diners in the area. The food was decent. The service was just slow and unforced. Plus, I think I oversaw a sign about a cap on coffee refills? What is that? I didn't ask for my 2nd refill because I didn't want to wait around for it anyway."}
{"text":"Really good food for the price. We ate there every day when we visited family in Cleveland. The chili dogs are great, and so are the breakfast scrambles."}
{"text":"24-hour dive joint. Great substitute for fast-food chains after a few drinks, or for breakfast. Service is speedy, and polite. 

Atmosphere: Better than your average dive. Very bright and cheery (buzz-killing...but in a good way, like, I need some food and light to de-drunkify myself). Clean. Feels like you're eating in someone's kitchen, not in a basement. 

As for the food, you get what you pay for. Roughly five bucks for an all-out breakfast accompanied by bacon, sausage, hash browns, eggs and french toast? I'll take it. 

Bonus: if you go in there after hours, you can laugh at all the drunks for amusement."}
{"text":"This was a little gem of a find while on my way to work one day, The food is excellent and the price is the best value out there.  Do yourself a favor and try it if you haven't already. Its a 24 hour diner, but the wait staff treats you like they wish it wasnt. had a bit of a wait for a simple egg omelet and home fries, ( i know they are known for their hotdogs but it was 8am), the clerk kept apologizing for the wait which made the situation a tad better. The food was actually really good, the home fries with seasoned peppers and onions, the omelet had an abundance of bacon and cheese, perfect for me to start the day with. Its small inside, they have an outside patio too with like 3 tables so i wouldnt suggest a big group for this place. Its hidden and very easy to miss but if you want a quick good and awesomely priced breakfast this is the spot!"}
{"text":"This place is average, diner food with ok service. It must have been obvious we were from out of town, we were looked at a touch different than the locals. Our sofa and coffee were not offered to be filled till we were done and the server was setting the check on our table. The food is ok/decent. The food is purchased from a distributor. The sausage gravy, from a can, the biscuits it's on, again probably frozen from restaurant depot....bland and very little flavor! The hash browns were under browned kind of like grated hot potatoes....gross! The omelette was ok, the toast barely toasted? It is what it is a diner that is open 24hrs. A day! Cheap and fast, probably a great stop after a long night of drinking...when you will eat anything...lol"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, bacon cooked to perfection, very friendly staff, food came quickly and pancakes were huge lol my pancake living teenage son couldn't finish his third pancake, he said they were fluffy and filling. My sunny side up eggs were nearly perfect, my only thing that the hash-browns potatoes were a bit dry and these are not really home-fries as listed on the menu. However that maybe a difference in names in different states. 
This place is kid friendly and when we asked for milk for our baby it arrived promptly. Will come back again if we are ever in Cleveland again"}
{"text":"I love good divey diners. And this place does not disappoint. Had the Philly cheese and some fries. Great place to grab a bite and good service too. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Cute little local spot. Great prices and decent food. My husband and I loved going there for late night snacks when we were dating!"}
{"text":"Great 24 hour spot. I love their burgers and fries. Portion sizes are generally pretty small so it's not infrequent that I get two orders. Plus it's inexpensive enough to where that's still cheaper than 1 meal at another restaurant. Great food and service, and the waitresses will remember your name the second time you go. (Especially if it's the 3rd shifters)"}
{"text":"Food: I had the Philly cheese with a side of chili cheese fries. Excellent portion and very good food. No complaints. 

Atmosphere: Quiet and clean 

Price: Very good for the portion size 

Several people came in while I was there and it quickly became evident that they had regulars. The two ladies behind the counter remembered their names and what they usually ordered. Made for a very comfy atmosphere. 

Came here on a recommendation and I was not disappointed. Will be returning."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! Disgusting and dirty. Major fruit fly infestation. Kitchen is ridiculously filthy. Service is bad and they use a lot of canned products. Hot dogs are Sugardale hotdogs that taste like balogna."}
{"text":"Classic diner! good coffee. excellent breakfast. cheap prices. and nice people! every town needs a diner like this!"}
{"text":"Overall this place needs to shut down for a day to do a deep clean. Even though they are open 24 hours, I know staffing issues happen and cleaning routines go south. 

Got the 2 eggs deal for about $4. Eggs were perfect over. Sausage was better than expected. My only real complaint is with the potatoes. I know they were made and held, which is perfectly ok. However they weren't reheated very well. Gyro omelette ($5?) was unexpectedly good. 

Service was attentive and knowledgeable. Breakfast for 2 under $15 can't be beat."}
{"text":"Diner experience. 

Very nice staff. I mean VERY nice. Which is refreshing considering most people nowadays are not. The owner even came to our table to say hi 

Food was very very good and reasonably priced. My husband had the southwest skillet and I had the ham and cheese omelet. 

The bathrooms are kinda old and nasty but the rest of the place was clean and nice. 

They homemake their spaghetti sauce, chili sauce, soups......We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love it!  Huge food selection and attentive service.  Food is priced right and selection is huge.  Chili dogs are among the best in town and a carryover from
The Lorain Road selection.

Clean and updated so nice for everyone."}
{"text":"This place. Where the heck else can you get a BLT for $2.65?? How can you beat that? The prices are cheap, the food is good and greasy. Everything you could ever want and get 24h/day when you're hungover (or still hammered), and you even lost your wallet."}
{"text":"certainly not 5 star cuisine in terms of fancy ingredients but rather for its simplicity .. 5 star service as well .. this is a hot dog joint plain & SIMPLE .. standard order is 1 kraut+ yellow mustard dog + 1 chili+ cheese dog + 1 chili+slaw dog .. also I cannot go w/out an order of fries w/brown gravy .. expect some beefy goodness in that gravy .. nearly a meal by itself .. simple food for sure but it never disappoints .. but sometimes simple is simply BEST .. (miss the original on Lorain Ave. that was destroyed by fire .. had gone there w/my dad when I was a kid .. but give this location a try .. staff is the same as it was on Lorain Ave. .. always friendly!)"}
{"text":"Steve's is what you'd expect from a 24 hour diner. I ordered the gyro. It was a little light on meat but decent quality and $4.00.

The tea is fresh brewed and, contrary to some of the other reviews I read, I found the place cleaner than average."}
{"text":"Yummy! Love just about everything except for the wait for my order to be taken. Everything is cooked perfect. The cook does an awesome job I must say!"}
{"text":"I have revisited Steves Im gonna give them 5 stars because I had a phenomenal breakfast and it was great . My wife had some chili dogs. And onion rings my daughter loved . I had interaction with owner and he cares about this business so if theres a problem please address it they will take care of you . I previously rated at 3 stars but stand up business !!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday 5pm 

Craving chili-cheese dogs and was near to Steve's. 

$2.30 for one hot dog when I ordered it with just chili and cheese. Seemed like the hot dogs had been kept in hot water before landing in the bun, because the seam was soggy - not overall chili dog sloppy, but sticky wet wonder-bread soggy. 

Next time for my money, I'm going to the hot dog place on Lorain Ave @ 41st by my house where I can get 3 dogs for $5."}
{"text":"Can't decide on where to eat?
Go here!
This is one of our family's favorite places. Full menu 24 hours a day. Great selection, so there is something for everyone. Prices start off really low. 
The coffee is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Chili Dogs are my main reason to come here! I can easily say they're the best I've tried in the Cleveland area with out question! I go at least once a week and will contiune to do so. Steve's rocks!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a taste of a local spot in town and a quick bite to eat after a long night. Walking in, we were immediately greeted by great service. The resteraunt was diner style and family like. There were many locals eating and having good conversations. 

We sat and had great service, the woman who served us knew we were from new York and told us about her last trip to NY, she was nice and recommended what we should have. 

Our food came out fairly quick and was okay. I had fry chicken and tater tots. The fried chicken was AMAZING they gave me four bug pieces and a side of home fries. The home fries weren't as great as I hoped so I didn't eat it  my boyfriend had a burger, it was just a basic burger. Their prices were very cheap. Our entire meal was $14 including drinks which wasn't bad. 

There was a huge parking lot, the place was clean and in a good area. 

It was nice getting a taste of a local spot."}
{"text":"Nice lil diner. Service was fast and friendly. 
Super cheap! My whole bill was $9.50. 
I ordered a 2 egg w bacon and potatoes, French toast, coffee and another coffee to go.
Holy cow, a lot of food! Bacon was thick cut and awesome. Would prefer a little crispier but my fault for not ordering that way. French toast was awesome! Best I've had in a long time.
Usually at these type of restaurants coffee is an after thought. This place has great coffee to compliment the food. Great experience. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Where to go when u worked 8 hr catering shift? Husband found this place and got here midnight. 24/hour diner. Can choose from breakfast/lunch or dinner items.  The prices. Wow so beyond affordable and tasty. Husband ordered Steve's big one. 2 sausage 2 bacon toast, pancakes, hasbrowns  and eggs.7.99 for all that food.  I ordered 2 eggs, 2 bacon and toast and hasbrowns $3.50.   We will definitely come back and would recommend this mom and pop er Steve's diner  over a chain."}
{"text":"Service has went seriously downhill just had a white hair in my food and they didn't even care. Obviously my hair is brown... quite nasty didn't even apologize"}
