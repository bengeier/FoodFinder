{"text":"I came here with a couple people to join some friends who were already here. After we joined them at the table the bad service began. Not only were we never even greeted by our server, but we were ignored long enough for each of us to take a turn reading in full the one menu that had been left on the table. Finally after what had to be at least 20 minutes we succeeded in flagging down the server to take our orders. When we could get her to come to the table she was nice enough, she just wasn't very observant leading us to have to flag her down more often then I care for. 

The food itself was ok. It tasted fine, like most standard pub fare, there was just nothing memorable about it. After we had finished our server informed us that she was finishing for the night and would have to bill us out. We wanted to order some more drinks and dessert, but since she hadn't offered this option we decided we would order from the next server. 

At this point a band was setting up so we moved to a further table so it wouldn't be too loud to talk. Well the service in the new section made me feel like I was dining in the ritz before. After we finished what beer we had left we waited for our server. Not only did she never greet us, but I had the pleasure of watching her \"work\". She would visit one table, always walking with her eyes cast down so I couldn't catch her attention, and take their order returning to the bar to wait for the drinks to be made, then delivering them. This continued at the slowest pace possible, and not once did she look up at any other table while taking care of the one she was dealing with at that moment. I watched as three separate tables sat down, grew tired of never being served and left. Eventually I checked the time stamp on my bill from our previous table and was shocked that we had been waiting for 43 minutes without even being looked at. And with that we saw ourselves out to find a place that actually wanted our business. 

I am graciously giving pub Saint Paul one star because they do have a wonderful view of the water since they have large open windows and are situated on the second floor. But I can only suggest sitting there if you don't mind a dozen loonie sized spiders building webs over your head and periodically coming down to run on the table or nest in your hair. 

After my experience, the only possible reason that I can understand why the standards are so abysmally low here is because the management and staff want to get the pub shut down as fast as possible. If this is the case they should keep up the bad work and they will reach their goal soon. As for my friends and I, never again."}
{"text":"Place vide et la music joue super fort .... meme trop fort pour le rien . Tu te crie ds les oreille toutes la soiree!"}
{"text":"Great service from Philip the entree is not that spectacular but it did come with soup and coffee or tea. Great view though of the waterfront."}
{"text":"C'est une incontrôlable envie de dévorer un hamburger qui m'a fait gravir les marches en bois de ce très populaire (l'un des plus fréquentés du Vieux-Montréal) resto-bar. Je me suis dit qu'il devait y en avoir, puisque la place est reconnue pour son vaste choix et ses gargantuesques portions au rapport qualité/prix raisonnable. C'était un lundi en début de soirée, probablement l'un des rares soirs sans ambiance, car hormis un habitué, affairé à boire son pichet et draguer la barmaid du bar central, et deux hommes en souper d'affaires, j'étais pour ainsi dire seul; un éclairage à peine efficient et une télévision en sourdine.Curieux de ne pas y voir un chat, je demande aux serveuses si c'est comme ça tous les soirs... Elles me répondent d'un fou rire qu'elles peuvent compter sur les doigts de la main des soirées aussi «relaxantes».

Mon cheeseburger a, comme on dit, bien rempli ma panse. Une bonne boulette cuite sur le grill, couverte d'une tranche de fromage cheddar blanc, accompagnée d'une montagne de frites, salade de choux et cornichon. Il ne me restait plus qu'à bourrer mon repas de condiments et le dévorer goulûment. Je l'ai mangé tranquillement, en bordure de la fenêtre donnant sur la rue Saint-Paul, celle-ci déjà endormie dans le froid glacial... L'autre côté du restaurant offre une vue sur le Fleuve Saint-Laurent.

Chaque vendredi et samedi soir, ce vieil immeuble (datant de 1875) est l'hôte de spectacles musicaux de tous genres, aux prix très abordables. Les autres soirées sont animées par des événements variés, tels les fameuses joutes des nos glorieux Canadiens de Montréal. En de pareilles circonstances, la quille de Molson Export ne coûte que 6$... Pour ma part, la seule bière décente que l'on y trouve se résume aux Trois-Mousquetaires....

Dans l'ensemble, c'est pas mal..."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is horrible, except may be the location. Service is terribly slow. Their cocktails have no sign of alcohol!!
Food was mediocre at best. It takes a lot of work to mess up fries and they do it.
Anyways, if you have nowhere to go, this is your last resort in the old city."}
{"text":"great pub! kid friendly too, though we were here for a late lunch. poutine was decent, but per jax, nothin like le banquise. awesome service! belle gueule was as described by the staff."}
{"text":"Went looking for a good pub in Old Montreal, and decided to give this place a try. I would stay away and suggest a pub on Peel or Crescent. We arrived and asked for a table by the window, we were told our best option was the bar. why? Apparently the tables by the window were reserved but nobody was ever seated there, the entire time we were there. Food here is way over priced. We got a cheeseburger, tiny pepperoni pizza, nachos and 3 beers. ---$75! Not only was it expensive, it had no flavor at all."}
{"text":"Very cute place, but service sucked! Had to go to the bar twice to place my drink order because the only had two servers working the whole pub. Server did not know what a White Russian was and it was listed on the drink menu. When we went to cash out, they over charged us for our drinks!"}
{"text":"Standard fried, bar food. Needed to find somewhere kid friendly, in a hurry when visiting Old Montreal. The pub is very spacious with good views of the river and Rue St.Paul. It's a nice renovation of an old warehouse type building and has kept some of its old world charm. The place was lively and busy but not raucous. We didn't have high expectations of the food and as expected it was pretty average. The Nachos were good, as were the very small chicken wings. The Burger was OK, nothing special, but my wife hardly touched her pasta duo - a combo of their tomato and alfredo pastas. The tomato one tasted like it was straight out of a jar and the alfredo just lacked flavor. I wouldn't come back here, but for what we needed it suited just fine (don't get the pasta)."}
{"text":"Par un froid après-midi d'hiver alors que nous déambulions dans le Vieux-Montréal, nous avons décidé d'entrer au Pub St-Paul pour assouvir notre soif et notre petite faim.

Au 2e étage d'un vieil édifice, après un escalier pentu se trouve une salle en bois et en pierre décorée avec une guitare GÉANTE au plafond. Un bar se trouve au centre, les tables se trouvent des deux côtés de la pièce, près des fenêtres, une des vues donnant sur la rue St-Paul, l'autre donnant sur le port. Il y a aussi un 3e étage ou se trouve la cuisine et les salles de bains.

Le menu bar est tentant, la table d'hôte n'est pas chère. youppi !
Nous prenons les ailes de poulet (frites) la sauce est goûteuse et les ailes sont charnues.
Les nachos sont très copieux mais ils ont l'air préparés depuis longtemps ( le fromage a déja eu le temps de figer alors qu'on vient tout juste de nous apporter le plat.) 
Les boissons sont assez dispendieuses pour un simple bar (9$ un drink)

Le service est agréable. La musique est bonne. Nous reviendrons probablement !"}
{"text":"I went there as a part of the saute mouton package and I was pretty impress. Better food then most pub I went to, great history, the price are not bad for being in the heart of old Montreal. We sat right by the window and you have the best view ever. You ca. See the main street and people just walk by and waive. We were a VERY large group and it didn't affect the service at all. The wine selection was pretty good and same for the beers. The lasagna was one of the best I has and I was pretty surprise. A friend had the steak and it was pretty decent for a pub. A must go....fun and casual ambiance"}
{"text":"I can't believe I still hadn't reviewed Pub St-Paul.  As I recall, we were taking a leisurely stroll down the cobblestone streets in Old Montreal when we realized it was mid-afternoon and we had yet to eat lunch.  I suggested we walk up a flight of stairs to check out Pub St-Paul.  My boyfriend was craving poutine (we sampled lots of poutine on our MTL vacation!) and I was in the mood for a Mexi-salad or at least some kind of flavorful salad.  Pub St-Paul had not only a selection of various poutines but also a spicy chicken salad which thinking about now makes me hungry.  

The space itself was big and open with a couple of bars, pool and foosball, and space for a band to play on live music nights.  The waitress was very friendly and had stories about when Michael Phelps visited Pub St-Paul while in MTL.  

Other than the enormous \"Last Supper\" painting featuring John Lennon as Jesus, surrounded by other music legends, Pub St-Paul wasn't that remarkable but I wouldn't be opposed to returning next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fun place. Good food, nice staff. Located in the heart of Old Montreal. Very affordable lunch with good beer specials. Would recommend it to anyone visiting the area who is looking for good affordable food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"imagine a huge sports bar which focused its atmosphere more on music instead of sports. such is an apt description of Pub St. Paul. I mean, they have a giant painting of \"the Last Supper\" with John Lennon as Jesus, flanked by Alice Cooper, Bob Marley, Janis Joplin, David Bowie, and other legends. IT IS AWESOME.

we dropped in for a late lunch; I had a beer and poutine. not the best poutine I've had, but not bad. the option for a spicy pepper gravy with your poutine is clutch. Caroline had a grilled chicken salad - I sampled the chicken and it was nice and spicy!

service was good. considering we came in the afternoon, it wasn't very busy. it looked emptier than it really was because this place is HUGE - two floors! holy crap! the main floor has tables which overlook the port, or tables which overlook the streets of Old Montreal (we chose the former).

I liked this place, though I feel it would be much better at nighttime. pool and foosball tables in one corner. they have live bands play, open mics, jam sessions, and of course, drink specials (like 3 dollar shots of Jack...sign me up)!

definitely gonna check this place out again on future trips to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The all u can eat fish-chips was awesome. I upgraded my fries to poutine and it was worth it. Bartenders were very helpful. Good dive bar"}
{"text":"Very cool pub with history.  Food is way better than most pubs!  You should hit this spot in winter or summer.  In the winter time it's great for a place to warm up, while shopping and wandering around Old Montreal, sipping a special coffee.  Summer is great just because it's summer and we like to drink beer in Old Montreal..."}
{"text":"Went there this evening, bartender apologized for unprovoked attacks from racists who didn't like me speaking english in their bar.  Welcome to Quebec..."}
{"text":"\"All you can eat fish and chips\" is not what you are given when you order it. My husband likes to eat, and ordered the fish and chips. Was brought out three pieces of fish. After it was eaten and my husband was ready for more fish , the waitress asked him ( rudely) \" how many times are you going to get more fish?\" When he told her he wasn't sure, she proceeded to bring out one small peice of fish, and informed us that anymore tartar sauce would be a dollar. Frustrated , we decided that we were done eating. After we paid, the waitress told my husband that the tip was not sufficient. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Paid $6 a person to get in so we could hear some live music.  Well, the band came on an hour late, would play fr one song, LITERALLY ONE SONG, and then take a break.  And they sucked.  There are so many better places to go in the area.  Skip this bar."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place for a low-key dive-bar night out! The food is AMAZING!!! (Endless Fish & Chips) The prices are very reasonable, too. It's an upstairs bar in Old Montreal, kind of hidden from the bustle. The staff are so friendly and the service is perfect."}
{"text":"Always start with something nice...the staff were pleasant, and there were loads of them.  Lots of promise with river and street views, three floors...but failed miserably to deliver on food and drink...basics for a \"pub\".  I was one of 5 clientele.  Half the beers were off, and the steak and frites were less than pub standard, and certainly less than old Montreal expectations.  Never again."}
{"text":"Only got drinks, which were fine. Great location and has a dive bar type feel but holy crap was the service bad. Not friendly, clumsy, and not attentive. Plus, when I got the cheque, my total was $13. I gave him a $20 bill and he goes \"so this is good then?\". WHAT?? The audacity was shocking. Only reason I'd ever go back is to escape the cold, which was why I even went in to begin with."}
{"text":"Local low key spot. More like a dive bar. If you're into that kind of scene, it would be good for you. Definitely super casual and a place to get a beer"}
{"text":"I went in on a quiet Monday evening with my wife. The bar was absolutely deserted, which is not surprising for anyone who knows Montreal. We ordered drinks and poutine; we were not at all disappointed. The poutine was classic and exceptionally good, and the service could not have been friendlier or more attentive. Worth a regular visit. Can't wait to return on a night when there is live music playing."}
{"text":"We wandered by looking for a quick bite and the kids were interested in their menu so up we went. By up, I mean there is a big flight of stairs that you must climb to get to the dining room. It is a big place with a huge bar, good menu with pretty standard pub fare. The staff was pleasant and they have the feel of a neighborhood dive. It wasn't busy while we were there but the tables around us had dirty plates on them for a long time. Maybe they were understaffed or were going through a shift change, but it kind of impacted our experience. The food was good. There was a fun music vibe and the decor was rock and roll to the max. There are a ton of other options in the area yo explore so it may be a while before we would consider going back."}
{"text":"Top 5 worst dining experiences I have ever had. I get it. You were getting ready for a private party. If you can't handle having a party of two for dinner than just tell them. Don't seat them and then act like their presence is the biggest inconvenience that has ever been bestowed upon you. Shameful. Especially in an area with so much competition. Spend your dining dollar elsewhere."}
{"text":"Where to start. I was in town for the weekend and decided to go to the Bagel Burlesque Expo brunch here. Doors were at noon, show at 1:00. I've been to burlesque brunches in other cities before and generally like them a lot; I know that I'll probably be sitting at a table with people I don't know and might have to turn my seat to see the show, but it's a full brunch with burlesque, and you can roll out at 10 AM or later and be home with time for a nap and catch a show. What's not to love? And this show included a buffet brunch in the ticket price, so it was a great deal.

So first I want to say the organizers of the burlesque expo were great through all this, definitely cared about the experience and doing a good job (full disclosure, I knew some of the out of town performers and a volunteer at the expo, but I don't know the organizers). The problem was definitely with the venue. Doors opened at 12:00, and I got there at 12:30. I saw a performer I knew who told me there'd been a change. Instead of being on the main floor, we were in the much tinier upstairs. The lower floor was dead empty when I got there. I had bought my ticket in advance, but since the space was so much smaller than what the organizers booked, there were no seats left. The organizers conjured up a seat at the back, and I went to get food. There were no forks or knives, only small plates, and the hot food was gone. Surely with half an hour to show time they'd bring more! They did not. I grabbed half a bagel, but I'm allergic to wheat, and my mouth started to react (I'll spare you the details of what that was like, but believe me you don't want to experience this happening to your mouth), and in pain I was left with no food options. Thankfully I knew a volunteer who came over because I am not exactly the person going to complain and demand my money back because a buffet has food I'm allergic to. The volunteer asked the kitchen to bring me a plate of eggs and bacon since I couldn't eat the stuff left and apparently the kitchen was not providing more buffet food. Again, before the show had even started. So thirty minutes later, after the show started, someone brings me my food.

Now I have eaten a lot of diner food. Nothing like a week of driving through the American Southwest teaches you to be less finicky about diner food. So when I read reviews saying \"the food was swimming in oil,\" I usually do not refrain from eating there and assume it's the exact right amount of grease. Oh honey. These eggs were swimming in oil. At first I thought the tomatoes on the side must have leaked juice or something because there was a distinct puddle of wet. It was oil. The bacon was super crispy, which thankfully I like, but the eggs sat in my stomach like a brick, and I haven't been able to eat much all day since those eggs at a little past 1:00. It's 8:30 now.

Literally every good thing about my experience was because of the organizers busting their backsides for the audience and counteracting the venue:
-switching the show to a too-small space
-not providing sufficient food, cutlery, and plates, even when there were clearly people getting a \"brunch\" of untoasted bagels and croissants 
-having remarkably slow service AND I AM  EUROPEAN. I know from slow service.

And then finally the food wasn't even good! Bleh. Thank goodness the show was fun (best stage hand \"ladies\" ever, made between acts a hilarious part of the show). But next time I'm in town I will steer clear of this place. If it takes half an hour to get eggs in oil on a dead Sunday afternoon when there were supposed to be eggs ready to go, I cannot imagine what it is like on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to reward \"M\" with a beer after touring the View Montreal area.  $8 beers in a upstairs bar overlooking the waterfront.  Yes it feels slightly touristy but this is a touristy spot.  Service was good but we didn't eat, so no food comments."}
