{"text":"Food was essentially McDonalds quality. Advertised as fresh, it was mostly prebaked and prepackaged. Terribly disappointing."}
{"text":"Bad breakfast. Lukewarm.  Wife's bacon was rubbery and cold. They replaced and were willing to replace again, but \"it will be the same. The bacon is pre-cooked.\"  Sorry, David Burke. This is unacceptable. They did take $1.84 off the bill to their credit.  Appeared to be some argument with manager/staff. Server tried hard but could not overcome kitchen shortcomings."}
{"text":"Absolutely dreadful service, we never got our food at the grab and go section after 35 mins and no one barely in the kitchen, they hadn't even started our order so we demanded our money back.... If I could put a massive zero on this I would!"}
{"text":"Below average. Had s wrap that was too dry and no flavor. If I was a chef I wouldn't attach my name and reputation to this place! Way overpriced!! The bartenders try and shove shots down your face to upsell. Disappointing"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here over CPK or one of thr fast food places because they had seating and it has a chef owner but the food is Nothing special. All the food seems to be frozen items that they reheat and just whip together. Would have been better off at Wendy's.The waitress was nice."}
{"text":"If your goal is speed, then this place does alright. We were in and out in about half an hour. Service from Charles was great.  Unfortunately, the food was lackluster, ESPECIALLY for the price. I got the Caesar salad and the lettuce was not super fresh - wilting with a few pieces moving into their slime stage. It also comes with prepackaged Hellmann's dressing which you have to put on yourself."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in after looking at the menu & spotting White Chicken and Mushroom chili, which sounded perfect for the cold I'm trying to fight... only to find out after I ordered my $17 mimosa that they don't serve soups until lunch. Would of been nice to know before I sat down, maybe consider putting that on your menu. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Shame I have to give it a star. Sat for 10 minutes without being acknowledged by a server, walked by the bar as I left to make sure the manager knew he was losing business. He didn't seem to care much. Given that lack of care for customer service and basic understanding of restaurant budgetary functions, I think I dodged a bullet. (I know the things that go on in kitchens staffed by people with attitudes I saw on display.)  My husband and I are gay. Had a rainbow hat on. Not sure if that's a part of it, but I'll be avoiding this place. I recommend you do the same.   P.S. There are buttons on the table for requesting service/bills/etc. They CLEARLY do not function."}
{"text":"Make sure if you want a salad u buy it out of the case.  I asked for a chicken Cesar because there was none left and got charged an extra 4 bucks.  Was it any different - hell no!   Took him 30 seconds to make it and didn't even toss it- got my bag of dressing and off i  went. Oh and when I asked why it was more $ they told me it came with fries-!  A salad with fries- not a chance. So I tried to reason with the manager after he realized that it was a salad (w no fries) as to me having to pay a penalty because they were out- and he just didn't get it.  I am sorry I asked for them to make me one- would've preferred they told me they were out.   At least they couldve warned me it was more $   The salad was fine-but its the principle of it.  Next time I will skip that food option"}
{"text":"OMG...an airport \"dining' or TAKEOUT 'restaurant'.  HORRIBLE!  You MAY MISS your flight.  And to top it off, the food is HORRIBLE...and of course BAD SERVICE to go along with it!  If I could give them ZERO stars, I would.  The poor man before me, requested a refund because he'd been waiting a LONG time, and about to miss his flight.  The cashier basically dissed him, and said his order would be ready shortly.  Well, now I knew my 15 minutes were going to take 20-30 minutes too!!!  I also asked for a refund and was told the same thing.  TEN MINUTES later, I got my order.  To TOP THIS ALL OFF!  It wasn't the correct item ordered.  Surely others know/have ideas on what a panini sandwich is, and should look like.  Well attached are pictures of my $13 airport sandwich looks like...NOT very appealing or appetizing.  Airport monopoly or not, this place needs to close (like his \"showcase\" restaurant did @ the Venetian...likely same reason: bad service, mediocre food, high prices...not a formula for success!)  Respectfully, the traveling NJ Foodie"}
{"text":"I get that people working in these establishments are not overly satisfied with their career choices but that leaves no excuse for rudeness. I witnessed a customer sit down and ask for a coffee. The server, William, told him that they stopped serving coffee at 10am. The gentleman asked for a water. After 5 minutes William asked if he wanted something to eat and he declined. William asked him to vacate his seat for a paying customer in a rather stern tone. The gentleman got up saying that he was about to order a drink but decided against it to which William responded by shouting an insult as he left. The customer returned, I assume to get his name, and the insulting tone continued as he left again. I also left the establishment at that point, favouring anther place in the airport. A rather interesting attitude to display in a place that looked like it needed customers."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever posted a review. Food is good, service horrible. I witnessed your server Joe display blatant racism. He was rude to a table multiple times and actually shook his head at me and said \"asians, asians\" wow. I almost got up and walked out. They were not busy but I had to ask someone to take my order. My credit card also sat on the table for 10 minutes at the end. They have buttons on the tables to push for service  that may as well be removed because they ignore them."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich is pretty good and friendly service but not very efficient. And what's with the styrofoam containers? Very environmentally irresponsible. No one else uses those anymore. Get with it!"}
{"text":"If you consider this as a cheap diner it is only bad.  But since your meal will be, \"gourmazing and made with revolutionary products and cooking techniques\", it is absolutely terrible.   My ultimate cheeseburger was a suboptimal patty with a slice of cheddar on a dry bun with mushy pickle slices from jar.  I went with salad rather than fries--large mound of unevenly chopped lettuce, a few shreds of mild cheddar, a nice quarter dill, two huge pieces of soft cuke, and a cherry tomato.  The jumbo jack and side salad from jack in the box is better food and would run me about 3 bucks.  Plastic cutlery really accentuates your experience.  On the plus side, most people avoid this place like the plague, so i have an entire booth during a busy travel day and am enjoying a game on TV.  My cell phone is plugged in.  I am having a michelob ultra which is what an american light lager should be."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Bar tender refused to put the World Cup and NBA Finals on one of multiple televisions. So much for hoping to watch sports in a sports bar before my flight."}
{"text":"The breakfast food was ok...it didn't make me sick which is always a plus. But it was a let down when it arrived because it is not inline with the hype. They have a TV at the register with videos playing showing all the gourmet food Burke whips up. So you think this will be airport food with flair. Then the sandwich arrives on a dry pretzel role, with frozen hash browns. But the worst part was waiting 15 minutes for it. That is a long time to wait when you are trying to catch a plane and esp for what struck me as subpar food. Personally I think the breakfast sandwiches at Starbucks taste better and I know they arrive faster. I would do the Starbucks next door next time instead."}
{"text":"Long wait, pretzel bun hot but chicken was cold. They took off the bill and brought another on but, chicken was cold on that as well. Floors are dirty. Think I'm being nice with 2 stars.  Sont go if youre strapped for time."}
{"text":"Fast, I can say that.   Food is lack luster at best.   Seems they just skip things that are listed on the menu.   I ordered a California club wrap that came with Chester fries.  Asiago cheese with truffle oil.   Well, regular fries and a wrap that was missing three ingredients.   When I ask, oh sorry we re out of those right now so we just served what we have."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, the beer was cold, and the food did not make me sick.   5 stars to upset the self-appointed gourmands who feel compelled to write negative reviews for airport food."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have had in my life! Low end of frozen stuff you'd buy at the supermarket."}
{"text":"Despite the relatively bad reviews, I hesitantly decided to grab a bite to eat here after my United flight was delayed as usual.  After perusing the decently varied menu, I ordered the Prosciutto and Arugula pizza along with a 9 oz. merlot.  Honestly, I've had much better, but the pizza wasn't bad as far as airport food is concerned.  The waitress from NY was very pleasant and timely.  Yes, it was pricey but hey, it's Vegas and it's at the airport for crissakes...  Would definitely be a repeat customer if I had to wait around again."}
{"text":"As a frequent business traveler to Vegas,I usually take the 6am or 7am flight out when returning home.  With limited early morning  breakfast options at the airport,  I was happy to have stumbled upon the burke in the box \"on the fly\" carry out option a few years ago. Now it is a ritual for me.   Julia, at the counter is always friendly ( even at 4:15 am), and the egg white pretzel breakfast sandwich always hits the spot.  A little pricey, yes, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever seen! Quite frankly this is a disgrace to David Burke's name- there was no sense of urgency which is a bit odd/annoying because you're in the airport and even the \"on the fly\" section was the same slow and terrible service.  We walked into the dining area and neither waitress tried to make eye contact with us to tell us if we need to seat ourselves or wait so we caught another guests eye and asked them what they did and we sat ourselves. The waitresses looked absolutely miserable-as if they didn't want to be there or were so tired that even smiling was an issue. We sat at a table for 11 mins and finally there was one waitress that was walking by us and i flagged her down for her to tell me she just had to drop off a check and she will be back-she handed them the check and went to clean up another table and it seemed like she was there for at least 5 mins-at this point we got up and left and walked right past her but she didn't bother to apologize or ask us what's wrong.  We then go over to the on the fly and after we have our order i expresses my concerns about how miserable the waitresses look to Diana, the manager (who looks no happier to be there) and she proceeds to tell me they are having a bad day but she will talk to them- umm ok..fix the problem now!? Everyone was looking at each other side eyes because the service was horrible in the dining area.  The only competent person was the guy checking us out ahmedin, who looked happy to be there but also understood why we were so annoyed.   Our food took forever! No one had a sense or urgency at all and my panini was cold but good Lord i wasn't about to say anything because i had a flight to catch- but i did ask for chipotle mayo which took 3 mins to come to me and i was standing at the register the whole time! I asked him how can he stand this!? Why is everything so slow here and he chose not to comment but just smile. The woman he asked for the sauce told him to wait and then slowly walked to the back took 2 mins back there and slowly walked back and slowly put the sauce in the container and handed it to him-again, i wouldn't expect this from a David Burke restaurant-did he just get lazy and doesn't care about what they are doing to his reputation? I also own a business and if i were him, i would fire everyone (except ahmedin) and start over with people who care and want jobs! It all starts and ends with management"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Seated myself a a table that had not be cleaned. It took 20 minutes to get a waitress. I'm a fan of David Burke's but he must have simply licensed his name out. He would be embarrassed by this place. Why Distress your name and reputation David Burke? Do you need the money that badly?"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service is horrible. First time I went I sat for 15 minutes and nobody ever came by to take my order so I went to their take out counter,  ordered my food then brought it back into the restaurant. The second time I went they said it would take 60 minutes to make a tuna melt. The airport wasn't even that busy. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"I had to grab a quick lunch before boarding my flight but should have gone hungry instead. The employees are grumpy and unfriendly. I waited for almost 40 minutes for my meal (hamburger, $17!!!) which was below average, overcooked and dipping grease.  I will not even start describing the fries as they found their right ending in the garbage bin. Save yourself 15 bucks and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Wow.....this place is terrible!  I wish I had checked the reviews before sitting here.   I sat at the bar since it seemed to be quicker than looking for a table. The bar tender was quick to take a drink order from me, and I looked at the menu.    The menu wasn't too spectacular, but hey, it's an airport. I ordered the Ruben panini---pretty hard to screw that up....they did.  The bread was a multi grain roll that was nasty. The corned beef had been cooked too long and was horribly chewy.  There was barely any Russian dressing on the bread (a key component to this sandwich).  It was probably one of the nastiest sandwiches I've ever had.   The fries---nothing special here folks.    While writing this review, a customer asked for a Chicken Cesar with Balsamic dressing....which was met with \"we don't have any balsamic right now.  Just oil and vinegar\"---how he heck do you run out of a dressing like that?  That's a staple!  Luckily, this customer went elsewhere which is what I should have done.   This restaurant is an insult to David Burke and is not worth anyone wasting their time or money."}
{"text":"Just ordered a beer from here. The bartender offered me a 5$ shot along with it. For 13$ I got an angry orchard and a fireball shot (not bad for an airport, I paid 11 at ohare for a vodka tonic). My flight got cancelled so I was talking to the bartender and she seemed genuine and super friendly. Had a totally crappy day she made it a little better so thank you!"}
{"text":"I was hopeful this place would be better than typical airport fare, as it advertises as gourmet and is connected to someone calling himself a chef. Unfortunately, the food is typical, boring and bland, showing no signs of a chef ever having much to do with the place besides plastering his picture on the wall. Besides that the \"service\" stinks, if you can even call it that."}
{"text":"The burger was just plain bad. It was in the bottom quarter of worst burgers I've paid for. No onion or pickle to give it flavor. The hamburger patty itself was nearly tasteless. The only flavor i could detect might be what you taste when you thaw hamburger in the microwave. The fries were even a bit tasteless for restaurant fries. Adding salt to them barely made an improvement. I'm thinking their food is sourced by a cheap low quality competitor of Sysco. I found it ironic that there was wall art in our booth that pictured a delicious looking hamburger yet mine looked and tasted so pathetic. Wife surprisingly said the chili was good. Wish i would have ordered something harder to screw up, like a cold sandwich."}
{"text":"Rude slow service. Bar was full so sat in dinning area. Could not get waited on so I tried to order at bar. Bartender refused to take drink order. Can't get waited on in dinning area and bartender refused service. Nice system. Should have checked rating first. Once we got waited on waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"A little desperate for food, this was near my gate. The Kobe hot dog sounded interesting ($13) so I ordered it and the Chefster fries ($3.60). But it seemed like no one worked there. A man walked past me behind the counter to harass an airport employee, there were people in the kitchen gossiping but no one noticed me. Three minutes past and I was thinking, maybe I'll have Starbucks when a cook walked behind the counter, gave me a look then said,\"Someone will help you in a moment.\" A minute later, a woman came from the kitchen and took my order. She let me know it would take 7 to 9 minutes. I waited probably 5 minutes. It was about 115pm, most of the end of the airport I was at was empty. The dog is ginormous. The grilled onions were really good but the dog was .. okay. Not great. The Chefster fries were meh. I wouldn't suggest this place if you have the time to stop elsewhere."}
{"text":"Keep your expectations low to avoid disappointment.  Food is marginally better than standard airline food, and service is depends on the patron/server ratio. If it's full of people, expect a long wait and salty, uneven service.   But, the food is warm and the beer is cold. Staff seems nice, if a little worn by the flow of travelers."}
{"text":"When the waiter looks at you and tells you on the down low not to eat here, and wait to get home, that's when you know you should definitely not eat here. Run to Baja Fresh instead!"}
{"text":"$24 for a burger and beer.    An airport is not the sort of place where one searches out fine dining.  In fact, it the sort of place where hungry travelers seek out average dining at stratospheric prices.  Such is the case at Burke in the Box at McCarran Int'l Airport in Las Vegas.  The good:  1)  The only place I could find on concourse D near my gate (53) which accommodated sit-down dining. 2)  Wide selection of hot dogs, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered a cheese burger with blue cheese, raw onions, lettuce and tomato.   The burger came with a generous helping of (what appeared to be) re-heated French fries with truffle oil.  I also had a 20oz Stella. 3)  Good selection of adult beverages 4)  Modest selection of dessert  The bad. 1)  OH MY GAWD: The bill.  $24 for a burger and a beer!! 2)  Understaffed.  The gentleman in the table next to me got up leaving his sandwich on the table to go the bar and order another drink.  While he was away the waitress cleared away his half-eaten sandwich. 3)  Pretense at fine dining.  The place is self serving trying to portray itself as haute burger-land: something which it is not. 4)  Televisions hanging on the wall with the volume up very high.  5)  The waitress added bacon to my burger - which I didn't ask for and charged me $1.99 extra.  Overall:  I wish more airports were like Dulles Airport in Washington where the prices in there are pretty close to those you'd pay outside of the airport.  The food was decent but it was not fine dining: no way.  Were the burger, fries and beer had come in at $15 I'd be singing the praises of this high-rent burger joint.  At $24 - not so much.  In Vegas one has the opportunity to gamble at almost every turn.  Rest assured that if you venture into this establishment that you'll come up with snake eyes."}
{"text":"hate this place but -at the airport- you're just stuck.  nothing special about anything.  Frantic staff, mediocre food, high prices, airport environment.  Here is a novel idea, why not put a clock in plane (ha!) view so you can track your flight times?"}
{"text":"One of those places that makes me wish we could give 0 stars. Food is rather expensive but being in an airport I expected that. What I didn't expect was when I ordered a $14 \"koba beef\" hot dog it would served on stale bread. Also the hot dog looked and tasted like a Hebrew national dog. My wife got the chicken panini that were to come with \"chefster\", these were nothing more than typical frozen fries that you can buy at Sam's club. Rounding out the lousy food was the lack of direction to sit yourself when you walk in. We had to be told by some people already in the restaurant that we had to seat ourselves. Stay away."}
{"text":"Lots to like about this little airport eatery. 1. Was open at 4:30am when I was there for a 6am flight. One of the few in the D gate area. 2. Rather reasonable prices on the food, though the drinks were expensive. 3. The pretzel buns were soft and delicious! As was the breakfast sandwich as a whole, which was huge! Hashbrowns were typical fast-food style, but tasty.  Will definitely stop by again if I'm ever flying out of Vegas this early again (really hope not) and am over in the area. Probably 3-stars in reality, but the fact it was open so early while other establishments were dark earns another star."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, 5:30 am and the hash browns were fried in very old oil, the breakfast sandwich was greasy, bacon tasted like gasoline, and it was a real waste of $10!  FORGET THIS PLACE.  Grab a granola bar somewhere else. You will be thankful."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Breakfast platter overpriced and substandard.  Cold limp brioche toast.  Fried eggs watery and cold.  Bacon is greasy with an off flavor,  the two greasy hash brown cakes were inedible,  Bloody Mary lacked any visual appeal,  blah atmosphere. Should have read yelp reviews."}
{"text":"This food is very underwhelming. You get no truffle flavor in their truffle oil fries. Their sandwich used low quality turkey cold cuts and soggy bacon. A glass of shock top, (a normally cheap beer, was $9. Sandwiches are all in the $15 range, so I'd say the menu is very pricy for such poor quality food. I'd give it one star if it weren't located in an airport."}
{"text":"For airport breakfast when sleep was quite minimal, this wasn't too bad. Greasy food was available!  They actually make real eggs to order rather than some artificial scrambled eggs from a box. The bacon was almost crispy and the hashbrown was straight from the freezer to the fryer.   Still, needing some brekkie before a long day of foodless flying, it filled me up without negative consequences.  Who is this Burke guy anyway and why won't they let him out of the box already?"}
{"text":"I had a Stella and a Reuben panini with fries.  Stella was $12.  I kind of agree with everyone else that this seems pricey, even for an airport.  At least it tasted like a Stella should.  The Reuben was ok but wasn't a panini like I am used to.  I'm thinking pressed bread sandwich.  It just seemed to be a Reuben on a seeded roll.  The corned beef was a bit gristly and burned my mouth when I couldn't get through the thing with a bite.  It was also greasy and the fries were just ok.  Bartender seemed to have an attitude with everyone except me, but she didn't really pay much attention to me.  I guess that's good.  I will look elsewhere on my next trip."}
{"text":"Joe, my waiter was super nice and attentive to everyone!  Realize that this is airport food, but I, like many others, expect more from David Burke. Had the Kobe Beef \"Bad as Dog\" and it had no flavor whatsoever and the relish was the strangest thing I've tasted. Won't be going back here again!"}
{"text":"Hyper expensive beer, $10 for a Stella. Dirty booths.  One waitress for the entire \"box\" wasn't enough to give customers the attention they deserve when you are raping them with high prices.  The wrap was ok, but barely."}
{"text":"Not even sure who Burke is but to lend his apparent name to this food is to bad. To be fair we kept it simple and just ordered the fresh fruit bowls. How do you go wrong with that. Well by adding the core of the pineapple is one way. As well as unripened cantaloupe. Maybe the rest of the menu is prepared with more oversight and care, but whoever was cutting fruit was definelty not having a great day...maybe next time."}
{"text":"As did a lot of my fellow Yelpers, I checked out the reviews of this place - but we were already seated when I did because it was the nearest restaurant to our gate.  To be honest, the reviews I read had me a bit worried but I know that each patron has their own experience and every business can have its \"off\" days.  Today was not one of those, really.  We were flying through on New Year's Day and I actually felt bad for our server...because she was the only server.  But I tell you what, she did a great job considering how full the restaurant was!  Her name was, I think, Kanesha.    It's a seat-yourself establishment and they have these neat little transponders on the tables with 3 buttons:  request service, request check, or cancel request.  We pushed the request service button quite a few times, not actually sure if was working or not because no one was coming to our table.  But after we observed this nice lady run all over the place, we realized she was the only server working.  She came to our table and took our orders right away.  Given the stress she  had to be under, she was extremely pleasant and very efficient!  Our drinks came out very fast as did our food!  Which was a real surprise.  We probably sat down, ordered, and received our food in 30 minutes or less.  If I could give this restaurant a rating based on the service we received by Kanesha, it would have 5 stars!  Unfortunately, the food was mediocre.  I ordered the smoked turkey panini sans bacon, my mom and her husband ordered the margherita pizza and Caesar salad to split.  To be honest, I liked their pizza better than my sandwich.  I did not try their salad, however.  The best part of my sandwich was the panini - it was actually pretty delicious.    I've been a traveler all my life (since I was in diapers) so I've grown to learn that airport food is not always the best...especially considering they charge you an arm and a leg for the food.  Overall, the experience here wasn't bad.  The service was great, the food not so much."}
{"text":"Pretty rough. This airport needs to step up with food options. I had a breakfast sandwich w/egg, cheese, bacon on a pretzel bun. The sandwich was ok at best. The bun was stale. The eggs, cheese and bacon where just that. The potatoes on the side were undercooked and not very good at all. The server was good but a real loony bird. She seemed to have the same canned speech she delivered to every table. She called me miss twice, I think because the table beside me had a lady and she stopped there first then to my table. Guess I just wait till I get to another airport to get food next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was one of the rare times that I haven't looked at reviews before I went to a place. Nevertheless the service was excellent to me. The place got pretty crowded up to about 25 people that were watching the baseball championship. Servers were friendly and I got drinks very fast. I sat there for about two hours waiting for a flight without any interruption at all. The menu looked so so but I doubt if I will order anything as I only had drinks. I like the fact that they didn't force me to continue ordering and I was able to sit as long as I wanted to. Because I did not eat or try the food I'm only going to leave three stars. Out here"}
{"text":"Worst pizza in my life. Cheap frozen cheese pizza base with uncooked ingredients dumped on top. The manager argued 'that's how we make them all'. I demanded my money back and he angrily threw the pizza in the trash in front of a line if customers before refunding me."}
{"text":"As terrible as a meal could get. Pizza with prosciutto and arugula resembled cracker bread with a meat volcano on top. Waitress seemed to think the pizza was the best thing ever but she also looked like she didn't discriminate against too many meals. Great ice water though! High quality stuff on the rocks."}
{"text":"Horrible on the go service. Took 25 min for a sandwich that was supposed to take 10. Was in a rush and definitely was not happy considering it was supposed to be quick."}
{"text":"I mean, really what can you expect from an airport except when in Denver. Great restaurants there, but definitely not in Vegas airport. Burke Box offers a good place for a quick beer, but abrupt and borderline rude service. Food is so so. Might be very good if you don't eat out much and live in a hoarder house."}
{"text":"What low standards from a so called celebrity chef. I walked in around 9:00am for breakfast. The place was mostly empty and not a clean table to sit at. Waitress told me to sit anywhere I like and watched me bus my own table. Menu options for breakfast was poor. But the worst experience was the presentation of the plate. Over cooked shrunken bacon. Plate was too small and items just fell off the plate on to a dirty table. I can get a better meal at any local diner. They try harder. I witnessed a table of 6 just get up and leave to find another place. David Burke should stop in and have breakfast/lunch and see if this meets his standards. They didn't meet mine."}
{"text":"I've eaten at David Burkes restaurant in Chicago and it was hands down a meal to remember.  The concept at the airport locale is no doubt different and it shows.  Food is average, but tasty. If you're looking to stay away from chains for a snack to take on your flight, this is a good choice.   Maybe my expectations were a little to high with Burkes name attached."}
{"text":"It was not very crowded and I seated myself, which was preferred.  Service: attentive and accommodating.  Food: Cobb salad, surprising great! Used the fancy micro greens, not the crappy ice burg lettuce while in Vegas.  Not sure why the bad reviews.  Good experience!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke!! .... David Burke --- what are you thinking?!  The only thing nice was the service and cold beer.  The rest is Awful!!  .... terrible processed & bad tasting food--- UGH"}
{"text":"It should NOT take 20 minutes to make a turkey club:  *wasn't grilled, was labeled PANINI *turkey was deli meat  Fries were generous, thick cut, not crispy and pretty greasy.    Liked my vegan wrap, light and healthy, just chuck the fries into the garbage and you get a light meal.    $26 for two meals."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst place in the world!!!!!!  The service is absolutely crappy.  Wait- that is the understatement of the century!     Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"STOP!  Before heading down to the end of the D gates, grab food!  Do not pass these other chain restaurants because your only choice will be Burke in the Box!  Here you will be asked to move tables to accommodate the server who has problems walking far.    Then, if you are lucky, you might get a chance to order a sandwich because you are in a hurry. Drinks are a joke!  I tried to order a single vodka drink and was told it wasn't worth it unless I ordered a double! Yup$17 for a watered down drink!  The food was ok. I ordered a pastrami sandwich with a packet of dressing in one of those foil packets. The fries were cold and oh so soggy.    BUT, when you are at the end of the D gate section, it's this or nothing."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a bite and wait for flight, nice staff and the food was not bad at all. Its not coffee shop food but its good."}
{"text":"Burgers, Chester fries (asagio fries) and bloody marys for that LV hangover before you fly home. The waiter was fast and attentive to us. Small but near the D50 gate to SFO."}
{"text":"I tried the tuna melt sliders with fries and they were ok. I expected a lot more from a David Burke restaurant, but should've known since its an airport restaurant. The bread on the tuna melt was good, but the tuna was alright. The service was also kind of weird. There was only one waitress that had too many tables, and she forgot to put in our order while everyone else after us got their food first."}
{"text":"I had a flight going out of D terminal, and Burke in the Box \"on the fly\" looked to be the best option.  It might have been, but the spouse & I were put over a barrel to figure that out.  I had an Arizona Iced Tea - $4!  Spouse's 20 oz Diet Coke - $3The sandwich & pizza prices weren't much better, price to quantity wise.  The food was decent.  My tuna slider's were tasty, but were better once I took off the pickle (too much dill).  They also would have been better if they'd given me one larger sandwich, rather than 3 mini sandwiches.  I don't need that much bread!  The fries were fine - nothing special, other than the fact that they didn't screw them up.  But 1 pizza, 2 drinks, and the tuna sliders came out to $33.  That's *way* too much.  Next time I'm at this terminal, I'll just stick with Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"The worse sandwich  i ever had in my life. tasted like a Wendy's burger.  really price and low quality for the price. defenetly they reheat the meats on a microwave .  i know airpot food is not the best, but honestly i had better food on a plane  avoid an get your food elsewhere"}
{"text":"Went in search for some food during a 3 hour layover. I ordered the pretzel chicken sandwich. This was not my best decision. Chicken was cold and tough to eat. I ended up just picking off he bacon which was also just meh.   I do have to say our waitress was so sweet. Great service. I just wish the service was somewhe  Next time we are in the airport again...we will be skipping this place."}
{"text":"Just ok. Had a tuna sando while waiting for a plane. It was heavy on one side and not on the other. Just ok. Came with fries. The service was ok also. Nothing special here. But the full bar. They will try to up sell you on doubles which she tried but I thanked her and asked for a single only. When I got the drink I thought it was a little stronger but not by much. So no biggie. When the bill came she charged us for doubles which was like $16 for each drink.. Total rip off. Won't be hitting them up when in need at the airport again.."}
{"text":"So, I love all things Top Chef in any of its various forms, and I am trying to have a Top Chef food baby before I die.  I am slowly but surely working my way up to this goal with much planning.  So imagine my surprise -- nay, sheer delight -- when I espied in McCarran Airport Terminal D, David Burke's \"Burke in the Box.\"  Whaaa?  Since it was 10:20 in the morning, I was nursing a hang- and gambling-over, and we had almost two hours to kill before our flight, I thought breakfast here (at a Top Chef-touched eatery in the *airport*!!) would really scratch a lot of itches.  All it did was irritate.  After drooling over the breakfast menu (I couldn't *wait* to sink my teeth into a pretzel bread eggwhite sammie with tomato, 'shrooms, and feta), the server informed us breakfast was over at 10 and we were now on the lunch menu.  I'm sorry, breakfast ends at TEN did you say??  I get that this is Vegas and time doesn't really exist/count here, but on what planet -- besides high schools -- do people eat lunch at 10:05?  So I ended up ordering a *ten dollar* tuna sandwich and husband ended up ordering a Caesar salad.  Wow, David Burke.  Just...wow.  Salad was romaine, cuke, tomato, Asiago (completely unconventional ingredients in a Caesar) and KEN'S DRESSING IN A BAGGIE.  So boring husband kept dozing off in the *plastic bowl* it came in and nearly poking himself in the eye with the *plastic cutlery*.  My sandwich was fine -- the tuna salad itself was actually quite good, with all white meat albacore, capers, celery, onion, and a touch of mayo -- but the rye bread was really thick and really dry so I ended up just eating the salad off of it.  The fries it came with were crispy and golden but didn't have a ton of flavor, and the *tissue thin paper napkin* couldn't keep up with my greasy fingers.  I overheard another waitress telling a different table that for $1 extra they could add Asiago and truffle oil to their fries.  Gimme a break, Burke.  Truffle oil fries and Ken's baggie dressing on the same menu?  Make up your mind.  Service was actually pretty good, especially since it was our server's second day.  He was on top of the ball and we never had to wait long for anything.  He even swooped in with a drink refill before I had the chance to open my big mouth.  Best part about Burke in the Box?  Watching the Bears hand the Cowboys their butts on home turf.  [Top Chef: David Burke]"}
{"text":"This may be a great place to eat, however I will never know.  I have no tried to dine at Burke in the Box twice and apparently I never will.  Both times the restaurant was full of 4 tops (or rather pairs of 2 tops) being occupied by 1 or 2 diners.  When I asked if the tables could be split up I was told, \"NO, that is the way they are set up and we can not move them\"  Sorry Burke my bucks will go somewhere else.  d"}
{"text":"Stopped in before our flight as it was in the terminal and pretty much the only thing still opened before our 10pm flight out on United. The staff was wonderful and kind, but the service was slow. We wanted 20 minutes for the check. The margarita pizza didn't look like margarita pizza at all as the basil was dried and flaked on. The pizza was big enough for two of us to share, so a bill of less than $20 for two in the airport isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Barely a 2 star rating.  There was only one real waitress for the entire place, and I assume only one cook in the kitchen.  They were swamped.  Luckily, we arrived at the airport early or we'd have been in danger of missing our flight...because it took a very long time for things to come out of the kitchen.  It wasn't the waitress's fault, though, and we still tipped her over 20%.  I know what that's like, and it's not fun.  The notice on the menu said that all burgers came out well-done.  That's fine with me, as I prefer backyard burgers to gourmet ones.  However, what used to be 8oz was dry as a bone and super lightweight.  They must have pressed hard on the patty while it was on the grill repeatedly, and then took it way past well done.  The potato kaiser roll that it was on was partly dry as well.  The boy ordered the proscuitto and arugula pizza.  It was a thin crust pizza, so I thought at first that it was expensive for something that was going to be not very filling.  Well, it turned out to have half an inch of melted cheese on the thing that solidified into one huge block.  It was very heavy and filling, although if you took off half the cheese, the tomato sauce they used, combined with the proscuitto and peppery arugula was quite good.  No complaints about their slightly battered fries that accompanied the burger, though.  They retained their crispness throughout the meal."}
{"text":"One of the few places to sit down and eat in the United gates section. Selection of beer is quite limited. I think wine selection fares better - while also small, it offers decent variety. Had glass of Benzinger Merlot, and it was very good. White Chicken and Mushroom Chili soup had good flavor - could've use a bit more mushrooms. The soup was served with a big blob of sour cream in a middle, which was rather distracting from the overall dish. If you will have this soup, may be ask for the sour cream on the side. Also had Turkey Club Panini, served with French fries. The French fries were crispy and well executed. The choice of bread was strange for panini (focaccia? too thick). The dish advertises chipotle mayo as one of the ingredients - there was a little package of standard mayo on a side - and even if there was something inside the sandwich, it was impossible to taste. If you mention ingredient in the menu, it is better be present...   Overall, it is an okay place, and if you want table and the service, this might be your best choice in that section on the gates (D50)"}
{"text":"We have some time before we board the plane. What else is there to do besides start drinking?!! We seat ourselves and wait. And wait. And wait! I noticed one of the servers was with a manager so I was trying to cut the staff some slack. Another server came out though and didn't even glance at us. Then the server I saw who had been with the manager was done with whatever she was doing and still we were ignored. I was like Come on. We'll just go up to the bar. Romano was tending bar and said he would be right with us. We ordered our drinks promptly - he even asked if we wanted them to-go and damn right we did so we got our drinks and were on our merry little ways. He was the only positive thing at this place for us. Besides the fact that they had alcohol. And not planning on ever coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Early morning departure, but they were open.  Sat down at the bar which had 4 people already served.  Waited 5 minutes before leaving.  Wasn't greeted by anyone nor told, \"We'll be with ya in a min...\"...nothing!  I don't ask for much, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken caesar is obviously prepared elsewhere and shipped in.  The dressing comes in packets and it's pretty much the most low rent $14 salad I've ever had.  The server was decent though.   Don't eat here.  Maybe grab a beer though."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here before my flight. I really expected more.  The service was terrible.  The egg white sandwich on a pretzel roll sounded great, but it was very poor.   There was absolutely no care in the assembly of the sandwich and the \"hash browns\" were just a deep fried triangle potato patty.    Unfortunately it's the airport, and when you give a long term exclusive contract to one operator, there is no concern for quality."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn about this place.  It was right next to my terminal for my flight out of Vegas and I didn't have lunch so I figured I would grab a bite from here.  First things first, everything is pricey, but I guess that's expected in an airport in Vegas?  I paid 16 bucks for a preztel panini and an Arizona Arnold Palmer.  The pretzel panini was chicken breast, bacon, tomato, provolone and a dijon mustard sauce on a pretzel roll.  It was pretty underwhelming.  Upon first bite I noticed that it was lacking flavor.  None of the elements in the sandwich stood out.  Could have used more sauce or some sort of seasoning.  I was tempted on smearing on a packet of yellow mustard, but decided against it.  On the other hand I did like the pretzel roll that the sandwich was served on.  The only real saving grace of this meal was the french fries.  They were thick cut, skin on, nicely fried and pretty tasty.  I would be willing to try the burgers, but seeing that it's in an airport in Vegas and I'm in Chicago it might be a while before I'm presented with that opportunity."}
{"text":"2 stars for the grill being open til 11:45pm. 0 stars for the shitty food. Burger bun was stale and falling apart, cheese wasn't even melted, lettuce was transparent. Beer selection was weak as well, and their bottle menu was inaccurate. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger sliders were.. aight. Not worth it for the price.   Service was friendly."}
{"text":"The rudest staff I have ever met!!!!  Wouldn't have stayed but only tv around to watch football game. Skip this one if u can"}
{"text":"After seating myself at the bar and taking my first sip of Bud Light, I logged onto Yelp and was disappointed to see all of the unfavorable reviews of this place. But, since there are limited dining options in Terminal D, I decided to stay. And I'm glad I did.  Several of the prior reviewers were disappointed in the service. The bartender today was about as cheerful and attentive as one could ask for. He seemed to genuinely enjoy interacting with all the people passing through to their various destinations.  Given that this is a Burke establishment, I ordered a bit out of the box for me - the prosciutto and arugula pizza. In one word: outstanding. Paired with a 9-ounce pour of BV Cabernet, I was in gastric heaven.  While, as other reviewers noted, this is a bit pricey, it is an airport after all. My pizza was $13.99 but would easily feed two adults. Drink prices were a bit steep, but I've come to expect that in airports.  I would do it again. And I probably will."}
{"text":"I wasted over 20 minutes waiting for my single croissant sandwich, after walking up to check they could not find my order anywhere and needed to refund me. I was not the only person in this situation this morning as many people had to cancel because of flights boarding and not expecting such ridiculous wait times.   Terrible service Terrible efficiency Terrible experience"}
{"text":"Honestly, it's pretty average. While it's true that unless I'm in a major hub (SFO, NRT, JFK, etc.), I don't expect fine dining, I do expect a little better than this.  For ~$14, I received a box of greasy eggs, bacon, and toast. Normally I would run the other way, but after a long night in Vegas, that was the perfect food for my current state of mind.  Unless you're hungover, I wouldn't really recommend this place, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Service was fine; the waitress was prompt, kind, and attentive.  The rating is strictly for the food, which was disappointing, even for airport food.  The Ruben was exceptionally small considering the price, maybe the size of half a normal sandwich. It was extremely light on meat, the kraut was flavorless, and the whole thing was served on a multi grain mini roll as oppressed to toasted rye. I would strongly not recommend this particular dish. Fries also fell flat. Standard pre frozen steak cut fare but without the decency to serve them freshly fried.  Perhaps the other food is better. Come here for the beer and shot and keep walking for something better to eat"}
{"text":"Great Pretzel Breakfast Sandwich!  I would leave the hash Browns.   They are pre-made;  but, they are okay.  Very good service.  We enjoyed a breakfast before a flight and were able to get in and out fairly quickly for a sit down place."}
{"text":"At the airport  really hungry and decided to stop by for some breakfast. The breakfast was good and fast. I had a cheese omelette, bacon, has browns, and toast. It def hit the spot. The waitress was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"There are no drink prices on the menu though there are prices for all other items. I asked the price for a margarita and he told me $12. I had said margarita and had to chase them down for the bill. Bill comes and suddenly the margarita was $17 when the bill came. I questioned him. His response: \"I told you it was $5 extra for a margarita.\" I didn't add any extra shots or anything else, nothing should have changed the price from $12 to $17.   Of course the end result was it was my word against his. This is the first time I've not left a tip somewhere. Put the prices on the menu and this \"problem\" is solved. But of course that'd make the bait and switch impossible, too, so I won't hold my breath.  I was planning to eat as well. Until I saw the food come out. I'd rather be hungry.   Don't do it.   Save yourself."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had.  I don't expect gourmet in the airport but decent would have been nice.  We ordered pizza b/c it can't be that bad right.  How wrong we were.  Pepperoni pizza was tomato paste on cardboard with melted cheese and tasteless pepperoni.  It has no taste, worse that a frozen pizza!  Go anywhere else in the airport!!!"}
{"text":"Eggs and toast were actually pretty good for an airport but it comes with McDonald's style hash browns - fries squares.  Gave me bacon when I ordered sausage.  Also charged $4.49 for a small bottle if Perrier - really?  Unfortunately at 6am there aren't many choices here."}
{"text":"10 minute wait for two burgers and one soda at a $35.00 tab with unfriendly staff.  Food sat on counter as staff disappeared and was finally served by kitchen staff after I scowled at them in the back.  My med well burger was over cooked and BLAND.  Their menu describes their food as \"deluxious\" and \"gourmazing\".  I would rather the sign read \"blandspensive\".  Wish I waited for airline food...  Does that say enough?"}
{"text":"A fine place to sit and have an $11 beer before your flight.  Ask Frank the bartender about the shot special.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"To the server who served my fiance and me, this is not about you. It's about your employer.  The food is ridiculously over priced. PLEASE read the menu before sitting down. We did read the menu, but as the other restaurants in the airport were super-greasy, we opted for Burke in the Box. The salad and soup was mediocre in flavor. The portion on the salad was bigger than I expected. (If I order a soup and a salad, I think of it being a cup of soup with a small/side salad, not a full entree of a salad with a cup of soup.)  The server we had was so sweet and attentive. She was a delight to speak with and did her best to handle the grumpy comments of another customer seated behind us.  Summary: if the other restaurants in the airport aren't sounding good, come here BUT be prepared to fork over a wad of money as the prices are high."}
{"text":"I was happy when I came across this little spot not too far from my gate. I ordered a killer breakfast sandwich... when I say killer I mean it. This thing was HUGE. It was on a pretzel bun which was tasty but there was honestly about 8 eggs worth of egg... I mean I guess that is good value. Who complains about too much food right? Well I had to toss a bunch of egg in order to fit this bad boy in my mouth but it was delicious."}
{"text":"I only has 45 mins to grab a bite to eat between flights and this was the only choice available. Their prices are RIDICULOUS!!! I paid $18.46 for a small paninni turkey club sandwichwith fries  and a drink.  The food was good, but the price was painful. The service was a little slow, but the man running the register was very friendly and nice so I couldnt complain. They really need some other choices for food in this airport so your not forced to pay this amount for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I didn't end up eating since the reviews were so bad. My IPA was huge and just what I needed. It was $13 plus tip so a little over the top but I was in an airport, so not too surprised (The wine list had prices, the beers did not. That was kinda bad juju.)  My waitress was fantastic even with them being slammed."}
{"text":"Cardboard tasting pizza with watered down sauce and low grade cheese.  I am a bachelor and will eat most anything. Plus a pizza lover that has trouble finding anything wrong with most pizzas   This pizza was awful.  Poor ingredients, poor texture, and surprisingly expensive.  I know it's airport markup, but the pizza was a giant saltine cracker with walmart pizza sauce and cheese on it.  There is no reason it should be $12.  I should have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Gourmazing? Not quite. My wife got a Vegan wrap that was supposed to come with portobello mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, mixed greens & peppadews. She got a wrap with not a single mushroom and the same sliced tomatoes that came on my sandwich. After sending it back they said they ran out of mushrooms and if we wanted to put something else on it. So when they run out of things they still try to serve it to the customer instead of not serving it at all. I got the Big Pretzal Panini. It was not big nor was it pressed like a panini. It wasn't bad but it wasn't any better than I could have gotten from one of the fast food places in the terminal."}
{"text":"EWW!! Never will I EVER return to this pathetic attempt of a restaurant.  I got a chicken Caesar salad and a cup of tomato basil soup with cheese tortalini.  Pretty simple right? So so wrong.  First of all, the menu said the salad was \"romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and parmesan cheese\"  the salad I actually received was wilted romaine with parmesan...only...  Do not even get me started on the soup... there was not one tortalini in it and it was luke warm upon arrival.  Not to mention it was just completely disgusting.   The service was just as terrible as the food, our server said she didn't have change for a 20.  Which is pretty baffling considering I'm sure some people have paid cash or will pay cash, so as a business it seems somewhat imperative to have cash on hand.  Anyways, she basically demands a credit card.  I refuse.  She comes back what seems like 15 mins later (keep in mind I told her we were in a hurry at this point) with change down to the penny?! Seems like someone is just lazy and didn't want to ask the bar for change. I use to be a server so I know how that goes.   AVOID. AVOID. AVOID."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst place I have ever eaten. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich. The bread was wet on the bottom and something on the sandwich smelled odd - not sure if sandwich or bread. Chicken salad must have been canned and was rubbery. French fries also smelled and had weird taste like they haven't changed oil. The kicker was the $17 Bloody Mary - I took one sip, and couldn't drink anymore. As someone who loves these, either they don't know how to make them or they have a bad mix. By the way, my colleague ordered margarita pizza, which looked like it was frozen - hardly any cheese, and I guess the few sprinkles of basil made it margarita. Either way - everything tasted bad and was way below expectations. The waiter quickly cleared our half eaten plates without comment. Other tables appeared similar. The waiter did ask about the Bloody Mary, if I wanted to take it in a plastic cup. I said I did not like it, and the reply was that others do. There was no offer for reimbursement, and this $17 drink sit full as we left. Terrible all around. Go anywhere else or starve - you are better off."}
{"text":"So I'm passing through the airport,  I was really hungry, this was the only sit down type place by my gate.  I checked out the reviews online, and they were definitely not good. The reviews online were actually pretty bad. I thought to myself since there aren't that many options by my gate, to give this place a try.  Well I'm going to give this place a 3 star. That was also stretching it,  because of a friendly waiter. So the service was pretty good. Took little time to order and get my drink. The waiter was good at his job,  kept the refills coming on the drinks.  The food however,  was not very good. I ordered a berger, it was a tasteless ball of mush. No taste,  I had to spend a lot of time doctoring it up,  kind of like this review, to make it acceptable. So in short,  staff was nice,  service was good,  prices ok, food not very. But it's the airport, what can you expect!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the fresh, huge portions here. My mom and I both got salads before our flight and we were beyond pleased with them. The only thing rough around the edges is the service. Everyone is in a hurry, so the servers really try to move quickly which can mean they skimp on the pleasantries. The only thing I was disappointed by was the salad dressing. This is supposed to be a gourmet on the go type of spot, but we were served a basket of packaged dressings. If they upgrade that, it'd be better! Otherwise, from the looks of it, the sandwiches and meals looked great. There's also a quick To-Go window if you are in more of a hurry!"}
{"text":"While waiting for a delayed flight I ordered tomato soup with tortellini (ONE tortellini). It was pitiful. So I ordered the pastrami sandwich which was so rancid I managed to choke down less than half before my body rejected it and I threw it up. Oh, also, when I got my bill it was $20 over. The bar dude was totally unrepentant. He corrected it without apology. DO. NOT. EAT. HERE."}
{"text":"I ate at the sit down part of the restaurant, it was super busy so no trouble with seating. The wait for the food was slightly longer than I expected, but I also take that as a good sign that the food was at least somewhat fresh. The burger and fries were good, I really enjoyed the burger. The bun wasn't flat, it seemed like it was toasted. Good place to eat for airport food."}
{"text":"I travel a lot to Las Vegas for business and have eaten here a few times and wanted to yelp out my experience given the largely negative reviews of this place.  The biggest complaint seems to be the service level and the one time I have eaten at this restaurant, the service was kind of lousy (I was told by the bartender to wait to be seated by the host, but lots of people came in and sat down at a table and I subsequently followed).  However, the service level today was much better and my server was very friendly.  I was a few hours early for my flight back home so I just decided to hang out here and do some work while waiting.    I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which also has apples, raisins, and tarragon.  This is one of my favorite \"to go items\" of any airport eatery that I have been to and this establishment's offering was tasty today.  The sandwich is accompanied with French fries that is smothered with cheese, truffle oil, and chives.  They give a very generous portion of this side which was definitely a plus.    Compared to other non-airport restaurants, I would agree with the general consensus that the service is sub-par and it is kind of pricey.  However, the quality of the offerings are good and I do keep on coming back here when I am at Las Vegas airport."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, I thought this place was great.  We had the tuna sliders with french fries.  The fries were amazing, and the sliders were yummy and really cute looking.  Service was quick, food was kinda slow coming out for an airport eatery though since people generally have a flight to catch.  would eat here again."}
{"text":"At first glance, it looks like upscale, quality dining in the United terminal of McCarran.  Looks can be deceptive.  Really, Burke is greasy, overpriced, and one of the few food choices without having to endure a long haul down another terminal walkway.   The margherita pizza was tasty, but tasty didn't come without being mega greasy.  That pizza was the sole reason that I fell asleep on my noon flight after a night of 7 hours of slumber and an hourlong nap on my first connection.   Food coma much?"}
{"text":"The service is the worst I have every had to deal with.   The waitress belongs at a truck stop   I waited 25 minutes for nothing.  She walked by 3 times yelling at the bartender for a bud lite.   I moved to bar and got service.   The bartender was good.   David Burke needs to take his name off this place.   Ok. So I just ordered the chicken Chili.  I wouldn't serve this to my dog.   The fruit flys are all over the place.   The board of health needs to be called."}
{"text":"OK, so yeah, it's an eatery in an airport, which is on par with an actual in-flight meal (sometimes, even worse). In other words: don't expect perfection.  We were famished on our way home from Vegas and eenie-meenie-miney-moe'd for this place. I'd never heard of it and I had had my fill of Ruby's Diners and California Pizza Kitchens that littered our terminal.  We chose a booth, sat down, and waited for service. I opted for the cheeseburger sliders (with fries and a pickle spear: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burke-in-the-box-las-vegas?select=qvB9heM4UE5V8TnStYN7cg#Od9Ld-nN2tNOnOJjcH2iOg). It was pretty standard, nothing to write home about. Because, really, we all know that anything that happens in these here parts stays here, amirite?  Hm... probably explains why this place isn't so popular.  Swing by with low expectations and an empty belly, and you'll leave fairly satisfied."}
{"text":"It's the only thing open after 7pm in the D Gates, so what choice do you have? I could complain that it is overpriced, but it's in the airport, so what do you expect? The food was okay. I had a hot turkey sandwich with meat that kept slipping out of the bread. I hate that in a sandwich. The thin crust margherita pizza wasnt bad. When your plane is delayed and are desperate, I guess you're stuck."}
{"text":"Other Yelpers have already said everything that needs to be said.  And yet...  Oh yes, AND YET I tried this place anyway, against all reviews and that nagging \"better judgment\" voice in my head.  Stupid stupid me.  I wish I could UN-do that because it turned out to be UN-impressive, UN-remarkable, and just a wee bit UN-friendly.  I was there on a dead day... midweek, few flights, no rushes.  And yet service was almost nonexistent.  Everything seemed to be a pain for my server - taking my order, getting me silverware, bringing me my check. The fastest she moved was to pick up my check as I was leaving to see how much I tipped her.  Food was decent but UN-inspired.  I had a passable Reuben but certainly was not impressed for the price.  Don't waste money paying for the special fries - they're regular frozen fries with grated parmesan cheese and a drop of truffle oil in there (supposedly) on top.  Too bad the frozen potato and stale cooking oil taste on the fries masks any other flavors.  Next time I'll stop being lazy and walk elsewhere in the terminal to eat.  For the money I could surely find better food.  Or comparable food much cheaper elsewhere.  Pass."}
{"text":"This place is crap - breakfast about the same quality as the burger king next concourse over, at triple the cost. Doubt the chef even knows hot to cook bacon properly. Don't waste your $$ on this."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here before our flight before he ordered we checked the reviews which weren't great and now we know why.. just don't eat here the reviews don't lie the chicken was def heated in the microwave and the cheese was barely melted it was just gross we got a refund and came to CPK much better!"}
{"text":"Ordered from the to-go counter.  Sit-down restaurant was closed when I visited at prime dinner hour on a weekday. WTF? Food quality was okay (3 stars) but prices are too high, even by airport standards."}
{"text":"They get one star because they were opened and next to the gate I came out of. I ordered tuna sandwich on marble rye and cheese fries. Not normal cheese fries this was shredded stinky cheese (Asiago) that doesn't melt. My fries were ice cold. I ordered and no lie less then five minutes later the food was out. I touched one of the fries and it was cold I told the waitress and she with attitude took it back. My waitresses name was Cynthia and she was horrible. I ordered a coke it was 3.99 but you get refills that's nice of you have a waitress that checks on you. When my food came back out the fries were rock hard and got like they threw them back in the fryer. I know it's a airport but come on I'm paying a lot of money and I'm hungry and tired be nice and make decent food."}
{"text":"Worst place i have ever been to.They say they offer breakfast.When you want to order they told us its until 10am and its now lunch..Are serious?10 am???What is this??they say its lunch already.Also the waitresses looks like someone is just filling instead of waitresses."}
{"text":"Let me get this straight....The only recent ratings over three stars come from Theresa G, who is obviously not reeling of a hangover, but obviously still inebriated by giving this place five stars, and from Rol T who describes a Cobb Salad as \"Great\".... Who on this planet would ever describe a Cobb Salad as great...even if it's the best Cobb on the face of earth???? I declare both Theresa G and Rol T be banned from posting reviews on Yelp. It's embarrassing for all of us....  Speaking of which, David Burke, whoever he is, I'm sure would be mortified beyond embarrassment with the quality of food being served here. He wouldn't be caught dead eating it. In fact, he may possibly die after eating here....the food quality is THAT BAD. I'm surprised I'm able to even write this review. I should be dead after eating here.  As we all know , you cannot give a zero Yelp rating. But if you could, the average of this place would be even lower, as many of us would have given this poor representation of David Burke (whoever he is) a big 'ol zero. So, since I have to give at least a star, I only give it to my waitress, Joyce. She is awesome."}
{"text":"For being in Terminal D of the Las Vegas airport, your food options are quite limited.  And on this Tuesday when we were flying out on our way home, half of the restaurants were closed.  We then stumbled upon Burke in the Box.  We were greeted by bartender John.  This guy is a trip.  He will talk to you about anything.  Make sure to ask him about domesticating saber tooth tigers.  We start off with drinks and take a look at the menu.  They have a good selection of food items.  Yes it is expensive, but you are in an airport in Vegas.  In fact you will  pay Disneyland prices at any airport, so it's expected.  I went with the sliders that came with fries.  The portions are generous.  The slider were very good and the bun was lightly toasted and the meat medium rare.  The menu is a bit deceiving about the truffle fries.  You won't get them with your side order of fries unless you ask for it, then there is a surcharge.  So overall, not bad.  A much better choice than Chili's or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a bite before your flight."}
{"text":"A clear disappointment.  Caesar salad was not even a real Caesar and came with a dressing packet on the plate.  Bloody Mary was $10 and too spicy, and their cheese fries with truffle oil?  A farce.  Bummed I spent my money here and didn't look on Yelp first."}
{"text":"David Burke you should be ashamed to have you name on this hellhole! So we didn't eat here, we walked out after 15 minutes of waiting for the one and only waiter to even acknowledge us.  It was fairly packed with travelers, on a Saturday morning , serving breakfast only .  4 people seated next to us complaining loudly none of their food correct, and not good.  Head to California Pizza Oven, great happy wait staff!"}
{"text":"Do not come here.  Had the egg breakfast.  Cold bacon, stale bread that had been fried and was called toast, served on a dirty plate with one of the weakest coffees I've ever had.  Truly horrible.  How David Burke can proudly display his face on each table is beyond me."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're in a time crunch. And $25 for a mediocre-at-best sandwich and coke? I don't care if it is sit down. No thanks. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Open at 0400.  Cashier was really attentive and friendly. So attentive, in fact, that she figured out that I worked for an airline even before I pulled out my badge.  That meant 10% discount. $8.35 for my toasted everything bagel and cream cheese and a Naked.  Not too shabby.    My only gripe is that they use a lot of styrofoam.  An entire black styrofoam box for my toasted bagel...Really?!    -1 star for that."}
{"text":"Don't bother ---thumbs down! Doesn't even look appetizing! Fries taste frozen and chicken looks like it was warmed up in microwave. Should've been a sign when no one at the bar was eating ...    Why can't we get good food at the LAS airport???!!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. They tell me 15 minutes later that they don't have what I ordered!!! Could the front person not know that right away? What kind of establishment is this?  Then they charged me again with my other orders and did not credit me properly with the first order they did not give me in the first place! Unbelievable!!! Stay away and avoid this place like a plague!!!! Zero star, no negative stars!!! Awful food and expensive!!!"}
{"text":"Awful service. I sat there for thirty minutes without even being acknowledged or brought silverware. One waitress ran from POS to POS while the other followed completely flustered. People had to chase them down to pay the check. Can't review the food cause I barely even got a menu."}
{"text":"I am soooo disappointed at the service. Our waitress took over 15 minutes to get me a cup of tea. According to her she was on the search for \"tea\". And She was not friendly nor apologetic! I would think she would understand that her clientele are all waiting to board. Some people spend hours waiting to board. At first when I walked in it earlier we got an African American lady. She was great. She was really nice , spoke to us and even Crack a joke with us. This young lady was professional and polite. I work in retail and I managed people. I expect my team to deliver great customer service because I understand how the business works. Most of my team has great reviews on yelp. Now after dealing with Robin  i will never come back and will let others that travel in Las Vegas know to not come here. To the store manager in Burke in box I urge you to coach this woman. She doesn't represent the company the way it should. I think coaching works if the employee knows her employee expectations and is accountable for her actions. Also talking about customers to other employees is unprofessional and should be frown upon. I in no way attacking her but rather point out her lack of professionalism and conduct."}
{"text":"2 coffees, 1 power aide, 3 bacon and egg croissants $33.25. Way pricey and the food was not much to speak of, but we were concerned we would miss our flight, and this eatery is conveniently adjacent to d52-59 Gates.  Try to eat before getting to the airports or try another restaurant."}
{"text":"Yea I never write reviews but this place was gross. The coffee was the equivalent of gas station coffee and I don't think they know was salt looks like."}
{"text":"It's airport food so I didn't expect much.  But the hot food was hot and cold food was cold. Wife and I split the turkey bacon sandwich which can with fries.  It was good with thick soft tasty bread.  It was filling and hit the spot to a hungry traveler.  Two ladies at counter very nice and kitchen staff wore gloves.  If they cleaned off the tables a little more often would be great.  It's pricey as you would expect. All things considered they are were good"}
{"text":"I mean, for airport food, it's freshmade and has some good choices.  I had the tuna sliders and they were fine (pricey at $12) but good.  Very greasy bread so ask for the bread dry unless you like that grease.  Fries were not good (edible but totally bland even with two packets of salt and ketchup.  The area of this food stand is lame overall so this is a good choice in that small area."}
{"text":"Suppose you woke up before the sun. Suppose you caught a flight to before you'd normally be at work. Suppose you landed in Vegas around 10:30 am local and are craving lunch. Suppose you travel a decent amount and are sick of waiting around for your bag. Suppose you realize 32 oz beers are a great way to wait them out.  If you can imagine yourself in this position, Burke in the Box is for you.   Yeah, the kobe dog and truffle fries were more gimmicky than they were good.  Yeah, the service had a way of disappearing for significant periods of time.  Yeah, there were visible stains from an unknown liquid on the walls.   We had a buzz before we had our suitcases!  We didn't dare tangle with the $4 Jager shots.   We're not animals."}
{"text":"It'll do in a pinch.  I've only been in for breakfast.  I overheard a waitress telling another customer that they use pre-packaged food; egg beaters, etc.  It's not gourmet, but it's decent diner-esque food.    The staff is generally friendly, and quick to get you in and out.    It is a little pricey (it's airport food, what do you expect?)...."}
{"text":"We are having a cheeseburger and Reuben sandwich.  They both come with fries.  We had excellent service."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab some lunch before my flight, really regretted coming to this place.   I walked in and the majority of the tables were unclean, ( should have set the alarm bells ringing really)  I ordered the truffle fries and a Cesar salad, the truffle fries came without the cheese and truffle oil, so I asked for that additionally once they arrived.   Then my Cesar salad arrived, it was basically a plate of lettuce which had definitely seen better days- lots of brown pieces! The dressing came in a plastic, which I had to put on myself- honestly for $11 it was nothing better than lettuce with a store brought Cesar salad dressing over it.   I complained and they took the salad off, but very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick bite before my flight back home and hindsight I would have been better served just going hungry. It's airport food so the expectations are pretty low to begin with. I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar and my coworker ordered the Cobb salad. Mine was terrible. No croutons, the chicken was dry and obviously previously cut and frozen. I honestly think it is literally prepackaged salad from a bag. To cap it off the dressing came in a little individual serving size plastic bag I could buy at the grocery store. The salad was $14you would think they could put a little effort into it. I know I wouldn't want my name attached to this restaurant if I was a chef. To top it off my coworkers salad was bad as well and she had to pick our her ken's salad dressing as well. Skip this place convenience is over rated walk the extra 50 feet for anything else."}
{"text":"Food is okay... So the one star goes to that, but the service is terrible!!! The First Lady was just slow, but she was the only one working at that time, so I don't blame her, then the food takes over 30 mins to come... Fine! But the lady who bring the food over is just rude!!!! Putting 2 salad dish on table, one with feta, one without, didn't bother to ask who wants the one without the feta cheese, then once we ask her which is which, she just say that's the one without the feta! Move it over! I was like... Wth.. Is this how you talk to the customer!?! U remind me of those cafeteria lady back in high school... I must give you a bad review for that!!!"}
{"text":"No lunch menu items at 9am and the breakfast selections was limited and expensive.   I should have gone to Ruby's Diner where I get more value for breakfast.  Not a good experience and disliked the food - won't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Not a bad option if you feel the need to eat at McCarran. Plenty of beer and liquor options and I found my menu item pretty fairly priced. For 12.95 I got the Big Pretzel Paninni. A nicely seasoned chicken breast with bacon and provolone was tasty and filling and the pretzel bread was wonderful. It comes with \"Chefter\" fries which come dressed with Asiago and scallions. They were ok but sounded better than they tasted. The sandwich I ordered and for the price would be something I would order outside the airport. So definitely a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Typical airport restaurant with ok food, it is not the greatest but certainly not the worst.     This is a busy place as there are not a lot of sit down places available right now, Wanda was our server and she was awesome.  They definitely work hard here, but like I said the food is just ok.  The best part of this place is they full bar they have.  It is a place that is trying to be above the rest and tries to have gourmet food, but it is not gourmet.    The prices are typical airport prices unfortunately the food does not match the price but in the airport when you are hungry, the choices for good quality food just does not exist."}
{"text":"Looked good but was just OK  I stopped by Burke in the Box on my way back from a conference.  I needed something I could bring on the plane with me.  I grabbed a chicken caesar salad, a bottled water, and pack of small chocolate chip cookies.  The salad was just ok.  It came with lame Ken's Caesar salad dressing (they didn't even have their own dressing!).  The chicken was ok but was not precut fully so difficult to eat.  The parmesan cheese was flavorless.  The cookies were buttery but not that memorable otherwise and were TINY.  The meal cost me $19.  Ridiculous.  For a modest salad, a water, and tiny pack of mini cookies.  Very lame."}
{"text":"Wow, this was terrible. I decided to try this figuring it had to be at least slightly better than the typical airport fare because of the \"Top Chef\" name on the sign. It was worse. Don't waste your money.  Pizza, worse than frozen, with too much tasteless pepperoni. Salad with packaged dressing and too much \"parmesan cheese\" on top, again, tasteless. They should have used half the ingredients and doubled the quality."}
{"text":"14 dollars for a frozen patty. Cheese fries were mediocre at best.  Only redeeming quality about this place was the nice bartender.  Don't know how this place is still in business"}
{"text":"Worst Cobb salad I ever had. Lettuce was rotten, and they had to bring me another. Toppings were bland too--cold chicken, whole cherry tomatoes, thick big slices of cucumber, tiny sprinkle of blue cheese crumbles and 3 olives. Worst part was the salad dressing is served in plastic squeeze packets...guess that means it isn't house-made. Being airport food, I wasn't expecting greatness, but this is about as bad as a salad can get, and it has the airport markup $$$$. My server was really nice though. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Walked in this morning and asked a waitress if the restaurant was open seating; she said yes, and I took a seat next to the table she was cleaning up after. Said waitress then proceeded to greet and take the drink orders of two tables that arrived after me. When I approached a manager at the POS to let her know I wasn't being served, she offered an apology and said someone would be over right away. The same waitress, Amber,  slammed my silverware on the table and walked off without a word; returned to sloppily set down my drink and (again) walk away without a word. While waiting for my food, I stopped her to ask for my check and for her to not return to my table. What a way to start my morning.  The manager took over service at my table, and she was as sweet as can be but... I ordered a Margherita flatbread and got plain cheese instead. I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"What a surprise !!!!!!!!!!!! Traveled back to DC and had a late lunch time flight and what a shock to find this place. Who would think you would find asiago & truffled French fries in an airport restaurant. Burger was tasty and well seasoned as was the ruben. Wait staff were friendly and prompt, very quick with the soda and tea refills. Have a place for lunch now when travelling back from Vegas."}
{"text":"Talk about overpriced airport food.  This place takes the cake."}
{"text":"Airport pizza sounds like a horrible combination of words, and it usually is. This place was actually decent and not too expensive. Not something you'd drive 100 miles for, but still, this is definitely the best of the bunch."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews and I see that the place doesn't have a good reputation with yelpers. I'm guessing that Breakfast might be a better meal to get to vs doing anything else.    I had no trouble getting seating, though I did wait about 8 minutes until the waitress came over to me and took my order. Once my order was in, it was only 5-6 minutes before my Big pretzel sandwich came out.  I was surprised, it really was large, and the food was fresh, honestly I expected the worst in comparison to what I'd been reading.   The hash browns were SO good, and the pretzel sandwich was tasty. I ate about 2/3rds before I gave up on it and just ate all the bacon!  The bun would have been better if it had been 1. toasted and 2. salted, but that's just preference.   The coffee was good, rich and plentiful, and the waitress topped me off before I left the place. So all in all, a good visit."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have EVER had. We ordered cheese fries, the waitress delivered regular fries, nbd we clarified we wanted cheese fries. A few minutes later she returned with \"cheese fries\" that appeared to be the same fries with cheese sprinkled on them. When I asked about the completely unmelted cheese, I was told \"this is how we serve them here.\"  When I explained I had never been served cheese fries that the cheese was not melted at all, she reiterated that is how it is done here, and asked if I wanted a manager. So I said yes. The manager backed the server that that is normal and if we didn't like it they would comp it, after again arguing over the cheese not being melted. She says it melts naturally, and when asked about an oven to melt she said they do not have an oven. When asked how they cook the pizza, she offered to comp our entire check. I absolutely hate to complain at a restaurant. But this experience was so bad that I downloaded the yelp app to share. I have never had a server, and then manager, argue with me over a clearly f'd dish!!!"}
{"text":"It is typical airport food and prices. I had the big pretzel breakfast sandwich. It was good, just nothing I would seek out. You can't really go wrong with eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"Five stars to Tony. Everyone else that works the bar/restaurant side is present and adequate but this guy Tony does everything in the place and how he is able to do it all without losing his cool on customers or the coworkers he runs circles around is the really amazing part. Over $10 (might have even been $12) for a draft Stella is too high. You are better off buying a beer from the \"on the fly\" portion of the spot. Fries are good there too. The rueben panini wasn't so great. Sorry for the harshness. You've got an all star over there. Hope you take care of that guy."}
{"text":"I thought that this place would be at least Ok for breatfast. I got their pretzel bread breakfast sandwich, it was so greasy it was barely edible for me. The hash browns were alright, they were the same ones I had in grammar school. Lots of ketchup helped."}
{"text":"Came by for a drink before my redeye back to NY. Bartender was clearly on some sort of mind altering drug and made it super uncomfortable to even sit and drink because he was regaling us with tales of his exotic cat breeding side hustle."}
{"text":"I will start off this review with anything that has blank in the box as their restaurant names needs to focus on quality rather than... attempted creativity. I'm pretty sure Jack in the Box is a little more up scale with their quality than Burke in the Box. The airport style \"restaurant\" is a sit yourself and wait for server to make their way to you. Menus are at the table, easily noticed, but a misleading water bottle is there as well, with no cups on the table or offered right away. It took about five minutes before we were given the chance to ask for cups before the server returned with two cups filled with tap water. Good to know it's really not self serving water unless you want to purchase it. Is that supposed to be an attempt at being classy?? Well we ordered appetizer and when the food got to the table, we had the cheese (asiago and truffle oil) fries, we were then asked if we wanted silverware. Well... maybe that would be a good idea... at least our own plates by now??? Drinks are pricy and not worth it with it's lackluster selection... overall fries were steak fries cut and pretty... neutral. Bland more so.  My boyfriend orders the ULTIMATE BURGER. I got the tomato soup. Soup came out first, as expected, but considering its clearly an entree I'd expect it to come out relatively the same time as my boyfriends food. Common sense? Doesn't take a long time to prepare soup... Oh, but it's okay because our server told us a burger cooks longer... obviously. You mean the same burger you didn't ask what temperature he'd like his patty cooked to?? I took one sip and... I understand soup is composed of various spices and purée or stock or what have you but... this tasted purely of sugar... I couldn't even muster the will to get through another bite. The perks of her bringing my soup to me early though I guess. So then, my boyfriend gets his ULTIMATE BURGER, where the only modifications he made was no tomato, add bacon and blue cheese cheese option, and it comes out as a dry and pathetic display of... a lettuce patty bun bacon and blue cheese slob. Um... are there any spices on the patty? Looks very plain considering it's names ultimate. After our server dropped it off I asked for another soup. You can't force me to eat synthetically sweetened tomato slosh. It was pink, so there might have been more cream than base... Thankfully she took it away from my sights and I requested for a different soup. The beef chili!!! Who can mess up a chili??? Oh yes, Burke in the Box can!   My boyfriend could not finish his food. This place that CLAIMS to \"blaze across distinctions between chef, artist, entrepreneur, and artist\" could not make a simple \"sandwich\", their \"ultimate burger\" look appealing to a starving homeless person, let alone the prices would scare anyone away who does not want to throw away their money after surviving in Vegas. Seriously, gamble your money at the slot machines before gambling with their quality here!!! And even so... go to some place without \"in the Box\" in their name. Jack is wayyy more appealing. Is it foreshadowing that if you eat there you'll have enough food to put in an entire to go Box to only throw it away? Oh... no one gets to go boxes because they never want to see this puke-inducing food again. No one will ever be drunk enough to enjoy anything from this experience.  So, chili was a fail, I only ate the crackers they gave me that I sprinkled onto the soup for flavoring. Added salt... didn't help. Pretty damn bland. I completely abandoned the hopes of finding anything that should be SOOOOOO simple to make as anything decent to consume there. The crackers were nice since there was no connection in the making with an \"in the box\" company. And as hungry as my boyfriend was he could only eat 2/3rds of his burger, in which he claims that the ONLY flavor from the burger was the blue cheese.  Barely saw my server. Since food was so terrible I can only assume all the back of house was smart and left, so the front of house had to make the food. Actually, this place should be shut down and seriously bring in a Mexican restaurant. Any will do because all the food options were probably as bad as Burke in the Box. And as young as we are I don't think my boyfriends recent heartburn is anything else but this food related. So... fooders beware of Burke in the Box... it's really bad."}
{"text":"I was hungry in the airport and saw this place near my gate. I later found out it has horrible reviews! However, my experience was not that bad.  I ordered a split bottle of Prosecco and their margarita pizza. I enjoyed my wine and pizza. It was light and thin crusted. I ordered mine with extra basil. The only negative that I had before ordering the pizza, is that I couldn't get any fresh Parmesan cheese. They only offered peppers.  Now this is not fine dining by any means - this is a sit in restaurant. If you are trying to make a close connection, I would advise you not order here because they do take time in preparing the food. Definitely not fast. They do have a station where you can buy food to go. I don't know if I try this place again. I wouldn't mind eating here again plus they had a great wine list for a restaurant location."}
{"text":"Came in and was not too busy. We sat ourselves and there's a button on the table you can push for service. Didn't have to wait to long for our food. Everything we ordered was quite good for airport food. And the price was decent. Jessica was an awesome server."}
{"text":"A new low, even by airport standards.  The \"double\" drinks were still pretty weak (seemed like I was just drinking a $12 single), and the pizza was the absolute worst one I've ever had.  Wouldn't be surprised to find they were frozen ones being microwaved in the next room.  I ordered the prosciutto and arugula one.  It ended up being a flat tasteless (frozen looking) cheese pizza with a pile of \"toppings\" thrown on top on the middle. Not cooked onto the pizza -- cold on top.  The prosciutto tasted like it had gone bad, so I ended up just pushing it off the piece I ate.    Service was really poor, too.  I was sitting at the bar, and it took over 10 minutes to get the bartender to take my drink order.  He waited on literally everyone else who arrived after me, while avoiding making eye contact.  Finally, he acknowledged me by saying \"did you need something?\"  Do people often sit down at the bar if they don't want a drink?  $40 for pizza and two drinks.  Never again."}
{"text":"Decent place for a quick bite if you're at the Vegas airport. Friendly service, and the food is not bad for airport food.   I was quite happy with their vegan wrap, and my husband liked the breakfast. My wrap was packed with lots of mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and mixed greens. Everything seemed a little on the pricey side, but it is the airport, and the portions are pretty big. I ate half for breakfast, then packed up the other half to eat on the plane."}
{"text":"quick lunch before a flight...sports on the screens...a bar for drinks...tables for dining...taking a soda $3.99 and reuben $12.39...steep prices for a soda, but with quick refills...sandwich quite small....pastrami quite chewy...fries decent...$21 total after tax and tip...seeing a hot dog at a neighboring table and quite impressed with the size...if you are hungry and just want something super filling, get the hot dog or sausage...that was monstrous..."}
{"text":"Goodness, one of the worse ways to spend $14.82 on the saddest salad ever. Nearly nonexistent services. I've had better salads at quick fast food joints. I don't mind spending the money if it's good, but boy was it a sad sad Chicken Caesar Salad. First off, should have left the moment I sat down when I waited 15 mins and no one wanted to take my order. The 2 servers would rather chit chat. So I went to the bartender to put in my order. Order just a salad before my flight. I'll tell ya, it was literally romaine mixed in with a few brown pieces of romaine, a few pieces of chicken, a few flakes cheese and 2 packets of Hellmann's Caesar dressing. I get it if I got my order to go, give me my dressing on the side. If I'm dining in, and paying $14.82, my salad better be mixed with the dressing with croutons. Nope, for $14.82, you get no croutons with 2 packets dressing that you can get at your local gas station for 50 cents a piece. Nope, you are better off buying a bag of salad kits from Dole. How in the world do you screw up on salad, Burke In A Box. Fail."}
{"text":"I thought it was just okay. In the D terminal of United you really dont get that many options so I went here for a burger. The waitress was quick and although she didnt ask how I wanted my burger cooked it still came out medium which made me happy. For two burgers and two tap waters the bill came out to $35. Yikes a little pricey yes but like I said I didnt' have much of a choice. After the fact I realized that I should've just used their to-go stand and purchased a pre-made sandwich.  I will say that their breakfast menu sounds pretty delicious so if I was stuck in the D terminal again before 10:30am I wouldn't mind giving it a whirl."}
{"text":"We had lunch here as we waited for our plane. Our waitress was very nice.  I asked for a substitution and she was accommodating. DMD ordered the chicken wrap and I ordered a turkey Reuben. The chicken wrap was reported as very good. The Reuben was ok. Not enough sour kraut, but maybe that was a good thing. There is a full bar and plenty of TV's."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and average.  Staff is rude.  Asked to watch an NCAA game, as one channel was just playing sportscenter (and no one watching) and they refused to change it. Overall a bad experience!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here to grab some breakfast before our flight back home. I ordered some coffee and it was nice because it was served in a paper cup (Seattle Best). I could of took it with me for later if I wanted to.   I ordered a pretzel breakfast sandwich without cheese. It was honestly missing something but I can't put my taste buds on it. Plus some cheese had snuck into my sandwich. The hash browns were on point and I could of ate them all day. Add salt and ketchup.   Our meal came out within 10 minutes of ordering. It took a little time to get extra water and coffee but honestly I was thirsty.  The meal was little overpriced but I do realize that we were in an airport."}
{"text":"I get it.  Airport food is not fine dining.  No big expectations.  This stuff reminds me of something out of a microwave --- in fact I'm pretty sure that is how they make it.  I'm not exaggerating.  It was bad.  I had a pizza that was worse than cheap grocery store frozen pizza.  I very rarely do the one start thing.... but this is really a warning to other yelpers.  I felt bad for the servers because they were nice and helpful, but they are in a place with bad food.  I actually found myself hoping my nice server would get a job somewhere that might give her better tips from better food."}
{"text":"I know not to expect much from airport food establishments but this one is a low. Not good. Cold and not tasty at all and too pricey."}
{"text":"Extremely rude. The waitress passed us up 5 times without greeting us. When we finally ASKED her to place an order, she said \"I'll get him in a bit.\" \"He\" never came, so we just left.   Do NOT go to this place. Horrible service, I wont comment on the food because I wasn't given an opportunity to try it. We sat there for 16 minutes while she serviced the TWO tables RIGHT next to us."}
{"text":"Gourmazing is not a good description. Over cooked breakfast sausage and the brioche toast is really just Texas toast. Airport food usually is sub par though. Service was great and friendly otherwise one star would be the score."}
{"text":"Wow -- skip it!  Airport food should be relatively fast -- the folks here have a very limited menu, and no real efficiency getting the orders out in a timely manner!  I probably should have waited in the cage line down the hall -- the one with about 25 people in line -- wait time would have been about the same -- food choices better  Don't worry, folks -- Burke Box won't be here long!!"}
{"text":"Take a cheese pizza that looks like it was frozen at one point, throw cold arugula and cold chunks of prosciutto, then charge $14 for it.  Lazy attempt and not worth it....    I saw other reviews about the pizza after the fact, so I think we're all in agreement.  Worst pizza ever.    If there was such a thing as a 0 star, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Batshit crazy waitress, dirty tables, below average food. Stay away!  Mr. Burke, your box is scary."}
{"text":"Flight was delayed so I stopped by to order some food. Had the margherita pizza and tuna sliders. It was overpriced and only decent but I was expecting that for airport food. Luckily for me I had some food vouchers because of the flight delay so didn't have to pay much."}
{"text":"Status quo airport bar/restaurant.  The bartender had zero personality.  Almost felt sorry for him.  Lol!  He was doing a great job on up selling everyone on an extra shot, or shots in general.  I just had water, and my husband had 2 drinks.  It's not much to write about, but I would give another place a try if I'm in the same terminal again.  Another one of the employees (a woman) kept talking really loud about a customer that came intoxicated or something of the sort and she was pretty annoying.  I noticed a couple other people at the bar that seemed annoyed by her."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant while waiting for my flight back to NYC from Las Vegas.  I tried this restaurant because I am familiar with the David Burke restaurants in NYC and always enjoyed the food. I didn't go for the sit down service but instead I chose to get take out.  The service was prompt and courteous at the take out counter. I tried the pretzel Panini meal which I thought was pretty good but too much for me to eat in one sitting. The pretzel bun was warm and soft. The grilled chicken, bacon and provolone combination was delicious and filling but I didn't think my meal could compare with any meal that I've had at one of his restaurant in the past. The food was just OK but definitely didn't live up to what I have experience in the past from a David Burke restaurant. The only thing that remained consistent was the high price of my meal which David Burke restaurants are definitely known for."}
{"text":"Honestly, the worst pizza I've ever had. I couldn't even separate the slices. Tostinos puts this place to shame.   Also, everything on or in styrofoam? Are dishes that difficult?"}
{"text":"Decent airport french fries.  Huge order -- more than one person can finish.   Don't forget the packets of salt."}
{"text":"Questo posto ha reso felice il mio pranzo all'aereoporto.  Nascosto alla fine del gatte D, mi sono fermata per pranzo attratta dalla scritta \"gourmet azing\" e dalle foto dello Chef David Burke (per me perfetto sconosciuto) riportata in ogni tavolo.   Ok fast food ma con gusto. Io e il mio ragazzo abbiamo preso una cobb salad buonissima con uova bacon e gorgonzola. Eravamo indecisi sulle salse da provare e la cameriera gentilissima mi ha portato tutto il cestino al tavolo, lasciando lì per le mie sperimentazioni.  Abbiamo preso un Burger e 2 birre, le porzioni sono molto grandi ma devo ammettere che è molto caro.  Contestualizzato con i prezzi di un aereoporto non è la fine del mondo! Molto carine le alzatine in plastica, ma persono l'acqua che trovate sul tavolo e' a pagamento."}
{"text":"My chicken 'pretzel panini' sandwich was decent enough.  I was flying early, and the non-breakfast menu was limited around 10am, but this was decent, didn't make me sick, and was prepped quickly.  In reality this restaurant is probably a 2-star affair, but it gets 3 for the airport.  There are probably better options at LAS but definitely worse.  I may return, but not looking forward to it :-)"}
{"text":"The Big Pretzel Panini consisted of grilled chicken, provolone, bacon, lettuce and tomato served on a pretzel bread roll.  It was served with fries and a pickle wedge.  It sounded great on the menu and in all honesty, it was ok---  not memorable--just ok.  Our waitress was sweet and took good care of us throughout our short stay.   I think we were in and out in half an hour.  It took about 10 minutes for the food to arrive at this airport establishment.  We also shared their margherita thin crust pizza.  Again, it was ok. They don't have any grated cheese if you wanted to sprinkle some on your slices like we did.......  I think we paid $27.00."}
