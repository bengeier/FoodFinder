{"text":"Food is hit or miss.  Service is horrendous, all the time.  Whether sitting with a total of 4 people at the bar and 2 bartenders working or sitting in a booth with a server, the service is not good. I will spare all the details of our last visit but it was bad service (had to go to the bar from our booth to get drinks), bad food (brisket was 50% gristle) and we had tables on either side of us full of dirty dishes for the last 20 minutes we were there. This is management 101. There is a manager who seems to spend most of her time as a food expediter rather than managing the restaurant.  She'll walk right by you and your empty glass in the bar and not say a word.  Not even hi.  I don't get it.  I wish it was better. The place will survive just because of location and the sheer volume of need here but under any other circumstances it would be a year or two at most."}
{"text":"Impressed. Definitely impressed after the reviews I read. The staff was very friendly, the food was just excellent. Tvs all around if you want to watch a game. Great pub food. Endless selection of beers (I recommend the killians Irish red). Quick service, not a long wait at all. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My expectations were a little low based on the reviews and 3 star rating.  I'm glad we decided to give it a try anyways.  The food was great. I had the grilled fish tacos and they were up there with some of the best I've had and are under $10! My husband had the brisket burger and liked it.  The kids meals are well priced.  We also tried the meat lovers pizza as an appetizer and it was good.  We will definitely go back.  I would have given 5 stars, however for a new restaurant I'd like to see a more exciting menu, items are a little boring and same you'd see at any burger restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, good service, great location!

Went for dinner and drinks with my boyfriend here on a Wednesday afternoon. They're building a patio, so there's construction. That didn't interfere with the inside though. 

The waitress knew the menu INSIDE & OUT! She said she's tried everything on the menu for 2 things. She suggested I try the Carolina Berry Vodka Sour Martini, and I say it is a MUST TRY!

For starters my boyfriend had a ceasar salad, while I tried the spinach dip with nachos & pita bread. Oh-my, let me tell you the pita bread was the PERFECT side for the dip! It was warm and had a buttery taste to it, I was instantly addicted!

My boyfriend wanted ribs, but they weren't going to be available until dinner time, so he ordered Crispy Southern Chicken Sandwich, which came with 2 tiny chicken pieces on each roll. My boyfriend said it was ok because he hates bothering the waiter, but he is 6'3 and 235, and that was not going to fill him up. I asked the waiter if he could have more chicken on his sandwich, and they brought it out with no problem and no charge!

I opted for a cheesburger with chili, bbq, lettuce, and mustard. I loved it! The chili was so-so, but the burger itself was juicy, and delicious!

We ended the dinner with a shot which topped off our experience!

Will I go back to Carolina Ale House? Of course! And you should too!"}
{"text":"Tasty. Service was prompt. Appreciated the TVs to watch games on. Food was good for a brewery."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of beer.  But their own brand of pale ale is my favorite.  Food is excellent.  Best burgers hands down."}
{"text":"Service at the bar was very slow for me, or I would have gave this place a 3 instead of a 2. If you are in the mood for a good craft beer or to listen to the game, then this is definitely the place to go. The food is not that impressive, mostly wraps and sandwiches, but on the flip side they are priced accordingly and you will not spend that much. Lost a star on service and also lost a star on food. If they get a better menu and bartender staff they are almost there, just need to change a few things around.

PS: Also update your TV'S.. Half of them around the bar are all fuzzy and outdated."}
{"text":"First time visit and I definitely won't be back. 

The wings I ordered were lukewarm at best and not very good. Poor food quality.

My server was okay, but this didn't overcome the fact that there were dirty dishes stacked up in the dining area when I first walked in and when I was leaving. Not a good indicator of cleanliness or sanitary conditions.

I also saw a server wipe his mouth with his bare hand and then with the same hand hold a glass by the area where some is going to put their mouth. This happened at least twice. I mean really?  This is pretty disgusting. 

I don't think anyone in thus restaurant values the importance of proper hand washing. Or they really just don't care. And I don't think management or ownership cares about food quality either. I do know I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Rarely write reviews but was compelled to share our experience from our visit which is our first as we just moved to Fort Mill.  A coworker suggested we try this place.  We visited on a Friday, it was busy but not packed, 2 adults and 2 kids, we walked in and got a table right away.  We liked the ambiance and feel of the restaurant and were excited to try some of the craft beers they offer.  The hostess sat us, they had an activity sheet and crayons for kids so that was good, family friendly with young kids.  We sat at table for 20 mins before the waiter first came over.  We asked for a drink menu.  Big mistake.  Another 15 mins went by before we got that, we ordered the kids food then and said to come back in a few mins so we could choose a beer and order our food.  Another 15 mins goes by, he comes back and takes our orders.  We wait another 15 mins, no drinks, no food.  A different waitress that was helping the table across from us actually stopped by and asked if we had been helped, we explained to her what happened.  She asked what drinks we ordered, left and came back with them in 30 seconds.  The food finally arrived.  My order was wrong, there was no way I was sending it back after this fiasco.  By now our kids were fed up and getting antsy, we we all at as fast as we can.  At one point in the waiting, someone who we think was the manager stopped at the table with food that wasn't ours and we told her we had been waiting excessively, she had a blank look on her face, didn't say anything and just walked away.  Wow, thanks for the help.  We will definitely NOT be back based on our experience.  Would giving 1 star for the waitress who stepped in and got us our drinks, otherwise it was a 0 star experience.  :("}
{"text":"Lots of good beer and awesome food. Next time I visit Charlotte I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Actually a pleasant surprise. 
I didn't expect a sports bar type place in the southeast to have a gluten-free menu, but they did. Not only did they have it, but it had options for appetizers and entr√©es. 

So, the quick review...
Gluten-free: Yes, they offer it and yes, most of the people working there that I encountered understood what that meant. (I say \"most\" since I did get a Caesar salad with my meal that had croutons on it. It was probably a confused order in the kitchen, but salads are easy to spot. Had that been other dish where the sauce or something is less obvious, that could have caused a problem.)

Service: Friendly, fast, responsible. 

Food: Pretty typical sports-bar food. Nothing great, but not bad either. If you're at a sports bar, you're there to drink beer and watch TV. The food is background and the portions are appropriately large to make sure everyone gets full. 

Beer: I mentioned this separately because one thing for sure that you don't expect at a place like this is a gluten-free beer selection. You expect the \"sorry, but we have hard liquor,\" or \"we have cider.\" This place actually has a gluten-free beer section that's separate from ciders, but let's face it, cider is NOT beer. Now, the downside to this is that the Estrella Damm Daura they put here isn't really gluten-free for celiacs. It will work if you're gluten-free for stylistic or lifestyle reasons, but celiacs will definitely get a negative reaction from this brew. (Not necessarily Carolina Ale House's fault since Estrella still advertises its product as gluten-free,  even though the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) will not let them put the gluten-free label on their beer.)

Still, Carolina Ale House tries to accommodate, and if anything, they should asterisk the Estrella so that the celiacs vs. the lifestyle GFs can make the best decisions."}
{"text":"Large selection of draft beers, great wings and a diverse menu. Thai chili wings and honey BBQ were excellent. Wifey had a salad which good too. Plenty of TVs to catch the games."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in tonight's experience (likely the last). Apparently several cooks called in sick and a bartender quit. So things moved slowly. But what was most disappointing and completely wrong was that we requested to speak with the manager and 30+ minutes later and after a few excuses from the bartender, the manager never made it over. Perhaps it was because everyone took turns complaining but she did not handle it well. So, we left without ever being handled. Hey Carolina Ale House (Kingsley), your business will succeed or fail more on customer service than food and beer. This was an epic fail, in my and my families opinion. Back to our other local favorites that actually care about their customer."}
{"text":"Average food that you can find anywhere but nice scenery. Hopefully the food gets better"}
{"text":"I ordered the daily special, which was the southern fried chicken bowl.  Was good, but a little salty.  I went with 3 other coworkers on a Tuesday night @7pm and service was very, very slow. Had to track someone down twice to ask for forks to go with our salads.  Had to flag someone down twice for our bill.  Not a good place to go if you have less than 2 or 3 hours only to eat."}
{"text":"Concord definitely needs more places like this. It is a wonderful sports bar. I think they have enough TVs to show every sporting event that is occurring across the globe! 

The outdoor patio is very inviting. It was almost tranquil, which was a pleasant surprise for a sports bar. Our sever, Mike, was very friendly and accommodating. 

The food is standard bar food. We had drinks and appetizers: spinach artichoke dip and dry rub chicken wings.  We both got the drink special: a bay breeze for $4.50. Initially, the drinks were a bit watered down. Our waiter, gladly returned the drinks and got us new ones, which were better. 

The only drawback to this place is they didn't have the volume on for the football games. It's the beginning of college football season, so I expected to be able to view and listen to the game. The bar showed a bunch of games, but played music in the background. I asked the waiter if they could turn on the volume for the football game and she stated \"I don't think they ever play the game over the speakers, just music.\" I can only hope that she is mistaken. I can't imagine them continuing this policy through football season, especially for Panthers games. I'll give them one more try."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. We have gone on 3 different occasions, and it just never works out. First time, it took almost 10 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us. The second time, we couldn't get the correct refills ( I ordered a Sprite and she kept giving me water), the third time the guy forgot both of our salads and our beers that we ordered. Three strikes and your out, luckily there are plenty of other places to get bar food."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever! I called in for a to go order they told me it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I took 35-45 minutes to get there. When I got there they said they had no order under my name. When the manager came and spoke to me I told him I had called multiple times and he went to check with the host. Apparently the host never passed on my order so I sat there and waited for 1.5 hours until I got my food! DONT COME TO THIS PLACE, absolute waste of time."}
{"text":"First time being here with my bf. Food was 20/10! It was so good. The fries were the best fries we have ever had and our waitress, Rihanna. She was the best we have ever had!! I called today and told the manager how amazing she was! Defiantly going back soon!!"}
{"text":"I wish they would get good management as it has great potential. They are always out of things, and they recently took the Carolina barbecue loaded fries off the menu, one of the best food items they have. This place has quickly gone down hill since opening and it is a shame. I will not be back unless they get it together! I mean they were out of Dr. Pepper , that is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Slow service and mediocre food.  Waitress never came back to refill our drinks.  I ordered chicken tacos.  They were so dry.  Needed a sauce or something and was missing the slaw.  Husband had the fried chicken and seemed to like it.  Fries were pretty good.  Kids had pizza and macaroni.  Pizza was terrible and macaroni was watery."}
{"text":"Bad food and poor service! It took forever for the server to come order our drinks, then forever again to get our drinks... then forever to get our not so good food... the group of friends I came with and myself believed out server was high on someting! Hilarious but it does explain the lack of service.. poor service overal."}
{"text":"This place sucked , wanted to take my husband here for a date night and was extremely mortified by the food and the horrible service.  We weren't sure if we were going to eat dinner also, so we just started with appetizers and drinks first. We ordered our drinks and Fried pickles as a appetizer. When the food ,finally came out , it was like they had just taken the pickles out of the jar and fried them for one minute. They were so soggy and were still so juicy. When my husband said something to the waitress she rudely replied \" That's how a pickle is supposed to taste. \" I mean come on Bi**h , I'm not two I know how a pickle is supposed to taste and I know that a fried pickle is not supposed to taste that juicy and at least be fried a little. We were very disappointed so we got the check and left. That's what happens when you have a bunch of young kids working."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to CAH on Sunday's for the NFL games. We always ask for Trey because he's such a great server! The food is always great and we get a good laugh in while watching the games. Great spot for sports and they have every beer under the sun."}
{"text":"Decent looking place but in desperate need of new manager.  Know I came in near the end of normal dinner time but since downstairs was jammed tried the top level.  Half the staff was sitting at a table in the back instead of trying to earn some money.  Likely with the guy who calls himself the manager ... wow smh"}
{"text":"Get the picky platter and you can sub cheese fries and get the chicken fingers tossed in buffalo. Super pick platter ;) & their spinach dip & pita is amazing."}
{"text":"Went there for a few drinks during Sunday night football.  It was packed and fun time.  Service was exceptional.  Kelli took care of us all night and did an amazing job"}
{"text":"Just had a bad experience here. Our server was very slow, which was aggravating enough, and it took a long time to get served our beers.  Then we waited way a long time for our food. To top it off, they got my husbands order wrong. We did not stay for them to fix it. Waste of time!"}
{"text":"Just as the Yelp rating states its ok.  Pretty much standard or typical bar food.  I was interested in trying out this place only because from the outside they have a pretty nice set up a ton of outdoor seating, big and spacious, but it never came across as a place that I would eat with my kids, even though they have a kids menu and passing by I've seen other patrons with kids, but it just never appealed to me as a kid friendly restaurant.  It could be because from the outside all you can see is a huge outside bar with seating.

I am not a beer drinker, so I can't rate the beers and you must be wondering why did I even want to try it?  Well, I thought that I might have another food spot to add to my list of regulars, but not this one.  We ordered the Classic Philly Cheese Steak and a Bacon Cheeseburger with fries.  The Philly Cheese Steak tasted a little bland, if it weren't for the onions and peppers it would have tasted like a cardboard box and the Bacon Cheeseburger was ok, nothing outstanding.

The waitress was nice and attentive, pretty much doing her job, again nothing outstanding.  Overall the experience was not bad but it was not memorable. I'm not in a rush to go back, especially when there are so many other options close by."}
{"text":"Y'all, THE VEGGIE BURGER. I actually prefer Carolina Ale House's use of a Morningstar Farms patty topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheese, onion rings, and barbecue sauce over the homemade versions most places disappoint with. Also, lets talk about the fries, which were salty perfection. $2 beer pints (err, they ran out of Magic Hat #9) and this place was a great stop before and after the Pearl Jam concert!"}
{"text":"Didn't receive silverware or napkins, got my food before my beer, asked the server for napkins and silverware twice once we had our food and eventually asked a manager we saw walking by and he got them for us right away, my girlfriend didn't even get her food until some of us were already done eating.....horrible service"}
{"text":"Great place, drinks and bar food were pretty good. Came by when I was in town for the weekend to watch the game."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We were hesitant to go after reading some less-than-stellar recent reviews, so we made other plans for dinner. The next day, however, it wasn't too crowded and we decided to give it a try. Bad decision. Waited about 20 minutes to have anyone even make it to our table to bring water or take a drink order. After that we ordered drinks and food right away, then waited about 40 more minutes for food to arrive. Waitress was very inattentive. Two of us went a good portion of our meal out of our drinks. She didn't come around to ask about refills until we had been waiting for quite a while to get our bill, everyone having long-finished our meals. Food was fine, but nothing special, prices were so-so. There are too many amazing places to eat in downtown Charlotte. Don't waste the time here!"}
{"text":"Dropped in because we wanted a place that had decent bar food, lots of draft beer choices and was showing the Michigan - Ohio State game.  CAH served us well on all accounts. Husband had the dry rub grilled wings and loved them. I had the boneless buffalo wings which were very good. All wings were better than b-dubs. Service was friendly and prompt, what more could you want from a server?  Wish I could remember his name so I could call him out. His teams were all undefeated so far. Would definitely drop in again if we were passing through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Service is so slow!!!  We just ordered burgers, fries and drinks...how long does that take?  Also, the mixed drinks are so weak.  I had to ask if there was alcohol in the drinks.  I really wanted this to be a place where we could hang out and have a good time but with the service and food, we will keep looking."}
{"text":"The only saving grace is the beer selection and TVs to keep you distracted for how uninspiring the food is."}
{"text":"There were 22 in our group. We made reservations many days in advance and called 2 times before we arrived. Service - SUCKED!!  One waiter - you are kidding me!  Stay away. Charlotte has great restaurants and this is NOT one of them."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at the Carolina Ale House.The service was fast and friendly. All of our food, with the exception of the mashed potatoes, was excellent. Prices are good for the amount of food that you get. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great experience! So happy to have this restaurant in Fort Mill. Greeters and servers were exceptionally nice and the food was excellent- surprising for such a new restaurant location! Will recommend Carolina Ale House at Kingsley to everyone!"}
{"text":"The service here has never been great but tonight our server took at least 20 minutes to even come to our table introduce herself and get our drink order.  When she looked my husbands ID, she refused to accept it because it had a scratch on it and after showing the manager, he refused as well.  We even showed him a credit card with his full name on it as proof.  He is rarely ID'd BC he's in his late 20s and has a full man beard but even so, he's never had any problems with his ID.  On top of that, we hung around for a bit to decide whether to stay or not but our waitress never came back!   If you're looking for good hang out bar, there are plenty of other bars with better food, better beer and much better service in the area..."}
{"text":"Silly rules in this place. My boyfriends mom couldn't get an alcoholic drink because she didn't have ID. She is 50. Really? But my Long Island iced tea is amazing! Only came for drinks so that's all I can say."}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte for a convention. Got in super late. Ale house kitchen was open until 2 am, so we decided to go there for our first time. 

The food was great and very well priced. Large portion. Deep fried cheese curds are amazing.

The best part though is the amazing staff. Darrian and Kaytea have impeccable service and are some of the most kind servers I've ever seen.

The bartender Chubbs made some awesome drinks and was super friendly. The management checked often to make sure everything was great.

This place was such a good time we came back 4 days in a row. In fact I never Yelp anything, and the service, food and just the people made it so that I had to write a review!"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend for a few after dinner drinks and was a bit disappointed. The place was packed but the 2 bartenders were more concerned about talking to their friend or the regulars. The service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"First beer we asked for they were out of. We ordered the nachos and sent them back which is very unlike our personalities. The nachos were mediocre at best. There is such incredible food selections in uptown Charlotte we didn't want to stay. Service was good and if you want to catch a game on tv this is a good spot."}
{"text":"A little thing called \"Service\" would be great, especially on a slow night in this place. It took 10 minutes to be greeted and get a drink. Then when I order, I ask for a \"Starting salad\" before my food came out....to my surprise my food came before my salad and I sent the salad back. Somehow I knew it was going to happen and it did. I guess starting salad didn't ring a bell. No sorry or anything when my original waitress came back. If you love bad service, come to Ale House in Concord NC."}
{"text":"This was the best experience that I have had in uptown. Kaytea gave me a new idea of service, that raised my standard of what to expect when I go out to eat. I just want to thank her for her effort and want the management to understand the value of this asset."}
{"text":"We  loved our food. I had the pub Burger and my husband had rib chicken combo. Best burger ever. Fries are good. We had pretzels too. Can not complain about the  food. They forgot our fries but brought them out without a problem. Service was a little slow. I had to wait about  10 minutes to get check..I would go back again"}
{"text":"Had the ribs, which was cold and tasteless, seems like the ribs came out of the frig and they slap some barbacue sauce over it and serve.  The calamari appetiizer was ok.  The bar wasn't busy, but yet the bartender was unattentive at all, didn't ask how the food was or even ask if i wanted another beer.  I have to keep asking her rather then them asking if i needed anything or how the food was."}
{"text":"I really hate to write unfavorable reviews, but I feel it is my duty to inform others before they select this restaurant. We have been 4-5 times and I keep thinking it will get better, but I continue to receive poor service & cold food. 

Our most recent visit yesterday was mid-afternoon and we sat outside overlooking the lake. Nice day and hopeful for a successful late lunch. It was not to be. The server was not very efficient & even returned to take our order a second & third time, even though she had taken it previously. After waiting 45 minutes, our food finally arrived - cold to the touch.  This has happened on almost every visit. I doubt I will give them another chance - too bad. They really have some issues that need to be addressed before they continue to lose customers. 

The manager did make an appearance but offered no real solution other than offering to remake everything. When I told him we didn't want to wait longer, he only stated \"well, I will take it off your bill\". No attempt to offer anything to get us to come back."}
{"text":"I have worked in the restaurant business and am a fan of the ale house in Wilmington. So I try to be incredibly patient and understanding. when I saw the one here in uptown it was an easy choice. I leave this review hoping someone one day will use it as motivation to make improvements. There was absolutely no quality control on the food. I got served tainted salmon and the replacement meal took so long to show up I ended up having to get it to go. The waitress I think was doing the best she could but was severely in the weeds. The environment for the employees seemed like an every man for himself scenario. It was painful to watch. If you're in no hurry and only want to drink beer and watch a game then you should be ok here. If you want decent food and service I would advise going somewhere else until this place gets an overhaul."}
{"text":"Locals call it the Snail House, as the staff is notoriously slow and inept.  Mediocre bar food at best.  Falls into the classic trap of having a large menu but not doing anything well. 

While it has an impressive beer list, good luck ordering different beers in a big group, the staff seems incapable of giving the right person the correct beer.  You will spend the next ten minutes tasting everyone beer at your table trying to find yours. 

The location is great with a huge patio and solid atmosphere.  Good place for an after work happy hour or to watch the Game.  Lots of potential but probably needs new menu and staff."}
{"text":"I had some friends in town last night for business and thought CAH would be a good dinner choice...  Not...  Nice looking casual place, multiple bars, TVs, etc...  Basically our waiter was not very friendly and often absent from our area. He seemed stressed out, or having a bad night, maybe too many tables, I blame management for bad service. As far as food:  Fried Onion appetizer was under cooked, mushy, greasy.  2 Tuna Salads requested rare, both cooked well. Grilled wings not grilled at all, appeared oven baked, gummy skin, bland.  I won't be back. There are too many good places to eat in the Charlotte area to put up with this...  I apologized the rest of the evening for my bad restaurant choice.  Sorry again guys..."}
{"text":"Last night before heading to the Marriott - stopped for a quick drink on the patio.  Cool atmosphere but lemon drop martinis were horrible. Certainly didn't expect them to be $10 each. Understand it's an ale house but don't include it on the menu."}
{"text":"The place was really not that busy but the service sucked anyway, i would recommend ordering a pitcher to keep your glass full..try going some where else, this place l sucks"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!! Corporate bullies. They are trying to kill a small business hundreds of miles away over a name they don't even use. Crazy don't support this madness"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? My party of 4 ordered nachos and wings and it took 45 minutes to arrive at our table. 2 orders of wings were cold and so we're the nachos. We spoke to the manager and we're assured the order would be remade correctly. The excuse given was the kitchen staff we're making mistakes. Wings arrived 30 minutes later and the my sauce was wrong. My order was complimentary but not the rest of my party. I will not return again. Not a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Probably the worse ribs we've ever had. Coated with some pasty tomato sauce    Real disappointment."}
{"text":"Wow, just horrible. We were told to wait for our table, a booth, while they cleaned it and reset. Then watched 5 minutes later some dim-witted hostess give it away to another group because she didn't communicate with her coworkers. When we asked the manager about it, she kinda shrugged her shoulders and stated nobody was close to being done. Ummmm, yeah...reason why this place sucks. Put your head on people, these are restaurant basics. Can't run the door properly, then I can't imagine how bad everything else is. Don't even bother."}
{"text":"We sat outside which was nice but service was on the slow side.  My husband's salad said nothing about cucumbers but it had them and the avocados which were mentioned were missing.  My salad was pretty good - Greek Farmer salad with grilled chicken - but nothing great.  It was a decent meal but we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Been here once and won't be back again. The food is ok, what you expect from a place like this - lots of beer on tap, tvs galore and barfood. The service is sloowwwww and not super friendly. The hostesses could use a lesson in manners, but then again she only looked to be about 16, so perhaps there's a chance hat will come in time . I just don't understand how people are ok with waiting an hour to get a table in here. It's mediocre at best."}
{"text":"It was my first time here to celebrate my husband's new job. Sat down, was greeted and drink orders were taken. First round of drinks came and was fine and then he ordered a beers for I ordered a salad. After a couple minutes after ordering the beer, a guy came and sat himself at a table diagonally from us and received his beer just a short few minutes later and my husband's was nowhere to be seen. After about ten minutes, the server came to apologize that the bar had been backed up and that's why we didn't have the drink yet. I put in an order for my beer at this time. I've been serving for years and I knew I had just been lied to after seeing that guy. Either the order wasn't put in or no one had grabbed the beer. I was cool with it up until then. My salad (with burnt fish) had come and gone before we got two beers. And then I got the wrong beer? I received a miller lite instead of the birdsong jalape√±o that I ordered. This wasn't fixed until about 10-15 minutes later. At this point, I just wanted my bill to be paid to go home. I put my $50 on the $35 bill and got my change about 20-30 minutes later to leave my tip and go home. I spent two hours on an ordeal that shouldn't have been any longer than an hour. I was very disappointed and I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"My first experience at the restaurant was bad but I'd figure it may have changed management or got it together since my initial visit. I was on 1 hr lunch break with 2 co-workers,so we ordered our drinks AND placed our orders to cut wait time. WRONG! Our waiter (tall male with long dark pony tailed hair) took 10 minutes to bring our drinks and appetizer (fried pickles were so greasy). Now we're down to 40 minutes to wait for our food and eat. The waiter continued to walk by us like he wasn't our server.. didn't even stop to check to see if we needed anything or tell us what was the hold up on our food. After stopping another waiter to see about our food, the food comes out (we have 10 minutes left to eat). I asked for a manager immediately. My friends salmon looked bit off of (ughh) and the wait was ridiculous when it wasn't packed at all. The manager came over and looked like he wanted to laugh when my friend mentioned her half eaten food. He did discount our food---although we deserved it free. Then it took another 7 minutes to pay us out! Late for work!!!! If you eat there don't be in a rush, eat before you go because the wait is real. It's a nice location to gain lots of customers but they honestly need to hire more cooks, waiters or close down altogether"}
{"text":"I have now been to this establishment twice and can't seem to order anything besides the Pub Burger due to the perfectly cooked pattie, the sharp cheddar, the house made sauce and the topping of onion strings. This burger has rivaled every burger that I have ever had and won hands down. The service deserves all 5 of the stars that I have awarded them as well. My wife is mildly allergic to red onion which was in her wrap when she recieved it. The staff was apologetic, courteous and expedient with resolving the discrepancy. The manager himself brought the corrected entree to her and also apologized to her and told her that her meal would be comped for the mistake. Now that's the level of service that one should expect when spending money at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Best chicken quesadilla I have ever had. Service was horrible. Although the restaurant was not busy, The hostess told me my best option would be at the bar. I took a seat at the dirty bar and waited for 10 minutes before the bar tender acknowledge me and clean my bar top. Then while eating a homeless man came into the bar and asked me to buy him food. I was so bothered I left before I finished my dinner. Highly unlikely that I will return."}
{"text":"We had a group of 10+ and had excellent service from Marie! Great menu, even better beer selection. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times and got 1 meal that was edible. You would think that I would learn. The place is very nice and the staff seems to be doing a good job but the food is mediocre at best. Can't understand why you have to present a credit card before you even get a drink. Makes you feel like a crook so I guess they have a lot of undesirables bolting, not paying their bill. I think 1 out of 3 is enough to keep me from returning."}
{"text":"La carne estaba buen√≠sima y las alitas de pollo tambi√©n. Muy serviciales y atentos. Multitud de opciones de cerveza. Absolutamente recomendable."}
{"text":"Don't plan on planning a private event with them in the upstairs bar as the event manager is \"TOO BUSY\" to get back with you."}
{"text":"Visited this place a few times and had great experiences. The last time I went I ordered fried shrimp, they were overlooked. The waiter cautioned me against getting the shrimp and I should've listened. They quickly replaced my order. Also, I ordered the habanero and buffalo wings....they were excellent. My husband his beer chicken dish."}
{"text":"Best place in downtown Charlotte to catch a game with some friends. Tons of beer, great bar food, and tons of TVs. Get ready for the service to be hit or miss. But that is usually the way things work at these places."}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER and here is why....First I must start by stating, I grew up waiting tables and bartending to pay for college so I am extremely patient when it comes to being in the weeds but this place was off the charts.....So we are from out of town and thought we would try something new and different. We arrived around 12:30 and it was typical lunch hour rush however they seemed to be unusually under staffed for the lunch hour. We sat at the bar because when we arrived there were several people waiting at the host stand and no hostess or manager greeting people and/or taking names so we sat at the bar, knowing from expierence that bartenders are usually the most tenured, however we sat for 10 minutes without even so much as a smile, acknowledgement (eye contact) or hello. So we continued to wait patiently as we see 2 different bartenders pour beer and a food runner (maybe waiter in training, certainly not a manager in training) pass us without making eye contact.  When we finally decided to ask one of the 3 women that we saw behind the bar, we asked the woman that was running food, if she could take our order (because we were hungry and had limited time for lunch) stated to us, \"I am not your server or a server\" we could not hear her clearly because she mutter the words as she continued to walk by us instead of stopping to speak with us and explain that she may not be the server or bartender but \"I will take your order or get you somebody that can\" i.e. it's called customer service. In my opinion, if the bartenders can't handle their own bar, they should not be behind the bar and if the woman that was running food is in training for any position in the restaurant she needs to a little crash course in customer service. When I brought it to the on duty managers attention, he seemed a little overwhelmed and could only apologize instead of making it right."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic and consistent here. The service can be hit or miss depending on the server and whether or not the restaurant is busy. My friends and I come here about every other week. It gets very loud and crowded on game days so be prepared! My boyfriend always gets the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. I highly recommend their chicken quesadilla, fish tacos, or pub burger."}
{"text":"We dropped in for a quick beer and to catch some of the football game. the restaurant was busy, so we grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The bartender was very nice and attentive. 

My 2 stars come from watching the 2 expeditors grabbing food, rearranging food on plates, smashing down buns on hamburgers and sandwiches,  putting handfuls of fries on plates ALL WITHOUT USING ANY GLOVES!! I truly sat a few feet and lost my entire appetite!! 

I think if a health inspector had walked in...they would have lost their licenses!! 
#gross. #wherehavethosehandsbeen"}
{"text":"I'm a wing and salad girl,here the wings are ok salads ok. Not my favorite place, I guess that's why the name is CAH bc food is not what they do!"}
{"text":"Called up and asked how long to sit a party of 14 and was told 10-15 minutes for an indoor seat. Arrived and was asked again for indoor or outdoor seating and was told they were clearing the table for us. 20 minutes later asked how much longer and the same girl asked who I was and how many in my party? 20 minutes later we were led outside!!!manager came over and said he was sorry but clearly wasn't...we ordered drinks anyway waited 15 no drinks and finally we left. Real dum Perth ghetto employees!!!!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly, drinks and food took around 45 minutes to come out. Found what looked like a beard hair in my food. Then when I ask for the check they ask if I would like new food or something off our bill. They give me $5 dollars off my bill. Then had to go downstairs to get someone to ring me out."}
{"text":"Good place to catch a game and brew. Plenty of beers to choose from to go along with pretty tasty food. Friendly staff!  'Right Pricing'..give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great combo of southern food and sports bar, recommend the BBQ chicken, corn, and mashed potatoes platter!"}
{"text":"No complaint about food and drink, it's just ok. The complaint I have , is that I was over charged on my credit card. I received my bill, left a gratuity in cash (30%), and was charged an extra 10$ on my card. Called twice about it with no return phone call. Check your cards, it happened at outside bar."}
{"text":"So far, I've been unhappy. I don't want to see the calories of everything on the menu.  It makes you never want to eat out again.  Secondly, the waitress took my drink order and 15 minutes later I had to go hunt someone to tell them she never came back.  About the same time she came out with my drink telling me she almost passed out.  Yes, I'm really happy to take my drink from someone that may be sick.  She assured me it was because she hadn't eaten before coming to work and she had been running around.   I'm not feeling good about this place so far.   It's a great addition to this area but someone needs to be watching out for the customers.   8 women with a little boy sitting close by and no one is bring their food out and they've been here before me. after waiting over 30 minutes, I got my chicken taco and the chicken looked like dark meat which was very surprising.    I asked and was told that it was. That's all it took for me to walk out.  Ugh!!' I'll try it again when I have plenty of time to waste."}
{"text":"If I could rate them 0 stars I would. The wife and I are in town enjoying a relaxing kid free weekend and decided to stop in for dinner. Service was horrible. Took 30 minutes to get our appetizer(got the chicken nachos which weren't that good). Waited another 30 minutes for our entree. Brought my burger out that looked like it had sat under the heat lamp forever. Bun was burnt and the burger didn't even have everything on it should. Server and manager could care less although he took care of the nachos and couple of beers I got. Needless to say we won't be coming back or going to the ones they are planning on opening in SC."}
{"text":"We had to ask for our waters two times from our waiter. Still didn't get them so my girlfriend went up to the bartender and asked and gave my gf a dirty look like she was too good to get a fucking water. Note we in here on a Saturday afternoon and its slow as shit. So if you see a fat blonde girl bartending give her the middle finger"}
{"text":"I was so hoping this would be our late night spot.  But no.  Service sucks!!  The waitresses intentionally did not give eye contact because they knew we wanted our food.  We had to wait nearly an hour for our vegetarian food - salad, rice, veggie burger.  You would think we ordered an animal that had to reach a certain internal temperature.  Geesh! This place has potential...but looking at the comments - Service will be its downfall.  I was rooting for you CAH.  But you didn't even TRY to win us, or better, do good by yourself.  You didn't even try!!!  No heart or soul - just big and empty - empty of genuine customer service."}
{"text":"Just meh....!! Clearly this is a place to explore if you love trying different beer b/c they have so many I can't count but I'm not a big beer drinker so for those that are I would say yes go here. They also have a TV for every possible viewing angle so if you like sports this is a great place to watch.  Our service/server was great....the food not so much!! We ordered wing zingers can you say yuck they were chewy like rubber we switched to just the boneless wings which are basically tenders cut in half & tossed in sauce(much better)! I ordered sliders...not good.... the bun is too thick and there is not enough burger for that plus my bun was cold & the cheese wasn't melted. Their fries are not my thing because I'm not a fan of beer battered fries....no thanks. My kids & hubby said their food was good but hubby did mention things were a bit too salty. So not a good food experience and sadly I won't be returning but kudos to a good staff and Kids night Tuesday where they eat for $.99! (which is why they got 2 stars instead of 1)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Any beer you can imagine is on tap including local brews. You can't beat the location right next to the Epicentre. All the food is great, but do yourself a favor and get the cheese curds. I think they make them in house too. They are our go to every time we come. They also have a lot of giveaways and things going on during big games and sporting events."}
{"text":"We tried CAH on the recommendation of a friend.  They must have come on a good day.  We ordered the fried cheese curds that our waitress recommended for an appetizer ($8) and all 12-13 of the curds that came in our order were good.  But waaaaayy too few for the price.  Most of what was the plate were fryer crumbs.  And the sweet pepper dipping sauce was weird, so we ate the few we got plain.  Also got the nachos but didnt want any of the three meat options.  So for $9.49 we got a pile of mostly dry chips with what looked and tasted like pump cheese and a nearly full head of iceberg lettuce on top.  Really?  Since I'm paying almost $10 and am opting out of the most expensive ingredient, how about jazzing up the rest of what is on the plate?  Or offering to sub another ingredient?  And the chips were cold on top of that.  Our bill for what little low-quality food we got and two beers came to $49.50 before tip.  What a rip off."}
{"text":"Tremendous selection of beers at reasonable prices. We had pizza and wings. The pizza was good. A razor-thin crispy crust with a generous amount of toppings. We tried both the buffalo-style and dry rub wings. The buffalo wings were very standard bordering on sub-standard with the sauce being too vinegary with little heat. The dry-rub wings were fantastic. Grilled rather than fried with a smoky flavor. We ended up coming back later in the evening just to order another dozen. The service and attitude were for the most part terrible. Our server for the first visit was very slow and imattentive. I ended up asking a passing server for a plate and silverware. Our second visit was a study in bad service. We were told there was a 25 minute wait despite there being at least a dozen empty tables. We decided to wait in the crowded bar area and any time we sat at an empty table just to get out of the way we were immediately chastised by either a server or the hostess. Explaining that we were not trying to steal the table but rather just trying clear the aisles fell on deaf and rude ears. The ironic part was when we finally were seated we didnt see a server for TWENTY minutes. We had to go complain to the same rude hostess before we got any service. Not worth the hassle for me. I wont be back."}
{"text":"My sister and I are pretty great guest at restaurants.  We tip very well because we want everyone to have a living wage and feel that waiting is hard labor.

We went to Carolina Ale House, sat down and waited...waited...and waited.  A young woman took our order but seemed annoyed at us for asking for food.  She didn't want to write it down and attempted to remember our order.  i figured it may have been a bad night but she was very attentive to other guest.

The appetizer was way too salty to eat so we sat it to the side.  No need to complain because we had meals coming and honestly we shouldn't have been eating so late at night.

We received the meals and a side was missing.  Another woman brought it to us and she was extremely pleasant.  We said thank you and she actually responded with your welcome.  Security was also pleasant.

Unfortunately our meals were too salty to eat also so we bagged them to go but i don't know why.  We cant eat them.

Overall:
Pros: TV's close to tables, location, clean bathrooms

Cons:
Uneatable salty food
No refills on sodas
Poor customer service
Parking"}
{"text":"Came for a happy hour drinking spot. Good beer variety and that is the reason for my grade.  Food was ok.  Had the wings and they were breaded and not overly spicy unfortunately."}
{"text":"Fairly standard corporate sports bar. However, there were a few surprising high points to my visit. I got the varsity cheeseburger, which was actually cooked to my specifications, had a really decent char grilled flavor and was overall a good meal. I'm so used to requesting a burger cooked anywhere from medium well to medium and it coming out like a thick slice of charred cardboard when ordering at a chain. The service was good too, with the exception of the space cadet hostess who exuded this attitude as if she were too good to be there. Also, they have pretty good beer specials."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks, food, and to watch a game. Great selection of beers, however service was unacceptable. We waited much longer than the wait time the hostess suggested. The food was terrible. It came out cold and not as described on the menu. When it came to leave our server had to go back 4 times because she couldn't get the check right. Will not be back or recommend this to anyone unless you just want to drink beer at the bar."}
{"text":"One name sums up my review..... Belinda. I have never given a bad review but I have never seen a server as rude as her.  She was bothered to do her job,(serving us) and let us know verbally. Hope you enjoy the unearned tip we still gave to you Belinda. Because they won't pay tips when you get fired and end up working at dollar general."}
{"text":"We had a group of 4 go on Saturday night at 6:45.  The wait was 15 minute for the dining room but there were open seats at the bar so we decided to sit there.  There were 3 or 4 people working behind the bar.  After sitting there for 10 minuets without anyone helping us we finally got the attention of one of the girls and she was very rude.  After another 30 minuets we got the attention of someone else who finally took our food order.  Our friends food came out and they finished, my husband and I still had not gotten our meals so I had to get someone's attention once again.  she looked in the computer, They had our order wrong and it was put in as a to go order she said.  I told her I ordered southwest chicken and she comes back to tell me that \"they\" said we don't have that on the menu.  I had to show her it was in fact on the menu.  Not one person behind the bar asked us if we were good, if we needed anything, they wouldn't even look at us when they walked by.   They seemed to be bothered by us sitting there.  
by this point we were ready to leave but still waiting to get our tab, we had already stood up, put on our jackets and we were standing behind our chairs. Finally I got someone's attention and asked for the tab.  Very bad experience all the way around,  food was just ok and service was terrible!  Will not go back."}
{"text":"The lady tonight at the bar super nice and really sexy but nice. Now the bartender Mike was a douche. He never payed attention to us and kept talking to 3 losers in a corner while that lady busted her ass doing everything. There were even 6 hot chicks out drinking and he ignored them also. Maybe he is a cuckhold and that's it's thing. Anyway thank you Miss for a wonderful evening and Mike well you suck."}
{"text":"My wife likes football but does not understand it.  I understand it but do not care for it. We were looking for a place we could walk in during the Saturday afternoon games and be seated immediately with various table options, and Carolina Ale House did not disappoint. Nobody spoke to us when we walked in, so we were able to pick our own table.  There were so many options!  Nearly every table was available.  Carol wanted to sit at one of the high tables, but remembering how difficult it was to get her up in a high chair at Applebee's last week, I talked her into a standard-height table by the window.  

It took 10-15 minutes for any of the hostesses or waitresses to notice us.  This was ideal, as it gave us ample of time to take in our surroundings. Plus, nothing is worse than an overly attentive restaurant staff.  We have only been in Charlotte for a year or so, and have been looking for places the locals go.  I think its safe to say we've found it! The 3 people sitting at the bar looked like they had been coming for years, as did the homeless man stumbling around outside the window.  

Our waitress finally came over with menus, and we started to look through the beer list.  My wife is generally picky when it comes to beer, so she ordered a bud light.  I am really getting into the craft beer scene, so I asked for a Yuengling draft.  The waitress returned 15 minutes later with the bud light, and informed me that the Yuengling keg was empty.  Plan B was a Rolling Rock, which was delivered swiftly at room temperature.  Despite the 2:1 waitress/patron ratio, our server had no sense of urgency.  Although we had time to thoroughly read through the menu, we looked no further than the appetizers. Carol went with the Bacon Cheese Fries and I asked for the Five-Cheese Spinach Dip with the spinach on the side. After delivering our order to the kitchen our waitress stepped out for a cigarette and then  stopped by to check in on us, at which point we ordered another round of beers.  

We couldn't see any of the TVs from where we were sitting, but we knew where they were and looked forward to catching a glimpse on our way out.  Our food came out 5 minutes later and was cold.  It seemed like the food was prepared and served the night before, returned, refrigerated and re-heated, or was never cooked in the first place. I hoped it was the former, but either explanation would be fine with me.  I hate to see good food go to waste, but I would also feel bad if they fired up the oven just because we were there.  We had a great experience at Carolina Ale House, and look forward to dining there again."}
{"text":"Solid downtown sports bar.  I have stopped by a couple times on Saturday night around 10:00pm after catching something at the performing arts center but wanting to grab a small meal and see the end of some of the evening college football games.  It's a nice place to watch a game, and they have always had tables available when I have arrived. It's not nearly as crazy as the next door epicenter if you are not up for the epicenter craziness on the weekend.  They have large list of draft craft beers about 50.  They run out of a few on the weekend (I think they have limited storage space for the mini kegs) but worst case is you have 35 to choose from

I have gone with simple foods like sliders, quesadilla(s), or soft tacos, but everything has been good that I have tried.  I have had good service.  They have a circular bar in the  middle with tables around the outside. So, I think it is a hard place to wait tables because you cannot see all your tables at once.

Solid Choice.  They do offer parking validation in the Charlotte Plaza parking deck in the evening. They are on the front side of the CP office building."}
{"text":"First time, sat at outside bar on a nice day. Beautiful view of the lake. Food was good but not exactly what we ordered. I ordered chicken tacos - good and rice was really tasty. My companion ordered the Carolina 'cue combo platter but received the Carolina 'cue sandwich. The bartender was rather lackadaisical & either was having a bad day or just didn't care. He messed up other orders or just forgot the order while we were there. I'm hoping it was just a bad day. Place was great otherwise."}
{"text":"Our experience here was great thanks to Kiara! We sat at the bar and she was an excellent server! She was sweet & professional and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were amazing!  I'll admit I haven't had any in years but these were delicious.  The mango salsa was really fresh tasting and the fish was crisp on outside and fell apart in your mouth.  Oh yeah, wait staff is gorgeous as well at least when I was there for lunch."}
{"text":"Food was average bar food and the atmosphere was nice. It was a warm night the group elected to sit outside on the patio which was pretty nice. Service was not up to par however. Drinks sat empty for along time and were never brought silverware until we stopped another server to ask for it. Nice downtown location but the parking is virtually none! Perhaps they should consider validating parking at the epicencter or nearby which may draw more business."}
{"text":"Typical bar-type food, good beers on draft, lots of TVs......good place to watch a game.  I highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, or the Blackened Tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"We have been eating at the Carolina Ale House on a regular basis.  We both love the fried chicken salad.  Service can be fair to good at times.  Rarely have we had a great server."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I had ribs and the French onion soup. My buddy who's a Packer fan (we feel sorry for him) had the brisket sandwich. Good place to watch sports since there's like a zillion tv's"}
{"text":"One star because of course you can't give zero. I was here on Sunday night (staying at Marriott for business)...food for takeout was greatly undercooked. Came back tonight and waited nearly 40 minutes for a hamburger and fries order. After complaining I was made to seem it was my fault...manager said \"we don't need people like you\". Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Last time I ever go there. Food was terrible, took over 20 minutes after I finished my drink to get the next, and I was at the bar!!! Service was even worse, there's at least 3 places within the close proximity that are cheaper and better."}
{"text":"Waiters/Waitresses are slow and rude. Waited for someone to ask us if we wanted drinks for about 20 mins and then one waiter just walked around holding his hands like he didn't have anything to do. Then when they did finally come to get our order, they acted impatient like I was the waiter and not the customer. First impressions are everything. I will not be coming to this Carolina Ale House ever again."}
{"text":"We were sat and waited 15 minutes without a server coming to our table. Asked a waitress who passed our table and she said she would find out who could help us. Waited another 5 minutes no server or manager helped us. 20 minutes without even an acknowledgement was enough. We walked out."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! Waitress wouldn't refill drinks and we were having to yell to get her attention. Orders were wrong - she brought my husband's steak without any sides and said they were out. She should've asked about a substitution before serving his food but didn't matter because a well done steak was medium rare! My ribs were cold and sent back only to be cold again and no sides when brought out! The manager wouldn't even come speak to us - no apologies. My husband and I left without eating. It was such a horrible experience it was almost comical."}
{"text":"Horrible service on 1/1/18 at 3:30. My group of people had to wait 40 mins before the bartender would even close out our tabs. We would have gotten another beer but she was too busy talking to the cooks in the back of the kitchen the entire time. The other people had sit down at the bar and were not even helped. They ended up leaving after sitting there for 20 mins. Overall hire new people that actually do their jobs."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but don't come here on a big sports weekend.  In town for NCAA Tourney and went here to eat and watch games.  For over an hour could not get anyone to,change one TV out of 10 so we could see the game we were interested in.  It was in one TV across bar that we had to stand up to see, then with 40 seconds left and a tie game they change the channel.  Manager said he had too many requests.  It is the NCAA tourney, know the schedule and plan on when to have games on."}
{"text":"Food very average.  Service very average.  Beer and Beer selection EXCELLENT.  This place could be GREAT if the people that worked there were nicer and maybe smiled a little."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Carolina Ale House, a sports bar and grill that boasts over 50 TV's located in the busy Concord Mills Mall area. This family friendly place has an extensive menu featuring wings, burgers, tacos, pizza and much more.

Dora here. When we first moved to this area, we were disappointed at the lack of sports pubs. That changed when Carolina Ale House came on scene, and we especially like that they offer tables and booths separate from the bar area, which makes it great for families.

For our appetizer, we chose the Beer-battered Cheese Curds served with a red pepper jalapeno jam dipping sauce. These curds were great with a soft smooth center and a light batter on the outside and when combined with the slightly sweet dipping sauce, just kept me coming back for more. Next time I would ask them to be a little crispier, the way I really like them. Dora here. The curds could've used an extra minute both in the fryer and the drying basket, since they were just a tad greasy. But that didn't stop us from eating every last one of these little nuggets. Yum! And the sauce was a great dipper, tangy with a tinge of sweet.

For my meal, I chose the Crispy Ribs with onion strings. These ribs were slow-cooked, dropped into the fryer to crisp up the outside, and then tossed in a BBQ sauce. The ribs were great, fall off the bone tender and the crispiness added a completely different texture. Just a warning, that Thai chili dipping sauce was HOT, so try a little before dipping the entire rib into it.

Dora here. Hot? I think I heard Ernie's taste buds sizzling. haha. The Chicken Dunkers are a promo that I hope end up on the regular menu. Coated in a beer batter, these plump little cluckers were crispy and golden and delicious! The pepper ranch dipping sauce soothed after the kick from the mango habanero, so I appreciated both. A bite of heat, a bite of cool. lol. Quite a generous sized portion for less than $8, don't you think? So, maybe fried chicken and fried cheese wasn't the healthiest of lunches, but I did gnaw on those carrots, too. I'd order this same combo again.

What about you? What unhealthy choices do you splurge on? Stop over at Fiction Faith & Foodies; we'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers http://bit.ly/2kDSvAg"}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional about the Alehouse.The beer selection is good but they were out of two of the beers I ordered. The food was average at best. The service was terrible. Our waiter was slow and seemed not to care if we had drinks or if we needed anything to go with our food. It might be a fun place to watch a game at the bar but not really a place to bring the family to eat."}
{"text":"I came in two days in a row that's how great our service was! Clyde was absolutely fantastic, not only is he personable and polite but attentive and a complete gentleman. I Would definitely recommend this ale house and make sure you ask for Clyde... he's the don dotta!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and some beer. The Carolina nachos were great. The beer was also really good. However, things went downhill after that. My wife's grilled shrimp tacos came out ice cold. In fact, it looked like they took thawed shrimp and just put them in the tortilla. I ordered zingers which are usually a very safe choice.  Alas not today. They also came out cold. We notified our server and she put in a reorder of both. After over 20 minutes the reordered food still had not come out. We eventually just paid the bill and left. If you want beer and snacks, this is a good place. For dinner, you are taking a chance. Hope your experience is better than ours..."}
{"text":"Salty. I shoulda known better than to eat at a place that looks like Hooters (minus the hooters).

Brisket sandwich. Brisket was tender but VERY salty. I definitely did not need the au jus on the side. 

Service was sloooow, as with most places in NC. 

I asked for a salad instead of fries (trying to watch that girlish figure ya know?) and it was a very very sad iceberg lettuce salad with a wedge of tomato and two pieces of red onion. 

Side note: This looks like a popular locals spot for beer & wings. Come with low expectations."}
{"text":"This place is great. Solid 3.5 stars. Rounded it up to 4 due to this being newly opened and giving them the benefit of working out the kinks.

The beer selection is awesime. 60 brews on tap with many of them being local faves. The outside bar lacks a few of them so one would need to order inside and close out the tab, which is a little inconvenient. 

All apps are under $10, which is a plus in my book. We tried their chcken and rib combo with coleslaw and beans. The chicken and coleslaw were standard but the ribs and beans were exceptionally tasty!

They have an awesome view of the water, tv's galore,  and great atmosphere. Prices are decent and happy hour is Monday thru Friday 4p to 6p, $1 off brews.  Cassie rocks! She can work a crowd and remember what you ordered (even when she did not take it)  AND the name it's under - impressive.  Gonna give them some time to work out the kinks, bartenders to gel and get comfy with crowds, beers and names. Bottom line, with so many businesses literally in walking distance,  the staff will need to know how to work the crowd."}
{"text":"this place is cool and l love it. winding down for beer and relax. why do some people like Blaze w. and Caroline and lyndsay N. give it two star. are you guys iddiot? if the bartender doesnt wan to talk to you maybe because you are weirdo looking . so now you going whine about it online for other people to see what an idiot you are. You use yelp to do your whine like a little boy who want his mommy? why caroline c complain about service? what if they short sTAFF? what if someone sick? instead of being understanding you complain about service? both you and blaze give yelp bad names. someone should post their picture at front door and ban them. if you guys going to be critical about every stupid thing then at least offer a viable solution. No body wan to read you damn opinion. seriously. if you guy were actually in a room together you probably eat each out because nothing is good for you"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. (Please keep the Coco Loco!) My wife loves the giant burger. I like the wings and salad with salmon or chicken. Good for patio relaxed dining or a business lunch. Well done! Great location. Walk around the lake after dinner when the weather is good for a nice view of the new area."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bar bite! My coworkers and I went there for drinks on a Friday evening. The service was great and the food was good. The spinach dip, the wings, and the sweet potato fries were amazing. I will definitely head back there when I get a chance."}
{"text":"Tried their dry rub wings at the Taste of Charlotte this year and it was love at first bite. 

About two weeks later I decide to go back for lunch and once again was completely in love with the wrap I had. I also had a potato chip encrusted banana sundae for dessert which was so big I should have shared. SHOULD. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Generic food, not bad, but nothing to write home about. But what was bad was the service. Our server didn't write things down, and forgot my appetizer. Then when all our food arrived a friend with me mentioned to him that he didn't bring our appetizer. His response was \"Its about to come out\" (This was when all our food was at the table and he was checking if there was anything else we needed). I then said, \"Well I don't want it now I wanted it as an appetizer.\" He then proceeded to say \"All I heard was a burger and bleu cheese chips\". So I got the impression that he was then just lying to my face in order to cover up his mistake of completely forgetting about it, and then even further, placing blame on me that he didn't understand I wanted something from the appetizer menu as an appetizer. It then took probably 20 minutes to get our checks, and my friends had the wrong price on their check for their beer which took another 20 minutes. Even if I didn't live out of state I wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed uptown Charlotte but the wait staff here were terrible. Food was pretty good but would not recommend. There are to many other choices."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Carolina Ale House while in town to see the New England Patriots play the Panthers. Good selection of beers and the bacon cheese burger and fries were done right.  I enjoyed the atmosphere. Though it was a chain, it didn't really have the feel of a chain. The waitress we had was good, she made sure we were taken care of and she had a good sense of humour.

Job well done ale house!"}
{"text":"The beer list here is absolutely outstanding.  The food is just ok, and the atmosphere is very much a generic sports bar.  So it's not worth going out of your way for the experience, but if you're in the neighbourhood and looking for a place to grab a good beer, this will do."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this particular Ale House. We were in town for the Clemson Game. 

DeShaun was our server and he was Fabulous! The food, service, and overall experience was great! Great place to watch football and eat. 

Will definitely recommend. 

Melanie"}
{"text":"I come here a lot but never really order food so today I decided to eat lunch here and what do you now it's true what people say the service is great but the food sucks now I'm not the type to complain but I order the chicken zinggers they where luke warm not hot because if they were I could have smelt them as soon as they hit the bar where I was sitting like any other hot wings I will never eat here again the pony thing here that's good cold it the beer"}
{"text":"Great service and food today! Kaisi was our server, and was very friendly and fast. Had Fish and Chips while my friend had a nacho burger.  Will definitely be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Horrible!  Horrible!  Did I mention horrible?? My mom chose this restaurant for her birthday. Big mistake!  Cold food. Sent it back. Came back cold. The other meal ordered came out soggy and cold too!  Manager attempted to fix the problem, but the damage had been done. A memorable birthday for all the wrong reasons. Will NEVER go back here again."}
{"text":"Waited two hours for two wraps and a salad was given a 10$ discount on a 60$ tab while our buddy who was separate from our tab received the same on a 20$ tab. Long wait mediocre food. Terrible service. Do. Not. Go."}
{"text":"I always enjoy dining outside when the weather permits especially uptown. If there is anything going on that isnt game day related or your not uptown during the lunch rush I strongly suggest it. The location is convenient to some reasonable parking. It is also walkable to various things to do uptown and also public transportation.

Can get crowded around game time or any other events but wait and service is never too shabby. Staff is pretty relaxed and knowledgeable. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because sometimes they can be a little too relaxed.

I will always recommend the wings and bbq stuff. I'm a slaw and beans kinda gal and thats my favorite pair here. Great bar service with good quality drinks.

Prices are good for the amount and quality of food you get. I always recommend."}
{"text":"The Good:  This place has a  great draft beer selection including several Carolina locals. 
The Bad: They don't offer beer flights so you can sample several new beers (come on, it's Carolina Ale House, and what better way to promote Carolina beers than with a flight)
The Ugly:  The food isn't very good at this place. Just regular bar fare, and nothing special."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!!  Crooked.  Advertised special clearly displayed, but not actual price.  Special says $3.15 and was charged $3.75 per drink.  Manager said, \"There is nothing I can do.  I can't change the price just for you.\""}
{"text":"Everything about this visit was slow.  Slow to get drinks. Slow to get the food.  Took over an hour to get wings and salads.  Don't bother unless you have a lot of time to waste."}
{"text":"I went to the new location of Carolina Ale House near Concord Mills for dinner tonight. The food was really tasty and a good value. The hamburgers are freshly made, and you can really taste the difference compared to some of the other chains' frozen patties. The fries were really crispy and not greasy. There were literally tvs in every direction, and I cannot wait until the fall to head there for college basketball games. The service was fast and friendly. I have been to other Ale House locations in the triangle area, and this one is by far the nicest. They also have a patio for outdoor seating. I noticed that draft beers are $3 on Wednesday nights. The craft beer list is extensive, featuring many local NC breweries and great detailed information on the individual beer selections. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Venue: Carolina Ale House

Decor:   It's a Sports bar, what' 'cha think

Service:   Spotty (especially at the front in getting a table)

Environment:  pretty active, not too loud, good crowd

Food:   Pretty good.  That sampler was on Point.  Lot of menu options, huge plus

Prices:   Fair, more than reasonable

Huge Pros:  The prices, location, good beer selection

Debbie Downers:  Needs more space for larger groups
 
Conclusion:   I am a fan! Good food. They are the self-proclaimed best wings in Charlotte.  I don't know if they are the best but are pretty damn good!  Food was good.  Waitress was pretty good.

Overall: It is located in the middle of Uptown Charlotte, heart of the city.  Very good food.  Good amount of up to date televisions.  This is a sports bar that I am in favor of.  If you are from out of town, this is a nice spot to kick it and watch the games.

Grade:  B"}
{"text":"Typical bar atmosphere. Great bar! Indoor and out. Outstanding service and friendliness. The food is about average though definitely wouldn't be my first pick food wise but it is convenient how late it stays open though. It's hard to find restaurants that stay open past 9 or 10 o'clock ."}
{"text":"The food was not prepared right. They messed up are orders more than once . And the manager didn't introduce herself and wasn't willing to comp are food for the inconvenience. I will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"Came pretty late at night and had a burger which was pretty good but the waitress changed the tip amount by a lot. I noticed when I checked my statement few days later. 

This place is right near my work and was planning on going there with my coworkers but I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Surprised by the mid to low stars, this place is a great spot to hang out for a beer and watch sports or chill with friends on the patio.  

Visiting family from LA, I found this to be the go to spot for our nightcap. Local establishment offering decent burgers, good music, friendly service and nice selection of beers on tap.  I guess people here must have caviar taste on tuna fish budget!  I'll admit we went during the week and not weekend, so perhaps my review is partial."}
{"text":"Food was very good and they have a very extensive beer selection. Had the Buffalo Blue burger and the French Onion soup which were excellent. Service was good for it being late at night and I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great location, plenty of screens to watch football, and the dry rub wings were delicious...no really I'm ready to fly back to have some more. Their green bean side, fried shrimp and apple blossom were good too, but those WINGS!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Carolina Ale House twice.  Once with coworkers and once with my husband.  Both times we have sat outside.  They have a great patio area, but both times we were swarmed and bothered by multiple bees.  I understand they like the sugar in the beer and drinks, but I've been to outdoor patio places and have not seen an issue with this.

Also, the second time I came here with my husband and dog.  The manager came over to us and said dogs were not allowed, but would allow us to stay that time.  I appreciate that, but CAH needs to think about allowing dogs on such a nice patio area, especially when places like Panera and soon arriving Smashburger allow it.  I will amend my review and come back to CAH when they allow dogs.

Food:  It's alright, nothing outstanding.  I order the buffalo wrap and Kevin got the fish tacos.  My wrap tasted like a good chicken wrap, but there was no buffalo flavor.  I had to ask for the sauce on the side after since I think they forgot to add it to the wrap.  The waiter says it is usually over powering on it.  Not in this case.  

Overall, I think this place has potential on the location and the nice outdoor area, but they need to fix things.  Spray for bees, have a patio area to welcome dogs to sit, and work on the food being correct."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal on a special day (wife's birthday). Coty was a great server. Wonderful atmosphere. Aways love coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"I came here tonight after walking out of the hotel restaurant where I'm staying due to bad service. I was in a stank mood. It was well lit and people were dining outside. This made my decision because everything in Charlotte seems to close early on Sunday. 

The service here was great. The hostess was friendly and sat us quickly. Our waitress was Brenda. I couldn't have gotten a better waitress tonight she matched our speed perfectly. She was efficient, personable, knowledgeable and friendly. We ordered steak and cheese and roasted garlic Parmesan wings. I'm normally not a fan of roasted/ baked chicken wings due to the texture. These had the same texture I hate but the seasoning is so good. I put them in the oven for more cooking when I got to a friends house and yummmm!! So glad I ordered something outside of my norm with a little help from Brenda. She also suggested a sangria which I loved. My sister loved her steak and cheese combo, especially the steak fries. 
The price is extremely reasonable. I left much happier than when I came in. At least 2 other waitresses said friendly hellos when passing and another waitress wiping off the table next to me even asked me if we needed anything. I suggest trying this place if you have not. If I'm ever in this area again I would definitely return no hesitation."}
{"text":"This bar is less than one star. The food was great. But they had nothing but excuses, I ordered chicken tenders and 35 minutes later the bartender told me their chef walked out so the manager was cooking. Well for future reference that's not my problem. Not the bartenders fault if this was true but don't make excuses if you're going to tell me 40 minutes later when I ordered chicken tenders. I just moved to Charlotte and certainly won't be returning here. The food is good and the beer is cold but don't expect anything quickly."}
{"text":"I come here often because I live close by and you have titos vodka. Elyse is by far my favorite bartender! Always love coming when she is working!

The French onion soup is my favorite and I also love the option of grilled wings instead of fried."}
{"text":"Terrible Experience. Went here to meet up with friends. The hostess told us it would be a half an hour wait. We were fine with waiting and decided to grab a couple drinks at the bar

None of the bartenders came over to check if we needed anything despite being called several times. A waitress came over to ask us if we needed anything told her what we wanted and she went to tell a bartender. Said bartender listened to her telling what we wanted and then went back to doing other work completely ignoring us and our drinks.

Finally, an hour later even though we were told originally was going to be half an hour wait, they came back to us saying it would be another hour for our table.

They didn't offer any discounts for waiting, any comped appetizer, drinks, nothing. They didn't even try to ask other patrons that had been sitting there to leave for other patrons that have been waiting for a table

Without a doubt, worst dining experience I've had"}
{"text":"We stopped for the first time in mid January 2015.  Our service was very slow.  I ordered wings.  They came out stone cold.  I sent them back to be reheated.  The restaurant didn't reheat, but replaced with piping hot ones.  They then charged me for both orders, almost until I caught it.  It then took 10 more minutes to clean up the bill before we were finally able to leave.  Overall unimpressive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to this location about every two-three weeks. Out of all the other Ale house locations this one is definitely my favorite! Every time we come here we order the same thing (Chicken nachos & Boneless Zinger wings... so good!). The beer selection is always great and lots of local options at this location, which is a major plus for us! The service is always fast & friendly with the exception of the occasional busy game nights, which is understandable! Any time we have family in town or want a place to eat after a special occasion, this is where we go!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice for lunch the last two weeks. Had the island style shrimp tacos and was very pleased. One of the better seafood tacos I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great French onion soup and even better veggie burger. The burger came with onion straws, cheese and spicy ranch, and it was amazing. While the veggie patty is premade (morningstar, i think), for me it's all about the toppings. The ranch seems to be house made. 

Despite working next door, I always overlook this place, thinking it will have lackluster bar food. But I will return, if only for these two items."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night following a drum corps show.  First of all, it was late, it was Sunday, and I was in a group of nine.  Knowing that, it kind of makes up for the service struggles.  Nevertheless, the orders were mixed up and sometimes we felt forgotten.  Those problems might have been specific to that night, though, so I wouldn't make a big deal about it.

The food was pretty typical bar food.  I had wings, that were advertised as hot, but not really too spicy.  Prices were very fair.

The biggest pro was the huge beer selection.  If you are a beer drinker, they had a ton.  That night all \"Carolina\" beers were $2, a great special for a bar in the heart of a major city."}
{"text":"I realize the location - smack dab in the middle of uptown - makes it unlikely to impress.  It seems most of the bars catering to the jock crowd in Charlotte's uptown are unimpressive. 

It starts out promisingly -- it's two floors, and I guess was another restaurant until recently.  We came for football Sunday and got there early so we could pick a good table with multiple TVs in sight. The shine from the sun outside made the downstairs difficult to watch the TVs, so we headed upstairs.

The food was fairly substandard. Nachos, chicken wrap and hamburger all very basic and blah. Ok beer selection. Just nothing to write home about.

We won't be back. There are simply too many great places to go to watch football to waste time on a joint like this. I wish them well - I'm sure it caters to some people perfectly."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see this place open. We are really close and thought that we would have somewhere to eat and catch a brew without entering the traffic jam at Concord Mills.

The food here is hit or miss depending on what you order. The items I have tried so far; BBQ pork ribs (tender and meaty, but the dry rub made them taste burnt, the sauce was good), Baked beans (dried out and cold), and the Salmon (delicious), the Ruben (thought it was good not great), fish and chips (don't order this unless you like more breading than fish, I pulled my breading off), the Tilapia special (honestly I wouldn't have served it, about the size of an iPhone), the wings are terrible too, deep fried with lots of breading, but the sauce was pretty good.

When I first visited the server was attentive and constantly checked on us to make sure things went well. The last two times (dinner)... took an extremely long time to great us. The food service was horrible, it took over 30 minutes to get anything to eat and our drinks were not refilled or even checked on, even the beer. The salads came with the meal, the balsamic dressing was the consistency of pudding. The food was cold but after the long wait we just ate it. The server never returned to ask if everything was alright and the manager spent the whole time talking with friends at a table right beside us. We noticed a lot fewer cars in the parking lot than usual and it was within 45 minutes of a football game on Sunday evening, curious. We both commented on it and said what a shame if they go out of business.

I agree with the other comments about the loud music playing over the speakers  throughout the restaurant. We could not hear any of the football games or baseball playoffs. This is a sports bar right??? They need to change that ASAP! Temperature was \"north pole\" cold and it was a nice 75 outside. 

What's good about this place, and why do we keep going back? First, it's close to us and there are TV's EVERYWHERE in the restaurant, so no matter what angle you are sitting at, a TV will be in your line of sight. All sporting events were playing the night we went and we loved it! This is a great place to come to watch any game you want and to have drinks. There is a huge selection of beer and it is cold and the mixed drinks are great too. I am a beer drinker, and this is just what we needed near Concord Mills. Two points for TV and beer."}
{"text":"Bar food hangout with lots of sports! My husband and I ended up here because we wanted something simple for dinner. He liked the beer options and had wings. I'm not into wings, so I tried the shrimp tacos and liked the flavors, sort of chipotle sauce and cabbage. I went for the 3 taco deal because they are small. However the flavors were good for bar food and come with chips and salsa. The service is great and we came on a busy Friday and still had a table within 24 minutes. Park in the deck and walk to avoid the busy street parking in Waverly."}
{"text":"Wings are very overcooked, overbattered with sauce squeezed on top.  Terrible wings! Warning, it is super loud on weekend nights whereas acoustics do not allow for a  conversation.... still good beers, but 6.00 a pop, with no specials and refills are slow to come.   The ahi tuna sandwich was over cooked, that should not happen when you ask for rare.  Hope they figure it out, I loved them last month and cheese curds remain our reason for returning.  Great location."}
{"text":"I went by there to watch a Panthers game and the whole experience was pretty sub-par. For one, the area we were seated in was right below some speakers and they had the cranked up to 11 and we just about had to yell constantly to have conversation. It was kinda interesting in a way because after a while people just kinda subconsciously gave up on conversation and by the end of the evening a few of us were just sitting there quietly. Anyways, along with our drinks we ordered a pretty good assortment of \"bar\" type food. Sandwiches, wings, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, french fries, nachos and even pizza. I sampled a little bit of everything just about since we were all doing a communal snacking type deal and I think the only thing that was even borderline decent was the mini chicken tenders. The nachos had some kind of cheese whiz type sauce which tasted like it was from a jar. I think they brought us 6 or so mozzarella sticks and at least two of them didn't even have any cheese in them. The fried pickles were the soggiest incarnation I've ever tasted and the both the pizza and chicken sandwich were greasy. Overall it was just a crummy meal. They do seem to have a very good drink selection though and a full bar even though the drinks are a little overpriced. If I could say one good thing about the place it is that the wait staff seemed very friendly and was on top of their game. Our server didn't mess anything up and kept all our drinks filled. Another funny note was that the guys running the food to the tables seemed to be clueless as can be. Not only did we get our food but they tried at least 3 additional times to bring us other peoples orders. It's like they had no idea where they were supposed to take the orders."}
{"text":"Great menu and good food but the last 2 times we tried to have a meal we waited for 20-30 minutes prior to getting a table. Once seated we waited close to 20 minutes before a server showed up. Last time we just gave up and went to Chuy's.

Lots of servers standing around chatting with each. Frustrating. Too bad as the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"They just can't figure it out. So many of the same complaints all the same. 3 ladies told the manager their order took 1 hour to get and was cold. He offered a go box. They left their food, paid their bill and left. Others at the bar said they waited 45 minutes for a chicken sandwich which was cold, the list goes on and on. We are done with the Waverly"}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday celebration, 15 people and we sat upstairs. The waitress was very nice and worked very hard...but she also had another table of at least 20 or more people.  I'm not sure why more servers weren't working upstairs but this made our experience terrible due to service.  The dry rub wings are fantastic, as was the veggie pizza."}
{"text":"I will never come to this location again. A few months back, I came here to meet up with my boyfriend to get some wings and beer. It was late during the weekday, so figured we would get seating quick. Ten minutes passed by and none of the hosts/hostesses came by to greet us and find a table. I was frustrated and left. Had to get my grub on at CookOut down the road."}
{"text":"We went on the Saturday after the grand opening. It was very busy and we had about a 20 minute wait. The staff was great at acknowledging us and made sure that we weren't forgotten. The food was pretty standard pub fare and we had no complaints. The service was excellent. Our server, Allie, was professional and very much aware of our needs despite being very busy. All of the servers were helping each other out (with smiles on their faces). We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have been going to CAH since it opened. Almost always get the fried chicken salad and wings. Started out great. Service has become worse as time goes by. We order our items to go since we live close and often pick up on the way home from work. Once the fried chicken salad came with no chicken. Often the dressing is left out. Tonight we had an entree left out completely and the wrong salad, again. So back we go, after arguing with the person who took our order. Aparently our fault. With all the times we have had issues, the manager has never spoke to us and we are made to feel an imposition. Guess it's time count this place a loss. So dissapointing."}
{"text":"Great fast service even with a full house. Good and drinks were great. Honey buffalo wings, fried shrimp taco, pink lemonade & mixed very tea. Everything was absolutely great. Very friendly!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night place was very busy, having a sports bar atmosphere and all the college basketball games on we were not surprised. We were there mainly to have some drinks, beer menu was pretty good, bar tenders were very friendly and attentive. Friends have eaten there and say thee food is good I will have to go back and taste for myself."}
{"text":"We visited this location after a concert in the down town area. We (the adults) were going to have a drink and get the kids some desert. We seated ourselves like the sign said at the hostess podium. We waited a few minutes for a server and finally one came and brought us some water. We went ahead and ordered two deserts off of the menu, which only had three to pick from. Our waitress then disappeared for about 15-20 minutes. We finally got the attention of someone in the food prep area and asked him if he could check on our order. We told him we only had desert and it shouldn't have taken so long. He asked us which ones that we ordered. We told him what we had ordered, and he replied that \"they were out of the two that we ordered\". We asked him if we could get the other item on the desert menu and he said \"we are out of that too\". We politely asked to speak to someone about this and he said \"you are talking to me\". We decided it would be best to leave.  I have been to this Restaurant in other cities and have never had this poor of service."}
{"text":"I guess I will start with saying the service was so bad that we were laughing the whole time about what was going to happen next or how bad the server was. I don't even know if there was a manager working. 

First round of drinks took 25 min to get. After an hour of a friend ordering chips and salsa the waiter comes back and said they were out of salsa. He also ordered a a salad and then came back 30 min later and said the lettuce wilted away. I even had to go to the bar and order drinks because she was hard to find. Another time when I ordered a drink it was sitting at the bar for a long time so I just went and grabbed it myself. I also had tried ordering a steak and she said they had been out. 2 min later another waiter passed us with an order of steaks. I went to ask her and she said \"nope there are no steaks\" as she was trying to stand in the way from me seeing an order of steaks behind her. After finally getting some food 2 hours later I asked 4 times for horse radish. She finally brought it when I was almost done with my food. 

After all of this we still gave her a nice tip. Reflecting back on it we should have left a penny for the small effort she gave. 

Also where was the manager in this establishment. If anything new management needs to be put in place. They should have been circulating to see how everything was going."}
{"text":"It was fine. Not real great. I got the wings which had very little flavor to them. Big though, so that was a positive, but they didn't taste great, which is more important. 

Twin Peaks nearby has significantly better wings. The smoked and grilled wings over there are terrific. 

So yeah, it's fine. But I wouldn't come back prolly."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is but they have the best chicken tenders I've ever had. They're amazing! Their honey mustard truly tops it off. Great beer selection! Good atmosphere, good service. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy coming here for the food. However, the service can be very hit or miss. Sometimes it is great and other times it is very slow. They also have a lot of TVs and can be a great place to watch the game."}
{"text":"I love wings and try them everywhere. The grilled buffalo wings best ever. Hailey wonderful bartender."}
{"text":"On one of the ice/snow days this winter, this place was one of the few places open.  They only had a limited menu consisting of mostly fried foods, which we weren't into.  So, I can not comment on the food.

Carolina Ale House has a great beer menu as well.  But, for some reason they didn't actually have a lot of the beers.  I just wanted an IPA.  I asked for Bell's 2 hearted, the server came back and said they were out.  Same thing happened when I ordered a Hopsecutioner.  I finally just asked him, what do you have and it was a good IPA at a reasonable price for downtown Charlotte.

I don't feel I got the true experience because of the inclemate weather, so I'll have to try again."}
{"text":"Got here at 9:30 on a Saturday night. They close at 1 and we are here with a party of 10 waiting to be seated as we see many open tables. They say the wait will be about 15 minutes. Why? Because none of the servers want to take on more tables. A large section of the restaurant is closed?? They are open for more than 3 more hours! Only 1 server in the restaurant section!! The bar area is a little busier, but has closed sections as well, but the restaurant area not so much. Not sure why we need to wait? If my pregnant daughter-in-law from out of town didn't want it so bad, we would leave. Now they say it will be another 20-25 minutes!
Ok. I bumped the stars from 1-3. After complaining, whether the manager or a waitress heard us, we were seated. The waitress agreed to take our table. She could have served us with bad attitude but she was very polite and considerate. She took really good care of us. I wish I had her name, but unfortunately I do not remember it :(
Food wasn't bad. Everyone left full (beyond full) and happy."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Don't go thirsty. If you're at the bar it isn't bad but you're going to wait forever at a table for service."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service, high prices and less than appealing food. If you can't make a hot wing edible then I think you're in the wrong business. Cool atmosphere, maybe they will sell the place to someone who cares about quality along with appearance."}
{"text":"Carolina Ale House is now my new favorite sports bar in Uptown. It's very shiny with a ton of TV's, a HUGE selection of draft beer and an awesome location. Their dining room is decorated with local sports memorabilia and the atmosphere is very chill and definitely sports-like. I've ventured here plenty of times after Bobcats games or as a place to start the night with friends as a jump-off spot. Every server/bartender I have had has been extremely cool, patient and attentive. I actually have not eaten here yet but only because I've always focused on the beer party of the menu. (Duh) They must have a few dozen beers on tap and a cool shot menu that consists of funky bombs and libations to keep you entertained while there. 

If you come on a big game night it WILL be busy so attempt to get there early to grab a table or a seat at the bar. Otherwise, there seems to be enough seats to go around  (They also have an upstairs area which I have yet to explore). 

If you are tired of the typical Uptown sports bars in Charlotte, walk across 4th street from the Epicentre to try Carolina Ale House. They are the new guy in town with a chain-like appearance but with a Charlotte spot feel."}
{"text":"Bbq & buffalo wings was on point as well as the bacon cheese fries! Customer service was great too. Will definitely come back when given a chance."}
{"text":"The server was excellent. Never left the drinks empty and everything came out in a timely manner. I ordered the chili cheese fries and 12 wings honey BBQ style. The sauce was a little over powering and the wings didn't stay warm long. They were cold within five minutes. Same deal for the fries. 

Also, because I used to bartend I am picky about how drinks are made and my Shirley temple was made with the grenadine on the bottom. This made it difficult to mix and a little too sweet. 

We sat outside which was really nice and the TVs were ideal for watching the Carolina v Duke game. I'm guess food is one of their last priorities, but id still come back to watch the games."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 7 during a work lunch Monday and requested a table (not a high top). After around 5 minutes of the servers putting the table together the hostess pointed at the table and said you can sit when you want. 

I ordered the daily special which was Tilapia with rice and veggies. I told the waitress that I didn't need the rice, I wouldn't eat it. She asked me if I would like to substitute for something else, and I asked for the french onion soup. When she brought out our food, instead of soup I had mashed potatoes. She quickly realized the mistake on her own, and went back to get the soup. My coworker also got the tilapia, which we both took 1 bite and knew something was off. Neither of us ate it and my coworker, asked the waitress if she could have a chicken breast. I just ate the soup, and the veggies. 

Several reviews stated that the food isn't that good, and I'm inclined to agree."}
{"text":"The Environment was astounding the food was decent and the service was great, burgers are there main entree and it ended up being pretty good (loved the bun) but my sister ordered the pizza and it was awful way to much oregano and way to much sauce the pizza was really over powering I do not recommend the pizza but the view is amazing, I would recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"What a joke. Food took over a hour and a half to receive , when it finally came out it was the wrong food. Not only that half there beer didn't work and to top it off the female bartenders we're extremely rude! Nothing but attitude, all seem to be miserable and complaining. Dear management hire some new chefs and happy people

{"text":"Carolina Ale House is just your average run of the mill place with very average food. The service has been kind of slow the few times I have gone. Pretty good burgers, which is what I usually get. Nothing to write home about, but not much to complain about besides the slow service. There are just so many options for amazing food in Charlotte that this place doesn't match up."}
{"text":"The food is always vile no matter how many times ive tried.  The only reason i would go here is to get drinks."}
{"text":"This place is just plain aweful. Where to begin?  The server:  impersonal, impatient, and slooow. The food: Luke warm, bland, uninspired. The beer selection: a joke for a place that calls itself an Ale House. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Sub par food, over cooked burger & ribeye.....asked for med rare & got WELL, a crime with decent beef, too bad because the burger seemed like good quality beef.  Kids loved their sliders at least.  French fries are gross (strange fries), onion rings like floppy greasy mush. They fortunately could not screw up my bottled beer! Redeeming quality was the service - really great. They have a ton of beers to choose from, go for the beer & the multiple game displays, not the food!"}
{"text":"It was about and hour and a half before closing and our waitress did everything but her job. She talked with friends that seemed to be waitin on her instead of waiting on us and our needs. We had to ask other servers for things such as silverware smh and refills. It's crazy how people don't wanna make money she could have gotten a nice tip. Definetly won't be returing to this location or the one in Durham."}
{"text":"We were in town for a cheer competition and needed a place close by to eat in between performances. The proximity to the convention center made this our first choice. 

It was NFL Championship Sunday and we hit the place right at the start of the first game. Our party of seven was seated within five minuets. They must have noticed my over active two year old and our clan of cheerleaders so we were seated on the second floor all the way in the back. I thought it was odd since the second floor never even remotely came close to being full, but on retrospect, it fit us well. It allowed the kids not to be strapped to their seats the entire time while not annoying the rest of the guests. 

Service was quick considering the day. Menu seemed to be traditional American fair.   I opted for the grilled chicken melt on a recommendation from the waiter. Drinks came out quick but the food took some time. Luckily the kids were entertained with the billiards table right next to us. 

Once the food arrived I was not impressed. The grilled chicken melt was extremely dry and the size of the chicken filet was a fraction of the bread it came on. My wife had ordered the grilled chicken zingers (boneless wings) however they came out fried.  

Overall the atmosphere and proximity to downtown Charlotte entertainment is what this place has going for it. I would recommend it for drinks and appetizers prior to a Hornets or Panthers game (or during the game - lots of big screen TV's). If you're looking for quality of food, I'm sure there are other choices."}
{"text":"So from the stars and reviews I was expecting a not so great experience but I was pleasantly surprised. We were seated before the timeframe given, so I was happy that my kids weren't getting crazy waiting. Our server came to the table fairly quick and took our drink orders, we ordered the Frickles to start. The Fried Pickles were probably my favorite from all the places around, they give a horseradish sauce that is AMAZING. I literally ate it all then ordered more for my French fries :/ 
We ordered a flight of beer and kids pizza and chicken, beer took a bit longer but kids meals were fast... again, my kids not crying over hunger... perfect!
Kids pizza looked ok my daughter ate almost everything, it comes with fruit.. love that. Kids chicken was good, I tasted that. My favorite part of the kids meal was that it didn't come out steaming hot, it was warm almost hot but perfect for kids to dig right in. 
I ate the chicken gyro, it was missing tzatziki sauce but otherwise was really good. I wanted Greek so bad and it satisfied my Greek fix. My husband got the pub burger and he liked it a lot, the temperature was spot on and it was as big as my head. We loved the beer battered fried and sweet potato fries. 
All in all we had a really nice time, very kid friendly and loud enough where I wasn't having to quiet my kids down. 
The wifi wasn't the greatest, it's free and available but not very strong! Work on the Carolina Ale House!"}
{"text":"We've been back a couple of times since I banned them (don't judge...they have 76 beers on tap!). Service is somethings they seriously need to work on.  If you can get past that they have great food!"}
{"text":"The service is really poor.  We came here to watch a football game.  It took 25 minutes to get our drinks.  The food was pretty bad as well.  We will not be back.  Recommend you don't come here either."}
{"text":"Excited it's here.  Had a very good experience BUT I won't come to watch sport games as NO BACKS ON BARSTOOLS.  Will bring family but heading to. Blackfinn for games.   There are high tops in bar area as an alternative for larger parties and the chairs have backs."}
{"text":"Hostesses were  very friendly.  This is opening week and they are definitely  still working out the kinks. Thankful the initial wait was only 5 minutes,  yet it took over 20 min for burgers and fries. I almost thought they had lost the order. Please note the burgers here are served medium,  which is great for steaks. No bueno for  burgers.  Server made no mention of this and I blame management.  She did offer to send back, but we simply could not wait another 20/30 to correct. I feel cheated for only picking  at half a burger. It was seasoned well, so maybe I will come bk in a month. Plus no manager came by or even asked about the food left on my plate. Oh well, sleek new spot with lots of tvs. Need all hands on deck especially  with weekend lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Solid sports bar. Lots of tv's and friendlier staff than twin peaks. Chicken quasadilla was really good. Slightly better beer prices than similar chains. We will be back on football Saturday's and Sunday's."}
{"text":"Went with a friend to shoot pool, was disappointed to find out that the upstairs where pool is was closed. Will possibly update review after a future visit"}
{"text":"So disappointing. Service was good but food was all mediocre, at best. We had the buffalo wings, which even though grilled, we're so salty I couldn't eat more than 2. We had the nachos, for which they had no salsa. Only pick de gallo. Good, but no salsa? They ran out. I had high hopes because of the extensive beer menu. Stick with the beer and not the food."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. My husband and I have gone to the Charlotte Uptown location which had horrible food and service and was dirty. Based on that we had not gone back in years. However, a new location opened in Fort Mill about 30 minutes south recently so decided to give it a try. Big Mistake! 

When we first got there we at down on the couch with friends to watch football in the outdoor bar area. The coffee table in front of us has dirty plates, napkins, and glassware. After about 10 minutes of waiting for someone to pick it up and wipe down our table, I got tired of looking at it and brought the stuff to the bar where it sat for another 10 minutes before someone cleaned it. 

Then my husband and friend proceeded to order food at the bar separately. My husband stood at the bar for another 10 minutes before someone took our food and drink order. Luckily he closed out immediately. We waited for our food for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, my friend's food came, she ate and dirty dishes had been sitting in front of her for 5 minutes. During this time, I went to the restroom which also was filthy. All while employees barely would move out of my way while they stood there not working watching football indoors. 


The food was finally delivered. Cold. The burger was over cooked and nearly burnt. They proceeded to walk away without giving us plates, napkins, ketchup or picking up our friend's dirty dishes. I asked for each to happen. The bartender told me he was too busy to get the dirty plates. Then about 20 minutes later he came to get everyone's plates  by literally dragging over the trash can and bus pan. And dumping things in front of us at the table. Then he said he shift was over and he needed them to close out. 

Absolutely dirty, gross and terrible atmosphere. Poorly trained and unmanaged staff. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"I enjoy Carolina Ale so much! It is more than convenient bc of where I work, but the setting of the location it is placed itself is perfect and the hostesses are always welcoming! I never have a complaint about my food!"}
{"text":"Very loud, very busy. But it is a Saturday night. Ordered a burger split in half to share. They took care of that nicely. Ask for the burger well, pink inside. Sent it back still pink in the middle. Didn't bother to send it back again. Service was good."}
{"text":"Great food and great service even with a packed house on ACC Championship Saturday! Clive our server was the best and food was great!!!
Shrimp Tacos 
5 stars"}
{"text":"It's your average ale house. I'm visiting and I wanted to try something that wasn't in Jersey. Came here and it was just average nothing special. Probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I had been excited to try CAH since it's opening, but due to huge crowds, we had not been able to get in. So yesterday we went by there at 2:45 pm and lo and behold, nobody hardly there so we went in for lunch. Sad to say but we were very disappointed. To start off our server was so not there anytime we needed her. Twice I had to get up and go to the hostess to ask could she get our server. Now get this, there were four tables that had patrons in them and we literally waited almost 45 minutes for our food and another guy there at the bar said that was normal for them. Our server after thirty minutes actually said for about 15 minutes there was no one in the kitchen cooking tickets but our order would not tale long to fix. I was so upset. I talked to a manager, Libby, and she was super helpful and took 50% off our ticket plus gave us a coupon for 5 dollars off our next visit. That was OK and very nice of her. 
  Now to the food. The fish tacos were outstanding! They were very crispy, w got the fried, and had a lot on them. My friend had ordered the rice that regularly comes with them but she was served the beer battered fries side. Another mess up. I had the BBQ sandwich and it was just ok. I was under the impression from there website the food was made there fresh but there is no way that was homemade, on site BBQ. Bun was really good but too much sauce slathered on too. It too was served with those same beer battered fries. I wish they had just regular fries but sadly, they do not. I saw the other table near us had two salads and they looked good. I was just very underwhelmed. They also have no \"lunch\" menu, you pay full dinner prices at lunch. We did not like that either.
  Overall, I just cannot say it was a very nice dining experience. I was so disappointed. With the quality of service, I do not see how they do it when they are slammed busy. I will go back eventually, but will not be in any rush to try again."}
{"text":"This is your typical sports bar, but it has a good atmosphere and a large beer selection.

The food I received was very average. I had the grilled salmon salad, but the salmon was overcooked in my opinion. It tasted dry, and lost a lot of the freshness that is so critical to a good piece of salmon

It would be a good place to hangout or watch the game for sure, but not to go and have dinner."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received in a restaurant/bar. I tried this place out thinking it would be a good atmosphere to grab a burger and beer, but from the moment I sat down at the bar I had to wait at least 10 minutes before getting acknowledged by any staff members. Even once I was able to finally place an order for one beer it took a good while after that to get serviced for food. The staff members were more worried about interacting/socializing with one another rather than doing their job and serving their customers. On top of that they also had their buddies at the bar as well and would be paying more attention to them and not the customer. I would not recommend this place unless you intend to be ignored by their employees."}
{"text":"So much beer...and food!...and sports! As a guy, I love it. For my girlfriend, I think she appreciated there weren't any games on at the time so that I wasn't looking up the entire time, hah!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites spots in Concord so I have been many times on week nights and weekends. I always receive great service and my food is delish! The spinach dip with pita bread is my favorite appetizer.  I love the fact that they can split the cost of appetizers for you and put each person's share of the cost on their own receipt.  The place can be pretty crowded at times but I always get my food in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"I am in town on business for four days. Came here tonight on night 1. 

Pretty busy when I walked in. Sat at the bar (found a place without a problem) and was promptly asked what I wanted. Seeing a huge display of taps, I asked for a beer menu and was given one. Then waited a long time to order. Beer came and was asked if I wanted a dinner menu. I said yes, and then waited even longer to order. Food came out faster than expected and order a second beer.

At this point I'm happy. Or at least happier as I was a little upset with the wait time. But As I ate I found the aus ju sauce to be VERY salty. And I'm a man who loves salt. I ate half the sandwich and then needed a glass of water. I tried to get a waitresses attention and none came. No one asked if I needed anything and no one stopped by. So I hate bout 3/4 of that 2nd half and had to quit. Waited longer for her to take my card. 

Sandwich was good (salty), fries were great but unsalty, good beer. Worth the stop"}
{"text":"Not sure why the negative reviews bc our experiences have been awesome. We came kinda late but sat at the bar and have great service. Bartender was super friendly and attentive. We usually come to drink but this time we decided to have dinner. My dry rub grilled wings were AWESOME! It's so hard to find non battered and non fried wings, not to mention no sugary sauces and these were prefect! 6 wings plus two sides of both ranch and bleu cheese and carrots and celery for $7. My boyfriend have grilled fish tacos and enjoyed those as well. I had a hard time choosing bc I saw more than just bar food. There were several healthy and low carb options that you rarely see at bar/restaurant. Being a Louisiana girl I love that they have Abita on tap! We will definitely come back for more wings :)"}
{"text":"Very slow service, soup was room temperature, waitress had very little knowledge of the menu. Never asked if we would like another round of drinks, just handed the check. All of this and we were the first customers to walk through the door, 1 1/2 hours later, for 2 salads, a drink and dessert. Will never return!!"}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken sandwich was superb, service excellent. Wife loved her veggie pizza."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with 3 stars instead of 2 because we went right as the Panthers game let out so they were quite busy. 

When we got arrived, we were told by the hostess it would be a 10 minute wait for a table which in reality was a 25 minute wait. Whatever, it happens. We were seated and waited another 5 minutes or so for our waiter to appear. He started telling us about all the drafts which is great, but hostess had forgotten to give us a drink menu. He disappeared for another 5 minutes before returning with waters and the drink menu.

Great beer selection. About 75 beers on draft and another 90 or so bottles. We ordered beers and nachos with pulled pork to start. Drinks and nachos came out very quick. Nachos were cold and pork on top was in huge chunks rather than pulled which made it tough to eat. Entrees came out quick too and were better... We had boneless chicken wings and fish & chips. 

Overall an ok experience. Lots of TVs so we could enjoy the games. Restaurant was very cold where we were seated so we were happy to move on once we had eaten."}
{"text":"Where is the BLUE CHEESE!!!??!? Placed order. Asked for blue cheese or ranch. Answered blue cheese.  Got home. NO F'ING BLUE CHEESE!! Wings without blue cheese? Why the F do I have to check behind you?! It's not my job. My job is to pay! GD!!!!"}
{"text":"There's plenty to like about Carolina Ale House.  Not only does this place offer a welcomed reprieve from the hip and trendy establishments and people that populate the EpiCenter, but its also littered with screens, a friendly staff and the food is surprisingly - good. 

I've been here three times since it was opened this past fall.  This is a great spot to watch any big game, especially Monday or Thursday Night football.  

The honey bbq wings are awesome!  The are savory and crisp, but not overcooked.  I've also had a chance to try the chicken quesadillas and the chicken melt wrap - both of which are are delicious and are can't miss menu options if you don't know what to order.

I prefer to sit at the bar when at Carolina Ale House.  To be honest, I've never sat at a table, but I can vouch for the service of the bartenders.

Other than say, Fox and Hound, this might be the best spot to watch a big game in uptown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Decent. Not the best food but a laid-back environment for meeting friends. A bit louder than I prefer. But a good selection of drinks!"}
{"text":"Herman Cameron and Mana are the servers in this restaurant and i wanna give them the biggest shoutout for great customer service. We are here from New York and we are very please with the service ya have to offer! These 2 show so much dedication and was on point with the service! I will highly recommend ppl to come here to eat. Thank you again for a great experience"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but service is slooooow and inattentive. Not sure if it's because they are so new but we waited 30 minutes for food and 20 minutes for our second round of drinks. We even watched the waitress pour a beer that had been sitting out for too long tell us she would get a new pour and then simply put the same beer in a new cold glass! Shady. Sad because it's such a great location but they need to get their customer service act together."}
{"text":"4 stars for draft selection 0 stars for attention to detail and service. They gave us breaded buffalo instead of grilled BBQ wings that we ordered. The guy next to me sent his wing order back twice cuz the first time they gave him the wrong sauce and the second time they forgot to put any sauce on them. Also the crowd is a dumb mix of tourists and try-hard locals. Great view of a pond?"}
{"text":"Had the Philly cheesy steak on a busy Sunday. Took awhile, it was good but not great. About 6 hours later the fun started. Woke up with food poisoning. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Our first time and the food and service was great. We got wings honey buffalo half fried half grilled and chicken tacos. Our serves name was Lottie and she had a trainee his name is James! If I could I would give them 1000 stars. They were the best!!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this place a handful of times, the first 2 times the food was actually really good!!. The past few have been the excact same problems with different orders. Honestly I dont think it deserves 2 stares but im trying to be fair. Everything I have ordered lately from nachos to burgers even mashed potatos have came out like they were sitting in the frige for an hour before it got to my table. My wife had a fried chicken salad which the chicken on it was served cold which i noticed someone else yelps about that, whats up with that. A ton of tvs so if you trying to watch a game thats cool but the place is super loud forget trying to talk to anyone your sitting with kinda nerve racking after a bit"}
{"text":"The main issue I have is they allow people to vape inside. You cant smoke, but vaping and blowing vapor all over the bar area is apparently OK.

HUGE on tap selection. Decent menu at decent prices, but they dont give you enough fries with the burgers. Pool tables are only $1 a game too."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible! Staff were rude when they did engage and this was after waiting 20-30 minutes to get a drink. I suggest buying local instead of wasting money at this place."}
{"text":"Have been here many times.  Actually twice this week due to business meetings.  First visit we had a very large party with a reservation that was placed earlier in the week.  When we got there, nobody seemed to know about the reservation.  Everyone ended up sitting outside.  We had approximately  25 people in the party and ONE main server.   She was running crazy but was very pleasant.  Had to ask multiple times for refills. However, food was good.  

Second visit of the week.  Party of 10 this time.  Once again, sat ouside.  Once again, ONE main server. Appetizers took forever.  Half of party received main entree and were finished eating before other half of party received their meal. Again, food quality was good.  Service, very slow.  

My bottom line opinion, the people working here seem to have very pleasant attitudes....work very hard...but they are just spread too thin. More servers are need on a consistent basis. Period."}
{"text":"I must say I've been a fan of CAH for a number of years but this location has really won me over in my last couple of visits. Last night a friend and I stopped in for some wings and a few beers. CAH is always a great place to catch a game or sit on the patio. We ordered a dozen Buffalo wings and an order of the bacon cheese fries. In full disclosure I was very disappointed in the cheese fries but the wings were outstanding. The sauce was flavorful and the wings had plenty of meat. Our bartenders were friendly and worked hard. The atmosphere was great, restroom was clean and there's plenty of parking. I will definitely be coming back and I'm sure the experience will be the same"}
{"text":"This place is close to my job, so I come here occasionally. My last two visits, including today, have not been good. The service was horrible and really slow. We had to ask for refills. My food wasn't cooked how I asked. When we asked if we could sit outside, the hostess had to go \"check\". Then, when we finally get outside and pick a table,  the umbrella doesn't work. We picked another table, and that umbrella didn't work.  We finally got lucky on the 3rd try. Just really disappointed by what I have seen here lately."}
{"text":"Was a weekly regular. They used to have awesome wings (dry rub) , but then they screwed them up and raised the prices. Stopped going as I couldn't stand it."}
{"text":"I've liked Carolina Ale House since my days in Raleigh. I've been to this location in Uptown a few times. The food isn't something that you can't find somewhere else, but the wings and burgers are good. The reason I like this place is because I can go in at 11pm, have a drink and find a seat to watch the game. I have yet to find a lot of places Uptown where you can do this."}
{"text":"The service here sucks basketball sized balls! 30 minutes to get a server to my table, 30 to get my burger to the table. Should've gone to the Waffle House"}
{"text":"I met my bf and a group of his coworkers here for happy hour. It's located on the corner of College and 4th street and boasts plenty of outside dining which I'm sure is popular when the weather is nice. Even though there are TVs everywhere inside and it was crowded, it didn't seem as loud as I thought it would be. 

I ordered a pound cake bomb ($6.50) which is a Blue Moon and a shot of vanilla vodka and Bailey's to drop into the Blue Moon. And it was really good. I also had the Velvet Revolver ($6.50) and that was good too, but I liked the pound cake bomb better. It tasted like a dessert and I had no problem shooting it.

 For food, I ordered the Picky Platter ($9.99) and an order of dry rub chicken wings (10 for $8.29). The picky platter came with fried pickles, mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, and chicken tenders. I liked the fried pickles and the chicken wings and the rest were just average with the mozzarella sticks being my least favorite. The platter came with a side of ranch and marinara sauce for dipping. I think the price was really good considering how much you get. You're at a bar so I'm pretty sure you're not expecting gourmet stuff so I would suggest this as something to munch on to help soak up the alcohol. 

The dry rub chicken wings were suggested on yelp and they did not disappoint. By the time I ate the food, I was already two drinks in on a stomach that only had raw juice all day (I guess I blew my diet here :/ I needed a drink!) so I don't really have the words to describe the food, so sorry about that. lol. I just know what I liked and what was just okay and that next time I would just order the dry rub wings and the fried pickles.

I consider the service as decent since we were able to get what we wanted, when we wanted but I know that some of our friends couldn't find their waitress at times and ended up having to go up to the bar to order. Other than that, it was a typical happy hour bar experience. I'd return but only after trying some of the other bars in Uptown.

{"text":"Let me just say my family will never be back. I went there after the movies tonight March 17,2017 @ 11:59 they close at 2am. Me and my husband was at the table waiting on a server for 16 minutes. No one, not one person came to the table. Server was walking by and not one of them girl stop to say one word. We will never go back."}
{"text":"New management?  New take on classic items like Chicken Nachos?
By far, the worst nachos I have ever eaten- anywhere. Sad thing is, not too long ago CAH had some of the best nachos I have ever eaten.

First thing you notice is the serving size is smaller, ok no problem. But, the nachos came out in a dirty pan (and not dirty because the current meal was messy).

Most disturbing was the \"chicken.\" It was difficult to determine if it was chicken or pork, the very small amount of meat was not recognizable (visually, or by palate). Maybe, if there were more meat, we would've been able to discern. We even asked the waitress to confirm it was chicken, she said because it was dark meat chicken, people often could not tell if it was chicken or pork. I have never had a problem differentiating pork from chicken. But, I digress.

They also add this queso-like spicy cheese to the nachos, which must come in a squeeze bottle because it covered everything- I think what CAH is hoping is that that new sauce hides the fact they haven't really put any meat on it. I asked the waitress if it was new sauce, she had no clue as she'd only worked there for a couple of months. 

I ended up just taking a to-go tray, because I had to leave. But, those \"nachos\" should have been sent back to the kitchen and destroyed. Now, they're at the edge of my desk waiting to be thrown away!

CAH takes for granted that they are in a prime location and people are always coming in. For the folks that work and live over here, it is likely we will not return."}
{"text":"The service is slow it seems like they're always short staffed. I had called for a Togo order and show up 15 minutes later and had to wait another 20 minutes to get my food. The staffs are not the friendliest neither because they're always busy. Food is decent,their breading for the mozzarella sticks are not crispy like most places. It's like a funnel cake breading,which I'm not a fan,sorry. 
The chicken zingers are pretty good, I really like the fiery thai sauce ,it's spicy and yummy!! 
Their fries are not crispy neither,but not bad."}
{"text":"After attending a Yelp elite event here, I went downstairs with a few friends for dessert. We all had the Mud Pie. Warm brownie with cookies and cream ice cream, chocolate syrup and caramel. It was warm and delicious. I was craving a brownie sundae and It hit the spot."}
{"text":"Let me first say the only reason this got 2 stars is because the fried pickles were decent. I got the pub burger and it was supposed to be the best. It was bland and boring. The fries tasted like they were made yesterday and reheated. . My husband got s cup of chili. He said it was cold and more like chopped veggies and meat. He and a friend split some wings and they said they were ok. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here, just came to watch the game & have a few drinks.

I was VERY impressed with the selection of beers.  There were TVs everywhere to watch the game.

The only reason I'm removing a star is that a few of the beers that my group ordered  were out, or the keg was kicked, or misbehaving or whatever beers do."}
{"text":"First time here. Great service and friendly staff. Had the Ruben and cheese steak. Will dine here again"}
{"text":"There was no hostess when we walked in and the sign said seat your self and we found a booth and waited over 8 min to have anyone check on us. The salad was limp and the spinach dip tasted off. I will say once we got service the server was good.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Fun late night spot with sports. DeShawn is the man, one step ahead of you the whole time!"}
{"text":"The Ale house is a good place to come to watch a game or celebrate a win. The atmosphere is good and the beer cold. The food is pretty standard bar food. A decent burger and lots of fried fare. Nothing outstanding but if you are looking for pub grub and a screen to watch the game it will more than do."}
{"text":"Went tonight for a few drinks. 2 bartenders were very rude, disinterested, and unprofessional. Employees outside smoking in front of patrons. Employees were  joking and picking in front of customers while I was inside. I will never go back to this place. 


Great location and a new place. The whole staff from hostesses to waitresses seemed overwhelmed with the crowd on a Saturday at 5:00. I was kinda turned off by the \"roughness\" of the waitresses as most seemed disinterested in their job. The caesar salad was average. 
I am sure this place is great for drinks but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Great place. Love sitting over the pond but pls do something so that it will survive. Cleaning throughout was sorely neefed"}
{"text":"I like this place. 

Right across the street from the Omni and BB&T, it's a convenient place to catch some sports. 

Probably 50 beers on tap, it's a well stocked sports bar with a ton of TVs. Probably not a bad seat in the place. 

Bar staff was super friendly I really liked the chicken tenders. 

If you're in uptown, you should check it out."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection! I gave them a point because they had Avery on tap! Avery is an all time favorite brewery out in beer capital of the USA Colorado. 

The selection is fantastic and a beer night such as a Wednesday hint hint makes it a great place to drink downtown. Yeah cheap micros is always a plus! Food well it's ok but the word ale house means alcohol to me ! Food is optional.

I'll be back because the selection of beers is a kickass and it's on the downtown bar hop tour."}
{"text":"We waited until the grand opening rush seemed to be over. For a Friday after work we were seated quickly. They seem to have everything figured out now. Fast service. Good atmosphere. A tent I've and polite server. Food was great for the price."}
{"text":"I ordered their Buffalo chicken sandwich.  The chicken was very dry and seemed like it was just reheated.  The portion was very small which was probably good since it was so dry and overcooked.  The beer was cold and the service good.  I have eaten there a few years ago and don't remember any negatives from then.  I am not sure if I just got a bad sandwich or if the food has gone downhill.  Regardless because of the meager size of the sandwich I will likely not eat there in the future."}
{"text":"They really let the food just go right down the drain. Nothing is delicious anymore. You best stick with burgers and wings. And of course if your beer lover which we are then it takes the sting off a bit LOL"}
{"text":"Food was fair, service was fair. Rude and obnoxious people sitting next to us were terrible. Not sure why people have to swear and yell in a restaurant! And what's up with management not asking them to quite down??"}
{"text":"Went in after church on Sunday, not crowded and we got seated right away, then proceeded to be completely ignored for the next 15 minutes and couldn't even get water or a beer list from the numerous employees that kept walking by! To say they need better staff is an understatement. We were hungry and figured it would be hours before we actually got food, so we left and had an awesome lunch at Fort Mill BBQ."}
{"text":"Went to this bar right after the NBEO exam because it was the first bar in sight! They have an interesting selection of bomb drinks. The pound cake bomb was good! It's similar to an irish car bomb but with blue moon. Great sports bar and good appetizers on happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm in town for business and this place to close to my hotel (Omni). Probably in the top five wing places I've ever been! I got the baked wings, spicy habanero style. They were so delicious I got six if the regular fried style , spicy Thai. Both were cooked perfectly and I could tell they were indeed fresh and not previously frozen. Very tender. Fries weren't soectacular. Beer was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is ok. Went in there Sunday 1/28 around 3pm. Sat at a high table near the bar and waited about 10 minutes before i even saw a waitress.  This place was not that busy.  I did see a few people over by the kitchen with their phones out. Ordered 2 beers (because i honestly didn't expect to see the waitress again until my food came out. The burger was pretty good.  All in all, nothing special with a young staff that doesn't seem very thrilled to work there.  Probably won't return any time soon."}
{"text":"Spacious!

Nice servers and friendly hostess. 

Bathrooms are clean.

The calamari was really good, especially paired with a sweet sauce.

The end."}
{"text":"No matter how many chances we give them, they just can't seem to pull together a decent service experience. Bar staff was particularly surly this evening although patrons seem in good spirits and patient with slow, unfriendly staff. Food was \"as expected\" for bar food. Tap lines need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"The wings were really good, but the service was pretty awful. I was there with a little over a dozen people from my office. We were spread out over about 4 tables by the bar. We waited, on average, 10-15 minutes for drinks, every time we ordered. We were literally 6 feet from the bar. It was busy but not super busy...Plus, it's not like the servers were getting drinks for EVERYONE every time they took an order... just 2 or 3 here and there. My one coworker ordered a beer which never came. He had to order it again from a different server. I only had 2 drinks the entire time i was there because no one would come and take our orders. My theory for situations like this is that the servers already know they're getting an automatic gratuity added to the tab (because of the party size), so they don't bother taking good care of them.

On top of that, I got to listen to a large bald guy (presumably a manager) berate a server who evidently had screwed up an order. Not sure if this is how things usually work in the service industry, but I was surprised by what followed. He told her that she had to figure out a way to make them pay for the items (which they hadnt ordered) or she had to pay for it out of her pocket. I wasn't impressed.

I don't see myself returning any time soon."}
{"text":"The place is located in the beautifully new Kingsley area with Fort Mill. Perfect location for this restaurant and for the size of it would be a great place to catch the game. 

Our server was Cally. She was great and attentive. As we sat and listened to her speaking to other guests, you can tell that she is a true pro. Glad we sat and actually stayed to at least see how the service would play out. 

One note to add: The most important point of contact to a restaurant is the host. It's the beginning and end, the front face and the person who sets the mood for the guests experience. 
So essentially the host should be inviting and engaged. I would like to see this improved here. 
Make me feel welcomed and that you're excited to see people. Be vocal when greeting and not quite or shy. When walking me to my table, turn around and have that \"elevator\" conversation. Rather escorting me throughout the entire restaurant towards outside in silence. Find out why the guests choose to come here and see if there is a game that you can turn the tv to. Overall, speak up! Engage! Make the impact! Sell the brand!

Other than that, we look forward in returning."}
{"text":"Last time I went there they had Harp again. So they'll go up a star. If you have a large party -- Go elsewhere or get there early (or a slow day). We had to wait about 50 minutes for a party of 8..."}
{"text":"Very delicious ice cold beer... Food was awful.  Grilled chicken tasted like subways."}
{"text":"If you are looking for beer selection - great place, but food is not so good. Fish and chips - fish not crispy and chips very greasy. Beef sandwich with au jus - high sodium.  Fried pickles covered in oil. Waitress - very good stopped by to check on us at just the right time."}
{"text":"Not sure what's happened but the food and service has gone from OK to just bad. Lots of other options in the area to choose from."}
{"text":"We asked twice to bring what we ordered, they refused to bring our order. No apology! And one angry server who made my wife feel bad when she asked how good are the ribs, she replied with disgust \"I don't eat pork\" Could have said I don't know, haven't tried them. Poor service!"}
{"text":"First time a few weeks ago. We enjoyed the brisket Nachos that paired great with our local beers! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"From the vast research I've done (give me a break, I'm a west coaster), this is a chain that changes the first word of the name based on the location. I figured, though, I might as well review it for any of those visiting Charlotte on a whim. 

Bar food was fried and greasy in the bad way. If you like your fried food crispy, this isn't the place to go. I had tried the fried pickles, chicken wings, and chicken tenders. The spinach and artichoke dip was decent, but a little too decadent for my own good. 

The best part about the ale house, though is the $3 pint. They have a huge selection to choose from. My favorite is the Sweet Water Blue which is your basic Sweet Water with a dash of blueberries. It's a bit fruity, but guys order it too! For the adventurous types, I also tried the Shotgun Betty which is banana bubble gum-flavored beer. I couldn't finish the glass."}
{"text":"Met up with a few friends for dinner. The food was pretty good. Wings had great flavor!! 
I ordered a mixed drink and it just didn't taste like I thought it would. So I decided I was going to go with my usual redbull and vodka..... they did not have any redbull... I was a pretty disappointed. finally I asked the waitress what she would recommend as a drink I told her what I liked and she said the panther prowl is a good choice. So I ordered that and it was better than the 1st drink but it was a really sour. My friend ordered the same and hers was more sweet. I hope the next time we return they will have redbull so I can have my Redbull vodka."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite before my flight out of Charlotte and they had A LOT OF TVs! So if you want to catch a game, they have TV's everywhere!! I ate the bacon cheese burger and that was big and juicy! 

I ate the wings as for my appetizers and that was pretty filling. Napkins are going to be your best friend on that dish. I ate half buffalo and the rest were honey bbq.  

They were all very good and the food was decent quality."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is gone completely downhill over the last few years. It used to be a good place to come hang out and watch some sports games but lately the food is gone incredibly bad and the services become even worse.  However this is just my opinion because the place is always packed. Like anything else you probly just need to go and give it a shot but it really is not that great"}
{"text":"If u like to eat in the dark this place is for you!! I'm not joking, you just see the silhouette of your food!! I asked my waitress to see if the lights could be turned up - they turned them up!! We can now see what we're eating!!! I had a cheese burger - it was very nice! Happy with my choice. I would come back as long as I can see what I'm eating!! My friend got the pulled pork sliders - the pork was kind of hard but the flavor was good."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great selection of beer on tap
Good food and prices
Friendly staff

Cons:
Not sure I would take children there, it seems more like an adult place, but I could be wrong

Overall good place.  Plenty of tvs to watch different games on.  Actually ended up eating here a couple of times on one trip.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well we were seated fast. After that no so impressive. Service was slow. Food came out over cooked. O and they were not busy at all but blamed the long wait on the kitchen being backed up. They need to do a lot of work to bring things up to acceptable standards."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Carolina Ale House, and will probably be my last. Although the burgers were good, the drinks were overpriced and the service was not very good overall."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great drink prices.   Great sports watching.  

What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Went this afternoon for lunch. Big mistake. I ordered the grilled chicken tacos and they were so spicy I literally only ate one bite. When I asked the bartender why they were so spicy she rolled her eyes at me and said \"because they're spicy chicken tacos.\" I grabbed a menu to look. Nope. Grilled chicken tacos. I ordered fries instead of rice and they weren't even warm, let alone hot. My boyfriend had the Carolina dipper which wasn't terrible but defiantly not great. His fries were also cold. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today because I've been to other ale house locations and they have good food. Host was not very friendly at all. We ordered the fry basket with the poutine sauce for an appetizer. The appetizer came out with no cheese curds so I asked the server if it was supposed to come with them which I knew it did and she tried to tell me it was just a cheese sauce but she went and checked the menu and saw that it was supposed to come with cheese curds so she asked if we wanted an order of just cheese curds instead of just offering to make new fries the correct way. I ordered the hamburger sliders for my entree and a Greek side salad. The burgers were over cooked and dry with no flavor. I wanted a Greek side salad but was given a small Greek salad with chicken that the server charged me $6 for. I didn't even say anything because the appetizer was already messed up. Other people at my table order fish and chips and the fried chicken special. Fish had a weird texture to it. And the fried chicken special was a chicken filet not bone and nothing special. Service was ok, she wasn't very friendly but she wasn't rude either. Server did not know the menu at all. Overall, had a bad experience and definitely will not return"}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent! They have a vast selection of craft beer. The amount of TVs make it a perfect place to come and watch sports. Very cool atmosphere and the bartenders are very friendly."}
{"text":"I waited a good bit before visiting Carolina Ale House. Learning from experience, new restaurants need some time to train the staff and run through common practice. That said, the food was good, nothing off the charts but it's a chain, so at least you can expect the same good food at every location. Service isn't top notch but I think they are still trying to find the right people for the area. I am not one to quit visiting over an \"okay\" experience. The sweet potato fries are too good to not go back once in a while."}
{"text":"It took 45 minutes to get 5 orders out. My Caribbean tuna sandwich was cold, and the plate was flooded with cole slaw sauce. The bottom of the brooch bun was soaked. Disgusting. Not all of our plates came out at the same time, the waitress proceeded to ask us how the last burger needed to be cooked. WHAT, most of us have our food and two of the 5 dishes haven't even been started yet?! 
Such a shame. Great location, good atmosphere. Horrible food service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch a couple days ago and can't say had any complaints.  Its a very large place with two floors and tons of TV's.  Definitely has potential to be a great place to watch a game.  I will be going back soon just for that reason.  I got a cup of chili, just so I could try it and it was above average.  I really like a good  chili :) I ended up getting some type of  turkey avocado wrap for my lunch and it was decent.  This is not a classy play, but it is nice and it seems to be above average bar food.  My friend got the turkey club pita and that also looked very decent.  They are in the process of building the outdoor patio, so that will just add to possibilities."}
{"text":"A large Sports Bar in Uptown Charlotte served with a heaping side of casual dining. 

Location: 4/5
A hop, skip and a throw away from the Epicentre. That's if a hop, skip and a throw equates to a block. 

Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3.5/5
80% Sports Bar. 20% Family Restaurant. The crowd is usually a medium size group of friends having dinner and drinks and not a group of die-hard sport fans. There's a good amount of televisions but there could be more. If the Panthers are playing you'll have to maneuver around to find a table near the lonely screen showing any other games. 

Cleanliness: 4/5
There weren't any glaring problems but you should expect a level of quality equal to a chain restaurant.

Service: 3.5/5
Waitress was engaged but seemed like a bit of a salesmen trying to talk us into more rounds and food. Another table's bill was brought to us as well but it was an honest mistake to make given that the establishment was packed. 

Booze: 5/5
A wide assortment of beers from all over the nation. It sucked that both our first choices were out so we had to go with the Sam Adams Oktoberfest. I was pretty disappointed because I had not seen Golden Monkey any where else in Charlotte. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"The food is definitely 4 or 5 star caliber. With the exception of a small hair in one of my French fries, the picky platter and triple b burger were fantastic! Their signature cocktail, the Panther Prowl, was deliciously tangy and fruity! I would recommend the food to all of my friends, so why would I give only three stars? When we were finally seated after about a 45 minute wait (which I assume is standard after a Panthers game), we had to wait an additional FIFTEEN MINUTES before we finally resorted to flagging someone down to take our drink orders. We were passed by waiters probably 20 times in that time-frame, some who gave us the ol' side eye. Fifteen minutes. That is just unacceptable! The waiter we finally managed to flag down wasn't even working our part of the section, but he took our orders anyway (which was great since we were on the verge of eating our menus). Ordinarily in this situation, having worked at a few restaurants myself, you would expect some sort of discount or some sort of acknowledgment, none of which we got. My boyfriend was conflicted about leaving only $8 on a $76 bill because our waiter took our orders outside of his section, but the fact that we waited so long just for an initial order was just awful. Go for the food, but don't expect anywhere near quick/good service."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night, was able to be seated immediately for a party of three and a half. (2yr old) We had a good waiter who only missed a glass of water. Menu is pretty basic for bar & grill food.

The wings were pretty good. Chicken quesadillas were good except the spicy  sauce. My husband said they put too much stuff on the shrimp tacos, his tortillas were soggy. Mini sliders were tasty. 

Over all good good experience.  Not sure why they feel the need to charge so much though."}
{"text":"Typical bar food, awesome beer selection.  Based out of Raleigh, they are big supporters of the Carolina Hurricanes, and the Charlotte location supports their farm team, the Charlotte Checkers.  Very good sports bar environment with a second level for events such as Hurricanes watch parties.  If you're rating the food, it's meh, but if you're rating the beer, it's A-OK."}
{"text":"Came here for my sons birthday last Saturday. Everyone from the area knows how busy Concord gets on the weekends, why this place doesn't have call ahead seating is bizarrre. If not management should consider using open table. Typical wait time was 1 hr! We were seated. The waitress was either slow or it was too busy to be serviced effectively? I ordered a mojito, it was horrible, I had to send it back for a beer. Some positives I ordered a steak medium rare, and it was actually cooked correctly. Typically when I order steak its over cooked even when I request medium rare. The wings are good too, and yes, get them fried. I'm not providing higher rating due to poor mixology from the bar, slow wait staff, and the excessive wait time to be seated."}
{"text":"Was so excited for this place.  Great location!  But service is absolutely dreadful.  The hostesses are clueless.  The waitresses have no personality (2 dinners).  And quite frankly none of them easy on the eyes!  Clearly an angry woman hired everyone.  They hired bottom of the barrel staff to look at and serve.  Food mediocre at best.  The view of water is great.  Great tvs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before hitting the mall. Ordered a Long Island and got a glass of sour mix. Hardly any alcohol. And I mean hardly any. Watched her make it. Sent it back of course.  Them ordered the sampler platter appetizer. Apparently I said the the name wrong because she corrected me. A few minutes later a gentleman brought me a basket of fried pickles. He prints my order and that's what she put in. NOT the sampler. To top off everything else the other bartender was make sodas for the couple next to us and stuck her bare hand in the ice machine grabbing ice cubes and proceeded to eat them."}
{"text":"First off, THANK GOODNESS this place is open till 2AM.  We are late night munchers (though we try not to) and constantly strive to find restaurants that are open late with great food.  
Carolina Ale House is definitely one the best places for late night food especially if you live in couple miles vicinity of the Kingsley Park area.  
ambience is a 10/10 without a doubt, the indoor seating is your regular bar style seating with booths, bar stools etc., the outside is a whole different game.  The outdoor seating is just awesome, with view of the water and tall buildings on the other side of that small lake.  The outdoor bar area is pretty sexy with lounge style couches around.  
Food - We loved the food so far.  Wife is a spicy chicken wing freak, the spicier, more the love.  Grilled Chicken wings with Fiery Thai sauce is the winner for us.  actually one of their spiciest sauces in the menu and it's the bomb (if you are into spicy stuff).  We also tried the fried version of the wings and its even better (you get that crunch, wow!).
My personal favorite is the Greek Chicken Pita, its so lite and flavorful.  Loaded with grilled chicken breast meat with fresh veggies, olives and feta.  Not sure if the pita itself is homemade but tasted fresh and soft all the times.
Mashed potatoes - Love their take on mashed potatoes, its actually a bit dry here and that's what caught our interest (weird, right) but hey!!
Veggie Burger is another surprise - it actually felt healthy coz, there is no mayo or some kind of trans fat for the spread but guacamole.  its black bean burger, with veggies and guac spread with fresh salsa.  winner in my book!
Definitely a great place for food and a even better place for the ambience (outdoor seating!)"}
{"text":"TAYLOR was our server and is probably one of the most rude people I've ever had. She came to our table after multiple times with a bad attitude and even proceeded to leave the table as i was telling her what i wanted to drink...... i don't know if she's new at this or what but she needs some more training. I'm very disappointed because i was here Saturday night and our server was absolutely amazing...... just a disappointed customer."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to some more craft beer options in Fort Mill, so when Carolina Ale House opened I had to try it out.

The restaurant is located in the new Kingsley development across from the Brixx Wood Fired Pizza, and beside the amphitheater. The design is similar to most other CAH locations; open concept with the bar in the middle of the space. I have been here a couple of times and each time the place was fairly packed, with about a 45 minute wait.

The food was decent, nothing spectacular, but not bad either. The wings were good, the pulled pork nachos were good. Unfortunately, the burgers left something to be desired.

On to the beer; the place has roughly 80 taps, 10-15 of which were dedicated to your typical mega-brewery offerings (bud, bud light, miller, blue moon, etc...), the rest were standard offerings from more well known regional/national craft breweries, and some local breweries. All in all it was a very safe, uninspired beer menu. No special releases, big imperial IPA's or imperial stouts, sours, etc... Don't get me wrong, there were a few solid beers in there, but nothing that would make me want to plan a special trip there to get it.

The service was another low point for me. Our waitress was missing in action for most of our visit, brought the wrong beer at least once, and was clueless about the beer menu. At one point I had to go up to the bar to get another beer for myself, and a refill of sweet tea for another member of our group. When I got to the bar, I noticed that there were about 6-7 beers sitting up there presumably waiting on a server to come pick them up, with the ticket floating in the top of the beer... 

All in all, both times I have visited this location have been quite disappointing. I would say that the rating should be 2 - 2.5 stars, but I rounded up to 3 since they have only been open a couple of months, and probably haven't found their groove yet... I will give them a while and update this rating"}
{"text":"They've only been open for a few weeks so I'm sure they are still ironing out the kinks. It's pretty crowded as all restaurants in the area are but we were seated quickly and our waitress Devin was great. My fish and chips was excellent except I think whoever made the slaw that day chopped up that cabbage and carrots and forgot to put anything else in. I added a little ranch dressing and it was fine. Prices are about right for the area. About the same or a little cheaper than Hickory Tavern.  I fear that when the new hotel next door opens  that parking may get brutal. Will go back if we can find a parking spot."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have had no major issues. The food is mostly bar food but it is done well. I particularly like their beer battered fries. I usually get the handmade burgers and they are always good. I have also had their fish tacos which were decent but not anything outstanding.

The only minor issue that I had was my burger was slightly incorrect because the order takers usually do not write them down - major pet peeve of mine. They have plenty of beer on tap but it is priced higher than most of the local establishments. Also, one beer I ordered came in a can although the menu did not specify that. Don't get me wrong - cans are great vessels for beer as long as you pour them into a glass but I though it was going to be a draft.

You can sit outside at the bar or the patio - both overlook the lake. Unfortunately, the Kingsley Development does not allow dogs on the patios of the establishments.

Ultimately, this is a sports bar with a ton of TV's and better-than-average bar food. It is also open until 2 a.m. with a full menu. It is a good place to grab a burger or some wings and a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"We ordered the pulled pork nachos, and turned it into a game of find the pork. We all lost, very sparse on the pork. My kids ordered hamburgers and my wife ordered the Greek pizza they were very good. I ordered the grilled fish tacos which were not good. They were cold, the tortilla was cold , the only flavor I could taste was some Cole slaw on the bottom. If there was some kind of sauce put on them or some flavored hot sauce at the table it may have helped."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst service in uptown. I get that places are busy but you don't make people wait a ridiculous amount of time for service. This doesn't just apply to one instance but literally every single time I have been here. As Someone that works in this building I often find our group having no choice but to wander here to catch a game or a drink but Everytime is unbelievably awful. 

1) bars tenders - staff is nice but you can't have a full service bar with 50+ seats served by a single individual on a Thursday evening. 

2) Togo orders. Time and time again I have called this place and be given an order wait time of 15-20 minutes. I'm literally waiting right now and it's been 68 minutes. And still waiting

3) wait staff outdoors - with a nice seating arrangement you would expect multiple wait staff outside but again, the ale house management seems to think that 1 person is enough

Save your money but more importantly save your time cause I guarantee that is the one thing you will leave here without."}
{"text":"meh.  just ok.  food was blah and we waited awhile for it to come even though it was an easy order.

beer list very impressive.

service at the bar while friendly was spotty.  

nothing neither terribly good or bad about this place"}
{"text":"I was already familiar with the Carolina Ale House in Uptown Charlotte but decided to check out this recently opened one since it's closer to my area of town.

Came in on a busy Friday night with two other friends and I would say the staff seemed to be managing the crowd well.  It is a sports bar after all so it's pretty loud.  Our waitress was extremely enthusiastic and seemed very knowledgable of the menu.  Compared to the one Uptown, the staff at this one is far better and more friendly.

Didn't order any drinks that night so about the food.  I always like to try the signature dish at a place, it's what makes them unique so I went with the Pub Burger.  We also decided to share a plate of the Carolina Loaded Fries.  The Pub Burger is huge.  It is topped with bacon, cheese, onion ring strings, and a special sauce.  The burger tasted like your pretty standard burger from a bar and grill but the secret sauce did give it some character.  The real treat was the Carolina Loaded Fries.  They're topped with pulled pork, monterey jack cheddar, and a variety of other sauces. You'll need a second person to help you down these.  They were delicious and make it worth coming back here for alone.

Will stop back here again if in the area.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  I could be happy on drinks for a long time.  

The food... Not so much.  I got a full rack of ribs, and the fries were the best part.  The ribs tasted like pot roast, boiled in water.  Very disappointing.  

The fish tacos were tiny and not filling.  

Come for a beer and the 200 TVs.  Just not for dinner.

UPDATE:  The waitress was sweet.  I mentioned I didn't enjoy it (with no intention to send it back).  The manager only charged me for a side of fries (the fries were great, and the only part I finished).  That showed great class."}
{"text":"Service was ehh, so-so if that's a word, food was absolutely terrible. Frickles appetizer (fried pickles) arrived promptly, they were hot and tasted good. From there food was horrible. Not sure if they had to go round up the actual cow to make the burgers or what, but the burgers arrived the next day...Someone in my party ordered boneless wings which arrived with a side of nasty.

To summarize, just say no to CAH."}
{"text":"We just had the best waiter I have ever had in my life. His name is Anthony and he is awesome at his job. We had our 3 girls with us and he was so attentive. The kids wrote him thank you notes. The food was good, my beer flight was great, and the experience made it even better. Thanks Anthony!"}
{"text":"We waited for half an hour and no-one greeted us. After asking couple of servers, they just rudely told us that they will ask someone in the kitchen to come and help us. We finally got tired and left. Never had any experience like this before!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the burger and fries. Burger was like eating a hockey puck and fries tasted like they were cooked in old oil. Would not go back again"}
{"text":"Not great.  Food was cold and less than average.  Waitress was lackadaisical and acted like she was reciting lines from a script.  Zero interpersonal skills.  Got the feeling the place just serves food to keep its liquor license.  Place was nearly dead on race Sunday when all of Concord was packed.  This should be a sign to management, but looking at all these less than stellar reviews, it appears they care as much as the wait staff.  Won't return."}
{"text":"This one is a no brainier. If you are in Uptown Charlotte and like great beer and great food, this is the place. Try the dry rubbed wings! This place hits on all cylinders."}
{"text":"I'm not a big beer fan so I'll just comment on the food. There is something about the fries that makes them extra delicious. I think they're coated in something. I had the pimento bacon burger with fries and it was great. The service is good as well. We've been about four times and I always order the same thing."}
{"text":"Carolina Ale house is a nice sized bar in Uptown with a big patio, but other than that it's always fell short for me. The food is mediocre and the service is hit or miss. However, they do have a nice selection of beers (at least 20 drafts). Don't get me wrong, I always happen to end up here time after time so it must not be that bad ;-) Overall there's nothing spectacular here, but it's always fun for game days."}
{"text":"As sports bars go, this is a great setup in a great location.  Unfortunately, the service was so bad yesterday, my friends and I left at half time of the Panthers game.   Bartenders, waitresses, busboys, and hostess all acted like they didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"You guys better step it up. Word is out about crappy service and delayed food. Service is everything if you want to stay in business"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a sporting event as they have 100 TV's in this place. There is no bad seat or view and the place is well lit. 

We ordered the cheese fries and they were very dry. They needed a cheese sauce versus shredded cheese popped under a broiler. Loved the cheese curds. They came out hot and well seasoned. The chicken sliders were okay but very dry. Perhaps lettuce and tomatoes would make them more appealing. 

Will come back with the kids as they will like the big booths and all the TV's."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  The sweet potato fries were cold and my ahi tuna sandwich was over cooked.  Do not get the mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes taste like they were cooked the day before and sat under a heater all day."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was amazing! I left Charlotte for a few and was excited to come back and go to my old stomping grounds CAH and I couldn't believe how downhill it went over the course of a few years. Big mistake not having Robert the manager there now! Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Food is pretty bland and service was pretty sad.   Pitiful because this is the only place open late on Sunday.    Wish other businesses would take notice and stay open."}
{"text":"The food is good, BUT THE VIEW OF THE LAKE and outside bar are outstanding! Finally, we have a hotspot in little ole' FM. Great place to hang with the gang. Yay!"}
{"text":"An overcrowded, disappointing sports bar. The only thing going for them is the location. Food is typical fast bar food - fried everything. Service, especially at the bar, is virtually non-existent. And I don't say that because it can get busy during games; I've been there when there are just as much staff as there are customers and couldn't get a drink.

Perfect example, this evening. While I unfortunately agreed to meet someone there, I was very early. I thought I'd grab a drink at the bar. I thought wrong. I sat at the bar, saw 4 different employees behind the bar, and couldn't get a drink if I jumped up on the bar and did the truffle shuffle. I noticed other patrons trying to get their attention: another drink, pay the bill, etc. It appeared they were all frustrated as well. I left to grab a drink at Fleming's next door instead."}
{"text":"This place is like every other bar with a restaurant attached, mediocre... The food was all bland. It was way too loud in the just restaurant area. This area of town is packed with this same type of restraun-tainment type place... Go somewhere else in my opinion."}
{"text":"Tons of TVs - great for football and basketball.
The tons of appetizers we got were all good.
The beer selection was fantastic!
I'll go back."}
{"text":"Since I work in Kingsley and watched this place being built over the last six months, I was eager to try it. Apparently there are some growing pains to endure before it realizes its full potential. On balance, the food was good, but the staff needs remedial service training NOW for the joint to avoid a bad reputation. Disinterested and aloof service got in the way of what I had hoped would be a pleasant meal.

It was moderately busy at lunch and the hostesses were oddly discombobulated, which was very disconcerting. What are they like when it's REALLY busy? First impressions count, and the staff seemed to be in an awful hurry to throw that impression into a dumpster. I did not want to eat at the outside bar, and because it was a beautiful day I inquired about the tables that line one side of the building outside facing a lake. I was told they did not have the wait staff to manage that area, so I had to eat inside. Wrong answer -- really, no fooling -- WRONG ANSWER! You can scare off A LOT of trade that way. 

My instincts and previous experience suggested I ought to leave but I stuck with it out of curiosity. Once I'm seated I have a five-minute limit to be waited on, no exceptions. Shoddy service is my number one pet peeve. My waiter showed up with 10 seconds to spare. He was competent, empathetic and not detached, which singled him out from a staff that confuses quick movements with actual service. Does anyone take pride in their work anymore?  

I ordered the Pub Burger, which was quite tasty and juicy, but a little on the messy side. It was fairly noisy with music in the restaurant and fraught with manic activity by the staff, but I've been in far busier places where the staff's activity does not call attention to itself. I'd like to come back after work to try one of the many beers on tap, but it'll be some time later after they work out the obvious kinks with the staff. Head's-up, management!"}
{"text":"I had salmon with mixed vegetables and a caesar salad. The Caesar salad dressing was good but an awful lot of it. The salmon was very flaky and tender but was way too salty for me. Vegetables were a little over cooked."}
{"text":"Our servers were nice they just wasn't on the same page. Since we had a party of 12 we had 2 serves waiting on us. The fist server to half of the tables order and told us the other waitress would come and take the other half of the table order. Mind you we had already placed our drink orders that took about 15 minutes to come. We waited for 20 minutes before we had to stop our waitress and ask her was she going to take our half of the table order. Of course this through the whole night off. The other half of the table hit their food way before our half of the table did. It was another 20 minutes before our half of the table got our good. Granted both waiters came out and apologized for not being on the same page and for not submitting all the orders at once. She said the manager scolded them for submitting them separate at different times. When we asked to speak to the manager he flipped it and said well you guys are a large party things take a while. Not to mention our orders came out wrong. At this point I'm to hungry to send my order back so I just kept it and ate it. A few other people refused to keep there orders. We ask for the manager again. Let me just say he lacked good customer service. I wasn't looking for a free meal but I feel he could have did a little more to rectify the situation. His response was well I will take back what you didn't eat but you're paying for your drinks. I was pretty much over it by this point. I feel the manager needs a lot more training."}
{"text":"We love this place for the beer and sports bar atmosphere. With that being said, their food is not horrible, I've just had better food at other sports bars. Although this time we did get an order of the pulled pork nachos and they were EXCELLENT! When we got our burgers they were way over cooked. We ordered them medium and got them almost burnt. We still ate them anyways. Service is normally decent. Waitresses have always been friendly. Service time is lacking a little bit. But overall we really enjoy going to the Carolina Ale House when we come in town."}
{"text":"This place is between three and four stars, initially when they opened the service was poor and the food was good. Now that it has been open a while and I have been there a few times I can say that the service and food are both good, neither is exceptional but both are very acceptable.  The restaurant is clean location is good and the price is what you expect at a nice casual restaurant in uptown. I usually get the grilled chicken tenders with very s sauces. This dish is pretty easy to make and they have delivered a good product each time, the sauces are fine although not different enough to make them interesting. The side salad portion is large for a side salad and the salad ingredients are fresh. Have not tried any of their phone beers but I do see that they have a seasonal collection . I will note that the grilled chicken tenders are probably not grill they are probably done on a flat top otherwise there is no reason for them to be greasy but I can usually plot of the excess greece with a napkin . I have had the fish tacos a couple of times also and would recommend those if you are looking for something on the lighter side."}
{"text":"Average food, good service. really what you would expect from a bar with a slightly upscale feel. The vegetarian hamburger is good but comes with the soggy fries. The mixed vegetables were mostly green beans and they were cooked pretty well, you could tell it was not canned. The salad I ordered the smallest saddest shrimp that you would not expect to see at sit down restaurant.  Ranch dip is so thick, thicker than mayo, not appetizing.  I would go back, keeping my expectations low to moderate.  Probably a good place to watch a game."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have gone to this restaurant on a busy game weekend and had a great experience! Once seated we waited about 15 minutes for a server to come over and when he did, it changed our whole mood on having to wait.  His name is Steven, I would highly recommend asking for him to be your server! He diffused our frustration by telling us why it took him a little while to come over to our table, the person working that section had called off and other servers had to pick up the additional tables at an extremely busy time. Well, Steven did it with a very professional and friendly attitude!!! He so fun and definitely added to our experience!  Food was good too, for \"bar\" food you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant in the Waverly Development. They have a decent draft beer menu and beer prices are reasonable for the area. Food prices were appropriate. The atmosphere is that of a sports bar with TVs throughout the restaurant and bar area. If you are looking for a place to grab a quick meal and a beverage this is it, don't come if you are looking for a quiet meal, as it is pretty loud inside.  There is a small patio for outdoor dining during nice weather. 
   I came at a Friday during lunch, I was supposed to meet a friend but she had something come up, so it ended up just being my toddler and I.  I ordered a Fried Chicken Club Sandwich. The food came out quickly and was tasty. The french fries are delicious.
    I would have given 4 stars as the food was good and didn't take long to be served. However, service what I would expect, especially at a new restaurant.  My order was taken quickly, however my check was delivered barely 3 bites into my meal. Maybe this is how they move people through during the lunch hour but it made me feel like I was being rushed out (despite being told \"no  rush\").  Our table was completely cleared before my son was even done eating his lunch."}
{"text":"So much better than my first visit!  Had the asian grilled chicken salad. Most importantly my server (Desiree) was fast, courteous, and cheerful. The salad was huge, and tasty.  The chicken was served on a skewer and was cooked but tender.  Served with crisp onions on the top.  I was pleased.  Mostly with the service!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Sunday on memorial day weekend and it is packed but management, John said his manager mark, will not allow more tables set because they don't have the kitchen staffed. See the pics"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! The service is impeccable.  The food is delicious!  The atmosphere is warm and inviting!  Prices are very good for what you get! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Got the philly cheesesteak which was huge. Ordered to go and Was with a friend who ordered a burger which they messed up on. But my ohilly cheesesteak was on point. Fries was enough. Sandwhich woulda been dry if i hadnt asked for mayo. Also had some fried pickles which werent too great after 20 mins. Overall service was ok. They always get to go orders wrong and it was only a thursday night. Wasnt too packed. The bartender said sometimes she thinks her cooks cant read . Hmph so much for team spirit!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow service, and less than mediocre food.  Also, server knew absolutely nothing about beer."}
{"text":"Carolina Ale House is actually the first place I ever ate in uptown Charlotte. I was in town for an interview and we had no clue where we were or where to eat. I didn't have a smart phone yet, can you believe that?! So we ended up here. Though it brings back pleasant memories and definitely serves a purpose, as a food lover I don't go out of my way to eat here. The food is decent, I don't have anything bad to say about it, and the beer selection is large but overall this is just your average sports bar food. There are a ton of tv's and service at the bar is excellent so if you're looking for a spot to watch the game and aren't overly concerned about top-notch food then this place is just that. 

We ended up there again because we were meeting a group who was in town for the Panther's game for a late dinner and looking for something convenient (that served plenty of beer) within a short walk from their hotel. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and drinks and the service really was excellent. We started with the appetizer platter, fricles (fried pickles), and sweet potato fries. I had the buffalo shrimp salad, and again not bad but not that good either. 

If your goals are beer and a lot of tv's then this spot will be for you."}
{"text":"Although the wait was long it was a beautiful atmosphere and time passed quickly. We had several appetizers along with various entrees and everyone said it was very good. Felt the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"It was a very good lunch for the four of us. We met another couple for lunch and conversation and were warmly greeted at the door and shown to the table. Our server quickly took drink orders and came back a couple of times to check on taking our food order. We placed that and the food arrived in about 10-15 minutes. 

Two in our party ordered salads, and they were each a nice mix of darker greens with all the advertised toppings. Calorie counts are on each menu item to assist in ordering-some of the dressings I'd have thought would be lower-cal were actually the highest, so that comes in handy!

I got the Greek chicken pita - it was served warm and came with tender slices of chicken (except for one bite, but hey no one is perfect), flavorful feta, and a good serving of all the veggies. Our final diner had a burger, which was HUGE and juicy.

Our server checked back in with us regularly as we continued to chat, and never rushed us to finish or leave, as we did linger quite a while over conversation. All in all a very good experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always really good. I eat here a couple times a month and am never disappointed. Yeah, I've had a couple of bad waiters/waitresses, it happens anywhere you go, but over all nine times out of ten, it's been a good experience. The food comes out good and the prices are what you would expect."}
{"text":"Standard sports pub, with good fried food and lots of different kinds of cold beer, including multiple local microbrew beers. 

Unfried food is meh - our Carolina Cue sandwich seemed to lack the vinegary tang of any barbecue sauce. It was served on a cold grilled bun. I'm not sure how that happened, but -- I was hungry so I ate most of it, even though I'd give it 1 star by itself. 

Service was friendly if not very efficient - I never saw my server until he brought the bill. Two other waitresses seemed to \"catch\" me. Not sure where Steven was, but at least he seemed to care about my experience, even if he was not part of it. 1 star. 

The place itself is bright and busy, with plenty of TVs with a great selection of channels and sports. 3 stars since this is what I expect from a sports pub. 

2 meh stars

2 Dec 2017: As y'all can see, I got the automatic canned response to bad reviews from Carolina Ale House, we will see what they do to \"make this right\" Stay tuned.

11 Dec 2017: I have been communicating with Tyler, who had offered gift cards for a future visit. I have accepted -- FYI and stay tuned ...."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this establishment ever again.  Purpose of going was to watch the Stanley Cup Playoffs, Pittsburgh versus Philadelphia.  Asked multiple times to change get the TVs. Afyer asking for the fifth timeI had to raise my voice to get the TV changed.  The place wasn't even busy. All awhile the big screen TV had a soap opera on it that wouldn't be changed. Your a sports bar!  Poor customer service and the food was over cooked. I honestly can't even give it one star however it was mandatory."}
{"text":"Good place for beers. They have a good broad selection & nice big patio which is great when it's nice out. Inside can get crowded & food I have had was fine, but not special."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the hostess had the personality of the bench that the panthers sat on last night. Awful

Second, it was kind of crowded (not too bad though) when we got there but service was so slow. Then, it got SUPER crowded. We went outside because there was no air Circulation inside. We literally sat there for 25 mins and asked a server to help us and she said, \"oh who's helping you?  Because it's not me.. let me get someone\" like, wtf kind of service is that? 

We convinced a lady to serve us finally and she was sweet, but very slow. It took 47 minutes for her to come tell us the keg was gone for the beer we wanted... oh... ok.

The ONLY reason I gave this place 4 stars is because the brand manager (or branch, I can't remember what she said) Dana was standing next to us and I complained not knowing who she was and she literally took care of our entire tap. And magically got the keg replaced for the beer we wanted. It's amazing how that happened 

Anyways, service stinks but management seems to want to make everyone happy. AND she was Eagles fan. Win all the way around 

#flyeaglesfly"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, the food was great and the service was awesome.  However for the past year it seems like a revolving door of management and staff.  The food is decent now, but the service is so slow, even when they only have a few tables for lunch it still takes way over an hour to get in and out.  I have noticed lately the only time they are busy at lunch is when there is a convention in town.  It's a shame this used to be great."}
{"text":"Fun place and good food! Great selection of beer on draft and good apps! We had the spinach and artichoke dip, buffalo chicken sandwich and buffalo chicken wrap - all were good."}
{"text":"Where do the bankers and other men in button up shirts go after work? Here. Where do the women go? I have no idea, because the ration of men to women was 10:1. Big happy hour place in Uptown, full of testosterone. The bar has tons of beers, and the bartenders are helpful. In fact, they charged my friend and I for two drinks when we had four. When we did the right thing and informed them of it, then waved it off, as if it would be a bigger pain to have to fix it. Hehehe, nice. CAH is a chain in NC, and it serves bar food. This particular site has TONS of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Second time here in 12 years...still not impressed. Food is very mediocre but the drinks are always good. It's a good place to grab something quick and light. Nothing to really delight the palette or have angels dancing on your tongue. But if it's a quickie with friends for a beer, cocktail and wings then go. The atmosphere is mixed so that's always a plus"}
{"text":"Came here twice while staying next door at the Aloft and had two great experiences. Fantastic beer list, including beers from way back home in Michigan. One night I had their dry-rub chicken wings and they were very, very good. Second night I had the Pub burger and it was pretty much perfect in every element-- Burger, bun, toppings, preparation. Top this off with extremely friendly service from the bartender Loreal and it was time and money well spent for me."}
{"text":"Generally not very good. Took a while for food, and when it finally showed up, one of the burgers was raw AND cold! Ack! Not only gross, but a health hazard! They forgot silverware and gave us near-empty ketchup bottles, and when they brought the tab, it was for the wrong table. They seemed genuinely UNinterested, and didn't even say sorry. Wouldn't plan on returning - way too many other interesting places to go in Uptown."}
{"text":"Normally going to a Carolina ale house is a cool place to get good beer and good food, but sadly went to this new location. There weren't a lot of people in the restaurant so the wait time wasn't too bad. The service was decent but the kitchen took over an hour to have our food out. Eventually we spoke to the manager who comped some of our food. I ordered the chicken tacos and they came out cold. There needs to be some management discussions taking place so this doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sit by a window to see the gorgeous city. Fast service & casual atmosphere just like Charlotte's culture.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I might have had it coming ordering fish tacos at a pub but I must say that CAH leaves much to be desired. 

The fries were great at the atmosphere was ok for a pub but the less than great service and slightly sub par food leaves me wishing we had went down the road to Jim N Nicks.

The prices were priced great, making this a nice stop for a drink and appetizer before catching a movie at Concord Mills. I wouldn't go out of the way to come back though."}
{"text":"It's a busy joint especially on any sports night so be prepared for it. Killer appetizers are the Nachos with Pulled Pork, The Sliders, Sweet Potato Fries.

The BBQ Wings are the star for sure.  Good deserts are the cheesecake and apple cinnamon pie in a cup.

Plenty of beers to choose from.  Try the pilot samplers for an introduction if not sure."}
{"text":"We really enjoy eating at this location. The food is typical American food fair: burgers, fries, wraps, etc. 

Everything we get is usually tasty and you can tell that the kitchen staff really knows what they are doing. 

The last time we went we were a little disappointed though. The flow in the restaurant seemed off and our waitress seemed to be handling more tables than most of the others there. When we came in we did hear the hostesses debate with the manager about whether they should seat another table in our waitress' section and the manager insisted on it.

I could see the kitchen from our booth and could see our food come out. It sat in the window for awhile. The manager at the back did not tell our waitress the food had come out even though she went back there a few times. 

So overall good food, but the management seems to lack the ability to ensure that the staff has the proper support to ensure this food is served properly."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. From the host Jordan who was super sweet and made an effort to get to know us as we were from out of town to Champaign our waitress who was super sweet, attentive, and just awesome. The beers were excellent awesome selection.  Food was good too. Only complaint is the mix drinks were just not very good small selection go there for the beer. But much nicer staff than Bubbles."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Bad night at this place.  Sat at bar.  A mess.  Previous party had left and it hadn't been cleaned up. Bar tender eventually slid mess off to side.  No greeting. No \"I'll be right with you\".  After another 5 minutes of being invisible got up and walked out.  Said to hostess on way out \"that was really bad\"."}
{"text":"TL;DR: If I could give 0 stars, I would, *Beers are hooked up wrong*, it takes way too long to get simple pub food, pub food is served on disposable trays, you're better off going to Chili's.

If you're looking for either beer or food and you're in Uptown, don't go here. Literally every other place in Uptown is probably better for food AND service. Or better yet, drive to a Chili's or some other casual service restaurant outside of Uptown, do the 2 for 20 deal, and save yourself some pain. The only reason why my boyfriend and I went here was because we had just toured his office and CAH was pretty close, so we decided to try. I went on Sunday 8/14 around 5pm, and it was almost empty and there were plenty of servers milling around the back. Yet what should've been at most 45 minutes to an hour meal was stretched to two hours because of a bad comedy of errors. And I mean bad. 

The fastest thing for us was getting our orders from our server, who seemed listless and didn't really care about our table. Not once did she ask about our food (which was crap, see below) and getting anything was a slow affair. My boyfriend and I ordered two beers from the tap. My boyfriend's choice wasn't available because there was too much foam coming out from the tap, which happens. However, my choice of beer (a sour ale) was completely wrong -- it tasted like an IPA, and when I asked the server about it, she didn't know what to do, so I talked to the bartender who said that they might've hooked up the kegs wrong. Really? I should've known from that one statement that we should've just left, but we stayed. My second choice wasn't available either (hooked up wrong too) so they comped my beer and I finally got one that tasted like the description on the menu.

However, the food was completely crappy (by this time I'm pretty sure we waited 40 minutes for food.) I ordered a chicken tenders plate and it came on a disposable tray, without the honey mustard or the coleslaw. I don't mind not having coleslaw, but the mustard was needed and I had to ask the server for it. Plus did I tell you it came on a disposable tray (see picture)? My boyfriend's burger was made wrong (he got the pimento cheese burger instead of the pub burger) but he ate it anyway, as we couldn't find our server again to get this corrected. The chicken tenders were over cooked and dry but the fries were okay.

Then it took another 30 minutes to get the check and the beer comped because apparently the server couldn't find a manager to get it off the check. Not only that, I saw a proper plate of chicken tenders come past us :/

Yeah, don't go here."}
{"text":"I have came here several times (dinner and late nights), which I have been waiting to write my review hoping it would get better.  The wings (fried and grilled) is really good! The service is the reason for the 3 star.  It is not the waiters or waitresses.  It just seem they need to iron out some kinks, this location is still new. On my very first visit, we ordered pretzels for an appetizer and the entrees arrived first. We never got the pretzels. On my last visit, we received our fries prior to our wings. It's very small things that can be fixed. We will still continue to come, especially for beers and wings (very reasonable priced)."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch today.  I was hesitant because the yelp reviews are not great so far.  With that said, we had a fantastic experience.  The restaurant is clean and atmosphere is fun, but loud.  Lots of TVs. Sara was our waitress, very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. She happily made recommendations when asked and was familiar with the food and beverage options. I have food allergies which Sara was happy to discuss me.  She communicated my allergies with the kitchen and the kitchen was able to accommodate.  The food arrived in a reasonable time frame and was delicious.  We had salads, zingers and my husband had the pimento cheese burger.  All items we would order again. The managers stopped in to check on our food and service experience, asking for our opinions. We plan to go back tomorrow night with friends!"}
{"text":"We've been to this Carolina Ale House 5 or 6 times.  Our standard order is salad and wings.

I spent more years in Buffalo than I care to admit, and I know that Buffalo chicken wings are NOT breaded.  CAH wings seem to get more heavily breaded each time we go.

Their salads are seriously over-priced.  Lettuce, cucumber, tomato, a little cheese and croutons runs upwards of 7 dollars, almost as much as a hamburger.

So tonight we ordered salad and wings, and asked that we get our salads first.  So you can guess which item came out first - the wings.

We sent them back and I knew what was coming.  Our salads came out 10 minutes later and 10 minutes after that, our wings came out, obviously the same wings that had been delivered 20 minutes earlier, sitting under a heatlamp the whole time.  Breaded wings DO NOT fare well under a heatlamp.

Two salads, wings and two beers + tip = 60 dollars.  Way overpriced."}
{"text":"Face it folks. Read all the majority of negative reviews and know that this place DOES NOT care about the food, your experience, the service. As long as the place is packed on Saturday nights, they could not care less. They are only interested in one thing...taking your money.The food and service will never improve - it's not their objective. So accept it for what it is, a money mill. And when the money stops, the place will shut down like all the ale houses. Get it?!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit. First visit I had a grilled chicken salad at lunch. Good sized portion and good salad. This visit I tried the buffalo wings and fries. The wings were coated with a battered crust that was over cooked and lightly covered with buffalo sauce. I had to send the wings back and opted to not get another order because the first batch was so bad. The beer battered French fries were average. I like the location but the food leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Kind of hit or miss.  The food is okay, not great.  The biggest problem I have is with the wait staff.  Yesterday our server smelled so much like smoke it kind of ruined the meal.  The topper was as she walked from the table she picked her teeth with her fingers.  The host had to wipe the table down before we were seated.  That being said, the server at the next table was attentive and efficient for the gentlemen sitting next to us.  We are going to give it another shot and hopefully they can execute a bit better."}
{"text":"I am rewriting a review on here to compliment the gm ... Brenda. I am only complimenting her because she went above and beyond to make sure that I understood how sorry she was for what happened. This is an establishment that takes care of their clients. I will update when I try the food but the drinks are amazing. 

Best -"}
{"text":"I went here looking for late night grub on New Years Eve 2015 I didn't expect much being that this was a bar but I was totally surprised the food was delicious I ordered this fried fish tacos with a side of sweet potatoes fries which was excellent and perfectly portioned . On top of that my server was awesome ! He was kind and you could tell he liked his job it doesn't get better than that!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for refreshments after a Saturday afternoon walking around downtown Charlotte. We sat outside and enjoyed the nice September weather. They have a separate beer menu with several pages of offerings. The beers are grouped according to style and have brief descriptions of the brews and their brewers. I enjoyed one of their local selections. The service was friendly, helpful, and efficient. This appeared to be a popular place; there was plenty of activity in the bar and restaurant inside. Various football games were playing on their numerous TVs. I certainly would go back for when thirsty for a beer and would like to try some their food."}
{"text":"Great food, expansive beer selection, and a full bar. Everything is made on site from scratch and you can taste it, nothing is frozen or tasteless. Good selection on the menu and a great place to go with a group because they have a little bit of everything. Great patio area but not completely exposed so it can still be used during off weather. Tons of tv's plus pool and corn hole."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Carolina Ale House. It has been amazing. We started with the nachos, they were on point. Best we have had. My husband got the habanero bbq wings and they were amazing! I got the Caroline dip, the sandwich was delicious! Ordered a few drinks thay were tasty as well. Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  Overall a great experience. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The cheese curds were ok but the beer selection saved this rating and so did Loreal! Loreal is the Bar Tender and she was very polite and knew her beers! The Blue Moon First Peach Ale was very good!"}
{"text":"Is it growing pains or should you know what the hell youre doing if you open a franchise restaurant??
Beer selection is on point. But for simple bar food why is the kitchen so messed up. Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Zinger Wrap. Asked for grilled chicken. Came out fried. Ok first week slammed restaurant. They have me a free beer. Cool. Came back tried again...same order. Came back fried and...cold. Another free beer. Anyway. If you want a free beer come here and order the Buffalo Chicken Zinger Wrap grilled. Enjoy your free beer."}
{"text":"Terrible service...  management is the clear issue as it is consistently bad no matter when you go. 

Here is one example

During a night out on the patio drinking I ordered wings with the regular hot sauce. Bartender brings wings out almost 40 minutes later and tells me that they were out of hot sauce and that he gave me spicy Thai??  To provide context on the spectrum of hotness this is 4 levels of hot above the regular hot sauce. Confused, I look at him and say that I would have rather he told me and I would have ordered something else. He then looks at me with no emotion says \"sorry\" and walks away...

Keep in mind I had a $100+ tab ran on drinks with a friend.  I was completely nice the entire night, so clearly I am confused as to what is happening. I refused to pay for them (didn't take a bite) and the manager went on to argue with me..

I will agree with many others that no matter what time or where you sit the service is just flat out terrible. Many residence in the area all say the same thing..  get your act together Carolina Ale House."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. When I interviewed for a job in Charlotte I walked here and liked it so much I returned with my boyfriend after I moved. He liked it too. They have large outdoor seating and the wait staff has always been very friendly. The beer selection is great and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Despite a half empty restaurant with lots of dirty tables and a dirty floor, we were told a 20-30 minute wait. Ordered a beer at the bar and they were out of our selection. We looked really out of place standing by all the empty tables, so finally the manager asked us what we were waiting on and we told him \"a table\". Our sever was pleasant but not at all personable. We waited another 40 minutes for our food to arrive. No apology from the server, but the  kitchen was clearly backed up. We received two mediocre entrees and one cold entree. A side salad ordered with \"no cheese\", arrived with cheese. I ordered the buffalo shrimp salad and the shrimp were ice cold and soggy. I sent it back and it was replaced without an apology from the manager who dropped it off. Everyone else had finished their meals by now and yet no effort was made to apologize or accommodate. It should have been comped from our tab after an hour of waiting for salad.  The whole experience was disappointing. The restaurant is very poorly run. Service is slow and impersonal. I seriously doubt we will go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Nothing says relaxation after a grueling practical like an $8 pitcher of beer. More specifically, a pitcher of the Lonerider Shotgun Betty, a Carolina Hefeweizen that was sweetened with banana and cloves. Can't say for sure whether my palate was able to distinguish such subtle tones, but my liver wasn't complainin'! 

My table ordered three of their signature \"Pub Burgers\", which comes with bacon and onion strings, but it took over 30 minutes to arrive. (We hypothesized that they were cutting the meat right off the cow for our burgers to be made.) They were decent tasting burgers, but it didn't blow me away. Carolina Ale House (CAH) is a great place to chill while watching the NFL ticket, but gourmands should really go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food: 
-  Pub Burger: My burger was piled high with fried onion strings, American cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. The patty was slightly overcooked for my liking but it was edible. It was an average tasting burger. Not bad but nothing to rave about. The fries were tasty. 3.5/5

Service: We were seated immediately and our server was friendly. He split our bill individually without a fuss. 4/5

Final thoughts: I would come back here. The food was decent and it's a pretty chill place to hang out. I was here to de-stress after the NBEO. They have wide selections of drinks to choose from, I defaulted on my usual Heineken Light. A couple of those did the work."}
{"text":"They were out of mashed potatoes and out of gravy.  We were starving, and it took forever to get our food.  My friend ordered the sirloin steak well done with a side salad and vegetables.  I ordered the pub burger.  When the food finally came out, the $15.95 sirloin steak was so small.  The side vegetables was 6 yes count them 6 green beans.  The plate was small, but the food was so small, it left a lot of white plate empty!  The steak was undercooked and slightly red, but my friend scarfed down as much as he could because he was starved.  He left the 6 green beans untouched and ate most of the pink steak and left a portion of the steak that was bloody cold and completely raw!  My burger was good but not worth $9.95.  I've never seen a smaller order of French fries in an Ale house.  I ate my food in under 2 minutes.  My unsweetened tea was watered down to the point it tasted like and looked like water!  I had to wait forever to get a new tea!  I know it was Friday night and busy, but saying \"our kitchen is so busy\" is not an excuse.  As a business, you know Friday nights are busy and should be prepared for it.  To argue otherwise, is to say you don't know your own business!  Between begging for tea, I also had to flag down other servers and beg for Sweetener!  We ordered 6 wings while we were eating our tiny meals cause we knew we would still be hungry.  They took forever to come from the kitchen. The wings were good, but for a $40 check, what a waste of time and money!  I feel like I was robbed!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical chain sports bar. Cheesy stuff on the wall, lots of TVs, big bar. But, a lot of good local beers on tap which definitely puts it in the plus list.

I actually just wanted Bojangles but apparently that closed at 7, so I landed here because it was the emptiest of places on a Friday night (hint). Service was ok, I was greeted right away by the bartender, but the host stand had about 6 people at it, none of who acknowledged people walking in, they were crowded around their phones.

I got the buffalo chicken sandwich, it was pretty good, right amount of heat and a decent size breast. The fries were meh, mostly soggy and very few of them. I think they were getting ready to close or something (this was about 9pm), everyone seemed to be doing their side work and trying to close up. Beer was decently priced though. I ate and left, felt no pull to stick around for a second beer."}
{"text":"Here on a Sunday and place is packed during panthers game. 1 bartender to tend to the 136 people in this joint is ridiculous. Never was asked during my stay if I would like to order food. Look around the bar attest to that as there is no food with 42 drinkers. It would s a great place to drink and watch your favorite team but don't expect any FOOD!! Saw several drinks getting returned due to lack of bartender making a decent drink. Staff looks miserable and the cooks look bored.  Getting ready to leave and in 2 hrs never asked if I wanted food.  Under staffed and poorly managed."}
{"text":"Best place for craft beer in the greater Charlotte Area from my experience! I had a quirky server, Jessica, she was awesome, definitely made us laugh and enjoy our experience.The atmosphere isn't like an ordinary bar, there's high ceilings and an upstairs with pool tables and game machines. Definitely a must on a weekday afternoon!"}
{"text":"Had a graduation party for our daughter, and even though the food was not correct they made it more than right! They also provided good service with a friendly attitudes. Our servers were great as was management! Only bad service was from the bartender whom apparently was having a bad day, and passed that attitude around! But only went to the bar once and then just let our servers deal with her!  Hope they make our server Chris a bartender, great attitude and a great dude! Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"Meh..... Typical generic sports bar. Not thing special. At least the beer list has craft beer."}
{"text":"Painfully slow service.  Went in at 6:41 on a Sunday. We were seated immediately.  The restaurant was t at capacity by any stretch. We waited an hour for our food. Once it did arrive it was good.  But an hour wait is ridiculous"}
{"text":"The burger was delicious, although the \"carmelized\" onions were just quickly sauteed. I asked for mayo on the side, didn't come with the sandwich, and I was told they would go get it. Never arrived. It was nice to sit outside and have some cold beers, but the service was a bit scattered and forgetful. I'd go back to sit outside for a beer and burger again with friends though, on a nice day."}
{"text":"Love it. Food till 2:00am and Angela is an amazing bartender & server. My steak was very good and they have ane awesome beer collection."}
{"text":"We eat here often mainly due to the location, comfortable atmosphere, beer selection and the pool tables. It's a good place to bring a big group or just my family of four.  The food is average fine.  No better than anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went to Carolina Ale House with a group of friends on a busy Saturday night in mid-November. The downstairs was crowded, with several people scrambling for standing room in the bar area to watch college football, basketball and hockey. 

After a short wait, we were led to the desolate upstairs seating area, which included a full (closed) bar and a rarely used pool table. Several customers in need of a drink approached the upstairs bar to avoid the crowded bar downstairs, only to be denied service. Many times I saw these potential customers walk right out of the door to other establishments.

Management is the main problem here. Carolina Ale House needs to re-assess its interpretation of hospitality and re-educate this particular crew of managers. 

I'm certain that the Moshakos family did not intend for their restaurant concept to be a half-used space in the busy entertainment district of Uptown Charlotte. This place won't be in business for long if they continue to let revenue slip away in situations like this.

I won't be going back until the ratings tick up a bit."}
{"text":"Went to Carolina Ale House (CAH, as they call themselves on their menu) for lunch in a party of 9. The place was busy, as has been the case of 2 other times I have been there. The joint serves beer and pub food with lots of TVs, great place to view games. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is what you pay and go for, not the food.

I had the special, a Greek Chicken Pita. Sounds pretty good right, chicken, feta, olives, etc? The problem is that it wasn't made with care, as the pita came soggy with olive juice dripping through the bottom, as if emptied from a can. Worse, there was an olive pit in the pita, which I bit down on, OUCH. Apparently there was a warning somewhere about olive pits... my question, why serve something with pits that can't be easily distinguishable? Great... you put a warning, can I warn you that I may not pay you if I don't like the food and walk out?

The fries are flavourful, but it looked like they were rushed. Straight out of the frier and onto our plates... fresh is good, but usually you want to run the fries through paper towels or something to get rid of the excess grease. CAH fries apparently come with an extra serving of oil on the outside, glistening!

Other folks had the veggie pizza, a grilled chicken salad, buffalo chicken burger, and the fried fish. I think I probably got the worst of it, the other food looked like standard pub food. I had the buffalo chicken burger before and I would rate it three stars. To be honest, if CAH cooks spent 1 extra minute per plate to actually clean up the presentation, that would earn them 1 extra star. KISS, Keep It Simple & Stupid. Nobody walks into CAH expecting miracle food, charge me $10, make me a good burger. Chicken pita would've been fine and good, why add olives and turn it to disaster, honestly, just stupid.

Will I go back, probably once in a bit, but their pricing makes it a rare sports event occasion  or an occasional group lunch. Maybe when March Madness rolls around, we will spend some time there for happy hour / game watching."}
{"text":"I live across the street from here and decided to try it.
The atmospher was really upbeat. It remembers me of a sportbar that has good customer service. 
I got a burger medium wel..It was well down and dry but that is my fault for accepting it. The Fries were really good and my friend order the Buffalo Wings which were AWEsome. I will go back for the wings and fries. I looked around to see what other were ordering and there food looked good as well."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with family out her and had great service from Ebony and Brandon! 

We were waiting for two more to join and Ebony was very patient with us even though the rest of our party joined us 20-30 mins after we were seated (lol). I got the popcorn chicken as we were waiting. The popcorn chicken was very good! Think chick Fil a nuggets but fresher. The chicken was quality. 

For the main course, I got the pub burger and my husband got the buffalo wings fried. We split our orders with each other. The pub burger was great! Loved the fried onions on the burger. I also enjoyed the buffalo wings. Always a great choice. 

Lastly, my father in law is quite boisterous. He likes to make a lot of jokes but Brandon and Ebony hung in there with him. Thanks so much for the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for apps and drinks on a Saturday, late afternoon (4pmish) and was surprised at the amount of people in the joint, not to mention the line out the door by the time we left around 6ish.  Lots of TV's filled with a variety of viewing choices, mostly sports as they are a sports bar kinda place.  Well decorated as you could tell they were trying for the \"local sports bar\" feel, keyword try still felt like a chain sports bar housed in a warehouse.  Sidenote--i think they are owned by a larger chain or restaurant group recently in NJ went to a Miller's Ale House and swear I remember the font styles, decor, and even menu being almost exactly the same.  
  Service was OK.  Like I said it was busy so wait staff was flying around, they weren't great but they all at least appeared to be trying which is at least worth praise.  Food was, and I think I even said this in my Millers Ale house review, well prepared frozen packaged foods.  Decent wing sauce flavors, good menu variety, nothing we had was awful, but nothing jumped out saying Damn that's fresh, or anything life changing.  Prices were consistent for what it is, most items in 10$ and a little higher nothing on the menu will break the bank.
Most importantly, THE BEER!  while the selection was large I'm not sure it was all that impressive.  40+ taps and I think I only saw about 8-10 max worth having.  For a place called CAROLINA ALE HOUSE and the current explosion of NC beer availability would hope for a little more representation in this aspect, but I think maybe I'm just being picky here.   Still a wide variety and for the target demo they nailed it(20-30 taps of abINBEV, MillerCoors products) and prices were again consistent for this type of place avg 4.50-5$ for craft pint.  They did have daily specials I think that day they had 3.5 LoneRider pints or like a $3.25 20oz bud light, I think?  Not to shabby for a pint of sweet Josie or Shotgun Beatty.  
All in all I wouldn't be opposed to going back, I have been to the Greenville SC location multiple times, more inclined to stop by with fam whilst at concord mills or just in the area, probably never going to say \"I have got to drive all the way to that side of town and get some Ale House!\". 
Take it for what it is in the crowded Sports Bar market."}
{"text":"Not a good place to come during lunch hour cause they get pretty busy. Our waitress was not friendly and never checked on us. We asked for ketchup and the bottle was practically empty. Don't get me wrong the food was good especially the Pub burger but the service is horrible!"}
{"text":"We were pretty excited to try this location.  From the outside it looked like a cool, inviting place.  It was as if we were bothering the staff by being there.  Several beers that were on the menu were out because of the \"busy\" weekend.  We were greeted with \"Need menus?\" and the unprofessionalism of staff was embarrassing.  I advise you to not get the chicken nachos either.  The meat was disgusting looking and it came out as soon as the order was placed as if it was just sitting there in the kitchen. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have not eaten any food at this location. This review is for the drink selection and atmosphere. 

I came to this location to celebrate a weekend night off with co-workers and I have to say for drinks and ambiance, the place was perfect. The bartenders were extremely friendly and knowledge on their cocktail selection. The restaurant has a large bar located directly in the center which seats around ~30 people and have plenty of TVs all within line of sight. The draft beer selection was impressive with many of the beers being from local breweries. Heads up: the restaurant does get crowded on weekend nights with waits +45 minutes so be sure to arrive earlier to get a spot. 

Overall, if your looking for somewhere to grab a cold one or a good location to watch sports games this is an ideal place!"}
{"text":"Service has been sub par every time I've come in. I've probably been here 5 to 6 times so it's not a one time occurrence. My last visit: Got sat by the host then waited at least 15 minutes and no one had walked over to greet us. I thought a server would have at least greeted us and taken our drink order, nope. I got tired of waiting and had to get up and go find what looked to be like a manager. He took care of us by getting our drinks and food order but didn't go out of his way to apologize and make up for the lack of service. Only reason I've continued coming back is because the dry rub wings are pretty spectacular and they have a good draught beer selection. If it wasn't for the wings and beer I'd never step foot in this place again. Management and service need to seriously step it up."}
{"text":"I went to the restroom while at CAH. Someone vomited on the door to the men's restroom. No one had bothered to clean it up. I foud out the hard way when my hand touched the door to open it. This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"This place is great the beers cold.. but the bartender mike.. he sucks been stuck like this half the night. Would figure he was here to make money. Evidently not the other poor bartender is running around cleaning and takin orders. Fire mike promote the other lady working. 1/15/18 10:35."}
{"text":"I only come here during the morning shift. Definitely one of my favorite places to come have drinks. Krystal is the greatest bartender i have ever had serve me. Her customer service is spot on and her drinks are amazing. I love how she knows everyone by a first name basis. It's rare to see drive and dedication now a days. I just don't want it to go unnoticed"}
{"text":"Beware this restaurant.  Awful bout of food poisoning this morning from the meat on their nachos last night.  I knew not to eat it after the first bite but went ahead and now paying the price.  Plenty of other options nearby so I would advise not to take the chance."}
{"text":"Return trip yesterday......still a solid place....nothing on menu makes me crazy to return, but solid, good food, and service...."}
{"text":"Okay lets put this in perspective. Yes... parking is a bit rough (you are in freaking downtown)... and this is a sports bar (not a gourmet restaurant). That being said, this place is is pretty amazing.

It is a greatly positioned for those those that work in and around downtown. And those who don't... just take the light rail! 

The place in it of itself is a mecca for sports watching - great tvs at every angle and it is super clean and I have only experienced super friendly service.

The food is bar food... and pretty good bar food at that. I had the chicken tenders and the salads... solid choices... nothing to write home to mom about about solid.

Great drinks selection and they actually have some unique drinks too."}
{"text":"Astonishing in its mediocrity. 
I had chicken with orzo and a couple of margaritas. 
Nice/pleasant/utterly average."}
{"text":"We live really close to Carolina Ale House so were very excited when it opened!  We have been many times.  As a bar- it's a good spot!  As a restaurant.....NO.......

I have now tried a salad, fish and chips, nachos, their sampler platter and the Reuben.  Nothing has been great....I'd rank it along with all other chain bar food.  The Reuben was the worst I've EVER had!  The bread was not grilled, it was cold and just tasted \"off\".  I hardly touched it and the server did not ask why.  She was also MIA for about 5-10 minutes after the food was run which was frustrating because I needed 1,000 dressing to try and revive the sandwich, which was unsuccessful.

If you want a beer head here!  If you want edible food, don't bother."}
{"text":"Most recent visit: tacos showed up with no sauce and no side, see picture for reference 


I am very impressed with the efficiency of this place so soon after opening. I've been here twice, both times for lunch. We've had excellent service and good, warm, timely food both times. I love the new space with the high ceilings and fun decor. The menu is expansive and affordable, and they have amazing drink specials e. My favorite thing being 5 dollar cocktails every day! I'm so excited to have this place to hang out at in waverly, well done!"}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE. My expectations were already set low when a friend warned me that the food she ate had not been that great at the other locations- but I never imagined it could be so bad. Not only did they forget half of our order the first time- but then each entree came out either cold, incorrect or was just completely missing. Even the three times another waiter came by to double check what was missing and they still got it incorrect! Not sure who is at fault for this when you realize your waitress is the only bartender and server upstairs on a Monday night- but then again she didnt write anything down either. A manager thought it would be good customer service to practically beg us to take other food from the kitchen but frankly we had all lost our appetite at that point. There are many sports bars in Charlotte and I'd rather go to one that has good food, great service and they dont charge you for the food that they messed up on or forgot to bring you."}
{"text":"Imagine an Over priced Applebees in the heart of Uptown - with airport quality wait staff."}
{"text":"Great location and very good food! Perfect Friday night out on the town, for a date or meeting a group. Wide variety of beer on tap and creative mixed drinks as well. I would definitely revisit soon!"}
{"text":"I won't waste my time at this place again. Restaurant had a few customers, mostly FSU fans. Waitress was awesome but Manager Amanda refused to turn the sound on the College Football Playoff selection at noon after multiple tables had asked. Manager Amanda was rude and arrogant. When all the customers are wanting the sound to the Playoff selection wouldn't you want to get the customers what they want?"}
{"text":"I come here a lot and honestly it's kinda the same every single time. The managers just kinda stand there bossing everyone around, which I understand you're a boss, but it's also about teamwork. All the servers look like they don't want to work here . Not saying I get horrible service, but the vibe here is kind of bad."}
{"text":"Once a month I coordinate a lunch out for my active adult group at the Fort Mill YMCA. A number of my members had suggested the Carolina ale house and so I contacted Michelle, the sales and special events coordinator. My group likes to have a long table so they can converse and Michelle made that happen. We had a table of 30 people and two waiters that took great care of us. Our orders came out in a timely fashion although there was a bit of a delay for the fish and chips. I had the grilled shrimp salad which had a nice spicy bite and tasty greens. Others in my group had the three sliders and grilled chicken salad with strawberries. All were very happy with their selections and are looking forward to coming to Carolina ale house again!
If you happen to be in the Fort Mill area and want a yummy meal in a nice sports bar atmosphere check out Carolina ale house!"}
{"text":"We came in with friends one night and no one greeted us. After seating ourselves, our waiter Deshai took 15 minutes to serve us, another 25 minutes to bring us our wings. Then told us the kitchen ran out of the flavor we requested. And also ran out of another dish we ordered. So we waited a long time again to eat. 
He never checked on us. 
We had to get another waiter to find him. 
We requested to-go boxes, well he brought them to us and sat it ON TOP of our food! HOW DISGUSTING! 

What an awful experience! 
We understand it's a \"bar\" type of restaurant, and average quality, but it's located uptown and you'd expect adults to have manners!"}
{"text":"We were not a fan. The atmosphere and service was nice but the food wasn't very good. We got the fried pickles and chips/ salsa/ queso. These aren't really items you can mess up on but they tasted sub par."}
{"text":"I loved my visit here.  Parking was awesome.  Easily accessed if you find the correct parking garage.  You walk straight in the building from the deck and it's only a $5 deck which is a bonus.  Too bad they don't validate parking or it would be an even bigger bonus.  Food was great, a little better than typical bar food.  Prices were fair, that goes for food and drinks.  TV's were plenty.  I have to say this is a great place to watch a game or meet friends, just make sure to park in the garage located behind the establishment."}
{"text":"WOW!  What a great alternative to the tired epicentre bars!  I was at this cool spot for happy hour last night (ANY pint $3!!) and it was so fun.  Huge downstairs bar and upstairs seating.  The bar has a Hickory Tavern feel, not pretentious, just a laid-back cozy bar.  We had the calamari (lightly breaded), wing platter (very big, not scrawny) and the fried pickles (everything you would expect!).  

The waiter was constantly checking on us and didnt miss a beat.  Some of us got dinner there, on the higher end of bar food all in all.  The manager stopped by and joked around with us and was very friendly.  

I love that the music isnt too loud here like at Mortimers.  At Mortimers you have to yell to your friends even though they are sitting in front of you, but here the music (all 90's hits last night!) was just loud enough to hear it but not overwhelming.  What a great addition to uptown!  :-D"}
{"text":"I've had lunch and drinks at this location several times since they have been open, and my experience has always been so so- food is average, but good location. Today was horrible. I went for lunch with a few colleagues. 3 of us ordered a bowl chili and it never came out of the kitchen until well after our meals arrived, which brings me to my next issue. Our food (consisting of salads and basic sandwiches) took approx 1 hr to come out of the kitchen and the place wasn't very busy! Our server seemed very frazzled and never gave us any updates unless we asked him to do so. He seemed annoyed that we expected our food to arrive in less than 1 hr. When the food finally did arrive, it was clear that most of it sat for awhile because it was all cold. 3 out of the 6 orders were wrong (way off the mark) and they never fixed the problem, even after asking. 
Needless to say, this was an awful experience and I would not go back."}
{"text":"Nice looking Ale House in Fort Mill. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.  I did pre arrange my gathering with Michelle before arriving and she was fantastic!  Our area was setup, the food came out shortly after we arrived.  I will def come back when in the area for lunch or after work drinks with the team."}
{"text":"My two cousins and I had lunch a few weeks back and our waitress was sub par to say the least. Our food was good and the drink specials were appreciated. However her attitude was impossible I ignore, she seemed distracted and completely disinterested in serving us. It was awkward and we did not know why. After our food arrived she walked by at least 8 times (bussing tables, other customers, etc) and never stopped to see if we needed anything. Instead bringing the check when we seemed to be finished. We decided to talk to the manager as the rudeness was palpable and he said it was her third complaint of the night. He apologized but essentially did nothing more. The least he could have done was ring us out instead of sending her back over to do so, that was extremely uncomfortable for all parties involved."}
{"text":"Had the habanero wings which were great. I ordered the crispy fish tacos which were jot so good. Service was great"}
{"text":"Best place to eat and watch a football game.  Food is amazing and the service was on point.  Will def be going back"}
{"text":"I ate here opening night. The service and food preparation were flawless. We started with the nachos, with chili on the side. The serving was large. We had 3 people in our party. We made it about 80% through. I ordered the pub burger. It came with thin fried onion rings, bacon and a sauce that pulled it all together. Again, large portion in a good way. I also tasted the grilled salmon. It was good quality, prepared just right. I may order that next time. We sat at the outdoor bar, which has a view of the lake. They have a huge selection of beer but you know that. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their buffalo chicken wraps (and wings) have become my favorite. Lots of beer choices for the beer drinkers. Lots of TVs if that's what you like to do while you eat/drink. I've been for lunch during the week while working and also on the weekend when I've had more time to relax and just enjoy the meal. I've never felt rushed, though service has always been prompt.

I've never sat in the upstairs section but they have tons of room on both levels. Waitresses are always very friendly, even when not 'perfect' in their service. I'll be going back again and again..."}
{"text":"Great for drinks but food needs help.

I travel a lot and like to give local restaurants a try.  Most are pleasant and food are good.  I usually do not leave an establishment unhappy but there always a first for everything.  I do understand that it is a very difficult industry to provide good service and great food.

My friends and I entered the restaurant after a long day of visiting clients and were excited about grabbing some food and drinks.  We were quickly seated. We were met by Matt and Erin who was training that day.  They were very attentive.  The bar selection was great. We had some good craft beers.

Now for the food commentary. We ordered the Greek pizza, chicken wings, berry salad, and chicken sandwich. The wings came out first.  They were larger than average size wings but were over fried and glazed with sauce. They look like wings out of a frozen bag.  They were okay at best.   

My Greek pizza looked tasty but when I bit into the pizza it was very bland. I had to ask what kind of meat was on it because it looked like someone scooped a bunch of mystery meat on it. It turned out to be minced chicken, straight out of a can of chicken meant for chicken salad.  They used regular olives instead of Kalamata olives.  The spinach on it seem boiled and then thrown on top.

The berry salad did not look like what was on the picture. It was mostly strawberries topped on a house salad. My friend said it was one of the worst salads he ever had in terms of flavor. The chicken was dry and it was over sauced.  He barely ate half of it.

As for the chicken sandwich, it too was dry. I saw my other friend pick it apart to eat the juicy tender inside.

It's a shame that the food was not good. The restaurant has so much potential. There were plenty of TVs, beers on tap, and the service was good. The environment was lively. It needs help from Gordon Ramsay!!!

3 stars for service, entertainment, and drink selection."}
{"text":"Waverly continues to add more restaurants and shops and as a result, the parking situation is hairy.  Today, I went with Sid, John, Arlene, and Mary to the recently opened Carolina Ale House.   Let me be frank, I am not a fan of sports bars or pub food, but I wanted to at least try this new restaurant.  It is close to my house and close to my spouse's workplace.  So we went. First impression:  cavernous. The place is big and has multiple rooms. A lot of sports paraphernalia flank the walls. It is colorful and bright, despite being cavernous.  I ordered a salad with apple strips and blue cheese crumbles and chicken.   Luckily, I was able to steal some fries off of the plates of the others.  I thought the salad was  exactly what I expected. The fries were really great - nicely salted.   For whatever reason, they were messing with the sound system while we were there.   For a few seconds, the music became so loud that my eardrums about burst.  I went to inform the manager that we could no longer talk with music that loud, but he came to our table and apologized and said that they shouldn't have been messing with the sound system during business hours. So, the music went back to normal.  And then the sound fluctuations started again. Whatever.  All in all, a decent meal and I guess I will concede that Waverly needed a Sports Bar. I wish this place well."}
{"text":"We (my boyfriend and I) are from the Raleigh area and we have tried and enjoyed plenty of Carolina Ale Houses in the area and all have great food, service, and facilities - even the RDU location is great and airport food and service can be atrocious at some places. 

I had to pick him up at CLT after a canceled flight, so we started on our way home around 10pm and wanted to find somewhere open late so we wouldn't feel rushed to eat and get out. I googled places by Concord Mills since it is on the way and when this popped up I didn't check any reviews since all the locations in our area are fantastic. 

We walked in to a sign that just said seat yourself. We picked a booth by the bar since that is where most people were sitting. Our waitress Rianna was over quickly & said she would bring menus. She was very fast and friendly and helpful the entire night. Had she been in charge of everything, this would probably be five stars. 

I ordered a raspberry lemon (maybe lemon) sangria and bf ordered a beer and she went ahead and took our food order. My sangria was pretty good - it had raspberries and a lemon in the drink and looked like a strawberry caprioska to me which I love. Rianna even pointed out that a stray piece of mint was in my drink and offered to get me a new one but I was good. I ordered the pimento and bacon cheeseburger with slaw and bf ordered the turkey wrap with slaw. 

Our food came out pretty quickly and bf noticed he had fries instead of cole slaw which wasn't huge because we ended up sharing my slaw and his fries anyway. He said his turkey wrap was pretty dry and basically the same as a turkey wrap you might buy at a Sheetz. My burger I ordered well done. I don't like pink in my burger. When I bit into it, it was completely burned. I mean most of the burger was charred but the very center of it seemed to be done the way the outside of the patty should have been done. I tried to like it because the toppings seemed good, but I couldn't eat more than half. I know people usually send stuff back, but we always hate complaining and wanted to get on the road sometime soon too. So we ate fries and slaw and each ate about half our entrees. 

I ordered another drink sometime while our entrees were there but when this one came out it looked and tasted completely different. This was just a dark pink drink wth no sort of fruit inside it. I just didn't ask at this point. Our waitress was still friendly and quick even though the place was sort of busy so I didn't want her to have to figure out my drink mystery. 

Also - the place just seemed pretty dirty. I've never seen that at one of these restaurants. When we came in we had to pass over several booths that still had dishes everywhere. The nastiest part was the bathrooms. The women's bathroom smelled horrible and was just filthy and my bf said the men's bathroom was the same way. 

We won't avoid this chain at all because it is great at all the triangle locations we have tried so we aren't holding one night at one location against the rest of them. But we end up at CLT sometimes driving through and we will definitely avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I were looking for a place to have good food and watch some college football. We went on a Holiday weekend Sunday night. Not much of a crowd inside, should have been a sign that this place was not the right choice. 

Our waiter was attentive and very nice. He remembered our entire order and refilled our beers often.

Food was average. The only thing worth trying for us were the sweet potato fries. I had the California dipper - beef brisket sandwich with dipping juice. Sooooo salty and the brisket was not the best. I don't recommend. The sandwich needed some slaw to counter the high sodium. My fianc√© had the wings and fries. Wings were average. Not the best we've had. But you can request different flavors and the food was a decent price. 

For sports vibe, it's pretty good. If you are looking for a place to get a cold beer and catch a game, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Beer was cold but bar service was awful.  Could not get the bartenders attention to order food.  One I did I ordered French onion soup and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Waited a while then what I expected happened.  The bartender who was not real with it brought out both together.  When I said I wanted the soup first she said \"I did not know\".  I said \"who orders both together\".  Please take it off.  She gave me attitude.  Then guy next to me orders a salad and a meal and she asked \"do you want your salad out first\" he said yes and looked at me and said \"is she kidding?\".  Went to eat the sandwich and fries were cold.  I could not get their attention to get a knife and fork so when I finally did I said \"I will pay for the beer and I am leaving\".  Went to Mortimers and had a completely different experience.  If you are just drinking beer Carolina Ale House is fine but if eating walk past it."}
{"text":"Beer lovers throughout the Carolina's know all about of the Carolina Ale House!  With Nearly 30 locations, this family owned restaurant has made a big splash in the craft beer world.  But what most folks don't know is the Carolina Ale House has an every changing menu of made-from fresh entrees and more that will make your heart swoon.

We stopped in at the Uptown Charlotte location (201 S. College St. #200) to visit with General Manager Brenda Johnson and District Manager Deanna Davis about everything that goes into making the Carolina Ale House such a great family friendly place to visit.  We also wanted to checkout their 72 Beers on Tap and some of their newest culinary creations, including a Grilled Chicken Flatbread, Asian Grilled Shicken salad, and the amazing Chorizo Meatloaf with Bacon Chipotle gravy!

If you are looking for some of the best beer and food pairings with tons of TVs and distractions for the kids, you can't go wrong at any of the 30 Carolina Ale Houses."}
{"text":"Bar/drinks only review

After an amazing Yelp event at CO, some friends and I came here for an after dinner beer. Someone held the door for us and greeted us. Nice start!

At the bar we realized that we had left our nametags on as we were greeted by name - lol - doesn't get any more personal than that!

Lucky for us Wednesday was craft beer night for $4 per pint. Ale House has a very nice selection without being overwhelming - besides the main menu, there's an insert with the rotating local taps that you might miss if you don't know it's there (so now you do). Was pleasantly surprised to see Spoaty Oaty by AMB!

Great bartenders, nice mood lighting and tons of TVs everywhere.

Even though it was a short trip/one round, staff held the door on the way out and wished us a good night. Classy and friendly!"}
{"text":"If you like beer like I do and you are from up north where you get at least 20 draft beers at a time, youre in luck. The specials are hard to beat with so many to choose from. The service is shaky but so are most sports bars. The location is hard to beat especially if you are so tired of the Epicenter, its right across the street!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I got amazing service from Loriael!! She knows the menu and recommended me a great wing flavor to try. Best bartender in uptown!"}
{"text":"I sat down at 8:45 pm and promptly ordered the chorizo meatloaf with a side Caesar salad.  My salad showed up a few minutes later with a message that they have no meatloaf left and I had to choose something else.  Now I have a salad and have to pick another entree.  I went with the fish n chips which ended up a major mistake.  I should have known things weren't right when they literally showed up before I was half done with my salad.  The fish coating was greasy and soggy and the fries were undercooked to the point where they still had a slight crunch to them.  The tarter sauce was basically only mayo.  I tried to scrape off the breading of the fish and just eat the inside but even the fish wasnt good so I ended up giving it back.  

They did end up taking it off my bill after I requested it but I don't recommend this dish.  I also suggest to the restaurant that if you are out of a dish please don't bring part of the meal to me then tell me what I ordered is not available.

Interestingly enough the first review on another site also mentioned a \"disgusting\" experience with the fish n chips."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday at 9:15pm with a party of 7. It's currently been over an hour since the time we ordered and our food still had not come out. Not sure if they are doing any actual cooking in the kitchen or taking Sunday morning confessionals. Waitress told us she had to yell at the cook to stop hitting on women and to start cooking... Absolutely ridiculous. Definitely won't be back. Over an hour for burgers and wings... Not even remotely acceptable."}
{"text":"Great bar and staff! Dry rubs wings are ok... the hot wings with wet sauce are better.
The garic parm wings are average too.

Food 9/10
Service 10/10 - Heather is great!
Parking 5/10
Location 7/10
Music 9/10
TVs 9/10

Love the drinks, the tvs for football and the seating is ample including outside seating."}
{"text":"Food is good. The service is less than stellar. Mostly have had wings and beer here and those are both hard to mess up. I've had a couple very nice and personable servers and a couple that were acting like they were doing me a favor by serving our tables. 
Maybe they should check their wait staff."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with the quality of food and service given the length of time they've been open and how crowded they were at lunch time. I ordered the Picky Platter- buffalo sauce was excellent and the wings were nice and crispy. The sangria was delicious. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because while they were affordably priced, my husbands fish tacos were kind of small and the side item, which was a rice pilaf, did not look appetizing at all."}
{"text":"One of the better places to eat at near Concord Mills. The food is always great and the atmosphere, to me, is enjoyable. With TV's mounted all over the walls and sport memorabilia everywhere it is a neat place to be. The food has and is always good. The fried pickle are amazing, and burgers are delicious as well. Normally entrees come with amazing crispy fries. There are many options to choose from and it's well worth the visit."}
{"text":"They have a ton of TV's and a great craft beer selection so it's an awesome place to watch a game.  The food is pretty bad though...  Everything is fried and heavy, huge portions, makes you hate yourself after leaving there. Even something as simple as wings are no good here...  Stick to a burger if you have to grab a bite. Otherwise they have a very cool outside (but covered) bar area...  The inside is always dark and crowded so we've never sat in there."}
{"text":"It's so odd - we eat there every few months but each time wonder why.  

Seems the blue cheese dressing is just ranch with blue cheese crumbles and extra garlic added.  The wings are puny and inconsistent. Today we ordered 18 and my 8 year old jumped out of the seat and said, \"This isn't 18 wings!\"  Sure enough it was 15. The server (who was great) took the wings and said they'd add 3 and more sauce. She could look at them and see they weren't right. 

I guess we will be back come February and be reminded it's not a place we like well enough to go back sooner."}
{"text":"Beer is good but last time my husband and I came in on a Saturday afternoon, bartenders were horrible. You have to flag them down while they are chatting with their coworkers. They give you your first drink and then they do everything to avoid you after that. Ridiculous. Not sure why it took her 15min to get get two small packs of berries from wherever they keep them. Then she left again to get something else that took another 5min. Poor management. Neither of them smiled - not once. Guess their hourly wage must be good enough to not need tips."}
{"text":"I have visited this location several times and always enjoyed it however tonite was a different story. Casey was our waitress and was amazing we had no issues with her at all. Our issues were from the kitchen. My daughter ordered the kids burgers and what came out looked like less than half a patty on a bun. I complained about the size and Casey took them back to the kitchen. My wife's burger was pink in the center as well which was sent back. 20 minutes later we received my daughters again which looked better but we're now pink in the middle and had to be sent back again. Another 20 minuets and we finally received both  meals which were finally cooked correctly. The manager defiantly made things rite so I'm not complaining to try and receive anything but more to thank Casey for the great service she provided  and let others know that even though your orders take too long and the food isn't rite it's not the waitress fault. they are the face of the restaurant and take a lot of weight on when dealing with these issues. This restaurant needs to make some changes in the kitchen and it surely needs to be managed better. I honestly can't see us returning here for a while in hopes that they will get the kitchen fixed."}
{"text":"Carolina \"themed\" restaurant with values clearly against true \"Carolina or family values, where you are most definitely NOT \"always welcome here.\"

Menu was extremely uninspired.  Beer selections, were very common and unadventurous. 

Waitstaff was overwhelmed with a 1/2 empty place. 


RDU based \"triangle values\" include prohibiting the most law abiding guests in existence, those who have undergone a full background check to carry a concealed weapon.  Does the management have on site security to make up for increasing the vulnerability of those they want the revenue from?  Nope. 
Just a silly sign to push their asinine political preferences on the public. 

All but 4 mass shootings have taken place in a \"Gun Free Zone\" since 1950.  I will not take my family to a Victim Targeting Area.   

I discussed it and asked the general manager and asked about his efforts to make up for their choice to reduce my safety.   I remained calm, which he was unable to do.   

We will NOT be going back!  There are a plethora of options that do not dictate and minimize my family's safety."}
{"text":"We were here for a Yelp event. It is a pretty large bar with lots of TVs. You can get a very large selection of beers here and they have a nice area upstairs which you can book for larger parties. Since the food on the Yelp event ran out, I have ordered a burger and fries. I have a rule that if a place can't cook a good burger and fries, everything else will be bad. This burger wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. It was enough to get my dinner for the night, but it isn't something I would go back just for it. I will be back another time to taste the wings (which people were raving about)."}
{"text":"I came here to try their lunch specials for US$ 5.99. As I arrived I told that I was going to sit at the bar. There were two other customers there. Waitress gave me the menus and asked what I wanted to drink. I looked at the menus (drink and food) and did not find the 5.99 specials. Once the waitress arrived with my drink I asked where were the specials. She grabbed the menu from the bottom shelf and literally threw at me. The menu even made a noise on the table and the other two customers were just shocked by that too. I wasn't rude asking, it was very nicely actually. However, seems like she was looking for a higher tip and perhaps wasn't even showing that menu to customers.

The service was slow too. Food was okay and the taste was just bland. Not a good place to come eat, neither at dinner. Perhaps a place to get a drink and watch sports, but not for anything else beyond that.

Usually sports bars will have nice burgers, sandwiches, etc. Not this one apparently."}
{"text":"Interesting setup here, you are greeted by a hostess inside the door, but there is no hostess stand. Service was slow although I went on a Sunday, lots of dirty table not tended too, waiters were nice but never really came around to check on us, I received refills when I did not want them (did not ask if I wanted r fill just brought it out in a separate glass and did not take the old one. Food: I had the wings, nothing special, a little bland, However despite this it is an awesome place to hang out if u love sports, lots of big TVs"}
{"text":"Newest bar uptown and right off the beaten path of Tryon and Epicenter land.  I was there for an after work function recently and it looked like it was getting a decent crowd so I suspect this place to do pretty well if they can keep the people happy with good service.  Typical bar food fare and also some daily specials that just can't be beat.  For instance, Wednesday is $3.00 pint night....YES PLEASE!  I like it!  

We had a table of about 7-8 people and the server kept up really well considering the amount of ordering going on so kudos for that.  The interiors are a little ho-hum for my taste with typical oak cabinetry and millwork trim.  Nothing wrong with that every once in a while but I tend to lean more towards trendy environments."}
{"text":"So I know that a lot of people on here have given 1 star reviews, but honestly come on...

Is the service the fastest? No. I waited approximately 15 minutes before our server came to the table. But we weren't in so big a rush that I feel the need to rant and complain on here. There is indoor and outdoor dining. They have a pretty decent beer selection. I elected for the HappyYum IPA from Foothills Brewing in Winston Salem that had a good flavor. 

The wings may be a bit overpriced, but for the area and the quality it was not too bad. 

I think the wings are really good and worth trying if you haven't been here, but don't come expecting to be in and out in less than an hour."}
{"text":"Walked out, the hostess was outside bullshiting with one of her friends.  She almost runs me down trying to get to the hostess station while I'm walking in the door.  She proceeds to seat my party.  That's the last we saw if anyone.  We sat there like doofuses for twenty minutes.  We walked out. Inexcusable!  The place was empty!  I'm in town frequently.  I'll never return and advise others to do the same.  Hipster sports bars are a dime a dozen.  Who needs Carolina Ale House?"}
{"text":"I'm from Florida where there is one of the Alehouse chain on every corner, kind of like a Friday's... Good beer selection and nice when you can sit outside... some miserable bartenders sometimes ... it's all good!"}
{"text":"Boo this place!! One ounce pours on shots . It's not the wild wild west anymore it's 2012. Most restaurant/bars Do 1.5 oz pours. Ridiculous tab bc the shots were gone so quickly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while staying at the Hilton.  It's your typical sports bar, lots of tv's with games on everywhere.  But it's big and bright with two story windows and one of the few places rocking on a Sunday in downtown Charlotte a far as I could see.

Service is friendly and efficient.  Beer selection is good with some local brews.  I ordered the buffalo shrimp which was, meh but the cole slaw was awesome and my friend's buffalo wings were maybe the best I've ever had!!! Great smokey flavor!  Loved them.  Really good wings.  Didn't expect this place to have such good wings.  So wished I had ordered the wings."}
{"text":"New to town, new to the bar scene down here. Good location right off the street so I walked in. 

Good beer specials on Tuesdays, and great beer selection. Fun atmosphere for games. 

For dinner, I previously got a regular house salad. I thought it was pretty tasty for a bar salad, and well let's face it, its a salad. This time I chose to get the Pub Burger and that was pretty dang good. A cooked to order patty with onion straws, cheese, and amazing bbq sauce. It's a step above regular bar fare. If you're looking for a chill place just to swing in to get bar food and a good beer, this is the spot."}
{"text":"I was curious why this place had such low marks. We had a party of nine that was quickly accommodated on a busy Sunday night. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I believe her name was Sarah. Splitting the check between 9 people was easy and convenient. 
 Now let's get to the food. I ordered a Pub burger which was actually really good. I could have used some more fried though. My wife had an ah√≠ tuna salad and her fish was ice cold she said. My wife had a lemon drop which she said was just ok and wasn't a full glass. I thought the beer menu lacked depth. Seemed like I could have found those beers anywhere. Would have liked some more unique options. I don't think I would return here considering all of the options in town. Unfortunately there was nothing that made The Carolina Ale house stick out."}
{"text":"What a surprise when I came in tonight for a $3 pint and ran into 11 of my co-workers. I guess this is our new staff bar? No, literally, 11 of them.

I am loving the beer list here, and I am loving the fact that Wednesday is $3 night even more. I enjoyed my fish tacos immensely, and a few other menu items were enjoyed by my coworkers as well. The menu is mostly typical bar food, but as it's served until 2 every night, do you hear me complaining? The staff was extra friendly and kept all of our progressively growing tabs excellently.

The patio is not quite open yet, and probably won't be until the Spring, but man I can't wait until it is. Ale House, you have won me over."}
{"text":"This place is okay. The service is good. The drinks are good . The is okay nothing great. Overall this is a nice sports bar. It is good for a bite. The prices are good."}
{"text":"Called in a order for pick up.  Ordered the Fish tacos.. I do not recommend , very bland , I'm pretty sure one of them had a raw piece, hope i don't get sick.. I order fries instead of rice, she charged me extra, and the fries are cold, no where near fresh, and just terrible and there was a chunk of nasty fried grease in them.. . I should have believed the other yelpers.. won't be going back here .."}
{"text":"Come to town for racing and arrogant bar tender would not turn tv to race channel. All 4 TV's on same station."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with no expectations but that was vastly turned around. The wings were done perfectly and they had a smoked/roasted taste that hit my pallet just right the chicken wrap was good could have used some type of sauce to go along with the cole slaw like an aolie or avocado, however the roasted veggies were absolutely inviting because they were seasoned and had a smoked taste as well great surprise all around."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Service is slow, kids water was brought in glasses with some kind of slime growing in them.  Took ten minutes to get the beers my wife and I ordered.  Wish they were cold...  Overall the restaurant is dirty - Windows, tables, floors, restrooms.  Far better options in the area - save yourself the trouble and head elsewhere."}
{"text":"I nominate this restaurant for the worst restaurant in Fort Mill award. 

The first time I came here we were given dirty dishes and plates multiple times and had to wait over an hour for food.

The second time I came with a friend and after ordering a medium cooked burger he was greeted almost 2 hours later by some homunculus, whomst I assume was the chef, who proceeded to loudly exclaim, \"who ordered the overcooked burger!?\"

The third time I went with friends and it took some of us almost an hour to get beers, and others in our party had already finished eating and were leaving by the time others got their drinks (we all ordered at the same time). 

to add insult to injury the restaurant wasn't remotely busy any of these times.
Do yourselves a favor and buy a six pack and some takeout instead of coming to this atrocious restaurant, nothing of value will be lost. Plus you will save money because this place is also overpriced. sad!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Great place to grab a bite and a beer! Tons of differ t kinds on tap and the zingers are great"}
{"text":"This place is just okay. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great!  Food, however, mediocre. Decent bar food."}
{"text":"I have never had the food but I have been here a few times for drinks.  This seems to be a popular spot with my business colleagues.  

It is a great spot to grab a beer or other adult beverage.  It is a large restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating.  The beer selection is very impressive.  

If you looking for a casual watering hole when in Uptown then I would recommend."}
{"text":"service is slow at times, but food is good ans so is the beer varaiety."}
{"text":"So excited to see this opening in area. Fort Mill has definitely been lacking in restaurants. Have been twice and the first experience was definitely better than the second. Food is average. Nothing to go out of your way for. But good for the price and you basically know what to expect. The service here needs a lot of work. They all seem very overwhelmed & confused. The second time we visited for lunch and opted to sit outside overlooking the pond. We sat for about 15 minutes and no one came over to us despite the fact that a handful of servers and managers walked right past us. Eventually I got up and went and asked a manager (one who had previously walked past us) if someone was going to wait on us. We went ahead and ordered everything at once since we weren't sure if we'd ever see someone again. The poor server doesn't seem to have ever waited tables before and didn't know anything about the menu. Knew nothing about the beers on tap, we had to point to him on the menu which one we wanted, and didn't know anything about the food menu or kids menu. Food took over 30 minutes to come out. Kind of a long time so essentially ready made bar food. Hoping this place can tighten up a little bit!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! This place will double charge you. After eating lunch I asked for the bill. Put my card in the deal and the server took it. The server came back with 2 charge slips for me to sign. One for $39 and the other for $55 stating that she made a mistake and forgot to add 2 items to the bill. Typically the server would make mention of the mistake and present a new tab. Instead this establishment feels that they have the authority to charge what ever they want. I asked for a manager - manager says it was just a mistake and the $39 will go back to your card in a few days. I explained to her that this is not the correct way to do business. She said that she would go ahead and take care of our lunch once I refused to sign anything. Nothing has been credited back or reversed so I had to dispute the charge through my bank. Spread the WORD - don't get scammed at this place"}
{"text":"Beer had food particles in the glasses when I got them and we asked for multiple changes to our food orders. They all were wrong. My salad had all brown lettuce underneath. Definitely wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Fish cooked on one side but not the other. Carrots and tomatoes in my salad were translucent (means they were frozen). I wish I noticed before I put that one nasty tomato slice in my mouth.
Used to be a good place to eat but was gone downhill."}
{"text":"I stopped at the Ale house for a quick beer and a snack. I ordered a blue moon and some chips and salsa. The salsa was good but it was the smallest cup of salsa ever. The chips were good, I thought. My other complaint is the they had like 50 (exaggeration) bartenders behind the bar, however, not once anyone stopped to ask if we needed anything. We had to flag them down and one bartender even told us to \"hang on\" when we finally got his attention. 

Just a typical sports bar. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a couple times to see if it ever gets better. I have to say it doesn't. The service is unbelievably terrible. First, you enter to the most unpleasant, angry hostesses in the Carolinas! Then, you come to the disgusting tables,(both inside and outside). The waitresses and waiters are so arrogant, that it makes the meal so awkward. The food is mediocre, if not terrible. It has been undercooked, underseaoned, and just plain disgusting. I will surely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Made a pit stop here for a beer and to check out a game! TV's everywhere, so there is not a bad spot in the house. The bartender was amusing and knew his shit when it came to football. Good time in an easy going, relaxed bar!"}
{"text":"I've dropped in here a couple of times after working a contract at the BB&T building.  Honestly, the bartenders are friendly, efficient, and intelligent.  I get my usual favorite here: Birdsong's Jalape√±o Ale.  It's a great place to stop in for a quick beverage on your way home after work.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst wings ever! Heard good things about them and they were every bit of unsatisfactory. I ordered a 18 piece 1/2 garlic parm 1/2 buffalo and 2 side orders of sweet potato fries to go. Everything tasted OLD! The wings weren't crispy and juicy they tasted like they sat all day then tossed in the seasoning or sauce to hide It. The fries LOOKED good but once again they tasted old. Not crispy and hot. Never again."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times.  The food is always good, and there is a great variety of both food and drinks.  Portion sizes are large, and we usually have leftovers.  One issue we have is with service.  It takes forever to get your food, even if there are
only a few tables with people seated.  It also seems as though the severs disappear frequently. We have to wait for long periods of time to place our order as well as get our check at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"They were off their game tonight! Ordered all drumettes ...came mixed. Ordered 12...got 10. They were cold. Had to ask for plates several times, had to ask for wet wipes several times...but Johnny on the spot with the bill!!! Only hood thing was the Carolina Panthers game was on the big screen and we are inside instead of in our stadium seats getting wet."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but PLEASE never have take out from them. Only have done it twice and they have messed it up horribly both times I tried with no discount."}
{"text":"Stopped in alone for lunch mid-afternoon on a Saturday.  The hostess asked if I would like a booth or a table instead of assuming I wanted to sit at the bar, which I appreciated.  My waitress, Janie, was great.  She answered all of my questions and I went with the Pub Burger, which she said was her favorite.  It was delicious!  The beer-battered fries were okay - I am not a huge fan of coated fries, but I could faintly taste the beer and they were both hot and crisp.  Good food and good service in a clean restaurant - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner before a concert,HUGE MISTAKE!! we were seated by the manager and then IGNORED for 15 mins....no drinks.....no order taken,no extra set of silverware our table was missing..NOTHING.....our waiter, a bored looking twit with a man bun sat watching tv and hanging with his fellow servers.....occasionally looking my way and ROLLING HIS EYES....but never once did he come over....we got up and left......I've been to several of their locations and always been happy,.. but this one does NOT deserve anyone's business...and clearly they do not want it...it serves as a hangout for staff and their friends......period...if you don't want to serve customers get OUT of the Customer service industry,it's not for you."}
{"text":"Ordered a triple b burger and got I'm not even sure they ran out of something and tried to add dressing on it like who does that without asking and I also asked for my burger to be well done it was definitely raw talking about pissed but the bartender was extremely helpful and nice"}
{"text":"I ordered wings that I just couldn't get cooked like I preferred. My waitress, Ebony was very patient and the manager, Jody was eventually sent over. Jody prepared the wings perfectly complete with a beautiful presentation which is very important to me. I will definitely return simply because of the exceptional service from Ebony and Jody."}
{"text":"So this place finally opened...living down in the center city it is.........as many seem to note in some form or another.........an alternative to Epicenter.

A large space with 2 levels, this has a very large bar on the ground floor and a smaller one on the second level.

This place gets packed during game night and even have a Monday night football event where someone can win $1000.

They have a large beer selection....so much so, I find the bartenders don't even know where all the beers all....I seem to always have to point out where the beer I want is located.

For this visit it was beers and a Picky Platter.......which is mainly just fried food, but good nonetheless.

I'm a fan......"}
{"text":"Below avg food.  Fish tacos lacked flavor.  Salad was sad.  Average beer selection.  Waitress was barely attentive, clearly didn't like her job.  Too pricey for the lack of quality.  can't recommend, glorified chili's."}
{"text":"This place is literally the worst out there!!! We live across the street and work in the industry so we get late nights. It is never properly staffed.... the bartenders are terrible and don't even acknowledge when new guests sit down; but with only one working on busy nights I guess they don't have time? The service is slow and takes forever to get refills or food that is ordered and the managers don't care about complaints. We left clearly very unhappy after waiting 12 mins for the bartender to say something to us and said something on the way out..... manager and other staff member didn't even apologize! Great customer service Carolina ale house"}
{"text":"Walked up at 7:25 on Christmas Eve, checked the sign on the door that said they were open till 8.  We seated ourselves per the sign and waited for a few minutes before a young server came over to us.  I explained I'd been on a mission to have onion rings for the past few days but because of the holidays and schedules, I hadn't found any. 

He apologized and said they don't serve onion rings but then quickly added they probably have some onion strings they use on sandwiches.  He said \"let me go check before the kitchen throws them out.\"  We laughed and thanked him and I very quickly decided, especially with it being Christmas Eve and him having such a cool personality, I was going to tip him very well.  

Before he can turn around to check, a very unpleasant female manager shows up and tersely tells us the kitchen is closing and they close at 8 and they want to be home with their families too.  .......ok.  The server looks at us like he's embarrassed by her comments and says he's sorry.  I wish I would have made a point of expressing myself while there but it was Christmas Eve and the last thing I wanted or needed was a confrontation or argument so we just left.

I'm going to stop back later and see if I can find the server and give him that tip.  But I'll never eat here or spend a dime here due to her attitude.  I get wanting to be home on the holidays but if that's the case, just close."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Unbelievable location in the heart of uptown. However this place has faIled itself for years and years. Not sure why but the bartenders have all been equally poor over the years. Another place managers don't understand their role and also go missing instead of trying to manage. . And nobody understands how to control TVs. And also don't understand why people are in the bar.If you're going to come to work why not try to make some tips? And then of course there is the loud intercom from 1986 that shouts out \"table for xxx. You're table is now available!\". Constantly interrupts the sports that are on and also scares the hell out of you in the meantime! needless to say this always occurs ofcourse when the bar is crowded and something good on. What a joke on so many levels.."}
{"text":"Came here on game.  It was crowded, loud, just as you would expect, but it's a nice place to come to.  Drink specials don't move me very much because they're usually beer specials and I despise beer, but even though they weren't on special, their other cocktails were worth it. 

Kaytee was our server and she did a phenomenal job, so I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Typical pub food...not disappointing at all...nothing different or unusual...decent beer selection...walking distance to the arena."}
{"text":"Carolina Ale House is using corporate bullying to sue a small, privately owned craft beer store in Atlanta, GA.  Ale Yeah! does not compete with this restaurant at all.   They are hundreds of miles from one another and Ale Yeah! Is a beer store, not a sports bar.   Please stop the madness by boycotting this establishment!   For all small business owners everywhere."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch all the time as they are right down the block from work. It's a typical sports bar atmosphere. Service USED to be pretty good, I could get in and out in about 30 minutes. The last few times it has gotten very slow and my order keeps getting screwed up. I usually just live with it and move on. Today was just to much. First I didn't get served for about ten minutes after being seated. Next I put my order in and was very surprised by how fast it came out. I tasted one of my wings and found out why. I order six wings GRILLED with honey buffalo sauce. These were fried with hot sauce. I send it back and have to wait again. They finally come out and the chicken is right, not great but it will do. I eat the wings and am ready for the veggies. Grab a carrot and it looks like they just pulled it out of the ground! I would not recommend this place. It seems lately any chain restaurant just doesn't care about service and it's a crapshoot to see what you will get. Definitely the last trip for me! 

I came back because I'm an idiot. Today they treated me to raw wings super slow service and the wrong sauce!! I took back a star for this one but hey at least I got a free iced tea out of it!"}
{"text":"First time to this Carolina Ale House, been to many others. This was as great as the best one so far - the one in Greenville SC downtown. The one here at Waverly - Great food, service, tons of TVs - had their Pub Burger, fries (beer battered fries - yes!). Chips and salsa, solid - added some of their killer queso on the side - which I used to dip my burger in, what? The server kept stopping by, as did the manager - really attentive people there, showing they care about service and customer engagement.  Yes, it was a good day."}
{"text":"2 bartenders had no idea what a Manhattan up is. 3rd one saved the day. Ordered the chicken quesadillas and it took about 25 minutes for them to come. Not a bad place if you just want to drink and not eat."}
{"text":"Fun for groups the food was good we had some wings and they were yummy.  The drinks were made perfect no over pour, meaning they didn't waste their money because I ordered two and finished them both.  Great service and very friendly employees."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. It's a sports bar for sure. Good environment. The food was decent. My daughters cheeseburger was not cooked all the way, but they recognized it after we ripped it open. I would come back to this place if I wanted a place to eat like Applebee's."}
{"text":"This is my go to Charlotte steakhouse although my friends phone definitely got stolen by the waiter she was so nice and she gave us extra fries. they took a little bit longer to come out then usual but I think she's just making sure that they were really hot for us.  we were testing to make sure she was doing her job right and don't worry when we asked for alcohol she politely declined. she was so sweet and definitely would smoke with her, she look just like zakiyah big brother. the only down side that my friend had a period in the seat but she wouldn't even give us a new stool because she said it's red leather and nobody would ever notice. smart thinking zakiyah!!! 10/10 would recommend. i love california ale house!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something different and it was our first time eating here. First meal we had in a very long time that was not disappointing. Everything was excellent. Pub burger was delicious and was recommend by our waiter."}
{"text":"Never come here. Rude service.  I asked for change for a $20 from the bartender and she refused to make change and got angry. I then left the change for my waiter and he assumed I was leaving him a $6 tip on a $12 bill. I had to ask him for my change back. Only bright side was the food was good."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Virginia where there are no Carolina Ale House restaurants. When I entered I was greeted by a warm and friendly hostess. Everyone at this location was smiling and was very eager to help. The outside seating has a fantastic view of the city. It was hard to choose from the many selections on the menu. The food came out in a timely manner and was very good. The assistant GM was on the floor overseeing the operation to ensure all patrons were being taken care of. For good food and service, at reasonable prices, Carolina Ale House is clearly the best selection."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection.  Great quality beers and service.  Had some good food at the bar and enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"We booked the upstairs after the marathon on Saturday, and we had a large group. Many of us ordered together, and the food was coming out in short spurts and in a weird order. We had asked the waitress to take our picture, and she was holding my phone when someone in our group asked about the food, since we were all starving. She pretty much flipped out and was very rude and nasty even though my friend had asked politely. She then slammed my phone down on the table and stormed away.
The food was very good when it appeared but I'm definitely going to have to rethink making a return trip."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the reviews. Walked down from Marriott. The service was bad and food was mediocre, at best. The waitress tried, but was never trained properly. Everything came at the same time, apps, salad, dinner. Without going into all details, it was about 1/2 right. I don't blame anyone, but a very poor management team. Wasted potential with that location."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping by CAH fairly regularly. It's usually more for a game and a beer vs. food. Had the tender strips and chicken sandwich and have enjoyed both. Fries are some of the best around. Not like any others, lightly battered and almost like a medium steak fry. Managers/staff always helpful to put a game on when we attend. Great selection of draft beers, plenty on tap. 
Gets busy on game day so just a heads up. I consider it more of a bar so I go for the drinks and atmosphere. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Since when do ale houses stop serving food at 100am on a Saturday night? And do last call at 130? I'm use to ale houses serving till 2am."}
{"text":"I tried giving Carolina Ale House a few shots and every time I was disappointed. 

The first time I went to CAH was for a Yelp elite event. The event itself was a lot of fun! But I'm just not sure how much CAH had to do with that. It seemed like the staff working it for us were kind of oblivious to what was going on. I will say though, the marketing guy (I think that's who it was) that was there represented CAH really well. He definitely did a nice job telling us all about the restaurant and it's amenities. 

The second time I came here was on a Friday night, so it was kind of busy but nothing out of the norm. Our waitress was not very friendly or attentive. We ordered our food once our friends arrived and boy were we in for a serious wait. It took about an hour for 3 salads and a soup to come out. And when those did finally come out, my boyfriends meal was still no where to be seen. 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes later still had not got his meal and our waitress had still not come to our table to see how our food was or if we needed anything! She finally came and we told her about the missing meal. About 10 more minutes later, a manager I assume came over and apologized giving my bf his meal. By this time we had been long done and he didn't want it anymore. They insisted they bag it up and we take it home, so we did but obviously we, especially my boyfriend, was less than pleased and hungry! 

The third time we came to CAH was on a Saturday around 3. A pretty random time to be eating so it was not busy at all! Again our waitress was not very nice nor was she attentive. The food this time was pretty good and the service was fast, but too fast!! We felt rushed the whole time and unwelcome. Our wing appetizer came out quickly and we barely got two bites in when our meals came out, which isn't the worse thing that can happen but makes it a little less enjoyable. We had been eating now about 10 minutes when the waitress came over and asked how everything was followed by asking if we wanted any dessert. I still had pretty much my whole meal on my plate as did my boyfriend. We had only been eating for about 10 minutes and again felt rushed. A few minutes later she came back and dropped off the check, with our plates still full! I couldn't believe it, I'd never seen something like it even with working in the service industry for about 8 years. We paid and I asked for a to-go box which not surprisingly never showed up, even though the waitress walked by 2 more times. 

It's safe to say I probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"The first thing you are faced with when you go to the Carolina ale house, or really any restaurant, is what to do with means you took to get there. How is it that this place just opened and there is no parking within 2 blocks of brand new planned community? They are opening new restaurants in that area like mad and parking gets more and more scarce. I would avoid patronizing this place or any other in Kingsley until they address the parking situation. There is mass produced beer and sh--y chicken wings all over fort mill, no need to hassle with this place."}
{"text":"Kind of like a tgi fridays with way better beer. The burger I ordered at medium was cooked well above temperature with no pink at all, but still tasted good.  The fries are really tasty.  The big complaint I have is that their pint night is Wednesday night, but most of their beers don't qualify for the $3 pints, which is fine, but it was kind of hard to figure out which beers on the menu were in stock and then which beers that were in stock were on pint night special."}
{"text":"very unfriendly at the bar. its not bad enough that they take your card like your in some under 18 club, but the bartenders are rude and you will sit with an empty glass until you finally say something.   there are tons more restaurants to go to    stay away!!"}
{"text":"Decent service - good place to grab a quick bite and catch a game. Had the Caribbean fish tacos and was pleasantly surprised! So much flavor and the fish was large! My boyfriend had the wing with just the dry rub and the sauce on the side and they were delicious! Nice and crispy - the dredge they use was really good and packed with flavor!"}
{"text":"I found this place good, lots of taps, with a great selection of local beers.
The burger was done as requested, nothing too special (except actually cooking it right), the fries were awesome however.

Menu had a poor layout (and I believe this is a chain), there was notes of a \"local beer\" highlighted flight, but it was not apparent, other than the note, what that might include, or highlights to what was local, other than the fine print under the beers.

Service was efficient, however you can quickly get forgotten in the crowd and don't bother trying to be social with the workers, they are very busy.

The downside was perhaps the worlds worst DJ, major ADD, songs played for 1 minute and switched - not crossfaded - and blaring (to be fair I think it was some kind of game I came on the end of).

I'll likely be back for the beer selection and fries, hopefully on a less popular night."}
{"text":"Right off of College St, the Ale House is a good option for lunch if you work uptown.  When I heard there was an Ale House opening in Charlotte, it brought back some good memories since I frequented their Raleigh location while I was in college.  Good times.

This location in the Charlotte Plaza building (black-glassed building, formerly emblazened by the Grant-Thornton logo... but now houses the Charlotte School of Law).  It shares the lower commercial space with Panera.  There is a lunch rush here, but I think it's not as much since it is a sit-down type place and not super quick, unless you sit at the bar.

There's a large bar located smack in the center of the restaurant space with a ton of TV's everywhere.  Tap handles galore in the center of the bar - I'm sure the place is pretty kickin' during football season.  There is also a fairly large outdoor patio that is pretty nice during the fall, but since there aren't any tall trees nearby, it can get fully exposed to the sun."}
{"text":"We went here Saturday and both the service and food were very poor.  Waitress was almost never available and the food service was slow.  We were a bit forgiving at first.  The place was full and it was race weekend.  But as it took longer and longer for our food, we realized none of the tables around us had turned- everyone was watching college football.  There are way better burger joints in Charlotte with more unique settings, better sevice, better management, better BEER selection, and way better food."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to...especially on Wednesday for their draft specials. Apparently they changed the special and failed to tell the servers? After talking to the manager he was well less than attentive. Burger was undercooked and greasy....nachos...lacked meat but tons of what looked like cheese wiz ....wife's tuna salad was overcooked and the wait was way too long as they were not yet packed. I live close by and used to go every week with work associates and sometimes wife and daughter. But lately the food is a miss and well can't get the beer wrong I guess if it's cold. Even my daughters to go order of sliders and fries was eh....how do you get basic sliders and fries wrong? Unfortunately I will look for a new go to.....convenience yes but I want value for money spent. Only gave 2 stars based on memories of what once was...it's probably a 1."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is absolutely atrocious! There is  a large business park with thousands of employees so you would think the restaurant would be prepared for extremely busy lunch rush and happy hours. NOT!!! A group of 9 of my coworkers went to lunch at 1:30, after the lunch rush. We were seated at 1:38. We advised our server that we were ordering in to go boxes and we wanted our checks at the same time. She finished taking our orders at 1:45. We did not get waters until 2 o'clock. Adult beverages didn't come until 2:10. Our food came out at 2:20 and most of the orders were wrong!!! The restaurant wasn't busy at all. The bartender appeared to be walking in quicksand. Our waitress appeared to be extremely overwhelmed. The mangers showed no urgency in helping the situation. This was my 4th or 5th visit and it will definitely be my last. They only get one star because they have a good beer selection. Too bad it takes forever to get one."}
{"text":"Our server was delightful. She was on time and attentive, but gave us space when needed. I had the turkey avocado wrap with the house salad and a side of yellow mustard dressing. Mm mm yum! Hit the spot right when I needed a mid-day pick me up. In town for a wedding and will be coming back to this down town establishment right when the maid of honor gets hitched!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I just had drinks here so this review is purely on service. Kelly...you are awesome! Okay...the entire crew rocked. Excellent view of the concrete jungle. I'll most certainly eat on my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to choices in Fort Mill. I stopped in for lunch by myself on a weekday. The shredded chicken tacos were good, although so overstuffed that they were difficult/sloppy to manage. The waffle cut sweet potato fries that I substituted for the normal side were very very good - I'll come back just for those!
Price of $10 was reasonable. 
The place just opened so I'll make allowances for that. The (large young and ethnically diverse) staff appears to be having trouble figuri g out the table numbering systems so maybe they should add a letter indicating zone such as L1-3 for the tables near the left hand window. 
This place is big and noisy. 
I appreciate the outdoor bar and side lawn set up like a small amphitheater. I hope there will be live music. 
Ambiance is sports bar. I could see 18 big screens from my seat. Not the place for an intimate conversation."}
{"text":"I think the layout is great and grabbing a seat at the bar on a Saturday night wasn't too hard as most people were just waiting to be seated for dinner.  The menu looks ok, but we only came for a couple of drinks and to watch the Series for a little while before heading over to the Double Door Inn.  The bartenders were all friendly and checked on us often to make sure we were doing ok.  We ordered the apple dessert to just have a bit of something sweet.  It tasted fine, nothing special, but it wasn't even warmed up at all, so you know it's just out of the box and not fresh made.  It's a bar, though so I wasn't expecting anything major.  I love they have tv's on the inside of the bar set area itself.  We enjoyed the atmosphere and we are happy to know they serve their full menu until 2am!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THE UPTOWN CHARLOTTE LOCATION. Service was horrible, food was disgusting, never saw our server unless I asked someone else for something, then he'd show up. My nachos was cold when they came out of the kitchen from the chips down to cheese sauce they drowned it in. The warmest thing on my dish was the sour cream they plopped on top of the cheese. Need I remind you that I never saw my server to send it back to the kitchen. If I could rate it in the negatives I would. NEVER GO!!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time. Glad we did. They have an exceptional selection of beer, oh yes, and ale. Food was okay but the pale ale was excellent. The wait staff was really friendly and efficient even though it was crowded. And thank you to Leslie at the front desk. You couldn't ask for a nicer or a more helpful maitre d'"}
{"text":"Two not to so good experiences.

1)Went with co-workers for early lunch. There were 8 of us..Took 45 mins to get even one plate, meals were lukewarm. The waitress was rude and rushed us for orders and dissappeared. Half the party complained to manager and they discounted our meal. Ugh.

2) Today i had an hour to grab a burger before my 6pm class. It was not crowded. Placed my order at bar within 5 minutes (trying to get bartenders attn). After 20 mins, looked up and realized no one else had food (6 tables).They only had drinks. Finally got a lukewarm, dry burger after 30 mins. The cheese never melted. Bartender never said a word about the wait. I ate it bc i had not eaten all day and had only 15 to eat before my class. Never again."}
{"text":"They bread the wings.  I know that is a Southern thing but wings are a Northern food.

They reserve seats for folks who never show.  The waitstaff are friendly but the management is rude to the servers right in front of the patrons.  Disheartening at least."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I were in charlotte for one night and wanted a good place to watch Monday night football. We decided on this place and we are so glad that we did! A ton of local beers to try and a scratch kitchen, this place really does it right. John the bartender made us feel like we were at home (seeing as we were here bc of The hurricane was very important) he recommended the dry rub wings, which I had..holy amazing. Crispy in the outside tender on the inside. My fianc√© had the pub burger equally as delicious. If your in charlotte stop by here and ask for John! We will definitely be back the next time we are in charlotte."}
{"text":"This place might be exactly what you are looking for in a sports bar and though I've only been here once and this review is only based on that one visit, it's only going to get 2 stars. I might go back, but it is doubtful.

I'm still not sure what the real problem is, but there were four of us. Three ordered a variance of a burger the other ordered wings - dry rubbed! We all received our burger and fries, but my colleague hadn't gotten his wings at the same time.

Not only didn't he get his wings with us - the minutes passed by until I went to talk to a member of management about it as almost 20 minutes had passed and there were no wings. He finally got them, they were not dry rubbed, but he was hungry and he ate them anyhow AND they didn't charge us for them.

This could have easily been a three star or even 4 star had they done a bit more for an obvious flaw on their part.

My hamburger and fries were really good, but based on this service - I may not return. Plus the server who tried to be witty and match our sense of humor fell short and it just came across wrong!"}
{"text":"One of our go to's !! Loaded nachos & fries are AMAZING ! Good atmosphere to have beers with friends !"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good... Great location.. Atmosphere is relaxed and the food is great!  Now on to the bad... I've been here twice and so far the service sucks. 1st time the waitress messed up at least 1 thing about every single thing that was ordered.  Food took 4ever to come out. The manager gave us our app free because it never came our until after the meal. I tried to order a margarita and but whatever I was given tasted like lighter fluid smells. The 2nd visit went a little better but our waiter disappeared and we were waiting around 4ever to pay. Finally we had to flag down 2 other waiters to see if they could get us our bill. Hopefully the service gets better!"}
{"text":"They got off to a rough start, but seem to have ironed out the wrinkles lately. This place is all about the beer and the modern location. The food is average, but let's be honest... Nobody's expecting gourmet food at a sports bar. The wait is always 30 minutes to an hour, however Kingsley beside the amphitheater and river, with a large outdoor bar, is the best spot in Fort Mill to have to wait to be seated. And best selection in the area of local and import beers, with many on tap... Including multiple IPA's. Plus they have Hop Drop N Roll, one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Good place to hangout and eat with friends. Service was great and food was pretty good. The prices aren't bad, either. I had the frickles as an appetizer and pub burger and fries as an entr√©e. All very good."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and the service is always slow. Although they have a good beer selection, they're often out of whatever my first choice is.

I recently tried the reuben and it was pretty average overall. The corned beef was a bit dry and the kraut was cooked on the griddle, creating a stringy texture that's unpleasant for sandwiches. The crust was too thick while the bread was too thin which clearly meant a wrong choice of bread. I've had worse reubens in my adventure around Charlotte but I've certainly had much better as well. 

After the review someone from the restaurant reached out about additional feedback, and I do appreciate them taking the time to read these reviews and make changes!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if you want a good beer selection and some fried bar food...definitely come here. They have a large selection of good beers on tap. 

However, I will not be back. The food we got (baja chicken salad and buffalo chicken wrap) were mediocre. The chicken on the salad was ice cold...not sure if that was the intent, but it was not appealing. Asked for dressing on the side...didn't happen. Also, the ticket/paper for the kitchen was actually on the plate under the wrap and fries and wasn't visible until most of the food was eaten, not terribly gross...just kinda lazy/unappealing. Also...lots of grease was soaked up by the receipt, so maybe that's a silver lining. 

The music at 1pm on a Sunday was cranked up as if we were in a club. 

But, our server, Jessica was very nice and attentive. No complaints there."}
{"text":"I hope to provide an updated review with more stars. 

I thought it was a so-so experience. Yes, they were 9 days old so as with most new places they were jam packed - at least outside (since we only went to have a drink outside.) It was frustrating how long it took to finally get two beers. There was really zero acknowledgement while standing at the bar until a bartender became free... I guess every bartender is different with how they handle a busy bar. I did like the large amount of draft beer options.

We finally decided to stay and have a small dinner. Girlfriend got an outside table then walked to the restroom, while I closed out at the bar .. within that brief time, another employee walked by and decided to remove the menus and silverware setting... umm ok?

After we finally got our table setting back, we decided on each choosing chicken and shrimp tacos to split. The tacos were very tasty, but the rice as a side seemed to be lacking in flavor and quantity.

Again, hope to be back and have a better time."}
{"text":"While the location of the \"ale house\" is nice - right in the midst of uptown - is nice, the atmosphere leaves something to be desired. Of course, that could be because it is in Charlotte. I mean most of our venues really don't have a lot of history to them, since we have this tendency to tear things down if they are older than a few years in order to put up something new (and \"better\" if you believe everything you read).

In this case, it means that you get atmosphere that consists of modern and open, which isn't altogether bad - but an ale house should be more akin to the Irish public house (naturally known as a pub). These are often not as well lit, use wood more than steel, and while they may have plenty of comfort food, they are a far more enjoyable way to spend the afternoon/evening/whatever time you happen upon them.

If you want a generic sports bar that leaves nothing memorable, then by all means, head on over. Otherwise, you might want to keep looking for something with a bit more to it. Just let me know if you find anything."}
{"text":"It's a convenient spot to watch games while drinking beer. They have a good collection of beers and we do like the wings, especially the Spicy Thai wings -- those are my favorite. However lately we have noticed that their wings can be hit or miss. The other day we got the spicy Thai wings to go and they were actually pretty bad with not enough sauce/seasoning. Tasted pretty much like unseasoned, plain wings. Unfortunately, over the phone they said it would take 20 minutes but after my husband got there he had to wait for an additional 40 minutes so after we got home and found out our wings were sub-par, we weren't going to take them back to wait an additional don't know how long. We're pretty upset at how this place has gone downhill in the last 3 years."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and got sat at the bar area. Wings are good and decent size. We got the hot flavor and it was spicy! We also tried the fried pickles. They were a little soggy."}
{"text":"Nothing like the one in concord mills. Waiter was inattentive and focused on larger parties (it was my wife and I with our daughter). Mixed up wife's beer order from lack of attention. Checked in with us once after order put in the whole time we were there. When food came out their buffalo chicken wrap has one chicken tender in it and all lettuce. Overall disappointed with this new addition to the neighborhood especially after being used to carolina ale house experiences that are overwhelmingly positive in concord."}
{"text":"Wouldn't be bad except for the fact that they're charging 12.99 for a small portion of meat and some simple ingredients. Would have overlooked that if the orzo wasn't swimming in olive oil, we could get the beer choices correctly and the waitress didn't short change me on the check. Probably won't be back. This spot doesn't hold a candle against Duckworth's in Mooresville."}
{"text":"Was here Friday night. I wasn't surprised about the 40 minutes wait. The beer sample table in the lobby was a plus. Since this place just opened, I was impressed how efficient the staff were and friendly, too. We had the sweet potato fry appetizer, two veggie burgers, and a brisket burger. The food was good, but nothing special. The place is a sports bar with a lot of TVs and was very, very loud. Too loud to hold a conversation. Three stars overall--four for service, three for atmosphere, two for food. If you like sports bar, chain restaurant type places, then \"Ale Yeah\" go to Carolina Ale House."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Typical bar food, mediocre quality at best. Nice patio, but food was not great & service was terrible on patio. All around disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Boring.  I was expecting a bit more for a place that sounds like they have craft ales.  
Instead, it was cookie cutter, same ole, same ole.

Sure they have cold beer, but who doesn;t these days? 

So, nothing special here, besides wings and beer."}
{"text":"Nice bar. Great beer selection. Had the Four Friends Queen City Red (local Irish Red Ale) and the Highland Oatmeal Porter (brewed in Ashville, dark and full tasting beer). Also had a taste of the Buffalo Shrimp Salad (buffalo beer-battered shrimp over fresh greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers & red onions; served in a tortilla bowl). Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went here for a Thursday night football game. They had many TVs. We started with a plate of pork nachos. They were delicious but I felt like they could've added some more meat. I ordered the Carolina 'cue club platter. The pork was delicious and savory. I upgraded to their hottest wings. They did not disappoint. They packed a big punch with a burst of flavor. They also had maybe 30 beers on tap, including 10 or so Carolina brews. This was one of my best dining experiences in 4 weeks of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sports bar beer place that had tons of tv, average pub food, nice servers, got noisy and some entertaining patrons. we went here on Friday night to grab some dinner and watch some of the Celts vs sixers game. It was nice because we also got to sneak some of the sox losing (go figure LOL!). Food was standard pub food- wings, fried pickles, burgers, salads, soups and the like. TONS of beer for selection. TONS! And this is where i found out they have FAT TIRE on the east coast! I was in love for that alone! Good place for decent food and beer and to watch sports. I would go back for the last two before the first.....but atleast know they do have average decent pub fare."}
{"text":"At a minimum, there 3 things a restaurant should have - good food, good service and a clean bathroom. This place lacked the good food. My husband had a dirty knife, lipstick on his coffee cup (really wasn't his shade), and cold fries. My grilled cod fish tacos were lukewarm at best. We sat in the patio and the floor was sticky and had trash on it. Server took off $5 for the trouble. Manager checked before we left and we told him all of the above. He gave us a $25 voucher to come back. If you love beer, than this will be a 5-star place to come. However, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Completely average typical sports bar. The food is alright and pretty cheap with decent portions. The service is alright too, although we had a bit of trouble with a large party this past week. Overall, it's not a bad spot to stop but I wouldn't seek it out either."}
{"text":"I like this location as well as the one in uptown. The food is always good. I have never had a bad meal. I love that they have local beer on tap, and I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived and it was $3 pint night (Hell Yeah!).

I enjoyed the BBQ BLT salad, yes I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but it was very good. The chicken tortilla soup was also quite yummy. Service was great as was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Jann the server was amazing! The manager James  unfortunately tried to kick us for singing happy birthday too enthusiasticly at 10 pm on a Friday night. Too bad so sad. We found a seat on the patio where we went to a bother to other other patrons and yahn was happy to help us . Love yahn and Sara!!! Too bad about manager James but we will be back anyway"}
{"text":"This may be the best place in Charlotte, actually North Carolina to not only watch a Panthers game but experience football period. The staff was amazing they were fun, fast, and friendly. From observing the staff as a whole they not only offered great service but treated everyone else like family. When it was time to order food if our waitress felt we could get more bang for our buck she gave us that option *and yes we went with more bang for the buck* I highly recommend this place for any football and food fan out there. The management staff Ayaan, Brenda, and Dianna *spell check* not only wore the best jerseys in the country (Cam Newton), but they personally greeted every table and every customer at the bar"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and I have to say it's hit or miss. I have meet the manger and he's a very nice guy but the are suffering from finding good staff. 

We decided to go tonight for dinner and sat at the outside bar. The Afternoon server was just about to go and after we ordered she asked if she could cash us out instead of transferring the check. We agreed because she asked. I didn't realize that the Evening staff would try to charge us double for our drinks. I didn't keep a copy from the first check so I didn't have any backup. They still over charged us and she said the next time we come in she would buy us our first round. I don't want a free drink I just don't want to be overcharged.

I just wanted to let you know to keep track."}
{"text":"The day crew and regular servers are pretty good, as is the food; but the night bartenders are just awful. They're slow, unable to manage multiple tasks, and not particularly friendly."}
{"text":"No draft beer available, and the kitchen really let the side down. Ordered the Carolina dipper. Came out soggy and not very flavorful."}
{"text":"The service was good but that's about all that was good. Me and my wife ordered the French onion soup, a bowl of chilli and an appetizer sampler. The sampler was cold and the fried pickles were soggy and the wings were gross, the chili was mediocre and packed with beans, and the French onion soup tasted like it came from a can and had been sitting out for a hour. I wouldn't come back here again, very disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with coworkers after work. Must say the beer selection is quite expansive - 72 on tap? Wow. Lots of local brewery selections as well. I had a nice Lonerider Sweet Josie Brown with some quesadillas (was pretty decent food for a bar). No problems whatsoever with service. Hopefully not the last time I come to this place!"}
{"text":"Ale Yeah! This is the place to go in waverly.  You are welcomed with smiles, great service, great food, great drinks, managers come and check on you and your experience and they too are hands on helping serve and clean. Environment is uplifting!!!Awesome!!!  Ale Yeah! You got my business!!! People it's a sports bar!!!  It's going Be loud and fun!!!  Ale Yeah!"}
{"text":"Concierge at the Westin recommended this place.  Okay food.  Service would have been slow if we didn't tell our server that we had to get somewhere in a hurry.  If we didn't say anything I think we would've been here for hours.  They're on island time here.  We sat near the back.  Tables were pretty full and there were 6 servers chatting in the back.  Everyone on break?  I don't see this place as somewhere I'll come back to."}
{"text":"The service was good and the employees were very friendly, but my issue is with cleanliness. Before we were seated they needed to clear a table, but we watched as the girl just wiped of the table with one quick swipe, brushing everything off onto the seats. So when we were seated, there was food crumbs on the seat. And the floor was terrible. They really should have swept before seating us. It was really disgusting. My appetite was ruined, so we ended up just getting an appetizer and drink. Our previous experience here was a good one, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Kind of a mess. We were a large group but we had three people not even get their food by the time the rest of us were finished eating. One guy finally got his food and it was wrong. Very slow to get drinks. Overall bad service, unorganized staff/kitchen and just mediocre food."}
{"text":"This is about the only place in downtown Charlotte that serves food past midnight, so by default it was our only food option after finishing up work for the day. Would I choose this place for dinner during normal dinner hours? No. The service was lackluster. The food was lukewarm and looked as if my 5yr old daughter put it together. I'm not sure the bartender on this particular night knew what he was doing. It's really hard to mess up a gin & tonic, but somehow this guy did on two repeated tries. After a second failed attempt I gave it back and opted for water. Overall, this place was a major disappointment. I don't remember my experience being this poo back in 2016. Other reviews suggest new management. Maybe that's the case. Either way, should you go? No. Check out other great eateries in the area like Cowbell Whiskey Bar or The Wooden Vine."}
{"text":"The french dip was horrible. Couldnt force my self to eat it. Service was horrible decent beer selection but over all pretty shitty. Wings where also bad the sauce was extra greasy."}
{"text":"A big college football Saturday and they had 2 bartenders. Horrible service, okay food, and they change the channels to anyone's whim. Meaning, if a top 25 team is playing and two nothing teams are playing there is no rhyme or reason to changing the channel. Won't be back."}
{"text":"As an uptowner working the 9-5 gig, this place was a welcome distraction from the usual for me.  Steak for lunch on a Friday?  YES, PLEASE!  I had the flat iron steak with double veggies - and wowser, it was great (and decently priced, considering).  

They were really accommodating with my order (no croutons on the salad, double veggies, no potatoes or bread).  I was expecting a limp pile of sauteed squash, carrots, and broccoli, but to my surprise it was a delicious pile of crisp green beans, carrots, onions, red peppers, and a few squash dashed in there.  Very nice.  One of my co-workers got the CAH Pub Burger, and it looked scrumptious (all hail the onion straw).  I would definitely come here again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are in a hurry! Service is extremely slow and the wait staff, cooks and bartenders do not seem to have a sense of urgency. The food isn't bad but this restaurant lacks in customer service!"}
{"text":"The food and service was great as usual but the management today was unprofessional. I saw someone going into the kitchen with just flip flops and lounge pants so I asked my server who that was and they said unfortunately that is our general manager. I generally don't write reviews but I feel that this is an issue that Carolina Ale House needs to look into before they have an issue on their hands due to lack of common sense."}
{"text":"There is nothing that drives me more crazy - then walking into a restaurant with a large party of about 12 people (last minute dinner plans) and being told in an unwelcoming manor that you should have made reservations and your wait is going to be over two hours.  (Yes, I understand you were busy - every restaurant in the area was due to the Spartan Race that day, FYI. Wait time ended up being about an hour.)  However, you should be happy that our party decided to dine at your restaurant and not one of the many other places in the area.  Once seated, the wait staff was extremely nice and accommodating, took quite a while to get food and bill at the end - but overall it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"No kids so we thought we would try a new spot in Waverly. The traffic near CAH was insane. Too busy for my taste. Hostesses were not very engaging. Our estimated wait was 25 min and we waited 40. Ordered the baked shrimp pasta and was disappointed ... way too rich. The waitress was awesome and offered me another option. She was the one bright spot! I chose the veggie burger and was disappointed with it too. Even my fries were too salty. Very loud atmosphere and hard to move around inside. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went on a night their taps were down so we had to have bottles/cans.  Bartenders didn't know the beers but we got by anyhow.  Chipotle wings were delicious though and made up for it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I encountered at a restaurant. The hostess had a distinct attitude about her like she didn't want to be there. On top of that, she didn't greet us like she is supposed to. Also, when we asked for a booth instead of a table she rolled her eyes at us. When we ordered our food, one of us ordered soup with our meal, and once the food was brought out, the waitress brought us the wrong soup. She told us the chef said the special was different. She left the table and came back a few minutes later saying the chef was wrong and the original soup special she said it was, they actually still had. So she brought us out a cup of that soup as well, which wasn't that great after all was said and done. Also, my girlfriends chicken sandwich was supposed to be a buffalo chicken sandwich, but it was a poor excuse of one. There was no buffalo sauce on it and I have seen pieces of toast that were more moist than this sandwich. The burger I had was decent, but nothing to write home about. Oh yeah, and did I mention that my girlfriend found a bug in her water? I will not be coming back to this location. My experience at the location in Uptown Charlotte was 100 times better."}
{"text":"We were a table of four...arrived at 3:00 for an early dinner because previously came at 5:00 and there was no parking for my handicapped husband. That parking situation was the worst.
We all enjoyed our dinners and the sandwich dipper was very tasty. Great service and noise level good, since it wasn't crowded at that hour.
Will definitely come again, early."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  Do not waste your time!  Drove down from Chicago for the Bears game and went to ale house on a Saturday night with 6 friends.  We sat down and noticed the table was not cleaned from previous patrons,  so my boyfriend asked the waitress to clean it.  She agreed but never came back.  Then my boyfriend asked another waitress that walked past if she would clean it and she said sure.  To make a long story short, she didn't clean the table and so we asked for the manager.  The manager, D Sellers, showed up but only to make excuses for the workers.  He should have come with a rag in his hand!!  Poorly managed bar!!!!! I thought the manager would at least pick up a rag.  WE ALL WALKED OUT!!!! Never again! This place deserves 0 stars!"}
{"text":"We sat right by the food prep area. One waitress seemed to have a homicidal expression and I watched her get pissed about a tip she was given (... perhaps smile more?). Our order was messed up. The whole thing... both apps, both salads, and both entrees were wrong each time. My burger was waaaay over cooked but at that point I was just ready to leave. Not the end of the world, but worth posting. Very loud too. I like concord location better. 


Long wait sent us to find seating at the bar. Also parking was hard to find."}
{"text":"Sure, they have a great beer selection, but you can only go here if you're NOT hungry. The food is pretty terrible and the service was even worse. I'm talking 10 minutes for a beer to arrive after we ordered it. 

We had the cheese fries appetizer \"Carolina loaded,\"  which means it comes with pulled pork barbecue on it, along with some variation on ranch dressing. It came out absolutely doused in BBQ and ranch, so much so that it was difficult to stomach. It was hard to find the fries underneath all of the sauce. 

We also had the buffalo chicken wrap, which was nothing special. It came in a green tortilla to boot (not exactly what you'd expect, and not a pleasant surprise). 

We also order the Baja grilled chicken salad, which was basically a chicken salad with a Southwestern twist. It was lackluster, even as bar food goes. For some reason it came with sour cream and salsa on the side (as if I would put those on my salad..?). The Southwestern ranch dressing was bland and barely noticeable. I didn't finish it, and that's saying something. 

Overall, it was just...bland. Not memorable. We won't be back. There are plenty of other places in the area that have a similar if not better beer selection AND serve good food."}
{"text":"It was a Monday night, so not super busy, but it took 20 minutes to get a beer menu, in the bar area where there were open seats.   Another 10 minutes for a food menu.  Food was pretty good, although it came nearly an hour after walking in and came with no silverware or ketchup for the fries.   Server disappeared before I realized either of these things, so I ate dry fries and the rest of my meal with my fingers.   Tried ordering a second beer, after 15 minutes the server came back and said they were out of that one, so I finally gave up.  Overall, the server was not rude, there just wasn't enough service, by a long shot.   Two stars because I left wanting more beer and maybe dessert, but not willing to wait another hour."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving wings hard. We came here and were not disappointed. They were delicious and a great size. We're moving down to the area in two weeks and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Totally forgot to review this place when I went a few weeks back for a co-worker's bday. 

Food was whatevs, beers were meh.  Was surprised that Oktoberfest was still on the menu so I tried to order that, heh.  It wasn't--they should update their menu or say something like \"seasonal\"

Disappointed at how the hostess had no idea about birthday desserts as their menus advertised.  Told them while we had a few drinks, that we're here for a friend's bday and we'd like to get the birthday dessert. She had no idea what I was talking about.  So I had to track down our 20yr-old waitress who was able to get a dessert for him.  

Doesn't their menu say you get your choice of dessert for free if it's your birthday or something?  I really didn't get to choose, she just brought out an average chocolate cake slice or something without a candle, just a slice, very unceremonious.

End of the night, I told her that I'd be paying for the dessert (as a joke, bc she acknowledged to me that it was free).  I find out later from a buddy that the cake wasn't free and that HE paid for it. 

So: (1) it wasn't free; and (2) the wrong person got charged.  Yeah, it's not like the premier place to celebrate a birthday, maybe just grab drinks after work - like we did.  Shouldn't say that dessert is free if it isn't though :/

dmo out."}
{"text":"This place has good food but the people who work there aren't so friendly. They almost always take there time getting to the table, after talking with the other employees for a while. This is the main reason I don't go anymore."}
{"text":"If you are a lover of wings you must try the jumbo wings at Carolina Ale House. The wings are huge and meaty which helps the sauce stick to them. They only offer around 6 flavors and i would recommend the Thai chili.

Try the sampler platter to get a taste of the fried pickles, mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders (which can be sauced as well) and the jumbo wings. Lots of tv so it is a great place to catch a ballgame. 

Plan on being a frequent customer of CAH!"}
{"text":"Service was so so, about what you would expect from a newly opened restaurant.  Waited for awhile for drinks, never checked on for quality of food, waited for a while for a check. They wouldn't let us eat outside, we assumed it was because they were short staffed.  The food was just ok.  Flavors didn't really stand out.  If I would have been having beer with my meal I might be more pleased with a undersized wrap and a small portion of fries."}
{"text":"The only thing that this place has going for them is the location.  The layout is pretty cool with a bar upstairs and downstairs.

I was not impressed with the London Broil sandwich.  I also tried the Carolina Dipper and felt it was lacking a little something.  I feel like this is the kind of place you just have to get a hamburger.  Everyone thought that the french fries were pretty good.  

The service was not that great but I do not expect great service from a place like this anyways.  The hostesses were not mean but not very nice.  I asked our server for raw onions instead of onion straws and they forgot lettuce and tomato.  They also messed up another person's order that was in our party.

I was there in the afternoon on a weekend.  There was lots of room at this time even with all of the WV basketball fans there."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to watch any kind of sporting event, but it's LOUD LOUD LOUD. Not a date-night kind of place if you want to talk to the people you're dining with. Plenty of tables so if you have a wait, it could be shorter than you're quoted. Food is solid for bar cuisine, wings and seasonings are great & the fries are always fresh and not uber greasy (at least not on our visits). Servers are generally friendly, but when it's busy, don't wait until you're starving as the food will take AWHILE to arrive. (Drinks can be slow on the refill too, so maybe order ahead). Kiddos dig the cuisine and they get two sides with their meals so it's always a hit when they have a choice."}
{"text":"I used to work in a building next to the ale house when I lived in Charlotte and could always count on this place for a decent meal or cold ones.  The food is always solid and service is good."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to this locstion. I was meeting some friends and I was slightly early so I took a seat on the patio. It may be the waitstaff plan for the patio but no one approached me for the 22 min I sat there. Frankly I was fine with that as I was waiting on my party to arrive. When my.party arrived we moved inside and asked for a booth and were seated immediately.  Our waiter was attentive and timely. We ordered multiple beers and food with no issues. Our waiter keep tabs on us and made sure we were taken care of. We had  no issues and I ll return. They have a good beer selection with lots of variety. Good choice for a sports bar hookup."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed. This restaurant unfortunately has gone down hill within the last year. The food was always good however the service has greatly failed. Young immature waitstaff who clearly don't want to be there. 

 I also would like to mention that we visited on a Saturday around noon and three beers (the first three beers we wanted to try) they were out of. How can you be an \"alehouse\" and advertise so many different beers and be out of so many of them...especially a Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place opened not that long ago and it was close by, so it was a must-see for us. There is still a lot of construction going on around the restaurant, so it will be a nicer place once all that is done.

In the mean time ... We found the entrance to be confusing. You park in the open lot, which is the back side of the restaurant -- even though it looks like there may be an entrance there. We then noticed a small sign that said the entrance was around the front ... even though we thought we were at the front ... yeah, confusing. Walking around we see that the entrance is facing other (unopened) stores. Maybe the idea is once all the stores are completed, one would walk around and the entrance would be obvious. For now, it is anything but obvious ...

We found a table quickly (Saturday about noon) and thought the set-up and decor was great. I had never been to one of these \"chain' restaurants before, so this was a treat. The drink menu struck me odd... a place claiming to be an \"ale\" house had the cheapest beers on the planet ... really? Coors, Budweiser, PBR? The server even told me they had a special going on with the PBR. Pass. I settled for something that sounded unusual since I am always willing to try something new. There was plenty of other choices to try if you don't want one of the off-the-shelf cheapo beers in a can.

Service was prompt and food came quickly. Food was excellent and prepared perfectly. No complaints whatsoever.

No fault of the restaurant, but we noticed that there were a LOT of kids coming here. This is a very popular place for young families.

Everything was great with the exception of a small issue. The staff takes their breaks out in the front of the entrance. There is a seating patio there for guests (which was vacant at the time) and I saw one of the servers or cook flick his discarded cigarette to the ground. Then I looked around and saw that there was a sea of discarded butts. Disgusting and distasteful! I noticed that there was no ashtray outside for the butts to be discarded. I brought this up to one of the staff as we were leaving. Also, the servers on break should not be in view of the patrons watching them out the window puff away. Just isn't something I really want to see while I am eating my food next to the window. Not a great \"view\".

Overall a good place, and will probably improve as surrounding construction completes."}
{"text":"I frequently visit the uptown NC location so I wasn't expecting anything too different with this location . Stopped in here with a coworker , think our waitress wasn't accustomed to her position yet , she seem flustered ,  bless her heart bc it wasn't busy yet . 

Ordered my usual roasted wings , taste was great, food came out pretty quick and seasoned great as usual . Nice how the restaurant overlooks a lake and had an attractive outdoor seating setup . 

I'll visit once in awhile , my only suggestion have some servers that can handle a heavy lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Pretty much your standard up-scale sports bar.

Stopped here with a group of 7 for before-the-game food and drinks for the ACC championship game.  Had to wait a bit for a table, but that was expected.  Once seated, the service was spotty to poor.  I think they had enough servers to cover, but our server would disappear for long stretches of time.
 
Good beer selection, but they were out of a lot of it.  On a Saturday night.  Took several tries to get someone, ANYone, to bring us a missing set of silverware.  Oh, and the ketchup.  Oh, and where is the wrap that we ordered the same time as all the other food?  Remember that non-chipotle-ranch you were supposed to bring 15 minutes ago?
 
Drink orders took a long time to materialize, too.

It was a busy night.  I get it.  You're a high-volume sports bar.  You should get it, too."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant as part of an anniversary and sat in the bar area.  Our waitress was serviceable and for the most part she did her job with enthusiasm.  The menu was good with offering that range from typical pub fare to healthy.  Our table ranged through the menu and our food was delivered.  The four star part came in the part of the manager and his knowledge of beer and his desire to show that NC beers could hold their own.  The manager engaged us in a beer conversation that spanned all over the south and how they compared to beers in Texas.  His knowledge of beer pairings to our food was impressive and he turned some of our party into NC craft beer converts."}
{"text":"Everything is \"good.\" The food, the service, the atmosphere are all okay. Nothing exceptional. I went there last night to watch my NHL team play.

I ordered a cheese steak, and my wife ordered a buffalo wrap. My friends ordered nachos and fried pickles. All good, and their selection of beers is really good. But overall, I would stick with the neighborhood sports bar and not make the trip just to watch my teams."}
{"text":"When we walked in, there were about 5 employees standing there and never greeted us. We had to say something to be seated. Once we were seated, our table top was not clean at all so the hostess came back and wiped it down. It took about 15 minutes for our waiter to even acknowledge us, and then it took another 30 minutes just to get our food, which they clearly didn't communicate because they put our order in twice. The plates the waiter gave us for appetizers were super dirty. They had about 8 employees wondering around aimlessly, yet the floors were disgusting! Trash was everywhere and no one had the decency to just pick up a broom and sweep it up. We were totally disappointed because we have been here before when they were slammed, and everything went well. But this night, they were over staffed and not that busy at all. I never write reviews, but something needs to be said when every single job that was required for a restaurant, wasn't done properly at all. We should've paid attention to the fact that they scored a 90 on their health inspection. Disgusting! We definitely will not ever be coming back to this restaurant ever again!"}
{"text":"Maybe instead of worrying so much about the new drink tickets on the printer the manager should worry about the TVs and the keg levels. Beer was flat and poker on tv instead of NFL on Sunday???"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Friday. Sat on the patio where we were the 2nd table to be seated. Many of the tables were dirty and needed to be wiped down . Our table had something sticky on it. The receptionist sat us (2people) my friend went to the restroom. I ordered 2 beers but the server said he could only bring one since he hadn't seen my friend. Maybe not the best rule for a restaurant?  Once the food was delivered I  had to go to receptionist to ask for a condiment. Not very impressed with the service."}
{"text":"Used to be good when they first opened, then the place went to hell! Service is horrible, food is horrible too. How do you screw up extra crispy wings? I sent the first order back, and they had the nerve to send me back the same Wings like I wouldn't know!! Finally, 20 minutes later, a new order arrived but still wrong. I've been there 3x and they have gotten it wrong all 3 times! Not that I really care for breaded Wings anyway, but their Carolina Wings can not touch Boardwalk Billies' Smokehouse Wings...which should compare.  This place is another craft beer bar trying to sell food. That's it! Moving on...  Also , not any of these times did a manager come over to try and fix the issue, nor have I ever seen a manager there or someone looking like one.  Skipping this place from now on unless, I'm looking just to have a drink."}
{"text":"Here's the problem with this place. They call themselves Ale House and have a decent number of taps. They have a static beer menu, but some of the taps rotate. They don't offer a list of those taps so you have to rely on your server. However, your server won't know jack sh!t about beer so you're on your own. Just walk around and look at tap handles and do your own research. Nothing too impressive.  As for food, meh. Stick to pub fare - wings, burgers - and it probably won't suck. Order the ribeye here and... well, you deserve it (my co-worker ate 1/3 of his and discarded the rest.)

Beer (and better food) lovers, find Duckworth's. For *they* are Charlotte's legit \"Ale House\"."}
{"text":"You know when you try to give fairly new restaurants a break.... well visit number four is my limit. The absolute worst service. Even after talking to a manager I don't want a free meal I want good customer service. My last visit."}
{"text":"My five stars speaks little for the quality of food, as I was lucky enough to frequent the establishment as a bar patron. The selection of beer is refreshing to say the least, but the true gem of this tavern goes by the name Kevin. This guy has truly mastered the art. He'll speak to you long enough to convince you of his true concern for your petty problem and run along to befriend every other customer. Sit at the bar if you have the opportunity. It is truly the best seat in the house."}
{"text":"Really not impressed. Our waiter was the worst - couldn't understand him due to mumbling, didn't see how our food was after we got it (until we were done) and we had to flag him down to get refills on our drinks. He was more concerned with flirting with the girls at the bar. Also, our wings were cold so we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Carolina Ale house. We had a waitress who was really nice. We were from out of the area and she took the time to tell us some of the good places to go to have a decent time that night. All of the food I had was pretty good for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"1 star is too generous. Honestly. Start to finish this is one of the worst restaurant experiences. Ever. We waited longer than necessary for a table -- when several empty tables were available. Our server took forever to take our order, to bring drinks, never offered to refill drinks, etc. 

Then the meals came. Well, some of them came. 3 of our meals did not make it to the table until well after the rest of the people at the table had finished eating and we were ready for the check. Then, when the meals FINALLY made it to the table, it was obvious that the meals had been waiting in the kitchen for a substantial amount of time. One meal was completely inedible. 
One could argue that the server forgot -- but we sought out our server twice to ask about the meals and he said \"I don't know. The kitchen is backed up.\" For a salad. And mac & cheese. But the steak made it to the table in time? Suspect. 
I don't like leaving bad reviews for restaurants, but Ale House earned this one. Try another place."}
{"text":"First time at this location. The fried pickles and the Pub Burger was awesome. Wife had the Brisket sandwich with Au jus and it melted in my mouth. The service was great and the atmosphere just as good. Great place to chill out and enjoy an affordable great tasting meal."}
{"text":"To begin our nachos took 25 minutes to come out and there was aluminum foil rolled up in them. The nachos were missing sour cream and guac plus the cheese was cold and that was just the appetizer.
My salmon Caesar salad was extremely short on lettuce but luckily the salmon was a decent size. My girlfriend ordered a veggie burger pub style and they added bacon.... Seriously it's a veggie burger why would they add bacon!
I assume these issues arrived due to the fact the initial server didn't write anything down. After we placed our orders the server got into an argument with another server and went home. Luckily Steven took care of us and tried to do his best to fix what he kitchen and initial server messed up.

With all this it makes me question the quality of the  management. If there is an issue meet the table and resolve it and make sure the table is happy."}
{"text":"We were there for a bachelorette party and waited two hours for food even with reservations,  food arrived cold or not at all, or was the wrong food.  The manager was less than helpful in resolving the issue. Don't go."}
{"text":"Ribs were the worst I've ever had. Service was terrible. The only reason I gave it two stars is that I didn't have to wait to get seated and the beer list was ok."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after flying into Charlotte from Boston and it is your average bar/restaurant with salads, burgers and sandwiches. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Salad which was your basic salad with tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, red onions and fried chicken tender strips.  It was very simple and tasty since I was very hungry. I had a ranch dressing with it and I had no complaints.  My two colleagues ordered sandwiches and they liked it, no complaints either. Though they did think it was odd that they didn't serve sweet potato fries.

In any case, service was good and this place was ok."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed over all. Only bright side was our server Tiffany was nice and prompt. Nachos came out somewhat warm. The burger I had was over cooked and I asked for medium rare. The ey messed up my drink order and forgot part of our order. Won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Walked in and we were sat immediately. However, we were sat at a disgusting table that was not wiped down. The hostess picked up the check still sitting on the table for the waiter/waitress and no one wiped our table! Food crumbs and whatever else still present and she just put the menus down! We were going to ask to just have someone wipe down the table until we witnessed another table in the same section being cleared of plates and cups but STILL NOT WIPED DOWN! We decided to leave and not be rude but just say something to the manager before we left as I witnessed her clearing the second table and it not being wiped down. We just mentioned it and how gross it was especially for a newer establishment in the area and she said ok and acted like it wasn't a big deal. So please be aware of this before eating here, especially this time of year when the flu is going around and people are sick."}
{"text":"Decent chain place, very pretty setting outside and space for ppl with kiddos on the front lawn. The food is good, lots of choices, better than expected and a good beer list. Cool patio bar and convenient location. Our waiter tonight, Byron, was excellent and exceeded expectations by far for a chain pub - great service and personality. We will be back..."}
{"text":"We are visiting charlotte this weekend and stopped into the ale house for lunch. The service was very friendly and quick. We did not feel rushed at all even though they were experiencing a huge rush of lunchtime service. We started with calamari which was decent. The fry to calamari ratio was a little off but the Thai chili dipping sauce was good. I ordered the London broil sandwich and coleslaw. The coleslaw was great - hardly and mayo and good amount of caraway seed. The London broil was shaved thin and rubbed heavily in monterray steak seasoning. It was very tender which was impressive given how thin it was. My partner got the fish tacos which were outstanding. Lightly fried with mango salsa and the slaw. The beer list is impressive and it's a great place to watch any game. I wish I was going to be in town for march madness."}
{"text":"The Carolina Ale House was one of the first bars I frequented after relocating to Charlotte, NC. The food is as good as bar food gets, flavorful hot chicken wings, a plethra of beers to choose from as well as good cocktail drinks. I recommend the panther bowl, really good mixed drink and big too! I have been there too many times to count but definetly recommend to anyone looking for drinks, eats and a good atmostophere."}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter and a couple of friends for dinner, the food was good. Service was average, but the drinks were not very good at all. I asked for a frozen margarita and it was more like a snow cone. Literally no alcohol, just a lot of shaved ice."}
{"text":"UPDATE: SERVICE SUCKS!! Hostess doesn't smile, looks like she's annoyed at your requests. The servers don't bring you what you ask for and we had to get it ourselves.  The food is always delicious and fresh, but service and servers are terrible."}

{"text":"Have had horrible food  in the past here but we went a couple of months ago and it was ok but we had to wait 45 minutes for our food.  So unfortunately I decided to test my luck and go again.  It started off bad when we ordered tall  beers and when they came one was missing at least 4 oz... I dont expect it to the top but  oh my God it was barely to the top of the handle.  Couldn't find our waitress to complain. We ordered cheese curds as an Appetizer along with a Carolina Dipper to share.   They brought the meal out first so we told the gentleman, as our waitress was not around to cancel the curds.  She came by and we told her we canceled it and she didn't even try to make it right she just said OK.  When I went to take a bite of my sandwich it was FULL OF FAT.  It really was disgusting.  Never ever will I give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Good food,  great atmosphere and service.  We had a party of 10 with kids and were well taken care of.  Huge beer selection."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or 4 times now and this place is kind of just your average modern sports bar with the prerequisite huge beer selection and walls of TVs. The food is ok as is the service. Nothing not to like but, nothing that really makes it stand out either."}
{"text":"My first experience! Great location! Lack luster atmosphere! Horrible Food and bad drinks, but they have a nice selection of beers. Service was not great, but not horrible.  First, we had the wings.  They were extremely tasty, until we bit into and under cooked one(in there defense the wing was abnormally large and the rest of the wings were cooked to perfection). No big deal! They were taken off the bill! I then got the salmon, I ordered it medium.  It was very dry and lacked flavor, upon the first bite.  I had taken the salmon meal to go, by the time I got back and realized the quality of the food, the restaurant was closed! Go back the next day and I exchange the salmon for ribs.  After all, they are known for there bbq and the sauce on the wings was delicious.  I inform the manager and let him know that I will be driving 20 minutes to come exchange the food. They do not offer me a refund and I get the food and ribs are dry and slightly burnt.  The beans were a tad better than the night before. Still not good quality of food. I'm surprised because the location is great! Its a shame because the wings, I may consider going back for!"}
{"text":"Round 1.
I had a gift card to Carolina ale house and I wanted to give it a shot. I really wanted to like it as well, but unfortunately they disappointed. When you first walk in it looks like a typical chain sports bar restaurant. Which I like so I was excited. We were meeting another couple there so we had a four top. To start off service was slow. Which I can deal with for the most part. But what really got to me was our dinner. We ordered three salads and a pulled pork entr√©e. This took almost an hour to get after ordering. To make matters worse the three salads came out but not my entr√©e. My food did not come out for another 20 minutes after. At this point everyone else at the table was already finished eating. The manager offered to pay for my meal and packed it up to go. This was very disappointing especially because I walked into the restaurant hungry in an hour and a half later I leave with a meal to go. Since we were on our way out for a night on the town. I took the meal to go and gave it to a cold homeless couple on the streets. They were very thankful and I ended up getting something else at our next stop. I hope they really get it together over there at the alehouse it looks like a nice place.

Round 2.
I gave ale house a second try. I'm not sure what's going on over here but there is clearly a disconnect with the staff.  The first time the service was really slow, the second time it was too fast. Asking us about Desert while we were still eating. And then brought our check over before we finished dinner. The food was good this time but we felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"I do understand that this is a new restaurant and most have to work out their kinks in a few months of opening, but based on my experience and what appears to be other reviews (on multiple sites), this place might need a little more help than usual.

We were visiting friends (with 2 kids under 5) and decided to check this place out early on a Saturday. We arrived around 5:15, only to find there to be a giant line out the door. This could be good or bad, depending on how the restaurant is. We were quoted at a 45 minute wait time, kind of long for kids but took the risk in that the wait would be shorter than 45 mins.

We decided to wait outside, and my friend made a comment that they will need some sort of fans if they want people to enjoy that area in the hot NC summer. Totally agree, and out of the whole outdoor space, there was not a single fan. Not something super simple to install, but should be considered for future improvements.

45 mins pass, 50 mins pass, it wasn't until 60 mins did we get called to be sat. At that point, the host takes us to the bar side to sit on a 6 person high top table. Um...excuse me, we did say kids and she definitely saw the older one. We had also requested a high chair which apparently was ignored. The host became flustered and went back to find another tablet that we could sit at. Another issue to be addressed, if people have kids, don't sit them in the bar regardless of what is open or what server needs to be sat next.

We finally sat down and were greeted by our server. She took our drink order and we requested that the kid's meal be put in right away so he didn't have to wait any longer to eat. It took over 5 minutes to get 4 glasses of water....water....not beer, not a fancy cocktail....water. This place must clearly be understaffed if it takes that long to get water. She finally returned and seeing this dinner was not going in the positive direction, we made sure to order our food at that time. We put our order in for 2 salads, 1 burger, and one taco app, no additions or changes to what is typically on any of the dishes. 5 minutes later she says the kid's meal will be out, which we thought was awesome, however, it was more like 15 mins later the meal actually arrived. That's 20 mins for a kid's meal that is no bigger than an appetizer.

At this point we are all super hungry, on the verge of hangry. It wasn't until approximately an hour later did we actually receive our meals. WAY. TOO. LONG. I can eat an 8 course meal in 90 mins but can't get simple burgers and salads in under 25... The food was decent, but nothing to wow us or our friends and make them recommend to others that they come check the place out. Half way into eating, the manager comes by to check to see how we are doing. The way he asked made it seem like he was surprised that we didn't have any complaints. We're hungry, yes we have complaints, but would rather eat and not prolong the dinner anymore.

It also took us about 15 more minutes to get our check. While I'm not sure if you can place any blame on the server since she was running back and forth....but the place should not even be open if you are that understaffed. Hire extra, it's much easier to staff back than hope that others will apply. 

Note that it is also extremely loud in the place so expect to have to shout to the people across the table."}
{"text":"We had a \"new\" server named Taylor tonight it was an overall bad experience. For starters, she didn't know anything about the drink specials and walked away to ask someone else. We are all servers so we do understand however, she had a very bad attitude and walked away while one person was in the middle of ordering. A new person joined our table and she never once came back to ask if he wanted something, we had to flag her down. Every time we asked for something she made it seem like an inconvenience. Not knowing the menu and drink menu is one thing but it's another to be just plain rude."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. Unfortunately, we had a server in training during normal busy dinner hours, but she was backed by a very experienced trainer. All the food was great. Only four stars because my burger was dry/over cooked."}
{"text":"Got the wings here.  Wings were as large as I've ever gotten (dwarfs Quaker Stake and Buffalo Wild Wings).  They were very fairly priced and filling, nice bargain.  They aren't a \"wing\" restaurant so they obviously don't have tons of different sauces, maybe 6 at the most.  The honey buffalo was very interesting and tasty.  They also have grilled wings, very tasty.  

The beer menu is very robust, almost as if they copied Flying Saucer...even the beer menus look verrrry similar.  They had many large screen tv's with sports, comfortable booths, and attractive waitresses.  I would definitely eat there again but its a little loud for a \"date\" place.  There were a lot of Harley Davidson yuppie wannabees there when I went so don't be scared off if you see a lot of bikes there, the people are harmless.  This place is a nice alternative to other options in the area, should be slam packed race weeks."}
{"text":"Service was good.
Lots of beer taps but they were out of a lot of them. ON A Saturday night!! 
It was cold(temp).
Apparently you can screw up wings(twice) and Guinness"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great American Sports Bar look  no further. I highly recommend Carolina Ale House. Really great atmosphere and lots of tv's to watch your favorite sports team. I went with a group of friends. We were taken care off by the staff at the hostesses stand and they made sure we got an outside table. Great selection of drinks, Appetizers, Entr√©e's and desserts. Great service, very clean and Great Food. If I am ever back in Charlotte, North Carolina I certainly will return to the Carolina Ale House. Carolina Ale House certainly rates five stars and more."}
{"text":"It is FunkFest weekend and we all wanted something to eat different from the normal Waffle House. We tried this place since we are from out of town. This was the worst experience with food that I have ever had. We had to seat ourselves which was no problem but the waitstaff just walked by us. It was about 3 people on the staff that walked by until my friend got up to talk to someone. When she went to talk to someone that acted like she was bothering them but they would be over. She asked again and then an extremely apologetic young lady (Riana) came to take our order. Tyler a tall gentleman with a buzz cut and a long haired young lady Lauren were asked why they didn't help me and they just shrugged Riana off. These 2 people were extremely rude and off of that I would not back. Riana was the best under the circumstances since these 2 wait stay were not helping her with tables at all. Late night this is not the place for you. This place left a bad taste in my mouth and we have one at home and I am not sure about trying that one"}
{"text":"Heard this place opened up and decided to give this new location a try. Love the location! Everything is close by and there is tons of shopping in the Waverly development.  The place is decorated with sports memorabilia and other sports themed decor. The bar and dining area are separated by a wall, so whether you're there for dinner or just grabbing a few brews...there is a place for you. Clearly, its an establishment geared towards sports. So I bet this place will be great for game day! Now onto the food.  To start we had the flatbread. I thought it was too salty and we  had only one slice. Secondly, I ordered the Turkey Wrap. It was okay. Didn't much care for the wrap used. My side was the salad and I wasn't a fan of that either. Lettuce looked a day too old as it didn't have that fresh crunch I was looking for. My friend had the blackened Tuna salad and had the same thing to say about the lettuce. He also mentioned that his Tuna was not cooked the way he asked for it to be but he still enjoyed it.  He did say that he was impressed with how much tuna they give you for the price.  And finally service.  This is where most of their stars are coming from. Service was outstanding! Our server Sasha was great! She made a connection with our table and gave out a few recommendations. She was attentive without overdoing it. I wasn't a fan of the food but I did like the environment and could see myself here for a happy hour or to catch a game."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tons of beers on tap and they're sure to include all the local breweries features too! Great place to watch a game or meet for a few drinks after work. Cornhole out back and covered patio that is nice to hang out too. Best place on concord mills Blvd."}
{"text":"I came here a couple times. So close to NBEO. Right across the street

- Order a pound cake. Irish cream bombs!
- Mozzarella sticks tastes like its from Costco.  
- Zingers comes with Blue cheese? LOL..Is this a Charlotte thing?
- On a Friday night, too busy. Wait is 45min to 1hour for a table! Just go to the bar.."}
{"text":"A nice space to watch multiple games being that ESPN, NFL Network, MLB Network, etc are always on. The food is average but they have a nice selection of beers on tap. Although it's a chain, Carolina Ale House in Fort Mill works. It won't blow your socks off, but it serves its purpose"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family. It was a party of 4 and we were promptly sat at a booth near the bar area. Very clean, very friendly staff! The waiter was awesome and very attentive to our drinks. We ordered the Nachos with pork and the waiter suggested trying them half and half with chicken and pork. Great up sale and he was spot on! They were to die for amazing!  We all tried the Chicken Zingers in either Honey Buffalo or the Sweet and sour Buffalo and WOW they were cooked perfectly and the flavors were outstanding!  Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Carolina Ale Houses but this by far was my worst experience. Came in was seated fairly quickly. The restaurant wasn't busy but I'm thinking from the service it was severely understaffed. Received our drinks and waited longer than usual for our waitress to come back and take our order. When we finally ordered we waited another 20 minutes with no one checking on us or offering any refills. We considered walking to the bar to get a refill for tea. Couldn't be terribly busy as we saw a lot of chatting behind the register station. What was more disheartening was the manager never checked on anyone and instead stood upfront talking to someone he knew. I really had my heart set on some wings but there was no way we could put up with that service any longer. I see several reviews like this...management see a problem?????"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  We had a sampler ap. I had the prime rib- rare.  It was recommended by Thurston, our server. Excellent taste and seasoned well.  Thurston was great. Right on point! Thanks for an awesome bday meal!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a good while and continually received poor service. I complained to management and was told that they were working on it. Sure enough, my last couple visits have been excellent. Great service, and as always amazing wings, burgers, and beers. Great for watching any game."}
{"text":"Great beer selection but horrible service!!! Took forever to get drink refills. So bad that the people sitting beside us asked is there some one else helping...look around at the bar and everyone's glasses are empty."}
{"text":"I Came twice while visiting North Carolina, the first was on the day of the super bowl, even though the bar was super packed for the big event, I found the way to find a little spot at the bar.
Their selection of beers is really good. I first time I see the White IPA Blue Moon on tap and it was very cool and have a good taste.

For my food, I order the BBQ & buffalo wings was on point as well as the bacon cheese fries were tasty! The dish came very quickly considering that the place was crowded."}
{"text":"It's a typical franchise sports bar/restaurant. Our waitress, Renee, was awesome. She has a radiant personality and was quick with our orders. As a vegetarian, I'm always happy when I find these type of establishments having more options for me other than appetizers. These options allow mr to hang out with my carnivorous friends in a comfortable environment. The burger was great. The sweet potatoes fries are excellent with a great sauce. I'm not a sports bar type of person but I do enjoy the Alehouse franchise."}
{"text":"80+ beers on tap... Tons and tons of space.. Upstairs and downstairs.. Multiple bars..  Large menu..

Yeah this place is just what I like.  Nothing really stands out as unique but the menu is A-OK.  I've had the wings (B-) and the chicken bbq sandwich (B+) and the fried pickles (C).  The pickles are better at other places but nothing can really beat this location (right next to the Epicentre) and the space.  Something about not being cramped when its crowded is rather nice.  It is a great place to meet up after work or watch the Bobcats/Panthers.  Honestly, you can't go wrong here.. You will leave happy.  Enjoy!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"Service has been pretty good.  Onion rings, cheese fries, wings, and burgers have all been good.  Decent beer selection"}
{"text":"First time at this location. The Brisket Sandwich was excellent. We were served in a timely manner by a very pleasant young man. They had a great selection of food and drink. The prices were a little high for beer but the food prices were less so it balanced out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came today for lunch. First off parking was horrid, secondly the service was very slow and the bartender didn't come around to often...  the bar wasn't close to busy. Secondly as I was sitting at the bar I observed a women not sure if she was the manager or expiditer. She wasn't in uniform and a little heavy set. I counted 10 times she had her hands in her mouth and about 20+ times touching her necklace and readjusting her shirt. I've been in the industry my whole entire and this completely unacceptable. I will never nor come here again or recommend. Good luck.."}
{"text":"Really slow service. Everyone seemed to run around like chickens with their heads cut off. I didn't think the glass should touch the tap, but what do I know? The wings were ok. The Carolina bbq was greasy ? How does that happen?"}
{"text":"This was a place I'd liked to go to....  I appreciate a nice time at a restaurant, take time to converse and enjoy a meal with friends and family.  The service was the absolute WORST.  Ordered drink, didn't bring all the drinks, came back to take order for food, still had no drinks.  Got two drinks, 2 salad entrees, then two more entrees, then kids meal then drinks, then last two meals, so much for food arriving and eating at same time... guess what? No napkins or forks, finally brought 7 for party of 9.  We came tail end of lunch hour... left @3pm?!?!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to this location a number of times, and each time it's the same experience... lousy.

We are the type of people who prefer to sit at the bar and every time, it's taken anywhere from 10-20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the bartender.

I worked in the restaurant industry all through college and we were always taught to acknowledge new customers, even if you can't take their order right then - something like \"Hey there! I'll be with you in just a minute\". Apparently that is not something taught or enforced here.

Our visit last night was the same as all the others. We were not acknowledged, or even looked at, by any of the bartenders for at least 10 minutes. When we finally ordered our drinks, the bartender had to come back to be reminded what we ordered. We decided to order our food right away since we didn't know the next time we would have their attention. The app came fairly quickly, but our meal took forever. When we finally received it, my boyfriend was missing his side, which we had to remind them they were supposed to be, 20 minutes later.

Not sure we will be returning again."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Burger cooked perfectly and pizza was yummy! Stopped in randomly and thought it was gong to be an average sports bar but was so much better!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed. We had been to the uptown location and it was amazing. We were super excited for this location. One time we went and a person in our party never even got their meal. The manager apologized and said he was going to \"Get to the bottom of it.\" We never heard back from him. Another time, we got the nachos and the pork on them was horrible. Our server did take them off the bill. Just ok, guess maybe they need more time to iron out the kinks but it was disappointing after our uptown experience."}
{"text":"Popped in to kill sometime before a movie at the mall with friends. The hostess told us they didn't have any booths available, despite the fact I could see six empty booths? I asked her who was sitting at those, and she said the section was closed? I'm sorry, but is it that difficult for a waitstaff person to step 3 feet to the left to take an order? After getting ornery about it she gave in and set us there begrudgingly. Not a good start.

Waitress comes over takes drink orders, promptly brings them then disappears for 15 minutes. We finally put in an order for an appetizer which comes out greasy and inedible. The appetizer was delivered by a runner from the kitchen....50 minutes in the bar and we never saw our waitress again. 

Terrible service, terrible food, never gain. I know Carolina Ale House as a brand can do a lot better, this location needs to re-evaluate their staff training, management, and strategy."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch a game. Probably not good if you don't have a lot of time. I've been to this location several times and they are consistently inconsistent. The servers seem unknowledgeable about the menu and they run out of things often. Great beer selection but they last time I was there, 3 of my first choice beers were out and two of my bf's choices were out too. Good burgers, wings and the shrimp tacos are delicious. I don't recommend the fish tacos.

Clean place with good food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just ate here and was served food with no utensils or napkins. Had to wave the waitress down to get any. And waitress then proceeded to play a round of pool - she didn't even check on us. Will not return!!"}
{"text":"I've been this particular place a few times. Tonight was a bit odd. It was a Sunday night. I went to the bar to order a beer. Since I was going to sit at a table, instead of the bar, I had to be served by the waiter. So, a delay in my cold beverage.  So, I was thirsty enough to want another beer. So I told the bartender. She opened my beer but couldn't give it to me although I was right there at the bar, a mere three feet away from her. I instead had to wait at my table for another three minutes so my waiter could bring it to be. Stupid protocol.

So, I had a sweet tooth and desired a CAB Mud Pie. Of course they were out of them.  So, I deferred to the Homemade Apple Cobbler. The description was awesome. The product not so much. Melted ice cream over a mess of applesauce and other not so tasty filler. Avoid at all costs. Remove it from your menu and change your beverage delivery protocol... Please. This was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went for lunch mid-week while in town for business. Our server was super friendly but overall service was really slow. I would give it two stars but our server was so nice and the food was really good. We had the Carolina pork sandwich and the Carolina version of a French dip. Both very good. I was just disappointed in how slow it was."}
{"text":"It's a chain and pub food so food is okay nothing to rave about but the service was completely unacceptable. Given the fact it was a busy day with football. Our waitress was not only inattentive and disrespectful yet repeatedly messed up our orders. Very chill crew that I was with. We didn't say anything to her about her attitude and short temper ( I know things go south in life so I hope everything is ok) but dam even a smile would have been nice."}
{"text":"Ooooooh Carolina Ale House, how you have been good and bad to me on my few visits (hence the 3 stars).

First, I will start with the \"not so great, but I haven't given up on you yet items\". For one, BRING A JACKET/SWEATER/COAT!!! Yes, I am yelling that because it is cold in there and the air blows EVERYWHERE:  Left, right, up, down, under the table, over the table, on your food, and on your face, arms, and legs. So, listen to me on that and you will thank me later. Next, the food here is hit or miss depending on what you order. The items I have tried so far and would not recommend would be the following:  Pepperoni pizza (way too greasy, too much cheese), BBQ pork ribs (tender but the sauce was not that good), Baked beans (I've had better), and the Carolina Ale House fries (Hmmmmmm never again will I order them). The last thing that I didn't like nor did I understand was why there was loud music playing over the speakers  throughout the restaurant and not any of the football games. This is a sports bar right??? They need to change that ASAP!

Well, that's enough about the \"bad\" things, let's move on to the \"just when I was about to give up on this place, these items saved it\" items. First, there are TV's EVERYWHERE in the restaurant, so no matter what angle you are sitting at, a tv will be in your line of sight. All sporting events were playing the night I went and I loved it! This is a great place to come to watch any game you want and to have drinks. Next, now I know there were some food items that I didn't approve of, but there are a few I would definitely recommend. The burgers here are to die for! They are thick and juicy and very tasty. Their wings are really good too and I have gotten them each time I've gone and shared them with everyone at my table and they all have loved them too. Finally the spinach dip here is by far the best spinach dip I have ever had and will always get it as an appetizer when I go. Finally, the service here has been great every time I've gone and the managers have been visible and checked on me and my party each time, which is greatly appreciated. 

I can't finish this review without mentioning the LARGE selection of draft beer they have. Now, I am not much of a beer drinker, but those of you who are well, Carolina Ale House is where you need to be!

I will definitely be returning here, but only for the wings, burgers, and sports (if the sound is turned on for games)!"}
{"text":"Typical local hangout bar. The atmosphere is great- sports fans everywhere and TVs on every wall. The drinks are cheap but very good. The food is cheap but also does not taste that good. I ordered the spicy buffalo zingers, but it wasn't spicy at all. And actually a bit too salty"}
{"text":"Consistently poor food. The beer is good and it's a good place to hang out, but the food has always been lousy. Too bad."}
{"text":"It kinda sucks schweaty balls....

The one and only reason that I ever come here is because it's a block from my office making it convenient for Friday happy hour.  Other than that, this place is a Zero.  

They never, EVER, have the beer that order.  I've started giving the waitress 3 beers, in order of preference, assuming that a couple of beers that are one the menu will not be available.  It's annoying and the service blows.  The food sub par bar crap and the atmosphere could not be more generic.  Unless you enjoy really crappy bars, avoid this place."}
{"text":"I walked to eat from the Marriott next door. Despite the bad reviews I still tried.
Well, I waited 10 minutes at the table and no one came to take my drink order. So I went to smash burgers, btw it was great.
Ale house was not busy at all. Most of the people at the bar. The wait staff or whatever was hanging out at the front door. About 5 people just standing around.
Don't waste your time.."}
{"text":"It's an excellent sports bar. There are so many TVs. There's a lot of space. The food is average to above. It's nice how it is out by a pond. If you're looking for a place to watch the game or to grab a sit down dinner that's better than an Applebees you should come here."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on occasion while passing through the Concord Mills area. I love the craft beer selection but the pint prices are a little high. The food is decent, not the best but far from bad. I have had some servers who have been great and others that were horrible. I guess its just luck of the draw. All in all its a decent place to eat and catch a game on one of the many tvs."}
{"text":"lots of tvs, lots of beers, lots of bar space.
a decent (two storied) addition to the uptown sports bar scene, downstairs is filled with tables, a large bar, and plenty of screens, below an upstairs with a smaller bar, some tables, even more tvs, a pool table, and some games. 

My first night there we stayed downstairs at the bar. Every game we wanted to see was on (baseball and football) and there was definitely a great energy level. The main issue was halfway down the bar some patrons were smashing dishes at what started out as baseball errors (or so we were told by a bartender) and then escalated to whenever they felt like smashing a glass into the well of the bar. I'm not really sure why the bar staff was putting up with the constant glass shrapnel (followed by the need to sweep) especially since a few were almost hit themselves, but it went on the whole time we were there. Also, the drinks seemed fairly weak and overly sweet (even a switch to a diet mixer didn't help) luckily, they have lots of beer!

My second visit we sat upstairs and it started out quieter, but as the evening progressed it definitely picked up. (I loved the TVs mounted on the support beams right next to the table.) We had some problems accessing the wireless and after thirty minutes of \"try this password, okay well then try this password\" the manager finally apologized, said the system must be down, and that he'd cover our beers for the trouble. Completely unnecessary, but we were happy with the offer, ordered some food, and continued to watch the games. After noshing a bit we decided to play a game of pool (maybe 15 feet from our table), and amidst the game looked up to find that our table was being cleared (although we had left some personal items, some food we were still snacking on, and drinks) and a new party was being sat down at it. Our server caught it too late, post unnecessary tongue lashing from the hostess for not clearing her own table. Again we received apologies and a promise to cover a round, and we continued to play pool. Eventually when we decided to close out (after it took forever to find our server as she had so many tables) we find out nothing was comped and I'm still fairly certain we were charged for an extra beer we didn't even order. That being said we just wanted to get out of the place and move on with our evening, so we paid and left. 

There are places I'd visit before returning to the ale house again, but with its TVs, beer selection, and decent specials, I'm sure I'll find myself there again... I just won't be expecting much."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a drink after seeing a concert at the Tim Cable Arena, we weren't expecting much but our waitress seemed as if us being there was a more inconvience than anything else. We planned on just ordering drinks and after telling our waitress that she barely acknowledged us seeming frusturated. 

I don't spend a lot of time in Charlotte but if I do come back to see a concert at the arena I will probably skip getting a drink here and head back to the hotel."}
{"text":"Not the old Carolina Ale House I was used to a year or so ago. 

Thankfully we were seated very quickly for a Saturday evening. It was an unseasonably warm day and I guess they didn't think to adjust the temperature as it was very warm inside and patrons were using menus as fans. Staff didn't get the hint. 

Our waitress started off rather friendly then things took a turn for some reason. 

While waiting for our friends, hubby and I ordered a \"double \" of our favorite brew, Angry Orchard on draft. Hubby later complained of his wrist being sore from holding it! It's pretty large. 

No appetizers tonight. I remembered the burgers being great. Despite decreasing my red meat consumption, I figured I would try one tonight remembering how good they were when we used to come frequently. I should have ordered shrimp or the fried chicken salad. My medium well burger was dry and probably someone's well done burger by mistake. The fries were still good like I remembered. They are hearty but not wedges. 

Our waitress lost steam about midway through dinner and seemed a tad irritated. Not sure what that was about. 

In a word: meh. Hopefully the location opening closer to us will stir the nostalgic feeling I had for Carolina Ale House."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with some colleagues and we had a great time and a good meal. Everyone ordered something different and all gave a thumbs up . I ordered the Zinger Mac N Cheese just because I wanted something that you can't order somewhere else. This was absolutely delicious and even though when it arrived I thought it was kind of small, I was unable to finish it. Our waiter was super nice and checked on us frequently. 

One of my colleagues order a glass of the house white wine which they were out of. That's not good to hear. Then another ordered the baked Salmon and by the time he received it, the rest of us were halfway through our dinner. We did get fried pickles or Frickles as an appetizer and to be honest, they weren't that good. That weren't battered properly and some were undercooked.

Overall it was a good experience and this isn't my first meal at a Carolina Ale House and it definitely won't be my last. However, I do wish they had more selections of steak."}
{"text":"Food was good. Beer choices are plentiful and many are $3 pints on Wednesday. 

Service is poor. They don't know that there should be a delay between the appetizer and the entree. 

Lots of tv's, but they also play blaring music. 

Big hangout for after work groups, couples/double dates, and older single guys."}
{"text":"Prime time location for your after work happy hours, the Carolina Ale house has plenty of seating enveloped in sports TVs or even outdoors on their patio, which comes with a nice street level view for people watching.

Typical bar with typical bar food of typical quality.  The staff is less than attentive and I've been dissappointed with the level of urgency, quality and service on multiple occasions.  Seems like we get a trainee every time we're there, so turnover has got to be a real problem.  That said, no way it should take as long as it does to simply take an order on a new guest and get them a beer.

The prices are also less than ideal as a bottle of beer can easily top $5 and are often in the $6-$7 range depending on your choice of suds.

There's literally a dozen classier, better serviced, sports friendly watering holes within a two block radius - this wouldn't be the first place I'd suggest heading after a long day of work in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Where to begin. Food got to the table before beer. Once beer arrived 10 minutes later( due to ticket being thrown away ) wrong beer. Manager witnessed and did nothing about it. Opening day but not busy at all if they can't handle this many people. I would hate to see them slammed."}
{"text":"This bar/pub was supposed to be a welcome addition to the neighborhood. However, after a few successful lunches  for business since it opened I took my family there for Father's Day and was disappointed to say the least. The bacon cheese fries I ordered were old and barely warm the first time and after being replaced were scorched and the fries still old. The burger I had was barely warm the first time it arrived at the table and adequate the after being remade. Sweet potato fries were good, but only after being sent back when they arrived cold the first time. Obviously, there is an issue with the kitchen staff not providing good QA/QC of the food prior to service. Hopefully, this gets fixed otherwise CAH will miss the opportunity to make their mark on the area. 

Service was satisfactory and I really enjoy their beer selections. I'll be back, but consider yourself on notice for repeat business."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite before a show.  Been to other Carolina Ale Houses in the Carolinas and it was the same.  Food was good enough.  Service was good.  Menu is same as any sports bar.  Grilled wings are good."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have attempted to try Carolina Ale House.  I met my wife on the way home from work, we arrived around 5PM before a crowd was there and were seated immediately.  I placed a beer order that arrived quickly, then everything went down hill.  We placed an order for some pretzel bites, and my wife added on some cheese dip with it.  While we waited for them, another table was seated near us.  We then waited...and waited some more, and watched a server place some appetizer dishes and napkins on the table next to us.  Our Pretzels came out, glistening in butter, they were placed on the table by the Flash I assume, as the pretzels seemed to show up without any .  But we had nothing to eat them with - no silverware, plates, just hot pretzels.  We waited over 5 minutes to find someone to ask for some plates - it was our server asking how they were...  In total - 8 minutes went by from the time the pretzels came to when we got plates.  

Lets fast forward to 630pm.  Still no food, and my beer has long been gone.  We flag down our server, who finally goes and gets the food that has most likely been waiting for us and brings it to the table.  My wife's sandwich was not what she ordered.  My kids mac+cheese wasn't just warm, it was cold.  And my grilled Tuna sandwich that was ordered medium was hard as a rock.  It's now 7pm.  

After speaking to the manager who seemed to care little about anything, I told my wife I was done.  My kid who was eating his fruit kept my wife there while they tried to bring out a correct order.  I told my wife I was heading home and I would see her there and grabbed a McDonald's frozen patty - which made this entire experience even worse.

It's a shame since the food looked decent and the inside setup, while EXTREMELY noisy, is a nice layout for sports with a good beer list.  But, the entire operation lacks any sort of order - like it's run by headless chickens.  They might want to try poaching someone from a successful place that keeps their people in working in a good order."}
{"text":"I think got sick from this restaurant. I should have  known when the boneless chicken wings came out ice cold that they had probably been sitting out a long time. Service not good, she dropped my food and left to go get me utensils and took long time to just get me a fork. Caesar salad had brown lettuce and was swimming in dressing. Never again."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time service sucked and food sucked worse. Went again tonight for a second shot. Worse than the first time.  Don't waste your time or money here unless you like disappointment."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar food with a good beer selection. I always liked the one uptown so we tried this one and were impressed. It's probably a 3.5 out of 5 but bumping to four as it's still new. I will be visiting again. I wonder if they will have NFL Sunday ticket?"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. The outside bar and furniture outside are great but the service is awful . One of the worst bartender experience I ever witnessed . Won't be back . Hopefully they change some major service issues ."}
{"text":"We came here to watch the NC state game last week. It was an ok experience, nothing impressive. The place was packed. The server took forever to bring a chair over, had to grab one myself. 

I ordered the shrimp tacos which took a while to bring out, ok considering the crowded. The tacos themselves were on the sweet side, good but I would have liked some chili. The rice that accompanied the tacos was terrible! It was so badly burnt that I couldn't eat it. The mango habanero zingers my boyfriend ordered were delicious, I ended up nibbling on some of those too. Great balance of spicy and sweet! 

I would come back during happy hour to grab a beer and some wings! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Very good wings with all the ranch needed! Ribs were generous and well prepared.  Nachos and spinach dip were excellent.  Very good service and location at Waverly. Walk is exceptional.....very family friendly and pedestrian friendly.  Walk to shop at whole foods after dinner!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Great food and they have 72 taps! I had the veggie burger with fries, which was excellent. I would totally go back there again!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the stop based one hundred percent on the selection of brews. Over 70 taps that run the gamut from rare to common and local to all over the land. I was staying at a hotel next door and had time for a beer to wind down after a busy evening and figured I would give them a shot. A friend of mine told me about the local Cocoa Loco from NoDa. I saw that they had it on tap and had to give it a try.

I wasn't there long and I didn't eat, but from what I observed the service was great and the selection was unbelievable. I look forward to trying more on my next trip."}
{"text":"Food here has been great every time I've been. Only complaints is parking and how loud it can get in there at times. I practically had to scream to talk to my friends sitting right across the table from me. I prefer the outdoor area whenever I can sit out there. The outdoor bar is a nice place to grab a drink while waiting on your table."}
{"text":"This place was decent.  Nothing to write home about or make you run back for more.  Food was ok, service wasn't terrible but definitely slow.  Nothing great about the experience but they did have a good beer selection.  Loud place, average food, bar prices... meh"}
{"text":"Yikes. This place definitely needs some improvement. Our service was awful.

When we arrived we were sat and put our drink orders in no problem. Shortly after she came back to ask for our order. I asked if there was an option for a soup and salad or soup and sandwich combo. She looked at our 6 person table, muttered to herself, and then walked back to the hostess stand to get one lunch menu--we didn't even know this was an option as she didn't originally give us one at 1pm on a Tuesday. She placed one lunch menu in front of me and proceeded to try to get my order, I picked something quickly but our entire group was interested in seeing that menu while she was impatiently trying to get the food in. It was just a weird situation, we appreciated getting the order in promptly--but it was lunch time, and we wanted to check out those options too. 

After the order went in the wait was relatively quick for how busy they were--great job to the back of house staff on pumping out orders! However, once our food was dropped off--without silverware--we didn't see our server for over 10 minutes. At this point, one of our party was still waiting on a side of ranch and all of us needed a drink refill (water and tea only). We asked for these items and it took another 5 minutes to see her. 

I understand having a bad day, but it just put a really bad taste in all of our mouths about going back. The food was okay, nothing amazing--but nothing to complain about. Prices were good and the atmosphere is laid-back."}
{"text":"Great food and service 
I had the Spicy Street Tacos  
They were very tasty!
The place just opened and has a very cool outdoor bar with a great view of the lake, also have 100 bears on tap and plenty of TVs"}
{"text":"If the food was as good as our waitress, it would have been fantastic.  Unfortunately, I ordered wings and when I bit into one, it was bloody and raw.  Tried two more...same thing.  Our waitress was very apologetic and got another order for me...but by that time I really was not hungry.  Service was fantastic...food, not so much."}
{"text":"Food was not good . Me and my friend had chicken tenders called chicken zingers mixed with wing sauce . It was nasty the sweet potato fries and French fries were nasty . Another friend got nachos and they were just very thin tortilla chips with a very tiny bit of cheese sauce a huge mountain of lettuce a few tomatoes and pork on top . I even tasted it and we couldn't finish it, super gross. The waiter was great ! He gave us refills a lot and asked if we needed anything often. The service was on point !"}
{"text":"Been twice first time on a rainy night. Was seated at a small table and literally had umbrellas and coats dripping on us. Food was good but appetizer came out 2 seconds before main meal and wait staff was visible annoyed we were not done.  Second time came in late and sat at bat.  3 bartenders and not one came over. Then was told after sitting there bar was closed. I asked why two groups at the bar were still being served shots and beers if closed , I was told they had been there a while and ordered before closing."}
{"text":"I'm not much for sports bars, so take this review with a grain of salt. The food is a-ok. Nothing special. The most important \"value added\" factor of this place is the concentration of professional men in one place (after working hours) and all the big screen tvs. I felt like Carrie Bradshaw in that one episode where she's recommending to her Annex Class students where to find single men in Manhattan."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful here! The greek chicken pizza is the BEST! The chicken quesadilla, spiniach dip, pepporini pizza, and veggie pizza are all really good. You also have to try the dry rub wings, they are soooo yummy! The atmosphere is great. Lots of TVs, two pool tables, big bar inside with high top tables and a few booths. What is also very nice is the patio seating with a second smaller bar. There is plenty of room and cornhole outside. 

The young manager there is fantastic he is always walking around making sure every customer is being helped and are happy. We've always had good servers at the table with dinner.

The absolute worst part of CAH and the reason for the 3 stars and not 5 is directed to one bartender.. let's just say she is WAY less than pleasant. I'm really unsure why she still has a job since you can smell her attitude when you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Food is okay. They don't know how to cook steak or burgers the way a customer asks for. Service is slow."}
{"text":"Three star food but five star service. DeShawn and bartender were both helpful, quick and friendly, even at 1:00 am on Sunday night!! Drink refills and check came quickly :)"}
{"text":"We went there last night and sat outside.  There was garbage all over the floor, wrappers blowing in the wind.  The service was not great-we saw our server 2x in 45-60 minute trip and needed to flag him down to get our bill.

My burger was good, if you like soggy buns.  Who puts lettuce on the bottom, underneath the burger?  My wife's shrimp tacos were gross and she said she'd wished she had sent them back right away.   The lone highlights were the chicken tenders for my kid and spinach dip. 

Good beer selection does not outweigh bad food and bad service.

A one and done for us."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices.   Service can be questionable at times....  Good service on 2 out of 3 visits.   Others complain about food.  While it's not a 5-star white tablecloth restaurant, I don't expect that level of food.  For a sports bar, the food is good."}
{"text":"Went on a tuesday lunch. The food was great the service was fantastic. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It was actually kinda exciting to see this place go up since I have fond memories of it from my days in college in Raleigh.  I may have chosen the worse days to go check this place out - the last time was during \"kids night\" so it was packed and we were trying to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I think the hostess was already frazzled from all the kids, so she wasn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed when we were trying to grab a table for the hour long wait.

Food was okay... nothing special, but nothing bad either.  Decent selections of draft available.  Service was again a little shaky due to the amount of people in there.

Location is tucked way back past Concord Mills on the left in front of Academy Sports.  I am not going to go out of my way to visit this place, but it's definitely worth a try.  Hopefully my next experience is not when it is super busy again."}
{"text":"Second trip to Charlotte and tried the food this time. Solid showing of buffalo wings.  Pleasently surprised at a selection of sauces and cooking methods for a patron that likes choices.

House salad was fresh, crisp, and full of flavor.  Garlic croutons! Yum.

I find most venues have a hard time competing with silicon valley food.  This place keeps pace."}
{"text":"I hate bullies. On you if you choose to support this corporate strong arm after its vicious attacks on a tiny retail beer shop in Atlanta."}
{"text":"This has been my go to lunch spot since it opened last year. Originally it was just the closest restaurant to work, but the regular lunch bartender Liz has done a great job of turning a bunch of us Roush employees into regulars, plus she has been great at recommending choices from the large, and mildly intimidating, draft selection. After the Flying Saucer, Ale House has the best beer selection in town, especially in local brews.  Recommend the turkey guacamole wrap and the dry rub wings for lunch...and probably the only downside is the music can be on the loud side at times."}
{"text":"My happiest check in ever. This was my favorite restaurant while attending NC State and am so happy they have one close to home now. Great atmosphere and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Wow I was so ready to enjoy a flight of dark ales and what sounded like an awesome brisket sandwich, but  after a 25 minute wait we never saw a wait person. Not even a drink order was taken.  I don't even thin the hostess noticed us leave. I may try another location but will never return to this location. Sad. Both the food and beer menus look awesome"}
{"text":"First & foremost: The food was excellent! The Burgers, the wings, as well as the buffalo shrimp salad; all great items on the menu. Now aside from that, the service was horrendous. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because my server had a trainee tagging along. But even she was unpleasant. All the dishes and utensils were stained with dirt as if they jus got a quick cold rinse and put back into use. You have to ask multiple times for refills, napkins, etc. I always enjoyed C.A.H, but this location on concord mills really ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Amazing bar food- try the fish tacos! 72 taps to choose from. Love the atmosphere and the customer service was great- my server was clearly new and very attentive. Went here twice during my 3 day visit to Charlotte. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was ok and our server was luke warm. The atmosphere did not feel very welcoming."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and they've got a great beer selection. They even have a printed beer guide in the menu so you know exactly what each type of beer is before trying something new. It was 1am when we went in but what drew us to this place was that they still have the full menu available. The place was pretty busy and we had to wait a few mins while they got tables ready bc 3 other couples walked in at the same time. It took awhile before anyone came to our table and also for our drinks and food to come out, but other than that no complaints. Great place to visit if you're in town and a Carolina Panthers fan"}
