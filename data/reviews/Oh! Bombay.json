{"text":"Ordered by phone and when we went to pick up, instead if being fresh, food was packed off the buffet. Cold and tasteless. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Fresh food, very well prepared. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning after eating the butter chicken here.  Was not very pleased.  Food was a bit spicy for me and didn't seem super fresh."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one day. This restaurant is very clean and has plasma/HD t'v for the menu and it's all granite and marble.  But my praise really stops hear. The food was just average and it did not taste fresh, everything had a sour taste to it. The naan made it edible. Good prices though, $6.99 for a thaali that had a decent variety. It is set up like a fast food/ takeout joint. It's nice to see the previous reviewer had such a good experience though."}
{"text":"Nice place for quick lunch and that too most of menu under $ 7-8 Try vada pav or pavbhaji ...it's reminds me  of Bombay Wada pav."}
{"text":"I used to be a very loyal customer, as a matter of fact I was there the day after the doors opened for the first time.  Food was tasty but after about the first year of business the owner and staff became completely uninterested in their service and reduced their serving portions. I visited for the last time 4 months ago when my wife said stop going or stop complaining!  Too bad because the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Decent and diverse Indian food and great prices. No, it's no Bombay Bhel, but it's close and also half the price."}
{"text":"Best indian food i have had in gta; service good, food leven better; i go twice a week during the week and at least once a month for the buffet"}
{"text":"I've only had their samosas which are only $0.40 each and comes with sauce.  They were pretty good.  Nice and crispy shell and lots of filling with good flavour.  I will try their thali next time which is priced well at $7 or so."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law suggested some Indian food for lunch the other day, and I happily agreed since I've really only been to every single Chinese place in the vicinity.  The food here is delicious peeps! It's a little hole in the wall, but it's clean and the staff are friendly, and the prices are super reasonable. Food is laid out cafeteria style and you pick and choose your place. The variety of food makes it difficult to pick 3 items for your Thali (I had the non-veg option which included two meat selections and one veg selection with rice / biryani, naan and a drink or dessert for $8). If you have trouble making up your mind, they have an all-you-can-eat option for $12 as well.   I picked the butter chicken, lamb curry, and palak paneer with biryani. The biryani was a bit dry, and the butter chicken a bit dry, but otherwise the food was flavourful and really hit the spot. They had plenty to choose from, but I was craving the staples. The spice level was just right for my mango lassi ($1.50 extra to upgrade the drink).  I brought my little newborn to the place, which worked out okay as there weren't a lot of people dining there on such a rainy day. The single-stall bathroom was clean but wouldn't have helped if I needed to change baby.   Overall, the place is a great find - tucked away in a small strip plaza and silently waiting for more customers. I'm glad I gave them a try and can't wait to go back to sample more food!"}
{"text":"Food is fine, can't say the same about their service. Just 1 person on the counter taking orders and serving at the same time. Plus their buffet system is weird that you have to wait to be served rather than just taking yourself. On top of that the nans take forever. If u add all this up on a busy day you will be eating cold food"}
{"text":"The server is incredibly rude and chooses to favour only those who are doing catering, also charges for take out containers. Food is decent but will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Wanted some samosas for the guests who were arriving, so landed at Oh! Bombay to give it a try.   Ordered 24 samosas (0.55 cents each) and a paneer tikka wrap ($7). As the order took a few minutes as the samosas needed to be fried, we sat down. There is a buffet that is being offered for $13, but the food is enclosed so I believe one has to ask the owner to fill up your plate - a bit odd, but I guess minimizes wastage. Even though it was a weekend lunch time, there no takers for buffet, but a few takeouts were seen.   When reached home found the samosas to be a bit more fried, they were dark and not golden brown. The  filling was perfect and better than any of the cheap samosas you get in Indian grocers. The shape seemed as if they were factory made (yes, there is a samosa factory in GTA). The over fried samosas were noted by all guests as well.   The wrap was a shared lunch and was bit disappointing. The size was small for $7- just enough for a kid. The filling OK and too many big pieces of green peppers."}
{"text":"Very slow services. Samosas @50 C each isn't worth trying. Other foods looks and taste bad. I wonder who is eating in such place. Why to waste money and time here if you can get the better food somewhere else in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Not bad Indian food. For those people who don't know the different types of Indian food, this is a great option for take home dishes. The food is reasonably priced and portioned decently. I found the food oily (but this can be typical for Indian take out). I don't recommend calling in an order based on the online menu. This location doesn't make everything the online menu offers. We ordered the food based on the online menu and we were sent to another location (waste of my gas and time). We found that weekends are staffed by people who are not properly trained on how to cook. So go during a week night."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for fast food . I've never been disappointed . The lady that works the front i assume  Is the owner is really sweet .always kind and gives me tips on what to try . That's always a pleasant thing . If you've never had Indian food this is probably one of the better places to try it as you can see all the food being the buffet Window and they can give you advise on what to try . Oh and they now have a few Hakka dishes !"}
{"text":"Oh Bombay is a little restaurant located on Winston Churchill and Laird in Mississauga. I went and had the Buffet . Overall I was not happy with the service for several reasons.  For starters it is Not an Open Buffet! Every time you finish your plate you have to get in line  again and wait about 5 to 10 minutes for the other people to get served for take out and then w they will serve you. My suggestion is fill up two plates before you sit down. The other problem was the food was  not fresh.  \"it tasted like it had sat there for the  whole day\" or it might be leftovers. I found if you go at 11:45 in the morning you will get to the food fresh. The \"butter chicken\" chicken was dry and butter sauce needs more FLAVOR. The onion naan  was really good but \"you must ask them not to burn it for you\" or they will send it out burn. The vegetarian dishes very good  but in all the meat dishes  the meat was dry. The fish was good in some dishes but mushy in others. If you want to order rice order the white rice because it's cooked fresh as needed but the biryani it's not fresh in my opinion. The Samosas are good but not the best. The Sweet's are not made in house,   they are not the best I've tasted."}
{"text":"Came here after work. It is a small establishment. Seats sixteen. They have a variety of food on display. Wanted to try them all so decided to go for the buffet. Buffet price $12.99. The buffet here however is not self serve. I asked the owner why - the city did not give the permit. Besides the foods on display, the buffet included naan and tandoori chicken from kitchen and also sweets and unlimited canned pops.  The food was decent but like other Indian buffet restaurants very rich and oily. Also tandoori chicken doesn't look like it was cooked in tandoori oven which imparts a typical flavor.  The restaurant seems to be operated by husband and wife. Both were friendly."}
{"text":"Small place with great flavors. Food is simply superb. And the prices are so low - paid less than 6 bux for rice and chicken dish, excellent texture and flavor. The owner should start thinking about larger venue, it sure deserves it. Clean and neat place, the owner is in great spirits and serving attitude, genuine and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious battered spicy fish! with heavenly side sauce.  Desperately seeking food on a cold night with torrential rains, the bright storefront lights of Oh! Bombay called to us from the slippery Winston Churchill Blvd traffic. To our utter dismay, we'd stepped in just 4 minutes before closing time, but the owner, seeking to impress (which he did), insisted we wait just 3 minutes for him to fry up some lightly battered spicy fish to-go. He said we could taste it before purchasing it. Deal!  The fish took 4 minutes, came out overflowing in a large to-go container, golden in color and wafting fierce aromatic spice. The owner speared a small piece with a toothpick and let us try. It was amazing. Soft, fresh white fish in a spicy batter coating. He tossed in a white cream sauce with its own adventurous melange of flavors, and the pairing was divine. All for under $5. I hope there's an occasion for me to travel back that way again to see what else is on the menu.  Good food for a fair price."}
{"text":"Love it! Got delivery from this place and it has since become my favorite indian takeout in mississauga.  We got chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo, a potatos/peas dish (forgot the name). The tikka masala was okay, it wasnt as flavorful as i am used to put the portion was huge. The chicken vindaloo was incresible, it had a real kick to it and was extremely tasty, and again the portion is so big it was overflowing the container. The potato dish was also a real treat, the potatos were stewed vert soft and the sauce is savory and a bit sweet. We also got garlic naan on the side but they did lack the garlicy taste so thats a pass for me, meh.   Overall the food was very very delicous, the price is reasonable, ans the portions are just ridiculously large compared to pretty much any indian resturant. If you order a meal here you are guaranteed leftovers. 100% would come again!"}
{"text":"Quite good depending on what you order. We usually  get the Thali combo -- you get a lot of food for your money here. We also enjoy their pakoras and samosas. They now offer more vegan items due to demand -- there's a coconut cabbage dish they have sometimes which is delicious. The potato dish and lentil dish are good too. I will say though that I think the food here is a bit too oily.   One more thing... They have nice samosas."}
{"text":"This place was... okay! I think there might be a dearth of decent, cheap Indian around here. I, like most reviewers, chose thali options from the options visible behind glass. They were fine. The fish curry was mushy, because apparently it was fried and then put in curry. Don't know why anyone would do that. I do wonder if the separate street-food menu would yield better results.  Service was pretty poor. The woman working front-of-house is extremely slow and not very nice. I was in line for a good 15 minutes, with only one party ordering in front of me, so I had time to watch. When someone orders a thali, she walks away, sticks her head in the kitchen, and demands a fresh naan. Then she comes back, the person orders another thali, and the whole thing repeats itself. A better system would be to take THE ENTIRE ORDER and then request the appropriate number of naan. I was starving and at my wit's end by the time i actually got to place my order."}
{"text":"Was looking for somethjng quick before work. I was recommend getting the first combo. I agreed and chose the chicken tika which was fantastic.  Only issue I had one as she never gave me a choice on weather I wanted naan or rice.  I asked her and then gave me option.    What makes it worse the rice was watery.   Disappointing dinner and experience.   Found it very cold inside as well."}
{"text":"One of my friends raved about how good the food was at Oh! Bombay so that's where we ended up for lunch this weekend.  It's a small little Indian fast-food restaurant where you can either get take-out or eat there. We had they're ayce lunch which was well worth the money. For only $12 (and some change) you can stuff yourself silly with yummy Indian food. There's about 10 choices you can choose from so it's not a whole lot. Everything was tasty! The owners were very friendly and kept us well-fed during our stay.  I definitely would recommend Oh! Bombay to others who are in the area and are looking for cheap but yummy Indian food.  PS: AYCE is only available on weekends."}
{"text":"I love Oh Bombay! I'm a bit sad their Oakville location has closed, as it was closer to us, but it's worth it to make a bit more of a trip to get their butter chicken.   Oh Bombay was my first experience with Indian, and it's a good idea to start here if you've never had it before, or have trouble with spice. They are a buffet, so you can try many things without the commitment. I highly recommend the butter chicken and the tikka masala - they are so delicious and not that spicy, so perfect for me. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
