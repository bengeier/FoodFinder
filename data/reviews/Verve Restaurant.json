{"text":"This restaurant replaced The Juniper Grille.  It's only open for lunch and dinner. Recently I had dinner there with a small group. The food was good - particularly the scallops and the fish and chips.  Its kind of a slow spot at dinner, but it assume it will pick up as more people learn about it. It has free parking, so its a good spot before an event in Playhouse Square."}
{"text":"Great Service was attentive but not overbearing.  Interesting menu that even had city chicken on it, not many places do, which is a favorite of mine.  Ordered that as my entree; its was wonderful, not dry and served with an interesting apple puree.  Great beer list and wine list although no mixed drinks available; not a problem for me.  Was not crowded for a Friday evening which is a shame.  They served complimentary bread with a choice of an olive spread and some sort of carmelized onion spread both were awesome!  Wouldn't definately go here again"}
{"text":"*impeccable* service. scallops were delicious. nice beer list!"}
{"text":"I was in town to see a Cleveland Indians game and stayed at the Hilton up the street.  After we arrived, the hotel desk clerk recommended it for lunch.  Nice clean place with good service.  I had a nice gazpacho soup with dill and cucumber.  The fried fish sandwich looked good, but tasted quite bland and the greens were a bit wilted.  I'd go again for lunch if I were in same area."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, service was excellent.  Unfortunately for me, I didn't find much on the menu appealing.  I had the fish sandwich.  Presentation was excellent.  Taste was lacking.  

Rest of the people I went with enjoyed their meals, I just didn't find anything special about it.  Perhaps the dinner menu is better."}
