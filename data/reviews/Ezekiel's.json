{"text":"Diamond in the (retail strip center) rough. We tried four different meals and was shocked at how incredible the food tasted. Tilapia fillet was seasoned perfectly and was huge, fried chicken lived up to it's award winning billing, ribs were great. Sides: sweet potatoes were a little too sweet for me, but baked beans were amazing, good tasting mashed potatoes and gravy, and good mac and cheese. 

Feels like the Owners desire to know each customer. 

It takes quite awhile to get the food, but that's because they make it after ordering - and it comes out HOT!

We have already come back a second time and plan on making it a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Fried Chicken, Rack of Ribs, Collard Greens, Corn Bread , Sweet Potatoes, Macaroni and Potato Salad and Fried Cabbage...Got your attention?! Or did I have you at Fried Chicken? :)

And it's all sooo delicious!  The fried chicken is out of this world. Take a bite. Crispy on the outside, then savory, juicy and steamy right out of the fryer. Luscious!

Fried Cabbage just melts in your mouth. Everything is top notch. Love the Baked Macaroni, too.

The owners are super nice! It's wonderful to have such fantastic food in Ahwatukee.

Can't wait to try their homeade pies."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's about the food.  Sometimes it's about the people and the food.  Brad and Laurita not only make amazing food, they're beautiful people who are passionate about people and food.  Fried chicken delicious.  Collard greens just the right amount of peppery kick.  Mac and cheese.  Best ever!  They treated us to a piece of black velvet cake for my Birthday.  Craving good home cooking and comfort food for your soul.  Go. You will not be disappointed.  My one small wish - and it does not take away from my 5 star rating is that they would serve food on actual plates instead of take out boxes for folks that dine in."}
{"text":"The staff and cooks are absolutely amazing. My wife got the cat fish and baked Mack and cheese which was delicious. I got the fried chicken, baked mac & cheese, and collard greens all of which were excellent the end the inside of the chicken and the catfish were extremely succulent and made fresh. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been in twice now. The owner is super nice. 

Unbelievably wonderful fried chicken. The best I have found in the area. Made to order so it does take some time, but this chicken is worth the wait. 

Each super hot and fresh from the fryer bite made me smile. The crunchy delicious skin and the juicy chicken are the best I have had, other than Moms home cooking. 

My favorite sides so far are the cornbread and the sweet potatoes. Both were sweet and delicious. 

Saw a couple of the AZ Cardinal players in there enjoying a meal the last time I stopped by. Go Cards!!

Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was awesome! I got the catfish, greens and potato salad; hubby got the two piece chicken, mac n cheese, and greens - it was all wonderful. The catfish was honestly some of the best we have ever tasted, no joke. 

The owner is SO incredibly nice and welcoming, and talented in the kitchen. However, his daughter is a different story. I feel bad because her attitude is surely negatively affecting business - there were only a handful of people in there at lunch time.

I hope they stay open because this is a one of a kind place with nothing like anywhere near Tukee!"}
{"text":"The best ribs I've had in a long time and the cornbread was awesome!  I plan to return this weekend to try the fried chicken.  The owners seem like really nice people.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have never had such awful food... The catfish and chicken were old and overcooked same with the  green beans and the LITTLE sweet potato pie my dog would not eat. The website made me give it 1 star or it would be none. RUN AWAY"}
{"text":"The place is comfy and cozy. The food is really good! The Peanut Butter cake is amazing and the Red Velvet is a winner! If you are a Soul Food Lover you have got to try this place they are indeed the best in Arizona. I wanted to try everything on the menu but when I go back I will!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in the young lady did not seem very happy very dry ,i told her this was my first time not that it mattered she still didn't show any expression. I ordered the catfish but it did not taste like catfish,not only that it was fried hard almost over cooked I'm glad I was close by because if I had came from my place of residence for this I would not be very happy ."}
{"text":"One of the best fried catfish I've ever had. 

The cornmeal breading on the big hunk of fish is crispy, not greasy, about light to medium in thickness, well seasoned with salt, and the fish was very moist but still nice and flaky. Just...woah.

The above average sized fried chicken breast had a regular crunchy flour batter with a decent amount of seasoning. Parts were a little dry and it just became disappointing with the amazing catfish. I'll definitely go with dark neat next time. 

The collard greens seemed to be steamed/boiled with carrots or it had some sugar added to it. A little too sweet for veggies for me. The mac n cheese had a pre crust crumbled on top but it was all a little more mushy and wet than I would like. The little piece of cornbread is sweet and really moist. More like a cake.

It's a little place in a strip mall with a few decorations of athlete paintings and pictures (Suns and Cardinals). The service is straight forward counter-order."}
{"text":"Was looking for good fried chicken (not KFC or Churchs) without having to drive all the way to Lo Lo's. Found this place. Have been here several times.  Food is delicious every time and my kids love it too."}
{"text":"Not only was the chicken the best I've had in Phoenix, the sides were all great too. The staff was very friendly and helpful as it was our first time in. Yelp says they closed at 9 but their door said 8. The (I'm assuming) owner assured us they would cook as long as people were coming in for food. So if you're craving really juicy well seasoned fried chicken, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Great spot! It's more like takeout style. So, if you're looking for a sit down restaurant, this isn't it. But, the food is amazing and the owner is so hospitable and has some great stories about his journey! Best fried chicken for miles!"}
{"text":"Great food and really friendly family that owns the place. I love the Mac n cheese and fried chicken here. Be prepared to wait for your food if it's busy but keep in mind that it's all made fresh so it's worth the wait. The one complaint I have is that the dessert section on the menu is pretty small, wish they did hot desserts like a fruit cobbler or something along those lines."}
{"text":"I come here at least 1x a week the food is GREAT and so is the service!! Owners are great people always a pleasure to go in there!!"}
{"text":"Just had Ezekial's fried chicken and several side dishes by take-out last night. It was very good!  We really liked the chicken, green beans and the coleslaw, which was dressed with a mayo base but lightly--just right and perfect complement to the chicken. Can't wait to try their ribs on my next order. I have high expectations."}
{"text":"Great soul food family business. The wait is a bit long but worth it because they care about the food! LOVE their greens!"}
{"text":"If your not from Arizona and looking for some good soul food.....Ezekiel's is not the place to go. I ate here for the first time today and I had chicken, catfish macaroni and sweet potatoes. The catfish taste like pre-breaded tilapia, it was total garbage. The chicken was ok but I cook better chicken. The mac-n-cheese was a mushy-gushy lump of grease with no flavor. However the sweet potatoes were good but they were cold. Overall big disappointment and I will never go back. Empty calories and waste of time"}
{"text":"FRIED CHICKEN, FRIED CHICKEN & MORE FRIED CHICKEN! By far the best fried chicken I have had and I don't have to drive all the way to Phoenix. Heard about this place through my boyfriend's mom who got their coupons in the mail. It's a bit hard to find but look for the circular yellow sign, that's Ezekiel's. It's a small place but the owners are extremely nice. Walked in and I think it was the owner's daughter and son sitting in the table closest to the counter (didn't really enjoy having them sit there the whole time on their computer, kind of made us uncomfortable when we were eating our meal). The daughter took our order which was the 2 piece meal but she didn't let us know that you had a choice to pick your pieces. We had to find out when the owner was taking an order and offered it to his customer.... oh well. Our food came out and it was delicious! I had collard greens and everyone said mac n cheese was a must-have. So collard greens were AWESOME! I had to add a little more apple cider vinegar and hot sauce cuz I like my greens with a tang. Mac n cheese... ehhhhhhhhhh. When you say baked, I assume it's going to have a crispy crumb topping. It was just crusty cheese on cheese. It wasn't as creamy either, a bit oily and I couldn't finish it. It was good overall but just not what I expected. The cornbread is sweet and crumbly and the fried chicken is to die for! Crispy, hot from the fryer, full of flavor and JUICY! THIS is mouthwatering, finger licking good, pick up the crispy pieces from your plate GOOOOOD! We had a coupon for a free dessert and I chose the chocolate cake. A little dry cuz it was late at night but it was DIVINE. So sweet and the frosting is really good. Definitely wanting to go back for more fried chicken!"}
{"text":"My husband and I bought our dinner here tonight and here is what we thought.

The restaurant service seemed in disarray, the staff were perhaps too relaxed and hanging about being loud and were not wearing hairnets or hats. Nor were the kitchen staff inside.When we got around to eating the portion sizes were good. I had the fried chicken dinner. Within moments of cutting in I found a hair. it was really gross and off putting. My husband also ordered the chicken and in all fairness it tasted good. The sides on the other hand needs improvement. We also ordered the fried catfish sandwich, which was good although you had to apply your own condiments and did not include any \"sauce\". The cornbread was also good

So in a nutshell if you enjoy catfish sandwiches, fried chicken and cornbread this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Family owned, owners are super nice. It's been a while since I've been here. However, don't think I've ever been disappointed (catfish, YUM) Not a huge dessert fan but I hear the peach cobbler is awesome too...may be time to make my way back over there."}
{"text":"No better fried chicken in AZ!! Way better than Lolos and the staff is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Hello my fellow yelpers!! I write this review we'll I'm grubbing on my yummy leftovers!!!  The only upside for not working for yelp no more is the  reviews!!! This is my first review since I left. Any who let's talk food and service!! I went into this place tonight with my family and the owners where so personal and nice from the moment we enter to the moment we left!! The food was so good, this coming from a picky guy and even picker kids!!! For my oldest son who rarely eat meat, to eat all of his chicken sand which and to talk about how good it was after that speaks volume in my eyes!!! We will be becoming regulars to say the least! To the owners and staff thank you very much if your reading this from the Jefferson family.. To everyone else what you waiting on go check this place out"}
{"text":"Got to go food here after a meeting in Phoenix. Amazing food, made to order. Friendly place  and good people. The chicken is awesome."}
{"text":"I was really interested in this place that opened up across the street, I got ribs to die for,  collard greens to die for, and I learned the mom makes all the desserts in the morning. I got red velvet cake. It was all great, but cost me $18 for dinner"}
{"text":"Best local soul food around.  Made fresh and served with pride.   Fried chicken and Mac and cheese awesome."}
{"text":"Oh my. The food is delicious. Reminds me of going to the south, good home style cooking. I get the chicken cabbage and Mac and cheese. My lady gets catfish, greens, and Mac and cheese. I have tried other soul food restaurants, and they don't come close to comparing."}
{"text":"Small, but delicious food.  The vibe inside reminds me of Amy Ruth's in Harlem, NY with all of the great art and photos.  Also, great customer service. Recommend for sure."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!  I haven't had sweet potatoes like these EVER.  Best meal I've had in a long time.  Greens, chicken, cornbread, were so good but the sweet potatoes took the cake!  Phenomenal!  IF you enjoy soul food and you have yet to eat at Ezekiel's aka Zeke's then you need to go tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I have been craving some GOOD soulfood since moving here from California in July and after several weeks of google and yelp, Ezekiel's was high on the list of places to try out. So this past Saturday, I was finally able to go there and I ordered the Fried Chicken Lunch meal with 3 sides (mac & cheese, greens and sweet potatoes) and needless to say, I was beyond dissapointed. The greens taste like sugar, the mac & cheese was just the mac (not cheesy at all) and the sweet potatoes were a mush of burnt sweet potatoes with a pound of nutmeg on top. The fried chicken was ok but definitely not what I am used too. I would prefer Albertson's chicken over Ezekiel's anyday. The best part of the meal was the sprite that helped wash down the dissapointment. I should of read between the lines when I walked in and the place was empty.  It's back to the drawing board for me. I think it is safe to say that AZ is definitely slacking in the food department."}
{"text":"Honestly it was the best crab cakes ive ever had in my life!! No exaggeration. ..the sides were hot and tasted like it jus got finished. Great food great food! Im going tere today again!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from LA was in the mood from some real comfort food and I found it hear !! I got the 2 meat combo catfish  a fat juicy chicken breast mac cheese and some greens.pleasant customer service makes u feel at home!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! People are awesome and the chicken hit the spot!!!! Love this place!!! I would post pictures, but I couldn't wait to eat it!! :)"}
{"text":"This places food and friendly service is awsome. I love it!! It's food for the soul thats seasoned and flavored just right. 
And you get plenty to eat at a fair price. :)"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing. The chicken falls off the bone. The collard greens are the best."}
{"text":"(If I could give this place zero stars, I would!) The owners claim their food is better than their competitors and even go as far as talking badly about the other soul food places in the valley. They say their prices are cheap compared to other soul food places but honestly, I wouldn't mind paying a little extra for quality food. I had the catfish dinner. Catfish was so bland (least they could have done was simply add some salt to it!). Sides were also not up to par. I had the potato salad and mac & cheese and both were way too sweet! If I wanted something sweet, I would have ordered dessert. I would not recommend this place nor would I ever go back to this place. They might want to consider serving some humble pie because they talk so highly of their food but it's nothing they should be proud of. If you want real soul food, pay a little extra and go to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles! Your stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to work in the area, but I live way in Mesa. Now that I work in Mesa I don't get over as often, but I do love their chicken, cabbage, greens, mac-n-cheese, and cornbread.I love love love this place...They are really sweet people and I love their chicken."}
{"text":"I love this family owned Soul Food Restaurant in Ahwatukee. Not only are the husband and wife owners first rate with customer service, the food is so good. If you grew up eating soul food as I did, it is not easy to impress. My Mom was an awesome cook and I took her recipes and learned how to cook well also, However, finding a restaurant that cooks the Macaroni and Cheese with just the right amount of cheesiness, is not easy. Most of the time the mac and cheese will be more emphasis on the macaroni than the cheese. 

So I always approach soul food restaurants with a moderate dose of skepticism combined with a healthy dose of hopefulness and anticipation. Ezekiel's does not disappoint. Not only was my Mac and Cheese just right, so were the Collard Greens, Fried Catfish, and Yams (AKA Sweet Potatoes). One downside is there is a wait, because they prepare everything fresh, but the upside is, it is worth the wait. Topping it off with the sweet potato pie, was the icing on the cake. That type of pie is often over done, but again, this restaurant did not disappoint. Excellent SOUL FOOD, and great service with a smile. Although I cannot go too often, since I am trying to lose weight, I have been several times, and plan to go back. Also will recommend to others who enjoy this type of cuisine. EZEKIELS=Great Soul Food!"}
{"text":"Oh gracious, what can I say!  Was in the mood for fried chicken and theirs is out of this world.  My husband who normally eats one breast and picks at the wings, ate 2 breasts, a leg, a thigh and a wing. It was chicken with breading, not breading with a little chicken like you get most places. I know someone said they were pricey but I don't think so for the \"quality\" you get.  The chicken was succulent and the breading was seasoned perfectly. My husband has been to Mrs. White's and says this chicken beats there hands down. Also, tried the slaw which had just enough sweetness and was not vinegary which meets my personal taste. I get my hair cut right next door to the place but this is the first time I tried it and I did it based on Yelp reviews.  Now I know what I will be bringing home every 6 weeks for dinner.

If I have any criticism, it would be their $5 delivery charge.  Between that and the tip, I paid an extra $9 over what it would have cost had I picked it up myself.  However, suck it up, last night it was worth it between the heat and how tired I was from work. We are only 2 1/2 miles away so from now on if I want it on a non-haircut night, I will go right from work before my body has a chance to say \"hallelujah, cool in here so relax - don't go out again.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and great people. Food is always piping hot and fresh. They get all their food fresh and cook your order when you order it nothing is per made. I'm not in town much but this my go to place when I'm home."}
{"text":"I need to go back and try everything. My first time in and heartily greeted. I ended up choosing crab cakes with collards and sweet potatoes. It was delicious, the sweet potatoes were like candy - you'd want some at Thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"Had seen this place on Check Please so decided to try it on my birthday. I'm glad my boyfriend and I did. The customer service was good and the food was even more amazing. I was a little iffy about trying soul food  because it is hard to fine when you're not in the south but this place sure proved me wrong. The wait was a little long but it was worth it and don't let the decor fool you. I got the two piece chicken,collard greens, and sweet potatoes. The chicken was juicy and the skin was crispy which I was surprised because it's hard to find when it comes to white meat. The collard greens were seasoned just right and the sweet potatoes... can you get me a big bucket of it please. My boyfriend had the green beans on the side and those were amazing as well. We tasted a little hint of sweetness and vinaigrette of some sort, it was different but in a good way. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good soul food."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in Phoenix, hands down. The owners (Laurita & Brad) are genuinely friendly. Good to know that there are still people who care about their craft and their customers. I will be working my way through the menu from top to bottom.

Today's selection was from the dinner menu; Fried Chicken (breast & wing), sweet potatos and collard greens. 

Be prepared to visit with your companions for a while as you wait for your food as everything is prepared after you order...can't rush these simple pleasures."}
{"text":"I was out in the Ahwatukee area and looking for some Soul food, so I stopped in at Ezekiel's. I was greeted quickly and decided on having the catfish dinner.  While not the best Catfish I ever had, it was satisfying and hot.  I guess I was expecting a soul food meal similar to LoLo's or Mrs. Whites.  So my 3 stars is basically in comparison to those excellent soul food establishments."}
{"text":"It's really nice to have your favor restaurant at a major airport. The soul food here is probably the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome fish and chicken; incredibly friendly operators. Top off your meal with sweet potato pie and you'll be set.  A great soul food fix in the desert."}
{"text":"The fish and chicken were excellent!!. Mac n cheese ok. Needs more seasoning and cheese for me and came out room temp. Please use more cheese and warm up! We will definitely going back but I won't order that side. Other than that I would say it's a good find for AZ."}
{"text":"Thank you Check Please, Arizona!  We'd never have found Ezekiel's without you.

Super nice people, super good food...what more could you ask?  The fried chicken is the best we've had anywhere and the corn bread was like a dessert.  The baked mac n cheese was fantastic.  

Not a fancy place but inviting enough and true to it's comfort food roots.  A great find all around!"}
{"text":"Locally owned and bring great tastes to Phoenix and Awatukee.  Family run with simple and great dishes.  Fried Chicken to perfection, Rib's are fall off the bone tender and tasty, Cornbread is great.  Don't miss the sides:  Sweet Potato, Baked Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans.  Seems that most with the exception to the Ribs, that are slow cooked, is cooked to order and fresh.

Owners are cordial and friendly.  Still getting their signage so it is a touch hard to see.

Good portions, going to take a bit to crawl through all the offerings especially the Sides and Desserts.

In the Basha's Center at 48th and Warner on the South side."}
{"text":"Wow! I just had the fried chicken! It was perfectly cooked perfectly breaded and the breast and wing pieces were very large. I love the cooked cabbage and pick it as a side every time. The banana walnut cake is a giant slab of yumminess!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!  Finally, a place that serves fried chicken.  And not just any fried chicken; the BEST fried chicken I've had in Phoenix!  The catfish was also delicious.  We tried the macaroni, green beans, cole slaw, and fries (for the toddler).  The sides alone could be a meal.  We didn't have anything to take home, so we ordered ribs to go.  The owners are friendly and greet you as you walk in and then they come around to check on you and chat for a few minutes.  We will be back, to try the rest of the menu.  Keep in mind this is not fast food.  It will take 20 minutes or so to prepare your meal for you.  Good food is always worth the wait, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I just devoured the fried chicken....delicious. The green beans were mildly sweet and had a little kick, different but very tasty. I also had the mac & cheese, it too was yummy. The gentleman that waited on me was extremely kind and the little restaurant had a nice homey feel. I really enjoyed my first experience and will definitely be back. Thanks for the great fried chicken...loved it."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was amazing. I ordered delivery through Uber eats. The chicken was still crispy when it arrived and had the perfect amount of batter and crispness. The cornbread is the best I have tasted in a really long time. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Good southern food for cheap! Kind of a long wait for the food, but it is made fresh to order so it's understandable."}
{"text":"Very yummy, fresh made food. The Fried Chicken and Catfish are cooked to order. The sides are ample and flavorful.
Service is casual, so sit back and relax. Enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Myself and a co-worker literally order from this place EVERY WEEK at-least once but if we're lucky more. The service is down right amazing and the food is diabolically good! I grew up on soul food and this is reminds me of my grand mommas cooking. 

I just love coming in here and enjoying a meal. 

Tip: call in about 15 mins before to place your order. This is because everything is started fresh so there is a wait if You don't order ahead."}
{"text":"I am a true southern girl born and raised. I was excited to try this southern soul food place near the house. What a disappointment. The greens were way overly seasoned and not even cooked enough. The chicken was bland behind words"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I went to lunch here.  This is the best soul food I've had in Phoenix.  We both got fried chicken dinners, and they were fantastic.  The breading was crispy and well seasoned and the chicken was delicious and juicy.  The sides and cornbread are top notch as well. 

All the meats are cooked to order so there is about a 10-15 minute wait.  You can call ahead your order though so it'll be ready when you arrive."}
{"text":"I loved it! I haven't had Red Kool-aid since I was a kid in the 70's-80's..... the chicken and catfish was fried well....my husband said the Catfish was on point...we finally found a place that reminds us of home OAKLAND, CA...."}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken and cornbread, spicy collards and yams to live for. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food. I read a review where someone thought that their food was better than lolo's..it is!! Mac n' cheese was great, potato salad, sweet potatoes, greens, and catfish very tasty. Oh, yes cornbread too"}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 2 only because the sides were delicious but the entree was horrible. I ordered a catfish plate that comes with 2 pcs of fish & 2 sides also a 2 pc chicken on the side. The chicken was seasoned ok but the chicken tasted like it was fried in old oil. If you haven't eaten fried chicken in old oil, it's like eating burnt  popcorn. The catfish looked good but diving into it was unpleasant, it was rubbery & slimy indications of old fish. The seasoning on the fish was bland but the breading held well. I ordered sweet potatoes & mac n cheese as the sides, both were great. The mac n cheese was creamy & cheesy with the potatoes being tender and sweet. It also came with cornbread which was moist & flaky. Although the sides were scrumptious I do not plan to go again."}
{"text":"My family visited Ezekiel's for lunch last week.  I'm from Atlanta and my wife is from Texas so we both grew up eating the sort of food that is served here.  

We had a variety of items -  fried chicken, crab cake, sweet potatoes, collard greens, macaroni & cheese, and corn bread.  All were excellent.  Stand outs were:  fried chicken that was served up so hot that we had a wait a bit before we could take a bite; Sweet potatoes that had an awesome flavor; Collard greens that were just right - tender, but not mushy and not too salty or sweet like some places.

We were extremely pleased that authentic southern comfort food is now available in Ahwatukee and will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my 2 very different experiences having Ezekiel's.  My first experience was carry out.  My boyfriend dined in and brought dinner home for me.  For us to share he ordered a Catfish dinner with sweet potatoes and mac and cheese, an extra side of greens, potato salad and mac & cheese (to go).  We realized they forgot the side of mac & cheese and included an extra side of potato salad instead.  No worries!

During the first visit the catfish was only so-so.  I didn't care for the breading, it wasn't very flavorful.  It was dry actually. Maybe because I didn't eat it fresh out of the grease.  I'm not sure but it was pretty dry.  The sweet potatoes were really good but sweet - borderline too sweet and had a texture of sweet potato pie filling. They didn't taste homemade either.  The mac & cheese wasn't even mentionable - too dry, not enough cheese and no flavor. The collard greens were seasoned with turkey necks (my favorite) but also taste sweet, as if they added sugar.  No worries - Where I'm from some people like their green sweet, some like them savory.  I'm a savory girl!  The potato salad saved the day.  It was mustard based with mayo - nice and Southern just how I like it.  Just like I make my own potato salad.  I rated my first taste of Ezekiel's with a 3 out of 5.

My second time trying Ezekiel's we dined in, on a Saturday afternoon.  This time I ordered the catfish dinner again with collard greens and sweet potatoes.  This time I LOVED the catfish.  It was served pippin' hot, fresh out of the grease.  When I ordered my food I asked for vinegar because I remembered the greens were sweet last time.  Vinegar gives sweet greens a nice balance.  I didn't need vinegar this time because the greens weren't sweet, they also didn't have any meat at all in them. No big deal!  The sweet potatoes this time were way too sweet and I realized for sure that they come out of the can.  No little strings in the sweet potatoes.  Those that bake homemade sweet potatoes would understand what I mean.  Still good, just not homemade. My boyfriend ordered the crab cake dinner with cabbage and mac and cheese.  Again, skip the mac & cheese, the cabbage is scrumptious!  The crab cakes fell all the way short.  They're definitely not made from lump crab meat, taste more like a mixture of back fin and claw meat. We also couldn't tell if they were broiled or fried. They didn't taste old per se, more like they were cooked earlier that day when they opened and dropped in the grease when we ordered.  Also you'll notice I said nothing about the cornbread ... because well ... I thought there was nothing to be said about that either.  Too crumbly and dry I think. My boyfriend thought otherwise, he liked it a lot!

After 2 visits I'd give them a solid 4.  I know exactly what not to get and still have things I'd like to try like the fried chicken and ribs."}
{"text":"Yum! Best friend chicken I've had in a long time. So sad it took me so long to try this place. Had it yesterday and may go back today!"}
{"text":"Soo good!  Friendly owners and delicious food.  A great place to feed your soul.  And the cornbread is amazing."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness my southern boy heart has finally found southern style baked Mac and cheese that is almost as good as my mommas! I called and ordered pick up for my way home from work, really just hoping this place was good, and let me just tell you...Ezekiel's did not disappoint! My wife ordered the fried chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese, and I ordered the fried catfish with fries.
The chicken was tender, well seasoned, crispy and so juicy on the inside. Definitely one of the best chicken sandwiches she's ever had. 
My catfish were cooked very well and the cornmeal breading was just to die for. One bite took me back home to the Deep South where I grew up, I was in heaven. 
As an added bonus they had strawberry cake which is one of my favorites, it was also just delicious!"}
{"text":"A co worker of mine and I had been trying to get here for a while, and were finally able to shake loose from work to get over here for lunch. There was an AWESOME Yelp deal $10 for $20 worth of food! We each went with the 2 piece chicken meal that came with a side. We both selected the macaroni and cheese, along with the purple kool aid to go along with it. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and perfectly fried, albeit the pieces were kind of small. The macaroni and cheese was disappointing, it was very oily and didn't have any cream or sauce to pull it together. All in all, it was a good meal but not sure I'd go out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Expect to spend about 10-15 dollars for a platter, not including a beverage. Being that I lived down south for 7 years this is the most comparable \"soul food\" restaurant I've found in AZ. 
Their hours are 11am-8pm. 

Pros:
Hearty portions, ribs are fall off the bone tender, delectable cornbread, friendly staff, good location

Cons:
The interior leaves much to be desired. It could use a good bit of TLC on the floors and walls, but I've come to expect that from mom and pop places. 

Overall I liked the place. I'd even recommend it to others. I'll be going back to try some of their other menu options in the near future!"}
{"text":"It's a very southern style restaurant and the employees seem to all be family. The vibe is very chill and the food is AMAZBALLS!!!"}
{"text":"I love trying out local eateries!  Found Ezekiel's soul food on yelp and fried chicken and catfish sounded good. There was a sign outside that said \"best fried chicken...\".   Ordered up 2 pieces of chicken and fried catfish. Got the baked man and cheese and green beans as the sides.  

The mac and cheese was only so so for me, the green beans were awesome!  

The fried catfish was really good, the cornbread crust was light and crispy. Fish was cooked perfectly. Seasoning was excellent!

The fried chicken was awesome as well. I'm not sure it was the best I've had ever but it definitely ranks in my top 5. The seasoning and coating was awesome. Chicken was fried perfectly.  Juicy and tasty!  

Both the chicken and fish were so good I totally forgot about adding the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food & friendly service! Love the Mac&cheese and the chicken. The cornbread is good too - not dry like other places."}
{"text":"In a word:  Yum!

Ordered two \"dinners\" midday Thursday:  20 minute lead time phone in order for pick up:

-  2 pc. all white fried chicken, mashed, green beans.

-  St. Louis ribs, baked beans, F.F.

The cornbread is to die for...perfect sweetness and no embedded chunks of foreign veggies!

Everything was deliciously hot still when I opened them at home and I was very impressed as I suspected I might be after seeing them profiled on a local restaurant review TV show a few months back. In fact the chicken, in my opinion, should cool to almost room temp. before enjoying- batter coating delicious and not disguised with pepper.

French fries, boxed separately, were still crispy/moist and not oversalted.

I'll leave you with this:  The green beans are the best!  Sweet, salty, cooked to hell and flavorful!

I'm going back soon for another helping and some dessert too."}
{"text":"My mom gets this chicken whenever we have family gatherings and oh my gosh it is SO good. Probably some of the best fried chicken I've had. I definitely will not be getting fried chicken anywhere else if I have a craving for it. Definitely five stars worthy"}
{"text":"Ezekiel's has the BEST fried chicken in Arizona period! It is juicy and delicious and their Mac and Cheese put a smile on this east coast born and raised girls face! Their food is the first that I've taste that's comparable to home since my family moved here in 2013 and I'm so glad that their here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite treat.  It takes a bit of time to cook fresh but it is well worth the wait.  You can even call your order in and it will be ready when you get there.

The sweet potato pie is to die for.  I can never wait till after my meal to eat it.  I end up eatting the whole thing while waiting for my meal to be cooked.

I have had a variety of the sides.  Top of the line flavors and I love that they offer kool-aid, too.  Definately will be your go-to place for the best fried chicken in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This might be the only place in Ahwatukee that cooks your food to order. Call ahead or use Grubhub! Even if you wait for it, it's so worth it, as the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Yes, believe it or not there is really good Soul Food in Ahwatukee.  Love the breaded catfish, the fried chicken, and especially the greens.  Lots of flavor to them, and they're not drenched in butter.  The mac and cheese is good.  The cornbread is a bit of a disappointment, as is the sauteed cabbage, but by and large the food is very good, and the owners really friendly and proud of what they're doing."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING 10/5 stars i came from Maryland looking for some really good soul food and this is THE place for it and the owner is very nice very good customer service! I would encourage any and everyone to come a get some great food!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesomely fresh made fried chicken. A real mom and pops shop. Very friendly owners! I'd much rather support this type of establishment than a KFC."}
{"text":"The food here was great. Best fried chicken I've had in Arizona and the sides & cornbread were good as well. The staff was friendly and the food was hot & fresh. We'll definitely go back. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN I HAVE EVER HAD! BTW I am from the south and the flavor of the fried chicken is to DIE FOR! JUICY AND TASTY!  I special order and get 3 thighs especially when I am in the mood for Fried Chicken and he literally has the BEST FRIED CHICKEN in the world especially Phoenix!!!.  I come here ALL the time and they know me by name.  Mr. Ezekiel reminds me of how my grandmother cooked for me in Mississippi.  I always order the Fried Chicken with Macaroni & Cheese (LOVE) and the Sweet Potatoes with Marshmallows is HEAVEN! (LOVE LOVE)
I get a side of cabbage as well and his Cornbread is always Good & Moist like a CAKE.  His wife makes the best desserts and my favorite is the Red Velvet Cake!  I have been in Phoenix for 8 years and their food is the BEST Fried Chicken and Soul Food Here!  I brought my mother here and she is a hard critic and she loved the Catfish dinner.  My coworkers enjoyed it as well.  After this review you should be visiting them IMMEDIATELY! You have NO IDEA what you are missing out on.  I love them both like family and it is a family atmosphere every time I come in.  Please take my word for it and treat yourself to this Heaven sent restaurant."}
{"text":"Great southern style food, wish they had shrimp and grits though! Fried chicken is great and cooked to order, so call ahead. The chocolate peanut butter cake is delicious too. Ribs are OK, but the cornbread is killer."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing! Delivery in Ahwatukee of fried chicken, homemade Mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes! Really good food, fast friendly delivery, good prices....can't wait to order again! We absolutely loved it! Found the place unintentionally on Eat24, and took a chance. So glad we did!!!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for a couple reasons. First and foremost taste. You can tell they seasoned the food, not crazy like but enough to know this was fresh. Brings me to my next reason. Fresh and made to order. Granted it's probably not healthy to eat it everyday but I feel I can justify it because you know the ingredients are fresh. Customer service was good too. This place isn't really big on the presentation so your good will come in a sectioned styrofoam box but you won't care about that. One thing I wasn't impressed with was the pie crust though. It was hard and not easily broken apart. Other than that this place was on point."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken!! Ordered delivery and it got here hot and yummy! Chicken was perfection. Crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The sides were good but not great! However the banana walnut cake was amazing! Definitely will come back next time in Phoenix"}
{"text":"If 5 star dining is what you are looking for this is not your place.  It's a lil divey, old, and warm in there BUT everything else about it is fantastic!  Delicious, moist, and crispy fried chicken.  Very fair prices and some of the best sweet potatoes and coleslaw I've ever had, NO JOKE!  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some amazing down home comfort food.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start this with: I'm from Louisiana originally, but don't live there anymore because [pick a reason], so I know something about good soul food, and this is the best you're going to find in Phoenix. Or most elsewhere, really.

When I tell you that if you pick their ribs up by the bone, the meat actually falls off, I mean exactly that. Melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly BBQ'd ribs. 

Baked macaroni tastes like it does when my Grandma makes it, which is damn near impossible to do. I'm sure there are people with the same level of skill, but Ezekiel's provides me with that nostalgia that others fall short of.

Their greens are perfectly cooked - they still have that satisfying crunch but they have this velvety texture to them also that is done exactly the way greens should be done. 

The people who own & operate the restaurant are as nice as the food is good. This place is a good example of what people mean when they invoke the term southern hospitality. You come in, people are happy to see you, their interactions with you are warm and welcoming rather than robotic and monotonous, and then they give you this place of food that must be what happiness tastes like. 

I'm planning on moving in about 18 months and I will come back to Phoenix just to eat here."}
{"text":"I had fried catfish and chicken with yummy mad potatoes & collard greens. Everything had just enough seasoning to add more or enjoy as is; no greasy food on my plate! Small, home style family restaurant is the way to enjoy a good meal!!
I will kindly ask restaurants I patronize to gradually change from styrofoam containers to biodegradable containers. Save our planet's soil & waterways. It take 1000 years for styrofoam to completely breakdown; sea life are choking on this material. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!
Great service, family owned. Chicken was delicious, Macaroni and cheese. 
I will be going back :)"}
{"text":"Food was great, we got chicken, corn bread, mac & cheese, and red velvet cake. So yummy! I like how the corn bread and cake were not dry at all. Though the food took a while, it was worth the wait. I think next time I go, I'll call in advance to place the order since they get busy with a lot of phone orders. I definitely recommend this place! Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I love soul food and this was a must try. From California and dropping by az for a friends baby shower.  Found it on yelp and came for the reviews.  It definitely didn't disappoint.  Friendly service,  low key location but high energy delivery! Only thing Id suggest is to order ahead of time since they make it all fresh when you order so the whole order took about 40 minutes.
Ordered fried chicken,  ribs,  baked macaroni,  collard greens, corn bread,crab cakes,  sweet potato pie, chocolate peanut butter cake,  banana walnut cake and everything was delicious. I think the gentleman in front was the owner, not sure, but he was so warm and made everyone feel welcome.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I saw this place last week for the first time.   Took a chance was more than  rewarded.   The fried chicken was home made and was off  the chart. Fried catfish was fantastic.   Get the dinner with two sides.   You won't be able to finish it.   Simply the best fried chicken and catfish place in Phoenix.   This is my go to place for comfort food.  Forget Lolo's, this is the real deal."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken. Easy location. And friendly owners. 
Is there any reason NOT to go check this truly talented food out?!"}
{"text":"Looking for some GOOD soul food. Saw this sign,  Ezekiels. So, took my family in. Lips smacking, eyes popping, drool dripping.  I was ready to tear some dam chicken Up!! Got the chicken breast, and some of the sides. The only thing I liked, was the corn bread! None of us like the chicken AT All! So, we took it home.  NO flavor, wasn't crispy, greens were plain, sweet potatoes mech,  Talapia, nasty. I'm trying to NOT be so negative. It just wasn't GOOD. 3mos later, After they've been open a few months. Decided, maybe I wasn't fair. And maybe it just wasn't a good day, that first time. SO, gave them 1 more chance....got the chicken meal. Chicken breast, tasted like it had just come out of the freezer And HADN'T thawed all the way before they fried it. It was tough, NOT crispy. It did NOT taste good. Told my fam, that I had picked it up for dinner.  They asked me why? You don't like us? I said,  come on. Let's give it another chance. They went to McDonald's. The chicken is still in the kitchen."}
{"text":"If I was eating this just based on the chicken and sweet potatoes I ordered, this would get five stars. I think this place is absolutely worth trying and the people who I assume own the place were so great! However, we waited for a really long time to get our food and the place was not packed. I think they receive alot of online orders, which might delay things for those of us eating in. My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich and Mac n cheese and loved the chicken, but he and I were underwhelmed by the watery Mac n cheese. I expected the Mac n cheese to be rich in cheese and it was more noodle than anything else. I definitely plan to come back and try other combinations of their meat and sides but I might order online first."}
{"text":"Had a craving for fried chicken this past weekend, Ezekiel's did not disappoint! Chicken was great,  my wife and one son got the crab cakes, they were happy too. My other son got the chicken sandwich,  great value and tasty! The sides are excellent. Most of us had the baked mac and cheese, which is not to be missed. I had the coallard greens, yum! The cole slaw looked good on my wife's plate, but she ate it before I had a chance to grab a forkful. 

Small place,  but homey. I'm assuming Ezekiel himself welcomed us and treated us great. We'll make the trip from south Tempe again!"}
{"text":"honestly i made a mistake when i ordered.  I wanted to try as much as i could thinking i would sample half and put the rest away for lunch the next day.  That was a mistake and i ate myself into a painful food coma.

First up was the chicken.  overall it was very tasty.  i liked that it had it's own unique taste.  i wanted to eat fried chicken that did not taste like KFC or Popeyes.  It's worth getting out of the car just for that.

Ribs - The ribs were also good.  Very meaty, very delicious.

my sides - i didn't eat much of because i was focused on the ribs and chicken

very happy i found it"}
{"text":"We were up on Warner road and I looked up Soul food in the area and I was NOT disappointed! Sweet potatoes and fried chicken are an absolute must. The food was so good that we ordered take out for the dinner after our lunch there.. the ribs and sides were all a solid hit. even the greens were good. the only thing I tried there and do not recommend  are the crab cakes. unless it's just your thing. The owner who is in the restaurant is a very nice man. His customer service is straight. Highly recommended  restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place on 5 and I don't that very often. Usually because I feel no place is that outstanding but this place for Arizona is the top would food restaurant. 
Service I give a five the gentlemen in the front is a sweet man very friendly and personable. 
After my order was placed I took a seat watched some tv and my food was out.
Now everything was hot and fresh. I began with my fried catfish, perfectly seasoned, light and flakey. No hot sauce was needed but it was great with or without. Sweet potatoes were perfect and the mac&cheese was creamy. I got an extra side of cabbage and greens mixed, which were good as well. Free refills( I had the half&half) and found myself addicted to the concoction. Overall my taste buds had been craving good soul food in Phoenix. This place hit the spot and I will be back very soon. I have been to LoLo's and Mrs.Whites, this place knocks those out the water, period."}
{"text":"I had my initial doubts about good soul food in the outskirts of ahwahtukee, but I was starving, and it was so conveniently near me.

They have the crispiest fried chicken I have ever had. It is amazing, flavorful, and so tender. Warning, the chicken comes out PIPING HOT.
One of my sides were the mashed sweet potatoes, which is hard to mess up. MMM

5/5 Would come back for some great soul food."}
{"text":"We ordered the 8 piece fried chicken and cornbread with a side of greens and carrot cake. Everything was great! This will definitely be our place when we're craving soul food."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best Mac and cheese I have ever had and the service was so kind and friendly. The owner even gave us some sweet potatoes for our Mac and cheese. Definite must visit"}
{"text":"I do my best to support local restaurants. That is the reason I took my wife and daughter there 2 months ago. 
I couldn't believe this restaurants very high ratings. Some of the highest in all valley residents. 

From our experience the food was inedible. 
The worst meal we've had in AZ. The oil temperature was too low for the chicken and catfish and the result was a train wreck. 
Possible reasons for the incredible reviews:

1. People in Harrisburg PA ( original restaurant)) don't have a clue what soul food is ????
Very possible. 

2. The reviews are from relatives, friends, people getting free meals to write incredible reviews???
Very possible. 

We won't go back nor place any credibility with Yelp restaurants reviews."}
{"text":"Usually the food never disappoints but this most recent visit had be think twice. I should have gone with my gut and gotten Mexican. I ordered the fried chicken platter with a side of macaroni and cheese and sweet potatoes. The chicken was just okay this time and the macaroni? Seemed like it was just thrown together. There wasn't a lot of cheese used, just buttered macaroni. I'm still a fan overall but in order to keep me as a customer, I'm hoping there's more consistency in the food preparation."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of buzz about this place & finally decided to try it out, especially on National Fried Chicken Day. Oh so delicious!!! I ordered the 2-piece white meat dinner & selected the baked mac&cheese & collard greens as my sides. Chicken was moist, tasty & crispy! The baked mac&cheese was yummy & the collard greens is the best that I have ever had. They are slightly sweet but with a hint of heat. Corn bread was awesome too. Call in the order so you don't have to wait, but if you don't mind the wait-the owner, Brad Carr, will have plenty to chat about that will make the wait go by fast!! I will definitely be back for more & bring any out of town visitors to experience the food!!"}
{"text":"One confession, I did not try every item on their menu, so this 5 stars is for Fried Chicken and excellent customer service.

I have brought lots of folks here after I tried their fried chicken and they all agree this is the best.  Forget about LoLo's or Mrs White.  Forget about Church's, Popeye's or even Louisana Fried Chicken.  They do not have the kind of crispy, crunchy on the outside, moist juicy on the inside that this place has.  The cook is the husband and the lady in front is his wife.  Sometimes their daughter takes orders too.  I like their service very much, they try to answer any questions you have and make very good suggestions on what to order.  In spite of being here many times, I have always ended up ordering fried chicken as I would bring someone new each time and we end up doing the 8 or 12 piece, and have not once been disappointed.

I do have to say that you might want to call ahead before you head over there and order.  even if you are eating in. :)  That is how their chicken taste so good, they do not have a heat lamp like you see at church's or kfc where the chicken gets dried up.  they only cook it when u order it :)  so don't give them a one star cause their food makes u wait and u get all angry and unhappy and have the bitter taste of bile in your mouth ruining your taste ;)

so enjoy it and check out their carrot cake, its not too sweet and very delicious and a good end to your meal of yum yum chicken !"}
{"text":"Holy cow - the fried chicken is amazing. I've been missing authentic Southern fried chicken since I moved to Phoenix from Atlanta 6 years ago ... Im so glad I moved into Ezekiel's delivery area! (You can order their food from Amazon Prime Restaurants - hooray!)"}
{"text":"I had a business trip to Tempe and we wanted some good soul food. We looked at the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Excellent food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The experience here is similar to Jerry Seinfeld ordering soup.  Whatever you do, don't offend or confuse the order taker.  The food is good.  The service is horrific.  This place is not worth the stress or hassle.  I'm hoping they learn how to take care of their customers and treat them with respect.  I guess Soul food means food with an attitude."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  My review comes from the perspective of both a former small business owner and as a consumer.  

We are new to Phoenix and were looking for another place to add to our neighborhood haunts when I don't feel like cooking.  We got a coupon that read \"best fried chicken in Arizona.\"  I don't fry anything, and hubby was ready for some good fried chicken, so we went.

We walked in.  There were no other customers.  The greeting/welcome was non-existent.  The young woman at the counter would probably have preferred being somewhere else.  Turned out she is the owners' daughter.  We ordered at the counter then went to get a table.  The tables all had tell-tale signs of not being wiped down completely.  And I would refer to the ambience as spartan, though the paintings were interesting.  When the food came out, I was surprised that it was on styro to-go containers with plastic knives and forks.

I got the crab cakes (good but not great, $11.99 with 2 sides).  The sides were better than the crab cakes, but at $11.99, that some really expensive mac and slaw.  Hubby got the dark fried chicken ($8.99) and the same sides as I.  That's a lot to pay for two small pieces of dark meat, again making the mac and slaw pretty pricey.

The owner, who had been cooking, came out from the back toward the end of our experience and was quite congenial.  I hope his business makes it, but it won't be because the food is a good value for the price, nor because the customer service is good (it's virtually non-existent).  

Bottomline for us:  For the $$, there should be clean tables, service staff coming to the table, and real plates and flatware.  Hubby said when he wants fried chicken again, he'll just go to Church's or KFC...  We won't return."}
{"text":"Not just Locally Owned..........FAMILY Owned & Operated.  Ahwatukee needs more of this!!  

SOLIDS:  Fried Chicken Sandwich came with a really nice piece of boneless chicken, fresh piping hot. Collard greens, cooked right (not mushy). Sweet Potato Mash and Mac n Cheese were good sides for the meat.  
Loved the hot sauce , just the right mix of vinegar and pepper to offset the plump catfish.  We could tell the oil was fresh, the food did not have any kind of \"old fryer\" flavor - it tasted FRESH Fried!!

Don't go in there in a Hurry - good soul food takes some time to cook.  Get a sweet tea and set awhile.  Kind of reminded me of a family reunion I went to in Mississippi, just good home food.  Brought home mini sweet potato pie and some choco cake with pnut butter frosting YUM YUM."}
{"text":"Food was great. The fried chicken recipe was delightful! Friendly service. This is not really a fast food place. It took about 10-15 mins. so plan accordingly.... but was for sure worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pretty good! The food was done fairly quickly. I had the crab cakes combo with sides of mac and cheese and collard greens. The mac and cheese was like being at home on Thanksgiving...omg soooo delightful! The greens were just ok..nothing special. Crab cakes were huge! Tasted a little fishy but good enough that I finished them haha. Overall, I will probably come back here JUST for the mac and cheese cause it's that good."}
{"text":"Ok I was referred to this place by a friend because I posted that \"I would like to go to Lolo's on Facebook\" came in the ladies are not super friendly and welcoming but they are nice if you try to strike up a conversation.  The cook was really nice and welcoming and he's in the back. I had a two piece and sweet potatoes..... one word No! The chicken was good but my mom could have made that at home. They did not have cool aid which was very disappointing to me because I was craving that. I think they can do better and I really hope they do."}
{"text":"Great chicken and VERY VERY hot.  It was tues and the Mac and cheese was dry and feel it left over from weekend. Sweet potatoes - SWEET I'll have to come back and give it another try.  I know it can't happen but this meal was good and interesting and would have enjoyed it more on a nice plate but by the time I get it home to plate it would be too cold.and far less enjoyable"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! How your fried chicken and shrimp are still crispy and hot when delivered is beyond me but this place rocks. Answering machine says they're closed for the rest of February for a medical emergency. Hope they reopen soon and everyone is well!"}
{"text":"This is the best mom and pop shop I have been too in AZ.  They are always genuinely warm and attentive.   At any point a great conversation in the restaurant can start.  Wonderful at home feeling.
The food is utterly amazing.  It is a little bit pricier than I would have expected,  but the food is certainly worth it."}
{"text":"It wasn't what I previously experienced. I ended up throwing my food away. The people that are always there were not and that may have something to do with it. The food was nasty \"that day!\""}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great price. 

I like it a lot. The fried chicken does blow LoLo's out of the water!! Also blows Mrs. White's out of the water as well! The baked Mac and cheese is also very good.

Employees and owner are also very nice and pleasant to be around! Very homelike!

Also they have Apple Pay, I want to bring her some Apple Pay stickers that she can put up so others know!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken and the baked Mac is the best I have ever had. The owner is a great guy who truly makes you feel like he has welcomed you right into his home. This place has become a regular spot for my family. A hidden gem !"}
{"text":"Stopped by here last week while I was in town for work. Place wasn't very busy so got to order right away. Service was incredibly friendly and laid back which was really nice to experience. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich which was just okay in my opinion. The chicken was kind of dry. Definitely didn't wow me. Also ordered mashed potatoes which were okay as well. The positives are that the food was cheap and the service was really friendly. Will come back here and try something else."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, the cabbage was amazing. The Mac n cheese was less to be desired, seems like the noodles were too hot when the egg went in and it scrambled it. Not cheese enough, but the chicken was crispy."}
{"text":"Service was a slow, I ordered fried chicken based on reviews  that stated it was so delicious, the chicken was extremely under seasoned, Mac and cheese and sweet potatoes were extremely goood.  It leads me to believe that different cooks are fixing the  food. I might give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"I had a taste for soul food, so I hit up Ezekiel's, because they have a good reputation. I had a Veggie Plate, consisting of collard greens, cabbage, sweet potato soufflé, macaroni and cheese and cornbread. Every single morsel of it was delicious!  I was trying to lay off the meat, but I caught sight of another customer's fried chicken, and I just had to get some - once again, they didn't disappoint! I felt like I was eating at my grandma's Southern table, and no other soul food joint in the valley even remotely comes close. I'll be back constantly!"}
{"text":"I had the 2 piece fried chicken with mac & cheese and green beans. My entire dinner was super tasty. The  chicken was incredibly crunchy with a moist interior. The mac & cheese is baked so it has wonderful crispy edges. The green beans were perfect, just like my Grandmother from Oklahoma would cook them.  I will definitely go back for another round."}
{"text":"Awesome family Southern style home cooking. I had the fried chicken breast and wing, cornbread, cole slaw, and mac n cheese ($11.99). My friend had ribs, cornbread, mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes ($12.99). My friend's husband had the fried catfish, mashed potatoes and gravy, cornbread and cole slaw ($10.99).  The food was delicious and the portion size was huge. I had enough for two meals. 
Support our local businesses and give Ezekiel's a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is so good! We found this spot while searching for\"soul food\" on Yelp! We will definitely be back and highly recommend this little gem of a place!"}
{"text":"Hands down...THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN!!!! I absolutely love this place and the owners!!! Have never had a bad meal from this place!!!! The peanut butter chocolate cake is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start . The sides are amazing.  Mac and cheese taste like home cook baked (delicious ) . Okay now for the fried chicken . Lord help me lol . It's the best . Family own . Wonderful people . I stay downtown Phx a lil ways from here . But worth the trip !!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife Faye and a group of neighbors, Sunday evening.  Had a delightful conversation with Joel, the group organizer.  He is a southern guy with a delightful personality, which made our dinner more interesting.  I ate fried chicken breast and fried catfish, with green beans and collard greens as my side, both needed more seasoning and smoke, and my wife had the chicken, a bit overcooked and dry also,  and with sweet potatoes (excellent),  and mac-n-cheese, which needed some warmth, as it was served tepid.  It was all served with cornbread that was quite crumbly and tasteless. Two fountain drinks and a bit over $30 was the bill.  Should have been a bit less, but was fun none the less!  I would rate it a 3-star meal."}
{"text":"I love eating here, they have some of the best soul food in the valley! My \"go to\" is the two piece dark meat with collard greens and Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"After seeing this on Check Please we were excited to try it. I don't think they were ready for us. The place is dirty the help in the kitchen didn't know what to do. No deserts food was so-so. We drove over from Sun Lakes and we were so disappointed will not go back.  Chicken was dry but had a good coating."}
{"text":"Catfish is definitely great. They have one of the best baked Mac and cheese in town. Food is all prepared fresh right when you order it. Wait time is a bit long, but well worth."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried catfish dinner with collard greens, baked mac&cheese, and cornbread.

The fish was breaded perfectly and cooked to perfection. The greens were spicy and not overcooked. The mac&cheese was chewy and creamy in the familiar soul food style. The cornbread was sweet and crumbly, almost a dessert.

This is not someone's \"take\" on soulfood. It is the genuine article executed extremely well. I haven't had anything like it since I left Detroit 7 years ago and am lucky to have found this way to get my fix."}
{"text":"I'm from the South and I can say this was some of the best Chicken and vegetables I have had by far. They cook the chicken to order so it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp. If you are in a hurry call your order in and it will be hot when you pick it up. The owner is very friendly and the food is great. I don't eat fried chicken usually cause it's dry. But this chicken was moist and hot. The skin crispy and flavorful. We will be back."}
{"text":"I give 4 stars for the sides- sweet potato was amazing!!!! I wish they had boneless fried chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent. Black owned. Food is unbelievably good. The catfish was so bomb! On top of that, good customer service!"}
{"text":"If you are from the east coast and have been on the never ending search for Crab Cakes in the Valley of The Sun...look no further.  Crab Cakes reminds me of Baltimore Inner Harbor!. The ribs ( not much of a meat eater myself) the hubby got... but.... I must say...... he did not end up with many for himself good thing we share.  The sweet potatoes..perfection."}
{"text":"The decor was.... wow. I am all for reusing perfectly usable furniture but just rolling some interior house paint over it doesn't really appeal to me. Some of the seating was difficult to use because the tables are so close together. It is apparent the restaurant is family run and the patrons love to go there. 

The owner was very friendly to everyone. It was a very busy Saturday evening. It was actually very chaotic. I felt like I never got the full attention of the cashier, but everyone seemed to be happy to be there. There were a lot of regular customers there. They could have used additional help. 

I felt like I received a large portion of food. I ordered 2 piece white chicken ($11.99) and 2 piece catfish ($10.99) dinners. Each came with two sides and cornbread. In addition I decided to add one crab cake on the side just to try it out. I was quite shocked when my one side crab cake cost $8.99! I cold have gotten the crab cake combo for $10.99 and it included one side and a drink. Overall I spent $38 on dinner. 

I loved the macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes and cornbread. I would consider going there again for those. The other two sides were collared greens and mashed potatoes. They were average. I personally felt my chicken was a bit over cooked and dry. The crab cake was good but not $8.99 good. The catfish was huge and flakey. 

Overall I did not have a bad experience, but I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"These folks were recommended by another foodie, and this was my first visit with them. The owner is a big, happy gent, and didn't spare the conversation. I love that, when the owner/family is on-site and it's part of the experience. The wall to the east is adorned with family pics, and the west wall is covered with mostly historic photos. Definitely enough to keep your eyes busy while awaiting the goodness.

The hand-written menu is above the counter on chalkboard, and he pointed out the combo special to me. One piece each of catfish and fried-chicken(any piece) with two sides, cornbread and drink. Knowing the starch-load of the cornbread, I opted for both the seasoned cabbage and greens for my sides. He assured me they were both homemade. He also mentioned Kool-Aid as a drink option, and...so...you're damn right that's what I had to pour, LOL.

The whole combo came out great. Chicken thigh was just the right crispness and lightly seasoned. No batter, just spices. The fish was of course nicely covered in golden cornmeal batter, as God intended. There wasn't much seasoning that I could sense, making me reach for the Trappey's Louisiana sauce probably faster than I otherwise would. However, the right crunch, and moist inside.

The seasoned cabbage was whole leaf, huge pieces, not chopped or shredded up. The greens were not quite as leafy, LOL, and definitely had a hit of sugar which the owner confirmed for me. Both were yummy and needed nothing to enjoy. Cornbread was wrapped in plastic, but perhaps that's why it retained a good amount of moisture. It stood-up to buttering without falling to crumbles like so many recipes seem to do. I liked it. 
At 12.99, the value for the dollar was there, with good company to chat with.

Now, the folks in Chandler and the Tuke who were making the drive further north into town have a much more convenient option."}
{"text":"Well I perhaps expected to much as we walked into this establishment. The wife and I decided to come out here because she read that this was the place to come to have some good SOUL FOOD. The first problem I had was that the place was warm...guess the AC wasn't working. The young lady at the counter wanted us to wait while she finished writing something down from her cellphone. I found that funny because there were only two other people in the place and guess whatever was on her cellphone was more important.

So anyway after looking at menu which didn't have red beans and rice.....black eyed peas.....or peach cobbler....we decided to order. I had the fried chicken (white meat only) with the mac n cheese.....collard greens.....large drink.....and cornbread. Chicken was juicy and hot....mac n cheese was good....collard greens were perfect.....cornbread was a little sweet for my taste but it was decent nonetheless. I had red velvet cake for Dessert and that really allowed me to look over the condition of the establishment and the customer service because the cake was REALLY GOOD. 

Make sure you print out the coupons from there website.....I have read other reviews where people were having issues printing them. They are not actual coupons.....all you need to do is just print the entire page(s) and bring it to the restaurant....they will honor those. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you receive but Dulan's Soul Food Kitchen in Los Angeles.....and LOLO's right here in Scottsdale AZ are much better choices for Soul Food. Overall I wanted to give this locale 4 stars....but the customer service and the fact that it was very uncomfortable in there caused me to stick with the 3 stars. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"This is how good the fried chicken at Ezekiel's is......

I don't even care for fried chicken that much in general. I would say in the past 10 years Ive had fried chicken maybe 4 times including one time at Lo Lo's. Fried chicken doesn't excite me at all, even at places like Lo Lo's where it is definitely pretty decent fried chicken, I never had any desire whatsoever to go back.

Now with that said...the fact that I don't even like fried chicken that much in general...I can unequivocally say that Ezekiels fried chicken is one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. I literally plan like a week ahead for when I'm going to go out of my way and go get my next fix of fried chicken. I'm a huge foodie and love eating at all different sorts of places...burgers....pizza....tacos....steak....BBQ....and its like these other restaurants offering other good food in Phoenix don't even exist to me anymore.

I don't know how anyone eating here can give this place less than 4 stars. They must have done so much meth that they can't even taste straight anymore, because the chicken is absolutely outstanding. In fact, the people who give this place less than 4 stars should all be rounded up and shipped off to the Hawaiian island of Molokai like they did with all the people who had leprosy decades ago....except the new colony will be for morons!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I've been here twice and nothing short of a perfect experience each time. I loved the food and the service is wonderful. I've only been in PHX for about a month so, I'm glad to have found a spot that I can rely on for great soul food. Mac and cheese is delicious and the cornbread...best I've ever had."}
{"text":"fried chicken, yes, maybe the best or close to it??? beats lolos, whites, can't even compare to kfc or churches. its fresh, piping hot great crunch moist n juicy meat, the owner is really nice, but sometimes when he's not there the people are not the nicest but as long as i get my chicken its all good! sides are ok, i get fries n the mac n cheese that i really like. and the yelp coupon makes it the best deal around! i did try there ribs too and i do like them but not what you go here for, i would get them again tho for sure."}
{"text":"Ezekiel's is amazing! I had the chicken and mac n cheese which were by far the best I've ever had and my husband had the catfish and coleslaw Can't believe I haven't found this place sooner! Ordered through the online app on Yelp and when I got there to pick it up, the food was hot and fresh! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is another rare violation of my own personal policy of \"two visits before a stellar review.\" In this case, I must tell any and all readers that I have discovered the VERY BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN PHOENIX.

Ezekiel's is transplanted from York, Pennsylvania and it is our good fortune that they landed in Ahwatukee. A little short on ambiance (can you imagine old fashioned Formica topped luncheonette table ambiance) it really doesn't matter. Take it home; it seems everyone else is, based on the customers there on a Saturday evening taking theirs home.

Ezekiel's has managed to do with fried chicken what Lolo's, Mrs. Whites and others here in Phoenix just can't measure up to. The cooked to order Fried Chicken is served up golden crispy on the outside, yet still light, without that heavy batter so many insist on using and no oily taste whatsoever. Ezekiel's is doing it right and in my opinion, better than almost any others I have had, even better than the now world famous Willie Mae's Scotch House in New Orleans. In addition to that golden crust outside, each piece is tender and juicy on the inside. The breast portion is as big a chicken breast as you have even seen! The only drawback with that large a breast is that I found I ran out of \"crispy skin\" long before I was done with the luscious white meat. Absolutely flawless fried chicken and reasonably priced at 8 pieces for $10.99 (with two servings of cornbread) and 12 pieces for $13.99 (with three servings of cornbread). Price really doesn't make a difference, for fried chicken of this quality, I would pay more!

The normal \"sides\" you expect to find in a \"Soul Food Restaurant\" are here, with collard greens, fried cabbage, sweet potatoes, potato and macaroni salad, etc. My choice, based on the recommendation of the very nice lady who took my order (a daughter in this family owned establishment) was Baked Macaroni and Cheese and it did not disappoint.

I am going to find it hard to try their other specialties (Catfish, Tilapia, Ribs, Crab Cakes and Salmon Cakes) because I will NOT be able to resist the fried chicken. Maybe I will try the others for lunch.

Get there and when you do, chances are you will find me waiting for my next order of the VERY BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN PHOENIX!"}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken!  Always made to order,  definitely our family favorite.  
The owners are very down to earth,  sweet little couple.  I give them an A+ for delicious,  juicy,  and  always fresh FRIED CHICKEN!  Great food and great customer service is the key to success.  They absolutely did both in my opinion.  Keep up the great work and we will see you soon!"}
{"text":"Real Deal...next to Zzeeks pizza, map is off.
Grape and red cool-aide. Huge pieces of chicken, catfish is in cornmeal. Mashed potatoes with Brown Gravy, fridge full of homemade mini desserts, corn bread. Enough hot sauce for everyone. Dang..."}
{"text":"Best soul food in the valley!
Everything I had was awesome! Sweet potatoes are to die for.
Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Let's get something straight... Ezekiel's is the BEST soul food restaurant this side of the east coast. Everything on their menu is excellent. 

The food was so good I had to remember I was not sitting in my Aunt Ruth's kitchen. 

Brad and his family are passionate about making their last plate just like their first plate. Talk about quality and consistency and you're talking about Ezekiel's. 

If you're not from Arizona and are looking for the real deal, Ezekiel's is the spot for you. 

Be there or be square."}
{"text":"It's rare to have an experience at a restaurant where you immediately feel like a member of the family but that was exactly what happened here. Family run and the food was delicious, fried chicken perfectly seasoned, fried catfish was piping hot (major plus), Mac n cheese and sweet potato soufflé delicious. The owners were so sweet, I am truly impressed! So if you want down home cooking with down home service, this is your place!!!"}
{"text":"Moist, delicious chicken, Mac n cheese and cabbage are my favorites. Fish is really good, too. If I want fried chicken I order from Ezekiel's.
Edit: A little disappointment tonight. Ordered delivery and usually get chicken but decided to change it up with shrimp. My advice, don't. They looked and tasted like grocery store shrimp.
Also the cornbread came in muffin form and didn't have the taste or nice moist texture of a piece from a whole pan.
So far will still order for their chicken and fried fish."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken and mac n cheese  is on point the cornbread is amazing and I don't even like cornbread good job"}
{"text":"We discovered this place by accident when I was doing some reconnaissance on the pizza place a few doors down. Looked at the yelp reviews and decided to give it a shot. 
The place is pretty bare bones inside. Counter service and they call your name when the food is ready. We both had fried chicken and thought it was very good. Be warned that it takes a good 15 minutes but that is because they make the chicken fresh. You can tell because it is rocket hot when you get it. I also had collard greens which had a little sweetness to them which I had not had before. Tasty, but I do like it without sweetness so I can go nuts with the hot pepper vinegar. The Mac and cheese I bet is outstanding right from the oven. This was unfortunately a little clumpy but again you could tell that it was homemade. 
We did not try the desserts, but I am sure we will be back. The folks behind the counter were very friendly and I think the prices are quite reasonable. 
I thought it was a little unprofessional for the girl at the counter to be sitting and reading or texting. I would think there is something more that she could do, or at least check on the guests to see how they are doing. 
All in all, I was pleased. This is probably not quite as good as lo lo's but it is cheaper, closer and there is no long wait to be seated. I hope they do well here."}
{"text":"Love this place...but be ready for a few things. If you are looking for People watching and the game, this might not be the place for you. If you're looking for the Best Fried Chicken and Sides in Arizona, you've found it. 

The owners are great people who really know how to make you feel welcome. They're smiles are as big as their portions. You'll fall in love with the fried chicken and some nights I lay awake thinking about it. Yes, you can't have it all the time but its worth the cheat every now and then. 

The atmosphere is pretty plain here but the food more than makes up for it. Drink selection is sparse but plenty of items on the menu to fill you up. I recommend the Fried Chicken, Potato Salad, Collards, Mac and Cheese. 

Stop reading this review and go here, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"6 of us went there and ordered variety of dishes from the menu.  Food was ok but nothing special.  Most of times, Yelp rating is accurate but I do not see how this place is rated 4 plus stars.  I doubt I will be going back there."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken,totally worth the wait. Most sides are yummy, but the greens are the best."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing! The fried chicken is out of this world, the sides were all incredible (I'm looking at you Mac & cheese and sweet potatoes!), and the desert cakes were fresh! Amazing spot and amazing people!"}
{"text":"We ate enough for 8 people but it was just the two of us  I love me some soul food, so when I find a good one I eat like a football player. Too bad I ate most of the food before I had a chance to post it but it was all delicious. Get out there and support your local small businesses!! They can't survive without our support. Oh!! And finish up with that amazing strawberry cake"}
{"text":"Wow! All I can say if wow. I had this for the first time on Friday and it was the best soul food I've ever had.

The chicken was amazing, the sweet potatos were great, the mac and cheese was perfect and the red velvet cake was the best I've had.

The only complaint I have is it's too close to my home in Phoenix. That's like putting a crack addict next to a crack house! 

All kidding aside, the portions were huge so remember that one meal could actually feed two adults. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I'm not sure its the *best* fried chicken I've ever had, but its pretty damn close.   They cook it to order and its fresh, the skin is excellent and I got a feeling whoever is in this kitchen knows what they're doing.   

The sides are good:  I had the baked mac and cheese with the cornbread.    The Mac and cheese was excellent, the cornbread was ok. 

Great little soul food place.   I sorta have the feeling they're resting on their reputation a little bit, but overall good food!   I wanna come back and try the ribs.  

If I was craving fried chicken, I'd swing wide and drive across the valley to come to this place. You can't really go wrong.   

Hell Yes Ezekiels!"}
{"text":"We almost always go here for fried chicken. It's reasonably priced and leagues better than KFC. My only complaint is that the fried chicken can be oily most times. But still, really good."}
{"text":"My friend found this place and I've been looking for some good soul food! We ordered pickup and ran errands before heading home and the food was still nice and hot! I recommend the fish, mac and cheese and sweet potatoes and every thing else!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness I found this place.  I was worried I was going to have to suffer out the rest of my existence in Phoenix without decent fried chicken.  Family owned, friendly, accommodating, and fantastic food are all things I love about many different restaurants, but when they come together in one place, you can bet I'll be a regular.  I happened to be in the Ahwatukee/S Phoenix area for work at the end of the day and found myself checking Yelp for places nearby to pick up dinner.  Ezekiel's popped up, the few reviews were extremely positive, and who am I to turn down chicken if everyone likes it?  

I've been here about 3 times now (with many more visits in the near future), and the food has been consistent, flavorful, hearty, and filling.  The chicken is juicy on the inside with a wonderful lightly crispy skin; I found myself licking the bones for more flavor when I finished off the meat.  The cornbread was the best side, with just the right amount of crumbly graininess, and I would highly recommend ordering extra.  I wasn't too impressed with the green beans (slightly soggy and overcooked), but I refuse to let that detract from the main dish: chicken.  You go to a fried chicken place for the fried chicken, not for vegetables. 

I didn't find the wait too long, though I usually order ahead of time and go pick it up.  I appreciate food cooked to order, rather than food precooked and sitting under a heat lamp.  Yes, more, please!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I ordered the 2 Piece White Chicken with 2 sides and everything was superb! The chicken was crispy and moist (not dry at all!) the collard greens were great, and the macaroni and cheese was perfect! The pricing is a little off from what they have on the board vs what the have on there flyers/menus but nothing a little updating can't do. I definitely give this restaurant 5 stars and recommend you try this place! Excellent soul food!"}
{"text":"I was craving fried chicken so of course I went to Yelp and Ezekiel's popped up. After looking at a few pics of the chicken, mac and cheese and cornbread we hopped in the car and made our way over.

We both ordered the chicken dinner (dark) with mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole. The dinners also come with a piece of cornbread.

The food took a little bit to come out but when it did it was piping hot so you know it's freshly made. The chicken was actually too hot to eat at first so we dove into the sides. The mac and cheese was solid, nice crispy layer on top, not mushy at all. But the sweet potato casserole was fantastic! Big chunks of sweet potato, fluffy marshmallow, mmm, mmm mmm! So good. 

Once the chicken cooled down we quickly made out way through our two pieces each. The coating had good flavor, it wasn't too thick, and the chicken was nice and juicy.    

A man came out from the back at one point and I assume he was the owner as he was going around talking to people. He was very friendly and knew many people by name so this is definitely the kind of place that has regulars. I can see why. Next time my fried chicken craving kicks in again, I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Crab cakes we're good, greens we're also fresh and good. We don't eat pork or red meat so I'm glad they were vegetarian style . Will be back on my next visit"}
{"text":"The Customer Service was Awsome, the Catfish and Tilapia Dinners were good! I just didn't like the potato salad, I also had the Red Velvet Cake, it was heavy and had not taste, the frosting didn't have much if any cream cheese in it, that would have helped the cake taste better. I think I'll try a pie next time. I'm a baker myself so I'm sorta picky when it comes to bake goods! The price is good too for all you get."}
{"text":"Love this place! We usually order by phone and pick up our food up, they are always extremely friendly and helpful; sometimes I call and my kids are loud in the background they are always patient and kind. WE absolutely love their food, My husband loves the yams, as I do; however, my favorite is the collard greens. Chicken and fish is always cooked perfectly, Nom Nom!"}
{"text":"The best Southern comfort in AZ... Get Tilapia, candy yams and ma n cheese. It puts a smile on my face every time."}
{"text":"SO impressed with their food! Best cornbread and red velvet cake ever. The catfish I took home was HUGE (and tasty) and was almost too big for my take home box. I'll
eat there every week!"}
{"text":"Ryan was craving fried chicken, so we searched for what seemed to be the best place for it. Ezekiel's seemed like our best bet and it was a great choice! 

The woman behind the counter was very sweet and friendly. We ordered the 8 piece fried chicken meal with 3 pieces of corn bread and a side of mac n' cheese. The fried chicken was delicious--not too oily or heavily breaded--and the corn bread....to die for!! Wish there was some jalapeno in it, but they probably don't do that to cater to the bigger population.

It's a little far from us, but whenever we have a future craving for friend chicken, we'll know to come to Ezekiels! I need to try their crab cakes..."}
{"text":"Great to see a locally owned, authentic foods restaurant.   Good food, good people. Good pies too!"}
{"text":"This was such a great dining experience. The fried chicken is made fresh when you order! Mac and cheese and sweet potatoes were delicious. The owner was so sweet...I felt like I was with family! Can't wait to come back and try some other items off the menu."}
{"text":"Wow! Let me say that again...WOW!!!  This place is so good and it's going to be the cause of me gaining a million pounds since it's so close to my house. This was my first time here, I had no clue that this place was here. The owner told me that they've been here for two years!! I've been missing out for two years! This place is located in the Bashas shopping center, it's sort of behind the Taco Bell. So skip that junk and head straight on over to Ezekiel's!!

I had the Fried Chicken Dinner that comes two pieces of chicken, two sides and cornbread. I got their mac and cheese and french friends. I can hear my arteries clogging, but it's worth it!! The chicken breast was huge and it was super juicy. The breading tasted delicious and crispy. The cornbread. Super super moist, sweet and tasty. I really can't tell you how amazing this chicken is, words don't do it justice. You have to come experience this fried goodness for yourself. The mac and cheese will make your toes curl. No joke. I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I'm as serious as a heat attack. They make that delicious cheesy goodness there and it's baked. \"whaaaa?!\" you say. yup. It's baked there. The fries were really good too. I don't know what sort of fairy dust they sprinkled on them, but they had me at spud. 

The owners are so friendly and easy going. They made you feel welcome and knew how to treat a customer. 

If you want some real good food, I mean some REALLY good food, your search is over, my friends. I must warn you, your taste buds will never be the same. This is like taking the red pill...there's no going back. Your eyes will be opened to what good soul food is all about."}
{"text":"Excellent soul food that taste delicious. Their customer service was fabulous too. They are a better than Lolos Chicken and Waffles in my opinion"}
{"text":"My daughter and I spotted this gem and thought--why not?--so glad I did.  I'm a dessert person...gotta have it after every meal...but this food is so good I don't need dessert (did I just say that?) The chicken, ribs, fish, and all the sides...cornbread--I cannot get enough of this place.  It is now a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"I came here with expectation of the best fried chicken ever. sadly i always have high expectations. I got 2 piece fried chicken dinner with mac n cheese and coleslaw.
The coleslaw was warm, but only because of exposure to the other hot items. they should put cold items in separate containers. the mac and cheese unfortunately was not up to par, the cheese was cooled down to the point it was stuck together and not coating the actual macaroni, so it was boiled macaroni with some cheese in it. 

the chicken was delish tho. very good breading and very crunchy. i would come back and try some of their other items for sure."}
{"text":"First time ever stopping by here after googling best fried chicken. 

Like always, i yelp all the places i go to before i walk in. 
Most of the reviews were good so i was pretty excited. 
I also saw the $10 for $20 deal so i thought, perfect! 

When i walked in, this place looked like a small family place. Which is nice since most of small food joints like his has the best food! 

I showed the guy at the counter the coupon from yelp...he asked me why i bought it? And told me why i gave money to yelp instead of giving it to him...haha. Why offer coupons if you dont want people to use it? 
This made me feel uncomfortable...

I ordered the chicken with the baked macaroni and cole slaw. 
I must say the chicken and the corn bread was really good, but the sides were pretty bland. If i do come back here again, ill probably skip the sides."}
{"text":"Ribs-The meat slid right off the bones. Very tender. Flavor was average.

Mac n Cheese- consistency left me wanting. Chunks of cheese were next to chunks of noodles. Good flavor though.

Cornbread was awesome!

Friendly staff"}
{"text":"How are you going to deliver $30 worth of food to a hotel and not provide a knife and fork. Ridiculous! Don't bother ordering delivery!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Nothing fancy about this place, it's definitely a home cooked meal type. Food was decent but it took a bit too long to get it."}
{"text":"My husband stopped in to pick up some food for us. This southern girl was craving some down home cooking. It's not been easy to find good much less tolerable. The mac and cheese is just like my momma makes. (Born and raised in Atlanta, GA) The cornbread was moist and delicious. The catfish was good, would like a little less breading. Owners were friendly and it was nice to be more than just a number. Bonus: my husband saw a Cardinal player eating lunch when he went in there. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken was crispy and juicy lots of flavor. They have the best bake beans I ever tasted. Made me feel like I was back down south."}
{"text":"Came late so I ate light. Chicken was moist and staff is extremely friendly. Loved it and next time I'm getting a bigger plate. So much on the menu I want to try"}
{"text":"Live in the area but made my first trip to Ezekiel's. It definitely won't be my last! I ordered the Catfish dinner. The 2 catfish filets that were HUGE. It was crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. I also had the Green beans which were awesome as well as the Mac and cheese. I want crazy about the Mac and cheese but everything else was unbelievable! The portions, even their desserts are much larger than normal.

The staff was the family who own the restaurant. They're very cordial and helpful as well as good cooks! They really appreciate your business. They don't take it for granted as many others do. It's not going to be my last trip here. I can't wait to try their chicken as well as ribs!"}
{"text":"The reviews on this place was spot on.  Good food and friendly people.

Used the Yelp app to find a place for dinner near our hotel and this was top of the list.  My son just got his braces so he was all for mash potatoes and baked mac and cheese.

We get greeted when we walk in and asked if we been here before.  We say no and get a quick breakdown of the menu.

We decide on 2 catfish dinner combos, 1 chicken dinner combo and a kids plate.  Cool thing is they have a sign that says food is made to order so it may take up to 20 mins.  I am cool with that especially when they have the warning.

Food comes out piping hot.  If you can be patient let it cool down or dig into the cornbread or sides.  We got green beans, baked mac n cheese, mash potatoes with gravy, and potato salad.  All of them good but the potato salad and the baked mac n cheese were my favorites.  So tasty.  I think I would be good with just those 2 sides.

Once I could hold onto the chicken and fish, I dug right in.  The catfish fillets were huge and covered with breading.  Crispy outside and very moist on the inside.  Very good.  Chicken is lightly breaded and perfectly golden.  Again moist and crispy.  I like the touch of pepper that is part of the coating.  I love my hot sauce so I had to put some Louisiana hot sauce on my chicken.  Mmmmmmmm.

We got there at 630pm and only ones there.  In the hour we were there, the phone was constantly off the hook and the place was half full by the time we left.  

I get how people are giving grief about the decor but c'mon, it's a southern fried food restaurant.  It didn't bother me and the family.  This family owned restaurant is no joke.  

Skip the regular fried chicken place and check these guys out."}
{"text":"I found me some soul, some sweet (potato) salvation in the form of sweet potato pie and fried chicken at Ezekiel's!  The menu has all your soulful favorites such as fried catfish, chicken, ribs, with delicious sides like Mac and cheese, collard greens, and cole slaw. Everything is made fresh from scratch, served with a friendly smile. 

I had the fish and chicken combo ($10.99), which includes your choice of tilapia or catfish,  and any piece of chicken. I chose the catfish with breast and was fully satisfied. The catfish had a crunchy, crispy cornmeal crust with moist, tender, delectable catfish. The fried chicken was superbly seasoned and battered, with very tender meat. The combo includes 2 sides and a piece of cornbread. The collard greens were a warm embrace of tender, smoky, slightly sweet vegetables. The cole slaw was creamy, tangy, and tasted good (But not as good as those collard greens!). 

The only little hiccup was that one person received mac and cheese as a side instead of baked beans. Since he ended up finishing the entire plate, I don't think he seemed to mind though.  :) Also, the food is made on the spot, which means it might take a little bit to get it out to you. But don't worry, it's well worth any wait, because they are infusing your food with a special little bit of heart and soul :) 

The owners are incredibly nice and sweet. Definitely a great place to fill up on Southern eats."}
{"text":"Best chicken in town hands down. Sides are top notch and to this day I have not experienced a bad meal/service. Top notch family owned restaurant in which you always feel welcome. All I can say is enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best souls food spots in Arizona hands down. The food taste just like home. Their sweet potatoes brings back so much memories reminding me of my grandmother. As for their baked macaroni/fried chicken it's something delicious, a must try. This will be my number one got to spot for comfort soul food."}
{"text":"Great food with that back home country flavor. Being from the mid west it is good to have a place that taste like home."}

{"text":"Finally visited here today. Thought I'd write a review so I just typed in soul food and Eziekels pops up. Let me tell you this place has the best fried chicken I have had in a long long time. Collard greens and Mac n cheese OMG yum. They treat you like family and I can tell you this go there now so you can say I went there before they got popular. Yea it's that good!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally found a \"Soul Food\" restaurant in AZ. Ezekiel's shocked me. My food was made right after ordering (Yes, you heard correctly) No heating lamps or tin pans with burners underneath them. I ordered 2piece chicken Dinner, Collard Greens and Baked Mac & Cheese with Corn Bread. It was ALL good... everything was fresh. No greasy, oily, nothing. Will I, Should I; tell my friends and family ABSOLUTELY!!! Will, I return? of course there's more items on the menu LOL (-;"}
{"text":"Grabbed a two piece fried chicken dinner with the baked mac and potato salad to go. The chicken was perfectly crisp and the inside juicy. Straight to the point seasoning, nothing stood out in terms of it but not a terrible point. The baked mac wasn't my cup of tea, the texture didn't make it my favorite side. The potato salad on the other hand was delish! I loved the bits of egg. Bonus points for the scrumptious cornbread. It had the perfect crumble and moisture, yum! 

Friendly customer service is always a win here. I'd love to try their catfish and ribs next time!"}
{"text":"Husband and wife team that were very friendly to me when I came in. Food is good! Waited awhile for my order but the owner was apologetic. Cakes awesome!"}
{"text":"Tried Ezekiels for the first time tonight and all I have to say is WOW! The fried chicken was outstanding and the green beans and mac n cheese were very good too. Will definitely be back to try more of what they have to offer!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was awful!  My husband ordered the crab cakes - they were fishy and tasted like they were from a can,  I had the fried catfish.  It was fair - coating was just cornmeal.  Very dry and tasteless.  The sides were also bland - coleslaw was the best although very sweet.  Cornbread was good.  Woman behind counter was extremely unfriendly.  When she brought our meals, served in to-go boxes, she just threw then on the table.   Meals are pricey.   We had a deal chicken and will never return."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I visited there today. I recently moved from the East Coast to Arizona and I have not been impressed with the Soul Food. I was so satisfied with the food at Ezekiels. The Corn Bread and Mac and Cheese was great! The Chicken was fried and seasoned perfectly and their customer service was impeccable. It is family owned and the owners are very down to earth. I will definitely revisit this place. I work in a call center with over 1000 employees and will be spreading the word that we have this place located within 10 mins of the job."}
{"text":"I don't use 5 stars unless it is just over the top in every way. That being said, the food here is very very good. We have been here 4 times now with the family and have tried most everything on the menu between us. All the meats are great. large portions and flavorful. All the sides I have tried, of things I like, were very good. The green beans have a different flavor that will make you never want normal green beans again. I never really liked potato salad but they converted me with theirs. Sweet potato side, is a desert in itself. I am a fan of cornbread and this stuff is great. all they need is really good cream butter and the cornbread could be all you would want to eat.
Nice family restaurant, where they truly want to make sure you are happy."}
{"text":"Some deep South south of PHX! Not much to look at but friendly, homespun folk who cover the basics like GrandMa. Flavorful greens, well spiced fried chicken and fish and cheeeeeeezy Mac-n-Cheese!!! Plenty of Hot sauce to o around. And, YES...I ate all of that on one sitting. Go with an appetite for soulful cooking and welcoming, diverse crowd."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely fabulous!!! The Fried chicken was beyond tasty, it was moist and perfectly seasoned. We tried the greens,  sweet potato's were the best we've ever had, Macaroni & cheese was good, too.  Banana walnut cake, delicious."}
{"text":"Best mom and pop shop! Food is delicious and original. Will pick this place over LoLo's anyday."}
{"text":"The food was great! I ate it so fast had no time to take a picture. They make all of their meat fresh to order. My chicken was hot, fresh, and well seasoned. I wasn't a fan of the ambience, but  the food was great and for  that they get four stars."}
{"text":"Top notch. Everything was spot on, from the greens to the baked mac and cheese, to the perfect catfish and chicken.

Good lord, start with part of your dessert while you're waiting so that you won't get too full to enjoy it. They're ridiculously good

This isn't just \"soul food\"; this is \"food cooked with soul\". I'm quite pleased that the other place I tried to visit was closed. Ezekiel's is a true gem!"}
{"text":"Yum yum...I love the cabbage. Green beans. Chicken and Catfish. Love this home cooked feel you up and have leftovers for lunch the next day. Fresh cooked awesome food. So glad I found them. Ooo yea the cornbread is the best!!"}
{"text":"Good ol southern cuisine. It took a while to prepare so you know it is fresh. Had the fried chicken. It was good, nothing fancy but was cooked through and still juicy."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in town. A great mom and pop shop with friendly service and amazing soul food. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great chicken! And that sweet potato pie is like grandma's pies! The potato salad a little on the sweet side for my taste. But I'm going back to just get the cornbread today lol"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I give this place. 3.5 stars.. as soon as we can find we were greeted by the owner.. he was very nice and informed us about the menu.. we ordered the 1/4 rib dinner combo and 2 OC chicken combo which came with 2 sides.. we ordered the fries, sweet potatoes, Mac and cheese and collard greens.. the sweet potatoes were our favorite.. the fries came out crispy and the Mac and cheese were good.. the collard greens were just okay.. it was my least favorite side which sucked because I like ordering collard greens at restaurants if they have them.. but otherwise you defin get your money's worth.."}
{"text":"Move over Lolo's, Phoenix finally has a good fried chicken restaurant. 
The owner and staff are very friendly.  Everything is homemade, excluding french fries. My order (for three people) consisted of a 12 piece fried chicken with 3 pieces of cornbread and a large serving of collard greens.  The amount of chicken was HUGE and there was plently to take home for left over.  
Bottom line, the fried chicken is fantastic.  
I have no need to go to Lolos anymore; besides the only reason I went there in the first place was for the waffles."}
{"text":"Some of the best soul food this side of the Mississippi. Catfish is best in Ahwatukee"}
{"text":"Happy to find another great place in the East Valley for some comfort food. Had the Frie Chicken Combo w/Mac & Cheese & Greens. Entire meal was on point. Looking forward to returning back for the Catfish, and Ribs, just gotta pace myself...."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is awesome! I also had the fried catfish, Mac and cheese and sweet potatoes. It was a good day because of this meal :) the cornbread is delicious too! There is a wait since all meat is cooked to order, so be patient!  It is worth it!"}
{"text":"Superb fried chicken. They have a way of making it super juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside without it being greasy. The baked mac & cheese is good, too. But don't come here in a hurry. It takes 15-20 minutes to get your food after you place your order. Better to call ahead."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. I can cook soul food, who am I kidding, ANY FOOD very well, but I didn't feel like cooking tonight and yelp had a 10 for 20 deal and they had 4 stars. I go in, it's a small restaurant, decor isn't anything...

My niece warned me prior to ordering not to order the fish, it's battered like a fish stick so I stayed away from that. I ordered for me my son and my niece, with my second order I didn't want all dark meat so I order a breast instead of the thigh. When we got our orders, he mixed up which meal I wanted the change made to. That's ok, it happens- he then proceeded with, \"that's not what you said you wanted\". That to me was rude, I had my niece and son there to verify, then he told me after waiting 25 mins that it would be another 15 mins to fix it. My son is seven, that's not going to work. So I looked at the food, he placed greens in one plate with chicken and cabbage in another plate with the chicken. I'm not sure if he was trying to save money on plates and dishes but then our chicken was soggy by the time we got home...womp womp womp. And the sweet tea, it has to be a powdery drink mix... 

Overall, the food was edible but nothing spectacular and the customer service was subpar. I will not drive that way for soul food again."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the lack of plush velvet chairs or mood lighting. This place is about the food! As a true southern Texas gal, I can appreciate the cooking! The chicken was divine! It wasn't dry or overcooked! The coleslaw and green beans were fantastic! The sweet cornbread was like my grandma used to make! Even the sweet tea brought memories of home! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can literally eat their sweet potatoes with marshmallows every single day for the rest of my life. Definitely on the sweeter side but works perfectly for me. Plus they have the chicken that Definitely brings the salt out. They take about 20 min to cook so I always call ahead so it's ready when I get there ! I really love this place. WAY WAY WAY better then lolos dry chicken."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Thanks for the familial dining in experience and awesome hospitality. I will be back."}
{"text":"I tried out the fried chicken and sides to go.  
Sides:  
Coleslaw was good but it was a bit too sweet for my taste, I preferred it to be more tangy. 
Collard greens:  It was definitely cooked with something smoked, you can taste that---ham hock maybe.  But it was also a tinge sweet.  Never had greens sweet before. Not bad.
Mashed potatoes & Gravy:  Potatoes were real and great--good buttery flavor.  You don't need gravy for it, but together it was really good. 
Cornbread: On point.  Moist, good texture and perfect sweetness.  Oddly enough, the coleslaw was sweeter than the cornbread.  
Mac & Cheese:  It was okay.  I preferred a little something crunchy just for texture.  

Chicken:  
My review of the chicken might have been better if I ate there.  Since I took it to go, the breading may have lost a little crispiness.  It was definitely good.  The skin was crispy, good seasoning and the meat was moist.  

Great flavor for all items and definitely a place to try out."}
{"text":"Above average fried chicken and ribs delivered right to my office. I liked the potato salad and the mac n' cheese but I think everything would have been much better if eaten at the restaurant. 30-min in a foam box doesn't do this type of food any favors."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular.  It's as family owned and operated as you get.  They take pride in their food and they love compliments.  To me, this is comfort food.  The sweet potatoes and collard greens are worth a try.  The cakes are addicting... the chicken... well, don't get me started on the chicken, just look at the stars I rated them."}
{"text":"Had heard about this place thru the grapevine and decided to try it out.  All I can say is Yummmmmm!  Got there right at noon on a Friday.  One other couple was there.  You order at the counter, which we did, then sat and waited.  It was a bit of a wait, but not bad.  By the time our food came out the place was packed.  I had the fried chicken and honestly think it was the best I've ever had.  I also enjoyed the mac and cheese.  My Mom had the shrimp and collard greens which she really enjoyed.  We both said we would order it again.  Our only request is that they up their game on the desserts.  When you are eating Soul food you need to have cobbler!"}
{"text":"RUN!! Do NOT walk... to this restaurant! Wow! Home cooking at it's best! I love when people really know how to perfect the basics of home cooking. Everything is hot and fresh. The chicken is moist and crunchy. The Mac and cheese is my Maryland Mac and cheese. Sweet potatoes are SWEET. 
And I'm stuffed. It was worth the 40 minute drive. No frills, just good food."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Ezikels several times and have never been disappointed! Mac and Cheese is the best around, and I take my Mac and Cheese seriously. 

The owners are super sweet and make it a point to spark up interesting conversations. The space is small, yet very clean. 

I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for the best fried chicken in town."}
{"text":"My husband is from Louisiana and we've wanted to try this place.  We had the fried chicken and ribs, both great!  For sides we tried the greens, sweet potatoes, Mac n cheese and macaroni salad.  My husband loved the greens, I loved the sweet potatoes.  

The family that owns it are so nice and helpful, my daughter thought the woman at the front was great.  It took a while to get the food.   You can order ahead or they do local delivery.  Like the other reviews said, it is not fancy, just down home cooking.   

Can't wait to try the desert, people came in just for the banana cake and the triple chocolate cake."}
{"text":"It smelled awesome walking in, so we were really optimistic at the start of our dining experience.  The food was very disappointing.  The catfish was the toughest fish I have ever tried to eat.  The thinner parts of the it were so hard I could not eat at all.  The fried chicken was super dry.  I dont know why they served it to us because it was visibly overcooked.  The marshmallows that I'm assuming were meant for the sweet potatoes were melted on the bun for my catfish sandwich.  The gentleman behind the counter was friendly but nothing was brought to our table.  Which seemed a little strange considering I need to use a cane to walk and I was there with an elderly parent- so to have us keep getting up to come to the counter to get the sodas he forgot to give us, then the chicken which came out later, then sauces.  We took our leftovers with us (which there were a lot of) but we just threw it away somewhere else because we were embarassed that none of us liked it and felt bad throwing it all away in front of them.  Seeing all the good reviews on here I might go try it again.  I really like to support locally owned business.  But it was really bad food even though we wanted to like it."}
{"text":"I am so upset. With all the reviews I thought it would be good, but it's horrible! First off the lady at the counter had no customer service skills but then again no one in Phoenix does! On to the food: I got the catfish dinner, as sides I got mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes. I also added a side of mac n cheese and a crab cake. The crab cake had way to much salt. The mac n cheese had way to much pepper. The greens were sweet and I don't like sweet collard greens but if you add hot sauce it's not that bad. The sweet potatoes are NOTHING like the pictures I see with the marshmallows baked with it. They were canned and they added spices...but they were the best thing on the whole order. I did have corn bread an I will admit that was good. Lastly the catfish.... OMG disgusting!!!! It taste like rubber or like the fish had gone bad but they fried it anywhere. Catfish should flake and be very tender when chewing there's it was like steak. There was NO soul in this soul food. Please don't waste your money. I spent almost $23"}
{"text":"Ya know these people are a real nice family from PA. They apparently owned this restaurant there for 30+ years before moving here.

Is it the best soul food? No. However I'd definitely come back at some point. Here are the pros and cons

Pros:

Mac and cheese
Fried Chicken (overall good but needs some seasoning..kinda bland)
The folks (just nice people)
Sweet Potato Pie


The cons:

The place is filthy. Cobwebs etc all over, dirty floors and tables

Lack of spice in chicken

Catfish was real plain and had no real flavor either

Pricey. $25 for an 8 piece with a couple sides


This is a good option if you are in this part of town and need soul food and don't want to drive all the way to Lo Lo's. I have to give Lolo the edge in the flavor dept however. 

If these guys would add a tiny bit of Cayenne and garlic and maybe a little salt to their batter it would be the best in town."}
{"text":"Wow! Everything that I have head about Ezekiel's is true. The Chicken is so good! Crisp crust with moist tender meat. I ordered sides of mac&cheese and greens. Those were really tasty. The cornbread was old fashion good. Everything was really good. The chicken is made to order. It took about a 15 minutes to get my order. It's worth the wait. They also take call in orders and online. The menu has so many items. I'm sure everyone can find something they like. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered through a food delivery service.  Food took  almost an hour and a half.  I called to find out what was taking so long and they said they gave my food to someone else and said they were making another one.  I then get the food and I have no sauce, no silverware, nothing.  Drive to the restaurant and they act like it is my fault for not requesting the silverware and napkins.  What?  Then the fish was soggy on top of it all. They took no accountability for their mess up and acted like it was my fault.  Will not be returning EVER."}
{"text":"Wow. Ezekiel's really blew me away! Being a transplant from the east coast can be rough especially since I'm really not into Mexican cuisine, that's why I was so taken with this place. It was cozy and clean, the food was cooked to order and to perfection and tasted like it was whipped up by the lady from church who you KNOW can throw down at any cookout. Ezekiel's is definitely a hidden gem in Ahwatukee, it's like a secret weapon or something lol plus the staff was awesome too, they knew every person that came in after us personally. Hopefully someday they'll know my name too because I will DEFINITELY be a regular!"}
{"text":"Best grub I've had in a long time. Chicken breast was juicy, sweet potatoes on point, corn bread and Mac n cheese was awesome and their banana walnut cake was amazing..amazing"}
{"text":"PROS
8PC fried chicken! Crispy and hot! Great deal for all the chicken, half thighs, other half legs and 1 wing, love the dark meat, it's my fave
Sweet potatoes were delish and like candy!
Place was pretty full for a weeknight dinner, seems to have consistent, loyal customers
My friend loved his butterfly shrimp

CONS
The owner was pretty unorganized when taking orders
The AC was barely on and fans were not that helpful

Average mac and cheese...I like the more melty kind and there were just chunks of cheese mixed it"}
{"text":"Okay this review is overdue...but I wanted to show Ezekiel's some love. Those who've read my other reviews know that I'm a sucker for soul food and every so often...I must have some YARD BIRD in my life!! I was in Arizona for a friend's retirement...I flew into Phoenix but stayed in Tuscon (yes...I did....it was cheaper...significantly cheaper).  On my departure date...I checked out of the hotel at 12 and my flight leaving PHX was not until later. It's less than a 2hour drive from Tucson to Phoenix....so I would have some time to kill...I immediately thought of finding some fried chicken for lunch! So, I Yelped my way to Ezekiel's. It's a small mom-n-pop joint close to I-10.  I walked in....it was empty. Two gentlemen were sitting and talking (not eating)....I got the impression one (if not both) was affiliated with the restaurant in some professional way. There was a young lady behind the counter....totally immersed in her iPhone. I ordered a 2 piece fried chicken meal (added a 3rd piece...because...well..I'm greedy) with collard greens, potato salad and corn bread. This is where Ezekiel's lost a star from me...I sat at a nearby table and waited.....and waited....and waited. While I waited several folks came in and picked up their call-in orders (I assume). The young lady served them their to-go packages and went back to her iPhone business. The two gentlemen remained immersed in their private conversation. I was getting a little perturbed but honestly...I had plenty of time to kill so I continued to wait. Ultimately though (after 14 minutes), when my food finally came out...it was damn good. I'm a self-proclaimed Yard Bird aficionado so I am qualified to say that Ezekiel's fried chicken is delicious!! The greens were just okay (not seasoned enough for my liking) but the potato salad and cornbread were both good as well. The chicken was piping hot too. So I assumed it was fresh out the grease which could have attributed to the delay. I'm not gonna say it was worth the LONG wait...but it was indeed some yummy chicken. 

PROS:
Delicious fried chicken!!

CONS: 
The wait was brutal. THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!!!!! I felt abandoned. Lol. 

RECOMMENDATION:
Yes! Delicious Fried Chicken. 

SIDE NOTE:
Arizona is hot as hell.....I mean....literally........Arizona is as HOT AS THE DEVIL'S PRIMARY RESIDENCE!! Don't give me that \"it's a dry heat\" crap either. I live in South Texas.....I know hot weather. The sun is aimed directly at the state of Arizona.....HOT!!!!"}
{"text":"I would love to try something else but I keep coming back for the fried Chicken. My daughter is a picky eater and says the corn bread is out of this world"}
{"text":"I just finished an amazing lunch here. This was my first time here and it was a little hard to find so I'll let you know it's half-way between Taco Bell and Chuck E. Cheese, along the south edge of the mall it's in.

I had the Fried Chicken Dinner with cornbread, cole slaw and sweet potatoes. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked, crispy outside and so juicy inside. The owners' experience shows in how well everything was prepared and in the way the flavors worked so well together. Even the hot sauce was a perfect compliment to the flavor of the chicken. The portion sizes were generous too. Laurita and Brad were very pleasant to talk with as I waited for my dinner to be cooked to order. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Really delish food, fresh, and friendly service. Fried chicken was amazing, really good corn bread."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my boyfriend and I by an acquaintance of ours. We were looking for something a little different than usual when we stopped by this place. As it turns out, it's a small little restaurant on Warner in the plaza by Basha's, Chuck E. Cheese's, and many other stores. It was a little tricky trying to find the place but we found it okay.

The ambiance has that family owned feel so it wasn't terribly too shocking that it's family run!
 
My boyfriend ordered fried chicken lunch with collard greens, cornbread, and had the Cherry Kool-Aid. I had ordered the tilapia lunch with baked macaroni & cheese, cornbread, and had a soda. The gentleman behind the counter gave us an almost exact time (even though it seemed he was doing everything himself).

Once the food came out, my boyfriend and I dug in! The tilapia tasted extremely fresh! It tasted as though they just caught it this morning! The macaroni & cheese actually tasted like macaroni & cheese! The cornbread was as sweet and wonderful as expected!

I took a bite of my boyfriend's chicken just to try how his chicken was - and it was perfectly crisp, seasoned, and delicious! The collard greens were also really delicious!

Originally, we were planning to purchase & eat some dessert but by the time we were done (and we literally ate everything on our plates), we just couldn't eat any more.

However, this restaurant isn't without its criticisms. The Cherry Kool-Aid was way too sweet! Normally, I could handle a lot of sweetened drinks but with this Kool-Aid, it's just way too sweet! I don't know how my boyfriend could handle it since he doesn't really like sweets that much himself. While both the macaroni & cheese and collard greens were extremely delicious, it was still a bit bland. However, it's nothing a little extra salt and pepper couldn't fix.

Now the question remains: would we return to Ezekiel's Restaurant? Of course we would! Despite the minor complaints we share, we can definitely see ourselves become regulars here!"}
{"text":"Just got done eating here and The food was amazing the best friend chicken I've ever had. The service was also outstanding! The people that own this place really makes you feel comfortable and welcome.  I would recommend This restaurant to everybody I know."}
{"text":"My wife seen this place on pbs Arizona eats and Id have to say it's some of the best fried chicken I've ever ate. Not greasy and completely delicious, the skin is like candy, I can't wait to try the fish and the ribs. Service was amazing, very friendly good people thank you for making our community better."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Ahwatukee? How about best fried chicken west of the Mississippi River! Lunch was fabulous! Fried chicken, cole slaw, perfect. Next \"don't feel like cooking \" evening I'll be getting a whole bucket!!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I have had in Arizona ! I know I said the same thing in the past about lolos chicken, but wow this place blows lolos out of the water and then some! Since they have gone down greatly in quality, I decided to venture into new fried chicken territory and I am so glad I did!

The chicken is nice and crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside and not greasy at all! The cornbread is yummy and the sweet potatoes are delish! Give them a try, I ordered through UberEATS and can't wait to have them again, when it's been a respectable amount of time between fried chicken feasts!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is just fantastic and the service and kindness of the the owner is unmatched."}
{"text":"OMG get a cake...get the cakes...get the cake. SO GOOD! This food fills you up and makes you feel comforted. Le sigh. 

I am full, and happy. Food make with love : )"}
{"text":"Wow real down home soul food in AZ and so super friendly! If you love soul food you will love this place! Not fancy by any means but super good! Try it you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This little place is a hidden gem. Don't pass it up - terrific food, friendly people, and did I mention terrific food? We had ribs and fried chicken and several side dishes. The ribs were tender and meaty with a delectable bbq sauce. The chicken was lightly battered, peppery, hot and delicious. Sides - collard greens to beat all, fried cabbage, sweet potatoes that were sweeeeet and green beans that were good too. The cornbread was a bit sweet, but dry. It could use a little butter and honey I think. But hey Ezekiel's I will be back again and again and again. Yum."}
{"text":"Sooo good!  I had the 2 piece white fried chicken and my husband had the dark meat. It was cooked perfectly and just delicious. I had the mac and cheese and sweet potatoes and my husband had the green beans and french fries. I think the mac and cheese was almost as good as mine! The prices were very good and the owners were very nice, and very personable. We chatted through our meal as though we were old friends. Very much looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"The most satisfying soul food, cooked and served by some of the most gracious, warmest people around these parts.  

This is the nostalgic 'back home' that we all secretly long to go to, even if it's just a dinky little soul food restaurant tucked into a strip mall in Ahwatukee.

Fried chicken, catfish, BBQ, buttered corn, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, corn bread, candied sweet potatoes, Kool-Aid, lemonaid...all this deliciousness awaits you here."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying soul food and I have to admit that it was very good. The store is owned/operated by a married couple who are super funny and friendly. The menus have lots of choices and combos to choose from at reasonable prices. I ordered a 2 pieces of dark meat chicken (leg & breast). It was super tender and juicy. I don't remember the last time I had fried chicken this good. My meal also comes with corn bread and two sides and I choose sweet potatoes and claw. They both both equally delicious. The corn bread was soft , fluffy and buttery. My friends and I enjoyed our meals. We had good laughs with the regulars as well as the owner. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves soul food."}
