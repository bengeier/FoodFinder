{"text":"This place is awesome! Nice and cosy inside with friendly wait staff. Also the beer selection is good :D"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! Awesome music! Awesome Staff, AWESOME Management!

Great spot for a\"let loose friday\" when you just wanna dance it out! The cocktails are fantastic, I especially love that they always remember my drink!
Bouncer Matt, super nice guy, always super hospitable and great whenever I go there. I am not usually one to go to the same place twice but it sure is just one of those spots that keep you coming back. The managers Kyle & Nikki always go out of their way to say hello to me when they see me as well as servers/bartenders. Never had any issues here, and after going here many many Thursdays through Saturdays, it is clear that the people who end up having issues are not the nicest to begin with (seen it with my own eyes).  Just wish there weren't so many spoiled brats there - they kill the vibe!

{"text":"A few of my friends went here because CC Lounge was full, and I came to join them. There were a few people waiting in front of me, and the bouncers said it was at full capacity. I was waiting in line for about 10 minutes and noticed a bunch of people leave and texted one of my friends. She said it was empty and came to see if I could go inside. The bouncers said I had to wait for people to leave... which is fine. I waited for another 10 minutes, but noticed a bunch of other people leave...so I asked if they were going to let anyone else in, since it was almost last call, and if they weren't going to, my friends and I would just go somewhere else... rather than waiting in line if I wasn't going to get in. The one bouncer responded, \"If you're not happy leave\"... and I said I was sorry if I offended them but I was just wondering. They then let the people in front of me in (even though no one left at that time), and when they got to me they said, \"I'm sorry I think you're a little too drunk, I think you need to go home.\" I told them I was sorry if I offended them in anyway, and they said, \"Well if you wanted inside you maybe shouldn't have said anything.\"
I'm a server and understand there are certain rules you have to follow... I totally get it. But that wasn't the problem here. Your bouncers need to get off their high horse. I can't say anything for the rest of the staff since I didn't even get inside... but I think the limited power they have has gone to their head a little bit too much.
They ended up letting everyone else in except me... my friends and I ended up going back to CC Lounge which was still packed. We'll definetly remember to pass on this place next time.

*Also, I wrote this review while I was \"a little too drunk\" to get into the bar."}
{"text":"This WAS my go-to spot for drinks. I celebrated my birthday, my husband's birthday, among many other events here, so we decided to come for new years eve since we live in the area. 

Everything was great up until about 1:30am when I believe the staff forgot that they were at work and turned the place into a club you'd find in Cancun. While waiting to close up our tabs (which mind you I had to go to the back of the bar myself to get my card before someone came to help me), we were caught in the crossfire TWICE of a waitress spraying her coworkers with sprite from the bar. Tried to get out of the way but there's only so much you can do when a drunk waitress is haphazardly spraying soda all over the place. Needless to say, we were soaked. If I wanted a wild and crazy new years, I would've gone to Crocodile Rock. Yes, I just compared this place to Crocodile Rock. 

DW - you were once classy. but after this, definitely not. I really hope you clean up your act. Or at least pay my dry cleaning bill."}
{"text":"I walked in and the place seemed nice enough. Nobody greeted me or even acknowledged me which set the tone for an awkward experience. I found a spot to meet my date but still couldn't shake that unwelcoming feeling. Someone came to take my order but was less than enthused to do so. The only redeeming factor was the kind bartender who tried to save the experience. He saved it enough for us to order a few more drinks but not enough to round out the experience with food. Seemed like a nice enough place, but in a city with so many good offerings, I'd suggest taking your money somewhere else. Cocktails were good."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would, I have never experienced such rude and unprofessional service at a bar until coming here. 
I came here last Friday night with friends and was rudely greeted by the bouncer who made it sound mandatory to check our coats which it wasn't. We made our way in to a table and found our server was less than polite and seemed bothered that we didn't want to put a credit card down to start a tab. One of our drinks was incorrectly ordered by accident so my friend went to let the server know to change it (before it was being made) and she gave my friend so much attitude for this, going so far as to yell at the bartender that she (my friend) \"messed up.\"
We eventually got our cocktails (which weren't well made) and upon leaving asked to speak to the manager to let them know of this experience. To our surprise he went on and defended the server pretty much making it a point to my friend that she was in the wrong and couldn't even acknowledge or offer a simple apology for the terrible service we received. He even had the nerve to ask my friends which part of their home country they were from, as if that is at all relevant?
Needless to say it's no surprise the service staff here act the way they do when their manager sets an example of treating customers with such disrespect and arrogance. I've been here on multiple occasions but after this will not be going back.

Note to management: take a refresher in customer service, clearly it's not just my review on here that points to how terribly you treat customers."}
{"text":"my girlfriend and i were on our way to bier markt and got invited in for a drink.  we were expecting the foundation room (that's what this place was called previously) crowd but instead were pleasantly surprised by a beautiful little speakeasy type place.  we tried the 'hot date', 'poire sauvage' and 'judy blue eyes' and were impressed by all 3 cocktails.  in addition to this, because they had just opened, we were given complimentary appies - the seasonal trout terrine and the bison sliders.  both were delicious. the bartenders knew their drinks and the music added the perfect vibe.  if you're in the neighbourhood, check it out!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would.  This place ruined my night.  The management was completely unreasonable and unprofessional.  The bouncer made my party wait outside for hours!! He was so pretentious. I was disgusted by the first impression. If you have a large group dont bother coming here because they don't care for your business. There are tons of bars in this city,  I will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"2 words: bacon popcorn. 

That stuff is the BOMB. To be honest, I come here almost primarily for the bacon popcorn. 

But the excellently crafted cocktails and the cozy lounge-like atmosphere sure doesn't hurt either. 

I've had several things from the menu (charcuterie, sliders, fish cake) and enjoyed them all. No complaints whatsoever. 

Also definitely order a Manhattan or negroni while you're here, too!"}
{"text":"An excellent spot for drinks. The cocktails were impressive and strong. The atmosphere and service can't be beat. It would be nice if it was busier, but an excellent place to start or spend your night."}
{"text":"Visited on Friday during happy hour, but was disappointed to learn that the kitchen was out of service due to an incident earlier in the week. 

It was another blow to learn that happy hour only applied to cocktails, and not wine or beer. 

We stayed for one cocktail because the ambiance was perfect!

I look forward to going back when the kitchen is back in service and things are in full swing."}
{"text":"I held a surprise birthday party here recently and we had the most amazing time!! The space was perfect and the drinks and music were absolutely amazing. Nikki and Kyle were extremely attentive and accommodating and the event went off perfectly.

We had about 35 people show up and everyone got in without any issues. Our server (Alex) was amazing. She somehow was able to track all of our drink orders and kept the drinks flowing for us the entire night. We reserved the library section at the back of the bar so had plenty of space to ourselves for the entire evening. I will definitely be coming back here for the amazing food, drinks and service!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for drinks. Awesome new spot downtown, well done. The decor is really warm and loungy, music was a bit much for a Tuesday but still good. I had the Old Fachist cocktail, recommended by our server Aofa(?) and it was stellar.
This is definitely a place I'd go to again...
The service was great and we were even brought a complimentary appetizer which was also lovely. If you want to sit quietly and enjoy your date with a well made cocktail, this is a place you should check out."}
{"text":"Just an update to my previous review. So I've been a regular for a long time (was even invited to the first regulars party back in May 2015). I will say the music and drinks are still great, but you should know that apparently the policy has changed to no one is allowed in past 1am (referencing a specific Friday night)- despite the bar being 70%-ish capacity.

A couple of other friends have found similar treatment during earlier hours of the night. Again, still love the music and the drinks- but I'm more likely to recommend another bar for a Friday or Saturday night out in the area."}
{"text":"I organized a surprise 30th birthday at DW Alexander last Saturday and from beginning to end, it was an incredible experience.  I was a bit weary at first after reading some of these negative reviews, which I found to be all completely inaccurate.  The key with making reservations is giving accurate numbers and details.  The establishment can't be blamed if your entire party doesn't get in, if you don't advise them of the correct number of people.

Kyle (the General Manager) was an absolute pleasure to work with.  He was extremely professional and very responsive to my questions.  He thoroughly explained all of the logistics of the night and ensured all of my guests got in without any issues.  The entire night was seamless thanks to him and the great staff there.  He also went out of his way to get me paper plates for the birthday cake as there was a large group of us (50+) which I thought was a nice gesture.

I would absolutely recommend this place as a venue for hosting any party.  The music is incredible - old school hip hop, the decor is beautiful, service at the bar was fast, our bottle service waitress was extremely attentive and finally the door man was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Very knowledgeable about ol'timey drinks and will even custom make you a drink by naming a single ingredient or what you prefer. Excellent service who gave us a free whisky cocktail shot and white wine pairing for our nicely plated cheese board and olives in a glass. I'll be back again to try more of their drink and food menu."}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviews! I wish I can give 0 stars. Had my birthday there and the bartender was an A$$h01e. Waiting 45 mins for a drink. We had a tab running, was the first few people at the bar. Severed everyone and just ignored us. The manager got him to apologize but he was just made excuse. He should be fired. I have been in management for 15 years and I would never keep someone like that in my team. Obviously DW has a very low expectations for service. 

Music is great but service is shit!"}
{"text":"was here two days in a row, by fluke. 

the Friday was to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and the Saturday was because we were walking by and couldn't think of anywhere else to go.

it's on the higher end of pricing and the service was mediocre. I was upset that I told the bar tender it was my BF's birthday and to not let him pay but she still insisted on it. 

the Friday was more live than the Saturday and the ambiance reflected that. 

we had louder more club like feel to the place Friday vs Saturday. we asked the DJ to turn up the music a few times on Saturday with no luck so we left around 1. 

nice place, clean."}
{"text":"This place does not deserve even 1 star. DO NOT GO HERE! This is the worst customer service I have ever received. The staff was horrible, unprofessional and disrespectful. Kyle and Nikki were the most useless management I have ever dealt with. They were rude and do not know the meaning of customer service. There bouncer was even worse. He would not let half of my party in even though we had a booth and bottle service. He swore at my guests and lied to the management and said we swore at him. I HAVE A RECORDING WITH THE BOUNCER SWEARING AND THREATENING MY GUESTS!!! What type of business is this. Do not waste your time or money here. This place ruined my night and my party. Worst place ever! I want an apology from the management and bouncer. They did not even try to fix things and make my night better. On top of that they charged me for things I did not want. These people are crooks. I want my money back!!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"This place deserves zero stars. The words \"customer service\" mean absolutely nothing to them. The staff is completely unprofessional - the manager, Kyle and his bouncers have no respect for their customers. The staff is compromised of false promises. Half of our party was denied entry (even after purchasing bottles), they messed up on bills, had rude servers, etc. Our entire party was unhappy and there was nothing the staff did to make it better. There are many places in Toronto that are way better for a night out and they treat you right. I would NOT recommend to host anything at this place! Probably one of the worst experiences in Toronto we've had! Congrats DW Alexander for being a candidate for Toronto's worst lounge!"}
{"text":"D.W. Alexander is a quaint and cozy restaurant with a unique vibe. 

Food was fantastic! we had the charcuterie board - salami was delish! cheese board - very sparse portions but decent, duck sliders - probably my favourite dish!, mushroom slider - good but nothing special, salmon tartar - delish, fish cake - i only had a few bites but my bf enjoyed it, taco - yummy! one of my favourite dishes as well. The cocktails were great, I had about 3 Judy Blue Eyes

Service was STELLAR, our server (wish I remembered her name, she had curly hair) was amazing. The food was served incredibly quickly, she checked on us from time to time and when we inquired about the dessert, the chef himself came to tell us about his creation. It was awesome for him to do that!!! 

All in all a great experience and we'll certainly visit again!"}
{"text":"'Twas a perfect place to begin a memorable night out with an old friend.

Great addition to this area. Mahogany office/library speakeasy feel. Grab a cocktail or something straight up. Begin your illicit conversations."}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders who made a whiskey sour from scratch! I'm talking with an egg! Overall, great spot to grab a drink and hang with friends. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Thur May 25 for a private party. 
Our group had about 20 people and the back section of the bar was reserved for us. This is a great place to hold a birthday party or private event. There was no DJ or loud music on a Thur night which is what we were looking for. 

Pros
Interesting decor and atmosphere, great job of creating that speakeasy atmosphere. I have been to this place when it was Foundation Room a long time ago. 
Amazing food tried a few of their appetizers. 
Amazing bartender and drinks, some of which are very unique. I had the gingerale, and was pleasantly surprised 

Cons
They had an unattended coat check rack all the way near the front of the bar, which is generally not good. Either have it staffed or just keep hooks on the wall. 
Only had Beck's non-acloholic beer, when there are several other better options available. Bud Prohibition is becoming very popular. 

Protip - Ask for the Wifi code."}
{"text":"A nice classy dim lit place, that has quiet a nice 30ish crowd,  however drinks are like approx $8 each."}
{"text":"This is my go-to happy hour spot for a post-work drink in the financial district.

The cocktails are very well done and the dimly lit interior is just right. Happy hour means: $8 cocktails, $7 wine, or $6 beer. They make a serious Manhattan (goes for $14 during non-happy hours).

Since my last visit to DW, the service has improved 110%, hence my updated review. Staff are not pretentious and service is efficient. During my first visit, our food order never arrived but I have summed this up to a one-time error.

Drinks come with a free serving of extra buttery and bacon-topped popcorn. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Just was reviewing my receipts from the night of my birthday drinks at DW Alexander and noticed that they were adding 18% tip automatically to the bill without informing me.    Not cool.  I paid the guy $80 on a bill that was $64.49.  Little did I know that the actual tab was $52.70 and they added a $9.49 tip (18%) automatically.   

And they wonder why it's not busy in there?  You pull BS like this and you will end up having fewer and fewer fans."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and music here with some fancy bar drinks and cocktail options. Easy vibe for those just want to sit or stand and relax, but also offers a nice dance space for those in the mood. Appeals to a 30-something crowd and hipsters..."}
{"text":"The place is awesome, bartenders are amazing. Highly recommended. My goto spot for sure. Nikki is the sweetest person in the whole widest world! I love her (she's the manager)"}
{"text":"Very busy. Small place and cozy place. Very sexy crowd. Everyone looks beautiful, upscale, mature and professional. The DJ did a good job mixing old school music. It was something for everyone.  The bartenders did amazing job. They were quick and knew what they were doing."}
{"text":"This is a great little place. I've never left the house intending to visit this place but I've ended up here a few time nonetheless. It's very charming and all the staff are very nice. It just wish there was more seating space. The crowd can vary from night-to-night. I think this is mostly because of how small the place is. If a group of friends decide to come here then they will constitute a big part of the crowd!"}
{"text":"A social event took  me to this fine venue the other evening. It was a repetition of several years back minus the mockery from another UBC alumnus.

What I enjoyed the most was the friendly exchange with the bartender who mentioned the wines. And to my delight, my favourite Trapiche was served.

The venue itself has not changed layout. 

Seven years later, this social event was easier to manage."}
{"text":"Went out with a group of guys to this place and it was awesome!

We arrived around 11 and there was no line-up but the place was buzzing inside. Lot's of cool people and the music was awesome.

The choice of only having Meridian on tap was interesting but I liked it. Hope to come back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Was there last night (Saturday) arrived at about 10:30pm, no line.
Pros: 
-bouncers were super nice and had no problems on the way in, even offered a hand so we wouldn't trip on the step up over the door jam. On the way out they photo bombed a photo and then joked with us until out uber arrived.
-the music- the DJ played all the great stuff from 90s and 00s, with some current stuff mixed in too. It was impossible not to get up and dance or singalong the whole time. It was a bit loud though so carrying any kind of conversation is nearly impossible
-atmosphere/decor - I really like the whole vibe and that it wasn't a massive space. It felt intimate but you still had your space
Cons:
-service is a tad slow and one of the two waitresses serving us never brought two drinks but we were still charged for them 
-the cocktails weren't my favourite. They were $13 each and I ordered a whiskey sour and an amaretto sour and both were off in the flavour balances 

That said I would still come back. Probably not great for a date or if you wanna have conversations but if you have a group of 4-6 then this is a good option."}
{"text":"We went there for happy hour,  which last until 8pm.  Drinks were great. Small plates were great, more like tapas. The price for the small plates were $5.00 each.   Great value for the price.  We sat at the bar.  Bartender was fabulous.   Great value."}
{"text":"D.W. Alexander is a small bar with an intimate feel and a slightly speak easy vibe. I think if you want to be able to hear your date and enjoy a nice drink, this is a good place to come. I can't picture it being some crazy fun night out type of joint, but who knows. On St. Patty's it certainly had a line up."}
{"text":"The old fashioned and old facist are both delicious cocktails.  The complementary bacon popcorn is a nice touch ! 

Duck sliders are delish. 

 Go for happy hour otherwise the cocktails are very expensive. 

Will return for that popcorn!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our way to dinner.  You go down a set of stairs to reach it.  This is a nice cool place in hot weather.  They have a DJ in the evening.  It feels like a men's club with wood and leather furnishings.  They have done a nice job here.

They have a nice set of cocktails and a nicer set of spirits.  We liked the menu and the prices were fair.  The drinks were well done.  The staff is very friendly and we were rewarded with a nice crackers and cheese board.

This is a very nice place to stop in for a drink.  It is geared for a crowd a bit younger than us, but the entire staff could not have been nice.  This is a place I will stop in again.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"great drinks, cool laid back vibe, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for drinks - cozy, warm ambiance, friendly staff, complimentary popcorn.. Love it!"}
{"text":"I was invited to the prelaunch of Toronto's newest drinkery, D.W. Alexander (Church/Front), this evening ... the official open is next Thursday.

With 20 years in the hospitality business, Jamil Kamal, Owner, D.W. Alexander pays homage to the venue's history, naming it after its original tenant, D.W. Alexander, the largest sole-leather trader in Western Canada who launched his leather business back in 1872.

The perfect destination for after work drinks, offering only premium alcohol, custom cocktails and specializing in rye-based drinks, the selection was created by mixologist Aaron Beaudouin, who has previously consulted for Toronto hot spots such as Rock Lobster, Goods & Provisions, e11even Restaurant and L'Unita. D.W. Alexander will also offer a fresh update on the typical bar snack menu using all local Canadian-made ingredients, created by Sean Simons, Executive Chef, Goods & Provisions, who has also worked for well-known dining destinations including The Comrade, Morton's The Steakhouse and Meating.

The D.W. Alexander space received a stylish, old-meets-new update by Allen Chan, Co-Founder, Design Agency with construction by Box General Contracting to incorporate the heritage of its location in the basement space of a rare 19th century warehouse, while incorporating modern design elements. D.W. Alexander features a vibrant chartreuse tile wall in the main entrance by Ciot, with Douglas fir reclaimed wood from Winfields Farm, birthplace of the famous racing champion Northern Dancer, featured in the restrooms. Other key design elements include benches with a Paul Smith printed tartan fabric by Manharam Fabric, intimate custom-lighting by Milke Bau Lighting Design and a library complete with walnut bookshelves filled with an eccentric mix of ancient books and curio inspired by the city, its history and the building. To further celebrate Canadian style, door staff will keep warm with Nobis jackets.

They were serving their three signature drinks tonight ... the Avro Arrow, the Sloe Gin and an Old-Fashioned.  I tried them all and liked the Sloe Gin the best.

Some appies were served.  Gord said the Bison Sloppy Joe was okay.  The Potato Fritters were yummy!  Gord like the Arctic Char but not the biscuit

There was quite the crowd and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.

This would be a cool spot to stop in for a drink (or two) in a historic building.  My only issue is that the washrooms aren't marked and the women's washroom was really dark."}
{"text":"Bouncer was very unreasonable. He had insisted people were drunk and rejected entrance while we were not. Not sure what's the business strategy here but overall a 0 star experience."}
{"text":"We passed by this place on an early evening on St. Patrick's day - My girlfriend had been here before, so we decided to stay. We were trying to avoid the St. Pattys crowd. Even though it was quite at the time we had done 9pm ish. I can tell this place can be enjoyable for groups of friends intimate enough for a date as well. It's casual with a hint up formal flair. I got a very 1800's kind of décor vibe. They serve food here and I am sure it tastes as good as it smelt amazing; although, I came here only for drinks. The bathrooms were clean and had a rustic fell that went along with the warehouse underground bar.

I had the Yoga Mat and my girlfriend as the Old Fascist. Both drinks where made well and absolutely delicious. The gin drink was so yum! - I don't know why I love gin so much. I feel I might have the soul of a 65 year old women lol."}
{"text":"My younger years, this was Foundation Room and it was always a great choice because of intimacy. Fastforward to it's current incarnation as D.W Alexander, and it's still providing the same benefit of intimacy. It's a great space, that's been very well maintained over the years, and a great fully stocked bar. 

Looking at this place now, I'm thinking this is perfect for smaller events."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 0 stars for the absolutely disgusting experience I had here. My friend made a reservation for her boyfriends surprise birthday over a week in advance and was not even allowed in upon arrival. Several guests were turned away despite having a reservation they kept telling us no one was allowed in. 

The manager was incredibly rude and disrespectful and called myself and friends \"psychos\" and \"rude\" multiple times despite us simply trying to explain our situation. We ended up having to move the group to a pub around the corner so we could still surprise my friend's boyfriend after they were not allowed into the bar. Even when we arrived the table was not ready at the time of the reservation and the staff were completely disorganized and rude. The bouncer wouldn't even get off his 5 minute long personal phone call to explain why people could not get into the club and told me if I came upstairs again to speak to him I would have to leave. 

I've worked as a server and bartender for several years and if I ever gave a patron the same attitude I experienced I would be fired on the spot. This place should be shut down, I can't believe it is still in business."}
{"text":"Great place to have a party or to just hang out in the back couches with friends. The drinks are expensive but they make them really well . The staff is friendly and fast . I have been here several times and always a great time . Music ranges from top 40s to old school hip hop . The bathrooms and the remaining place is clean and well maintained ."}
{"text":"Do you like old timey cocktails and bacon popcorn?  Then this is the place for you.  We ordered a gin fizz and a hot date. Both really good.  The servers were all really welcoming.  They came around with a tray of chicken and waffle appetizers as well and again delicious.  I wish we stayed longer but left for dinner instead.  Looking forward to returning when their food menu is up and running officially."}
{"text":"I was here last night for an event. I sampled both of their signature cocktails featured for the evening - an old fashioned with rum instead of bourbon and a tequila cocktail that may have been some twist on their Judy Blue Eyes. I rounded out the night with a classic vodka martini with olives ($14). All three cocktails were good though I found the martini a tad watery. I sampled their bison sliders and thought they had a kind of funky smell and they were very messy, but pretty tasty despite. Next I tried the \"Taters\" which were nice and crispy but a tad oily tasting. In addition, I tried their bacon butter popcorn. Okay, I am a bit biased here because these three ingredients make my life worth living, so obvi I enjoyed. The best thing about this place as far as I am concerned was the ambiance and the staff. I like this small moody basement establishment. I think it has a good vibe. And I found each staff member I interacted with was personable; yes perhaps they could have been a bit more attentive, but I certainly didn't feel snubbed or ignored in the least.

I am a big fan of this area. For an occasion, I would for sure be inclined to drop by here again."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails. Even more amazing for Happy Hour, when cocktails go from $14 to $8. (Weekdays from 5 to 8pm) Happy Hour food items too!

Hipster bartenders, cool decor, dim lighting in a basement but everything's very classy. 

Free bottled water too to sip in between cocktails."}
{"text":"If you like libraries and well-made cocktails, then this is your place! My inner nerd was very happy to be enjoying cocktails in a cozy corner of the restaurant surrounded by old books. The place has a very cozy, prohibition-era style atmosphere. But don't worry, it's not super dark like some of the other speakeasy-like places. The lighting and sound levels were perfect for an intimate gather, whether it's for a date, a drink before or after dinner with work colleagues or for catching up with an old friend. It's not really a party atmosphere if that's what you're looking for. I've been here twice and had a great experience with the service both times! We were celebrating a friend's birthday during my most recent visit and we had brought a cake. They were more than happy to cut and serve the cake (without an extra charge!). We even forgot to bring candles, and one of the servers ran across the street to the grocery store to grab some. To top it all off, our server told us when we were settling the bill that the round of lemon drop shots we ordered (best lemon drop shots I've had too), was on the house! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This sort of place isn't typically my sort of place, but I love a cheap cocktail and happy hour at D.W. Alexander means that you can drink $8 cocktails between 5 - 8 pm  from Tuesday through Friday. That's $5 off the normal $13 price tag (yeah, I have math skills). Speaking for the happy hour window only, the service is good, the music isn't too loud, and the place isn't very crowded. A really good spot for an after work drink."}
{"text":"I stopped by this quaint little cocktail bar with a bunch of coworkers on a quiet Wednesday night for happy hour. 

First things first, they gave us complimentary popcorn which is always a bonus. Happy hour drinks feature $6 pints, $7 wine and $8 cocktails. My moscow mule was delicious and no one had complaints about any of their drinks.

I also tried their duck slider and mushroom melt. Of the two, my favourite was the mushroom melt. I do wish that they expand their food menu as there wasn't a lot of choices. But I can understand that they are more focused on drinks rather than food. 

On the negative side, service was a little off that night. Our server had difficulty remembering our orders since there were 10 of us (why couldn't he just write it down?) In the end we literally wrote down our orders on a notepad and handed it to him. As well, there was a little mix up with the bill. Even though the mushroom slider was priced at $4 on the menu, they charged us $5 for it on the bill (maybe the menu pricing wasn't updated?)

That aside, we still had a great time, and I would definitely come back for more happy hour drinks in the future."}
{"text":"A small spot tucked away off church near St. Lawrence Market. Space is cozy and inviting and reminds you of a modern suburban living room. There are high tables and low ones with  armchairs and high backed couches. The crowd is definitely mature and mostly professionals. The DJ played a nice mix of old-school funk and pop that added to the ambience. 

The bartenders know what they are doing, I got a whiskey cocktail called the Duchess. And my date got one called Penicillin. There are plenty more choices so you won't get bored quickly !

Check out this bar for fancy cocktails and interesting surprises. Worth a night out!"}
{"text":"I have never felt so bad about an experience in my life. The bouncer was an an absolute horror. Yes I am east Indian and generally don't feel racisim in this country. But he called me a pakki and I was shocked. I'm surprised that people think it's possibly acceptable to say such things. My brother was not let in and I asked why? I asked repeatedly and then he said the racist comment. Ruined my experience as a Torontonian. Is this what we have come to????"}
