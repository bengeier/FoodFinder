{"text":"This place has been renamed a few times but the good food still remains the same. I wouldn't bring a party more than 4 or 5 the Max."}
{"text":"Great food!  Just happened to see it while getting my car detailed across the street. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best local Thai food hands down! I recommend Kung Pow with steamed tofu and additional pineapple."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me.  We stopped here on a Thursday night around 6:15pm and the place was almost full.  It's a very small little space in a small little Strip Mall next door to a Dairy Queen.   The service was generally good but missing some enthusiasm and character.

We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and a combination fried rice (for sharing with a toddler).  Both dishes were just A-OK.  The pad thai was something I've had a hundred times at many other places and didn't have a flair about it that would encourage me to return to try it again.  They have a very large menu and I would consider returning to try something else.  

The chicken fried rice was, well, it was just chicken fried rice.  There are not many options for toddlers in Thai restaurants.  It was good enough for her and for us to share.  

I did appreciate the unlimited soft drinks - especially since they were serving sodas in cans.  Most places charge for each can drink.  Siri Thai didn't do that.  

All in all - a place that we would probably try again.  It's convenient to our neighborhood and worth a second meal."}
{"text":"First Yelp review and unfortunately it's not a good one if I had a zero I would give them a zero mostly based on customer service. I was not satisfied with my order I did not eat my food I was not once asked if my food was ok i decided to not finish my food and leave, they offered a to go box,  I said sure maybe someone else will like it. I chose not to leave a tip based on the poor service and because the food was not the best. As I'm exiting they are yelling at me from the counter, \"no tip!, no tip!\" Which I found extremely rude. Come to find out they went ahead and charged the tip anyway honestly I don't care about the money but it's the principle. And If I'm not mistaking it's illegal but the amount is not worth my time so instead I'm giving them a bad review."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I got a 2/5 and my girlfriend got a 4/5 spice level for chicken pad Thai. She crushes all spicy foods! But this garbage was so spicy we could only handle a couple bites...waste of 25 bucks, mine was definitely not a 2 so they screwed that up. The first time we had it, they got the spice levels right but it was just mediocre pad Thai. Would not reccomend this place, plenty of other Thai out there."}
{"text":"I love thai food, but this place was not good at all!! That's my honest opinion! 
I ordered seafood fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, beef chow mein and egg rolls.
The seafood in the rice tasted old!
The sweet and sour chicken was soggy! 
The beef in the chow mein no taste.
The only  good thing it was the egg rolls! 
I spent $48. Something
And it wasn't worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Fresh served everytime! My favorite is the Pad Thai and, new on the menu, Calamari. Yum! Also, the Tom Yum soup is really good. Siri Thai is the best Thai restaurant in Henderson."}
{"text":"I'm really enamored with this place. Yes the staff can be a little abrupt but they mean well. Everything on the menu is amazing. The curries are a must and the egg wrapped pad Thai. Tried the egg foo young and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't greasy or over cooked. I give this the \"don't think just eat\" two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food is always excellent, however, the service was really bad tonight. No one asked if we would like refills, in fact after meals were delivered no one came back until I went up to the register requesting a to go box. Bummer, we love this place, however, I don't think the feeling is mutual. :("}
{"text":"Would not come back here again. The food was not spicy at all the crispy pork was hard as a rock the thai beef jerky was tough as shoe leather and the garlic chicken was bland. The service was fine which is why it gets two stars but the food was funkey. About as thai as panda express."}
{"text":"This place has really fresh tasting,  delicious  food.  First time I've been here and it's nothing short of great"}
{"text":"Siri Thai took over where a King & I restaurant used to be. I had been to the King & I a few times and found it to be good but not great.

Siri Thai is a significant improvement over King & I as I was happy to discover.

My friend and I began by sharing a Som Tom Papaya Salad, which was very fresh and flavorful. We then shared an order of Pad Thai with shrimp which was one of the best Pad Thai's I've had. Very tasty and not at all greasy. We also shared an order of vegetables with a spicy mint sauce. We asked for the hotness to be a 4 on a scale of 5, and it turned out that the spiciness over-powered the flavor of the mint and vegetables. No fault of the restaurant. It was our first time there and will now better in the future.

The restaurant was very clean and attractive and the wait staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The food is extremely tasty and the prices are more than fair.  I was surprised by just how quickly the food was brought out too.  As for the service, it was excellent.  Both the server and the cook were bright, happy, and welcoming.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a tasty Thai lunch without having to break their wallets!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to pick up a little lunch for me and my wife. Did not get a smile or greeting when I walked in which is very unusual for any Thai establishment.  :(   Lady asks me if I am dining in or taking out. I give her my order of chicken satay, red chicken curry, and pad see ew. Chicken satay was like rubber. Either chicken is of very low quality or stale!  My red chicken curry was just as horrible, could barely chew the rubber like chicken. The pad see ew was a little better but will never go back!!
My total was $36 which is a little high, but if the food was great I would be ok with the price. Anyone who thinks this is good Thai food has never had great Thai food. :(
I would rather drive to the west side 30 miles away for ARCHIES THAI"}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the ratings but now my trust for Yelp is shaken. This place was terrible. The only good thing I can say is the dining area is comfortable. The service is very unwelcoming and stern. I'd be cool with that if the food was decent, it wasn't. If you're sensitive to spice steer clear of anything that has a spice level since a 1 from a 1-5 spice rating isn't consistent per dish. The spring rolls were Vietnamese summer rolls and were so poorly prepared, packaged, and filled. They wrapped them in saran-wrap and left them whole. They were a gooey mess broken open by the rice paper turned to glue on the cellophane. Iceberg lettuce, mint, celery, cilantro, pork, undercooked chicken, carrot and shrimp. The filling is described vegetables with these 3 meats. Mint celery bbq pork shrimp, isn't appetizing let alone being wrapped in glue. The peanut sauce was thin, watery, and mostly tasted of ginger and sugar. Really not expected or enjoyable. The pad Thai was gross, greasy and inedible. We had to toss our dinner. Very disappointed about this place with so many raving reviews. If I hadn't checked in I'd have thought I went elsewhere, now I wish I did."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was too greasy.   It just didn't taste authentic Thai    The food used to be better here."}
{"text":"Went here with the family and ordered a Thai Tea and Wonton Soup, the tea was good and the soup was just plain and didn't have much flavor. The service was sub-par, our waitress wasn't very hospitable and didn't seem to really care about us. She kept returning over to a table of other employees to talk and eat. About 15 minutes after I started eating my meal I got an upset stomach and I started feeling very sweaty.  My symptoms still persist 4 hours after our visit and I now have diarrhea. Ironically, in the window they have a certificate from Yelp that says their restaurant has received excellent reviews on this website, however, take a quick glace at the most recent reviews and you see otherwise. I never see more than a group of people in here, probably after the bad health inspection back in 2013. So, would I return to Siri Thai for a meal? Nah, I'd pass, but I do recommend you give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Siri for years, and mostly have it delivered to my home. I love their yellow curry, basil chicken..and my current favorite, almond chicken with lots of water chestnuts. I could go on and on!! They are always accurate and courteous..and fast for home delivery. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.. I just love this place. Simple, clean and low key Thai restaurant.  Food taste really good. I love almost everything in the menu. Their red curry shrimp, tom kha, pad thai and chow mein are so delicious."}
{"text":"I think their food is awesome but I just had the worst phone customer service experience I could have imagined. After giving my cross-streets the girl said they deliver. After a mysterious disconnect and reconnect she said they would not deliver no matter how long the wait because \"her list is 3 miles long.\" I asked for a quote if I pick it up. The price she quoted was outrageous, perhaps double their in store price. They just lost a regular customer. I'll never call them again."}
{"text":"The food is very good here and will go back again.  However, what is up with the service and the lady at the front desk?  I had a take-out order and wanted to ensure the order was correct.  She hastily took the food out of the bags and left it on the counter and went into the backroom in a huff, leaving me to put the large order back into the bags.  I only wanted to ensure the order was correct, as there was another large order next to mine.  You may want to work on the customer service aspect of your business, as you have the food part in very good order."}
{"text":"The place is small but cute and the food is just okay. We tried the basil fried rice with vegetables and panang chicken curry. The last time I had basil fried rice was in my fave thai neighborhood restaurant in Toronto and the rice here just did not cut it! It was more chilly and needed more salt...I counted about 10 chillies in the whole dish(as I had ordered a 3/5 on the hotness ratio;)
My easy to please man found the panang curry just ok too. We also tried the iced coffee which was too sweet for me.
The staff was friendly but took long to take our order even though the place was relatively empty.
overall, its ok...i've had better!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Today is my first time here and I loved it. Way better prices then I thought they would have after I noticed the menu on window while walking by. I work close to here and I will certainly be back. Their lunch specials are hard to beat as far as price and quality. Service was great as well all the staff were smiling and very pleasant. The decor was nice and the whole place was neat and clean."}
{"text":"I would come back to try more dishes! Had the beef see ewe n Singapore noodle, yummmm :)"}
{"text":"They stop serving in dining room half hour before they close. But take out till close.
Yum Wen Sen Salad is my taste test for any Thai restaurant.  This one was classic with lots of ground pork and big shrimp.  I ordered a 3 on the 1-5 - I could have used a 5, but I dig spicy, spicy food.  3 was pretty mild to me.   Pleasant staff, casual warm environment, made us feel welcome even though it was late when we got there."}
{"text":"Very Unfortunate. I had very high hopes that this place would replace my go-to Thai in the area but that's not happening.  Was never told that their Heat Scale was 1-5 (we thought it was 1-10) so we ordered our dishes at \"2\" which turns out to be pretty effin hot. My lunchmate had hers brought back and taken down to \"0\" and it was STILL hot (and she paid for it later with a stomach ache) - it took less than five minutes to replace the dish, so I would guess that they just strained the sauce of the Red Chili Flakes and dumped it back on the same serving dish! Guess what Siri Thai, it was STILL TOO SPICY!! My order was just too hot to eat: I tried to brave it out to no avail. The beef curry was disgusting. I've never been to a Thai restaurant that didn't serve thinly-sliced beef, but what Siri Thai finds acceptable to serve was huge chunks of chewy, grisly and EXTREMELY SPICY meat, that after forcibly chewing on one piece, I had to run to their bathroom to expel it. I tried the sauce over the rice, which the server insisted would make it palatable... not a chance - too spicy for a \"2\". When I made note of that my dish was inedible, the server flew into a rage and insisted that this was what I ordered, and insisted that she gave me their Heat Scale of 1-5, an outright LIE, and she would not take it off my bill. She even argued that she told me the Heat Scale but I was too busy talking to my lunchmate - insulting and another outright LIE!  Saving myself from a scene, I paid in-full and vowed to never return. AVOID."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! If I could give them 0 stars I would!
We tried calling the establishment at opening to place our order, only to find ourselves still waiting 40 minutes later. I kid you not, 40 minutes to place an order and still no answer!!! If you open at 11am why are you still not answering your phone at 11:40?? I heard good things about this place and so I was really excited to try the food, but due to the extremely unprofessional manner I won't even bother. Siri Thai, you're a waste of time!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Atmosphere was splendid! Can't go wrong with their Panang or their Siri Fried Rice."}
{"text":"I love this place. I honestly think it's one of the best in town. I live close so we order carry out all of the time. Family run Thai restaurant. Very authentic. Food always excellent and good and very reasonably priced.  They have some of the best soups and curry's that I have ever had. Basil fried rise is bomb. Thank you Siri Thai!!!"}
{"text":"It was the first thai place ever I tried in vegas, and it ended up being my favorite. I come here way too often for lunch with my co workers. But the service and the food are awesome. Basil duck is the way to go! Since it is a pretty small place, the only downside is at rare very busy time, the food comes very very slow at big big parties."}
{"text":"Ordered Tom Yum Soup, Green Curry Tofu, and Spicy Eggplant with Tofu. Was dining with my vegetarian daughter so I to ate vegetarian. Everything was fantastic and the portions were generous and service was great. Charming decor as well. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Portions are large. Very quaint and quiet. Staff is friendly and reasonably priced. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Always love eating here. Friendly staff, prompt, attentive service, great selection & absolutely delicious. Every time."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing food. I hated Thai completely until I had this place. there seafood anything is awesome. I recommend there pad thai, there Singapore noodles and their fried rice. the soups are amazing to. Avoid the spring rolls as I didn't care for them. but the entrées are simply amazing."}
{"text":"Curry was alright , but the meal was undercooked abd I didn't like how the salad was just tossed onto the plate."}
{"text":"Yay! Found the spot for tasty Thai cuisine during my lunch break. For $6.95 you get the soup of the day, salad, scoop of rice, fried wonton, eggroll, and your choice of entree. Service was quick and nice, and you really can't beat that bill for a filling lunch! Will definitely be back here again and again.. they use a different type of noodle for their Pad Thai, but it was really good! More like a thinner chow mein noodle than the typical flat noodle."}
{"text":"All the hype on the reviews had my expectations set high. I went here and wanted to enjoy a simple Thai Dinner. Salad, Appetizer, entree, Dessert. Started off with Some Egg rolls and they would have been great if they weren't cooked 5 minutes prior to them coming out. Ordered the salad, then Entrees. Got one of the entrees, and the Pad See Ew came out 10 minutes after. After we are almost full, THE SALAD CAME! What in the world? I forgot I ordered that! Then I had her take it back considering we were completely finished with both entrees. Well I wish I didn't do that because now we have them saying negative things in Thai about us, and the Chef came out to see who made them take the salad back, and the bill came 13 minutes after the first time I asked. Interesting that it was only us, then two other tables there so it wasn't as if they were so busy! But 1hr and 10 minutes seemed to be excessive for such an easy execution of a dinner. Unfortunately I wont be back here anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Hate leaving bad reviews but this is unacceptable! There was a twist tie in our takeout. The other dishes tasted just ok but this is a deal breaker for me"}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks back and for a Thai place I was not very impressed at all. The pad Thai was very subpar,nothing to write home about. The service however was good and the food arrived quickly. I will tell as I've been here on one other occasion for take out, their egg drop soup is the bomb!"}
{"text":"This place is my jam! I work very close to this delicious restaurant and can't get enough of it! The staff is very friendly and the food always hits the spot. Doesn't get better than Siri Thai! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! It's very close to my house, and replaced King and I which I didn't care for, so was hesitant to try this one. Glad I did! I tried some new things: Tom Yum soup-fantastic blend of flavors, their pad thai is really good, and my husband loves their beef jerky appetizer. 
I also love their fresh spring rolls. Oh, and one of my favorite things is the Thai Tea..kind of an ice tea drink, with cream. Be aware, though, that it is very sweet, but delicious. I have taken all of my out of town guests here over the past couple of months (I had a month with alot of company!) and they loved it as well. I have a favorite server, Julie, who has a great sense of humor and makes the visit more lively. It's a little hole-in-the-wall place, but the decor is very comfortable, and personal with pillows in the booth for comfort. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a while now. My only regret is that I haven't! Went in tonight for takeout. They were friendly, my food was ready quickly! The majority of the reviews stated that their spice level is a little higher than most, so I was cautious. Next time I'll definitely \"level up\" as I felt it was spot on. Anyway, basic order of yellow curry & crab rangoons, it was delicious! The portion size was more than enough for two! I'm so happy to have finally tried Siri! And happier that I won't have to drive across the city for amazing Thai food again!"}
{"text":"Considering that they were shut down in August by the health department, and just got a C a couple of days ago at the next inspection is enough for me to write them off. It lets me know they really don't care about the health and safety of their customer. Last Thursday I got their tom yum soup with shrimp which came out to $12.36 because they don't take card payments for orders under $15. So you're already raping me with your overpriced MSG filled soup, but now add extra .50 cent penalty because my order is under $15. Anyway, I had the soup and shortly after got a headache and upset stomach. I know my body and the reactions it has to certain foods, and I can say with 100% certainty that soup was an MSG filled mess. I am happily writing this place off."}
{"text":"Good little Thai spot. Their padThai was a little mushy and drowned in sauce but there Tom Ka was delicious and served in a beautiful soup pot. My daughter absolutely loved their fried rice and I think I need a second trip to give a better review."}
{"text":"Small little place with its own charm.  Service a bit slow but understandable due to language barrier with our server.  She was new.  Our meal was delicious!  I was so happy to find my Singapore noodles on the menu."}
{"text":"The pad see ew can be described in three words: Eww eeww ewww! I hate to say it, but I'd give this place zero stars if I could. I was in the area and since this Thai restaurant had 4 out of 5 stars, I thought I'd give it a try. Seemed like a sure bet...I mean 4/5 stars on yelp, can't go wrong with that right?! Wrong! 

I've had my fair share of Thai food and this has to be the absolute worst. I ordered pad see ew to go since I was headed to the airport but decided to taste my order while in the car (what can I say, my hunger got the best of me). I opened the box and the smell was just horrid. This \"fresh\" meal smelled so spoiled my stomach turned!


Side note for those of you who still want to give this establishment a try (even though I don't recommend it): they only take credit card on orders of $15 or more"}
{"text":"Just finished my first meal for this place! All I can say is AMAZING. the staff is very kind and you can tell they actually appreciate your business and care about making you happy. My girlfriend and I are vegan, and the lady taking our to go order eagerly asked if we were vegetarian/vegan so she could alert the cooks. That's something you don't see. Ever. 

The food was delicious. I am a Thai lover, and cannot get enough of any sort of curry and Siri Thai does it right. The spice is there, but not overpowering the flavor. I highly recommend this spot if you're considering it!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I eat here too much. It's not because of just the food, the service, or the atmosphere; it's because with all three qualities combined Siri Thai provides a tasty, comfortable and joyful experience. Julie and her chef mom (I don't think they're the owners) are always welcoming and pleasant; it's like going to a friends house and having dinner.  

I recommend the Basil Duck."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I'm a vegetarian, and my boyfriend loves to eat meat. I hate spicy food, he loves spicy food. I'm also allergic to a ton of things. When we feel like Thai, we always go here, and we both get exactly what we want. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for lunch. The service was excellent and the location is cute. It's a small space but has an upscale feel to it. I ordered hot and sour soup, for around $6.95, and it was served in a very large bowl. My husband got pad Thai for around $10.95, and it was also a good portion size. We ended up sharing our dishes, as our server kindly brought out plates and bowls for sharing. My one criticism was the hot and sour soup was very good but a bit too sweet for my taste. However, I'm used to Chinese hot and sour soup, so it may be that this is the way Thai hot and sour soup normally tastes. All in all, we were pleasantly surprised and will likely visit again."}
{"text":"I'd give this place more stars if they didn't lack in hospitality. I mean could you just crack a smile??? I mean even when I say thank you they can't even acknowledge the courtesy that is being passed to them. I'm a server myself and of Thai background, ladies...find a little zen in your life. Serving is a great job and I enjoy what I do. 

Great food though, just too many resting bitch face waitresses."}
{"text":"This was our favorite local THAI food, but the past two trips the chicken changed and tasted cheap and rubbery. We will no longer be going here. This is unfortunate because it is right down the street and Thai is our favorite!"}
{"text":"They are understaffed.

This place is located in a plaza and you really have to drive around in the plaza to find it. It's a small hall in the wall.

We walk in and no one greets us, the hostess is taking an order over the phone. 
We sit ourselves. 
Five minutes later we get the menu. We give our appetizer, food, and drink order another 10 minutes later because no one would come by our table. 

The phone seems to be ringing every 5-10 minutes and it is apparent that people are waiting for their take out.

Appetizers come out one by one, probably 20 minutes after we ordered them.

My gf gets her beef satai probably 20 minutes after the appetizers.

I get my pork chow mein probably 30 minutes after I we got the appetizers (40-50 minutes after I ordered it initially).

The food was good, but we spent a good amount of time just waiting for it to come.

I probably would not come back here... they really need to get more cooks/waitresses.."}
{"text":"Best beef fried rice I've had in a very long time! The soup was pretty good. It came in a huge bowl for the table. Of course they give you smaller bowls and a dipper to serve yourself. My boyfriend ordered Pad Thai and devoured it before I was able to take a picture. He enjoyed it. But I couldn't get enough of that fried rice."}
{"text":"They have one of the best Thai beef salad. I went there with my sister and I really liked the food. But the girl kept on getting my order wrong. I decided to try again and took my daughter. It was crazy. We were the only ones there for lunch and one girl took my order, another girl brought our food, I asked for extra rice and a different girl brought it to our table and when we were ready to pay for bill someone completely different came over. They were not promp either. None of them smiled or looked like they wanted to be there. I always teach my girls to say \"Thank you\". When my daughter said \"Thank you\" after one of the waitress fill our glass with water the girl just walked away without responding. I felt the whole time they couldn't wait for us to leave. They were also very rude."}
{"text":"My fiancé come here a lot for the lunch specials, they have always been friendly and welcoming. 

When we go for lunch, we both usually get the red curry. we love spicy food so we order it with a 4/5 spice level. It is outstanding. The lunch specials come with soup, salad, the main dish you choose and for a dollar more you can order a Thai tea or coffee. 

This is the best thai restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas. I would recommend it forsure."}
{"text":"We ate here last week and were blown away by the fabulous food.  We have been looking for our go-to thai restaurant and now we have found it.  It is much better than that other thai restaurant that is always mentioned on tv food shows, plus is it much closer to our home.  We had the panang curry with chicken, green curry with shrimp, Siri Thai fried rice, thai beef salad and papaya salad.  Sounds like a lot and it was.  We took a lot of food home and waited patiently until the following day so we could devour the leftovers.  They didn't make it past noon.  We have been craving it for days already and plan to go there about once every other week.  The flavor of the panang curry was so good, you could taste the ginger or galangal and citrus and even the peanuts.  It was out of this world good.  We ordered all our dishes with a spice level or 2 or 3 and they were all just perfect.  We enjoy spicy but not so spicy where you cannot still taste the flavors."}
{"text":"Really good fresh thai food! My mom & I went stopped here for dinner since we've been trying different thai places. The crab rangoons were so yummy! If you love cream cheese get them! We also had crab fried rice, thai lettuce wraps, and the mango and sticky rice for dessert. Everything was so good! They serve you three different sauces with the lettuce wraps, and each portion was huge. The service was good. The girl working there was very nice and she was very attentive with filling up our water glasses. They serve beer and wine, have takeout, and delivery via bitesquad.
Everything in relation to the restaurant was great, however we would've enjoyed it more if the people next to us weren't emitting some sort of B.O. sweaty feet kinda smell. I don't what it was but it was not pleasant. But anyway the food and service was great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I always like to know what is in my neighborhood for those nights when I'm lazy and need to call in a pick-up order.  This place is pretty rad for that.  Don't ask me about authenticity as I am not normally a Thai food person, but what they do have is phenomenal for me and that gives it a warm fuzzy place in my food-loving heart.

The restaurant has that family-ran feeling and I always get awesome service.  Though I do not come here often enough for me to think they would, they DO remember who I am and how I like my rice.  That is always a pleasant surprise.  =)  The restaurant itself is very cozy and has lots of vibrant décor to immerse yourself in the experience instead of just ordering a meal.

While there is a small fee (50 cents I think?) if your order is under $15 and you pay by card, it still does not deter me from ordering their Fried Rice Thai Style with chicken and cashews for a pick-up dinner.  It is consistently amazing and provides a wonderful leftovers meal.  Other delectable dishes here are their spring rolls and Thai tea (which is awesomely sweet).  If I wasn't so darn attached to that rice I would definitely try the Singapore Noodles and Pad Thai.

The prices can be a touch high but they do not skimp on portions.  When my friends order the other dishes the to-go box is piled so high you can barely close the lid!  Yes, this is a positive for me.  -;)"}
{"text":"I thought this place was just okay. I got take out a month ago and can't remember what I got because it wasn't, well, memorable. It gets 3 stars because it wasn't bad, but not great. Nothing stood out to make me go back when there are so many other great options in town."}
{"text":"Excellent value on the lunch specials. Food was great. Thai tea is my favorite and they didn't disappoint me! Service was fast friendly and professional.  We will be back even though it's 20 miles from home thru traffic that sucks."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5 years and absolutely my favorite Thai restaurant.  The place is clean and the staff is always friendly.  

I usually take my daughter and we both get cucumber salads and share the chicken fried rice with Thai ice tea."}
{"text":"After a few visits to Siri Thai I can give a very solid 4 if not 4.5 stars to this albeit small but well run Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.
First let me point out there are at least 1000 Thai or Thai/Chinese style restaurants in Vegas and most are about average. There are some standouts and I would define them based on quality of menu selections and authenticity. If they serve deep fried shrimp or egg rolls or any of those other pseudo Chinese dishes I don't consider them a \"Thai\" restaurant.

Siri Thai started off as an offshoot of the popular Thai/Chinese restaurant \"King and I\" on Maryland which built a location in Summerlin as well.
The relationship only lasted about a year due to the exact type of differences on menu that I outline above. King and I is very Thai/Chinese and Siri wanted to be more of a traditional Thai restaurant.
Enough history, now to get to the review. 
With some great traditional dishes and specials Siri Thai has something for everyone who enjoys authentic Thai Cuisine. Their menu is a bit short but I feel this allows them to focus on quality.
Their ingredients are always prepared fresh and their service is very good.
The owners mother still works in the kitchen overseeing the quality of the dishes and you can be assured your meal will hit the table hot and prepared with care.


If you like Thai its worth the trip up Eastern to check out Siri Thai.

On a side note.
Unlike some establishments that question Americans seeking spicy food Siri will make the food as spicy as you'd like. Believe it or not there are times when restaurants refuse to spice the dish as you request opting rather to bring it on the side and let you add it yourself. I think this relieves them from liability and the option of you sending the dish back to the kitchen.
Lotus of Siam also will make the meal as you request which is another trade mark of an authentic Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I was really craving thai food when I was at a friends house, and this place was super close so we decided to order delivery. We got the pad se ew, chicken fried rice, yen ta fo, and thai beef jerky.

The delivery was pretty fast.
The yen ta fo was so delcious. Spicy broth with flat noodle, garlic, chili, ginger, seafood, tofu, bok choy. It was amazing. A little Spicer than most but not by much. Still ediable. The fried rice was pretty standard and but the thai beef jerky was incredible. The best I ever had. The spicy sauce that came with it was perfect. That alone deserves 5 stars.

I definitely want to come back to dine in soon."}
{"text":"I had an amazing dinner with friends here! We ordered egg rolls, tom kha soup with chicken, papaya salad, beef pad thai, crispy duck(?), yellow curry w/ chicken. The soup and the curry were excellent! By far, the best tom kha I've had in town so far, a plus being the presentation of the soup. It comes in a clay pot over a burning flame. The atmosphere has a warm, comfy feel even though its a small space. The staff was friendly and attentive & they even gave my 7 yr old daughter extra treats at the end which I thought was nice.  I recommend checking this place out & we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was really glad I was able to try this place out. My best friend was craving some Thai food, so Thai food it is. It's not a huge restaurant but enough to fit about 80 people.It seemed to be like a family owned business. Decorations were cute and it really fit the 'Thai style' We started with the chicken satay, chicken was delicious and juicy and the peanut sauce was good as well. They also served some pickled bell peppers and oh man I was a fan of those. We ordered the crab fried rice and the yellow chicken curry. The crab fried rice is must have, they serve it with chunks of real crab meat which I was shocked to see, but it was delicious. The yellow chicken curry was yummy as well served with potatoes and carrots. I will definitely be coming back to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Everything was great.  The Tom Kha soup was the best I've ever had and the hubs loved the chicken satay!  I ordered the egg wrapped pad thai and it was delicious but I would probably just try the regular pad thai next time.  The spice levels are better than most places. I got a spicy level 4 out of 5 and it didn't kill me but it was spicy enough.  Most places I can order the spiciest and it's not spicy enough."}
{"text":"Brother comes here a lot and recommended the place to me. I think it's delicious. I got the wonton soup which i was disappointed by. Had no flavor at all. Would've made a world of a distance. Just tasted like boiled water. I got this late late night so I don't know if that had something o do with it.. also ordered the crab fried rice. Very good. Just could've had more crab in it."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge Thai food fans. We decided to try Siri out and we were pleasantly surprised. By far the best Thai food in Las Vegas. Must try...better than most Thai food in Chinatown."}
{"text":"We live very close, and it was raining, so we tried the delivery.  VERY FAST. (the poor delivery girl braved some pretty hard rain, too).  Food was hot and fresh!  Great flavor, too.  The Pad Thai was not the best I've ever had, but it was good and fresh.  The pineapple fried rice was huge!  Large shrimp and very fragrant.  We will probably order from this place at least once a month."}
{"text":"When it comes to local spot for Thai this is my favorite!  Cute little place, friendly and the food is delicious!  I'm a sucker for basil shrimp and some Thai iced tea!  But that pad Thai is SO good!  We've eaten in the restaurant and also just picked up take out and the quality is the same and great!  Def recommend this place for your Thai fix!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure as a first time customer... Already have a favorite Thai place and Tom Yum Shrimp down the street on Sunset... But didn't want to drive so far tonight after work. Headache was killing me, and all I can say is I ordered and picked up within ten minutes, and of course, Tom yum shrimp spicy 3 (out of 5)---- friggin PERFECT. Now the best Tom yum I've had in town. And may I just say full of shrimp! A nice surprise not getting ripped off with like 3 shrimps, definitely had at least 6 but I was so happy eating I lost count. Wonderful surprise. The flavor was just absolutely on point. Wish it had more mushrooms, will def add veg next time. Lady on phone was well-spoken and pleasant, quoted me 10-15 minutes. The shop is quite small, maybe one large table and 8 smaller ones? But perfectly clean, cool, and now my favorite fast food Thai. Give them a try. 

Ok update:

This time I tried the fresh spring rolls (they're combination w pork shrimp and chicken) and pad se ew chicken. Flavors on point again. Chicken in pad se ew was a little over cooked, but it's a to go order so that's my fault. Flavor perfect, really nice gravy. Good size portion. Spring rolls delicious and fresh, peanut sauce on the side is friggin perfect and a little less thick than usual which is nice to dunk. Definitely give these guys a shot."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating from there since moving to Henderson. Truly love the pad sew. Especially after a long hard day."}
{"text":"This small, but nice Thai restaurant wasn't a bad little spot.  My friend and I ordered the Tom Kha ($8.95), Pad See Ew ($8.95), and the Red Curry beef ($8.95).  I wasn't overly impressed with any of the food, but for this area of town I think this could be a little gem of a Thai restaurant.  

The Tom Kha with chicken was my favorite dish.  It had lot of fillers like lemongrass, galanga, tomatoes, and little red peppers that made my mouth scream!  It was nice and sour, and the chicken/mushrooms were right on par.  We ordered a 3 out of 5, and it was quite a bit spicy with that extra red pepper in it.  If you are sensitive to strong tastes or spiciness, you might ask them to tone this one down!

Next up was the Pad See Ew, which my friend liked a lot.  It was a bit saucy for me, which gave it a sweet and salty taste that was a bit much for my taste.  I prefer a drier, less saucy version of this dish.  The Chinese broccoli was good, along with the chicken. 

The red curry was suggested to us by the waitress as being one that wasn't sweet, so we ordered that with beef.  This was a very simple red curry - no sugar added.  There was a lot of bamboo in it, but the shoots were nicely prepared, so I liked them in this dish.  The only thing that was lacking was a real character or uniqueness to the curry.  I wouldn't say that it stood out at all; its just a basic, authentic red curry.  

Since this spot is on the opposite side of town, I wouldn't venture this far to come here when there are several really good Thai restaurants closer to me.  However, if I was in the neighborhood more often, I could make a habit of coming here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! Their sweet and sour chicken is delicious and pad see ewe is great! 
The owners are sweet and the workers are kind."}
{"text":"Wow, I was surprised reading all the good reviews, to find my to go order sub par. I had Tom Yum soup & it was a TON of chicken in clear spicy broth with mushrooms (normal quantity) & 2 pieces of tomato. There only other ingredients. Yes, I am not exaggerating, two (2) pieces of tomato... and nothing else in the soup. I have never had ANY soup from any restaurant, in my entire life, have less content. I don't get how it could've been served like that. I am sure the owner or manager is not aware of their food being served like that. Maybe they ran out & thought the 3/4 lbs of chicken would compensate. Truly way better to say you are out than to serve that. It's not a cheap bowl of soup either. I don't mind paying but I have to be able to eat it. Also got the beef jerky app, but I have to say it was way too dry & also not edible. Probably a bad app choice for pick up. It did have good flavor but the time it took to chew it up was just about comical. This meal was truly a Saturday night live skit.
I can tell from all the seasoned Yelper's, this was obviously an off day for them. $25 for soup & an appetizer....didn't care for it at all. Food was 1 star but gave 1 more because the cashier was nice."}
{"text":"Food was unimpressive, very sub par. Ordered the pad Thai- super soggy. Basil fried rice- alright but nothing I would order again. Panaang curry with meat combo- meh. Not something I would think about ordering again PLUS THEY ONLY PUT ONE SHRIMP IN THERE LOL. Why you guys skimping on the shrimp, are you guys rationing it? Egg roll- it was cool. I love Thai food. Love love love Thai food. And this def did not satisfy my craving. I remember ordering a fried rice plate from here last year and it was good enough for me to remember this place but maybe chefs changed ooooor something. Def not coming back here, just so unsatisfying."}
{"text":"So I tried to eat here but I guess they didn't want my business at all. I walk in with my girl and her daughter to eat dinner. At around 8:10pm. They advertise being open until 9pm online and on the front door. We were in the mood to sit down and eat. They tell us after coming in that the kitchen is closing and they would only do a to go only order. Now this is Thai food so how long can it really take to eat meal we probably would have been out of there before 9. Also there was another table of diners in the restaraunt eating at the time. With this kind of service why would I even waste my time. Now you get a one star review from me and I'll never return. Smart move, keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"The thought of eating here makes me happy. The Thai Beef Salad is so good I wish I could eat it every single day. I'd walk in and they'd say \"Oh Ryan, here's your beef salad!\", we'd high-five and I'd go home and enjoy my sweet prize.

Did I mention this food is awesome? Please stop reading this and just stuff your face."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst Singapore noodles I've ever had. No flavor.  Shrimp was so fishy tasting it didn't even taste like shrimp. Can't see me going back."}
{"text":"Siri was on the news.  They were trying to figure out why they were recycling rice. 
http://www.ktnv.com/dirtydining/Dirty-Dining-double-dose-Siri-Thai-and-Island-Malaysian-Cuisine-221564581.html 

Okay, I lied.  I went back.  The pad thai was calling.  This was a stupid move.  We attempted to eat here again on 8/15/13, and guess what!?  The health district has closed them AGAIN!  Over 70 demerits.  NEVER AGAIN!  You are asking to be hospitalized if you eat here.  

We have eaten here over a dozen times.  Walked by, tried to consider the Pad Thai, kept walking.

The Pad Thai is excellent here.  Sadly, you may be the second or third person presented with the same rice."}
{"text":"Me and my husband discovered this restaurant online. We have never actually been to the location before. 

The food is always very good. I regularly order the Thai veggie fried rice (extra hot) and they always deliver some of the best fried rice I have ever eaten. I also get their red curry which is always great. The portions are also HUGE. When I get the fried rice, I eat for at least three days. 

Also, every time we order they say it will be 45 minutes to get to our door and it never actually takes that long at all. Usually about 20 minutes or so. 

One other sort of special thing that they do is sometimes there is something a little special with our order. The first time we ordered they included some ginger candy. It was not very good but it was a nice surprise. Another time it was coconut cookies which my husband enjoyed very much."}
{"text":"So good! I've only had their green curry (but I've had it like three times because it's seriously that good). It's true that their spice levels seem to be a teeny bit higher than other thai restaurants I've been to, but only by a little bit. If you're scared of spice, I'd recommend ordering one level down from your 'usual' number."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and the lunch special was an exceptional value.  The curry we tried had a lot of great, fresh flavors that I normally don't get at other Thai restaurants I frequent.  I'm sad I don't live in the area, otherwise I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I don't understand all the good reviews when there's so many amazing Thai restaurants to go to in this city. 

First, walking in you get the oddest vibe. Nobody looked excited to see their FIRST customer at 7:30PM. That should've been our first sign. Empty restaurants during dinnertime is not a good thing, especially when the sushi place next-door was packed. The decor is dingy and old. Like an unkempt takeout restaurant... oh why did we stay. 

The only reason (besides lack of choice) for the one star was the young fresh coconut drink. It was a cold, fresh carved coconut. Right after that we ordered chicken satay and dumplings. They were OK, but nothing to brag home about. 

After that, everything went downhill quick. We ordered beef Penang. I've been in the restaurant business a long time and I'm also a very good cook myself, when food comes out way too fast--that's a problem. it's either been sitting there, or it's going to be severely under cooked. The dish came out and it was small chunks of extremely fatty chewy \"meat\". It was most definitely not beef. After two bites we realized it was pork. We tell the waitress it's not only pork, but it's bad fatty badly cooked pork. She said \"oh you want sliced beef?\" ...um yeah. That's what we ordered. She said \"ok this is stew meat\" .. ew. Keep that \"stew\" away from me. I felt like I ate a few pieces of fat flavored gum. She tried to accommodate,  I suppose. She brought the plate back to the kitchen and I heard a man screaming at her loud in Thai. Really unprofessional. 

About 10 minutes go by, and our tofu Pad See Ew came out. Again---wrong.  I don't know what's wrong with this place but whatever it is, isn't right. There were maybe 6-8 overcooked broken noodles, what feels like 1000° tofu on top at a different temperature (cooler) mix of vegetables. I'm starting to think they use microwaves because of the inconsistent temperatures throughout the plates. 

Minutes after that, the replacement beef Penang came out. Slightly better but not by much.. at least it was beef this time. 

We asked for the check and hauled out of there. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Small portions for the price! I've ordered chicken pad thai in many other restaurants & got double the portion size for the same prices as Siri Thai. I won't be trying this place again, noddles were dry & lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I felt that since we've made Siri Thai a weekly dinner night, it deserved 5 stars. Can't emphasize enough how friendly the entire staff is. The delivery is very quick and always fresh and hot. Wonderful variety of Chinese and Thai menu options. Favorite right now are the tom yum soup, massaman w/chix, Mongolian beef, crab rangoons and chix fried rice. YUM"}
{"text":"I had the papaya salad- a new favorite dish of mine. It was very good, I ordered it a 4 spicy (as they have a 1-5 scale) and it came out about a 3, which is fine.

For my entree I decided to try the house favorite, basil. I had it with tofu and also ordered it a 4. This time it came out perfectly spicy and was delicious! 

Service was great, and they boxed up all my leftovers for me. 
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials good! Their Crab fried rice was gd. Richard having red curry n me just the chow Mein. The service was not that great that day. Maybe because they are busy."}
{"text":"I've gotten the noodles from here many times and it is usually really good but today it was eh. The noodles were mushy and soft and they forgot the bamboo shoot in my Pad Kee Mao. Maybe the chef was replaced but I hope I don't experience this again."}
{"text":"Decent crowd here for dinner on a Thursday. We ordered Panang curry, green curry and Singapore noodles with sticky rice to start. Sticky rice was enjoyable. I only tried the green curry and Singapore noodles, but the green curry was really watery and not very flavorful. The Singapore noodles were a little better I liked the BBQ pork in it. Not my favorite Thai place by any means and probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"While this place is super delicious, I will never order from here again. Clearly they don't care either. 
Ordered through Postmates and hit reorder a separate time... the price was nearly doubled I called to 'complain' and was yelled at and said it was not their fault that I did not specify I wanted the lunch special. 
I really like this place so we ordered again today. I received a lovely little note in my order today  
The foods ok, but this little sarcastic note was the real treat! Also, I appreciate the white out used to make the spelling correction."}
{"text":"This small, tucked away restaurant is truly a hidden gem. I've driven past this place for years and never considered stopping in. I do love Thai food and was told by a friend this place has great food. After a quick little hike in the mountains with my wife, we planned on stopping in and giving this place a go. 

We arrived and we're greeted by a welcoming and friendly staff. The lunch specials are in line with other Thai restaurants. I ordered the red curry chicken and my wife ordered the chicken pad Thai and a Thai tea. I stole a quick sip from my wifes Thai tea, it was amazing, not too sweet, with quality tea. The lunch special comes with a cup of the soup of the day. This day was a delicious rice soup. Very rich in flavor and satisfying. The salad that came with the order was small yet delicious and just enough to prepare your pallet or the main course. The orders were delivered in a timely manner. My red curry chicken looked amazing and smelled the same. The spicy scale here is one through five. I ordered a 2 and it was just right. The flavor of the red curry was one of the best I've had. Deep, rich, and full of all the appropriate spices. My wifes chicken pad Thai at a number three for spiciness, was equally delicious. Perfectly cooked chicken and noodles with robust flavors was truly pleasing. The egg rolls and won ton chips were nice little additions to the lunch special. The portions appeared to be small however, we left full and satisfied.

When we finished I was mad at myself for never stopping by before. It will be a new mainstay for my list of lunch spots.  It was an extremely enjoyable meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Good food very little hole in the wall great home cook food service sucks but that's ok we just want the food to be good"}
{"text":"First time here ... The food was delicious and quite spicy. One of the best Curry's I've tasted next to Archi's Thai. I was slight disappointed when they brought my plate out because I was looking forward to eating the green beans that come with the dish (one of my fave parts) but there was none. The waitress was very nice, brought me out a house soup while I wait. Service was very fast as well."}
{"text":"Some Pros: 
They don't close in the middle of the day like most Thai restaurants
They deliver ($3 fee, $15 min purchase)

My fiance and I have eaten a LOT of Thai food in many places so we're Thai food snobs. If you're like us then you'll likely find this place as we did: mediocre.  

We've had of varying spice levels and veg/meat options:

Fresh spring Rolls \"Paw Pia Sod\"
Egg Rolls \"Paw Pia Tod\" 
Green Curry \"Kang Khiaw Wan\"
Bangkok Steak
Basil Fried Rice
Basil Duck
Fried Rice Thai Style*
Pad Lad Nar (on menu but I always thought it was 'lard na'?)
Panang Curry*
\"Tom Yum\" soup*

* = best picks from what we've tried

There seems to be a shortage of fresh vegetables in dishes (i.e. Panang curry with bell peppers is 5 tiny pepper strips (I've counted); fried rice dishe pics shown with cucumbers but comes with none, mushrooms are rubbery, etc).

We keep ordering because they deliver and it'll do in a pinch when one has a craving for Thai!"}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent customer service. my favorite is the salted fish fried rice and pad Thai."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Legit Thai Dining! Egg wrapped shrimp pad thai and dumplings so good! Singapore noodle is amazing!"}
{"text":"I come here once in a while because there's no wait to be seated and the food come out very quick. Even Friday and Saturday night, this place is either empty or just one or two customers sitting. I notice a lot of people order take out.
I like their Royal Grand (Seafood on a hot plate). I don't see that menu in any other Thai places in town so I guess it's their original.
Older lady in the store sometimes sit in the corner of the restaurant and use speaker phone and talk very loud in Thai. I felt like I was sitting in a local restaurant in Bangkok. It doesn't bother me but why does she have to use speaker phone??
I was sitting where I could see the inside of the kitchen. I saw this lady started making our spring roll right after she handled money without washing her hands. I didn't say anything because my friend ate it all and said it was delicious.
If you live in the neighborhood, this is a good take out place."}
{"text":"Another fantastic family run Thai restaurant discretely located at Pecos and Windmill. We've done takeout here several times and the food is just outstanding. The pineapple fried rice is excellent, and the pad see eew off the charts. Always friendly service and eager to serve you. The restaurant is small and cozy, making it a perfect location for conversation and date night. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Oh...Siri Thai, you sure have made me a devoted fan of your dish. I loved the cute space and decor! We ordered the chicken massaman is always my favorite thai dish and the flavor was full. We ordered medium spice and it was still too spicy for me so next time I'll be sure to request for mild. I'd say say medium spice tastes like a 6. We also had the Basil with beef and chicken. I'd highly recommend that dish as well. The entrees are good for two or three depending on how hungry the parties are, and I walked away with a $25 tab.

The service was wonderful, and they were all very attentive. I even noticed them offer a regular some water as he waited for his to go order. How nice of them to do that especially since the heat is dehydrating the crap out of us! 

I'll be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"The $7 lunch special here is where it's absolutely at. Lots of my IRL friends don't like this place, but whatever, I love it. 

Winners on the lunch menu are the red curry, pad thai, basil chicken. Not so much winners are nothing I have tried yet. 

The soups are always like a magical surprise. Will it be a coconut curry? An egg drop? Chicken deliciousness? I don't know, but I love knowing they'll put a taste of ecstasy in my mouth. (har har my name's Molly)

I think I may even like this place better than Penn's of late. Penn's got too expensive and the food is also lukewarm most of the time. Siri Thai is small, awesome, and a great lunch spot. I'm probs gonna go get some now because I'm hungry for it. Ta-ta!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical coming here, but I was craving Thai food! It's like a drug or something.  My favorite thai place in Las Vegas is actually quite some distance away, and this was one of those nights where I did not want to drive far to fix a craving.  So what did I do?  I went on yelp and started researching.  

First off, search Thai food in Henderson Area.  Siri Thai pops up and I start reading reviews.  Not much that caught my interest, but I decided to visit their website.  I was hungry and time was running short so I decided to call and place a take out order.  Lady picks up, accent. SUCCESS!  When I hear an Asian accent I think authentic cuisine...well sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.  

Here what I have to say about Siri Thai: 

I ordered 4 dishes that night (yes all for me, but I enjoy a variety of dishes and I can eat it for a span of about 3 days).  

Phad Kee Mao: This is my favorite Thai dish and every Thai restaurant I go to, I have to order it.  I'd have to say, I was very impressed with this dish.  All the right flavors where there, great ingredients, and they used the right noodles. A+!  If this was the only dish I ordered, maybe Siri Thai may have gotten 5 starts, however there were some downfalls in the other dishes.  

Stuffed Chicken Wings: Ok, this dish is not very hard to mess up.  I mean, it's fried chicken!  I opened up the foam box and it smelled wonderful, however that first bite was unforgivable! Old, dry, stale piece of chicken that was refried to heat it up....yes...refried.  How do I know?  because the stuffing inside was hard and unable to be chewed with satisfaction.  I don't know if this is how they serve the dish at Siri Thai, or if this was a one time thing and I was the lucky lottery winner that got the old piece of chicken...but it was bad.  *Tossed in the Trash*  minus 1 star! 

Tod Mon: This is another dish that I enjoy eating at thai restaurants.  Basically it is fish paste with green beans and seasons with fish sauce and other ingredients.  The flavors were all there in each bite, however each bite was accompanied by a shot of salt.  Yes, very salty!  If they lighten up on the salt, it'd be a wonderful dish!  

Pad Prig King: This was my first time trying this dish and I wasn't sure what it's suppose to taste like, but I enjoyed it.  Beef, green beans, green onions in a flavorful sauce.  Great with rice.  

Other tid bits is that rice is not included with your meal and you have to order it separately.  I was fine with that, however the rice was overdone and did not much substance to be chewed, rather it just mushed up in your mouth and dissolved. xD 

Customer service was excellent here!  The ladies that helped me were very nice and the interior decor was quite nice.  Felt like a typical Thai restaurant to me!  

I'd definitely be coming back here again, especially for their phad kee mao! 

P.S.  be careful with the level of spiciness...I ordered a 3/5 and it was pretty damn spicy!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I love it, the price, I don't love so much. It used to be quite affordable, but since we moved here December 2011 the price has gone up quite a bit! It's good, but not $35 good (while drinking water mind you!) I would eat there more, but I can't get over the price."}
{"text":"Out of 3 dishes 2 was sub par. We started off with the beef jerky, which was rubbery and tasteless. Then on to the chicken wings which was the only half decent dish, it was cooked perfectly and tasted like any other Thai restaurant. Last but and definitely the least was the Panang. I read a Review on yelp that said it was great... Wtf were they smoking? I like a thicker curry but it was almost gel like, and way too nutty, it tasted like peanut butter. 2 stars for decor because service was poop as well, we asked for no ice in our water and she said ok and then proceeded to put ice in the water. Then she brought our dishes and never checked on us, then left and I guess the other waitress didn't know she was supposed to get us until we asked for the check. Oh well all is fair in love and food."}
{"text":"Got the Kung pow lunch special. Wasn't too bad. I'm tired of banging my head against the wall trying to find an egg roll in this city. FAIL! Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious!! We ordered fried rice with beef, orange chicken, pad Thai and mama ordered the Jasmine rice soup. The fried rice was not salty or greasy. It was buttery and so tasteful. The Orange chicken wasn't drenched in sauce as most places do. Everything was just right! 
The food was done quick too."}
{"text":"Great fried rice. Great service. Nice to know there is a restaurant that I can get good fried rice"}
{"text":"I am so unimpressed with you, Siri. 

I met my homegirl Jaime W. for dinner after a long and stressful day. There was only one table with customers when we arrived, so I was looking forward to a good meal in a relaxed setting. What I got was a bland, boring meal served up by some of the worst waitresses I have ever had to deal with. Thankfully, I had good dining company!

Jaime was already seated when I arrived, and the waitress came over fairly quickly to take my drink order. It was all downhill from there.  Two men arrived shortly after I got my water and sat at the booth next to us. We were both surprised to see one of the waitresses taking their food order before taking ours... Perhaps I had left my menu open too long and they thought we were not ready to order, but a good waitress would have checked to see if we had any questions. This isn't a huge deal, I was there to catch up with a friend and waiting a little longer than normal to order just gave us more time to chat.

We ordered our food and went back to our conversation. Our meals came out relatively quickly and correctly (I had requested no onion in my dish). I just wasn't impressed with my Ginger Beef dish at all. There was an abundance of shredded ginger on the plate but the sauce itself was very bland. The steamed rice was mushy as well. 

By this time I was out of water. Also, the table that was seated when we arrived was done and ready to pay. I watched our waitress go to them with their check and take away their plates. She went back to get their credit card, took it to the cash register and back to their table. The other waitress was seated at the register during this time. At one point she stood up, looked over the register at the booth where the men were seated to see if they needed anything and then sat back down. Not even a glance in our direction, if she had I would have waved at her to get her attention...  Finally, Jaime got fed up and walked to the register to request refills. This is completely unacceptable in my opinion. 

Thanks to the piss-poor service coupled with the sub-par seasoning of my dish, I was over my meal. While the waitress was intelligent enough to see that I had left a lot of my meal on my plate (she asked if I needed a to-go box) she was not intelligent enough to ask if everything was ok with the food. 

Whatever. I won't be back.

EDITED TO ADD: Siri Thai was closed by the Health Department of Southern Nevada in August of 2013 for RECYCLING RICE. That is disgusting and has ensured I will never step foot in this place again. See for yourself here:

{"text":"Delicious curry!!! Perfect blend of herbs and spices, and the tofu is amazing. So glad this is close to my house! Definitely going again."}
{"text":"The food here is great, sometimes borderline amazing, however I believe 75% of a meal's quality comes from the service attached to it, and that is where Siri fails.  This small shop has a great thing going for them but they could do so much better if their employees pretended to care even a little bit.  Scoffing at my requests for more water, being annoyed that they messed up my order, and a number of other minuscule but important instances of mediocre service leave me no choice but to leave 3 stars.  
Maybe if the workers step it up a notch and pretend to give even the slightest semblance of courtesy, they'll get a 3.5."}
{"text":"Dumplings were served ice cold in the middle, then when they came out again they were so hot they burned my mouth. My guess is they are pre made frozen dumplings.  The staff at least took them off my check. 

The main dish was better and spicy, but lacked depth of flavor. The highlight of the meal was the service, which was courteous and very attentive."}
{"text":"My first time trying Thai food and EVERYTHING I tried was delicious!! Loved the small quaint feeling!! My favorite was definitely the Pad Thai. I'd definitely go back!! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 Thai places in Vegas! Archi's and Lotus are a little bit better. But this place has better prices. I love Thai food and don't care that much for Chinese food but I ALWAYS have to order the sweet and sour chicken when I go here. The batter is amazing! I also like the crab Rangoon here. The pad see ew is very good too!"}
{"text":"Good quality food for a neighborhood joint.  Out of all the thai restaurants in the neighborhood I like this place the best.

The people that work their are friendly and it actually looks like a nice place to hang out.

I had the Tom Kha, chicken larb, and pad thai.

None of these are the best I've had in town but, it taste good and work if you live five min away.

I liked all three and I'm going back tonight cause I'm craving some larb and duck curry and I don't feel like driving all the way komol, lotus of siam, or thai grill.

If you are in the nieghborhood def, hit them up."}
{"text":"The staff that work there are very rude, as soon as I walked through the door the lady caught and attitude with me ! After she brought our food she never came back and checked on us and when I didn't give a tip because of the horrible customer service she told me next time to give a tip or take my food to go! Horrible customer service will NEVER eat here again!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service not so much. The waitress was very uninterested and inattentive. Oh well it you want your spirits lifted or like a joyful atmosphere don't come here. This would be a good place for takeout."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem! They customize the menu to meet my vegan needs...
Highly recommend for Lunch and Dinner!"}
{"text":"Still ma favorite thai place. Currently obsessed with basil fried vegetable brown rice with no egg for my vegan self! YOU GOTTA TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, reasonable prices, fair portion sizes. This is probably our favorite hole in the wall Thai joint. The larb chicken has bits of bones ground up in it too - I'm not Thai so I don't know if this is how it is supposed to be, but be warned. We also usually get the pineapple fried rice and duck curry. Both of which are delicious. Definitely recommend coming here for a more casual Thai dining experience."}
{"text":"This used to be The King & I.   It sits in a small strip mall near Taco Bell and the DQ.  If I would have known this ahead of time I could have planned accordingly for a blizzard.

I placed a phone order for Crab Rangoon, Tom Yum Kung soup, Crab Fried Rice, and Chicken Panang Curry.

A little advice, and the reason they got 4 stars instead of 5... If you call and it sounds really busy in the background and the lady on the phone sounds rushed when she tells you 20 mins, you might want to take that time frame with with some mint chili and sit on it a little longer.  However, the service staff were really nice and offered me a drink while I waited.  They were nice and accommodating in spite of an old white impatient hag of a customer, about to blow her $5 wig for waiting too long, taking up all the limited counter space.  I think I saw the cheap glue melting off that weave

Anyways while the staff are all nice and accommodating, they do seem slightly inefficient, often partially cleaning a table, only to stop and finish something else that did not seem to be of immediate concern.  But I cant completely fault a mom and pop joint during the peak of an extremely busy dinner rush.

The Food:
The Crab Rangoon - Usually I have a complaint of not enough crab in the mix, from other places.  Here there was almost too much...the mix could have been a little lighter.  However, it was still really good.

Tom Yum Kung - I ordered this medium spice level, it was a little mild but delicious.  Each flavor ingredient comes through.  Good quality shrimp, but the tails still on.  I believe rice-straw mushrooms were used instead of the typical White Agaricus mushrooms.  The flavor balance is a little heavier on galangal and lime leaves than my ideal.  I still prefer a little more tomato in the mix than they do here.  But the soup was excellent regardless.

Crab Fried Rice - They give a lot!  The to-go container was heavy.  The flavor was a little subtle and light.  If this was all that you ordered it might be a bit bland.  However with a little of the Panang Curry, the light flavor was ideal 

Chicken Panang Curry - Usually I do not prefer coconut based curries, but decided to give it a try.  It was extremely good, smooth and not too strong in coconut flavor."}
{"text":"So I ordered  take out from here a year ago and I remember enjoying it, even though the portion sizes were a bit small.   Fast forward to today my guy and I are crazy starving and in this shopping center for other errands,  I decide we need to eat so we can think straight.  I pull it up on yelp and notice their ratings seem to have gone down.  I contemplated going somewhere else, but the hunger made my brain fuzzy, and I figured I had it before it should be fine.  

We walk in and only see one table of people,  although it's around 7 which is prime time for dinner.   I think maybe people just do take out here... I get the chicken satay since I had it last time and enjoyed it,  and the beef pad Thai.   I also decided to try the Thai ice tea. 

I bite into the satay, at first and my extreme hunger tells me it's OK... I bite into it a second time and the intensity of the salt hits me.  Mad crazy salty,  even my guy who likes salty things thinks it's salty.  I am to hungry to complain,  and I just eat it as my body slowly expands from water retention. 

The pad Thai has totally different noodles then I am accustomed to.  Not flat,  but closer to the shape and texture of spaghetti. It was not awful in flavor just basic, and forgettable. 

Thai iced tea was at at least solid, and helped to wash down the salt mine that had become my mouth from the chicken.   I then drank my entire glass of water trying to flush it out.   The taste still remained so I'm guessing it had a good does of msg as well.   

So yeah I'm just not feeling this place,  good thing there are many other options near by."}
{"text":"I'm adding Siri Thai to my list of usual Thai spots in the area. My visit here included great food great service.

I started with the Cucumber Salad. It was large enough for two to share and had a nice, sweet dressing on top. My husband and I shared Pineapple Fried Rice and the Pad Thai in Egg. Both of the dishes were tasty. I loved the slight sweetness of the Pineapple Fried Rice and it was full of goodies like cashews, pineapple, raisins, and vegetables. The shrimp didn't taste the best though I can't say anything was actually wrong with it. The Pad Thai in Egg had great flavor and I loved the ingredients. It was unique to have the dish wrapped in egg and is good for someone that can't get enough egg. I think next time I'd order the regular Pad Thai since that was my favorite part and the egg wrap seemed to decrease the portion size. 

The restaurant décor reminded me a bit of a grandma's house, but the restaurant was clean and comfortable. The restroom was clean as well. 

Our waitress checked in on us frequently and made sure we had full water glasses during our visit. Our food was prepared quickly."}
{"text":"Always come here for lunch. Food is good here. My favorites are papaya salad and yellow curry. Service is nice and restaurant decor is so pretty."}
{"text":"Panang is a favorite of mine no matter the place. I adore it sooooo much that I even learned how to make it myself.  

Of course I got my favorite dish. It was right on the money.  This gets 4 stars right off the bat for getting my favorite dish perfect.

Service was good. It was quick. Food was hot. Friendly was the server.

The atmosphere was nothing fancy but appropriate.  A clean, no frills little lunch time spot was just what I expected and experienced. 

Their menu and prices were good and typical.  

Spicy is what you expect for Taiwanese cuisine.  If you don't like spicy, get a burger or order the Chinese inspired items most of these places have on their menus to accommodate bland pallets.  Ordering a jalapeño dish but asking them to not make it spicy is silly.  So remember,  authentic foods should be prepared as that culture traditionally prepares them. If you don't like that regions \"spice\", get a Happy Meal."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for my friends and I traveling from Missouri. We were originally going to get Mexican (for taco Tuesday), but I'm so glad we made this choice. The restaurant had fresh food and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"So disappointed :( walked in - room was full of dirty dishes on every table and no one to clean them. Waited  a moment, as I though I may have walked in after a lunch rush and tried to give benefit of doubt. Not one person acknowledged us! Nope ! Walked right back out."}
{"text":"Ok, so after writing my first review, I told my boyfriend that I will not be giving them any business. But because he enjoys their food so much, he would just buy the meal every time we ordered from here. 

I'm not sure what happened, but I think either they hired new people or changed management because the lady that used to take orders is not there anymore (she was rude). Now that the staff seems to be more attentive and polite, I started going here again because their food is consistent and tasty. It's a good place to take takeouts from because usually, one order of curry lasts me two meals which saves money!"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, mediocre service. Ordered takeout and the woman handed me a menu and continued to look at her phone. Charges .50 on all debit/credit card transactions under $15.00. But I came here for the food, not the experience- overall, my dish was very tasty. Ordered Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Whoever is leaving this place 5 star reviews has either been paid or has literally never had good Thai food to compare it to.

This place was such a mess. Stopped in last night with some friends after work and we wanted to give it a shot, regardless of the mixed reviews. Should have stuck with my gut and gone to a better praised spot. The server was so cold, not a smile, took so long to come ask us what we wanted to drink (2 of us showed up 5 minutes after the first half of the group). Never asked us how the food was, when obviously it was bad - about 3/4 of what we left was barely touched. They didn't care. Must be used to people not liking things.

Every single thing was so piping hot and fast that it was painfully obvious it came out of a microwave. It's so sad that people own entire chef kitchens but use some 100 dollar machine to nuke your dishes. 

Our eggrolls tasted like the frozen kind from the Smiths across the street. Egg drop soup had that coagulated jelly all through it - 100% cold and reheated multiple times throughout the day (I know my leftovers). The most offensive part was when we asked for some limes to liven up our bland dishes, the server told me \"we don't have limes, only lemons.\"

So what you're saying is you are a Thai restaurant, but don't have lime? Why? How do you cook these Thai dishes without lime - a staple Thai ingredient? Please stop.

Biggest slap in the face was our $85 bill for 4. Had my wallet feeling like we just had some AYCE sushi. But we didn't, unfortunately.

Honestly there's so many other spots in the area you're willing to drive 3-5 minutes farther in any direction."}
{"text":"This is a little whole in the spot I ran into randomly and I absolutely love it so authentic the food is amazing !"}
{"text":"I love yellow curry and this place I think has one of the best!! Plus the food is always consistent and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Henderson! Delicious and always consistent. I've been here at-least ten times and have never been disappointed. Their soups and egg foo young are excellent. Fried rice very tasty! Their prices are reasonable as well. Try the lunch special too."}
{"text":"When they say hot, they mean it! I got the seafood green curry at a \"3\" and it was as much as I can handle while still enjoying my food. I skipped the rice, which probably had something to do with the heat.  I'll be back, but next time I'll just do a \"2\""}
{"text":"I love this place.
The food is excellent, and the quantities: plentiful without being too much.  Of course, their Pad Thai is good, as are their curries, and everything else I have tried.
The staff is very friendly.  The ambiance is nice.  They have deep booths, but provide pillows if you don't need to sit too far back.
Everyone I take here loves the place, even my friend who claimed to hate Thai food said this place made him rethink it."}
{"text":"I went here on a weeknight and we were the only people in the place, but someone had recommended it to us so we weren't too worried. Great food, but doesn't seem any different than all of the other Thai places in Vegas I've tried. We got the spring rolls, cucumber salad, tom kha with shrimp, tom yum without mushrooms, vegetable green curry, and combination pad thai. I ordered my curry at a level 3 on a scale of 1 to 5 and it was HOT! My friend got the pad thai at a level 4 and I didn't think it was spicy at all... maybe they mixed up the spice levels. Add some Singha and fortune cookies and it's an overall good meal. I'd go here if you live nearby, but don't venture too far out of your way. Staff was nice."}
{"text":"My new Chinese Food go to! The food is delicious. The waitresses are friendly and the portions are good size"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my work. The staff was pleasant, I think we might have gotten there a little later than they preferred but the experience was still good. The food was good, normal Thai food. Their scale is 1-5 with the 4 being a true 4."}
{"text":"This is a very small mom and pop restaurant located in a shopping center.  
We shared orders of Thai BBQ chicken and basil shrimp.  Both dishes were good, but I probably would not reorder the BBQ chicken as there are better versions available.  When I tendered my restaurant.com gift certificate, the waitress initially refused it, but the manager somewhat begrudgingly accepted it.  I subsequently learned they dropped out of the program."}
{"text":"Our favorite thai restaurant.  The food is delicious and the staff are super friendly.  This is a cute, quiet little restaurant.  Pricing is very reasonable and selection is great."}
{"text":"Great place to take the whole family. We showed up without warning-8 of us-and they accommodated us without blinking an eye. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We're just passin' through but stumbled into Siri on our first night (thanks to Yelp) and made a point of coming back on our last night here.  If you love Thai food, this is seriously delicious.  It's a family run, small, simple restaurant that's authentic, delicious, and very reasonably priced.  Portions are good sized to large. We had several currys, each excellent. You have a choice of how hot/spicy you would like and I found 2 (on a scale of 5) was very spicy.   Singha beer is a wonderful accompaniment.  We also had fried eggplant and spring rolls for appetizers - both highly recommended."}
{"text":"Their service sucks I order a tum yum soup and it was too sweet the waitress if she can bring me lemongrass to give it to sour taste that it lacked and she got mad and told me to GET OUT she didn't have an attitude at ask my friends if their food was fine I told her there food is good it was just my soup then she replied I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU! I was embarrassed and just left the place HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husbands mom is from Thailand and always makes me curry. I have yet to find a place that has anything similar, but low and behold I've sound it! Their spicy level goes to a five but I asked if if they could do a 7 and it was perfect. 

The only thing I ordered delivery and they charged
me the 3 dollars even thorough I live .6 miles away/"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, Imma bout to diss this place.

I have wanted to try this place for a while now, seeing how I love thai food and all. I tried it once a long time ago (meh), but I had heard of a menu change recently with new recipes and I was up for it again. I work as a nanny sometimes and I hit this place on the way to my clients house tonight. I did the take-out order and got my usual \"thai dish for chicks with weak pallettes\"....chicken cashew. I got to the clients house, and the whole time I was playing with the kids, watching Pocoyo, and changing dipeys, I was thinking and smelling my food in the kitchen. As I put the kids to bed tonight (their bedtime is 7p), I opened my long awaited meal.

Is this some kind of bad joke? Is it April Fool's day? Did a 4 star Yelp reviewed restaurant really put peanuts in my cashew chicken? I have only encountered such a agregious offense at one other place (see my review on Golden Gate Chinese). Peanuts are not cashews. In fact, they aren't even a suitable replacement for cashews. Peanuts are the court jester, cashews are the King. I had also asked for milder flavors and ended up with a take-out dish full of whole peppers. I couldn't eat it even if I picked out the lowly peanuts.

The lady was so nice when I came in to pay that I even tipped them on take-out food. I NEVER do that. If you enjoy Penn's Thai, Naga, or any other 4 star place-don't try this one. You will be disappointed. If a place is swapping peanuts for cashews in my dish, imagine what other corners are cut."}
{"text":"My go-to Thai restaurant previously had been Archi's on Rainbow and 215. After I discovered Siri Thai, no need to drive 15 minutes up 215 to get some quality Thai food. I drove by this place multiple times, but never went in because sometimes I'm skeptical of hole-in-the-wall places. But Siri Thai was a great find.

I always carryout, but they are always busy whenever I go to pick up my food. There are usually two ladies working, one older and one younger. They are both very friendly! The very first time I went there, the older lady brought out soup and salads for me while I was waiting for my order. When I went back, she hooked me up with a box of Thai coconut biscuits (?), and they were excellent.

So far, I have gotten Spicy Basil, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mow, Pad See Ew, and Garlic Pepper chicken. They were all great. You get to choose spiciness of your dish, from 1-3, and 3 in my opinion is not too bad. Their Pad Kee Mow was acutally one of the best version I've had so far. 

A small local restaurant with great food and kind people. Now I don't have to drive more than one block from my house for some quality Thai food!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place a lot.

1.  Service - Excellent. We were served by Julie, the daughter of the cook/ owner and she was very, very pleasant. She was always spot on with her recommendations and if she did not know something, she would simply tell us.  I enjoyed the service very much.

2.  Food - I liked the food here quite a bit.

We had the 

-Tom Yum Gai - Nice and spicy, we ordered this for two and had it very mild.

-Tom Yum Kung - Nice and perfectly spiced, we ordered this for another two to share and had it at a 4 / 5 spice and it was awesome. Just the right amount.

- Eggplant with ground pork - All I can say is usually I do not order eggplant and this was a very nice dish and the ground pork was the best part of it.

- Penang Curry - I just love curry and this was very nice. I could of just been happy with this.

-BBQ Short Ribs - A whole plate of ribs, Very tender and juicy. I found a bit too much sauce on it, kinda heavy, but what a great deal and good taste overall.

-Regular Rice - I find that having regular rice with all this stuff is the best way to absorb all the flavors.  It is simple and satisfying. 

3.  Come Back Factor - I liked it so much and so did the wifey, that we are going back soon.  We went with very good friends on our anniversary and had a great time being here.

GK says, check this place out!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a truly authentic Thai ambiance with food to back it up, this is the place.  I had just finished a round of golf with a friend and we decided to stop in for a bite.  Siri Thai has a very  warm, welcoming feeling when you walk in.  The waitress was very nice and took care of us immediately.

Being an avid Thai food lover I decided to order the Chicken Pad Thai 3/5 spice.  My friend loves spicy food and order the Pad Se Mao at 5/5 spice.  Our food arrived quickly and tasted great.  It had just the right amount of noodles and chicken, as well as garnish and nuts.

Being that I've been to Thailand many times, it's difficult to find a truly authentic feeling restaurant.  I'm happy to say Siri Thai fills that void.  I can't wait until the next time I'm on this side of town so I can sit down to another delicious meal.  Thanks Siri Thai!"}
{"text":"I've come here since I was a kid and it always tastes just as good . Each plate has enough food for about 2 people but I do wish they were bigger servings . Pad Thai is delicious and pad see ew never disappoints . I love the egg rolls and the hubby loves the chicken satay . Fried rice ? GET IT !! Best fried rice I've ever had  will continue to go here because of the location . In the future I'll add pictures  have never had any issues with service . They do speak their native language when having conversations to the side but it never bothers me"}
{"text":"I'd prefer to give it a 2.5 star rating.  While \"Meh, I've had better\" is absolutely true, so is the food being \"OK.\"

  I've been a fan of Thai food for about 25 years now, eating it a couple times a month, and frequently trying new Thai places as I search for the Thai restaurant that is able to prepare what I like with both great flavor, and spiciness.

 I ordered for the first time from Siri Thai a couple nights ago, via a smartphone app.   

I've started to find that for a take-out order costing over $20 or $30, Thai places start to give you a couple free egg rolls.    I've appreciated that, as they make for a good snack later on.  Siri Thai included the pre-packaged, plastic fork/knife & napkin kits, and one lowly packet of soy sauce, nothing else. * (see below)

  I ordered the same dishes I usually get from Thai places, and have been doing so for decades.

1. Mussamun Curry with tofu, special note \"I like it hot/spicy\"
2. Pad Thai with Noodle, with tofu
3. Basil Fried Rice, with tofu, special note \"No chilis please.\"

Each entree was about $10.

  Upon arriving at home, I decided my dinner would be the Basil Fried Rice & I'd consume the other two entrees the next day.   At this time, I discovered that the cheapskates at Siri Thai only provide a pint of steamed white rice along with the Mussamun Curry, instead of a quart of white rice like *most, if not ALL* other places have (dozens & dozens of Thai restaurants over the years).   This was very surprising, but only a minor nuisance, as I'd simply use my rice steamer to create more white rice the next day before mixing the rice & curry together & consuming it.

The Basil Fried Rice was \"OK,\" but part of the positivity there is due to me simply being very hungry.   The reality was that it didn't have much flavor to it at all, despite the menu stating \"Spicy Thai style friend rice, distinguished by flavor of minced garlic, fresh chilies, green beans and basil leaves. Spicy.\"     Yeah, I realize I ordered it without the chilies, however, that's how I've ordered it from other places, and Siri Thai's version just didn't have much flavor -- garlic could & should have provided a little bit of a spiciness 'kick,' but I didn't even really detect the garlic.

Next day, I microwaved the Pad Thai with noodle & tofu.   It was good, but not great.   For those desperate to disagree with *my* comments enough to claim that microwaving it changes the flavor, my response is OK, but Pad Thai from plenty of other places still has better flavor to it after being microwaved (so STFU...).    Did it put food into my belly & give me energy?  Yeah.

Finally for dinner that night, I steamed-up about a quart of white rice, re-heated the Mussamun Curry with Tofo, and mixed the two together into a big bowl for consumption.       Mussamun (aka Mussaman) Curry is the once dish in particular whose basic flavor profile I know well, and the dish that I really use to size-up a Thai restaurant.    It should have nuances of flavor to it plus have a spicy 'heat' or 'kick' to it.        Most Thai places seem to really be afraid to give us Americans much spiciness, even when we specifically ask for it.  They're probably worried our delicate bellies can't handle it, and we'll blame them for any gastrointestinal distress & give 'em a bad review for it.    That's why I did deliberately state \"I like it hot/spicy\" in the order notes section, though doing so at other places hasn't always resulted in getting what I'm looking for.     So I was hoping that even if it wasn't as spicy as I liked, it would at-least have the flavor nuances from the mixture of  Mussamun curry paste, coconut milk, peanut sauce, and onions...

  Obviously, mixing-in steamed rice dilutes some of the flavors.  I should have first sampled the Mussamun Curry by itself, and had I done-so, I would have discovered it somehow didn't have that great mix of flavors like I'd hoped, and thus would have mixed-in less rice (perhaps now I know why Siri Thai only provides a pint of steamed rice instead of the usual quart).    The \"spicy\" dish, which I'd told them \"I like it hot/spicy,\" had a minimal level of spiciness to it, as-if they had a scale of 1 - 10 with 10 being near-fatal, and 1 being so little spiciness, you couldn't even really call it a curry & that I ordered it at the 1 level.

* from above -- one other thing included in the takeout order bag was a small container of crushed, dried red pepper flakes.  I guess that was the response to \"I like it hot/spicy.\"   Pathetic.  I'm far from a chef, let-alone a chef specializing in Thai food, but I highly doubt that the spiciness in good Thai food, Mussamun Curry in-particular, comes from American or Mexican crushed red pepper flakes, though it could have been worse - one so-called Thai place simply dumped Siracha sauce into my curry.   It did have some flavor, but not a lot.

My search for a very good Thai place in the LV area continues..."}
{"text":"This place may look average, but the food is authentic.  Shrimp tom yum  was excellent. And green curry spicy and delicious. This place will be a regular"}
{"text":"VERY good.
their rangoons are AMAZING

let me tell you though, their spicy is VERY spicy so if you are not a spicy loving person, make sure you order something mild."}
{"text":"I wasn't repulsed but I wasn't impressed at all. Of the many times I've had Thai food, this was the worst. I ordered delivery for a family dinner we all could share. We got yellow curry which was so bland It hardly resembles curry. It was a watery flavorless soup. The Thai chicken salad was very tiny, ultra sweet with no spice. The cucumber salad was sickening sweet. The beef jerkey was flavorless. The beef and broc was dry and no flavor. The little juice in there was like a mild watered down broth. We had to load the food up with our own spices at home which only made it easier to swallow. We lost interest and ordered pizza. No one got sick or was disgusted but it was disappointing. I have never had Thai food that was lacking spice, flavor ect."}
{"text":"If its my first time at a restaurant I usually check yelp reviews, but this time I didn't because the friend I was with said she's been here before and liked it. (My Thai Food Adventure Friend -- we've been to almost all the Thai restaurants in the valley :) fun times) 

If I had seen the reviews especially the ones about the C rating and the demerits I would've not ate here. I hope by now they made the necessary changes. Damn straight I hope they did -- because now I'm wondering if they recycled the rice... 

We had the Pad Thai with Chicken and Panang Curry with Tofu. 

I LOVED the Pad Thai! It was flavorful and the right amount of sauce and a little greasier than other Pad Thais (which isn't bad at all, the greasiness worked well with this Pad Thai ). The noodles were thinner in width which I liked, which was different and made it a memorable Pad Thai. The spice levels are different compared to other Thai eateries, this one had a scale of 1-5. We asked for a 3. The spiciness was okay, at least for my taste buds, by the way ...I love spicy food! I should ask for a 4 or 5 next time.  Portion is okay, we were both hungry and got full quickly and we ended up with leftovers. Which is great in my book, I LOVE Thai Food! By the way...FYI We are not the girly type, we love food! We have pretty big appetites. 

The Panang Curry with tofu was good. The tofu slices were huge compared to other places but I wish there was more curry in it. I like to pour the curry over my rice. The curry was the main thing I was looking forward to since I haven't had Thai in a few months. 1 star less for \"not enough curry.\"

The overall ambiance of the place was clean, cute, with warm inviting authentic decor. It felt like we were eating at a relatives house. Oh, and what was unique and stood out to us was the comfy cushioned booths with PILLOWS. Uh... Do some people get a kanak attack (food coma -- in Hawaiian Pidgin) after eating here?! We almost did.

The price was okay, our bill was about $20, I expected it to be higher. Service was great, waitress was nice and helpful, we had no complaints. 

Ill be back again but only if I know they have a good A rating! I will keep an eye out from now on."}
{"text":"Called for take out: veggie chow mein, pork fried rice, orange chicken and fried wontons. It was all very delicious. The orange chicken was good although a little lacking on the sauce. The fries wontons so good. Idk what it is about fried wontons but I could get addicted to these. Good amount of filling, some places put such a tiny portion inside. Overall was good food and will hit this place up again."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the take out service of Siri Thai, but what I experienced was pretty good.  

The food (I ordered tofu pad thai) was amazing.  The service was...awkward.  Before I left the restaurant the woman bringing my food out from the kitchen looked at me and then said something in Thai to the young woman who was ringing my order up at the register.  The two women laughed out loud and I can't help but feel like it was at my expense.  Not the best etiquette but the food and Thai tea were delicious."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars, overall good service, fast when it came to delivery of the food. Flavors were clean and fresh - basil chicken was very good. In general, very good Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food!  We got our comfort favorites for our first visit, Thai beef salad, orange chicken and egg rolls.  The food was delicious.  I can't wait to go back and try more dishes.  The atmosphere is quaint and inviting. The booths are very comfortable with pillows.  The only reason I am not giving them a 5 is because they did not bring fresh plates between courses so my rice soaked up salad dressing which was a bit off putting.  Other than that, fantastic.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch and it was busy. I am retired so I am not in a hurry. One waitress, no greeting, 40 to possibly 50 seats. I wait too long for a menu and then too much longer for \"the\" waitress to 'not take' my order as a man walks in and she takes his order immediately. I ask her is he a regular or perhaps he is picking up a to-go. She says no she is overwhelmed and apologizes. I accept. Food drags out of the kitchen but no problem. Did I say I was retired?! I order 6 apps so I can take home and nibble the rest later. Fish cakes were cooked in old grease and the stuffed chicken wings were fried in fish grease. Did I say I owned a restaurant in the past....No bueno!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant remains a hidden gem in a Henderson strip mall beside a Dairy Queen and a popular Sushi Bar. The service here is warm and welcoming (they are actually Thai!). The food is delicious! I make it a point try the same menu items in most Thai places. One, because I love these Thai cuisines. Two, so I can draw a good comparison. The Tom Kha is one of these examples - which was FANTASTIC. Even the fancy clay serving pot was amazing. I had the Beef Jerky, which was delicious, not tough or stringy. I tried the crab rangoons which was delicious, flavorful, and the best Ive tried so far. The pad Thai was delicious, flavorful, and one of the highlights.  
We decided to try a dessert or should I say desserts.  We tried the Roti with Coconut Ice Cream and the Mango Rice. All were DELICIOUS! What a great way to end this fantastic experience. The Thai Tea was great also. 

We have come back here several times since!"}
{"text":"A little overpriced but the food is fresh. It's hard to find a good Thai food place and this place isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Let's make this simple. Here is what u need to order here:
1. Soup = Tom yum or Tom kha shrimp.
2. Salad =Thai beef/chicken salad, larb, nam sod and my vegetarian favorite papaya salad. You pick there all good.
3. Main course. = kana moo grob or crispy pork (same thing). This dish hands down is my favorite. The basil dish, garlic pepper and ginger am dish are good also.
4. Curries= your choice. Your tastebuds.
5. Drinks = young coconut and/or Thai tea/coffee.
6. Desert = hands down coconut ice cream. If that doesn't do it for u then sweet Roti."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a whim. So glad we did because the food was amazing. We ordered the egg wrapped pad Thai and it was seriously one of the best pad Thai's I have ever had. We also ordered the garlic and pepper chicken and shrimp fried rice. Both also really good. We'll definitely be making this place our regular spot from now on."}
{"text":"The food seems fresh, when dinning in it could be a hit and miss on service, with it a 60%~40% on the hit and miss.

Take out is always consistent and the spice level for dinner is always hotter then lunch, there is different cooks at night.

We enjoy take out, they do deliver, for a charge."}
{"text":"What can I say... Moving in slow motion today after concerts two nights in a row. Was not in the mood to cook let alone actually setting foot outside of the house. Found Siri Thai thanks to my fellow helpers. I was obviously famished because I way over ordered. Tom Kha was pretty solid as was the papaya salad and beef pad see ew. The duck panang, however, didn't have that beautiful creamy and luxurious sauce that I love. Also, the crispy pork basil was pretty fatty and not rendered down. I was really looking forward to the crab fried rice but it was really salty and an overly fishy taste. A nice touch was that they threw in a box of vanilla wafers. I thought initially that it was instead of fortune cookies but when I opened the bag I saw those had been included. Reasonable price and pretty huge portions. I will be enjoying leftovers all week. I will for sure order for delivery again at some point."}
{"text":"Awesomeness on my plate. This is the best Thai food I have had since moving out of San Francisco."}
{"text":"Siri Thai is a small Thai restaurant in the strip mall on the southwest corner of Windmill and Pecos that has consistently provided good meals for my family. The restaurant is small but we've never had to wait to be seated no matter what time we arrive. The family that runs the restaurant, although usually providing non-engaging, robotic service, has always been kind to us.

There's probably about ten tables in the restaurant with booths along the wall that have pillows which is an interesting touch. Two women usually run the front of the house and they usually get the job done as far as service.

On this visit, we ordered Thai beef jerkey, egg drop soup, tom yum soup with shrimp (spice- 3/5), papaya salad (spice-3/5), the basil crispy pork (spice- 4/5), and mango ice cream sticky rice for dessert. We had no problems with the food and the heat levels were just right for us. My wife likes papaya salad and she thinks Siri's version is one of the better ones. The tom yum soup had a nice sour kick with plenty of large mushrooms and tomatoes. Dessert was a nice surprise for us. Being Filipino, I can eat rice with just about anything, but have never had it with ice cream. This is something I'm going to have to do more often. The warm, sweet rice with cold, tart ice cream was combination that had us finishing the dessert in less than 5 minutes.

Although the food is always consistent, it doesn't separate or elevate above other Thai restaurants in the area. I'm still a fan and it will always be an option for us when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I've ever had. Visiting family in town and decided to stop there. Papaya salad was too salty, sent it back and they just mixed in bottled lime juice. They don't use fresh lime because I asked for additional lime and it was juice in a small bowl. The lady claimed the \"dressing\" for papaya salad was made to salty meaning it is not made fresh to order. Sticky rice wasn't cooked all the way, hard uncooked rice in the middle. Charged an extra $1 for beef laarb to only be served ground beef with crunchy rice (the rice powder wasn't ground). Pad Thai was nothing but just sweet, not savory and delicious. Save your money folks. Nice people but food sucks"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious I went back the very next day and ordered again. 

The first time I ordered Spicy chili mint noodles, cucumber salad and Roti. I had no idea what roti was...WOW. Everything was fantastic. I always end up screwing around when I bring home food, so I usually have to reheat whatever I get to go, but this was still hot even after my wandering around trying to clean the house a bit before eating. The cucumber salad was like the onion cucumber salad I make at home and keep in the fridge but a bit sweeter, I wonder how they did that? :) 

And the roti was like a sweet delicious pancakey, flaky, sweet thing that I warmed up and put ice cream on. Mmmmmmmmmm!!!

The next night I ordered a Pad thai and Kra pow with chicken ( I wanted to assure I had leftovers for the next day since I was off. ;)  )  And I was blown away. Some of the best pad thai I have ever had, and the Kra pow was phenomenal. 

I saw there swollen and full to the gills looking at the take out boxes with remorse that I did not have another stomach to fill, then brightened when I realized I was going to have it tomorrow as well! Yay!  

So even after three days together, Siri thai and I were happy. Its my day off again...I may have to go again. ;)"}
{"text":"I order takeout from here once in a while and have never had a major complaint. Sometimes it's better than others but overall good. I believe the spice level is 1-5 and in my opinion is a little on the spicy side, so keep that in mind or be sure to specify exactly how spicy you want it."}
{"text":"I'm a Thai guy. I love going here because it's so close. The food is dumbed down a little bit to fit the American palate but the pad Thai is good. The ingredients are fresh. I give this place five stars because I want this place to stay in business forever."}
{"text":"It's good. Kinda spicy but now i know to order 1 for spicy! Dessert was good too. I'll be back for more"}
{"text":"Family owned Mom & Pop store with authentic Thai Chinese cuisine. I have never had anything that disappointed! Tom Ka soup is of high quality, so are the fresh coconuts and all the meats and veggies used. 
They don't use heavy oils like they do at Lotus of Siam - so better for my sensitive stomache"}
{"text":"This is the best spot in our neighborhood! Everyone is always friendly, accommodating, and happy to have my business. My favorite is the Chicken Pad Thai and Crab Rangoon. Oh and you must try an iced coffee!"}
{"text":"Too spicy..
Ordered the Tom Khai soup with chicken, which was very good. However our main dish was the Massaman Curry and we requested a 1.5 out of 5 on spice level. When we received the dish and took a few bites, it seemed a bit too much. My boyfriend and I kept eating it but unfortunately the more bites we took the worse the spiciness got!! By the end of the meal I was feeling sick. My boyfriend told the waitress about the issue and she was happy to add some non-splcy sauce to dilute the dish but for me it was too late. Just BEWARE of spice level here if you are not a fan or are sensitive like me :) Otherwise it was good!"}
{"text":"I will be back!

 Excellent service, excellent food. Had the Tom Yum soup and the Spicy Chicken. I did order both spicy, next time I will order medium. I would order either again and am looking forward to trying thier other dishes. Siri Thai is added to my favorites for dining. Prices  here are fair and service is quick."}
{"text":"We have been eating at another Thai restaurant for the last year but the quality has suffered a bit lately so we decided to try a new Thai restaurant.   Based on reviews we decided upon Siri.  Some of it was fabulous and some of it, not so much. 

Liked: Crab rangoon and I had a mango (i think) salad.  It was very good!  The portion size is awesome (enough to have as lunch the next day).  Prices are very reasonable.

Didn't love: My vegetable pad thai and the kids didn't really like the orange chicken or sweet and sour chicken.  

Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Close by and delicious dishes. 

Had the boneless stuff chicken wings, Drunken noodle, and garlic pepper chicken. 

It's not really crowded all three times that I've gone there, which is a shame because their dishes are flavorful and sauces are right on par with what I would expect from a Thai Restaurant."}
{"text":"Not good business practise when you tell me you are closed when I call at 9:19pm!!! Just wanted some soup to pick up since I'm feeling sick.  But I was told they are already cleaning the kitchen.  This is at 9:19 pm! For a business that posts their hours open until 930! I work at a restaurant that posts their closing time at 11:00pm. That means you get your order in before 11!! Not 10:49! Bad business habit"}
{"text":"Heart-shaped rice. Too freaking adorable!

I came here with the fabulous Jaime W for lunch last week and we had a great meal, mostly due to the company not the food. We came around 12:45 and the place was packed. We were lucky to be able to get the last booth available. They have a pretty large lunch selection and you can add a Thai iced tea for just another $1.25. What a deal. I decided on the basil chicken and it was pretty tasty. Not as spicy as I was hoping when I asked for 4 out of 5 so I'll probably have to ask for a little spicier next time. The sauce was more sweet than spicy, so I'd be curious to try some of their other dishes to see if I like anything a little better. The Thai tea was pretty good as well. The cutest thing on the plate was the heart-shaped rice. You heard me right. Too cute.

Service was pleasant and efficient considering how busy they were. Portions were ok. Small, but on par with other Thai lunch specials I've had in town. I'm definitely interested in giving them another try and maybe try some of their other specialty dishes, oh as well as that dessert roti I saw on the menu."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food ever. Went twice and ordered curry and pad Thai. I gave this place a second chance but regretted it. Either it's undercooked or overlooked food, oily, wet lettuce in the salad, bland soup. Not going back ever again. Food is bad and decor is ugly. My favorite Thai place is Thai St Cafe!!!! Would give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Overall happy with the meal and service for my first visit.  I eat a lot of Thai so not 5 stars in comparison.  For a local lunch spot though, definitely a place to return to.  
I discovered the lunch specials in the back of the menu so went with Red Curry.  Came with a SMALL salad, soup, rice, mini-fried spring roll, and the dish...all for just $6.95!  Great ingredients and flavor but I'm a portions guy and the main course was in a small bowl, so would have preferred a bit bigger.  But still, for the price I can't complain.  Asked for 4 out of 5 on spice and at first seemed like they gave me a 2, but once I got to the bottom, I found all the heat. So be sure to mix your dish up if you like it to burn like I do!
Anyway, overall not a Must Eat, but if you're in the area and can't decide, they're worth a stop...you won't be disappointed.
Had to amend my review with a final note. Upon close out, I was both impressed and let down at the same time.  The small touch of watermelon slices was very nice.  But was then informed there's a minimum charge if you have credit card, so because I didn't have cash, they added a charge fee to my bill.  Come on, really?"}
