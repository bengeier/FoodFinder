{"text":"Eager to see what would happen with this place after Bellini's closed in this location. Hail Mary's owners' Tiki Shack went away, which was a little sad for us, so we had to check their new venture out on a Friday night. It was nice to get to this calmer place after several jam-packed bars nearer to the Square. The staff were very personable and friendly and the drinks and apps we had were good. The menu was themed creatively which I appreciated too! Seemed like they could use a few more tables in there? Just seemed a little empty on the main floor."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night for my friends birthday. Awesome atmosphere and super accommodating staff. We ordered nachos, potato skins, and other apps ( not overly fried) and they were all awesome. Great drinks and can't wait to host a party here. Such an awesome place."}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs! Love all the staff. Super fun place"}
{"text":"Had a great time with family at this cool place. We had fried chicken sandwich, BBQ chicken flatbread and burger sliders. Everything was great including the cheese curd appetizers. Oh an the drinks were great too. I had the margarita with fresh squeezed limes and it was totally refreshing on this hot summer day. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it's our first and last time. Holy Daly cocktail party as tasteless water. Waste of 6 bucks. The cheese curds were a glob of grease. Seriously, it's Sunday afternoon and no one is here. You could try....or not."}
{"text":"We are from South Florida and were in Madison for a week for a competition. We ended up at Hail Mary one night, frankly because there was no wait. We were so happy that we did! The ambience is really unique, our waitress Erin was a real pleasure and the food was amazing! We had the cheese curds (the best one we had all week and we tried them everywhere we went), the House burger, wings, and the pulled pork samdwich. Everything was fabulous. Would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I am so confused by what this place is supposed to be, a sports bar or a college dive bar. In a residential neighborhood off the square with mixed families and professionals.  Not the college aged patrons they seem to want to attract.  Regardless their problems and faults are to many to be forgiven.  We came in for the Sunday Night Packers game thinking it would be a well attended, only ten other people were there.    Our waitress was pleasant but wreaked of pot, asked for our drink order....this did not go well as the first three beers we asked for were out.  As we ordered food again the kitchen was out of sour cream for our nachos because the night before was busy. ***  Go buy some at the festival foods.   Their problems started to become my problems as the waitress complained.  The place was dingy and the bathrooms need serious  cleaning.  The space and the concept just do not mesh.    Here is the only redeeming feature the food was really good.   I had the fried chicken sandwich which was excellently cooked,moist, nice breading but could have a bit more hot sauce. My friends burger came out beautifully cooked to temp.  The fries were ok.    Go elsewhere either on the Square or anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not completely sure I understand all of the five star reviews but this bar sure has potential. We ordered the fish fry which was ok... and expensive. We also got the buffalo chicken salad. Now that was delicious! The margarita I got was very very weak and honestly just tasted like something from a pre mixed bottle.   Now in terms of atmosphere, Hail Mary has that in spades. Pretty sweet to watch sports games in old church. I don't like the high tables as much or the tile floor but the open space and stained glass is just too cool.  I'm sure I'll be back but I may just stick to the buffalo chicken salad."}
{"text":"Been there for game watches mostly, they allow us Hawkeye fans to take over on game days!  Always good drink specials, only done snacky food so far but all very good.  Parking right across street in city lot real convenient!  Service super - gal with short white hair is awesome and fun.  Plenty of TVs.  One warning...you have to go downstairs for bathrooms and the path goes right in front of dart players!  LOOK OUT!"}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to like this sports bar!!! The revamping of an old church is such a cool idea!! And the outdoor seating is really nice and fairly picturesque! But....once inside, it's loud, plain and just dull. I found that my group of three had to shout across the small pub table and the tv's were really too small. The service was really lacking and slow, maybe the server was new??? However, I need to say that Dude Server was really nice and did admit that one dinner order was forgotten, therefore, it was going to be comped. Sweet! Sadly, the Beer Battered Perch was really mediocre at best and the beer menu was lacking. The best part about this Sports Grill is their clever menu listing: Invocation (apps), Scripture (sandwiches), Sermon (flatbreads), Benediction (soup/salad), etc! How is that not just plain fun??!!!"}
{"text":"The food was so amazing, and the service was even better!! It was all around one of the best experiences I have ever had. The bartender was so friendly and welcoming and he was very attentive. This place made me feel so at home. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This could be a 5 star review if you brought back the strawberry stuff from Tiki Shack for strawberry vodka lemonades. You would also have more regulars. That stuff was the best."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this new Madison restaurant. Wonderful spicy Bloody Mary, great burgers and cool ambiance."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood bar. Personable staff, fun ascetic, and great food! Really excited to come watch Packer games here!  Thank you Pierce!"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open - to see what they did to the inside.  I was a fan of Bellini's, mainly for the atmosphere, so I was really hoping they hadn't ruined it.  The place looks great - really open and inviting.  Loved the industrial lighting they had scattered about and they didn't bombard the walls with décor, which would've taken away from the beautiful stained-glass windows. They installed quite a few TV's but they were placed really well, it didn't feel obnoxious like some sports bars.   We were the only ones at the bar and there was only one other group there.  I believe the bartender said they just opened so I'm assuming the word hasn't gotten out.  They should consider putting some sort of sign out front or in the window signaling they're open.  Their 'Hail Mary' awning isn't enough to show it's a new place, or that they're open.  The bartender was super friendly and accommodating - she had a great, energetic personality.  We ordered the fried green beans which I thought were good but could use 1/2 the amount of batter.  Also ordered the Greek flatbread and that was amazing.  Generous on the goat cheese and olives, perfect crust.  Drinks were a good pour too =)  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!! Great food, awesome atmosphere and the staff is super friendly. My fiancé and I hosted our bachelor/bachelorette dinner here and they were so accommodating! They put multiple tables together for all of us (over 40 people) and brought out the yummiest food that everyone enjoyed! The inside is super awesome and doesn't feel old at all! Very unique! If you're looking for a fun time and great food, GO HERE! Looking forward to watching and celebrating many Packer and Badger games here in the fall!"}
{"text":"This place sucks the service was bad. It's so disorganized. A bunch of guys running around and don't know what to do."}
{"text":"This place rocks, it's definitely our new go-to for sporting events! Food is amazing, as are the drinks. Lots of specials and delicious cocktails in addition to the usual beer fare you would expect from a sports bar. We've had their cheese curds, nachos, pizza and wings so far, all were a total knockout. Great use of the old Bellini's space,   Also love that the downstairs is set up with it's own bar (Tiny Tiki Shack!) and lots of games, darts, Golden Tee, etc, to keep everyone entertained at half-time. We will definitely be regulars here and hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"I tried the fish fry and a buffalo chicken salad. The fish fry was mediocre, but the salad was above average as bar food goes. The basement looked pretty cool with some bar games down there, but it was closed off during my visit. The TV's were a bit high/far away from a good portion of the seats, the baseball game was still watchable though. Lots of space and the pews are fun. I'd like to try the patio on a nice day."}
