{"text":"Trendy new Toronto hot spot where the Saint Tavern used to be.   The decor was on point as well as the music selection. There is a cool casual vibe and good energy.   In terms of the food, we ordered the whole scallops to start. They were beautifully arranged on a shell and drizzled with a delicious sauce. Very fresh and definitely tasted like the sea. I would recommend. Next was the albacore tuna - this was four large pieces of tuna (seared?) and covered with a caper heavy sauce. I love capers so I enjoyed this as well.   In terms of mains, the eurobass en croute did not disappoint. The fish was tender and delicious. I was disappointed I couldn't eat the salt pastry that was wrapped around it. The flatiron was good but not amazing. I was impressed with the pommes anna that came with it. The pommes aligot was also very delicious. We had a lot of potatoes.    Finally, the disco egg was worth it. I think $50 is a bit ridiculous but I don't get many chances to crush a beautiful chocolate egg so I'm ok with the decision. It's way too much chocolate for two people to eat, but it was more for the spectacle than for the actual dessert. We took the rest of the truffles and chocolate home. I think the restaurant is also getting a lot of social media hits for it and I'm guilty as charged.    My only complaint is with regards to the service. This would otherwise have been a four star review. For the price we paid, I would've expected more attentive service and I'm far from a demanding diner. For the most part, I like to be left alone to enjoy the meal. However, it often felt our waiter was nowhere to be found. He also wasn't very helpful answering our questions, and he was impossible to find when we wanted our check. Not to mention we had to find our coats ourselves as we were leaving. These are simple things you would expect when paying $100+++ per person but I guess that's a simple thing to improve."}
{"text":"La Banane was highly recommended by a friend, and it did not disappoint! I was looking forward to the seafood and trying other dishes.  But, I was really on a mission to get the Ziggy Stardust Disco Egg :) That was the highlight of the meal.  I didn't read beforehand, what it was made of and what was in it, as I love surprises.  Cracking it open to a burst of chocolate truffles inside was everything! it also contained dried cherries and some other chocolatey goodness that resembled chunks of Aero chocolate.  The price is steep at $50 for one dessert, but it was a lot of fun, great quality ingredients, it was artfully painted, and apparently each component was handmade and took three days to prepare.  No two eggs are painted the same, so I am definitely going back for more.  Let's get to the food.  We ordered the petite plateaux, a 3 tiered platter of an assortment of seafood.  The top tier contained sliced raw scallops in garlic buttermilk served on a scallop shell - the texture and flavour not a fave for me, but my date liked it. The second tier had Argentenian shrimp which was lovely and sweet.  At the base are dungeness crab, Alaskan King Crab, lobster, lucky lime and strawberry point oysters, and marinated mussels. The dungeness, king crab, and lobster was just ok for me, a little on the dry side, but the mussels were plump and tasty, and the oysters were really fresh.  The platter was accompanied by several sauces/dips: tarragon mayo, cocktail sauce, hot sauce, a mignonette, Crème fraîche, and butter.  We also ordered sweetbreads and pommes aligot.  FYI, sweetbread is a fish, which was smoked and served atop a shrimp and lobster sauce, which I found a little salty, but still good.  The sweetbread had a nice light coating on the outside and soft on the inside.  The pommes aligot is to die for; a rich, creamy potato puree with cheese, and it paired really well with the sweetbreads.  This was a recommended pairing by the very polite and knowledgeable server.  Every time a dish was brought out, the servers recited the ingredients, which was much appreciated.  They had an extensive drink menu of which we tried  the Charlie Chaplin (gin, apricot liquor and lime) and a couple of whiskies, Elijah Craig and Buffalo Trace.  All were smooth and yummy.  $300 later, we were left full and happy.  Looking forward to another experience there."}
{"text":"Nice dinner last night. The oysters were extremely fresh and delicious. The duck fat pretzel bread was lovely although a tad salty. My friend and I shared the duck breast and the crab dish - both were good. The dessert menu left us wanting, although we did share the lemon crepe/ curd and it was nice.  As for the wait staff, they were friendly although I can't stand it when they say \"how are we doing tonight? And calling us his \"friends\". I teased him about it and he seemed to take it in stride.  They've got that unfortunate problem that many restaurants along that strip have which is that the basement is extremely damp and smells like sewage.  That being said, I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Good food...but nothing exceptional or notable that would make someone absolutely want to return. Service...a hit and miss. Some servers were great...others lacking in basic service like filling water glasses and topping up wine."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing dinner I had last night. The food was just incredible and top notch quality, and so too was the service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good.  Stylish, elegant, hip, whatever.  The kind of décor where rich people feel comfortable and people like me roll their eyes in judgment at the pretention.  It's not a huge departure from when it was The Saint and I am exaggerating for dramatic effect.  It's nicely decorated; pretty much the polar opposite of Montgomery's down the street.  They hung a rug on a wall at Montgomery's.  I will never go back to a place that can't get that right. Rugs go on the floor people.  Anyway the service is excellent.  The drinks list very good; a really nice selection of beer was on offer, though they had nothing on tap.  So far so good.  But the food was just okay for me.  The omelette was delicious but for $15 it had better be you know?  But nothing else really did it for me or lived up to the promise that a price tag makes--if you're charging $28 for a duck leg on veg it had better be life affirming and call you back the next day.  But if you're poor like me you probably feel the same way I feel when I order a Big Mac.  Like it's no big deal.  It didn't cost a lot, relatively speaking.  I didn't spend a lot.  It tasted okay.  Life goes on...  Can we talk about the three cheese plate for a minute? It was really underthought.  They don't serve it with anything.  It was just three pieces of cheese lying naked, exposed, and vulnerable on a plain white plate.  There were no crackers.  No bread.  Neither honey, fruit, figs, jam, nor jelly were there to lend a hand.  Instead they upcharge for their brioche which they are only too happy to repeat to every table and probably every random person walking up Ossington who passes the door, is made daily in house.    Overall this is a good place and I knew it was pricey going in so it seems wrong to complain but you can't help what you're good at.  Probably if you like The Chase or Canoe you'll like it here.  Above average food with awesome service and drinks in an atmosphere where you can feel like you made it.  The disco egg is ridiculous."}
{"text":"We had planned a date night, for La Banane, to treat ourselves to a well rated new restaurant. Lucky for us we we slow to order, none of the mains jumped out at us, which is rare. We began with the soft shell crab, that was no better than CNE-level fare. I couldn't taste the crab, just deep-fried with some thousand island dressing to mask it! I didn't bother finishing it. We immediately came up with an excuse and left. Disappointment? Oui!    Don't fall for \"La Banane in the tail-pipe-hype!\""}
{"text":"one of the best new restaurants in toronto - a definite must.  we had the oysters, albacore tuna, lobster sweatbread (special), eurobass and disco egg for desert.  the entire experience from wait staff, atmosphere and culinary experience was superb.   All of the dishes were worthy of ordering again, but specifically the euro bass is a must try.  we will definitely be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"So this place was great. Seafood was meaty and plentiful, ambiance was great and they were extremely accommodating.  We had king crab, mussels, tuna, duck, signature fish and the cheesy cheesy mashed potatoes and the egg! It was a perfect spot for birthday fun. Our waiter was also pretty awesome and surprised us with a complimentary glass of wine while we were waiting for a new dish to be prepared. Overall, will go back as soon as I can get a reservation and will likely order seafood, tuna and the duck and will try out one of the other desserts (because having a $50 chocolate egg is a little excessive - but worth it if you haven't tried it)."}
{"text":"What an extraordinare evening. This was one of the most enjoyable evenings I have had in a long time. The food was outstanding, the service the most attentive yet friendly service I have ever had.  Kate is extraordinaire by helping with a special request. Olivia followed suit be seemlessly integrating a vegetarian. Both made our entire group feel special and welcomed. These ladies made every guest feel special and I salute them.  Keep it up... I'll be back. *****"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9.5/10 Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Service: 10/10  Going bananas for La Banane. Tried this new Ossington joint approximately 1 month after it had opened and it was void of any new restaurant woes. While it is on the pricier side, you get your value from excellent food, extremely attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly service, and hip atmosphere. What more could you ask for?  The food was great, and our server provided well thought out recommendations on what to pair with what, and the order in which we should enjoy the meal. It really helped create the experience. Started with cold seafood (mussles and king crab), cheese course (with complimentary brioche), eurobass en croute (the zig zag fish you see in all of the pics) with pommes aligot (essentially cheesy mashed potatoes - YUM), finishing off with duck confit and the frisee salad.   Cocktails were concocted well. There was a bit of a mixup when the wrong beer was ordered (mistakingly interpreted as the $36 one...) but was quickly resolved with no hesitation. Our server took it off our bill - no questions asked.   Aside from the above, it is a place you just WANT to eat at. Plush seats, a bar stretching across the length of the restaurant... it's intimate, trendy, Ossington-esque.  THE BOTTOM LINE: great food, great atmosphere, and even greater service rounding out a fantastic experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated but still mostly decent. I initially went here to try the chocolate egg and went for dinner with a friend. She had the omelette which she said was good but not great. I had the fried chicken, also good but not great. The chocolate egg was really great but really expensive for the minimal amount you get."}
{"text":"La Banane is an excellent French restaurant at Ossington and Dundas.  The decor and atmosphere is tasteful with a subtle french sophistication. The service was excellent with very knowledgable staff. The dining room was cozy and even the downstairs stone foundation was kept on the theme. The lighting is dim and the booths are very cozy.  For me, the food provided a balance between the artisan French style and the comfort of warm rich foods with mid size quantities.   Make a reservation so you have a seat. Arrive early to find street parking. The area is busy and parking is scarce. No patio unfortunately.   Most Items are sharable, so bring friends and order multiple items. The Disco Egg is a work of art that can be adored for hours.  My Recommendations: Scallops - Garlic Buttermilk Albacore Tuna - Brown Butter, Dill, Capers Flat Iron Steak - Pommes Anna, Sauce Soubise Ziggy Stardust Disco Egg - Hand Painted Chocolate Truffle Egg (Order this right when you sit to ensure its availability and enough preparation time)  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Fabulous addition to the Toronto culinary scene! Hubby brought me here for our anniversary. Excellent quality food (though a bit too salty) surprisingly generous portions and great service.  We started with the FOIE GRAS: as good as Paris!! A melt-in-your-mouth slice of Heaven served with light-as-air toasted brioche and subtly-sweet poached apple. The VEAL TARTAR was the weakest dish of the eve (not as tender as expected and a bit too heavy on the mustard but nothing to complain about). Both portions were big enough to share.   For mains, I had the famous EUROBASS EN CROÛTE which was every bit as delicious as advertised. So rare to find a restaurant that serves perfectly cooked fish. Will definitely be back for this again.  Hubby had the HERITAGE CHICKEN feature: unbelievaby tender & juicy. I still can't believe half the dish was white meat! We shared the BIBB LETTUCE SALAD which was perfect accompaniment - light and refreshing.  We were so stuffed, I couldn't finish my main and even the thought of dessert was impossible. A small tragedy as we really wanted to try the Ziggy Stardust Egg :'(  The only odd thing about this restaurant is the paper table covers. But will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu, especially one of the seafood platters."}
{"text":"I was super hyped to try this place and finally did yesterday. First, the service..it was friendly, prompt and very attentive...so this is a plus!  We ordered Scallops in buttermilk sauce, shrimp and a cheese plate... and they brought out the pretzel bread for apps. Besides the cheese plate, I wasn't overly wow'd. The scallops in the buttermilk sauce had a weird briny taste that I couldn't get past.  For the mains, we had eurobass en croute, pommes aligot, duck with charred endive and the salmon dish. My fave here was the pommes aligot...delicious cheesy, garlicy and buttery if you eat it warm...it doesn't sit well though. Everything else was ok...i was expecting to be floored by the eurobass and duck...and honestly, it was a bit bland.   Our desert was the ziggystardust disco egg...all hype here. The few truffles inside the egg was yummy...but for $50, it's a bit steep and not worth it!  We also had 2 $65 bottles of wine.  Now for the bill...this is definitely not in your average price range...the bill was a whooping $500+ ...i wanted to be wow'd for the price. And I just wasn't... glad we tried it but I likely won't go back. Chantecler in the same neighbourhood had way better food with a french flair and flavors within a decent price range."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here. Dirty Martinis were awesome. Great seafood. And the Banana cake....awemazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this restaurant except their seafood platter. I'm still thinking of the shrimp. Sweet and so fresh. Awesome!  I have to admit the service was impeccable. I would rate the service 5 star, unlike the food. Entrees we ordered the duck breast, eurobass, crab shell and sweetbread. DO NOT ORDER THE SWEETBREAD. Awful taste. So awful there's no way of describing it. The duck breast was moist and good. The crab shell was baked and decent. The eurobass was overhyped for sure. Also order the fois gras... it was not bad.   At the end, since everyone said you should order the Chocolate Egg ($50) we did. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! We were told it takes 2 days to make and I was expecting a big surprise when you open it. NOPE! All you get inside are 2-3 chocolate balls. THAT'S IT!!! LOL You'd rather buy some Godiva chocolates from a supermarket and save yourself that $50.  Decent food but great service. Another over-hyped restaurant from Yelpers."}
{"text":"4.5 stars As a fan of culinary shows like Chef's Table, La Banane was the closest restaurant where I have experienced 'fine dining.' My uncle treated my father and I to a last-minute dinner in Toronto and I chose this restaurant due to all the reviews and Toronto blog posts I've seen online.  I booked a reservation for 9:15 PM and we arrived 15-20 late due to traffic. Even though we showed up late, upon my surprise, our table was still ready and reserved for us upon our arrival. As well, since we decided to go here last minute, we weren't really wearing \"dressy\" attire as I read that was the restaurant's dress code. I was worried that we wouldn't be served for some reason or would get some weird looks, but the staff treated us very nicely and politely  Our party of three split: - Prezel-type of bread with mustard (house bread) - King crab - Raw marinated scallops with garlic buttermilk - *Foie gras with brioche, raspberry compote and toasted hazelnuts - *Charred broccolini - *Duck terrine - Rib steak  - Complimentary chocolates  Unfortunately, their popular eurobass en croute and steelhead trout were sold out. I know La Banane is known for their seafood and raw bar, but I would forgo the crab and scallops next time I go. They were good, but nothing too spectacular in my opinion.  The duck was cooked wonderfully - shaved and placed back on the bone for ease of eating and wrapped beautifully in a puff pastry that wasn't too thick and didn't overpower the meat. The broccolini was a wonderful addition to go with the meat and I don't usually love eating vegetables, especially when eating out. My favourite by far was the foie gras. On the menu, we received it said it had apricot or some other sauce with it, but our waiter informed us that it was actually raspberry. The meat was smooth, fatty (but not gross fat), and melted in your mouth. I had some of the meat on its own and the other half on my brioche with the compote and hazelnuts. In a way, it reminded me of the fanciest PB&J.  We were one of the last tables there, leaving about 15 minutes before closing. What I love about this place is that we ever felt rushed and were treated so well -- polite + friendly staff, employees cleaning our tables in between meals, our water glasses were always filled, and there was coat check (not at all what I experience elsewhere)! It was lovely and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Again, any restaurant of this level is bound to have a whole lot of haters. I've been reading everywhere of these haters, bringing forth nonesense discussions about portion sizes, simplicity, etc.  We were here for a birthday celebration and it was the first alone time we had since we had a baby 15 months prior to the visit. The expectations were high, we were tense and ready to have our night go to waste with an emergency call.  Let me get to the point; none of these happened. We sat down, beautifully greeted. Place filled up completely in about 20 minutes. Service is incredible, the servers (I believe we have to call them associates or something) are so knowledgeable, you'd feel they cooked up the recipe. I could write a bunch more about their love for the food, but I'll stop here. The food is amazing, don't listen to the haters, the simplicity is KEY. The flavours are so well paired that I, with all my rudeness, took a small piece of bread and WIPED my plate clean! I feel no shame.  DO have that ridicilous ziggy stardust chocolate piece, who cares about the dollar value in the menu, you are NOT on a budget tonight, if you decided to come here, enjoy the experience. One of the best nights of my life, with the beautiful person I fell in love with so many years ago, in a great atmosphere. You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I hate French food. I've been to France twice and have never found the palate for it, so I was very hesitant before going to La Banane.  First, they've done wonderful things with the space.  It doesn't look like The Saint with a new coat of paint.  However, not all tables are created equal, and it's obvious where you fall in the \"cool\" category based on where you are seated.  You can interpret that as you want.  Hostess was friendly and helpful, taking our coats right away.  Now, I can't dock them any points for friendliness.  But, sadly, the one star off of a 5-star experience for me was that everything was TOO friendly and TOO efficient.  We hadn't sat down 15 seconds when we were asked if we had questions.  Plates and drinks were always attempted to be cleared before we done, causing me to rush and to feel embarrassed when I said I wasn't done yet.  And not to suggest we were taking a long time - by the time the bill came, we had been there 90 minutes total and had over 6 courses and 6 drinks.  So....they 100% rushed us, and for no reason.  We were the late seating, so they weren't even hoping to flip the table.  A good way to solve this problem would be to read the table.  If we tell you not to clear plates, realize we are not in a rush.  This restaurant is indulgent, and it's meant to be enjoyed, and it's romantic, and it feels like an atmosphere of savouring.  I didn't walk away feeling like they were on the same page.  The food was amazing, however, and will be the saving grace in these trying first months.  Rich, decadent but somehow subtle at the same time?  Drinks and wine selections were excellent as well.  Little touches (like the banana bread candle burning in the basement) are appreciated.    I will definitely return to indulge again, and hopefully this time, the restaurant will let me."}
{"text":"This place was off the charts in terms of every metric of restaurant success. We could not believe it has only been open two weeks. The staff were all incredibly lovely and professional, and as we watched them, they struck us as a team that had been working together for years. Service was impeccable. The ambiance is lovely, with three distinct spaces, all a little bit different in nature. We were celebrating an anniversary, and were placed in a perfect corner table in the rear section, which is defined by lovely velvet banquettes and chandeliers. The middle section is across from the long bar, and is rounded leather banquettes, with a cleaner, simpler decor. At the front is a more homey section, more like a cafe. Together they make this large space intimate, and suitable for any night out. Now, the food. AMAZING. This is a French restaurant, and the pricing reflects the quality of the food. We tried a lot of dishes, starting with oysters from three different areas. Next we tried the herbed omelette. Then the Albacore tuna, followed by the duck with the frisee salad and pommes Aligot (this dish was SO decadently good we ordered two!). Our last main was the eurobass, a beautiful and flavourful dish. For dessert we splurged on the Ziggy Stardust Disco Egg. The chef owns a chocolate shop, too, and this hand-painted egg was simply a work of art. When smashed it was filled with ancho chili and apricot, some coffee beans, and 9 truffles. WOW. Just WOW. All in all we had a spectacular evening and they should be very proud of what they have created."}
{"text":"Truly exceptional dining experience, atmosphere, service, and food quality/presentation. My dear friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening at La Banane. The decor in stunning, the staff are pleasant, attentive - but not overly so, and very accommodating. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, omelette, duck, and the outrageously gorgeous and delicious Ziggy Stardust Disco Egg for dessert. Zero complaints. Every single bite was delicious. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"GIRLS' NIGHT! The service was exceptional. The drinks delicious. We had the soup and shrimp cocktail and fried chicken and duck and mushroom and Mmm Mmm Mmm"}
{"text":"The food is very good. We had the seafood  platter appetizer minus the crabs legs. Very fresh and good. We also had the pate. For the mains, my party shared the fried chicken and whole fish. The fried chicken was one of the best I have had.  Crispy skin, and tender and juicy.  Dish was light and butter. Side dishes of mushrooms and charred brocolini were good.  We had the disco egg. It us just a novelty and looks great but the taste is just ok.  Service was quite good but for some reason it felt like there was a disconnect between the servers and us although they quite friendly.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and it was a nice meal. First off, the cocktails were great - I loved the Pimm's cup. The starters were the stars here. The raw scallop appetizer was by far my favourite dish. We also had the tuna appetizer, described by our server as bomb, and it was incredible. The foie was delicious and accompanied by some jammy fruit and lovely buttery bread. We also had the crab dish, eurobass baked in salted dough and pommes Aligot side. Mains seemed overwhelmingly salty across the board. Finished off with the Ziggy Stardust egg and it was a real treat. Beautiful to look at, fun to break open and delicious to eat! Definitely on the pricier side, but a nice place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience over all, from main entrees to the bottle of Chablis to well done viande to dessert.  A bit dull the name La Banane, food wise, a masterpiece."}
{"text":"Flawless experience every time. This is a bustling restaurant--make sure to book in advance. For a more private experience, ask for a table either at the front or at the back seating area.   The food is simply outstanding. Having dined at many traditional French restaurants, I feel La Banane is the perfect blend between traditional and modern.   Make sure not to miss these dishes/plates: oysters, wagyu beef, pommes aligot (a must! incredible!), albacore tuna, beef tartare, and the impressive eurobass-en-croute. Yes, the chocolate ziggy stardust disco egg is tres cool and highly instragrammable, but I felt that it was not worth $50 and just too much chocolate for two people."}
{"text":"La Banane, c'est La Loose!  Seriously though, why do all French restaurants in Toronto try to be all hoity toity? Sure, the food at La Banane is alright, but definitely not worth the price and definitely does not represent true French cuisine.    Don't be fooled by the BlogTo articles and all the social hype. Just because the interior of the venue is incredibly beautiful, doesn't mean that the food is exceptionally delicious. Just because the restaurant is on Ossington street, doesn't mean the restaurant is \"cool\".    If you're looking for a real French restaurant with true French cuisine, I suggest Le Paradis (close to Dupont and Avenue Rd) which offers a way more authentic experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is certainly trying, and on that basis alone it is worth a visit. However, it doesn't always succeed at the moment.  It is noisy. In seating I would recommend trying to be given a booth.  We found the wine list limited and slightly pricey. We brought our own bottle of champagne to begin, (corkage $ 35) but no ice bucket was offered.  The decor is dark, and nothing to write home about.  The Jonah crab claws were not expertly cracked and a bit insipid. The King Crab legs, not surprisingly, were frozen. And for these two there was no reasonable accompaniment. There was a cocktail sauce but it tasted as vinegary and overpowering as any commercial cocktail sauce.  The pâté foie was very good and it came with few but good brioche.  The sea bass was small and beautifully presented decorated in pastry before taken away again. It did taste excellent, with lemon zest.  A dish to be recommended.  We were presented with a complimentary Ile Flotante which was a lovely gesture. It was warm and sugary and lusciously soft. It came with Creme Anglaise and pistachios.   I would have given La Banane  3 1/2 stars if I was able."}
{"text":"La Banane is a real culinary experience. It is NOT overhyped. I've come out of Yelp retirement to throw up this review. The ambiance of this place is lovely and traditional, something most new restaurants lack nowadays in my opinion. It is dark and moody, the perfect environment to eat a ton and have deep conversations.  We started our evening with cocktails and the dungeness crab from the raw bar. Delicious. We then had the following: -bread with mustard (the house bread) -liver and onions  -eurobass en croute -pommes aligot -broccolini  -roasted pineapple with tofu pudding  -Cranberry and Port CXBO chocolates  We enjoyed everything thoroughly over a bottle of wine. The eurobass is a must, it was absolutely delicious. We had a wonderful experience and I would not hesitate to return and eat myself into a food coma.   Additionally, all too often I find North American \"foodies\" zero in specifically on the \"worth\" of the food with no inclusion of the experience in the cost. From the moment we walked through the doors we were treated with nothing but respect. Our waiter was knowledgable and informative. The food was served in a perfectly timed fashion. And most importantly, unlike some other restaurants (La Palma, Bar Isabel) where your reservation is more like a timed ticket and they constantly remind you its time to go, this restaurant truly aspires to its French roots: we were not rushed out and allowed to savour our meal and bottle of wine.   Excellent evening, 5 stars. Kudos to Brandon, Sarah and their amazing team."}
{"text":"My wife and I came Sunday evening for her birthday.  We just finished a busy weekend with friends and family so we we were a little low on steam.  The atmosphere at La Banane was Goldilocks zone perfect for us: the restaurant was very busy, but not overly loud, just a casual energy that kept the evening fun and interesting.  All of the staff were fantastic - we counted 6 people who looked after us throughout the evening - the pace of service couldn't have been any better.  Great first impression as we were greeted immediately as we walked through the door.  We shared three cocktails which were a little on the pricey side, but no complaints regarding flavour or strength.  From the kitchen we started with tuna and capers and duck terrine, and when you add the pretzel bread the came to the table it was easily enough for 3-4 people to share.  The portion sizes were quite generous.  I almost ordered something from the cold seafood bar as well (everything looks so delicious), but that would have been too much food.  For the main courses we shared sweetbreads and lobster, grab gratin, and a side of artichokes.  The crab gratin was presented in a stuffed crab shell and was completely full of crab meat.  Sweetbreads and lobster was delicious and the sauce was seasoned beautifully.  Main course portion sizes were, like the starters, very generous.  We had absolutely no issues with portion size or seasoning, as others have indicated in their reviews.  They had a nice selection of cheeses and deserts, which we would normally be all over.  Unfortunately we were absolutely stuffed.  We were told they were out of the ziggy stardust egg.  We saw a few eggs served while we were enjoying our main courses.  Not sure if they have a limited number of eggs each night..?  Our reservation was at 7:30, not late, and they were out of ziggy eggs by 9:00 or so.  Try to get there early if you want to be sure to get the egg.  Maybe there isn't a lesson to be learned here.  It didn't matter to us since we had no room for dessert.  They brought us two beautifully hand painted chocolate bonbons after the meal.  When I booked the reservation through OpenTable I added a note that it was for my wife's birthday.  When the bonbons arrived after dinner they presented them with a birthday candle.   I'm confident the birthday candle would have arrived with a dessert course if we had ordered one.  The candle and bonbons were a very nice touch.  We had a wonderful evening and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, wine, decor.  You can make your own seafood tower, and the fish is all prepared in unique and delicious ways."}
{"text":"Pretentious. Reslly poor service- we waited 2 hours for our meal without a word from our server. And the food is really not that great. I've had way tastier food from a diner. My advice- don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Great spot for a special occasion particularly for the seafood lover. Scallops are a must, mussels and sea bass were all great. The cocktails were diverse and service was prompt. The atmosphere is fairly casual and loud - great for a birthday date."}
{"text":"La Banane is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The food is innovative and French inspired. The atmosphere has a Manhattan / hipster feel.   To start, we had the plump mussels marinated in an espelette pepper vinaigrette. We also ordered oysters and scallops from the raw bar.   For the mains, we had a stunning European sea bass en croute and the duck breast.  The sea bass is a must when you visit La Banane. It is first presented at the table fully enclosed in a pastry.  It was the centre piece of our meal. The rich flavours of the yuzu beurre monte combined with the taste of the fresh sea bass was outstanding. I would highly recommend ordering this dish when you are at La Banane.   If Michelin was to rate the restaurants in Toronto, La Banane would definitely be Michelin worthy."}
{"text":"Pros: - Comfortable seating - Good service - Albacore tuna and fois gras dish was delicious  Cons: - Dishes are overly salty - Omelette with no filling (or also known as plain eggs) is $14... for someone who can appreciate a french-style omelette, personally not for me - Overpriced for what its worth"}
{"text":"I would give this negative stars if I could but unfortunately I have to give it at least one star. I honestly don't know how this place got such great reviews. We were a party of six and all of us agree that these reviews must have been written by their friends/family/employees because no way could anyone think that this was an amazing, or even edible, meal. Had this been made by my 10 year old daughter after watching some food network I would appreciate the effort because she's a kid and because I'm her mom. Other than that, no one who calls themselves a \"chef\" could put out food like this at a restaurant with such great reviews and think that this is good. The pretzel was not warm and it came with regular squeeze bottle mustard (very underwhelming). The only edible dish was the raw oysters and scallop (thank you for not tampering and ruining these ingredients) which came out next. The fish was so salty (no I did not eat the salt crust) and flavourless, the duck felt like it was still alive I had to spit it out and the steak was juicy but lacked any actual flavour but managed to be so salty. The raw tuna with some dill mush came out and after a nibble was left untouched by everyone at the table. Not gonna lie, we were intrigued by the egg and that's what drew us here. It was beautiful but again, salty. An overpriced kinder surprise but kinder surprise has better tasting chocolate. I told my friends who wanted to go here for the egg, I'll send you my photos of the egg for the gram and save you the horrible experience and $750 (our total bill). I feel like my body is dehydrating and preserving itself after that meal. This was by far the most disgusting meal I have ever paid for."}
{"text":"everything was so amazingly delicious and the atmosphere was great. Our waitress was a gem and the whole staff was so kind- not to mention one of the waiters was HOT!!. Definitely will be back and definitely one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"Terrific dinning experience here. We had a big group, so got a family-style tasting menu. We had warm pretzel bread to start. Fresh raw scallops, albacore tuna, and liver pate for appetizers. Sea bass, artichokes, duck, steak, and mashed potatos for the main. And a chocolate disco ball and pineapples with coconut cream for dessert.   The scallops, sea bass, and steak were amazing. The duck was a little chewy, but still quite good. The albacore tuna raw steak was so nice but was ruined by the strong caper sauce on top - would have been better with just some light olive oil and some dill or chives. The liver pate was too fatty and tasted a bit like eating a stick of butter, but the crispy toast and the sweatness from the plum balanced it out. The mashed potato was way too thick and salty. The disco chocolate ball was a really neat idea and cool to try, but it's just some chocolate and truffles. Came with the tasting menu, but definitely wouldn't have paid $50 to order that separately.   Other than the mashed potatoes, which was quite bad, most of the food was very good, and a couple of really stand out dishes (scallops and sea bass). The best thing is, the portions here are very generous even by my standards. Many tasting menus at other restaurants may have 14 courses, but most are tiny and I hate leaving a restaurant still hungry no matter how good the food is. But here at Banane, the portions are large enough that I was actually quite full by the end of the meal.   The atmosphere is quite nice. The servers are very attentive and I like how multiple servers bring out the dishes for the entire table together. Our server wasn't very knowledgeable about the beer selection saying she didn't know because she's not a beer drinker. However, as a server, I think she should be able to answer some basic questions on all items on the menu. But at least she went and asked the bar staff for me.  Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. Will definitely consider coming back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and front desk staff terrific but service is lacking. This is our second time there and the first time (February) was much better. Not sure we'd rush back. Oysters were very good, drinks great, nice wine, good salads and, overall, good food. This time around though, we waited 1.5 hours for our second course (after oysters and salads) and were never asked if we wanted a second glass of wine. Our server was absent at best and when we placed our order he advised us \"great choice, that's my favourite\". He also advised all of the tables around us of the same! I really don't need our server telling me what his favourite dish is but I do need him to be present and on the ball with service. My review is only \"a-ok\" because of the service. Our 6:45 reservation got us out of there at 9:30 and we told him we were in rush when ordered dessert just to get out of there. Not sure I'd rush back."}
{"text":"Given all the glowing reviews and Brandon Olsen's impressive portfolio, we were excited to try La Banane. Perhaps the expectations were a bit too much to live up to. The decor was very nice, although as another reviewer noted, there are two distinct sections of the restaurant, one of which is decidedly more trendy than the other.   We started with the scallops marinated in garlic buttermilk and drizzled with herb oil ($22). The texture was nice, but the sauce was a bit overpowering. We also ordered the infamous eurobass en croute, but were informed that the kitchen had run out of them and was in the process of making more. The waitress asked us if we wanted to wait so I asked if they had an approximate time. When she came back, she repeated that it would take a while and asked if we wanted to order something else. While the service was courteous, it was a bit off-putting to not get some sort of time estimate, and it felt as if we were being asked to kindly reconsider our menu choice. Instead, we opted for the crab back gratin ($35), a mix of crab meat, bomba rice, and comté cheese served in a crab back and baked. This was described as a sort of risotto, and came with a good amount of crab meat and a small side of frisée salad. The gratin was tasty, and the mixture of ingredients was very savoury. In contrast, the frisée tasted like it was doused in lemon juice or vinegar as it was far too sour. The last dish we had was the calf-brain ravioli ($22), which was good but unremarkable. The eurobass was indeed popular, as both tables beside ours ended up receiving theirs and mentioned that the beurre blanc was too salty.  Overall, La Banane was underwhelming. Seasoning was rather aggressive throughout. While the food quality was not bad, at this price point \"not bad\" is not good enough."}
{"text":"Raw marinated scallops - garlic buttermilk ($23) Sauce is spicy, scallop texture is way better than the slight fishy taste  Albacore tuna - brown butter, capers, dill ($16) Loaded with capers. Perfect tuna taste & texture  Seared foie gras - hazelnut, passionfruit gastrique ($28) Sharp passion fruit sauce  Fried chicken - buttermilk, Cayenne ($18) Juiciest fried chicken. Ranch sauce is heavy in flavour  Smoked sweetbreads - endive, mushrooms, sauce blanquette ($28) With pickled onions. Sweetbreads were probably the thymus gland. Soft and seared exterior.  Best sauce. Like mushroom parsnip cream soup.  Gateau a la Banane ($12) add salted caramel icecream ($6) Overly ripened bananas. Really good dessert. Perfect crust. Salted caramel goes well with it."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go to La Banane. It took us time to get a reservation for a table but having been there I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar. The ambiance is wonderful and the food...oh the food...so very amazingly french. My husband and I ended sharing all the plates. I am so looking forward to going again and trying something new."}
{"text":"Our favourite dishes: scallops, flat iron with yummy gratin, and confit. We also shared the CXBO chocolate egg which now contains 7 truffles, scattering of dried cherries and aerated chocolate chunks!"}
{"text":"Curious to try the \"hot new spot\" around town my friends and I managed to get a reservation at this restaurant for a Monday night.   It was still packed!We decided to grab a few items and just share amongst ourselves so we could try a variety of dishes.  I'm a bit surprised about all the glowing reviews but here's my 2 cents:  The Good  - great spot I think for drinks/apps/desserts.  They have a seafood bar which I think would be a fun place to sit and absorb in the vibe of this restaurant.   - I think this is a great pre-drinking place - it's fun, the drinks are good and the apps are pretty nice.  For apps we ordered some oysters and the albacore tuna with brown butter, dill and caper.  This was quite nice - the cold of the tuna with the warm of the sauce was a little party in my mouth.  I won't lie - it certainly didn't look appetizing, but don't let that fool you.  The Bad  - honestly none of us particularly liked any of the mains.  We ordered the duck breast with charred endive and they had a special that night for fish (trying to remember the name but just can't at the moment).  We ordered a side of Pommes Aligot.   Let's start with the duck.  It came out looking like a shriveled sausage and it was lukewarm at best.  We ate this right away (it wasn't sitting on the table while we talked) so I know it wasn't anything to do with us waiting to eat it.  Was not impressed at all.  Lacked any flavor.  The fish - it was ok, covered in a sauce.  It was ok until we saw the bill and noticed it cost us $45.   Yes this is totally our fault for not asking about the price beforehand.  !00%.  But it was still $45 I will never get back.  Ok - the star of the night for me was the Pomme Aligot - this is a dish where cheese is blended into the mashed potatoes - umm....I had no shame in literally trying to scoop out all this deliciousness.  This little bowl of relatively simple potatoes saved the night for me - I'm still dreaming about it today.  The highlight of this restaurant is their Ziggy Stardust dessert (google it).  I really wanted to try it (hence the main reason that I wanted to come here) but then saw on the menu it was $50.  Sorry, had to pass.  I would get it if I was here just for a drink and dessert (a group of 4-5 people to share  is doable for the price just for the experience)   Overall a great starting off date spot but I don't think I would come back here for a full meal.  Pass the banana on the left hand side...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Although super hard to get a reservation that's not at the bar table it's worth it if you get a chance to come here.  Always a great dining experience ~ the fish is great and the appetizers (oysters and crab - are great).  We had a steak option, the fish and omelette which were all delicious.  The salad is good and the side of mashed potatoes is more like a side a ooey gooey goodness (cheese) blended with a bit of potato.  And the chocolate egg thing is great ~ way easier to  share amongst 6 guests than 3.  The service and wine list were great too."}
{"text":"This seems to be a new popular spot and I was excited to give it a try. Me and my friend made a reservation and we were seated in the back. The back is darker and more intimate. I love the ambience of the restaurant.   Service: Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. He checked up on us often and ensured we had everything we wanted.   Food: Me and my friend ordered the veal tartare for appetizer. For mains, we ordered the duck breast and sweetbreads. We also got a side of mushroom to share.   Veal Tartare- The tartare had crispy potato. Everything went really well together. This was the best dish of the night.   Sweetbreads- I like sweetbreads and I really like heavy rich sauces. I am so glad I ordered this, the sauce is amazing if you like really creamy sauces.   Duck Breast- I thought this was pretty typical and average. Nothing stood out about this one. It was an okay dish.   My experience at La Banane was good but it wasn't anything amazing. I had higher expectations. The ambience is lovely and the food is decent. However, given the prices, I would rather go to other French restaurants."}
{"text":"Pretty but a tad overhyped.  While the food is undeniably good, it's not that different from the other high-end French restaurants in the city. And while the focus on seafood was welcome, and the cook of the food was skillful (the Eurobass En Croûte was excellently done so the meat was juicy; the Pommes Aligot is a definite must if you like cheese, mashed potato, or both), it wasn't an amazingly different experience for us.  All the dishes we had were beautifully presented and expertly executed. Given all the hype though, we were expecting new flavours and experiences, and were left wanting just a bit more."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great environment. You can really tell that the chef's really have passion in  what they are cooking. This place is a must for anyone who loves food!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner at La Banane   @foodcoverto  Started with the Petite seafood platter which comes with 3 types of oysters, mussels, shrimps, scallops, and half a lobster tail.  Next was the lobster croquette! Freshly fried so the insides were nice and hot. Must get!  I forgot which fish it was but it was baked in a salty pastry so the fish absorbed the seasoning. They de-bone and remove the skin before serving. The fish is amazing soft.  For desserts, we has the 3 cheese that comes with an incredibly light toast. Selection of cheeses are superb.  2nd dessert: Apple + pastry + vanilla icecream. I think they make their own icecream. It was truely creamy! 3rd dessert: Unfortunately they were sold out on the big egg  so we opted for the 9 piece chocolates. Definitely did not regret it. Each flavour was unique and the shells of the chocolates are so thin.  And to end the post, our waiter was absolutely splendid. Will have to go back just to get that egg"}
{"text":"Best front of house!!! I didn't catch her name but the hostess is the best in the city bar none!!! And it just kept getting better, the food, the service, they comped some drinks for my daughters birthday . Even the coat check was great!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so overrated.   We made reservations on a Thursday evening but it was already booked up many days in advance so we sat at the raw bar which was fine as it was interesting to see the bartenders and chefs work. When we entered the hostess seemed busy and distracted and didn't even look up to greet us. Service did not get better as the evening progressed. Our server clearly forgot about taking our orders and we had to wait an incredibly long time. For a restaurant of this calibre, I expected service to be on point.   We started with the crab croquettes which were tasty but could have used a better presentation. I opted for the eurobass as it has everyone talking but it was not a spectacular dish. Good? Yes, but not worth a price tag of $39. Highlights of the meal were the beet side dish which I easily could have recreated at home and the mustard served with the complimentary pretzel bread.   I left La Banane grumpy and disappointed. I do not recommend this place and I will not return."}
{"text":"We have been going a lot lately to these new and hip restaurants on Ossington.  This one is a french style  restaurant with superb presentation and dishes like duck confit, waigu steak, eurobass - all three of which were done well, eurobass in particular came in a inedible salty dough platter, which was interesting, texture of the fish is similar to a tilapia.  Crab cake app was delicious, but the raw scallop was not, slimy nothingness in the mouth with a sauce that was overpowering.  Seared is still the best way to have these or maybe in a ceviche.  The fried bread slices was another you-cannot-eat-just-one type of item, and was hard not to fill up on those, while the duck fat fried pretzels did not taste anything special.  Foie gras was a good to share appetizer as well.  Ambiance was busy and modern, and wait for people without reservation on the weekend was 30 to 45 mins if not more.  Service was excellent.  I would definitely pay a visit if in the mood for French food.  Ran $200 per couple wine included."}
{"text":"A really lovely meal and great addition to the neighbourhood. Started with oysters (wonderful and fresh as you would expect), scallops (less excited by these drenched in  buttermilk sauce) and pate with brioche- can't go wrong with that.  All accompanied with the warm, salty pretzel pieces. Spent most of my time eyeing other tables to see if they had any left.   We had the Eurobass which was perfectly cooked - moist, flaky, well seasoned (it does pick up a bit of the salt from the crust but not overwhelming) and a big portion. Duck which again was very good - rich, perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The portion was huge - a really big duck breast almost too much. Trout was similarly perfect - well seasoned, reasonable portion and a bit lighter. Sides of mushrooms - woodsy and taste like real mushrooms and brocolini - crisp , warm and well cooked.   Make sure you make room for the gateau. Warm, moist with a light crisp exterior and warm rich interior. Elegant and perfect with its minimalism. We had with the salted caramel ice cream, which I would skip next time (strong caramel, a bit on the toasted side and aggressively salted)   Good wine list. Attentive and informed service.  Loud place for conversation - we were at the front, looks more intimate at the back.   With drinks and some good wine not hard to drop $500 for four ($$$$)."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked appetizers, main dishes and sides, perfectly presented by a professional wait staff that had personality and charisma. Scallops from the raw bar were delicious, as was our steak,, eurobass and broccolini. One of our new favorite places in TO. Would eat there again and again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent and the service is great!  It's a perfect date night and a place to go on a special occasion because the food is pricey.  I had the Eurobass en croute.  You get to see how they cook the fish prior to plating.  The fish is deboned and fantastic.  My husband mention that La Banane is the best restaurant he has been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Trying to find a spot for French fare in Toronto can be a daunting task, but thank God places like this exist to renew your faith. We were fortunate enough to pass by on a snowy night and were able to forego the reservation process.  The décor is simple, but sophisticated, falling somewhere between simple French bistro and King West.  Nice selections on the menu, which make me anxious to go back and explore. We opted for some oysters and cocktails. The oysters were pretty average, but the cocktails were interesting. A modern twist on some classics like the French 75 and a variety of other Champagne cocktails.  Mains included the eurobass en croute, the duck confit with cabbage, and a side of aligote. The fish was perfectly cooked, flaky, and very interestingly executed. Definitely a statement piece, and a must-try. The duck was also a big hit. It was tender, moist and flavourful with perfectly crisp skin and an interesting reduction of some kind. It's richness was perfectly balanced by the sharpness of the cabbage. I don't think aligote could ever be less than amazing, so I'm not sure how much further I can dive into that.  Over all, it's not a bargain of a meal, but if you're in the mood for French cuisine, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything better or more interesting than La Banane."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for the first time from California.  I found this restaurant through Yelp and what a great find it was.  A hip French inspired bistro in a cool part of town.  Our server, Sara, instantly put us at ease and made the entire dinner a joy.  And the food was terrific! My boeuf tartare was among the best I ever had and the lobster ravioli, Oh My! Everything was at least good if not fantastic.  The Ziggy Stardust chocolate dessert was a whimsical delight--essentially a dark chocolate piñata full of chocolate treasures.  I was not impressed with the wines but I was limited to the wine by the glass choices which were extremely limited compared with the otherwise extensive wine list.         The dinner was not cheap about $100 USD per person but well worth the money.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Caught La Banane last night and really enjoyed it.  The steak for two is great for three.  The duck was also good.  The cheese is a bit pricey and they could do better bread with it.  Oysters were on point, briny, not overwhelmingly seafoodie.  Strong wine list.  Expensive, but a great ambiance.  Sorry that was a stream of thought, but overall a nice place for a date or a work dinner.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"La Banane is both delicious and consistent.   The seafood platter is my favourite in the city; the fish is fresh and overwhelmingly delicious. The dipping sauces are fantastic, the flavours are exactly what you'd hope for, and every dish is extremely well crafted!   Wine + Cocktails are both excellent too!   Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First rate food and service. One of the best restaurants in Toronto, hands down. I look forward to returning again and again."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. A little pricy but worth it. We asked them if they accept mobile pay because my boyfriend forgot his wallet they said as far as they know , they don't but they can try after we finish our meal. They did not judge us. We tried the mobile pay but it didn't work. So we ended up asked the waiter for my jacket front he coat check to get my wallet for the bill"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and atmosphere.  Service is on point and knowledgeable.  Recommend the king crab from the raw bar and the omelette.  Those were my two favourites.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary. A rare instance where the hype is warranted! We did seafood all the way - lobster was easy to get into and the butter sauce gorgeous. Seared tuna with a gremolita and more butter (butter is a theme here in an excellent way). The eurobass of course. Service was exceptional, wine list great mix of French standouts and local gems. Pretzels and mustard as the bread option kinda odd for a French restaurant but delish. Check it out, especially if you are a seafood lover!"}
{"text":"La Banane is a restaurant for a special occasion, or a place to impress that special someone. The prices are steep for this stretch of Ossington. But, if you are willing to splurge, you will have a wonderful dinner here.   The fare is pretty traditional French, with some modern flare, but don't expect unique flavours of fusion influences. Still, they serve tasty dishes, well executed, it an attractive setting, with flawless service.   Here's the rundown: Albacore Tuna Appetizer $16 Rating: 4/5 A tasty serving of fresh tuna with tangy capers sauce  Traditional bouillabaisse Rating: 4/5 Tasty bouillabaisse, cleanly executed, but too light on the safron. Served in an attractive presentation with puff pastry on top.   Eurobass en croute $39 Rating 4/5 One of their staple dishes. Beautiful fish, elegantly crusted.  Rainbow Trout Rating: 4/5 Beautiful, traditional French sauce.  Accompaniment: Mushroom Confit - $10 Rating: 2/5 Skippable."}
{"text":"Start to finish wonderful experience. A+ from the service to the food. Even let us sit down at the bar when we came a bit early before our reso. Beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic service.  Art Deco decor.  Fine attention to detail.  Great place for a date, business dinner, or just to catch up with family or friends.  The raw bar offers a great assortment of seafood.  We really enjoyed the oysters.   The bouillabaisse vol e vent was so good.  The piece de resistance is the artisanal chocolate selection made by CXBO.  Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We had a really lovely dinner here. Beautiful, classy modern French bistro interior. We started with the seafood petit plateau (which was grande). The oysters, crab, mussels, and scallops were as fresh as it gets in TO, just excellent, and our other mains (sweetbreads and the crab gratine) were equally delicious. The chocolate egg is not to be missed. Service was friendly and attentive. We look forward to going back and exploring the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It is a wonderful place to have a nice dinner and a little too much to drink. We were there with a large group of 8 people, and it couldn't have been better. We started off with salted pretzels with mustard, chicken liver pâté followed by a shrimp cocktail, then albacore with capers, dill and brown butter. We had a little break after that to catch our breath and smoke a joint outside, and when we came back in there was even more food. Eurobass en croute with a tasty yuzu sauce, then some duck... I can't really remember everything but I think that's it. For dessert we had one of the famous disco eggs. They made a special one for a friend who was visiting out of town and it was so nice. After that, cheese and sweet vermouth and more chocolate. Oh yeah, we had wine pairings with every course, too, and champagne at the beginning. Outstanding food and service. Go to La Banane."}
{"text":"At the end of dinner, my friend remarked \"I think that was the best dinner I've ever had in Toronto.\"  Everything was excellent.  Appetizers:  bouillabaisse surrounded by puff pastry was like art and tasted even better. Veal tartare was good.  The oysters were the best my friend has had (and he always orders oysters).  The mains:  carved steak, duck confit and the veal were only interchangeable, for the fact that they were all delicious.  The steak and veal were expertly cooked.  The steak was accompanied by a delicious sauce. The duck confit was - again - the best I've tasted in the city.  The sides:  my review will be boring because they too were all good.  From the charred broccolini in a delectable sauce, to the too cheesy mashed potatoes (not a criticism), to the flavourful hearty mushrooms, to the perfectly seasoned roast potatoes.  Service:  fantastic. Equal parts fun and professional.  I wish I got my server's name, to mention it here.  Unfortunately, I can only refer to him as the blonde guy with the mischievous smile.   Space:  very cool and chic, without being standoffish.  There's a long, beautiful bar, with banquettes (try and get one), and tables in the front.   I'm already looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am highly biased and naturally inclined towards the type of French food that La Banane serves. I'm also a sucker for the Art Deco/1920s-style interior which, like the food, is a bit of a throwback but also has some modern touches. The food complements the decor and vice versa.  If you like to eat things which are heavily sauced, pastry-encrusted, served with caviar and definitely off the Weightwatchers chart, come here. Prices are on the high end for Toronto, and the area, but the portions are surprisingly massive. (Our $27 crab claw plate came with, I think, four whole legs and claws, for example. And the trout, a dish for one, was at least an inch thick and must have weighed close to a pound.) I'd say order less than you think you need, but that would ruin the fun. Eating at La Banane feels like a celebratory occasion, even if you have nothing to celebrate.  Only nits for me are the fact that it was extremely warm in the restaurant (or at least in the back room) and they should give you a nice little finger bowl if you are ordering from the raw bar, or at least something as messy as the crab claws. It'd be a nice touch and one I think the decor and feel warrant. (I'm also generally hesitant to give 5 stars to a place that's only been open a couple weeks. I like to see consistency.)  Bottom line is they've done a world-class job of creating a certain atmosphere here, from the food to the design to the music. If you want to show your friends from out of town -- friends from much cooler places than Toronto -- that Toronto can be cool, take them here. Or just come if you want to have a good time and eat some good, diet-ruining food."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to impress on all fronts.   -Fun service from informed waiter -Clean restaurant and beautiful decor -Very high quality food  I came on a friday night at 6 with my S.O. for a quick bite before her birthday party. Was lucky without a reso but I recommend getting one.  The raw bar items are served beautiful and quickly. The scallops with buttermilk and leek oil sauce were divine.  The warm dill and caper topping on the fresh albacore tuna was really good even if it looked weird.  Pommes aligot was really yummy, make sure to eat it hot before the cheese gets too cold to stretch.  The cute little fluffy omelette was fun to jiggle."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been so impressed with the food at a restaurant. After dining at La Banane last month, I couldn't stop raving about it to anyone who was willing to listen to me.  Tip: If you can't get a reservation and have a small group, try walking in for an early dinner (around 6 PM) and you will probably be able to get a seat at the raw bar. I went with two other friends on a Sunday night, and the restaurant was pretty empty and we were able to get seated at the bar right away. Plus, the service at the bar was pretty attentive, and we were able to place our orders for food and drinks as soon as we were ready.  My friends and I ordered a bunch of dishes and just shared for the most part. We started with an artichoke dish, which was one of their specials that day. It was lovely and had this really rich, creamy, fragrant buttery sauce that somehow still managed to avoid being too heavy. We also tried the albacore tuna (also had a lovely and buttery sauce to it - a common theme here, I guess - but wasn't so overpowering that we couldn't taste the tuna), calf-brain ravioli (these were nothing too interesting), crab back gratin (this was quite good, but overshadowed by the eurobass), and eurobass en croute.  The star of our meal was hands down the eurobass, and it's the dish you'll see tons of pictures of, with the fish wrapped in puff pastry. They bring out the fish to you all wrapped up so you can see it/take a photo, then they return to the kitchen to remove the top of the pastry and debone the fish. I was surprised by how soft and moist the fish was, and it was also incredibly flavourful with the yuzu beurre blanc. The pastry is super salty, so it's not recommended you eat it, but I guess the purpose is to keep all the flavour sealed inside the fish while it cooks. Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying.  I left feeling satiated, but surprisingly not grossly full, despite the richness of most of the dishes. It is a bit on the pricier side, and the bill can start racking up quite quickly, especially if you get a lot of stuff to share. I thought it was still pretty reasonable considering how many different dishes we got to try - our total bill with two drinks was around $220 for 3 people.  The restaurant is beautiful, and the ambiance is classy but not pretentious. I found all the staff to be very nice, and most of the other patrons weren't super dressed up.  I would absolutely come here again! There are other items on their menu I definitely want to try, and I would also love to come on a special occasion so I have an excuse to try the $50 ziggy stardust chocolate egg :D"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 Stars. The menu offers a few interesting items, but prices are inflated to gloat the hype. Chef Brandon Olsen does offer a culinary experience, but one that falls short of fulfilling expectations."}
{"text":"Loved my dining experience here. Service was excellent and food was phenomenal. Every dish was delicious. A wonderful restaurant for a special occasion or when you're looking to impress.  Starters: The Raw Marinated Scallops ($23)  were extremely fresh and sweet and melted in my mouth. The garlic buttermilk sauce was rich and creamy and the herb flavour in it was an interesting touch.  The Albacore Tuna ($16) was absolutely delicious. Topped with brown butter, dill and capers, the flavour was bold and the warm toppings were a nice contrast to the cool tuna. Highly recommended.  Mains: I can see why everyone raves about the Eurobass En Croûte ($39). A whole Mediterranean seabass is done in a Branzino style which is baked in a salt dough which seals in the juices. The fish is first presented at the table in its pastry crust and then taken back to the kitchen where it is carved, skinned and deboned to reveal the fish filet inside. The result is an incredibly moist and tender fish with great fresh sea flavour. The beurre blanc had a strong yuzu flavour and the acidity really helped to balance out the heaviness of the sauce. The zucchini were pared down beautifully and added a nice crunch and freshness to the dish.  The Duck Breast ($29) was also delicious but less innovative than the seabass. The lean Muscovy duck is cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was super juicy with a crisp skin and had a perfect balance of fat and an interesting reduction. The charred endive and prune on the side paired really well with the sweetness of the prune balancing the bitterness of the endive.  Dessert: It's a bit of a splurge, but the Ziggy Stardust Disco Egg ($50) is a pretty fun way to end the evening. Coming from Olsen's CXBO line, each egg is splattered by hand so that every egg is unique. It is then filled with hand rolled single-origin Peruvian dark #chocolate #truffles, dried apricots, ancho chillies and coffee beans. To eat the egg, you're given a spoon which you use to smash the egg and then you can eat the chocolate shell as well as the yummy treats inside.  The concept is pretty unique and the egg is extremely Instagrammable. But over and above that, I really liked how the tiny pieces of apricot added a little bit of chew and acidity to the rich chocolate. Similarily, the flecks of chilli and coffee beans gave the chocolate that added oomph in flavour."}
{"text":"Beautiful French modern interior with upscale bistro feel. Top notch service.  Cozy booths. Lots of seafood & shellfish. Great cocktail menu. Good for girls night (not more than 4-5 people), good date spot, or sit at the bar for drinks & apps after work."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Slow kitchen, overcooked (too browned) fried chicken, and ice cream weighing down souffle. Eurobass was not crisscrossed like in social media photos, just thick strips, but the fish was definitely delicious inside, though not sure why it's topped with strange, hard zucchini shapes which are too much of a contrast weighing down the delicate fish. Mains don't come with any sides FYI. Menu is a bit haphazard, lacking in cohesion. Pretzel buns with ball park mustard are the \"bread and butter\" served at the start of the meal.  Probably shouldn't be called a French restaurant. If it was billed as a Canadian/eclectic restaurant, would be more accurate. Some good points, which is why still 3 stars. But we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  Lovely!  From the moment you enter you are in a French Bistro.  We were seated at a very nice (but kind of uncomfortable) green velvet banquette and oval marble table.  Good location at the front of the restaurant since it was quiet enough to have a conversation.  Service: Excellent!  Several waitstaff attended to our table.  They were very accommodating and met all our requests.  Not one refused when we asked for a special food preparation etc.  They did not rush us but each course was timed perfectly once we had ordered.  Food:  Quite delicious.  The salted fish special was tasty and not the least bit too salty.  The duck was a bit too chewy but good.  The sweetbreads were so good we placed a second order!  All the vegetables were done to perfection.  The pineapple cake and floating cloud were both a perfect ending.  One small suggestion to the management:  Offer black napkins as well as white.  The lint from the white napkin was all over over black pants by the end of the evening."}
{"text":"There was a big group of us and they were able to serve us all perfectly. We did a set menu with four courses, and everyone at the table was impressed with both the food and the service we received. Both the seafood and steak were delicious and their cheesy mashed potatoes were an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. For dessert, taste-wise, we much preferred their banana cake to the instagram- worthy hand-painted egg. That said, the truffles inside the chocolate egg were delicious. As well, they brought us chocolates at the end of our meal. I suggest asking for the orange blossom if they have available. Overall great experience and would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Everything I hate in the \"new\" Toronto! Home hipster-pseudo-cool but in fact arrogant. Ambitious but amateur cuisine (it starts from the appetizer that evokes a poor mustard dip) Surrealist prizes ($ 13 for a bad \"Aligot\" in a saucer that would make any Auvergnat cry _of despair_) We ask for bread to try to mop up the sauce (made of rare ingredients of course); We were brought you two slices of white bread toasted and buttered (and that's extra). And then the dessert ... an Easter egg with three truffles inside !! Really?! $ 300 for two with the cheapest wine. In fact a restaurant for \"Nouveaux Riches\" who do not know French Cuisine and get easily mystified. RUN AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, it's a good thing the portions are small as the salt content in the dishes is quite high. The Pommes Aligot was amazing, the Eurobass was also amazing so were their Oysters, and the Tuna.  The cocktails are very good. The service was a little slow, but otherwise great ambience and dining experience."}
