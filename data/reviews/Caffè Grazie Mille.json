{"text":"After all of the stellar Yelp reviews of the coffee here, I made the trek from my Airbnb in old Rosemont for what I hoped would be a great cup of coffee. Passing up a number of great looking coffee houses on the way, I was dismayed to discover that the earlier reviews of this place are just plain wrong.  I should have known something was wrong when the barista asked whether I wanted sugar in my latte. Waiting for it became unappetizing as flies started buzzing around food being prepared. The coffee ended up being watery, burnt, and tasteless. A machine-made cup would have likely been better.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The coffee's no good, always over cooked, hell burned!"}
{"text":"I adore this place, because one is always welcomed like family. Impeccable paninis and simple, yet delicious treats (Italian chocolates, sodas, etc), one cannot go wrong at this place. Slick, modern Italian interior yet feels like a cozy, neighborhood café. Wish I could go more often. :)"}
{"text":"Perfect coffee.  Super friendly service.    I don't know anyone in the city of Montreal, but when we walked away from this cafe, my 6-year-old son said, \"Now you have a friend in Montreal, Mom\"."}
{"text":"Great coffee and hot chocolate for the kids.  People were friendly and helpful. The panini's looked great, but we had just bought a few bagels from fairmount bagel next door."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee! Found it because I purchased a bagel at Fairmount Bagels and they do not have their own seating or other breakfast items like coffee. Very happy to discover great coffee nearby. The owner immediately strikes up a conversation and even recommended some places to visit in Montreal. This place deserves your business."}
{"text":"Good coffee, friendly owner. Perhaps a little over-friendly, I just wanted to sit and eat. Sandwiches look great, but I came with a couple bagels from Fairmount Bagel nearby, he didn't mind that I was drinking his coffee and eating food from next door."}
{"text":"The hot cocoa is great! The waiter gave us a free homemade chocolate truffle! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Excellents panini ! Un très grande variété, Le service est toujours excellent ainsi que l'atmosphère de l'endroit, tous les aliments sont toujours frais. Même s'ils vous voient pour la première fois, les employés vont vous acccueillir et vous servir comme si vous étiez membres de leur famille. Il n'y a rien de faux dans leur gentillesse, ce sont de vraiment bonne personnes pour travailler avec le public."}
{"text":"Great espresso, salads and paninis. Nat, the owner, treats you like family."}
{"text":"The owner was very friendly. Ordered an espresso and a pistachio filled chocolate shell cannoli. Freshly filled. Shell was crisp, a bit dense but good. Filling was light and not like the cannolis in BrooklynorMore like a ricotta and whipped cream blend."}
{"text":"The owner of this shop is an energizing and charismatic 48-year-old man. After realizing his career as an executive chef was not worth the stress, he left it behind and opened this quaint shop. 30 years later, he is brightening customers' days with coffee, genuine conversation, and delectable baked goods, including PHENOMENAL cannolis. (\"The price for each cannoli is 3.25. Preparing them fresh and in front of your eyes? Priceless.\").  Though somewhat inconspicuous to the outside passerby, this cafe is truly a gem to discover."}
{"text":"So I walk into this corner coffee shop next door to Fairmount Bagels and the classic \"dammit-I-wish-I-knew-about-this-place-before-I-went-back-home\" thought punished my brain all the way back to NYC.  Why? Because I just stopped in with my wife and 3-year old son for what was easily the best cup of coffee in Montreal...and was treated like the best family in the world. All that, plus being teased by watching the owner's wife making the day's hero and panini specials from scratch...damn I should've copped a hero for the road.  They even gave my son a bag of candies as they thanked us for stopping by. Another reason for this Bronx-born-and-raised dude to call Montreal my second home. We shall return soon and so should you..especially if you're fortunate to call this culinary mecca home."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce petit café lors d'une balade dans le Mile-End. Lorsque j'ai vu l'annonce de Cannolis dans la fenêtre, mon estomac s'est manifesté. Le propriétaire me parla de la recette originale inventée par son grand-oncle afin de venter la qualité de celle-ci. Effectivement, ce fût plus que délicieux. On goûte le ricotta comme il se doit et le mélange n'est pas trop sucré. L'accord des Cannolis avec un café du Grazie Mile = gros coup de coeur!"}
{"text":"On the hunt for coffee after I ate at fairmount bagels I stumbled upon caffe grazie millie.   I was truly just planning on a coffee but I saw all these amazing treats and I knew I needed to try something. I saw the stack of empty cannolli shells and a freshly made cannolli sounded awesome. I ordered a double shot espresso with a mini cannolli. My friend ordered a cappuccino with an almond biscotti.   The coffee and treats were ready quickly. This espresso had to be the best I have ever had. I put no sugar in it and it was prefectly balanced not overly bitter and great drinkable temperature. It was an espresso I wish was the size of a cup of coffee I just wanted to savour it forever. My cannolli was also fantastic. The cream was super light and delicious. You can tell it was freshly made.   I got a bite of my friends biscotti and it was also amazing. It was a little chewier than most biscotti I have had in the past which I prefer.   Aside from baked goods this cafe has a wide menu of great looking sandwiches, salads etc. A lovely place to grab lunch or coffee."}
{"text":"Ok, so to be honest I didn't have much food here. BUT, what I did have was an awesome experience escaping the rainy weather for a few minutes while exploring the neighborhood.  Walked into this place and was immediately greeted by a super friendly guy behind the counter that was just full of jokes. He engaged my girlfriend and I in conversation and was awesome. We just ordered some hot drinks (both great) and one of the homemade biscotti which was seriously incredible. Our friend behind the counter told us it would be the best one we had ever had and he was not wrong.   Left this place wanting to move in down the street so this could be my go to cafe...definitely hope to make it back someday soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing pastry and coffee. The cortado is amazing and the cannoli impressive. The owner is so cool he makes the joint vibrant with his personality and amazing treats and delicacies. He speaks, English, French and I'd assume Italian. A definite do not miss when in Montreal. Fairmont area is gritty and this is a gem!"}
{"text":"I came in here today to get a coffee and was looking at the menu when the guy behind the counter, under the menu says, \"hey beautiful, you're looking at me with your little oriental eyes and it's making me blush.\"   I didn't want to be too harsh and tell him to go F himself so I just said, \"that's derogatory\", and walked out. When he sarcastically called after me to \"have a nice day\", I just gave him the finger. In a city and neighborhood so diverse, this is how you would treat a customer? There is no dearth of cafes in a 2 block radius. I would not support this racist business. I'd give you zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great Cannolis    We were next door at Kem CoBa getting ice cream and sitting outside when a person from Caffe Grazie Mille came out with samples of their great cannoli."}
{"text":"Caffe Grazie-Mille is a cozy sandwiches/soup/salad cafe.  Our group of four visited in a non eventful Monday late afternoon.  The owner and the store assistant were super nice.  The menu was in French, so the assistant patiently explained to us, in English, the various combos.  We all opted for some types of sandwiches combos.  Mine was a smoked salmon panini plus mushroom salad plus coffee.  The mushroom salad was delicious.  It looked so sophisticated yet easy to make.  I recommend it.  The sandwiches was okay.  The coffee was very good - rich, smooth, textured.  If you come to Fairmont Avenue West for bagels, don't forget to walk a few steps to this little cafe for coffee."}
{"text":"Came here for coffee before I went on a long road trip - gentleman running the shop was incredibly friendly and even topped my iced coffee off with an espresso shot just for the hell of it. Five stars."}
{"text":"This review is for the Barista!   Thank you for making me a proper double americano! It was fab!"}
{"text":"Yay, I'm a fan! Voici mon café préféré dans le Mille End. J'adore ce petit endroit qui affiche sans prétention ses racines italiennes. Le sympathique propriétaire nous accueil toujours avec bonne humeur. C'est la place idéale pour prendre une bouché rapide en semaine, ou pour relaxer une heure ou deux en sirotant un expresso le week-end.   Au menu, des sandwichs italiens, des salades, des pâtisseries et, bien sur, des expressos. Rien de très élaboré, mais les sandwichs grillés (une douzaine en tout) sur pain Panini sont délicieux et croustillants. Je vous conseil le \"Sud\" si vous aimez la charcuterie épicée ou encore le \"Dindo\" avec ses bonnes tranches de dindes fumées. Complétez le tout avec un latté et le tour est joué.  J'enlève une étoile à ma note car la place n'a pas l'air climatisé, et l'été, ça devient très chaud à l'intérieur. Il faut donc se réfugier sur la petite terrasse qui flanque le commerce. Aussi, le payement se fait en argent comptant uniquement, ce qui devient un problème de nos jours.   Pour relaxer devant un sandwich et un café la fin de semaine, je recommande."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place, all the way from New York City for many years. I can't help at but laugh at the clowns who have written negative reviews about this place. Their is no need for this; Take my word and my friends will agree - This place may have the best coffee and expresso on the planet earth; I just can't seem to figure this out - But, they do.   I typically hit up Schwartz's before I go there. I bring my \"Sack\" of Bagels and enjoy them with the amazing coffee and beverages that are served here.  They have a lot of food options; I'm not a fan of these - Because you have Fairmont Bagel a few doors down; But - whatever floats your boat; Again - I am coming here for the amazing coffee and coffee drinks.  The owners are super friendly people! A Sister and Brother. They are extremely hard working people and very kind. I think, the store is primarily run by the brother - He is really a nice guy and goes out of this way to make all the customers feel special.   Again - Another must on my list when I roll into Montreal; You will not find a better cup of coffee. These guys are the true masters. They have some really awesome outdoor seating that you can utilize all year round.  See you guys again soon!  Regards!"}
{"text":"The best coffee in Montreal! We walked into the door 4 years ago with our 6 months old twin boys on a Sunday morning. They welcomed us like we were family and they also treat our boys with lady fingers which they are hooked ever since. Easily the best coffee in town, non pretentious, down to earth good italian coffee, panini, and soup all made from scratch! We love this place!"}
{"text":"On a recent family trip to Montréal, we wanted to visit the Mile End neighbourhood. We were looking for some coffee and a snack and this corner location beckoned us inside. Nat, the owner, was very friendly and engaging. While brewing our coffee (some of the best we've ever had - including Europe) and preparing our food he gave us a brief history lesson on Montréal and some insights about his lovely family. He treated us like we were family (or at least regular customers). He kept our 9 1/2-year-old totally engaged! The food was also excellent! Just as we were paying our tab, he gave us some complimentary snacks for the road. What a find! We will definitely stop in on our next trip to that lovely city."}
{"text":"I went to Fairmount Bagel for the first time and didn't know they didn't sell coffee. So I took my bagel, got a coffee and sat in a bench on the sidewalk. Excellent coffee. Be warned that if you get an Americano, it will be scalding hot, but good. The owner is a character, but very friendly if you take the time to be friendly too."}
