{"text":"Today  April 5th. We arrived at 13:30, sign outside said open.  Door to restaurant Closed, I guess phone ahead, very inconvenient   Obviously cannot comment on the food/service."}
{"text":"Positive aspects: The food is tasty and has an outdoor seating area. Not as positive aspects: Smaller portions than other places. The service is slow. Last time I sat inside, I killed about 6 gnats  flying above our table before we even ordered. (I'm a bad vegetarian!) We then asked to eat outside where there were less bugs. This did not happen the first visit so I hope its an anomaly."}
{"text":"Don't miss if you like Thai.  Reservations and Service - I was concerned after reading other reviews but we had a super experience. I called at 5:30 on a Friday and was told to call back 20 minutes before we arrived so a table could be held. I called at 6:10 and was told that we should be able to be seated at or a few minutes after 6:30. We arrived and were immediately seated. By 7 all of the - maybe 9 - tables upstairs were full.   Atmosphere - I liked the cute eclectic style in the old building. Everything seemed clean and fun with mismatched chairs and lamp shades not overdecorated or sleek yet several steps up from a hole-in-the-wall ethnic.  Food - we had an hour to eat and quickly ordered 2 entrees - Pad Thai which was delicious and I think more authentic than I usually see in Pittsburgh with a very light clear (not red) sauce with the noodles almost dry. This is my preferred style of Pad Thai. The Drunken noodles were delicious with very wide - almost square - noodles of the perfect silky texture and generous almost crispy vegetables in an almost clear sauce that did not puddle on the plate. The sauce was a touch more greasy than I would have preferred but less so than other similar dishes I have had at other places. We ordered spice levels 4 and 5 and could see the chili peppers in the sauces - delicious but not so mouth burning that I had to gulp water. The Thai Iced Tea was smoky - lapsang souchong probably - and interesting, the Ginger tea was strong. The quality of the food was outstanding - fresh and well-prepared with flowery carrot garnish. The servings are not large though I'm sure quite calorific - again this is several steps up in quality - so if you are Pittsburgh-hungry then order a couple appetizers along with your entree.  I spied many interesting appetizer plates that look like they'd be fun to share. Maybe next time of which I hope there will be many."}
{"text":"Charming atmosphere that adds a much needed Thai place in Bellevue.  It is BYOB, so bring a bottle or two and plan on a leisurely dinner as the chef makes everything from scratch.  The presentation of the dishes was top notch and the food quality is excellent.    I would recommend having reservations."}
{"text":"Wait staff was ok, but the food was OUTSTANDING!!  I heartily recommend the Pad Thai and the mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"So blessed to have this restaurant in my town. Worth the trek out to Wash Co!!!! Panang chicken curry and drunken noodles (with chicken) were delicious! Joy and Jim are a delight. You MUST try this place!"}
{"text":"If you're willing to put up with the many quirks of the owner, you will have a delicious meal. It may take a while though.  Between the menu full of ingredients she didn't bother to purchase (beef and pork the day I was there) and her inability to handle a group of 8 without constant complaining (\"large groups really should order ahead\"), the dining experience here was a comedy of errors. We sat down and ordered prior to 2 groups of 2 people each. They all received their food before us. Our group's orders came out sporadically between 45 and 60 minutes after we ordered. Some items never made it. When we were charged for the no-show items and pointed out her error, she told us we should have come back to the kitchen and told her. !  The food was good, but Thai Touch on Washington Road in Mt Lebanon is every bit as delicious and they offer a full menu every day with excellent, efficient service. Go there.  P.S. The owner of Thai Suan Thip would not allow us to BYOB."}
{"text":"Really Fresh and great food. Chef Joy talked to me to ask me how my Pad Thai was and I told her it was great! You can tell they use fresh ingredients; she buys fresh food every day and spends the extra time to get everything just right! Her husband hosts and helps run the restaurant. He's a really friendly guy too.  Only thing this place could use is a drink menu. If you want wine with your dinner you have to bring it yourself."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food in the area. We had Spicy Basil Fried Rice and Green Curry. Both were excellent. The owner was very friendly and did her best to get us food on time. Will surely go there again."}
{"text":"We love the food--always we'll executed and flavorful.   They can get super spicy without losing the character of the dish or keep it mild.  The owners are very friendly and work the restaurant to keep it consistent and authentic.  We usually pick up, but like to stay in the cute and inviting dining room when we get the chance."}
{"text":"First time here.... An intimate but relaxed setting. Food was amazing, service was great, owners were wonderful hosts. Who would have thought the best Thai food in Pittsburgh would be found in Cecil. Dont be fooled by the outside, house like setting, you will not be disappointed. Be sure to order the pork dumplings, best we have ever had. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Evidently, Cecil has a burgeoning restaurant scene.  The latest addition, Thai Suan Tip, is no slouch.   My wife and I gave the Chicken Pad Thai and also the Green Curry a try.   Neither disappointing.   Flavorful, spicy and close to home.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quick,  delicious take out meal."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food find - and worth the drive! Joy cooks traditional Thai dishes with lots of flavor and no unnecessary additives - everything we tried was fresh and healthy without sacrificing the wonderful flavors. We had a large group so we decided to try take out, and I called a few hours in advance so she was able to prepare. Make sure you try the Green Curry and basil eggplant! We really enjoyed the meal and will be back. Would recommend it to anyone who loves Thai food."}
{"text":"This place just changed ownership. It's now called Thai Tamarind. Their phone number is 412-766-1899. Hours Mon-Sat 11 AM-3 PM and 4-10 PM. Sunday 4-9 PM.   I ordered the duck curry and my wife ordered chicken pad thai. Our orders came out in 5 min.   The duck pieces were tender though it would have been better without the skin. The pad thai was very nice.   The service was real friendly. Our hostess/waitress is visiting from Hawaii and helping set up the business."}
{"text":"Found this place searching for a good Thai place that was off the beaten path. So glad we saw the previous reviews and tried it out. Really cool place with great food, friendly service and supporting a local business is an A+. Definitely can't wait to come back and bring our own wine since it is BYOB. Don't think twice, go here and enjoy."}
{"text":"the Crispy Cashew Tofu is the BEST.IN.THE.WORLD !  worth the trip just to get this dish!  the chef learned it from her aunt who was the personal cook for the Royal family in Thailand years ago."}
{"text":"I don't usually review restaurants on yelp, but this place made me feel compelled to write a review. I stopped in for lunch on a Monday and was looking for something different. Wow did this place fit the bill. The owner was very hospitable and nice to talk too. We had a wonderful conversation about Thai food. But all of that aside, the food did not need words, it spoke for itself. Tom Yum soup and the Chicken Pad Thai  were outstanding. Very authentic and tasty. I have not found anything in Pittsburgh that compares to this place. If you wanted this quality of Thai food and you wanted to stay in the US, you would have to go to some restaurants in San Francisco or you would need to make the trip to Thailand to find comparable cuisine. I will most certainly be back.... and with friends."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Thai place near me (Peters). Not the Thai food served in Chinese restaurant, but REAL Thai food cooked by Thai chefs. The food, ambiance, and service were outstanding. BYOB. The curry had a complex flavor: sweet on front, heat in back, savory all the way. Some of the best food, not just Thai food, in the area. Highly recommend this place. Will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Based on the glowing reviews of this place, I took my family here for dinner tonight.  I even called ahead to see if they were open since it's around the holidays (yes) and if they were running a wait (no).  So our family of 4 arrived and we were tepidly greeted and immediately asked if we had a reservation.  We replied \"no\" and our waiter went to the counter and studied their book for a bit.  After letting us know that there were lots of reservations for the upstairs dining room, we were escorted to the basement.  It sort of felt like we were being banished for having kids with us, but it was fine.  Except if you count my wife's allergies acting up as soon we got downstairs.  We started with the steamed dumplings ($7.50) and the fried tofu ($4.50, I think).  The dumplings come 4 to an order and they are artfully presented - each in sauce on a small spoon.  They were good but not worth the price tag.  The tofu was also good but not much of it on the plate.  My wife went with the Massaman Curry - I thought it was good.  Considering the amount of food that it was the rice that came on the side didn't seem to be much.  Not wanting to be nickle and dimed any further, we just skipped the extra rice.    I had the Pad Thai with tofu and beef.  The food was good and it even reminded me a bit of my recent trip to Thailand.  But again, the portion size seemed to be lacking here given the price tag.  In all, it was $51 including tax and tip.  We'll probably not be back.  Service was attentive enough but a bit on the cold side.  Food was good but not nearly enough.  Being the only diners in a musty but beautifully decorated basement with lots of Thai knick knacks wasn't my idea of a good time.    Thai Suan Thip gets points for bringing me back to Thailand - but not enough points with service, portion size and being banished to the basement to bring me back to their place in Bellevue."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out.   We ordered the green curry chicken and drunken noodle dinners.  The food was delicious and fresh.  We have frequented many Thai places in the Pittsburgh area and this meal ranks at the top.  We also had the mango sticky rice for dessert.... EXCELLENT"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best thai food in Pittsburgh! Chef joy is very personable and treats every guest like royalty. The Tom ka soup is so wonderful, with fresh lime juice! Amazing! The portions are the perfect size, and the atmosphere is softly lit and comfortable . You could bask in the delciousness for hours! It's BYOB too, so grab a bottle of wine and friends- you be in for a great night!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food I've ever had (compared to several Thai places in palo alto). The ambiance is eclectic, warm, and comforting. Prices were fair. Service was incredible  The food doesn't weigh you down, I left full but didn't feel too heavy. Well done."}
{"text":"Ryan B and I are extactic that this lil Thai gem is a hop, skip, and jump from our place.  The atmosphere is incredible - very warm and cozy.  The owner/host cannot be more friendly and every time we have been, his wife, the head chef, comes out to greet us and see how we liked our meal (something that is a nice treat.)  The flavors and food are delicious.    The only thing that would make me like this place more is if they had bigger portions and brown rice!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in PIttsburgh!  We go here anytime we want Thai food.  It's a small venue, but it's laid out so that you never feel like you're on top of other guests.  Very comfortable.  The atmosphere is dim and decorated with Thai and Asian decor.  Because it's small, I would suggest making a reservation.  The owners are extremely nice and always make sure you're attended to.  There is a lot to choose from on the menu and everything is excellent!  I've never had a bad dish.  This is a BYOB establishment, which I actually like.  Bring your favorite bottle(s) of wine to enjoy with a small corkage fee.  It's much cheaper than ordering a bottle or two at a restaurant that sells wine.  Some say that the portions are small; I think they are just right.  I think restaurants in general tend to serve too much.  All in all, great place!!"}
{"text":"While my sample size of Thai Restaurants isn't more than five places, Thai Suan Thip is easily the best of them.  We tried the chicken pad Thai (medium heat), Thai fried rice with chicken, dumplings, and fried spring rolls.  Everything was delicious.  You could taste the heat on the pad Thai, which was fantastic.  You could also tell the ingredients were fresh.  The best part was that none of the food had any of the overwhelming grease that you get with most Chinese restaurants.  Ordered takeout, and the food was ready for pickup in 20 min.  The owners are very friendly.  Glad they picked Cecil for their new location.  Definitely will be going back to try more of the menu!  Seating was only four tables, so probably better to plan on takeout at peak times."}
{"text":"I travel for a living, I never expected to find such a great Thai restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  From the ambiance of the Hawaian music playing in the background, friendly knowledgeable staff, awesome food, and the owner is sweetheart.  After 20 years of constant travel it takes a lot to impress me but this place is now one of my favorites!  The Panang curry, a yellow curry with shrimp, the wrapped prawns are all excelent!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic and incredibly tasty - this was a gem of a find and when I'm next back in Pittsburgh, this will be a definite stop! The Tom Yum soup was delicious, bountiful in flavor, sweet, sour and spicy - everything I expected and more. I had the panang curry for main and just like the soup, I couldn't fault it - awesome. And to round it off, I had a great conversation with the owner, a wonderful lady, reminiscing about Thailand, food and culture. If you like Thai food, don't hesitate to eat here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect in every way. If you're into authentic thai cooked with fresh ingredients and served in a quaint, elegant ambiance, then Thai Suan Thip is for you. I've eaten thai all over the country and this little place can stand up in taste and quality to some of the finest thai restaurants. Highly recommended. Disclaimer for those into commercialized, westernized, and convenience dining - this place is family owned and run. Everything is made to order, so be a little patient, it's worth waiting for!!!"}
{"text":"I moved to Pittsburgh from Chicago 19 years ago and had been searching and waiting to find this quality of cooking!  My husband and I ordered the dumpling (two orders, thankfully!), the Pad See Ew, and the Ginger Chicken and everything was? delicious.  I am excited to order take out again in the very near future.  YUMMY!!?"}
{"text":"While not exactly a hole in the wall, this was a great little place. Don't expect the fastest service (one woman show waiting tables, behind the counter and handling takeaways too). A quaint little experience. My only suggestion would be decor more slightly more in tune with the cuisine, unless something was lost on me."}
{"text":"I grew up in Pittsburgh, work in Manhattan now, and travel internationally. I am right now visiting family back home and we decided to eat out the night after Thanksgiving. Hoping to avoid Black Friday madness, I thought we'd head a different direction away from the malls and the masses of shoppers. I remembered that Facebook friends had been raving about a Thai place in Bellevue. Well, this is it and man oh man, it is good. Not \"good Thai for Pittsburgh\" kind of good, but truly \"good Thai for anywhere\" kind of good.   Where to begin? There were 10 of us in the party so I got to try lots of things.  I had Panang Curry at a 5 of 5 level and it was spicy but not challengingly so. Next time I will ask the chef to make it Thai spicy but this time I was clearly able to taste how wonderfully balanced and rich it was, wow! My mother had the stir fried ginger and onion, and it was such a pure meal -- she loved it and she is not an adventurous eater.  A wonderful recipe that comes from the chef's mother, we were told. Several people had drunken noodles.  Ok, let's talk about drunken noodles. You've probably had them in the past as a irresistible dish of gloppy, starchy, wonderful noodles with Thai spices. They are different here -- still super delicious but the vegetables are fresh, still crispy. Two people at the table ate this and I could not stop picking at their plates. If you like drunken noodles, you will LOVE these.  This dish told me how wonderful the place is -- so fresh and so perfect, not the starchy indulgence we eat in other Thai places -- not the kind that feel like a lead weight in your stomach. These drunken noodles bring all the credibility this place needs to be truly considered an authentic Thai place.  Wow, if you don't order them just make sure someone else does or order them as an appetizer to share (then fight over).  My sons shared Pad Thai -- a classic wonderfully done here. My brother was eating Thai for the first time and he ate a plate of the pineapple fried rice in short order. It looked wonderful, and would be another appetizer option for a table to share.  My sister-in-law had the Yellow Curry (a mild house special) and her 3-year old was feasting off her plate.   Apps: We had larb pork -- amazing.  Also we had dumplings, which were incredible with a perfect presentation on small Chinese-style spoons. I ate the tofu triangles as well, which were perfectly done. See if you can get your kids hooked on these.  For dessert I had coconut ice cream with fried banana. I will order that every time I go from now on.  What a wonderful place.  We'll go back. If you love Thai, go! If you never had it (like too many of the people at our table), go -- this is the place to try it.  Oh, someone else wrote about the portion sizes. I think they are perfect, to be honest. They are slightly smaller than what you would get in a Chinese restaurant, but they are tons of food. You can eat it all and not feel gross at the end of the meal. If you are not ordering appetizers and you order just an entree, and if it looks small (I don't think it will to you) just order a second side of rice.   Decor, service, all great.  I write few reviews but this one I had to write as I was so impressed. Try it, all."}
{"text":"Believe it! 100% authentic Thai food in Cecil, PA. NO MSG, NO CHINESE VERSION. Simply home made delicious true Thai food. While this place is certainly already well known to the locals (as far a field as Upper St Clair and Washington) for excellent take out, it is also becoming the in-spot for  dinning of an weekend evening and lunch too. BYOB For a limited corkage fee. Khun Joy and her team have an excellent range of standard proper classic Thai dishes, plus a few of her favourites. Ask nicely and you may be able to get something off the menu that you know and love from Thailand (again, as long as it's truly a Thai dish and not some Chino-European  compromise). Kuhn Joy is passionate about delivering the full Thai service and hospitality. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was thinking Thai food in Cecil, hmmm idk, but boy was I wrong!!! Best and freshest Thai food I have ever had. I cannot recommend enough!!! I plan on adding this to my weekly rotation of meals. Great service and BYOB too, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"We pass this little place everyday to and from karate and finally had the chance to try it out tonight.  I love trying new foods and am pretty much a Thai virgin. That said, they were very helpful guiding our food choices. My adventurous 11 yr old went with the steamed dumplings for an appetizer and the pad Thai for his main dish. Both were presented beautifully and delcious. I ordered the Tom yum soup with a heat level of one. I guess in the grand spectrum of spiciness, I'm above wuss level but haven't graduated to a thing more than one (out of five). They are very accommodating to your spice palate and the one was perfect for me.  For my entree, I chose the pad see eaw- thick rice noodles with crisp tender vegetables in a light sauce. I added shrimp to mine and they were cooked perfectly.  We will definitely be back- maybe once the weather warms up a bit for some in though. The only negative for me was that it was drafty in the main dining area.  Do give this new place a try!"}
{"text":"Marvelous food, excellent setting inside and out, owner-Chef lovely, husband and staff attentive and friendly.  Couldn't be better"}
{"text":"The BEST part of our visit was when the chef (also maybe the owner) came to our table at the end of our meal to thank us for coming to her restaurant. In her words, she doesn't want the restaurant to get too popular or busy because then she couldn't cook her meals to perfection with the full flavor!! That impressed our group, the chef and only server really care about the guest's experience.  From the quality and flavor of the curry to the mellow ambience and how well the server explained the dishes to those of us who rarely eat Thai food. They have levels of spice from 1-7 so I found that helpful and accommodating and BYOB is always a plus! It is worth the trip to Bellevue if you like Thai food! Especially good to come Mon-Thurs. I will definitely come back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Thai Suan Thip is the best restaurant in Bellevue.  No question.  The name apparently translates to \"garden of heavens,\" and that it is.  On that note, the outside patio is so full of lush plants I actually forgot that I was eating along that weird bend of Lincoln Avenue that was a part of my nightly walk for most of my life.  The inside restaurant is just one room--cozy but not cluttered.  Great atmosphere all around.  Second, the food is fantastic.  I'll admit it: I prefer less spicy foods, so Asian restaurants can be tricky for me.  But not only did I enjoy the pad thai, but so did my friend who loves red-hot-three-alarm-fire-chili.  There are levels of spiciness to accommodate the most timid eaters as well as those who eat jalapeno peppers as party tricks (you know who you are).  The portions are also very large--especially for the price--so I got a nice dinner PLUS a lunch of leftovers from the entree.  And for the trifecta, the service is amazing.  My water glass was never less than half full thanks to a conscientious server, and the chef was roaming around to check on meals.  Bravo!  Note: Bellevue is a dry borough, so it's BYOB."}
{"text":"Great little Thai restaurant in a small town. The owner was very nice. My curry noodle dish was spot on and very good. The rice needed to be cooked a little more but the sauce was fabulous; however, the pad Thai lacked flavor. My husband wondered if they forgot an ingredient to add to the dish. I gave the review  four out of five stars for my dish."}
{"text":"For my birthday dinner, we did takeout from two great restaurants in Cecil -- the Golden Pig, which I've already written a review of -- and Thai Suan Thip. I'm thrilled to have a great Thai restaurant so close to home. We ordered the dumplings, Som Tum (green papaya salad), pineapple fried rice, green curry and pad thai. We enjoyed everything. Prices are very reasonable and most importantly, the owners were very nice and accommodating. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Best pad thai I have ever had.  Spring rolls were very good as well.  Nice atmosphere, and good service to top it all off."}
{"text":"The Thai food is exceptional and authentic. We bought a few dishes and were pleased with all of them. We were also pleased with how spicy the dishes were. The establishment is difficult to find because there is no sign and looks likes a home. We are definitely ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Super friendly!! Unique atmosphere like family style, you are transformed into a big dining room! The food was spectacular! Favorite thai place in Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"Small, quaint and cozy - this restaurant has a very homey, comfortable feel to it. It was a great spot to find peace on a snowy, slushy, rainy and cold winters evening.  The Tom Yum lemongrass soup was soothing and spicy, I ordered mine at a four, and while I'm a big fan of spice, the soup would have been better for me at a two or three. For my entree I ordered my staple dish at a Thai restaurant - Pumpkin Curry. The flavors of this dish were awesome and the spice level four worked well as I was able to cut the hot and spicy with the rice. The only dish I was slightly disappointed with was an appetizer of pineapple fried tofu. The description on the menu was deceiving, I thought the pineapple would play a roll in the actual fried tofu - instead we were served some bland fried tofu pieces with a pineapple dipping sauce. The sauce was tasty, but the appetizer as a whole...eh.  The service was...okay. Luckily I was out for a leisurely dinner and wasn't in any hurry as there there was only one person working the floor.  Though the restaurant is relatively small, there were quite a few people out dining for a Tuesday night. Plus with the place being a BYOB, having my own bottle of wine at the table eased any neediness from servers. Food came out slowly, but as I mentioned before, I wasn't in any hurry and it was a nice easy tempo for a relaxing dinner with a friend. The server was actually quite attentive despite being the only one there, he came around often to refill out waters and orchestrated the pace of serving well.  All in all, great place. I will most definitely be back. Happy to find a Thai place relatively close to home."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, so it's really hard to go wrong here. This place is small and quaint. Try out the yellow or green curry. HELLO AWESOME SAUCE! But don't stay too long or you'll leave smelling like you worked in a kitchen all day. Oh, and BYOB is always a plus."}
{"text":"First stop here but we will be back. Had the cashew chicken. Delicious! Portion size was generous and prices reasonable. This is obviously. Favorite for take out but atmosphere is very comfortable for eat in. Service was friendly and not rushed."}
{"text":"Simply put.. the best Thai place in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Closest place to find Thai in good ol washpa, and definitely worth the drive. Unfortunately they were out of a few things we wanted and a few others were getting a aken off the menu. But this is a very small operation (staff member wise) so it's understandable.  That said we tried a little of everything soup, curry, pad Thai, fried tofu and I could easily recommend anything off their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I have eaten stir fry dishes from many Asian Thai restaurants and the flavor, spices and quantity of the dishes is excellent. For lovers of top quality authentic Thai stir fry, you must stop in and experience the flavor because you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and this is the first place I had to try, especially after seeing all the reviews.   I kept it safe and ordered vegetable pad Thai for takeout. It had a great assortment of veggies and lots of peanuts on top. A good combination of crunch. However, I felt it was a tad dry. I would have preferred a little more sauce. I also ordered a 2 (on a scale of 1-5) in spicy, and I think I would bump it up next time. But it was a nice large portion and it definitely tasted authentic and fresh.   I'll definitely come back and try something else. They have a great menu."}
{"text":"So Cecil has some of the best Korean and Thai in the greater Pittsburgh area... How is that? Definitely a solid 4 from the Pad Thai, Red Curry and spring rolls that we've had so far. Great flavor, definitely not bland with a home cooked touch. BE AWARE they don't hold back with the heat. Start low and work your way up! I think I ordered a 4 (out of 5) in terms of spiciness and while the spice didn't overwhelm the flavor, it was at the end of my spectrum as someone who likes spicier foods.   They do have a dining room which consists of a few tables and a quaint / homey vibe. We will definitely going back for take-out and to try out more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Over an hour wait for food in a restaurant with only 5 other people eating, on a Tuesday at dinner time. I don't have time in my life to sit and wait this long for mediocre food. They were out of shrimp and tofu! There's only 4 meat choices and your out of 2, insane. This place has only be open for 2 months. I'll try it again in a year if it's still open."}
{"text":"First and foremost..... the sweetest woman and a pleasure to sample her offerings. My birthday pick and not disappointed!  Pork dumpling (I'm usually not a fan....they were fabulous), fried spring rolls(my youngest loved them), drunken noodle (amazing) and veggie in garlic(yum).  My husband ordered the pad Thai and I would have to say if you are a pad Thai lover it was not up to par, but everything else was amazing!  A jewel of a restaurant and a kind, sweet and excellent chef.  So fresh and flavorful!!!!"}
{"text":"Thai Suan Thip is uber authentic and therefore not at all vegetarian friendly, as there is fish sauce, oyster sauce or shrimp paste in everything. The best part about that fact is that they are completely honest about it. For some reason, it is listed as vegan friendly on Urbanspoon...but according to the owner (our server), there is only one truly seafood free entree on the menu, the Rama Shower. The chef (also owner) seems to be very particular and since this is not a spicy dish they do not allow spice to be added. I found my \"choice\" to be disappointing all around. The portion was very small and included a few overcooked broccoli florets and one and a half baby corns with a majority of cabbage and spinach, all \"bathed\" (to quote menu) in a very sweet peanut sauce. The sweetness was a bit much for me and I would have preferred to have had it balanced out with some heat. Unfortunately, my dietary habits challenge tradition. I do not expect all to be catered to me, and some of my dining companions love this place, so I think it deserves 3 stars. The decor is wonderful and there must be something to say about authenticity, other than it sucks for me."}
{"text":"The best. I love their drunken noodle and pineapple fried rice dishes. The owners are a husband wife duo, she is from Thailand and handles the cooking. Cute little place to get together with friends or for a romantic night out... the food is excellent, the prices are right, and it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Top notch Thai food!  We had drunken noodles, basil fried rice and pumpkin curry and were very pleased with all.   Can't wait to come back and try their other offerings"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this gem!!! Beautifully prepared Thai cuisine by Chef Joy and her family. I ordered the green curry- medium spicy and the tofu soup. Both were fantastic and made with love! Can't wait to try everything else on the menu! Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh the pineapple fried rice is sooooo good they should have a branch at downtown."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try Thai Suan Thip this week. I've been meaning to, but they don't deliver, and I just hadn't gotten around to it.  This is a great place to have in Bellevue. The atmosphere is very charming, though personally I could do without the tall tables; that's just me and my dislike of elevated chairs. We were seated right away around 7:30pm on a Tuesday. The place was full shortly thereafter; there aren't many tables, but they do have a nice patio. It's BYOB, being in dry Bellevue.  Service was slow in the extreme, but very friendly. It took about ten minutes before the waiter came to our table at all. He did let us know right away that a few menu items weren't available (chicken satay and something else), and answered my friend's questions about a couple of dishes. Two of us ordered Thai iced tea, which sadly didn't arrive until about halfway through the meal, which itself took a very long time to come out. That said, they do only have two cooks, and the place is so cute we didn't mind the wait.  One friend ordered the Snow Angel at first, but we were informed that you need to call ahead for it as the preparation takes a long time. She went with Shrimp in the Garden instead, which I've seen praised to high heaven in other reviews (not necessarily on Yelp). It was in fact really good, but it's basically shrimp and broccoli tempura with a tasty pineapple-chili dipping sauce. Well-executed and delicious, yes; novel and worth $10, not so much.  I had the tom kha soup with chicken. Tom kha is the one food I would pick if I had to eat only one thing for the rest of my life, and this was an excellent example. It was perfectly balanced in terms of sour, salty and sweet (cookbook nod, anyone?) with a good tang of fish sauce balanced by the freshness of cilantro and galangal. Oddly, there were sweet bell peppers involved rather than roasted chiles; instead, the heat was added by crushed red pepper flakes. Understandable with the ability to specify different spiciness levels, but not optimal. Still, one of the best instances of one of my favorite foods. I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers.  We also had shrimp pad thai, which was again very tasty. The noodles weren't overcooked, thank goodness, and the shrimp were large and perfectly done. The sauce was delicious, though I wish there'd been more of it.  There was obviously a lot of attention given to the presentation of the dishes, both ours and the ones we saw go past on the waiter's arm. The portions were of reasonable size; when I go to Lulu's, say, or Thai Cuisine, I end up with a giant carry-out box of leftover pad thai, but here it was just the right amount for one meal. It could be argued that it ought then to cost slightly less, but I think they're going more for a nice upscale experience than \"neighborhood Thai joint.\"  Given the gorgeous interior, the friendly-if-slow service, and the readily apparent care that went into the dishes, I'll certainly go back. It's the kind of place that would be great for a date or for catching up with old friends. Next time, I'm getting larb, which is another barometer of good Thai food to me.  Parking, by the way, is on the street mostly, and you may have a tiny bit of a walk, but no more than you'd find in Oakland."}
{"text":"The nearest Thai spot to Wheeling, WV so I stopped in. The table arrangement inside is spacious and it's as if you're sitting to have family dinner at your house. That being said, there is maybe 8 tables. I like the open kitchen theme which you can see the chef cook where the cashier is.   Pad See ew- looks pale and different from other places I've had it, but this was still good. Wider noodles than I expected and has a slight grilled taste to the dish which I enjoyed.   Basil eggplant and tofu- as you can see from my picture, this is not simply eggplant and tofu which was unfortunate.   Green Curry- somehow it came out spicier than I expected for a mild but still fairly good.   The way she cooks chicken for the dishes is delicious!   Main downfall - they need help and need to hire another employee for efficiency and better service. So beware if you're limited on time to dine in or even take out."}
{"text":"Very good thai restaurant near Washington, PA.  A little hare to  find, but considering all, worth the trip one time, unless you lived close.   Joy was fabulous, and the seating very homey.  The only reason to give 4 instead of 5 stars is that the portions were very skimpy.  I think I only had 3 pieces of chicken in my meal and it was not very large portion."}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner last night with my father.  The inside of the restaurant is inviting with low lighting, a good atmosphere and a bunch of intimate tables.  As we walked in I noticed that almost every table that had occupants at it also had a bottle of wine, probably due to the fact that this place is BYOB.  Sadly we did not have a bottle of wine but were still happy to be here.  For my dinner entrée I decided to order the red curry with chicken while my dad ordered the pad thai with chicken.  After I had ordered the waiter asked me how spicy I would like my meal on a scale of 1-5 and I replied 5.  He then asked if I had ever eaten there before and I told that I hadn't in a while.   The waiter asked this because they actually added some 3 levels of spiciness above the 5 in response to some customers wanting it spicier.  This got me pretty excited as I love spicy food and I went with the middle of the three levels which was called gas mask spicy.  After only a short wait our meals came out.  My curry came in a bowl with a side plate of rice while my dads' came on a large plate.  My curry had some bell peppers, bamboo shoots, corn and basil leaves in it and tasted pretty good, much like I think all red curry does.  The gas mask spicy was a perfect level for me being quite spicy but not overly so.  My dad also enjoyed his meal as he commented a few times on how much he was enjoying the food and that the spice level that he picked (2) was perfect for him.  What was nice for us that night is we were actually in and out of the restaurant in about 45 minutes although we some other tables with bottles of wine rightfully lingering much longer.   The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future, hopefully with a bottle of wine next time.  Both the atmosphere and the food is good and I love that it is fairly close to where I live."}
{"text":"This might be the best Thai food I've ever had. It's extremely authentic and so flavorful! The place itself is so quaint and homey. The owner does it all on her own and makes each dish right as you order it! No pre-made sauces, no pre-cooked meats, it's so fresh. Totally delicious and quality Thai food for a very low price."}
{"text":"What a find!  Great food.  The stir fry was delicious and the sauce was just right.  ( I should have asked for it to be more spicy.  Good Thai comes with spicey broths/sauces. So go for medium to hot (I forgot to request the spice intensity)  Fried spring rolls were awesome. Peanut dipping sauce was some of the best I have had.   Highly suggest going here if on a business trip(like Me). If you are local or work In the surrounding areas put this on your list!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical but very happy having a Thai restaurant open in Bellevue.  After dining there several times, and getting takeout even more I can honestly say that I love this restaurant.  The atmosphere is warm inside and the service has always been fantastic.    The food is some of the best if not the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh.  If you live in Bellevue and haven't tried it yet, shame on you!  If you don't live in Bellevue it's worth the drive and remember to bring your own wine as Bellevue is BYOB."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but last time I tried stopping for lunch, the doors were locked, and nobody was there.  Checked their facebook page, and I see they now open for dinner at 3:30.  Today my meal schedule allowed for a late-lunch/early dinner, so I called into Thai Suan Thip for a take-out order of Green Curry Vegetables (served with rice) and a Triangle Tofu Appetizer (Served with a Pineapple and Ground Peanut Sauce).  It was delicious! I asked about lunch-time hours, and the sweet woman that runs the place told me that they are only open for lunch on Fridays now, because they do not have enough help in the kitchen, so until they find someone to work, they will mostly be only open for dinner.  Also, she mentioned that she is going away to Thailand next month, so they will be closed for most of the month of May, and will be back sometime in June, so if you are considering coming here in the next few months, I would recommend calling in first just to make sure they are open."}
{"text":"Sorry just wasn't impressed. I love Thai food but have had better. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. They were not serving everything on the menu the day I went so several things I would have liked to order were not available."}
{"text":"Phenomenonal Food!!!! I've been here twice in one week - the food was fresh and flavorful and some of the best Panang Curry I've ever had! The service is also so great the owner/chef is extremely polite and just made you feel so welcome! Totally worth the drive even if you're a bit ways away, you will be rewarded with amazing food made fresh to order!"}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to have found this place! What a gem in an unlikely location.   Driving by, I noted the phone number and called in an order without ever seeing the menu: Spicy Thai Basil Leaf Chicken, spiced at 4 out of 5.  Took my meal to go and enjoyed it at home. Absolutely terrific. My only complaint is that I could have asked for it to be spicier.  I will be back to try more dishes...and I will consult the menu to explore their specialties."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time this evening to order a dish to go.  I entered the decorated front room which felt comfortable and authentic and was warmly greeted.  I went with the drunken noodles and it came out quickly.  When I arrived home my dish was still hot - and what a treat!  My only complaint is I was interested in trying the ginger tea which has so many good reviews here, but they do not have to go cups.  However, I was invited to bring in my own travel mug next time.  I am looking forward to my next visit to try the tea as well as something else from the menu."}
{"text":"The Crispy Chicken dish was the single best Asian crispy chicken dish I've ever had. That includes my travels to Asia. The Basil fried rice was fantastic as well. Great place. Great meal. Close to South Fayette so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Under new ownership and management; it took them a month or so to get their footing, but the place is really great now. Fantastic service, and the food is really solid. If you're unsure what to get, the Crab Fried Rice is some next-level grub."}
{"text":"The restaurant is lovely to look at and the food is some of the best Thai we've had in Pittsburgh.  We will go back but not on a Friday or Saturday night.  We were seated downstairs, which is cozily and attractively decorated, but neglected by the staff.  Our appetizers were very good and hot, but when we finally received our entrees, my husband's was steaming hot, as was the rice for both of us, but my dish was cold on the edges and lukewarm on the interior.  Had there been someone around to bring this to their attention, I would have done so, but rather than wait to return it and then wait for a new dish, I ate it.  It was delicious and I can only imagine how much better it would have been hot.  Our server took $1 off our bill because he thought I was complaining about the rice being cold!  Friends of ours who had a later reservation the same night actually left without so much as seeing the person who pours the water after 20+ minutes of waiting, and they were seated upstairs.  Extra servers for busy nights would be a welcome addition to this promising restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. All ingredients are super fresh. We have eaten at many Thai restaurants, this one is definitely by far one of the best quality. Small business where you can tell everything is made from scratch"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very friendly. Took off a star because they had run out of a bunch of the things we wanted to order :("}
{"text":"stopped here after a day at meadowcroft. serriously GREAT food! i would drive back just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"The food is really good BUT I paid $40 on a meal for two (including an appetizer & two entrees) and we both left hungry. The portions are 1950's style small, which is fine, but the price should match the size of the meal. I'll probably give it another try, but my first impression was meh."}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the wait!! Clearly, this joint is a local favorite, and for good reason! I had chicken pad Thai, pineapple rice, and shrimp fresh rolls. (I was really hungry, ok?!) everything was spectacular! It is BYOB, which is quite lovely.   They get busy and are short staffed (I ti know it's a husband/wife/son operation, so there is a long wait. Be patient, because it is worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time about a year ago. They changed their portion size and I love their food but I'm not paying 13$ plus a tip to go home hungry. It makes me upset because I love their food! Wishing they had larger portions."}
{"text":"Since buying a house in Bellevue, while it's being renovated, I've had many occasions to be in the area, with people to eat with. I'd heard nice things about this place, and thought I'd give it a try.  We walked in the front door, and we were the only people there. The decor is...well...adorable. Antique mirrors and chachki line the walls, lots of old wood, and at the moment, there was a ladder in the back of the room. We wondered if they were open, and a man appeared for a brief second, and then he was gone. I went to the counter, and a woman, the Thai owner, came out of the kitchen and said we could sit anywhere. We started to sit at a very cute little table in the window nook next to the door, and were warned that if people came in and out of the door, it could get cold, so we moved to the other side of the door window which was more recessed and sat at a tall table.  We looked over the menu, which seemed pretty staple, but the prices seemed a tad higher than they needed to be. The server was the hubby owner, a very all-American dad type, who greeted us with the little Thai prayer pose and bow, which frankly, looked kind of silly coming from an all-American dad type. He did it several times through the evening. If he were Asian, then it wouldn't seem so odd...  We both decided on the pad thai, and he took our order, and off to the kitchen he went. He'd left two glasses of water at the table, which was good because he didn't ask if we'd wanted anything else to drink.  One other couple came in while we waited, and sat at the 'cold' table. My friend and I had a nice long chat until the food came.  The plates arrived, and were the big fancy bistroid white plates, square and angled - with not a lot of food placed upon them. It looked more like a quick lunch portion that a dinner portion.  The pad thai was good. Nothing spectacular, but not bad at all. It is just a basic pad thai. They certainly could have thrown on another spoonful or two for the price tag.   After the meal my friend asked for the ginger tea, and sipped it slowly, saying it kind of had a spice 'burn' to it.  She really enjoyed her meal, saying it was perfect, but she's a tiny little thing who doesn't eat much. But as a guy, I really didn't want to leave a meal to look for a meal.  The atmosphere is truly charming and comfortable, but a little 'cold'. It was kind of like sitting in the side room of an old library. Shhhhhhhhh! Pleasant, but it didn't have any kind of spark. The food is good, but there's not much of it, and you're paying kind of hefty bistroid prices for it, in an area that has no need for a bistroid, or the prices that go with it.   As I've stated multiple times in other reviews...I don't care what your 'atmosphere' levels are set at. I don't go out to eat 'atmosphere'...I go to eat FOOD. Never has an 'atmosphere' made me keep coming back. But a good portion of food at a fair price will every time.  Considering the other options in and around Bellevue, I can't say I would never return, but I would have to have a serious craving that couldn't be satisfied with a short drive elsewhere.  I really do think this place could be a bigger hit if they just weren't so skimpy on the portions. I wouldn't mind the price tag so much if I were actually sated.  If you're the uppity foodie type, this might be right up your alley. But if you like FOOD...well...enjoy...but pack a light lunch for the drive home."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered Thai Suan Thip just this week as we decided to drop by Mojo Bistro - only to find it was now a Thai restaurant. This was actually pure serendipity - as I wanted Thai - but Niki's Thai Restaurant in the North Side was not open yet (we went by around 11 and it didn't open until 11:30am).  As it was very early, and a weekday, the place was charmingly quiet. We were treated not only to exceptional food, but also got to know the executive chef!  She came out and explained her approach in making each of the meals.   And to paraphrase, she does not americanize the food by adding \"flour\" and \"other ingredients\" that are not authentic.   The food is amazing. The unique layering of flavors in the spcies and fresh ingredients really impressed us.  We went with some standards (sampler tray, chicken satay) for our starters, and then tried one of the chef specialities.  Being as it was lunch time, and I am/was 35 weeks pregnant, we only ordered one plate to share. Everything was amazing. We left with a full, but not weighted down feeling!  The background the chef provided is that she grew up in Thailand and served in the air force there until 10 years ago, when she met and married her husband (who also works at the restaurant).  She came to America with her husband, but returned to Bangkok for formal culinary  training. Her goal is to bring real authentic Thai food to the area.   The food was so amazing - we ordered takeout just two nights later!  When we picked up our takeout, the place was busy with the happy buzz of customers.  I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant - and I am so glad it's only a mile away!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the hours are strange. Sometimes they are open and sometimes thy are not.  I suggest calling before you go. I had the pineapple rice wig shrimp and it was very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of authentic food and Thai Suan Thip is amazing. We has the tofu veggie and the Tom yum soups.  Both were so tasty and fresh. We each had the fried spring rolls and mine were great being dipped into my tofu soup. For dinner we had the drunken noodle and the spicy basil with shrimp.   The vegetables fresh and crispy , not drowning in sauce, and we loved them. We even got our dishes +3, and  a +4 spicy - each had a great heat without being over spicy.  We are looking forward to trying everything on the menu.  Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and the owners are very warm and friendly.  This definitely going to be our date night restaurant."}
{"text":"In Cecil?!!!! The drunken noodles is a fantastic dish.   The food is incredibly flavorful, fresh, and delicious. You'll feel like you've discovered a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very convenient and despite having found 2 other Thai restaurants that I really enjoy (Nicky's Thai and Smiling Banana Leaf) I thought I would give it a try. The portions are generous and the staff was very nice. Overall I felt that the food was okay, but fairly bland. We enjoy heat with our Thai food and typically order meals at a 7 or 8 out of 10, but despite the increased level the majority of the food appeared to be prepared at a much lower heat level. The highlight of the meal was the pumpkin curry, which did have a nice complex flavor and heat level. I was disappointed that although other Thai restaurants had the Green Papaya salad in season, this restaurant did not. Although it was not a bad meal, there are much better thai restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I got Thai Suan Thip as my first meal moving into the neighborhood. It is extremely authentic, and I met the owners when I went in to pick it up. They were extremely friendly. Everything in the chicken pad Thai was extremely high quality and flavorful. The only reason for four stars is because I would've preferred more sauce on the noodles. I would love to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Follow up to an earlier review:  I have returned several times since the opening of this restaurant, and every time I leave impressed.  As the other reviewers have said, the owners are fantastic people and always take some time to say hello and talk.  After my previous suggestion to boost the spicyness of some of the dishes, I spoke with the chef regarding the spice levels.  Turns out I was just ordering the wrong dish.  Some things just aren't meant to be super spicy!    After a little basic Thai language lesson and an overview of some of the dishes, my standard order has changed slightly and my satisfaction with the spice is tip top!  LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
