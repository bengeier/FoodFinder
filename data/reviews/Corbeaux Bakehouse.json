{"text":"Have been to Corbeaux for both lunch/brunch and dinner, and for their self serve section and sit-down section.   When we went for dinner, it was before they expanded the menu. What we had was good, but the options were limited.   On the self serve side, the offerings look delectable, but the prices are on the high side. $9 for a grilled cheese?!   May go back for a treat now and then, but I don't think I would make Corbeaux a regular stop."}
{"text":"Had never heard of this place,  but was intrigued by the appearance looking through the windows from the street. I have lived in Calgary most of my life and am always surprised to find hidden gems for dining and drinks. I guess this isn't really hidden, but I suppose the semi-terror of driving down 17th Ave commands attention away from looking at shop fronts! On-foot exploration is far safer!   Our group of four was seated quickly and drinks were ordered and delivered. The atmosphere was bright and lively. Other guests clearly enjoying themselves if the level of chatter is an indicator of quality. Server was sharp and answered our menu questions.  I settled on a burger and my other half had the bison Wellington. Our compatriots ordered similar burger and a spinich salad. When the meals arrived, wow! No ordinary burger and the Wellington....all I can say is I misordered! Tastes were fantastic!   As meal ended, we were well full and passed on desserts. Which, I suspect were exquisite! Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Their macaroons are as good as Laduree's!! They have a wide variety of flavors  My favorite is salted caramel and earl grey"}
{"text":"a very cozy bakehouse! one of the best macarons in the city! staff are very friendly and helpful! their baked goods are tasty as well, although the menu items are not that diverse ... and it is also quite pricey for a bakery ... although it's worth a try as a quick bite at mid day or in the morning"}
{"text":"Friends had been ranting and raving about Corbeaux so when I was home in Calgary for a visit I made sure to go in and was... a little disappointed, haha. It was mad mediocre! I was pretty shocked everyone liked it so much. Food and service were below average, my vanilla steamer was delicious but it's pretty hard to make a bad vanilla steamer. Prices were extraordinarily high... $19 for bacon and toast?? Um..  Still glad I tried it! Fun date with my family! But there are far better places in Calgary that won't break the bank; won't be returning to Corbeaux."}
{"text":"This place is amazing - atmosphere and food. The crispy duck wings with the sweet chili glaze are the best wings I've ever had - chicken or otherwise. Also the ruben was amazing and the fries are delicious. You can't leave without hitting the bakery as well. Well done concept all the way around and a favorite in Calgary now."}
{"text":"I really did want to give this place more stars...   I have been in there twice. First time for take away dessert which looked beautiful!  The Blueberry Custard tart looked fresh, but the custard left me wanting... more vanilla?  slight more sweetness??  We were told the layered Chocolate cake is recommended but, then the cake was so dry... Okay, so second go round for lunch.. Impressive looking menu!  We ordered the Pork Tacos, and 2 small servings for $13.00 seemed like a flop when I ended up pulling gristle out of my mouth... ouuuuffff.... can't stand that. Also, the server NOTICED I pulled it out, said he saw me do it, had a face like 'thats unfortunate' The gem ended up being the Moroccan Vegetable soup!  Super savoury, tangy, so spot on with the Moroccan spices..  Will I take my friends there again, I really don't know...  I really want to, as I love the European style concept, and very different.  I hope they improve.."}
{"text":"Update!! The manager reached out to me several months after my first review below and asked me to give Corbeaux another shot as they had made some tweeks. I did and I have to say -- really impressed. Great brunch and great service. They learned from their growing pains and made the right adjustments!! Yummy food!! Great job.  -----------------------------  WAY WAYYYYYYYY overrated.  Service was slow - food wasn't as good as they think it is."}
{"text":"Good food (arguable value) but service is poor. Numerous visits and each time something different occurs from a negative perspective -- some examples: told to move because we were accidentally seated in wrong spot; told we wouldn't be getting service after being seated by the hostess at a counter. Most recently, ordered via lineup 2 sandwiches, a pastry, and two drinks from the bar. Brought the food (included heated sandwiches) to the counter and finished eating everything while waiting for drinks. Watched everybody who ordered after us get their drinks and enquired -- was given a hasty \"computer glitch\" explanation and then had ticket placed at end of queue and proceeded to wait another 10 minutes (total 25) for drinks. Should have asked for a refund. Figured service kinks would be worked out by now but doesn't seem to be the case. Easier just to get your coffee at Analog."}
{"text":"We have been to Corbeaux multiple times and i think the best night to go are Tuesdays for the fried chicken. It was delicious! On the flip side.....Corbeaux has recently started providing the pastries for Artigiano and they are less than appealing. The muffins looks flat and undercooked, croissants and pain au chocolate are flat, soggy and not the typical flaky consistency you would get from Yan's or Manuel's and the cookies have room for improvement."}
{"text":"I love their macaroons, so freshly baked, chewy and the sweetness is just perfect....craving for it now!will recommend Corbeaux"}
{"text":"The interior is nice and trendy looking, I love the sky lights because there is a lot of natural light in the restaurant. The pastries and sandwiches in the display look good but its pretty pricey. I didn't have a sit down meal here I just ordered from the bakery. I had the pistachio macaron and I found the filling too sweet for my taste but the texture was pretty good. The banana loaf was alright. I loved the tomato and bacon grilled cheese sandwich. There was a lot of cheese inside but it wasn't too rich or oily. The tomato was refreshing and the bread was nice and fluffy."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to see that Melrose was taken over by something that's way more appealing.  I was lucky enough to have a light dinner at Corbeaux when it wasn't slammed. Our server was super friendly and gave our party of four as much time as needed to decide what we wanted. Had the pizza ( Apple/smoked chicken) and the bread salad. Both were satisfactory, but for the price, a little too simple, like something I could have had at home. Same goes for the drinks, they charge a pretty penny for cocktails and beer.  I think Corbeaux has potential to up its game and being where it's located , along with the hours it's open, I'm open to going back and seeing how's it's come along a few months from now.  I can imagine their patio will be a big attraction when it gets warmer."}
{"text":"Corbeaux's first month was their best. Now...no great a la carte sit-down breakfast, baked goods come out very late for a bakery and staff seem to be not quite as keen. What happened? There was a lot of excitement in the beginning but everyone I speak to now says the same thing: it WAS great. So sad."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. I miss melrose!  Great baked goods- I completely missed breakfast so that was a bummer. Had their lunch items and was just ok. Overly pricey for 3 people and our bill was 120 dollars with not much to eat.  2 of us are new moms so it was a struggle getting the car seat in and out. Couldn't place the car seat on their new designed seats and was actually asked to tuck our babies under the table!   Likely won't be coming there for a while or even. Likely take out cause their baked goods are quite delicious"}
{"text":"Coffee is good. My friend ordered the croque Monsieur which was supposed to be their signature dish. It was terrible. Soggy bread completely drenched with Dijon mustard, it was gross. Overpriced, poor food, also poor service. I ordered the lamb meatball that never came, the waitress finally decides to check on us after 45 minutes of no food on the table. The croque Monsieur came but the meatball didn't, at that point I told her to cancel the order. The macaroons there also has ridiculous flavors (fuzzy peach and cheesecake?!), they are way too big, over puffed, lack finesse for such a fine pastry."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lunch there earlier this week. The duck wings were terrific. But messy! Restaurant needs to provide finger bowl with that menu item so you can clean up!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, pastries and light lunches.  Fantastic open air courtyard which is awesome on sunny days.  Overall a very beautiful space and good location!  Must eat here!"}
{"text":"I love that a mid-west city such as Calgary has gems like this in it. You're not in Calgary any more when you cross the threshold of Corbeaux. Its a very large shop which isn't European at all but it has a nice (big) bistro feel to it..and the prices are certainly European. I return often for coffee and bread but the pastries aren't priced properly for the quality. Also a nice place to have a coffee date or even a glass of wine. If you like to people watch there are a couple bistro tables out front, and a window bar inside."}
{"text":"Quite an experience. Warm welcome at the door, highest quality ingredients, inventive dishes, outstanding coffee... I want to stay all afternoon/evening and then want to bring some treats home for later..."}
{"text":"GOOD:  I went there with my friends for dinner and the food was great. My personal favourites are the Duck Liver Mousse and the Duck Wings. You should try the Chocolate Devil Cake omg its a winner!!! We shared a piece of this dessert because we were so full after having so much food and wine and this dessert sealed our dining experience. Our server was very friendly and attentive too. But sadly I forgot her name.   BAD:  Me and my friends arrived there around 7:30ish in the evening and the restaurant was full and we were asked to wait for 20-25 minutes and we were cool with it at first. 10... 15... 20... minutes passed and the tall tables got totally empty (we were informed that it was only for coffee and pastries and not for  any other food) and I approached the hostess that night (her name is Karly/ Carly/ Carlie) if we can just sit over there the fact that we already waited for almost 25 minutes... and this hostess was so unfriendly she said NO.. BIG NO! I wonder if she was trained by the management what a poor performance and poor judgement from a hostess. And then we waited for another 8 minutes before we were able to get a spot and it was beside those tall tables that Karly/Carly/Carlie said was only allotted for people who want to order coffee and pastries. And so we started ordering food and drinks and when I looked at those tables behind me... I saw a bunch of people eating the food that we were eating. I was very disappointed and I felt discriminated? Why would she tell us a totally different story?   I am not a newbie in this industry I've worked in a couple of luxury 5 star hotels and resorts and you know sometimes you really have to stand up and make a decision on your own to delight your guests. And sometimes no matter how good your food are and how nice the place is, if you have staffs who are as rude as this Karly hostess girl, people will start to look for another place to eat. She should be re-trained and she should maybe smile more often?   I will come back and dine again in this restaurant for sure because I love the food but I hope to see a more genuine and well trained staff next time."}
{"text":"it was good .. but the price wise little too high for dessert"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and had an awesome date night. The barman and busser were both incredibly friendly! We shared the chicken pot pie which was delicious, and had some really nice coffees. Loved watching the bakers do their thing :)"}
{"text":"The ambiance is very good and the service is good. I especially like the almond croissant! However, if you're into traditional french pastries, this is Americanized. For example, the macaron is huge size (no complaints here though) and the croissant is more like bread texture than layered. My friend actually prefers the bread texture more and finds it less fat, so depends on your personal preference."}
{"text":"One of the curiosities of this week's restaurant - along with 'How do they live with themselves?' and 'Why isn't there a baying mob outside with pitchforks and burning torches?' - is that it should be named after a deity whose followers are famed for their serenity and yet should be capable of engendering in me such a blind, raging, spittle-flecked fury. There will be casualties in the restaurant trade as a result of the current economic turmoil; I sincerely hope Calgary's Corbeaux restaurant is one of them.  I should have given up after the hassle of booking. Not merely the five minutes of thrashing hold music nor the irritating demand for my first name (and my usual reply that I only wanted to book a table, not be their pen friend), but also the requirement that I supply an email address. Why? 'Because it's the only way we can confirm you have a reservation.' Really? So putting the name down in a book, the method that's worked for a century or more, isn't good enough? Absolutely not, for when the email arrives it reveals that any table booked before 10pm must be given back within two hours and that, while there is a bar, they don't guarantee you'll be allowed in to it. There is a particular word I could use here, but I refuse to denigrate the honest pleasures of self-abuse purely to make a point.  The food is that killer combination of stupendously clumsy and grossly overpriced. $10 worth of ersatz French food (Or is it Quebec food?) - most of it  was leathery, greasy and unrelenting. The only contrast came from the chicken pot pie's chicken legs, which promised a little light haemorrhage as the hidden bones punctured your mouth. Worse, and more expensive, was the kinda of lamb served:, speaking gloomily of an Icelandic summer of wind and rain and general hardship: flavorless lamb (Coffee smoked for heaven's sake), gastrique that came right from a cow's digestive juices, and wait - coca scented chorizo. Really???   Of the main courses the most cynical was $27 for a meagre portion of slowly cooked cod, tender but tasteless, then smeared with a pungent - read unpleasant - kinda sauce. In an attempt to complete the tour of Asia we also had a crispy duckling confit, and it was indeed in the style of a crispy duck much as Zimbabwe is in the style of a democracy. The small lobster roll -  for $ 25.00 - were served mixed in with with a Costco version of brioche with fries and a tomato salad on the side. I genuinely do not understand how any self-respecting kitchen can serve up trash like this, at these prices, and still find the will to get up in the morning.  And so to dessert, 'the best part of the meal' as the waiter said. We live in hope, I replied. Only to have it dashed, for Corbeaux is where hope, like the ingredients, goes to die. A chocolate fondue  brought something congealing in a bowl, without a burner to keep it moving, some friable, dusty meringues, a couple of crumbly biscuits of the sort that are served after Jewish funerals and a little flavour-free fruit. Was there anything to recommend the place? Yes, our waiter, who was cheerful and efficient and completely wasted here. Save yourself, my friend. Get a job elsewhere. You don't deserve this. And frankly, neither did we."}
{"text":"had an absolutely incredible dinner here. had the bone marrow with a beef sandwich and au jus. and their home made feature pasta and we were BLOWN AWAY. incredible! they should really bring back the radeberger Pilsner though!!"}
{"text":"I've been there once for dinner and found it to be mediocre. They had sandwiches and I was expecting it to be a little more gourmet in terms in food although I didn't have the other items on the menu. I've been back a couple of times just to pick up some pastries to-go and have really enjoyed those! They have a cute patio and its lovely to sit down and people watch on 17th ave. I've heard the brunch is good so would go back for that but probably wouldn't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Went there for some iced coffee. It has a nice atmosphere, gets a bit busy sometimes but still pleasant. If you're not ordering from the menu you can only sit on these big booth tables or outside, but we didn't really mind. The iced coffee was very bitter though."}
{"text":"Tried twice to dine here. The process for getting a table is confusing and awkward so we left both times. The interior is beautiful and I've heard the chef is amazing. Too bad, can't say we'll try a third time."}
{"text":"Aside from the food being high quality here, it would be difficult to convince me to go back, which makes me very sad.  I had been told that Corbeaux was exquisite, but from the moment that we walked in the door we had possibly the most absurd and terrible (though polite) service I've ever received. It started with the hostess at the front telling us that we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table (even though the restaurant was clearly *half empty*) because they \"just had a big rush and the kitchen was too overwhelmed.\" We ordered and picked up coffees at the bar in order to pass the wait time. After being seated outside (only about 15 minutes later) we were then abandoned with no server coming by for almost 20 minutes more.  Once we chased down the nearest server (one table over) to go get us *our* server, and the explanation we were given was: \"they saw our coffees and assumed we were done our lunch\". Said the staff member who we had JUST walked by to sit down. We were sad to discover that there are two menus- one for indoor seating and one for outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has very few options and not the dishes we had seen inside and wanted to order. Again, the kitchen was blamed (by our server this time) as \"not being able to handle serving everyone the same menu.\" What?? Is this their first day??!?  The food was very good, but for the high prices I expect quality service, or at least, competent. No guarantee of that here. How very disappointing."}
{"text":"The cakes! The pastries! The coffee! It's all good...except: We left town the day Corbeaux opened so I made my husband promise we would visit as soon as we were back in town. It was a no brainer since we really had no food in the house. Despite the late hour for breakfast we arrived to a pretty packed restaurant, quite loud due to the lack of ceiling and box like shape. It was -20 C outside so every time the door opened the cold air came in and I think the heating system had a difficult time keeping up. The skylight, while gorgeous, is also a heat sink. We were greeted upon arrival and told it would be a 20 minute wait. Hubby, who doesn't like to wait proceeded to the counter for a coffee and croissant while I took care of seating details. I didn't even get as far as the cake display and our table was ready so we settled in and waited for our server. Despite two servers calling in sick we felt that service was pretty good, though I did have to ask what type of meat was in the rillettes several times before I was finally told it was duck (good idea to put rillettes de canard on the menu). We both ordered the poached eggs, then shared the Charlevoix cheese, sausages, and rillettes de canard. We also had the Brioche doughnuts with lemon curd to share. Here are the negatives: 1) Everything arrived barely warm. I don't fault the kitchen as the flavours were perfect...even if the server picked them up from the pass as soon as it was ready, the journey through the chilly room would have cooled the dishes off. Even our lattes were lukewarm. 2) The poached eggs, cheese, and rillettes were served with the thinnest slice of bread possible. So tough as to be difficult to cut AND tear. It made enjoying our lovely poached eggs, cheese, and rillettes almost impossible. If you change this bread out...you would have some great dishes! 3) I couldn't figure out if it was 'build your own brunch' or a 'sharing' concept.  If your concept is to have sharing plates for brunch, then the plates should be larger. Adjust prices accordingly. Two sausages for three people is not a great sharing plate.  We ordered some pastries to go and were blown away by the raspberry macaron (and it is MACARON, fellow reviewers...not macaroon!), the lemon meringue tarte, and the two éclairs that we had.   I think that Corbeaux Bakehouse has great potential and a few of the kinks can be worked out fairly easily. I'm looking forward to visiting again...especially in the warmer months when that patio is open!"}
{"text":"EDIT: I have since been back (see review below)  and have had a wonderful time both times. The service is much better. The food quality is still very high, and the pastry is to die for! One of my favourite breakfast places in town, I am happy to say!  Be prepared to wait! But the food makes it all worth it. The menu style is very unique and interesting. Small plates are ordered for your whole table and everyone shares. The food was absolutely incredible. I was very impressed. The only thing that is stopping this place from being my new favourite restaurant was the lacklustre service...  Our whole table felt like we were an inconvenience to our waitress. She gave us very little help, even when we asked for it! When I am going out for expense, delicious food what often makes the experience for me is good service, to feel taken care of so I can just enjoy my time there.  So, to sum it up, even through the food was outstanding, the service left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The food on the menu here was just alright in MHO. But the pastries were tasty! Things like the chocolate chip cookie were very average and what you would expect but the best thing I had there would hVe to be the pistachio eclair! And the service was good as well.  Totally order the drink... Something about a monk - it's great too"}
{"text":"In all fairness, I would give this place a 3.5.   I have been a few times to Corbeaux, usually only for coffee/dessert the products are are 5 stars (I head the coffee is supplied by Analog), although the service is on a 3 - quite often it is sloppy and gives the impression that people behind the counter are not properly trained (i.e. not good knowledge about the ingredients of each product, hard time ringing the prices at the register, etc)..   Although on the pricier side, the desserts are truly appealing to the eyes and tastebuds, so it's a treat to be enjoyed every once in a while. They produce definitely high end baked goods and I have not regretted paying the price when I look to treat myself.  I have also an eggplant sandwich, which frankly did not meet my expectations - especially not for the price I paid. I have had better sandwiches at other bakeries in town. But I have not really made an effort to try anything else from their savoury menu, so I would probably give it another chance sometime in the future.  In all, I think this place has big potential and hoping that as they continue to operate, they fix the glitches they have had so far. I have noticed some improvements from when they first started until now, so hopefully they continue on that path. In the meantime, I will keep coming back to Corbeaux on occasion for some desserts and coffee."}
{"text":"Maybe it wasn't a good day for the underpaid young employee behind the super busy counter, she was verbally abusive with my companion, and had a bad temper"}
{"text":"Update - I've now been in a few times more to give them a chance.  The service is still a bit confusing, but a little more cohesive.  The only food I've tried is the eggplant grilled sandwich - it's really good (make sure they heat it up).  The baking is now looking much less amateur and more professional. Macaron are now all the same size (but still much better at Ollia down the street). The bread has improved. They must have fired a pastry chef and hired someone with a bit more experience.  It's not exactly like being in France, but this is Calgary - we have to take what we can get. The coffee is still the same, so save your caffeine fix for Rosso, Monogram or Phil and Sebastien if you are picky about your cappuccino. So I think these guys have finally found their stride.  It's still not amazing, but at least it's not edible and not a total joke anymore.  It's an okay place to go and get a bit of food if you don't mind paying a little more than you should... but hey, it's 17th Ave - they've got rent to pay."}
{"text":"Decent pastries but a bit pricey for what you get.  Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Always an intimidating cue to stand in first thing in the AM..... The line up moves surprisingly quick though..... Dont know how Starbucks could still be in business with these 2 heavy hitting coffee slingers across the street..... Deliciousness awaits"}
{"text":"I've only been there a couple times but my SO goes there all the time and she loves it. The food is good but the pastries are really why everyone goes."}
{"text":"A far cry from an authentic patisserie but a very good attempt. Nice allotment of in-house baked goods, nice ambience, amazing skylight to keep things light and open and a nice way to escape the drudge of downtown. And their croissant is light and flaky."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfection,from the delightful service to the incredibly flavourful dishes. I would most definitely return here"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  it would fit right into Europe.  Great food, great portions and very creative combinations.  Each item we had was exceptional; Lobster Roll, Duck Wings (delicious), Chicken Taquitos, and Focaccia with pea hummus.    Yes, it is pricey, but it is delicious with a great atmosphere.  We had no issues with service.  Oh and the coffee and desserts are great too."}
{"text":"Good food with various price points for everyone. I enjoyed the atmosphere and I'm looking forward to going back. The macaroons are to die for. However, the layout was confusing - do we sit down? is it self serve? do I go up and order from the case?"}
{"text":"I really hate to rate this so low. Walked in and the hostess was chatting with some people on the pastry case line. We waited to be acknowledged and her response was sorry I was chatting and ignoring you.....WHAT you saw us and said nothing.  As others have said there are two menus. We hit the patio read the menu then came inside.  The server took our drink orders and we also ordered the duck wings. The wings came before she took our main order. The wait was exceptionally long for the food and we both got steak dishes. Steak frites and the steak sandwich.  Steaks didn't taste seasoned ( not even salt and pepper ). Just very bland and not a $28 meal. For the almost $100 meal with tip even though the service was so poor I honestly contemplated no tip. I have eaten way better for less. A lot of pomp and circumstance for nothing."}
{"text":"Great coffee and pastries. Great environment and enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super busy place! For take away I think they could use a better system though non-less everything is beautiful."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Corbeaux. I am the kind of person who plans my weekend based on trying new restaurants and cafes. I  was especially happy to see a new bakery pop up in Calgary. I have been to Corbeaux twice now, and the first time was fairly uneventful, as I only bought some pastries and left. The second time however, was a bit horrifying. The cashier/barrista did not seem to believe that I understood what I was ordering; a traditional Macchiato. After giving her my order, she repeatedly questioned it. \"Do you know what a Macchiato is?\" she asked. Of course I do, otherwise, why would I order it. \"It has a shot of espresso.\" she continued. Well that's why I'm ordering it sweetheart. \"This isn't Starbucks.\" she assured me. To top it off, the hostess had told my friend and I would could sit anywhere we wanted. Imagine our embarrassment when we sat at a table after receiving our orders to be told tables are only for those ordering off the full menu. Silly me! As much as I like French style pastries and the beautiful aesthetic of the place, the elitist attitude the wait staff seem to have picked up makes the whole experience lack luster."}
{"text":"My favourite coffee in the city. Really good food. Delicious pastries. The wait staff act pretty professional.  They don't do takeout. And, my friend and I were sitting at the cafe tables out front, and they would not serve her breakfast out there. I thought that was bizarre."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time and we just wanted to take some stuff to go....WOW! This place was hopping! We  ordered a orange compote and espresso chocolate travel loaf and some pastries and macarons. The pastries were really good! The cheese cake was REALLY GOOD! Macarons was also perfect in taste and texture with a light sweetness, i have had some that are so sweet that it hurt my teeth. I also ordered Madeleines and it was a little dry but ok. The travel loaf was good and moist. Next time i will try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try this place, I had high hopes and as always an open mind. Maybe our problem was that we went for dinner and not the coffee and pastries as most people do who love it. By the end of our dinner i just wanted to get out of there and didn't even have any coffee and pastries.   I too travel to Manhattan quite often as someone mentioned below and the only reason to mention that is that the quality of food is usually unparalleled and should be an inspiration to restaurants across North America. I would say ESPECIALLY so if you are charging right on par with Manhattan prices. I found the quality of food so sub par that our 100$ bill just made me feel super taken advantage of. Ugh not a good feeling. You might wonder did we have a feast and have 5 drinks each? Nope, we (my husband and I) had 1 glass of wine each, one appy to share and 2 sandwiches. I feel that is a lot of money to spend when you order anything involving fries on the side.   The duck wings were good as a starter so nothing wrong there. The 28$ sandwich, however, that my husband ordered was highly disappointing . I don't even know why he ordered a 28$ sandwich maybe he thought it would be the best sandwich of his life. Alas, it was not. The sirloin meat was literally unchewable. I watched him struggle with it and the dipping sauce that was provided and even though he didn't complain, he agreed it was terrible. He eventually figured that if he cuts it into tiny bites he can eat it and not struggle. All the while I was thinking TWENTY EIGHT dollars for this disaster!!   Mine was a 17$ beef brisket sandwich. It was OILY and GREASY beyond all reason and very salty. With fries on the side. I mean, if you are serving a more expensive sandwich maybe put some effort into quality Corbeaux and not quantity. Don't layer butter, oil, mayo and who knows what other kind of heavy mayo-like sauces to complement the salt in the meat. If that is what people wanted then they go next door to Clive Burger and actually have a burger. For 8$. And it is good.   So that was 100$ plus gratuity. Service was ok. Not bad, not great. Took a long time to get that 1 glass of wine which was supposed to be \"on tap\". But that's not a big deal, if the rest of the experience was quality I would be happy to be back.  Beautifully done interior and the dessert/pastry display was all visually very lovey and Sarah Ward as usual did a great job with interior design on this place."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place today...I have been wanting to try it for awhile and really wanted to like this place, but it was a very disappointing experience.   I do not recommend going. Save your money and go elsewhere. It's way overpriced and the taste of the food is not that good nor is the quality. They got our food order wrong and we received terrible service from start to finish. The only thing they have going for them is the nice decor and the sky lighting. Will not be coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice pastry place in Calgary.  Corbeaux disappointed.  Sorry : telling the truth.    If you never experienced a France or Montreal pastry place it could explain why people like it...  I went there twice. Sub par. Not even liked it even with good intents.   Lol my friend and I still think Tim Horton do a better job on the \"red velvet\".  I found the Main Dish in Bridgeland to be way better.     If someone can help me find good pastries/coffee places here I would greatly appreciate!!"}
{"text":"Have heard so much about this place.  Attempted to check it out two Saturdays ago but the line up was out the door.!  Had some time at lunch today, so decided to go early around 1130 for lunch.  Was surprised how busy it already was, but we were able to snag one of the last tables to dine in.  The vibe and layout were inviting.  Lots of hustle and bustle.  Decided to order a cheese, a meat and a salad each.  House made sausage was average.  Pecorino was good as it can be.  The pairing with the meats and cheese could have been a bit more interesting,  My Caesar salad was very bland.  Was supposed to have arugula but was subbed out with spinach instead.  Very little dressing with a sprinkle of cheese and a few chunks of roasted garlic.  Would not order again.  My girlfriend ordered the bread salad and it was amazing,  My recommendation would be to stick with only one great salad rather than to offer one great and the other below average.  Especially when the Caesar is charged at a higher price!  For dessert we decided to try the lemon curd doughnuts and chocolate pate. Both were very good and priced right.  Overall may look to return for coffee and pastries but the food was below average compared to all of the other options available in Calgary."}
{"text":"#131 An extension of Analog Coffee on 17th Avenue SW, I happened by here on the day of their Grand Opening. To be fair, I was on the way to Analog Coffee.  This is the location of the old Melrose Cafe which I always felt was a waste of space.   This is the supplier of the baked goods to Analog and owned by Analog.  First time here did not disappoint. Cookies, danish, and sandwich galore with the traditional Analog Coffee beverage menu. This is more a bakery / restaurant than coffee house though I am sitting in the window as if I was at Analog.  This has a bake shop, butcher shop, cheese shop, pastry shop, and a kitchen. Additonally, there is the bakery counter and restaurant as well as a patio, weather permitting (despite being warm, weather was not permitting today).  Menu prices range from $2.50 (fettunta (garlic toast drizzled with olive oil)) to $27 (beef wellington).  I had my usual mocha in the 16oz variety and one of the peanut butter cookies. Délicieux!!!!!  Full table service and longer hours will set this apart from its sister business, Analog Coffee.  Based on the number of people in here, Corbeaux will have no problems satisfying the masses with in house breads, desserts, and sandwiches. There are different specials for each day of the week.  While I have to run now, no worries, I live in the neighbourhood. Until tomorrow... foodies unite and celebrate!  Bakery open late!!"}
{"text":"Can't lie, thought and expected to HATE it but I have fallen in love with all of their food, pastries... the soup... any I have tried has been heavenly.  I could swim in it on a cold day.  The fried chicken special on Tuesday...so good.  The pastries always have to bought to go because I am too full to eat after I licked my plate.  Oh and the scallop, grapefruit thing going on....wow, fresh...addicting!  Thanks for moving into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Super busy but very nice bakery/cafe to chill with friends, a large selection and good varietion on sandwiches and pastries.  Nom nom..."}
{"text":"AMAZING place.  Great vibe, they could work on having more gluten free options."}
{"text":"5 stars. Because salted caramel cheesecake.   But seriously - on point. Decor on point, menu, service, space. Go here. Do not miss this if youre visiting YYC."}
{"text":"Beautiful location with a great walk-up bar offering a selection of grab-and-go sandwiches and baked goods. The breads here are phenomenal. Bacon cheddar scones for breakfast go great with Analog coffee. I appreciate their queue system of texting you when a table is available, leaving you free to wander 17th or get a coffee.  While the food is certainly delicious, it is quite overpriced. Sampled the chicken sandwich and lobster roll. Both were very well made. Lobster was fresh. Bread was incredible. Salad had a delicious light lemon vinaigrette. And wow, the fries. You must try the fries.  All said, it was a great meal but about 30% too expensive. I don't know that I should be surprised, given that it's 17th. But it's worth trying, and it's quite a pretty venue."}
{"text":"An iconic location but  I think the service and food is a major let down. Just because one has a good location doesnt grant anyone the right to treat customers like shit. after a 40 min to wait because we had a little one they took a other 40 min to serve very ordinary food. I for sure am not a repeat customer."}
{"text":"So, second time into Corbeaux. I went with my best friend this time and it was again, super fun! I sat at the bar this time around and wouldn't you know it, they have cute little purse hooks available so we didn't have to put our bags on the ground.  Our waiter was also the bartender and he was very nice and remembered our entire order without writing it down. He wasn't super attentive though, but I understand that as he had other stuff on the go at the same time.  We ordered the fettunta bread, crispy duck wings (actually had duck this time!) and the burrata cheese to share. The fettunta bread is four BIG slices of bread with olive oil, and it was a little too tough for my taste. The burrata was AMAZING. To be honest, it was probably the tomato jam it came with that I was most excited about, but the flavour combo was very good. Lastly, the duck wings were to die for! Duck wings are my new favourite thing.  Now, we each also ordered an entree to ourselves. I had the chicken pot pie and she had the grilled cheese sandwich. The sandwich itself looked delicious! Very buttery, and the tomato preserve was fresh. The chicken pot pie was tasty as well, but it's a huge portion and the filling was watery instead of creamy like I'm used to.  To finish, I had the milk chocolate profiterole and she had the red velvet eclair. Both were absolutely delicious! The profiterole is definitely something I will be going back for!"}
{"text":"Oh Calgary! I didn't realize what a shiny new gem I stumbled upon this weekend! I was visiting family this Christmas and sorely needed some good coffee and baked goods to relax with. Analog Coffee was jam packed so my bf and I kept walking and found Corbeaux. This place was jam packed too, but we lucked out when some seats by the window freed up.  I'm an avid sit-in-a-cafe-and-read-a-book fan so I still prefer the ambiance of Analog, but all the pastries looked so delicious at Corbeaux. And they were. Oh they were! I tried a sweet croissant and the Everything Oatmeal cookie with a cup of drip coffee. If I were a Calgarian I'd come back to sample all their other tasty treats!  The missing star is for the inconsistent service. The girl who greeted us at the door was super friendly and asked if we needed to know anything about the food. Hard to have questions without seeing the items or menu first.. She explained the difference of the cafe side vs the sit-down lunch side, which was helpful. Seating on the cafe side is really limited, so not very comfortable to linger and hang out, which is perhaps good for their business. However the girl at the till wasn't very friendly. She was more interested in chatting with her coworker than with me. I always make note when I have to engage the staff instead of the other way around. Like when I have to say Hello first. At least she took my order and didn't make me wait. I just thought a trendy place like this would have had friendlier staff towards their customers. Also I told her my two baked goods are \"to stay\", yet she poured my coffee in a to-go cup. Perhaps an honest oversight or reflex?  The overall feeling of this place to me was highly pretentious. I had friendlier human interaction at Safeway, heck even walking on the streets of Calgary, than in here. Even the man I sat next to was awkward and looked like I was intruding on his space when I wiggled into my seat apologetically in a tightly packed establishment. Anyway, I figure anywhere that serves macarons is a hit or miss with clientele. I prefer the hipster cafes in Vancouver when nudging past someone in cramped quarters is an opportunity to exchange pleasant banter.  But the pastries! You win my 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Corbeaux for awhile. I live on 17th ave., and walk past it frequently. Today I had a chance to stop in, and here was my experience:  I wasn't sure if was supposed to order at the counter, or at the table (it's not entirely clear), so I waited behind a guy having a problem buying some coffee. Important to note, there were many people behind the counter, I would assume/hope all with very important work, ...instead of taking care of customers. I was able to ask one of the girls if I should order here at the counter or at the table. She told me to seat myself, and someone will take my order. Great, that's certainly normal!  I sat outside on their patio, and waited 15 minutes. A server came out to another table to clear off some dishes. I waived at him, ...and he looked away, ...fair enough, he had dishes in his hands, but could have easily said, \"I'll be right with you\".   I finally got up and left, walked past the front counter again, and told one of the girls that it would appear no one is able to take my order. What's awesome, is she was standing there with two other girls in a huddle, ...again, obviously too busy to take care of customers :)  Sitting outside just shy of 20 min. with no acknowledgement is unacceptable, ...especially when they have so many employees, ...I guess too busy to take care of a customer.  Oh well, there are many other great restaurants on 17th ave., which I'll happily spend my money in!  Best of luck Corbeaux, you've lost a customer who loves dining out!"}
{"text":"The pastries here are really the thing to get. I loved their brunch when it was the old menu and you could pick and choose what you wanted - the lemon donuts were UNREAL. But now I think it is more set meals which, are just ok. Went for dinner and had the pasta and it was just meh. The spaghetti was cooked fine but the tomato sauce just tasted like tinned sauce to be honest. The duck wings were pretty good. However, their coffee, pastries, cakes and anything baked is pretty delicious. Also they stopped making my favourite thing (madelines) but I hope they bring them back because they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Taking over the iconic Melrose location on 17th avenue, this bakery/restaurant had big shoes to fill, as far as Calgarians are concerned. We live close by and last night twitter lit up, raving about the sneak-a-peek. So, this morning we were among the first to give it a try.   First of all, and most importantly, the food was to DIE for. we sampled nearly every tapas section of the menu- bread, meat, cheese, desserts. It was all fresh as heck and perfectly prepared. The duck wings were orgasmic. I'm drooling!  Since it was day one, there is a lot of service stuff that needs to be worked out, and when I recieved my drip coffee, after a Long ish wait, it was burnt and I had to send it back. So that's why 4/5. But I will be back for delightful food for hopefully years to come. I'm excited to see the breakfast menu!  You should try it out today!"}
{"text":"Showed up at Corbeaux on a Wednesday night for some tea/coffee and dessert. We went straight to the cafe section on the right. The left is designated for their dining room. Selection of desserts was good, however only 3-4 choices for macaroons. I went with the chocolate layer cake, believe it was called a blonde cake despite the fact that it was obviously made with dark chocolate. My dessert compadre went with the pistachio eclair and was happy with his choice. Now..... Where they lost a star..... There were exactly two pieces of chocolate cake left in the display. The rules of cafe/restaurant hospitality dictate that you get the larger piece because then whoever gets the last piece will have nothing to compare to. Sadly enough, Corbeaux does not believe in this principle. We had to ask for the larger slice on the spot. Very disappointing as I take dessert and more specifically, cake very very seriously. Otherwise atmosphere was nice, plenty of seating but then again, it was a rainy Wednesday evening. 3 stars for now.... Onto other bakeries instead, unless I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited when I heard about this place on 17th. I love that they do everything here, baked goods, coffee, restaurant, and bar.   The space is a little bit awkward. I've never been here when it was packed but I can't imagine what it'd be like if people were lined up for the coffee and baked goods, and also waiting for a space to eat. They need to organize that better somehow.   The coffee is great. They get it from next door at Analog, so I'd be extremely surprised if they messed that up. The baked goods are also pretty good. I don't like how things are not priced though, I'd like to have an idea before I choose things. I think they purposely don't show the price tag because their baked goods are somewhat overpriced. The dinner menu was pretty decent, portions are on the smaller side but it was great for sharing and trying a couple of the items.   Here's the only reason I try to avoid this place at all costs. I HATE the service here. I've been here a handful of times and I've found that I have to struggle to get help, and/or the staff are completely clueless about their menu/products, and management was also rude. When I first went for dinner, we had to literally wave someone down just to get the menu. And then continuously so to get some service throughout the dinner.   I also went in to purchase a full cake and asked about the cakes they had on display, and no one working had a clue what any of them were. They kept shrugging it off and saying \"I've never tried it so..\"   The last straw was when we went in to grab a coffee and a quick snack, and there was a guy who seemed to be in a management position that talked to us in an extremely condescending way about staying in line. Uh, can I stand in front of the menu just to read it please?   Corbeaux is really the last option for me if I am on 17th and nothing else is opened, but there are other places opened until midnight therefore other options. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is really neat!  I'm all for the baked goods and sweets. Corbeaux is a relatively new establishment. I have only eaten from their cafe side, and had yummy treats!  The interior has a very industrial feel to it, which I always love! You can either sit and have a full service meal, or come in for a cafe beverage and a snack. Their seating is comfortable, and music isn't too loud. Perfect for a first date! (This was my occasion!)  I would most definitely go again, I need to try all the treats they have!!!"}
{"text":"Loved that I was going to be in the area on the day that Corbeaux opened to the public. I planned to come in and have lunch, but unfortunately, all seating areas were full when my party of three arrived.   We decided to grab some espressos and pastries to go and with the personal assistance of a Corbeaux staff member we selected some pretty yummy looking macarons, chocolate croissants and chocolate eclairs. I purchased a few gift cards  for Christmas, too.  There's a menu that offers daily specials like meatballs, sandwiches and pasta.  The restaurant is modern yet comfortable, but what I really love seeing is some of the behind scenes action as bread and pastries are created. The enormous bread oven is the show stealer being in the center of the action. Jam turnovers were being filled and readied for baking and I was tempted to wait for one fresh from the oven...maybe next time."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now for dinner and pastries and it never disappoints. The duck wings are a must try (my favorite) and the pork belly with the steam buns is a delicious combo. If you have the time the bison Wellington is pretty damn good too. It takes them 30 minutes to prepare it but it's well worth the wait, cooked to perfection and the pastry is so buttery and delicious especially smothered in their red eye gravy! All in all id definately recommend corbeaux. I have not tried one dish I haven't liked (meatballs weren't the best but still good) and Good is consistent every time I have been!  MAKE SURE YOU TRY THE DUCK WINGS!!! \" Read less"}
{"text":"Went to Corbeaux on a Saturday afternoon during lunch primetime and the wait was an hour and a half for a table of two!  So we got in line for bakery takeout instead.  I ordered a raspberry macaron and almond croissant while hubby ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and an americano.  The raspberry macaron was divine. So delicious and tasted like real raspberries.  The outer was cripsy and the inner was soft and chewy. Perfection. The same cannot be said about the almond croissant. I'm a bit of a croissant connoisseur and this croissant was too heavy - not at all light and flaky as I prefer. It was so dense I didn't even get through half of it - and baked goods are my weakness. Hubby's grilled cheese sandwich was delicious. The bread was nicely toasted and had crunch to it. The combination of cheeses and bacon was amazing. I couldn't help but steal bites of it. Hubby's though the americano was fine - he mentioned that artigiano was better.   I would probably go back to corbeaux to try other things (no more croissants) and update my review when I get a chance to go to the restaurant area."}
{"text":"Tried this place last year. Beautifully refitted from the previous tenant, food presentation is very nice, but sorry, what kills this place for me is the prices. Again...whats with unrealistic pricing along 17th ave people? There's a RECESSION on!  Pricy wallet experience, too little food/poor value, won't be back, and im not surprised this place went out of business. Sure it was better than timmies baked products, but come on....I can get many more for the prices they were charging..."}
{"text":"How can I not give a 5 star, this transformation from a famous bar to a French Bakery is amazing, I have only experienced Take out, and it's been lovely, the breads, the authentic French pastries are superb, a bit pricy but enjoying the French experience in Calgary, reminds me of my yearly fall trip to Paris, walking to local bakeries for fresh baguettes and pastries daily. Great Coffees, Great Pastries, Great Experiences, what else could one ask for!"}
{"text":"So, the business owner emailed me and let me know about updates to their menu / portion size etc.   Worth another look!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times now. Interesting menu that I'm still not quite sure how to work so I stick to the desserts and display case. Nothing against the menu, as it all looks delicious, I'm just kind of dumb about what to pair together.  The menu changed today so my favorite dish is no longer offered. I look forward to trying new things though as everything has been delicious!  You can either sit down to order off the menu and have a server attend to you, or you can sit at the windows, communal table, or the bar and order from the display case and pay via cashier. Some of the tables are really close together and share one long bench seat, which is unnerving when arriving and leaving your table, but it seems to be the way restaurants are going these days.   It can get pricey but you seem to get what you pay for in terms of taste and presentation. Service is usually pretty attentive and friendly.  This is a great little bakery for the beltline area. Always awesome to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Was really excited for Corbeaux to open up as it's a really convenient location for me. Well, the first time I went with a few friends and it exceeded our expectations. There's a great ambiance and the décor is well-designed, and the food is quite good as well (I've been to Corbeaux three times and tried their bakery items as well as a sandwich, have not been disappointed.)   The food is quite expensive, though, and after the initial hype died down it feels like Corbeaux isn't what it used to be anymore. The price and the value of the food don't match for me and many of my friends, so we've stopped visiting Corbeaux.   Overall a great place to stop by once in a while for a treat, but perhaps not a good location to become a regular at."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Corbeaux. I have visited maybe once every month and a half since it opened on 17th.   The concept is nice (and so's the massive skylight pouring natural light over the tables and walls) but at the same time it's all over the place. I visit 17th ave a lot and the building's exterior is pretty imposing; its spaciousness is reflected inside the building, but is taken advantage of pretty terribly. The layout itself is confusing, with dining tables on one side of a divider and a counter where you can order baked goods. I'm never sure where you're allowed to sit, so it kind of defeats the purpose of trying to blend the line between an all-purpose hangout place and a formal dining experience. I might try having dinner there one day, but I don't know - it never really appealed to me as a restaurant, so I never think about going there exclusively for a sit-down meal.  If you go to Corbeaux to study, you're basically relegated to the stools by the windows, which is not actually the best feeling, even though it's basically the same thing as Analog. The first few times I went when it opened, it seemed like a fledgling operation, trying to find it's feet - the cashiers by the baked goods were inexperienced and it took forever just to get a chocolate eclair. Having the cashier also handling all of the retrieving, sandwich-warming and whatnot all while managing the till is really inefficient and it definitely makes you feel impatient just watching. Though the eclair itself was good, I don't get a hampering for sweets and their sandwiches often enough to go regularly.   I don't think Corbeaux is the coolest thing that ever was - the execution is actually quite confusing and I have no idea what the areas/stools at the back are for. It just seems like a lot of wasted space and it could be more cohesive.   In terms of the food I've tried, the cookies were okay, but didn't seem that fresh. I like eggplants, so got an eggplant sandwich. It was VERY oily, leaking all over my hands and was definitely inconveniencing when I had to get up from my stool and walk straight up to the cashier to try to find paper napkins. They were pretty judge-y about that (I'm sry???? my hands are covered in oil someone help). The sweets are high quality, macaroons slightly disappointing... but overall, just not a phenomenal experience for what it appears to offer."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hype about this place and this was on my list of place to hit when I was in YYC this past weekend. I was there on Thanksgiving Day for brunch so 2 thumbs up for being opened on a holiday. Ordered an americano misto and it was absolutely delighful. I normally put sugar in my coffee but this cup did not need it tasted great the way it was. Good job Analog coffee  My friend and I both ordered the brioche french toast along with another side of sausage. The french toast did come with one sausage already but we didn't think it was enough. The french toast came with 1 strawberry that was cut up in 4 pieces and 1 tsp sized of whipped ricotta. I was feeling a little bit disappointed with my breakie to say the least as I didn't feel it was anything special.   We also tried the tiramisu and it tasted too wet for our taste. Service was good for how busy it was. Our waiter was apologetic when he could not get to us right away. I would definitely come back for the cool vibe and atmosphere and maybe try their pastries to go next time. Not sure if I will be sitting for brunch again though."}
{"text":"Go check this place out! Whether it's for brunch, coffee or a light dinner, you won't be disappointed! Warm and exciting ambience, friendly staff and good service.  The only reason I'm holding one star back was that all the sandwiches and breads I tried were a bit too greasy.  Definitely going back !!!!"}
{"text":"Walked by and decided to try and get some pastries to go. Already had a coffee from another place so I was told I could either buy a coffee from them or leave.   We left.   Decided to go back and got a prepared sandwich to go and a couple of croissants.  The croissants were good but the sandwich we got (chicken blueberry) had so much mayo and butter on it I had to throw it out.   This place was super busy but I imagine it won't be busy for long."}
{"text":"I am a very picky eater and not a local. I came here for dinner on a Monday night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Somewhat surprised by the low yelp reviews here. usually a three star average yelp review would scare me away. I'm glad it didn't in this case. Lots of talk about it being overpriced but I didn't find it that way at all. If you want to eat high quality food, it's not going to be cheap.  The service was perfect.  The bartender came over immediately to my table and subsequently offered to make me a sparkling lemonade which was nicely done.  I had the homemade pasta with shrimp for dinner and an amazing banana peanut butter maple pastry for dessert.  The pastry was eight dollars. it was so good that I would have paid double for it. I don't even like bananas or peanut butter in desserts!  It was amazing. After dinner espresso was great too. on the spot service throughout my meal. I would give it five stars except for the following:  I think the bar area facing the window on the right should be part of the dinner section, not the cafe section. people dining by themselves like to people watch!  but I wasn't able to sit there since I was eating in the restaurant, not the cafe. also it's a French-ish restaurant with no French champagne on the menu. what the what?!  also, I really wanted an item from the lunch menu for dinner but they didn't offer to make it for me. a five star restaurant would have offered.  nonetheless I'll be back next time I am in town.  hoping this place is still there. that is all. :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a drink on a very hot day after walking 17th Avenue.  Our server was absolutely awesome.  She suggested the perfect drink for what our thirst was wanting - the Hanky Panky.  It's a lager with lemoncillo, apricot brandy and grapefruit juice.  It was delicious!  We then had some Crispy Duck Wings in a sweet chili sauce and a Grapefruit Mojito.  Again, just perfect!  It was a nice afternoon in the sun!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the concept of Corbeaux (bakery/bistro) but the food really hasnt been very memorable. Corbeaux is beautiful, that's undeniable. Reminds me so much of bistros back in Montreal. The menu is interesting but the food is honestly a bit one note. Still, not a bad way to spend a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Corbeaux is one of my favorite places in the city. They have delicious food and coffee of course and the staff are always the nicest! Great atmosphere- will definitely recommend and return (like every week!)"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times. We first tried their brunch. Our server seemed very new and wasn't sure how to enter in our orders on the iPad. We had to repeat our order a few times but it was all good. The food came quickly and all tasted amazing! Bread was really good! Scrambled eggs and waffles too.  Our second visit was for the pastries. We had the almond croissant and the lemon curd danish. My new favourite.   We want to try dinner next time and I'm sure we won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Corbeaux Bakeshop is located on uptown 17th avenue SW where Melrose Café use to be.  According to my French gf, Corbeaux means crow or raven and it is pronounced Korb?.  Amanda and I were due for a catch up and we both wanted to try Corbeaux so we planned for a visit Sunday afternoon.  It was around 3PM when we walked up to Corbeaux and there was a long line.  We just decided to go with the flow of the crowd.  Confused, I asked the couple ahead of us if they knew how the system worked because all I saw was a line passing the display of sandwiches and pastries, I wasn't sure how we got a seat and if we were going to get one.  They were unsure as well.  There was a host up front which didn't seem to be doing anything but standing there, so curious me went to ask her a few questions.  I was told that the kitchen is closed and the seating area is first come first serve until 5PM then the kitchen opens after 5 and they start seating people restaurant style (not sure if this is only during weekends).  I think she mentioned that the window seats are for people just ordering from the bakeshop during 'restaurant' hours.  We first passed the display of sandwiches and croissant-wiches, cinnamon buns, cookies and then next a display of beautiful cakes, tarts, eclairs, and macarons.  While we stood in line, we were offered a fresh cinnamon bun sample which was nice.  \"Have you been helped yet\" says a girl peeking over the display - she then takes our order.  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and bacon and a carrot cake with a London fog.  Amanda ordered a croissant-wich with cheese and different cuts of meat, she also got the lemon tart and some madeleines and macarons to go.  There was a bit of confusion at checkout because they didn't remember who ordered what but we got it sorted out.  My three items came out to $21.  Lucky for us, by the time we paid there were some tables available so we got to sit down.  There is a station where you can your coffee lids, utensils, plates, napkins and water is even free.  My grilled cheese was good, it was hot and the cheese was stringy.  The bread was nice, it had kind of a croissant texture but it wasn't anything to phone home about.  The carrot cake was good, there was a white chocolate layer on the bottom which was tasty but I found that there wasn't much cake in the carrot cake, it seemed to have more cream than anything.  My drink was the same as if it was from any other coffee shop.  Amanda on the other hand, her croissant-wich wasn't hot and the cheese wasn't melted.  I told her to go up and ask them to reheat it but she didn't want to bother.  She really enjoyed the lemon tart though.  Don't get me wrong, although quite pricey, Corbeaux is one beautiful place but I feel it just needs more time to settle.  With some organization, instruction and customer attention right from when they walk in the door, I think Corbeaux has a lot of potential for success.   Because sure you can have pretty pastries but you need some kind of flow, you don't want to be known as the fancy cafeteria with no flow..  Maybe dining during the restaurant hours is a different story but to me it was confusing right from the gecko.  I'll give you another try Corbeaux."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has come a long way since it initially opened last year! The wait has been very much reduced (maybe everyone is out of town cuz it's summer?), and the menu is now no longer a-la-carte. The meals have always been pretty good here, but the last couple times we've been blown away! If you try just one thing for brekkie, make it the brioche french toast. Not only is it brioche and french toast, but it's ever so briefly deep fried to make it just a little crispy all over. Seriously, it's like doughnut french toast; amazing.  The 3 star rating doesn't match what this place has become, do yourself a favour and check it out!"}
{"text":"The food was great, we stopped in for lunch and picked up a few treats to take home. The menu had lots for options and is set up so you can pick just a few things to nibble on or have a full lunch. Great set up for sharing so you can try a little of everything. The only downside was they do not have high chairs, the reviews say kid friendly which is true if your little ones can sit well on their own. But was tricky to manage with a 9 month old."}
{"text":"Ignore the negative reviews - it only takes a couple of minutes to look at their other reviews and see they're either serial 1-star reviewers or think Boston Pizza is worth 4/5 stars!  The dinner and drink menus looked so good that my partner and I nearly cancelled our plans and asked for a table. Instead we (regretfully) stuck to our plans.  The coffee here is supreme, the takeaway sandwiches are great and creative. The sweets, however, my god. The pastry, the ingredients, they're all delightfully balanced. Never too sweet - just right.  The service was friendly, attentive and accommodating. Better than most establishments in Calgary.  Do not skip this place because of ludicrously unjustified 1-star reviews. Try it for yourself and be impressed."}
{"text":"First of all, from a French-speaking person, you guys need to know that \"corbeaux\" means \"crows\". My review will follow a similar theme of the contrast of what is presented versus what is actually experienced.  The place looks great. To whomever designed the joint, excellent work, A+, looks great. The tiffany blue bags and boxes are an especially nice touch.   The food is also pretty good. I had a vegetarian sandwich, some macarons and coffee. Sandwich was good. Coffee was tasty (but it's hard to mess up drip coffee). Macarons were not the best I'd had but they were good.  All in all, I walked in expecting something pretty great. And yet ...  The service makes zero sense. You line up for food, and pick and choose things from the counter. Things are displayed attractively, but without the price. It's all guesswork. Guys, this isn't a Portlandia sketch. This is real life, and I want to know how much my red velvet eclair is gonna cost before I eat it.  It's not clear how to order. I got the impression that I had to order and pay with the same server, but that whole process also got confused. I apologized and said I still hadn't ordered my dessert and wasn't sure who to speak to, and the server who had been helping me sighed and seemed a bit ticked off. Now, I'm not the type to call her \"unfriendly\" because this place is total chaos, and I'm sure it's not her fault. She's probably way more stressed than I am. Didn't bug me that much. it was just an inconvenient process.  After my little group had ordered everything, we brought our number back to our table to wait for our food. We were confused because we had to wait at the table for our food, but had to go up to the counter for our coffee. Very weird.  So here are my suggestions: - The biggest suggestion is hire a restaurant manager. Or get on one of those \"save my restaurant\" reality shows. The people who work for you are clearly stressed out and frustrated, so make their lives simpler and easier, and it won't be this confusing environment to navigate. - Keep it simple: stay in or take out. None of this ordering food to stay in and praying to your god of choice that some seating will open up. Take reservations, have a take out counter. That's it. - If you're going to have table service, why have people line up for food to take it back to their tables? Menus. They're great. Use them all over. - Signage. Tell people where things are. We all like to think we're smart enough to find a bathroom, but lord knows we're not. - Put your prices up. I've seen $10 sandwiches that look like trash, and these look great. But please for the love of all good things tell us how much it costs. - Use a takeout order system that makes sense. Maybe cute little order forms and golf pencils. You can even brand them. That way, you hand your little paper in, pay for everything, and wait however long it takes for it to be assembled.   Would I recommend this place? The food is tasty but the customer service end is terrible. Show up with a lot of time to kill. And expect what you'd expect from a restaurant called \"Crows\"."}
{"text":"Giving u a 2nd chance, failed again!  Short version: Not experienced staffs mess up the arrangement. Very unorganized! Food is too salty. Service is slow. Pay machine automatically set up 18% tips! Do not know how much the cakes, breads, macarons and sandwiches are as they do not show the prices.   Long Version: My friends wanna have lunch there, so we arrived around 11:20am.  They locked the main door, and everyone needed to get in from the patio door. It was not convenient, especially we had a baby and baby stuffs.  When we got in, there's no line up, but the host said we needed to wait for 25-30min; in fact we saw an empty table that the host did not even know. So we told him, and he said he would prepare that table for us. We waited for quite a while, still were not taken to the table. Then we saw few diners who sat at the booth were paying the bill, so my friend went up and asked if we could sit at the booth instead because it's safer for the portable hight chair for my friend's girl. So he said okay and would take us to there once it's ready. But waited for a while, and all the sudden a lady (hostess/manager) took another group of diners to the booth that the host assigned for us!!! Then both of my friends needed to talk to the host again(again!!!), and at the same time we noticed the lady who gave our table to the other group promised to give the same table to another group of diners!!!!! what a mess....... So the host apologized to us, then moved that group of customers to another table. But still no one taking us to the table!!!! OMG!!!! Then my friend asked a waitress if the table is ready for us. She said we needed to wait until we received a text message!!!! Seriously!!! we were just there, they could not tell us, but we needed a confirmation message?!?!??!!?!?! Finally, we got the table. My friend ordered a hot chocolate. But it had no chocolate taste, just like milk with a bit color. We ordered 3 french onion soup, black cod, bread salad to share.  The french onion soup and the bread salad were salty, no good. The black cod was okay. But since we had the very salty soup and the salad before the fish, my friends found the fish was lacking of flavour.  This is the first time my friend tried this place, and we both think it's chaos, and nothing special! we are not going back."}
{"text":"Should I give it a three, nah, maybe a four.  I am attracted to these places. Like cute little cafe places with fresh bread and high ceilings. OH AND BREAKFAST! How European.  I know it is because I fit somewhere into the target market that no doubt was fruitfully and lavishly researched before the investment conglomerate decided to build in this very expensive location.  French bakery in Calgary. Whatever. Croissants are good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. Their lattes were good, but nothing to write home about. Their danish/pastries and pizza were OK. The space is aesthetically pleasing. That's basically the best part about Corbeaux. We sat inside by the window and there were a million flies and dead bugs. Ordered for stay and our pastries were for stay while our drinks were given in to-go cups. Staff is very friendly. Disappointed that they did not have wifi."}
{"text":"Ok I think giving 3 tries is enough to safely write a review that reflects this business.  If they ever get their service model fixed I might go back.  The last visit was the last straw for me, I was so mad when I left.    Went for dinner in 17th and thought it would be great to do coffee and dessert at corbeaux.   No that's a bad idea!!!!  The 3 of us go in and go straight for the beautiful dessert counter.  We order 3 desserts, 1 regular coffee and 1 soy latte.  Seems simple, I think.  Well when we went to sit down we were told we were not allowed in the main seating area as we did not order properly.  Wow $35 worth of food and coffee seemed like a fair order.   We were told we would have to sit at the counter long tables.  Well there was no room. So there we stood like idiots with plated desserts And 1 coffee, soy latte well that took 18 minutes.  Please note there were tables available in the restaurant.  So we found a spot by the bar, we saddled up relieved to find a spot.  Not so quick, the bartender told us we were not welcome to sit there either, another menu ordering only spot.   We landed on 3 spots looking into the kitchen. Well when we finished our desserts my soy latte came.  Asked for it to go....  Corbeaux is a no go for me."}
{"text":"Stopped on by to see what the old Melrose has turned into and wow I am impressed with the new addition to Calgary's restaurant scene. As expected with a new restaurant opening on 17th it was utter chaos and packed with people. We had wait for about 40mins for a table and service was quite slow once we sat down but as a new restaurant they have some kinks to work out. The food on other hand was worth the wait.   The open kitchen and bakehouse was a wonderful way to make the space more interactive and spacious. Who doesn't like to see what the chefs are doing and how your food is being prepared.   On the way out I grabbed some macaroons to go and see if it comes close to yan hautes and I can say that they sure come close in my opinion. Larger than yan's but just as fluffy and fruit filling depending on which ones you get. Definitely a must try new addition to Calgary's food scene"}
{"text":"I feel like the only reason people rate this so high is because it's trendy. The place is crazy packed. 2 hour waits, all the time. Which is expected for something on 17th, but the hostess let her friends go before us!  She said its \"because they had a smaller party\" but there was 2 of us soooo don't see how that works out. It's also crazy overpriced. 3$ for 1 macaron?! I got 4 macaroons, one piece of cake, and a small chai and it was over $30. Insane! But I guess you can price whatever you want when you're popular on social media.  If you're down on 17th, check out the many other places for food. Just snap a picture of the outside and say you went, your Instagram followers won't know the difference (and you'll save a ton of cash)."}
{"text":"The real rate for me would be 3.5 stars ... The service was excellent!! Super friendly and on time!! Nothing to complain... The drinks were good too... I tried a few cocktails and I liked them. The food was ok... Not bad; but I would expect something better from this place... The ambience was cool and the place is beautiful ... In my opinion they still have room for improvement in the food..."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and plentiful but if you've got 15 workers standing around, they should focus less on hugging and high fiving each other and more on letting the bartender get drinks out in a reasonable time.    The duckling buns are the only thing that saved my review from a 1 star.  Tighten up appetizer and drink arrival times and empower the staff to be proactive about meat wellness levels.  I'll put up with terrible value but not $29 for two pieces of lamb when one piece was blue on the inside.  Considering how long it took for service at 5:00 on a Sunday, it just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"I don't really understand this place, but that almond croissant I had this morning was delicious. Best I have had in this city.  But, I don't get it, do they do brunch? Is there table service? We came in at 10ish this Thursday morning, and there was no hostess, so we got in a line, and paid $19 for 2 almond croissants, a cinnamon bun and 27 ozs of coffee. I saw a paper menu after we had ordered, but it was more of an appies and evening plates thing,  By the time we were leaving, a hostess had appeared, so is there all of a sudden a new secret menu available? It's very pretty in here, and I spied a wine bar area in the back corner, but really folks, if you think you MUST COME HERE, and that THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE, I really don't think it is.  Don't queue for 3 hours on a Sunday for some brunch that may or may not be available, but stop by if you can midweek for a pastry and coffee.  Give me some more direction Corbeaux, your space needs it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Canada Day wanting to check the place out.  They have a beautiful interior, and a large patio.  Unfortunately when we were seated they said the patio was closed, and not even two minutes later people were being seated there.  Kind of annoying, considering inside the tables are so close together you are practically part of the conversation of anyone next to you.   No biggie, the service was fairly prompt and the interior decor was very interesting to look at.  I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with a side salad.   The dressing on the salad was like a citrus vinaigrette which was very fresh and tasty.  My sandwich had a beautiful balance of flavours with the sesame seeds on the brioche bun and the cucumbers on the sandwich, it almost had a pan-asian taste palette going on.  It was delish!      Overall, the experience was pleasant, I just wish they would have had their act together in regards to the patio.    The prices were high, but with homemade bread, and the quality of the food we definitely didn't mind paying that little bit extra for sandwiches.    I snuck a few fries from my husband's plate and they were incredible."}
