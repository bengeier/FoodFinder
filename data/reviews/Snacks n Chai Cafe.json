{"text":"Loved this place. Kashmiri chai, regular chai and chicken puffs, were amazing. Club sandwich was ok. Burger was good. Good ambience and nice location."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try today. The food, frankly,   is mediocre. I had the samosa and chick pea (which is basically a chaat masala). It wasn't bad but I've had better. The chicken paratha was similarly mediocre and had little flavour. The masala chai was pretty good. What really bugs me about this place is that I got served my food in a paper plate and chai in a paper cup. Not only is this so bad for the environment, it just feels cheap. Don't think I'll return to this place again and wouldn't recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and my first impression from walking in is to turn around... the menu is small and the place is empty. Dead empty.  I placed my order at 12:10pm thinking it wouldn't take long.... I was so wrong. I recieved my order at 1pm. Very disappointed.  I ordered: Stuffed Paratha with potatoes...4.95 SnC Burger with cheese....6.95  Cookies & cream milkshake...4.95 Veggie samosa...0.75 (I got 2)....1.50 Tip 10% Total: 22.79 after tax.  So prices are not bad.  Let me start this off by what I tried first.  Milkshake was really good. I didn't think they would mess it up. 12oz for 4.95 not bad. More pricey than some places I have been but ok.  The burger is tasteless and gross. McDs burgers are better and I avoid going there at all cost. Score 0/5, NEVER AGAIN!!!  Potatoe Paratha - good size for the price. I could barely eat it as it was hotter than hell! I asked for mild I almost died.   Samosa - thinner than im use to but not a big deal. Same thing asked for mild, hotter than hell.  If you like spicey food this is for you just stay away from the burgers.  For time and the burger they lost 2 stars from me. Time is a big thing especially during a work day. People expect fast service duringlunch hour. All places in Courtneypark Plaza know that, even Montana state has a fast menu.   I will not be coming here again.  Till next time. Xoxo happy eats."}
{"text":"Everything I tried was v good- hunter beef burger, kabab paratha roll, crispy burger and bun kabab. Service was pretty fast and the food was hot fresh and tasty. I can't think of a reason to give less than five stars based on the food and service."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place is awesome! I could not wait to put the location on yelp as soon as I had the first bite! Voil√† this is how it was added in to your yelp community.  This place recently opened up Courtney Park Plaza where Helmand's Kabob - Afghan Cuisine used to be. It was a good plaza I don't know why it closed. The size of the place is quite good and can seat 40 to 45 people easily.   The service was good and people were friendly. You have to go up to the till and order, they call the number once the food is ready.  This shops is more of a Sandwiches and Chia corner shops which are present in Pakistan. Hence, it brought back lot of good childhood memories. I went wild on the menu and as we were bunch of people I get to try quite a few things.  Lets get down to business. The first thing which caught my eye was the club sandwich and I believe its been more than 15 year since I had something similar to this. The sandwich came with fries and coleslaw, it was full of goodness.   Then came the crispy chicken burger...it was so good! the spicy mayo hit the spot. The burger size was great for the price. I also tried there Paratha roll and that was quite spicy and If i could handle it then it extremely spicy for an average Joe!  Then I has the Kashmiri Chai which was to die for, the best I have had in North America so far. I also tried their Zafrani Chai which was very good as well.   Overall....I love the place! I have to go back and try their beef burger. The portion size is good as well.  For my Muslim Brothers and Sisters... This place servers Halal food. The owners have stated on the FB page that \"Everything we prepare is Halal. We buy chicken from Sargent farm and beef from Indo Pak Grocery Heartland Mississauga.\""}
{"text":"Order: kadak chai, chaat masala, chicken paratha Went here recently on a weekend morning. We just happened to come across it, and all of a sudden had a hankering for desi/Pak-Indian food and chai. First off the service is a bit lacking. That said the food was OK, not amazing, decent portion, but the chai was good. We essentially got a small meal or snack able items for about $15. Again nothing spectacular.  Aside from the issue with service (servers were not attentive and we often had to ask again for things or do it ourselves), a big issue was the fact that everything was served in paper cups, plates and styrofoam containers. That included those who dine in (as we did). It made it seem a bit cheap, and definitely made me question environmental consciousness, given the wastefulness (which should be easily remedied).  My advice: this place is not bad for some authentic Pakistani chai, but not much in the way of food and service.  Also, be weary of suspicious reviews from others here. Some seem to be overly positive (one in particular) and lack credibility."}
{"text":"I waited one hour for three cups of Kashmiri (pink tea). After 50 minutes of waiting and intermittently checking on my turn, I walked up yet again to the counter this time determined to cancel my Oder and just leave. However they said it would only take 5 more minutes and since I had family waiting at home for the chai I decided to wait it out so that no one was disappointed in me coming home without any chai. I rushed home after getting the chai and unfortunately the first sip of the chai was horrible! I tried to drink some more because I waited so long for the chai but it was truly undrinkable! Probably the worst Kashmiri chai I've had in GTA. The drink was basically water and ... I can't even understand or figure out what they could've put in the chai to make it taste the way it did. I didn't try any of the other menu items but definitely will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"We ordered the club sandwiches, beef paratha rolls and rabridi falooda.  Everyone loved all the items.  Freshly made and quick service.  We will be going back for sure for more snacks!!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely wonderful, as is the setting. My main concern with this place is the service. I have been here about 4 times... and every time the disorganization amongst the cashiers/ servers is quite prevalent. Every time I have gone I have only ever been served by young and confused people. On another note though, their kashmiri chai, paratha rolls and club sandwiches are definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious Pakistani fast food! Passed by and thought I'd give this place a try since their exterior seemed quite inviting. I tried their chicken paratha roll and holy moly it is scrumptious, the green chutney adds a nice subtle kick to the tender chicken, the paratha bread is not greasy and is crispy on the outside and slightly flaky while soft on the inside. Their portion size is quite generous compared to other Pakistani/Indian fast food joints. They also have Pakola, which is hard to find! I will be returning to try their burgers and tea, they have quite a selection.  The price point one roll is $5.99"}
{"text":"One of the best karak chai in Mississauga. Very friendly owner. Their club sandwiches and beef burgers are also very good."}
{"text":"I went in for some dessert and ordered the Kulfi Falooda with Rabdi. It was amazing, I wasn't expecting it to be so good. I loved every bit of it and would have ordered one more if I wasn't too full.  The service was great and I will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Bought the crispy chicken burger here. For the first time in my life, I wished I was vegetarian. It was so bad. It tasted like oil. Didn't taste the chicken at all. It tasted as if they haven't changed their oil for weeks. Not going back. I wish I never came to begin with."}
{"text":"How does a place that has Chai in their name have bland Masala chai with zero kick. Pretty disappointing.  Maybe the other stuff on the menu makes up for that, but I won't ever know."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Pakistani mix tea   This is the place for it. They have some nice variety of sandwiches and burgers"}
{"text":"TIP:-Best Karak chai in GTA by far!Didn't try anything else but good karak chai is rare to find and this place has it so it's won my heart!Will review in detail once I eat here!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to get traditional chai (vs a Starbucks \"chai latte\") and wow was I disappointed :( I asked the cashier for recommendations on the different types of chai since I don't recall what type I've had, but I explained the kind I like had cardamom and spices in it. So she recommends ...the Karak chai. ?? Wrong! The Karak chai was basically dirty water with no taste and oh, THERE WAS NO SUGAR in it (!?). Am I the crazy one or is every chai already made sweet (hence the reason I like chai so much - I don't have to add anything to make it taste good as I do with coffee).  I was going to give them a 2nd chance and order masala chai after I discovered what the karak chai was, but when I asked if that came sweet, the cashier said \"none of the chai are sweet - you have to add sugar\".  Oy vey. Needless to say, I did not order the masala and instead got a strawberry lassi; the lassi was very tasty but nothing to write home about.  So as far as chai - this is a 1 star.  They get 2 stars for a good lassi and having more than just mango flavor.  I did not try any food so I can't comment on that aspect.  As far as ambiance, the precious reviews are accurate: be prepared for it to be dead/quiet inside, very few items on the food display, and the only menu displayed is the one sitting on the counter."}
{"text":"This place is quality.    I only had a small lunch.    They should do some local advertising to let people / businesses know they are there."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience here. Poor customer service, subpar quality food and the prices were far too high given the poor taste and quality in the food. Not to mention the fly which was buzzing around and constant noise from staff shifting the tables around. I can only speak from my own experience and thats what im sharing. I personally would not return here."}
{"text":"3.5 - 4 stars. Decided to give this new cafe a try tonight after a couple glowing Yelp reviews and I agree that it's good. It's located in the Cineplex Courtney Park complex.   The menu is comprised of snack-type foods, such as burgers, sandwiches, puff pastries, etc that are catered to South Asian tastebuds.   My husband and I shared the chicken club sandwich (came with fries and a small coleslaw), hunter beef burger, and chicken/cheese sandwich.   This is not gourmet food by any means, and I wonder which items of the menu are freshly made vs. which are purchased/bought frozen etc, but the food I ordered was tasty and satisfying. I'd be happy to return and have any of the dishes I had today again, especially the hunter beef though it would be better with more beef (todays' bun:beef ratio was off).    Husband tried the mango lassi and said it was average - he regrets not ordering the kadak chai which is apparently really good. Next time ;)"}
{"text":"Had a fruit fly in my chai. No apology even offered.  Seems to be non Chalant about this issue. May be an epidemic and have had other customers with fruit flies previously. Would be very careful returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Nice place & Quick Service.  Tried Crispy Chicken, Bun kebab, Chicken Paratha roll & Chicken Mayonese.   Crispy Chicken was my favorite, tasted really good, a bit spicy but will try again n again.   Service was quick, the only issue no staff were on the floor cleaning tables etc, everyone was behind the counter or in kitchen.but overall fantastic place for fast food lovers."}
{"text":"It sucks !!! waste of money and time . Food is pathetic , I ordered club sandwiches and hunter beef burger . The club sandwich had hardly any chicken in it and and the egg was like a piece of paper . The fries were hard as rock and the hunter beef sandwich was like nehari in a bun. NEVER GOING AGAIN"}
{"text":"One friend of mine told me about this place, she was overly excited so I went with my family, tried the burger with fries, Paratha roll, stuffed puff pastry, chai , egg paratha. We were excited but after eating  it, we were not so happy because the freshness was missing.  The people at the front  were not very welcoming too."}
{"text":"I live downtown and often miss the ethnic food of the suburbs. So imagine my excitement when I went to see Bin Roye last year at AMC Courtney Park and saw this Snacks n Chai Cafe! I excitedly rushed over, for one more halal place in the GTA is something to celebrate, and a snacks and chai cafe is a truly novel idea. How wonderful, I thought! I can drive to Mississauga to watch a desi movie and then just walk over here for snacks and chai, and just let loose my inner fob! Alas, the cafe was not open then as it was still under construction.   But it opened this year in March, and I did have the chance to visit shortly thereafter in April. My best friend and I made a point of checking out Snacks n Chai for a makeshift Pakistani brunch one day. We had the bun kebabs (hers with egg, I believe) and two puff pastries (with chicken). I had the masala chai, and she had the kashmiri chai. My chai was very tasty. She said her Kashmiri chai was great as well. The bun kebab was decent. The price was right.   The restaurant itself is spacious and comfortable. One criticism I have is that the food was served to us in styrofoam boxes and paper plates and cups. It would taste much better in real dinnerware, I'm sure, and it would be more environmentally conscious.   I do anticipate next time there is a hotly anticipated new Bollywood or Pakistani film playing, I will make the trek to AMC Courtney Park and go get snacks n chai afterwards! I'm looking forward to trying the other things on the menu! Maybe the paratha rolls?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Pretty empty, but then again it was around 1pm. Had the club sandwich, beef patty, kashmiri chai and sweet lassi (shared among two of us).  All in all, it's not the most amazing place i've ever been to but not the worst. It was decent. You can't go wrong with snack food. I'd go again to try to falooda and other things on the menu:)"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and it's been alright. I had the karak chai and it was kind of bland, as other reviewers have mentioned. It's a strong tea, though. The next time I came here I had the iced chai and it's pretty good, albeit on the sweeter side. It kind of tastes like Hong Kong style milk tea - it's a strong brewed sweetened black tea with milk. Prices are decent. Ambience is not really a thing here, but it's a good local joint overall and they have a nice patio!"}
{"text":"Masala Chai was bad and so was the crispy chicken burger. Samosas were too tiny. All and all overpriced and not good."}
{"text":"Very nice snack place a sort of electic style decor. Good for casual hangouts with friends Their club sandwiches are very awesome. Also tried fried chicken burger which was yummy and very spicy. Chicken samosa was just ok. Puffs were good tasting and fresh. Chai was very refreshing. We went in the middle of driving from Niagra to whitby, and the chai took the tiredness away. Perfect authentic desi chai."}
{"text":"What a pleasant menu selection , giving you the back home desi experience  But what a disappointment. The ambience was nice. The service was prompt. The pricing was good too. But the food wasn't good at all. My wife and I both feel sick.  Chicken sandwich- too much mayo and black pepper. The sandwich was made quite a while ago. The bread was so not fresh.  Club sandwich- just blehhh. Have had many better ones.  Paratha roll - couldn't figure out where the chicken was in it. Couldn't tell what I was eating. Only thing good about it was its size.  Samosa chat- lacked yogurt and sweet chilly. Had to ask for some yogurt for it for an extra $1.00  As much as the place attracts desis; I wouldn't suggest it at all."}
