{"text":"It was my second time. I remember I really liked it the first time. I had a Greek salad and kebab. This time I decided to try something different so I ordered chicken wings. It was good but I had better before. I think they didn't put enough sauce so it was very bland. Service was very slow too..
I would go again and try something else..its a cute liitle place..."}
{"text":"It's actually now called Mother's Kitchen.  Found out about this place in the Snap'd newspaper.  Went one afternoon because I was craving liver.  I know...lol.  Server was friendly & food was served fast & hot.  Large serving size which most will like.  I love the Mom & Pop shops for home cooked meals.  The liver was great, cooked perfectly & served with onions & bacon.  The mashed potatoes were the bomb.  Really good.  The only reason why I'm not giving this review 4 stars is because of one issue.  Apparently the waitress was finished her shift during our meal.  She wanted us to cash out in the middle of our dinner.  This is a no no.  I don't know if this is a trust issue she has with the restaurant or what, but I can't even remember the last time I've been asked to do that, if ever."}
{"text":"I have to say the food was decent however upon paying we had 40 in gc as a gift from Xmas (received 100 from a fellow business owner already used some up with no problems) anyways we left the gc and the rest cash to make up the bill,the waitress  followed us out and told us they no longer honor gc because of new owners they don't accept them anymore.. So we went in to talk to the manager and he wasn't there so we spoke to the cook very rude cook and basically told us that we could have made them off the computer ourselves .so needless to say we were offended. He also said that because it's new owners they will not accept them so we needed to pay the 40. No where did it say that it was new owners and in fact we were there 1 month ago and used the other gc with no issues. This is horrible business practice and I will not be back nor will I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for breakfast with a party of 14 with reservations. Arrived at 11am ordered.. Still waiting for the food now 1pm. Everyone else received food. Except our table. They don't seem to care about their guests, we made a complaint and spoke up however we were told half off the bill. Our food started to show up at our table at 1:50pm and I had to send my plate back because they didn't know how to cook crêpes and gave me pancakes instead. On top of that they actually had the gull to charge me $9 + (half off) for pancakes that I never ate because they were crap and I ordered crêpes. I asked everyone else at my table how they found the food. Nobody enjoyed their meal, they screwed up 95% of our orders, poached eggs, Sunnyside up, over medium, they just made scrambled eggs. This place actually charges $8 to $15 for breakfast meals that is crap. Not only is the food crap but for the money you pay, the food portions are very small. So thankfully the food is crap because there is less of it to eat. I don't usually say this as this is the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, i felt sorry for the lady running this place. She honestly did not know how to run a restaurant, I will never go back to this place nor would I ever recommend anyone going to this restaurant. Your better off just cooking at home its way faster. We got out of this place at 2:30pm. 11am to 2:30pm it took about 3 hours to get our food. Its almost like they don't provide same day service. Anyway I had to go to McDonalds immediately afterwards to get breakfast however the breakfast menu was over so I grabbed a 1/4 pound meal with large fries & drink for $8.00 that resolved my hunger. I sincerely hope this place closes asap as it should not be in business."}
{"text":"I come here with a girlfriend of mine because it's close to her house and she likes the place. Had it not been for her, I would likely not even know about this restaurant.

Mother's Kitchen is your typical greasy spoon with typical greasy spoon fare. We came for lunch a few weeks ago and I opted for the BLT with fries. Absolutely no issues with the service, the food was spot on and of course the company was fantastic.

There's not really much to say about the place... the couple of times I've been here with her, it's never been overly busy and service has been quick and friendly. Nothing really to complain about.

Although it's not a place I would seek out to eat at, I will most likely be back here again with my friend and I have no issues with that!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new business that my husband and I recently discovered. We were first there for breakfast and really enjoyed the food and the bright sunny feel inside. The only downfall is its very hollow and a tad echo ridden but if you dont have a kids birthday beside you, its fine. Nice and clean, staff super nice, and the owner seems to really be trying to have good old fashioned food on the menu (I finally found a good chicken salad sandwich and didnt have to have a wrap!). The breakfast was great and we really liked the home fries, not soggy like other places and not crowded with all sorts of other stuff and spices. The plates for breakfast lunch and dinner are all really well priced and there are also daily specials. I had the soup of the day and it was a fabulous chicken rice with great seasoning and fillings, very well home made!
We are looking forward to this now becoming our favorite \"go to spot\" when you just want something good to eat without the fuss and flare and prices that go along with it!
We are hoping Daddy's Little Grill sticks around for a long time! Good work guys.
The bathrooms were spotless ladies."}
{"text":"Friend who lives in the area took us to this spot. And I had to thank her afterwards for showing us such a great place with such a good price. The food is not just all day breakfast but pretty much all the main items you can think of from burgers to chicken souvlaki to pasta. All of which were amazing. 

The place itself is large but does not well utilize the space so sometime there is a bit of a wait. But as I said, it is very worth it. On top of that the waitress was very friendly and helpful. 

Overall, a great place to have a meal in the area."}
