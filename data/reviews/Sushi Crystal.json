{"text":"The best all-you-can-eat sushi place in the city. Lots of options, speedy/friendly service, tablets with pictures to make ordering quick and easy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"In Montreal sushi buffet give 4 stars. But lower than toronto average taste. Want a full belly eat,not for people who want really taste of Japanese style."}
{"text":"Good food, super easy menu and fast service, the only thing that wasn't good was that my ipad had a delay to make my orders and some of the rolls that I ordered came with to much cucumber."}
{"text":"We came as a group of 6 people. Very good experience. I like the beef salad and sweet shrimp here. The waiter is very nice :D"}
{"text":"J'avais vraiment le goût de sushi!  Mais malheureusement l'hôtesse ne comprenait rien de ce que je lui disais, parce que je m'exprimais en français.  Je lui ai demandé. Mais elle ne pouvait pas avoir l'aide de collègues pour me pointer vers une table dans ma langue. Triste car ça me semblait bien comme place.  Difficile de comprendre qu'en 2015 une hôtesse d'un restaurant, qui semble bien (je parle ici du restaurant), ne puisse servir un client en français, ou ne puisse se faire aider d'un collègue comprenant la langue de Molière ou celle de Tremblay."}
{"text":"food was cold. Service was long. Made 3 orders, didn't received every item. I had to ask the waiter for my food. Ice cream was good tho. I paid like 67$ for 2 people, I think next time I'll just go to a real sushi restaurant, it's better than getting cold ass sushis."}
{"text":"This was a really fantastic AYCE sushi restaurant and I sincerely wish they had a location in Ottawa as it would quickly become my new favourite spot. I've been hesitant to try a new sushi place in Montreal as my previous experience with a different AYCE sushi restaurant had been quite poor. But I am definitely glad that I stumbled upon this little gem.   The interior is decorated beautifully with a giant crystal ceiling that changes colours. They had giant round tables and comfortable leather circular booths which were spacious and impressive. Service was excellent - our servers were attentive, they brought out our food promptly and made sure that we weren't missing any items. I never had to flag a server down to have my water replenished as someone was always around to do so.   They have a vast selection of food that includes sushi and a variety of kitchen items. Everything that we tasted was delicious and beautifully presented. I was not disappointed with any of the items we ate. The iPad menu is extremely useful and makes the ordering process painless and simple.   REALLY impressed. Will absolutely be back for sure the next time that I visit the city."}
{"text":"Delicious sushis, nice decor, ipad made it convenient & informative to order. Downside is waiting line at least 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience,quality food, fast service! My friend and I have been frequently having lunch at this place for the past 2 months now. Grilled salmon belly, mango salad, rice bowls are a must try!!worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I have been there couple times. Good quality and variety  of sushi with very poor costumer service. We happened to miss couple of orders many times. Once we were 7 ppl and stand in line up for more than an hour on Saturday( which was crowded), which was unacceptable. When we ask to match two tables to fits us, they refrain to do so and tend to get two smaller group which were just arrived. Simply, worst management and costumer service i have ever seen in montreal."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, bad service and food is disgusting. Chicken tasted undercook and sushi is not authentic."}
{"text":"I went there 3 times so far and I've never been disappointed! The food is fresh, I have never been sick (which happened in to me in other AYCE sushi places) and it's relatively cheap for lunch. The sushi is very good, obviously it's not the best in town but this is an all you can eat so you get what you pay for, and I'm looking forward to going back! Service could be better, but the food is what you go there for. They also have a nice decor."}
{"text":"Nice new chain all u can eat sushi place of sushi Tokyo,service are fast and friendly,food are almost fresh and tasty,especially the raw shrimp sashimi which was sweet and yummy!One downside is the mussel dishes we had last night were not so fresh. The decoration there is cool, I like the fancy chandelier ,maybe that's the reason it's a little pricey for a AYCE sushi place. One more thing,do avoid general Tao kinda of dish ,that was just ridiculous"}
{"text":"Best Buffet sushi experience in Montreal so far.  I went with a few friends.  Surprised by the iPad touch screen order system.  Lots of options of sushi, dishes, appetizers, etc.  When the order is made, it sends it immediately to the waiter. They bring us a print version to keep track of orders. Amazing. Minimum things most buffet sushi can't do. My favourite dish was the teriyaki salmon. It's just too good for the price you pay ;'( Tartare beef salad was amazing.  The quality of the food compare to the average sushi buffet is great.  Ambiance really relaxed. Good place to bring someone on a date.  They also have \"Moon\" chair for couples at the front. Good experience. Food quality is great. Environment is great. Good customer service.  No complain. Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Most amazing sushi I've ever had!!! Amazing drinks that pair well with the food. Was very excited about using tablets as menus."}
{"text":"The place looks phenomenal (luster and waterfall) and with the modern feeling with the tablet its just a dream come true for sushi lovers.Althought we didn't get good seats ,the staff are nice and friendly we laughed over the waiter calling us by the shirt we wore and made jokes about it.the meals were amazing specially the steak and general tao."}
{"text":"A few friends and i tried the new all you can eat sushi bar that is currently replacing the famous kaizen sushi restaurant.  I personally found this all you can eat sushi bar better than most all you can eat with a few down points. The waiters were horrible.  I understand that the restaurant is new ,  however the coordination of the staff was terrible,  i   had to   ask him when he brings us the sushis to tell us which one were which . He did  not know the prices of his  bottles are the amount and when finally i  ordered a  bottle...they did not have any more of the  one i wanted!  Fish and vegetables seem fresh ,  way better product that   i have seen compared to sushi crescent or kanda sushi HOWEVER they drown all there tartar and sushi in mayo which is very disappointing.   I believe the restaurant is still adjusting but  overall it is an  ok   restaurant. ...!"}
{"text":"Tasty food but they messed up my order and brought my food cold. (Bento box, so the rice tempura and the beef was cold  )  Beef was too thick and very little of it  I am used to miso soup coming with the bento box too...  Also, sat at the front of the restaurant ( view of the road ) and service was very bad"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my office so I will often pop in for lunch. When they first opened I thought that the place was pretty good for an all you can eat concept. Fresh ingredients, good service and a nice concept.   However, of late I've noticed that the quality of the food has been on the decline. Items such as the salt and pepper squid which was previously lightly battered and very tender have been replaced with much lower quality food. The squid dish, as an example, is now of the heavily breaded, tough and chewy variety.   Clearly they have started cutting corners to save costs.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Agghhhh! It's so frustrating when one person ruins an entire experience but here goes:  I've been to Sushi Crystal 3 times now and had I written my review the first two times, I would have rated it 5 stars. However, after my last visit, I've had to knock down several stars. Here's the story:  First visit: Early November. Excellent service and amazing food. Zero complaints  Second Visit: Early December. Same as before. Decided that this would be my new go-to AYCE sushi place  Third visit: This past weekend. I went with 4 other people and we placed our order shortly after being seated. It was a Saturday night and the service was very slow despite the restaurant not being at capacity. We realized after the first hour that they did not bring out all our food but had come out to ask us if we were ready to leave. At this point, we mentioned the missing items, and our unhappy server said that he would look into it. No food came.   So, we did what any normal person would do and placed a second order. Our server reacted to this with a pretty bad attitude and was shaking his head. We couldn't figure out the problem but assumed that he thought we were ordering too much food (our first order was barely anything past normal size-wise). From here on onwards the service to our table in particular slowed down immensely. Our server also asked us at least once more if we were ready to pay and was displeased when we said no.   Also, after placing this order, the server didn't reset our tablets (you order your food off a tablet btw! Super cool) so we could place another order which confirmed our suspicions that he didn't want to bring out any more food. We had to ask different servers and even the manager to unlock the tablet so that we could place orders for ice cream twice.  All in all, despite the food being amazing, we were not able to enjoy our time at Sushi Crystal due to the bad attitude of our server. I'm really not 100% sure what the problem was till now because if I think back, we truly didn't order that much...  Anyhow, with all this being said, I don't want to say that I won't be back because the food is very good. I'd like to think of this as an isolated incident and will try to return once more hoping for the excellent service I had twice before. But for now, 3 stars Sushi Crystal! :("}
{"text":"We live in Saint-Henri but when we want some all-you-can-eat sushi this is where we go! We don't mind climbing the hill to go to Sushi Crystal. Moreover with the tablet-based ordering system it feels great to actually see what you're gonna have. Usually we start with a green tea, miso soup and a salad. Then we take sushi. My favorites are the spicy salmon ones as well as what they called pink salmon with some mayo on top (nothing traditionally Japanese here), they're so good! We usually then take a sushi pizza some teriyaki beef that melts in your mouth and my girlfriend ends her meal with some tempura vegetables. To top it all you got some candies at the end when you pay, what better way to end a meal?"}
{"text":"This is honestly the best sushi in Montreal in my opinion, granted I have been to around 70% of the major sushi spots here. The service is outstanding, our waiter was so patient and funny. Their plating is fancy, and the taste is just wonderful. My personal favorite was the salmon pizza, I could eat those for days lol! The decor makes you feel like Tokyo, and it wasn't too crowded on a weekend."}
{"text":"Food were nice but way too expensive. We waited too long between orders (waiters said too many orders and they all messed up). The waiter set us in an awful spot (in a grim corner). Last order around 9:30 PM or earlier, be prepared for that."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi lunch for about $20. I had so much sushi. They have good sushis, one of my favourite AYCE sushi bars in Montréal. They have a wide range of sushi choices. They restaurant is spacious and looks very elegant. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the restaurant looks. I will definitively come here again."}
{"text":"I'm a newcomer to this AYCE (all you can eat - I am new to this lingo lol) sushi spot. Back in the day it was Kanda. I came here with a few of my Yelper friends for a girls night, we had a reservation for 6:30 pm. The place wasn't too crowded - I loved the donut booths that we got- comfy and private.   The service was great - team checked up on us regularly - and you order sushi from a tablet (no wow factor for me- I've seen this in Toronto). Each item had a picture -many types of sashimi, nigiri, and sides like several kinds of Sushi pizza!(Not a fan). My highlights : BBQ eel, dragon eye, salmon tartar on a pringle was interesting! But the quality of sushi here was average compared to the other places I've been. However we had a decent amount of fresh fish that easily made it worthwhile for the price. I didn't like that if you ordered too many pieces at once - the tablet stalls! Also there is no way of keeping track what dishes were delivered. I prefer the pencil and paper method - but kudos for going green. We split a white wine amongst  four of us for 8$ for 2 glasses each around. Decent wine selection. Cost : 33$ including tax with no drink - around 48$ with the wine and 15% tip. Good proximity near metro Atwater."}
{"text":"For sushi all you can eat is the best one! Usually go there with family at least 1 or twice a month. It is a big place and a lot of thing on their menu. It's not only sushi but a lot more. Ambience is great, customer service sometimes they've good, sometimes they've bad depend of theirs moods :)"}
{"text":"The most DISGUSTING sushi you'll ever eat. YUCK.  I AM WRITING THIS on breaks between bathroom visits. Went to dinner in a party of 4. 3 of us had salmon and tuna fish. The tuna was off! I immediately spat it out. The salmon has a 'soapy' smell which meant I couldn't get past eating. This dish was appropriately named because the same 3 of us who partook in it came down with food poisoning the next morning. And no, we're not talking about some mild-stomach-cramping-and squirts here. We're talking about curled-up-in-a-fetal-position-on-the-bathroom-floor-crying, hands-and-feet-going-numb.  And WORST MOST RUDE service EVER. When I think of that tuna smell I just feel sick. What a disgrace, they shouldn't have a license to serve fresh food never mind sushi."}
{"text":"First order(appetizers), got it all. Waiter was catastrophic, thankfully dealing with him was minimized, thanks to the tablets. Sent the second order. Waiting waiting, never got it. Waiter comes to tell us it's last call. We prepare a small third order for desert. He says it's too late, brings the bill. We argue about our second order, which we never got.  He threatens to call the police because we won't pay as we didn't get our order. Waiting for police. Police comes an hour later Conclusion, you should pay for what you order. They reduced the tab and let us leave after another hour and endless negotiations. Wouldn't recommend the experience, good luck if you do go."}
{"text":"I'm a well traveled person and I ate sushi in both Vancouver and Japan. So I'll try to give the most neutral opinion on this place.   For a Montreal sushi place, it's ok. We came here for lunch, so not that expensive, but we couldn't get every item that would be on the night menu. I.e: no sashimi or tuna for example.   The staff was nice and friendly. We ordered on an iPad which is fun. Everything came to our table very quickly.   Food wise, it's average. The fish had no aftertaste, which is a plus. The tempura was crispy. Dumplings weren't that great, hard dough and not a lot of stuffing. Very small rolls and fish pieces (so lots of rice).   So overall,for all you can eat in Montreal, it's a safe bet. Place looks clean too. Probably wouldn't pay full price for it though."}
{"text":"Recommended to a friend and we had her birthday dinner there, and everybody loved it:) it was very nice that they offered a separate menu for a friend needed gluten free food. Also they are the all you can eat sushi place that offered the most variety of options I have seen so far and I loved that they have grilled saury fish :D"}
{"text":"The Asian waiter with glasses is a bitch. He is a little bit fat. I don't understand why this place has this kind of waiter. Sushi Crystal was my favorite sushi buffet before, but their waiters and waitresses are kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"Nice decor and comfy seating.   Service is very fast and accurate.   I will say the fact that we have to order on an ipad made us order a bit too much. You can't clearly see everything you order because it adds it to your cart instead of seeing it all laid out.  Price on a Tuesday was 25$ for dinner and although that's a bit more than I would pay, it's not too bad.   This is a solid AYCE sushi place! I would go back."}
{"text":"Legit the best sushi place in Montreal. Not even a joke, it's amazing. The selection of salads and the array of different rolls while at the same time maintaining a 5 star quality of service had me in awe. The mango salmon roll was by far my favourite, and the crab tartar, yum!   For a drink I seriously recommend the lychee blueberry sangria. The waitress was so lovely in asking us for our taste and what we normally enjoy and suggested that drink, so impressed. So sweet and no taste of alcohol. It was divine.  Favourite place for sure :)"}
{"text":"I think this is the best AYCE sushi restaurant we have in Montreal at the moment. In terms of service, selection, taste and price it all pretty much stacks up to the others and beats them. I had noticed this restaurant in the past, but it's exterior is misleading...it's much larger inside! I came with a group of friends and we got one of the circular booths, which was pretty comfortable. I was tasked with ordering the first round, which totaled to 88 pieces for 4 of us. When the food started to arrive I was worried that would wouldn't be able to finish it, but we were able to get a second round in (although I was stuffed to the brim). We tried appetizers, sashimi, nigiri sushi, sushi rolls, tempura, udon, and some other items...I didn't get photos of all of them but you can have a look at some of the selection. Everything tasted fresh and was satisfying....not one complaint from any of us! There is the stunning crystal chandelier which gives the atmosphere a more upscale vibe. There was a couple of slow service moments, and the bathroom was a bit messy (but not dirty)....so that's why it's not rated a perfect 5."}
{"text":"Not happy. Didn't order from buffet, waiting 1 hour for service!!! They are watching me, so I won't eat!!! And michael (the manager) saw I had garnish in my plate and asked me what is that!!! Omg. Awful addition to westmount!Worse place ever!!!!! Do not go! and The manager michael the manager tells Me he is confused. Not happy. Do not go. Go to park restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Nice place,good service...the food is good for all you can eat sushi...but for waiting the food...it's a little bite slow....for the price...it's expensive than the other all you can eat sushi..."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi are wayyyy better than Tokyo Sushi in downtown. The tempura shrimp is so well fried. Everything taste super fresh.   Ordering with the ipad is a plus, you can see what u ordered so that you wont over order.  The plating is realy nice too, especially for the beef salad.  One con is that some orders did not arrive at all. Since we were able to track our orders, its easy to see what did not come.   Definitely the best place to go for all you can eat sushi!"}
{"text":"Nice sushi buffet. The ordering system is well set up to allow you to order on tablets. Fair warning though, you can only order again once your first wave of orders is completed."}
{"text":"I passed this cool-looking restaurant many times during my many visits to Montreal and, for years, I thought this corner building with the round, shell-like exterior with the windows facing the street was the neatest building EVER. Recently, though, I decided to finally go in. (It now is a sushi place).  I decided to take out a platter of sushi for my dinner. Looking through the menu, I was blown away by all the choices. It's a HUGE menu: soups, salad, apps, teriyaki, rice and noodle dishs, bento box meals, \"traditional\" Chinese dishes (eg, General Tao chicken, orange beef, etc.), tons of sushi and sashimi rolls, platters (great catering idea!), tempura.... I could  go on and on. I've rarely seen such a vast menu. They also have all you can eat (wow, my kids and husband would think they died and went to heaven!). And not only can you dine in or take out, but I saw on their menu that they also deliver. Neat!  This place is affiliated with four other sushi restaurants in Montreal (another one on St. Catherine St.W., one on Crescent St., one on Rue St. Denis, and one on St. Jean Blvd in Pointe Claire).   I ordered the \"T2\" platter, and waited about 10 minutes for them to prepare it. Watching the sushi chefs make my meal in the back (open prep space behind the rear counter), I could see that the food was fresh and the cooks maintained a clean work space). I checked the restaurant interior; it was contemporary, with cool lighting colors, cascading water sculptures, and the curvilinear window wall facing the street. I'd have loved to have dined inside, if I had had the time.   The ladies who helped me order and who rang me up were super nice. I had asked if I could get the kamikaze sushi without the spicy sauce on top and they were happy to oblige. My platter was ready soon enough, and when I had it for dinner later that night (and for lunch the next day, too), it was delicious! Great place. I plan on going again next summer when I next visit!"}
{"text":"Ok so I've been back to this AYCE sushi location in Westmount a couple of times and here's what stood out as bad:  -the \"garlic beef\" was essentially small meat scraps that were inedible - unlike the ginger beef saute, which is delicious and has large pieces of appealing meat. -the enoki mushroom beef roll was a joke, they were literally miniature and nothing like the picture! -the corn on the cob was essentially 1/6 of a normal corn on the cob. It tasted ok but the size was hilarious. -the sweet potato tempura was massive!! way too big and tasted more like pumpkin. -the shrimp tempura roll was sooo dry and not very tasty at all. -our iPad kept glitching. -also, the service was inconsistent.  What I like about sushi crystal is the comfortable seating, the decor, the (overall) efficient service, the cool factor of ordering on an iPad (when it works), as it provides pictures and descriptions of all of the potential food options you can order.   The sushis in general are ok but it was the available asian food we really liked i.e., teriyaki beef, ginger beef, deep fried veg dumplings, udon noodles stir fry, tempura shrimp, edamame, sushi pizzas, etc. I also like the fact that we can more easily find street parking near this location."}
{"text":"Gross. Takes forever to get your order.  Bathrooms are disgusting.  Line out the door, we waited over an hour and they forgot to call our reservation, then were indignant when we said something. They completely forgot our sake and then they brougt our food out with glass in it. Oh, and they charged us for it. Overall a terrible experience."}
{"text":"My rating is based on takeout orders.  After reading many reviews, I wasn't expecting much.   My boyfriend and I ordered for takeout and were amazed at the prices vs quantity&quality. Each piece came out to under 1$. No where will you find this (ranging prices are between 1.50-2$ per piece)  Food : the sushi was good. I liked everything on the platter and there wasn't too much rice. The salmon sashimi was cut a little thick, but still good.  Service : the restaurant was not busy when we went but it was very fast service. We ordered 47 pieces and it was ready in under 15min. Nothing was premade (we had nothing to do but sit and watch, so we truly saw every piece being made in front of us).  Decor : again, we only sat in for a little while, but it seemed very nice and clean.  We will try a dine-in shortly."}
{"text":"We called on a Thursday and asked if we could make a reservation for two on Saturday, unfortunately they couldn't but reassured us that we'd be welcomed in a timely manner. They kept their word, every seat in this restaurant is good and we didn't have to wait even though it was packed. The menu is actually on a tablet for each table, so you send your order directly to the kitchen! The wait time for food is so fast but the sushi is perfected every time! One of the best places in Montreal! The presentation is beautiful and makes you feel special. The ingredients are extremely fresh and the maki rolls are bursting with intricate and  amazing combinations of flavors. The salmon sashimi melts in your mouth. Also, try the sushi pizza. I love sushi pizza and theirs is the best I've ever had! The servers are friendly, fast, and eager to help explain the tablet system. I would add some negative feedback but I honestly can't think of anything, big or small. You will not be disappointed with this all-you-can-eat sushi Haven!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Montreal, this is my favorite place for good sushi! The food is great and it's all you can eat!"}
{"text":"Like this sushi buffet...   The food is good, place is clean and pleasant, and staff is friendly however I need to mention they did not bring us the full order while we went for all you can eat for lunch in different times! We had to ask servers multiple times to check with kitchen and bring us the rest of our order. Last time we were a group of 8 and lots of sushis were ordered, not all of them were brought to out table though! We didnt notice until we finished! They need to pay more attention to the quality of service they provide for buffet.   Love their Salmon Roses!   I recommend this place. You can get good sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"We came as a small group of ladies looking to stuff our faces. There was nearly always a service staff available and they made themselves appear often to check on us. The location itself it visually pleasing and cleanliness is not to be questioned from what I saw, which is important when doing AYCE.  As someone who doesn't know much about sushi I love their self-ordering tablet system. Gives you a visual, a list of ingredients, and you're not stuck trying to point or butcher pronunciations when placing an order with a staff member like most AYCEs. We tried pretty much some of everything and nearly all of it was quite tasty. I wasn't a fan of their \"torced\" fish dishes but their tempura was perfect. The sushi itself wasn't over stuffed with rice, which I would expect as their at the higher end of the price point for AYCE on off-nights ($26 +tax/tip so about $33 before drinks). Their service was staggered as you would expect, but they didn't stretch it out which was nice. While most of their flavors were good, I was particularly impressed with their fish, when ordering a single piece of salmon or tuna the quality was apparent. I loved that they had pricing specifically for kids, toddlers & seniors."}
{"text":"I read some reviews and went there a bit nervous, but Ive been 3-4 times already and have never been disappointed. For an All You Can Eat sushi spot, it's beautiful and awesome! I love using the tablets to order, and there are so many options beyond sushi for those who aren't fish enthusiasts. The service has always been super friendly to us, so I'm pleased and hoping it'll stay this way"}
{"text":"Food was fine but service could have been better.  The manager (her name is Samantha) came to our table to complain about the tips (we gave between 10 and 13% each, instead of \"minimum\" 15%). She wanted to have our opinion on servers we had and they were great. So we told her, she actually was the problem when she served us, she was rude and not polite, no \"please\" or \"thank you\" when we helped her to clear the table and so on... It was a farewell party and she kinda ruined it at the end with her complains."}
{"text":"Ma branche préférée de toutes les succursales de Sushi Montréal, je les ai toutes essayées (st-denis, st-cath, crescent, et  crystal).  Sushi Crystal est ma préférée car le service est plus efficace selon moi, j'aime beaucoup l'utilisation des tablettes pour commander ce qui rend les commandes de groupe plus facile comparé au petit papier des autres branches. Il y a plus de serveuses/serveurs, donc même quand il y a beaucoup de monde tu ne ressens pas le rush.  La qualité du sushi est vraiment bonne, je trouve que les entrées sont froides mais jamais congelé et la soupe miso n'est pas trop réduite au point d'être trop salé. Le riz est toujours à bonne température, ni trop chaud ni trop froid. Et j'ai beaucoup essayé les extra plats chaud qui sont sur leur menu.   La décoration est également extra, chandelier en faux crystal qui pend du plafond, un petit bassin à l'entrée avec des poisson koï. Les banquettes sont en très bon état, sans trous et pas collantes.  Alors pourquoi quatre étoiles me diriez vous, parce que des fois les serveurs sont un peu lents et oublient de t'apporter de l'eau ou ton thé vert, et il y a toujours moyen de s'améliorer."}
{"text":"It's nice. Order with a tablet. Foods are good but not for that price. It's a bit over price for all you can eat sushi. And I went on a weekday as well. It's more expansive than other sushi place in downtown on weekend. The service is good overall. Or maybe there is not much people. But some of our order is missing and they threw away the printed order list before everything come. then we never get our mussels.   They uses new concept of ordering using tablet. Maybe it's still in beta? There seem to be issue with each order. Kinda annoying.  Overall good. Recommend. But will not return ."}
{"text":"I think this might be the best sushi place I have ever been to in Montreal. The food comes in fast and you order it with tablets! What kind of annoyed me was that they only played Ariana Grande songs..."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was very fast. We went during lunch in the middle of the week. There was a huge table beside us (probably an office outting) and the waiters were still very quick with our orders. Friendly staff. Great ambiance & decor. I would definatetly return."}
{"text":"Quality and quantity of the food is really good. Most of the sushi bars in downtown do not serve sashimi for lunch ( except Kanda) Taking order using tablet was so good, 'cause I knew exactly what I would eat. The stuffs and manager were so polite and friendly. I like the decoration. Despite of all the sushi bars, it didn't smell bad.  The price is a little higher than other places ( 1 or 2$) while the quality is extremely better."}
{"text":"I think the people raring this place low, are Westmount workers / residents  And perhaps former clients of Kaizen who are unfamiliar with this type of sushi restaurant.   The location is what use to be one of MTL's most popular and higher end Japanese restaurants : Kaizen Sushi House . Kaizen was one of our favorite restaurants when I was growing up so I understand the disappointment one might feel if they walk into the same space and expect something more traditional or upscale.   Unfortunately if you know anything about the food industry, you know it's impossible to do what Kaizen did at the price / value of Crystal Sushi. So for this reason I think the reviews are unfair.   I've been to most all you can eat Sushi places in MTL, and this is one of my top 2. Its definitely fresh, the service was friendly and efficient, the lunch price is awesome and the location is accessible, clean casual, and fun to be in.   If I were to say one thing to be improved on , it would be a wider variety of sauces and or \"flavors\" BUT this is how they keep the prices so low and can offer such fresh produce I guess so...once again it's definitly at the top of it's game for it's kind."}
{"text":"I just ordered here from just eat for the second time. The first order of salmon teriyaki and salmon was delicious and satisfying. This time I ordered the chicken teriyaki and beef ribs. What I got was a cold soup with hard rice and 4 minuscule pieces of beef which were on top of it, at least half fat and cost 6$. The chicken barely had any flavour and the vegetables either. I'm really disappointed I wish I could get my money back but I will not be re-ordering.  Maybe it's because it's a Friday night? The quality has declined drastically!"}
{"text":"Fun all you can eat sushi place right next to atwater metro. Fish was fresh and service was very fast."}
{"text":"I went there twice and both the times I loved it :) :)! the service was good too :) Wish they had some mango vegetarian sushi."}
{"text":"Menu order via a tablet makes things easy (pictures and text explanation). Extremely fast service. Good tasting food. Average pricing."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Sushi Crystal so decided to give it a try. We waited ten minutes to be seated. My date and I were given tablets to order our sushi which we thought was neat. About thirty minutes after our sushi arrived slowly. It took us two hours between the time we sat down to the time we left as the kitchen was understaffed. The sushi was delicious and everything was very fresh. I would like to give this place another try in the near future. Good prices, ambiance and music."}

{"text":"A delicious all you can eat sushi restaurant, what more can you ask for? I literally love this place and it's the best all you can eat sushi spot in Montreal that I've been to (and I've been to A LOT). The food comes out very quickly and the fish tastes fresh (unlike a lot of establishments). Also, you order on a tablet which makes everything so much easier. The photos of the food on the tablet look very unappetizing, but trust that the actual food they'll bring out will be more visually appealing. The lunch special is from 11:30-3 and what I love about this place is that if you're seated at 2:58 they'll still let you pay the lunch special price! The special is priced at $17.99, which I KNOW is a lot of money for all you can eat sushi but unfortunately that's pretty standard pricing for Montreal."}
