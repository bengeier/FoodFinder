{"text":"This is a very interesting restaurant, it only have 4-5 table, it is located in Brossard, owned by a Hong Konger. From the outside it look like a very down to earth family restaurant, but they would take special request and make foie gras and lobster for you. It is call Mrs Amigo, a hidden gem."}
{"text":"At first i wasn't sure about this restaurant because i found it a bit skeptical...Chinese people cooking western food but it turned out so great! The food is excellent! The price is super affordable and if you want something special...u can always ask them and they will make it.   Their cheesecake is to die for...every dish is made with such care.   They also offer morning breakfast and Chinese food for lunch. At night they have western food. The place is quite small and the decoration of the place is ok...but food is awesome there. On top of that...it's bring your own wine too =)"}
{"text":"Mrs. Amigos is an unpretentious eatery that offers cafe fare, brunch, and French dining options.  The atmosphere presents a family-friendly room and the clientele (at least when I went in) consisted of retirees and families of East Asian origin.  The decor seems to reflect the clientele well (or perhaps it's the clientele that reflects the decor?); it's a unique combination of French bistro with children's drawings adorning the glass window and there are even a few Asian touches.   My partner and I tried the brunch items, which tasted exactly like my mom's!  The presentation was good, however, some of the items were... slightly scorched.  They weren't so burnt that I couldn't eat them, but it did look a little odd on my plate, and hey, I wouldn't dare criticize mom's food for fear of punishment!  And just like mom, the server (could it have been THE Mrs. Amigos?) had a slight tone of disapproval when we couldn't finish our plates.  I didn't really like having to feel guilty for leaving a small piece of food on my plate (almost reminded me of Spirite Lounge)... but whatever...  All in all, I wouldn't come back here for breakfast, but I might come back for lunch or supper since the plates looked quite good."}
{"text":"The three of us, my grandmother, mother and myself were looking for international cuisine, but we found so much more at Mrs. Amigos!!!! This is a small restaurant run by one woman, a kind-hearted lady who barely advertises, just trying to make ends meet. But there is more than what meets the eye, her professional, delicious gourmet French cuisine at a steal! Affordable, amazing and HIGHLY recommended. Patient service, even through a language barrier. The atmosphere is INCREDIBLY friendly. I have absolutely NOTHING even moderately bad to say about this low-key treasure of a diner."}
{"text":"After a very strenuous morning of paddling, my dragon boat team chose to have lunch at Mrs. Amigos. We made reservations but showed up early as a few members of our team had flights to catch. This was not a problem for the staff here.  We were all seated comfortably and were even served with some tasty spring rolls!  All of us were starving so I was a little worried on how quickly we would be served our food as this is a very small restaurant suited to serve about 20 people and we pretty much filled the capacity. To my surprise we were served in good time. The staff here is very efficient and so friendly. They made us all feel at home. You can tell that the chef in the kitchen takes pride in her cooking as it was cooked perfectly and the ingredients used are all fresh.  I have to say that if I lived in the south shore I would be a regular here. I can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Tacos, burritos, and quesadillas, those aren't the things that you're going to find at Mr Amigos. Wait what? Yup. This restaurant is run by Asians offering French food with a bit of their own touch. The food might not be the most authentic but their food will certainly bring you back.   Starting with the service, pretty standard except for one time where we were served by a little kid. He was trying to be too polite and things got quickly awkward in a certain way. Regardless of that, the food is carefully cooked. I was surprised at how tender most of the meats were. The cook certainly has talent and he isn't afraid to show it.   Mrs. Amigos has to be among the best restaurants in Brossard in my opinion. If you live nearby and haven't been there, do yourself a favor and treat yourself a meal at Mrs. Amigos."}
