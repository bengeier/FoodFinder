{"text":"Great chicken Caesar salad! It's not your typical Caesar where the sauce is heavy and Kraft-like. They somehow managed to keep the dressing light yet full of the Caesar-y goodness flavour. Pretty expensive though."}
{"text":"Cafe Green is a solid lunch spot serving a healthy selection of sandwiches and salads with a bit of a unique twist in that you can get a glass of wine with you lunch. All the salads and sandwiches that I have tried have been very good and the portions are generous. Additionally,  they have a great home made brownie.   Cafe Green provides a great offering in the grab a quick lunch category."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times I had enjoyed my lunch. For about 10$ you get a sandwich and a small side salad and you can upgrade to soup for an extra 2$. They have really nice selections of sandwichs (meat, fish, vegetarian and vegan) and nice selections of big portion salads (15$ with a side soup). The food feels fresh and healty and its a great place to come work, relax or have a business meeting."}
