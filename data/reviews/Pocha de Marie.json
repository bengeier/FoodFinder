{"text":"J'ai beaucoup aimé la place qui est calme et l'ambiance y est confortable! Les prix sont bien adéquat en fonction de la qualité de la nourriture (qui d'ailleurs est excellente!!!!!!). Je suis très satisfaite de cette expérience et je conseillerais cette place pour toutes personnes vivant ou étudiant dans les environs!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with great drinks!   Must haves... the Mandu Salad, Bulgogi Burger and Fried Chicken!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés à huit pour un dîner. Première visite et j'espère que ce ne sera pas la dernière. Les portions sont copieuses et très goûteuses. Les plats de Bibimbap ont été très appréciés. Mon fils a pris le plat de calmar et il a raffolé. Le décor est effectivement minimaliste mais c'est le genre du quartier et c'est parfait pour un repas décontracté."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de déception pour cet endroit!  La salle est froide et sans personnalité!  Il faut dire aussi que nous étions la seule table du restaurant en ce mercredi soir....mais c'est pas une raison! La carte est restreinte et ne fait clairement pas rêver....et l'accueil est plutôt glacial!  Les plats sont quasiment tous épicés...demandez bien conseil au serveur si vous ne voulez pas être surpris!"}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant through Yelp app. Found the menu very interesting and many good reviews! So it was a must try for me!  Disappointment.  Got my free kimchi for checking-in on Yelp app. It tasted a lot of the sesame oil that they put in it. At the bottom of the dish, we could actually see the oil floating... It was spicy enough to my liking though!  Tried the bibimbap, kimchi-bulgogi burger and tacos! The bibimbap was bad. It was tasteless. Had to add a lot of their spicy sauce in order to have some flavour. The vegetables that they put as toppings, some were extremely salty and some extremely sour...  The tacos. Tried the bulgogi and spicy pork. They were good, but could be better. I find that it was lacking the korean touch on it. For some reason, it tasted similar to tacos that I had at a Mexican restaurant. I think the marinade of the meat could be a bit more korean traditional. The burger was ok. Same as for the tacos, it tasted bland and lack some korean-ness.  The service was good! We were greeted rapidly. Food came relatively quick. We we're sharing food and they actually separated the burger for us! Thumbs up for that!  Overall, very cool concept of korean fusion! There could be improvements for the taste of the food (more korean seasonings/marinade)! Good service! But it will probably be my only visit there."}
{"text":"Bon... je vais être franche avec vous, j'ai été un peu déçue de mon expérience à Pocha de Marie. Après avoir lu de super commentaires de Yelpeurs et vu la note moyenne de 4,5 / 5 étoiles, je m'attendais à quelque chose de super.... ce qui ne fut pas le cas :( Déjà, le cadre n'est pas terrible, aucune déco, aucune ambiance, on se croirait presque dans une cantine. Ensuite, l'accueil du serveur (manager?) ne fut pas des plus agréables, plusieurs fois j'ai eu l'impression qu'on le 'gonflait' car nous étions la seule table de ce mercredi soir (désolés!!!) D'ailleurs, mon check in de Yelp n'a pas fonctionné, ce qui fait que ce même serveur ne voulait pas m'offrir l'entrée de kimchi comme c'était le cas pour mes amis.. j'ai trouvé ça un peu poche.. ce n'est pas de sa faute si l'appli ne marchait pas très bien, mais bon il voyait bien que j'essayais et que ça ne fonctionnait pas... On a finalement réussi à faire mon check in au bout d'un bon bout de temps, mais bon, il fallait être tenace et patient... Pour nous faire patienter, on nous a apporté des raviolis (1 chacun), offerts par la maison (nice!) Au niveau de la bouffe, il y avait casiment que des plats piquants, sans possibilités de diminuer le niveau de piquant... Alors les choix étaient quand meme assez restreints pour ceux qui n'aiment pas trop le piquant (dans d'autres coréens, il me semble que ya le choix?!) Bref, moi j'aime le piquant, ça ne m'a pas dérangé, et j'ai pris le burger, qui était très bon! Au niveau de la musique, c'était un peu bizarre aussi car il y avait un peu de tout, du latino, etc.. Mais bon, pourquoi pas.. A la fin, on ne se sent pas de rester, le cadre est froid et l'ambiance un peu morte.. Bref, ceci est mon expérience, j'ai hâte de lire les prochaines afin de pouvoir comparer.."}
{"text":"Great and only Korean restaurant in the upper cote des neiges area. They offer free tea which today was iced because it's starting to get warmmm outside.  They have a nice and sunny little terasse to enjoy.   This place opened in October 2016 and is continuously upgrading their menu (so it is very likely that the waiter will offer you meals that are not on the menu etc.)  The vegetarian  dolsot bibimbap is only 11$ and you can pick how you want your egg to he cooked. For only 2. 50$ extra you can choose to add meat or tofu and you can pick 3 veggies to put in your bibimbap (for free) see pictures formore details.  Their homemade sauce is offered on the side so you can pick your level of spiciness yourself   They take reservation, accept cash credit and debit and have delivery with Uber eats. Plus free WiFi password : kalbitaco74   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on (yet another) work lunch. We were all pleasantly surprised.  The staff is very friendly. The lunch menu is small, which to me is good for lunches as you don't want to waste to much time pondering what you might eat. There's a choice of bibimbap, ramyun and other korean food served a more occidental way. I had the bulgogi ramyun soup and it was quite good though it could have had more beef. Only down point is I didn't get why I received a bowl of rice even though I had noodles in my soup! It's quite affordable for lunch as well (9$ the ramyun soup), so all in all a nice lunch place if you ever fancy some korean food."}
{"text":"Great meal. We were a group of 4 and shared the Sam party (pork), korean bbq (beef), fried chicken and seafood jeon. Everything was delicious and the service was very friendly. In a fun neighborhood close to UdeM. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and super friendly service ! Catered to all dietary needs - vegetarian / vegan friendly and can even accommodate gluten free . The owners explained the menu and answered all questions with patience - very knowledgeable about dishes and proud of their little establishment . They call the cuisine \"modern Korean\"  but there was a little bit of everything on the menu from Asian style dishes to burgers and tacos, - hints of Mexican and barbecue in many dishes. The appetizers were very tasty- make sure to try the dumplings ! BIbimbaps entrées with choices of ingredients and options to make them vegan or vegetarian ... I have a newfound liking towards fiddleheads ! Range of sauces from mild to super spicy - everything was flavorful, including the red bean ice cream with sweet potato purée and rice cakes on top! I can't wait to  return - extremely reasonable prices were an added bonus ! This restaurant is a new hidden gem in the cote des neiges area !"}
{"text":"Cute little place.The food was delicious. I had the bibimpap and a side of cheese rice cakes. The chef is adorable. When we were all done eating, she came by to check if we enjoyed her food and she always had a big smile on her face. This place also offers ubereats:) lovely place, would recommand this place."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch.  Very sunny and clean place to enjoy lunch with friends. Food was amazing and price was super nice, sevice was very friendly. Definitely wanna go back for another dishes."}
{"text":"So one of my favourite Montreal date nights is to pick a place from my long To Try list up in the Cote-des-Neiges area and go for a food adventure and then a weird movie experience at the Star Cite cinema nearby (so weird. So great.) Last night I took my baby to Pocha de Marie and we had such a lovely meal and great chats with Steve, one of the owners, I can't wait to go back.   We shared a tofu kimchi jjigae and a daily special with 6 mushrooms and though both dishes were hefty and bountiful we couldn't stop eating and we polished it all off. The house hot sauce was awesome on everything, and the Beau's beer on tap was a bonus. They also had the Ippon beer by Jukebox on tap which I had never tried before but got to sample and it's so great and such an awesome choice to pair with these flavours.   We also rediscovered the toasted barley tea and were able to take home a big bag of tea bags, organic, for 3$, the perfect thing for winter.   This place is small and unassuming, decorated very simply if a little choatically but perfectly clean. I'd suggest removing any unhealthy looking plants, that always gives me bad vibes, and taking down any unnecessary decor, and really just keep focusing on doing the amazing job they are doing with thoughtful, clean, interesting food and drink.   The vegetarian options were super excellent and in general we just loved it."}
{"text":"bibimbap and donkatsu was delicious. haven't tried the fusion food but korean foods were excellent. and I'm korean!"}
{"text":"Happy 1 year anniversary to this restaurant!!  I didn't get the chance to eat there when yelp has an event. I miss out on some great food there! The menu has variety. I ordered the bimbibap with bulgogi and I had three different vegetables to choose from the set of 6. After 5 minutes, the food arrived. The bimbibap and the spicy sauce was separated. The server remembered i dont like spocy food and it was replaced by teriyaki sauce instead.    Overall, the place has a lot of potential to stay. The mixture of korean and quebecois style make this little place a special one. Keep the innovation coming and keep serving awesome tea! The service is excellent with a very knowledgeable owner!"}
{"text":"The staff is nice and the place can be pleasant when it's not busy, but there are better options in the area. I went there for lunch on a weekday and the place was about 80% full but the kitchen was already unable to cope. It took forever to get our food. It gets fairly noisy when it's busy, which doesn't make the waiting more pleasant. I had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) and was disappointed. It was dry and tasteless like this review. The marinated daikon that came with it was yummy though, but that's about the only thing that I really liked in this dish."}
{"text":"Delicious korean food. Would definitely recommend. Friendly staff and a good place to eat alone or with friends. Food is worth it's price. Unique burrito. First time tasting something like this."}
{"text":"I don't go to the Cote des Neiges neighbourhood too often so I am not very familiar with the dining options here.  That is why I jumped at the chance to attend a Yelper Adventure at Pocha de Marie, a newish restaurant in the area.  It's a very casual place serving up Korean food  with a little bit of Korean/Mexican fusion thrown in.  Like I said the menu is mostly Korean but there are a few Korean/Mexican fusion dishes thrown in there like kim chi burritos. I figured I would give the fusion a taste and ordered the tteokbokki au gratin.  This dish was tteokbokki, which contained fish and some kind of rice dumpling in tomato sauce, covered with cheese and thrown in the oven.  While it was on the heavy side it was delicious.  It was also a bit spicy which I liked.  The portion was huge and I actually wasn't able to finish it.  If you are in the mood for a cocktail then you should try their creation, the Kimchilada, which is a take on the michilada.  Instead of using lime they use kimchi juice and they line the rim of the glass with spicy seasoning instead of salt.  I really enjoyed the cocktail and I have to say that I'm glad that they used spicy seasoning instead of salt to line the glass because it added a little kick to the drink.    Prices were incredibly reasonable.  I only paid about $30 for my meal after tax and tip and given the quality and quantity of the food I felt that I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"Great place with great ambiance. Just next to University of Montreal.   I believe it's first korean restaurent near UdeM. They don't have many dishes, but they offer tasty dishes. Very good.  Also it's not expensive.  Edit : they should offer kimchi or kimchi radishes like other korean restaurents."}
{"text":"Une place ouverte depuis peu (moins de 3 semaines). On sent que la place est récente et a été rénovée avec les moyens du bord comme on peu le voir dans beaucoup de petits restaurants asiatiques ou autre = l'attention n'est pas vraiment portée sur les finitions.  Néanmoins l'espace est assez agréable et lumineux grâce à sa grande baie vitrée donant sur une rue très calme.  Commence juste à avoir ses premiers rush de clients.   Attention : le service est en train de s'adapter au changement et le temps d'attente pour se faire prendre en charge et servir est clairement LENT en ce moment durant les périodes de rush.  Les prix sont standard et la qualité correcte.  On peut espérer de grosses améliorations sur la prise en charge des nouveaux clients."}
{"text":"My friend and i discovered this place near UdeM on a thursday. We were hungry and we passed next to the restaurant and decided to give it a try. We were pleasantly surprised and we cannot wait to go back. Service was very good, the staff is nice and friendly. We both had the bibimbap and we loved it.   This restaurant is must!"}
{"text":"Fundamentally soild korean restaurant with a fun trendy twist, reasonably priced will definitely be back and tell my friends about it"}
{"text":"Decided to come here after finding out that my usual restaurant was closed today. I've heard great things about this place thanks to a few yelpers, so I thought it was a perfect opportunity to try it.   When I arrived with my friend, the restaurant was empty and we picked the table in front of the large window facing the street.   We were immediately served warm tea (perfect drinking temperature!) and given menus. We spent so much time choosing! We ended up ordering a taco party (non-traditional Korean) and a Korean BBQ (traditional).   While waiting, we got our free kimchi (yay yelp check ins!). We wanted to taste it first, then wait to eat it with our food. However, it was just too good! We could stop, even if we kept saying \"this is the last piece. Stopping now.\" We ended up finishing the entire thing... oops!   The taco was obviously a Korean-Mexican fusion dish. It actually tasted amazing! I don't know what they add to that guacamole, but it's delicious! This dish was somewhat oily though, so I had to go wash my hands afterwards :)   The Korean BBQ was also quite tasty. The flavours were nice. The broccoli in it was AMAZING! Sadly, there were only three pieces :( lots of other veggies though!   We then shared a dessert, 1 scoop of ginger ice cream and 1 scoop of red bean ice cream topped with pineapple coulis and 2 ginger cookies. It was so good!   We also drank A LOT of tea... way too much tea. I had at least 7 glasses. Probably more.   The price is also very reasonable. The entire meal cost us about 25$ each after tax/tip.   They run such an amazing restaurant. Definitely worth a visit!"}
