{"text":"Rien de spécial pour ce resto. Il y a de meilleurs restaurants rapide que ce Libanais."}
{"text":"If you want slightly above average lebanese, this is the place. Multiple times I have ordered a chicken pita and always same quality, slightly dry with a non crispy pita."}
{"text":"Pretty good Lebanese food for a food court. Especially for the price. Got the combo, which is a ton of food. Both the chicken and beef were tasty.."}
{"text":"Calm down with the 5 star review! It's okay, prefer mr falafel or the new shop on PFDS Blvd near Jaques Bizzare close to the Dominos (don't remember the name right now). However if on St. Charles it's a decent option. I find though they can be stingy with the chicken."}
{"text":"So it's been a year and I would like to make sure that some important observations are reviewed here.   Generally speaking their plates are very good. My big gripe is something that I let slide the first time I ate here probably because I was giving a beginners chance.  Well a year in the wife and I ran into asking for falafel and having it served cold to us. That's right, cold. When the mrs. asked why the falafel was not hot, we were told that it was optional. In every middle eastern/Mediterranean restaurant that I have been in, this is the only place that has informed me that hot falafel was optional. Worse yet, I'm pretty sure they heated it up in the microwave and it was dry. Too bad."}
{"text":"Rien contre la bouffe   Par contre, faite le total de votre facture avant de payer  il ajoute tous le temps 1$ de plus à la facture"}
{"text":"Rien de très extraordinaire, mais c'est un bon dépanneur lorsqu'on veut manger libanais et rapidement!"}
{"text":"The good - location and timings.  The bad - food and the service.   Ordered the chicken shawarma plate. The salad was the best part of the whole meal."}
{"text":"I love Middle Eastern food, and Basha is my favourite. The workers here are great. This is the one I always go to, even though I find this to be the second best Basha there is (with the first being the one on St. Catherine and Mansfield - right next to Sports Expert)."}
{"text":"Basha was in the right place at the right time,  sadly,  we were not.   Unable to go any longer without food , we stumbled in to Basha for some falafel-what could go wrong?   Everything.  The place was a disaster. Empty and filthy. I'd have thought it was abandoned had it not been for the sole employee watching the Jays game from another table.   He seemed relieved when we ordered the falafel wraps because,  luckily,  there were already some sitting under a heat lamp.  He quickly slapped the wraps together. They were cold,  dry,  and unsatisfying.   I could never, ever recommend this place.  Learn from our mistake,  avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Beef shawarma was no good -- poorly seasoned with overpowering sauce. The garlic potatoes were inedible; mushy potatoes with a goopy sauce. Avoid and go to Boustan instead."}
{"text":"Pretty good falafel sandwich!  For 5$ I'm not going to complain.  Place is clean and service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I work at the vape shop boulvapes and we order from them all the time. Great service and great food. Basha is a good place for a good eat. :)"}
{"text":"Very mom and pops type restaurant with a warm staff and fresh food. Can't beat the quality of this basha when beibn compared to any of the others! Try it out anytime you are around"}
{"text":"Great food. Good, quality fresh ingredients. Quick delivery. I love their Basha plate with a skewer of filet mignon, kafta kabob and chicken brochette served over rice and/or potatoes with salad."}
{"text":"Killer falafel and hummus, great vegetarian options... which is pretty unique in Montreal.  I got the 'vegetarian plate' which allowed a selection of 5 vegetable salads... The lentils/rice were a little dry, but the eggplant was amazing, as was the avocado and the chickpeas.  Pitas for free!  Plus they have diet cokes.  Convenient if you're in the Palais!"}
{"text":"Always have good experiences when I go. Pitas are nice and cheap, and full meals are a bit more pricey, but definitely tasty."}
{"text":"Great location downtown that is close to shopping and offices. If you want a quick lunch Basha has great fresh food at responsible prices."}
{"text":"If I could give this a negative star I would.  Worse than food court food.    My meal of mixed chicken and beef was so dry, flavorless and hard it was almost inedible.  The salad that came with it was so loaded with oily, salty dressing it was totally  inedible.  The only things on the plate that were remotely acceptable were the hummus and the rice (bland but edible).  My husband's meal (kafta) came out 34 minutes after we ordered and was RAW.  I asked for our money back for his order.  I was told there were no refunds and that it hadn't been 30 minutes.  I showed the guy the time on the receipt and the bloody raw kafta he relented and gave me the money back.     Awful, embarrassing experience, terrible food.  Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"The Basha next to sports experts now closed, their owners moved down here at the cinema. Same great food and quality with attractive enthusiastic personality.   With other options around like Amir, shawarmaz and Villa medina, this Basha stands on top."}
{"text":"Love the food here. The owners is really nice as well. You get huge portions of wholesome Lebanese food at competitive prices. Especially for a food court in Place Montreal Trust. Come by and check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Need food?  It was open later than most on a Sunday.  Plus, it was affordable."}
{"text":"Good food, but unfortunately not that clean. Once I saw the cashier take money and latter on make a shawarma with his bare dirty hands from the money. Anyway, I keep going there but taking a look for the cleaning. The shawarma is always awesome!"}
