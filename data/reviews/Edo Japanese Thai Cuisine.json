{"text":"Very good food, the highlight being the sushi. We tried a double tuna special roll which was excellent. We had their Thai for entrees, the Penang Curry, and Pad Thai. It was very good, not the best I've had, but nice to have a decent Thai option in this area. Would definitely come back and take advantage of the byob and enjoy some sushi!"}
{"text":"We've ordered take out twice from here and it wasn't that impressive.  The pad Thai was bland and the sushi was so so.  I had a red dragon roll and the fish on top did not look or taste like fish.  We were excited to have a Thai place close but I don't think we'll be eating there anymore."}
{"text":"Sushi and food are great. Desserts are amazing. The service is wonderful. So nice. We've been here twice and loved it both times."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and have always been very pleased.  The staff is so friendly and the food is always quick and delicious!! Reasonably priced too.  It's our new go-to for a sushi night."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short: The sushi was definitely not fresh. It was just... not. Egh. I chose not to finish the order. The pad thai was SUPER spicy... way spicier than it should be without a warning or an ask of \"how spicy would you like it?\"  Service was great - she was very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"It WAS good but appears to have closed.  Likely due to the poor location not the food.  People go to this strip mall for the garbage at BWW and a Subway sandwich."}
{"text":"Each time I have come here, I have ordered hibachi. Very great choice, in my opinion, and the prices aren't bad compared to other Japanese restaurants. However, I've noticed that a lot of people come here for the sushi. As for the hibachi, the portions are fairly large and come with your choice of salad or soup. The menu is what you would expect for a Japanese hibachi style restaurant even though the hibachi isn't cooked in front of you.  There are two reasons why I didn't rate this restaurant higher...first would be the temperature of the food...sometimes, the food has not been served quite as hot as I would've hoped. Second, the service when the restaurant is busy tends to be a lot slower, which is understandable. When this place gets backed up, the food takes much longer to arrive to the table. Otherwise, the servers definitely stay on top of checking to make sure you are satisfied, and on less busier days, the food obviously is prepared at a much more reasonable speed. I don't mind waiting for the food because at least I know that it is prepared properly, but this is not a \"get in and get out\" type of place.  It is a great addition to the area, and I have noticed a fair number of people using their take-out service. I plan to keep returning, and if you're in the mood for Thai cuisine, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice little place next to Buffalo Wild Wings. My wife and daughter really enjoyed the sushi and the soup. The pad Thai had a nice kick. Just enough heat that you knew it was there but not too much you couldn't eat and enjoy it. They offer a nice mix of sushi Thai and Japanese food. The staff was very attentive and friendly. It is nice to have something other than a another chain fast food place on route 8. Not the greatest but a nice change up from the same old same old. We look forward to seeing what else the menu has to offer."}
{"text":"We've gone to the Edo twice so far and intend to continue the practice.  The food was delicious, the wait staff and manager very friendly and helpful, with any and all questions asked answered clearly, and the ambiance is very nice. We're interested in trying new things, and having a Japanese-Thai sushi restaurant within a mile of us is a real delight!"}
{"text":"I've went there with my family today, and everything was amazing! Especially the sushi, all we've order was from the sushi bar. Everything was fresh, and the daily specials were so nice."}
{"text":"In one word; yum! How refreshing to have authenticity so close to home. Edo offers the very standard menu choices in Japanese and Thai cuisine; appropriate for this area. Presented artfully, the freshly prepared sushi was better than expected. We asked for a specific combination for one of the rolls and were so pleased that the staff was happy to accommodate. Yes, if you are looking for very reasonably priced, exceptional value, and to satisfy your sushi craving, then you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for sushi.  I'm happy to have a place I can go and eat out that's not too far from home.  The fish is fresh.  I've had food poisoning twice from eating sushi, so I'm always a little nervous trying something new.  Edo is clean, and the sushi bar looks well take care of.    II've had salmon sashimi, spicy tuna roll, a couple different rolls, and yellow tail sushi.  Each itime everything tasted good. I haven't had anything I haven't liked.  The wait staff is friendly.  The manager was helpful when I asked questions.  I will definitely be back again.  The one night I went, a lot of people were ordering the Thai food.  It smelled and looked great, but I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place in search of good Thai food, which in the Pittsburgh area, is very difficult. I must say that I am impressed. We've been there a few times and I never had a bad meal. I found the sushi to be as fresh as the better sushi places in the city and the Thai curry is very good. Definitely give them a shot, it's a good healthy alternative which again, is nearly impossible to find in and around Rte 8."}
