{"text":"Solid location; makes you feel displaced from the suburb surrounding area.  Coffee isn't making me twitchy yet, but it's only the first cup..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in madison! In the morning you can't go wrong with a breakfast sandwich & latte. Lunch time go-to is the hi ho hummus wrap! Don't miss the lobster bisque soup when they are serving it - it's the best!"}
{"text":"I visit the Fitchburg location at least once a week and the staff is great.  Where else can you find such a great selection of wines for under $10?  The staff has always gone above and beyond for me - whether it be putting together a wine basket, expediting my order because I'm in a hurry or making great wine recommendations."}
{"text":"Good selection of lunch or dinner offerings. Nice range of local beers and excellent range of wines. WiFi is free but can get slow when everyone shows up with a laptop. Usually enough space to sit but can be crowded around lunch some days. Easy parking. Friendly staff though there's a bit of turnover. Fireplace is nice in the winter."}
{"text":"All the wait staff is friendly, courteous, and helpful. The prices on both coffee and the retail side are not too bad; reflective of a local business intending to make a profit. 

The food has been good every time I've eaten here, and I have never heard any major complaints on that end.

They have decent roasts/blends that are sure to at least sooth the soul of someone who has ever sipped on a over-roasted cup of Starbucks coffee...
 
I love sitting by the fireplace to get work done. 

So what the hell Man? 2 stars? Yes. Let me tell you why I say so.

I have cased out the situation and find no fault in the employees, however I spy some flaws at the operations-management level that can make the sugar in my coffee taste, well-- a wee-bitter. As a matter of fact, today I have been reminded of that bitterness and it pissed me off. So, here I am writing an intentionally \"as-un-snarky-as-I could-get-myself-to-write\" Yelp review.

This area is one of the more financially well to do pockets of Madison. People not only come here to relax, but also to get work done. When work is getting done, when business deals are being made in proximity to this shop -- people spend more money. 

So come on, man. Get to the point, whydontya?

1) Let's cut the crap here: The internet sucks. Period. Yep. Ouch. That's the truth.
-not reliable enough to consistently make web-reliant work happen, or worse yet -- to faithfully complete a sales presentation. 
-Employees have been told [lied to, if you ask me] that this is as good as it gets (and I think some [by no fault of their own] might actually believe it).

2) The employees are not as valued by their employer as I think good people like those in this crew should be. Point of sale terminals that take credit cards at a coffee shop should be able to take tips. Anything less is a lack of respect and thoughtfulness for the prosperity and livelihood of those working here that support this seemingly thriving establishment. I find this as a loud indicator of deeper issues that could be addressed well by someone a little less dreamy and a little more rational; maybe a little bit of both would be nice, eh?

-The argument that some people paying for items from the retail side might take offense to a \"tip\" portion of their credit card receipt is Grade A bullshit, if you ask me. Most of the folks I see walking in and out of this place look like the kind of folks who can make a solid call while telling the difference. And, most of the folks I see look like the kind that have the money to leave a gratuity to the folks who treat them right, and the majority of them are not packing cash...damn the jokes."}
{"text":"If you could take all of the mediocre barrique's experiences and compress them into a big turd, that would have been today.  i just don't get the appeal of this place - is it just because every thing else is worse by comparison?  What a horrible reason to like something.  

so, it would seem as if Barrique's is trying to present themselves as some kind of euro-experience come to the midwest.  it has a nice, cozy, sit-down and come out of the cold feel.  so, i'll give it 1 star for ambiance.  they do have a (1) decent armagnac, and an assortment of wine, as well as a nice selection of sour beer.  so, that gets them another star.  

However, in all other ways, they just suck.  It's typical to get food that's subpar.  so, that goes without saying.  For example, a whole banana smeared with peanut butter and jelly, wrapped in an untoasted whole wheat tortilla.  i hope you understand that that's a bastardized peanut butter and jelly sandwich selling for $5?  that'd be appealing if I was 12, but, then i'd make it myself.  and if i was making it myself, i'd know enough to toast the damn thing, because if you don't, you get a mouthful of cold, mushy dough, without the contrasting texture of crispy, warm tortilla.  Or, how about, a couple pieces of chicken, fewer pieces of bacon, a loft of filler spinach, and enough ranch dressing to make you vomit, wrapped in, unsurprisingly, an untoasted tortilla?  Once again, cold, mushy dough.  Now, look at the menu, and picture this same scenario for every piece of food they sell that is wrapped in the sandwich cliche known as the tortilla.  if it helps add to the visual, imagine the salad greens are brown and slimy.  

Today, though, saw a whole new level of not giving a crap, with the gustatory experience that is the Barrique's Breakfast Sandwich.  This delicacy is billed as a \"fresh egg omelet with Hook's cheddar on a Barriques Breakfast roll.  Add Applewood bacon or sausage for $1.25\".  Well, in spite of that description, the bundle of joy I received was 1 single egg, unscrambled, with the yolk broken, and cooked hard, (for the record, it is generally recognized that 3 eggs is an omelet, 2 eggs a scramble, and 1 egg is bullsh*t), cheddar cheese that was obviously process garbage, a wee bit of ham that could have been a scrap that might have fallen off of a what one might imagine a real sandwich to be, all on a miniature hamburger bun.  Now, maybe this piece of bread was generously mislabeled as a dinner biscuit in the chain store it was purchased from, but, that doesn't change the fact that it had the same size and texture as a white castle hamburger bun.  All told, this massive taste sensation had the diameter of a silver dollar, and the flavor and texture of reheated Arby's hot ham and cheese.  It's diminutive size was starkly contrasted against the full sized dinner plate it was served on.  Now, some may say that the cheap price ($2.65) appeals to the homeless person in all of us, but, when you consider it would take 5 of these things to fill your stomach, and your stomach would shortly thereafter vomit the contents back onto that massive plate in protest, the whole thing reveals itself for lie that it really is.  The false promise of the american dream made manifest in the farcical breakfast sandwich that sat in front of me.  And then, to wash it all down, was a burned and acrid coffee, more bitter than anything even star bucks would ever dare to serve.  

sweet mother of god, people, get your sh*t together.  

Never again Barriques!  I'll be back for your one, good armagnac, that somehow made it on your shelves.  but, everything else is aptly summed up by your own motto \"wine for the masses, coffee for the people\".  Sorry, I'm not into cafeteria food."}
{"text":"I have spent a fair amount of time at the various Barriques locations studying. The Fitchburg location is my favorite because of its layout-- , comfy leather chairs to sink into with a book around the fire place, a store space that is pleasant to meander through, conversations that aren't painful to overhear (volume and content wise). It also pretty great for dates--options of coffee, wine and snacks and an atmosphere that invites you to stay. The only downside I've found is that the fireplace throws a lot of heat and it gets HOT right next to it."}
{"text":"Every Barriques has it's own atmosphere that fits the neighborhood and clientele and The Market is no exception. Inviting but professional, not a coffee shop vibe but more like a mercantile with a few tables. Food and coffee are fantastic as per usual with Barriques."}
{"text":"Love Barriques coffee and baked goods. Dislike how dirty the place is. Corners, window ledges are full of dirt and dust. Bathrooms aren't fresh. Would be my favorite coffee shop to be in if it was cleaner."}
{"text":"Very cozy, local coffee shop with inviting comfy chairs and reliable Wi-Fi. I like how everyone was very friendly and willing to make suggestions on which coffee was special that day and the favorites on the breakfast sandwiches.

Prices aren't too high-- $4 or so for a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich, and $2.20 for a cup of coffee (75 cents for refills though).

Perfect for getting some work done on a slow afternoon or reading the paper on a snowy Saturday morning. Really cool place."}
{"text":"Good coffee and nice people. :) I really like the small town atmosphere; I always run into a similar crowd in the morning. The breakfast is fresh and delicious and they are nice about substitutions. The coffee is also pretty good - I haven't found better in the area."}
{"text":"I like the variety and atmosphere of Barriques. It's one of my favorite places to hang out, especially with a fire in the fireplace. On the negative side, I have had better food and coffee elsewhere, but all told, Barriques has some wonderful offerings."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Madison. Cozy, usually quiet, wine, coffee, and a bigger menu of fresh/healthy food options than most cafes. Experienced baristas. Breakfast all day. A few beers on tap. Nothing bad to say about the service or atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was so pleased with the personal attention I got in picking out a gift for the beer drinker in my life. I brought in chocolates that needed beer pairings and the staff enthusiastically found me matches without breaking my bank account. They took time to label beers for the appropriate chocolates and packed my beers in easy to carry boxes. Awesome!

(Also, recently found my mom's favorite hard-to-find wine at Barriques.) 

Needless to say - stop for coffee, go gift shopping! Love."}
{"text":"The Fitchburg spot, is much like the other Barriques locations in and around Madison. The interior is a large and inviting space with tables and chairs, as well as plenty of soft seating. The outdoor patio is small, but I appreciate a place to sit and sip my coffee on a beautiful morning, as it was when my cycling group stopped by today. The cyclists in my group are all committed to spending our money locally and supporting the entrepreneurial spirit, so stopping at Barriques as we finished our morning ride was a no-brainer. However, we also support the Bicycle Benefits program which offers discounts at local businesses for those who travel via two-wheels and we were happy to see the sticker on the door indicating Barriques participation in the program. However, it was pretty disappointing when we ordered at the counter and were told Bicycle Benefits was not honored on weekends. Regardless, we were still in need of caffeination and snacks, so our group ordered some specialty coffees and breakfast sandwiches. The coffee was good, not spectacular and the breakfast sandwiches/wraps were sufficient; though considering the price point, they could have been more substantial."}
{"text":"Great dark roast coffee and breakfast sandwiches after my morning bike riding workout!"}
{"text":"Nope...the staff is grumpy...the sandwiches (if they come on a roll) are tiny and the roll is tough. The menu needs to rotate more. It's convenient, but not worth the hype. The baked goods are adequate, and the coffee is okay. Go there for the wine...the food....not so much!"}
{"text":"Great coffee house, wine/beer, and truly amazing food. Espresso drinks, salads, and wraps.  several locations around Madison, explore each locations unique vibe."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, comfortable and convenient for a quick bite and a coffee or for long study sessions. They have a friendly staff and their commitment to the community is evident. This is what a coffee shop should be. Their wine and other beverage selections are wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great wine selection,  good made on the spot food and yummy pastries and desserts.  There is a warm fireplace for winter and a nice sidewalk cafe for spring and summer time.  The coffee is stellar!  A great place to meet friends and catch up with a glass of wine or coffee."}
{"text":"We love to go here for the ambience and comfortable seating - the fireplace is a big plus.  The wine selection is great (love the $10 wall) and the staff seems very knowledgeable.  Love the Mexican mocha- just ask for a bit more spice and it's perfect hot or cold. 

This rating would have been a solid 4 except for the food, which - in more than a dozen visits - has never failed to disappoint.  It's overpriced, portion sizes are small, and I once even found wax paper in my sandwich. If you go in with the munchies, stick with the baked goods.  If you're looking for something more substantial, go next door for some fantastic Thai.  Too bad I can't just bring that in and have the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Love stopping in here for a quick bite, or a bottle of wine for dinner, or just a cup of coffee. Great food and they really know their stuff. They are always spot on with their wine recommendations. Plus good cheeses, beer, coffee, chocolate ... they seem to have just what I need."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, unorinary sandwich or salad, a lingering cup of coffee or a beer, or to pick up a bottle of wine for dinner. Friendly, unpretentious help with wine, beer, and spirits, too!"}
{"text":"This is a happy 3 1/2 star experience for me. 

We wanted something light for dinner and this fit the bill. 

We ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken wrap ($7) and upgraded the side to the Roasted Vegetables soup (+$2.50) and the Cuban ($7).

You get a choice of side with the sandwich, pasta salad, mixed greens, chips or the soup upgrade. They have Zapp's chips,  made in Louisiana and incredibly addicting - just try the voodoo flavor! 

While we waited on the store, we heard something being reheated in the microwave. I understand this is not a full service restaurant and thus not everything is made fresh. 

The wrap seemed to contain the retreated, pre-cooked chicken,  such as the carving board Oscar Mayer version you can buy at your local grocery store. The BBQ sauce was sweet and complimented the greens,  bacon and chicken. 

The soup was a disappointment, a puree of unrecognizable green mush, lacking any remote excitement of flavors. 

The Cuban was correctly pressed in Cuban bread, but could have stood to use more meat. The mustard had an overwhelming, sinus inducing amount of horseradish that distracted from the sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a great and cozy place close to my parents home. It's nice to go and meet friends and just relax. Going off what Ky S. said, the staff at the Fitchburg location is particularly rude. There are always 2-3 people in there doing other things than monitoring the register. I will stand there for a good 5 minutes just to have them pour a cup of regular old coffee for me... I never order anything fancy. Other than the staff being careless human-beings its an excellent place to relax after a long day in big comfy leather chairs and couches and just have a nice conversation."}
{"text":"The food is OK but overpriced for the drinks are hard to find in these layout of the restaurant is less than desirable... I will have to go back in and look over the line but the service I received did not warrant a second trip so I guess the mood will have to hit me before I come back"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Biked here (right along the paved trail) and got the Biker's Dream Breakfast Wrap: Peanut butter, strawberry jelly, granola, peaches, and bananas in a whole wheat wrap! Phenomenal and unique. 

The rest of the store is great too. Excellent low/mid priced wine selection with lots of worldly wines (not just CA), great beer selection, cool cheeses, unique gifts, etc.

Open a Bariques in Denver please!"}
{"text":"Like my living room only they foam the milk for me.  The only place in town that makes a latte superior to my own. Friendly baristas, comfortable seating, fireplace, NYT...this is good."}
{"text":"Update: The Morning Bun is divine and made my morning extra happy. That's all."}
{"text":"Great coffee! I wouldn't eat there again. Very unimpressed. Ordered there breakfast Sammy and upgraded it (comes with egg, dry roll and cheddar) added avocado & bacon and it was so disappointed. The bacon was the gross microwave kind and avocado was a shear of maybe a tablespoon that I spent 1.25$ just to add avocado! 
Just stick with coffee :)"}
{"text":"How anyone can rate this place higher than 2 is beyond me. This (and other Barriques) are filthy dirty.  Just walk in Fitchburg location and look around, start with floor, windows, area around \"fireplace\". Come on, hire someone if you don't care! Besides the dirt, the prices are out of whack. Sorry to be such a hater but everything is 25% higher for same beer, liquor and yes, fancy sandwiches anywhere else and....prepared on what appears to be starter kitchen. The employees are super nice and some knowledgeable. The \"wall\" speaks volumes and should be Barriques moniker; everything $10; if you can stand the filth."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, really cute coffee shop with assortment of cheeses, sandwiches and brunch items. Also serve alcohol such as Bloody Mary's, whisky, and craft beers. Also have a beer and wine store. I had a dirty chai tea latte very delicious, a slice of pumpkin chocolate chip bread which was gd amazing!!!  And also a veggie crustless quiche, I really wish they had available quiche's with crust because I actually love gluten and gluten is my friend, but that aside the quiche was very good and they have a lot of gluten-free and dairy-free options."}
{"text":"Love this place.  More than your average coffee place, with food, and a great selection of wine, beer.  Kind of a half coffee house, half cool liquor store, and cafe.  Always room, always relaxed, great staff.  Don't leave without the breakfast sandwich with ham.  I will be the best you ever had."}
{"text":"The Barriques I fell in love with.
This is my favorite location.  I love the atmosphere, the staff, the quality coffee and food, and the fabulous selection of wine, beer, liquors and a wall of refrigerated cases of cheese, sausages and beverages ready to go for your picnic or party.
They have an excellent menu for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Sandwiches, soup, salads, and yes even alcoholic and caffeinated drinks too! YES!
Cozy up to the fireplace when it is cold, grab a table for a coffee meeting or hang outside with a glass of wine.  
The original wall of wine, shelf upon shelf of more wine, liquors, crackers, and other items to go along with your drinks.  Don't be afraid to ask for help =the staff is super knowledgeable. 
It's been over seven years and we're still going steady.  Don't change, I love you."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! It can be crowded at times but that's because the coffee and compliments are so good. Nice place to meet socially as well as for business."}
{"text":"E-MAIL WINE DEALS - I've been buying some of the email wine specials for about 3 years and I find they're nearly always a solid value. The \"descriptive narratives\" give the old wine thesaurus a hot yoga style workout and make one wonder just where the authors developed their remarkable palates. They pick up flavors like \"brambles,\" \"black caps\" and \"briary\" (there go the \"b\"s!). I think my favorite, used in a positive way, was something about \"as aromatic as a southern Georgia high school prom.\" I'd recommend getting the emails just to learn a few good crazy flavor descriptors to drop at your next wine event - and who knows - maybe you will detect some \"defined red berry fruits,\"  \"infused minerals,\" or \"  toasted wood spice.\"  And in any case, almost every wine I've purchased has ranged from good to very good and a couple bordered on great buys. On one occasion I found the wine with virtually nothing I liked (I bought 6 bottles) - they took it back without a hassle. As they should.  So my recommendation is to sign up for the reading and try a few wines."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food has always been delicious.  I hear it gets very busy at most lunchtimes.  I was there today on a Saturday afternoon and it was very UN-busy, so that was pleasant.  The staff was friendly.  The choices were great.  I had the Johnny Appleseed quesadilla - Granny Smith apples and brie cheese in a quesadilla with cantaloupe salsa along with a cup of roasted vegetable soup.  I really liked the quesadilla but the salsa was not impressive.  The idea was good, the cantaloupe just didn't have a lot of flavor.  It was a beautiful day and we sat outside on the sidewalk.  Being off the street there weren't many people walking by our table, which is an issue for me sometimes if we sit outside.
They also have a fun selection of wines, beers and cheeses."}
{"text":"The food isn't my favorite to be honest, but the coffee is good and the service competent.  Great place to study."}
{"text":"I have been very pleased coming here. Their beer/wine/liquor selections are wonderful. Food and coffee is also great. Will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Again, crabby staff.  Out of iced coffee.  Something weird about this place but can't put my finger on it."}
{"text":"All of their food is great. Coffee drinks are good but very flavorful. Atmosphere is perfect. Service can be slow during peek hours."}
{"text":"Barriques on McKee is my cozy go-to spot for a quick, healthy lunch or a cup of joe during my workdays. Although they don't have any vegan pastries (my favorite) that I know of, they have a delicious Mediterranean plate with hummus, olive tapenade, and pita. Their garden wrap and Hi-Ho hummus sandwich both sans cheese are delicious and filling. Every time I have been there they have vegan chili on the menu as well. Perfect to have next to the fireplace if you can grab that spot! If you're not sure of the dairy content of something on the menu, the baristas are always happy to check the ingredient list for you.

Barriques also has a nice tea list to choose from and some nondairy milk options for your coffee drinks. Of course, Barriques is  known for their \"wine for the people,\" offering a tantalizing array of wines and spirits that you might as will peruse as you wait for your hummus wrap and ginger tea. There's a good chance that you will leave with a bottle or two. (Remember, vegans, you can use the app called Barnivore to make sure your wine doesn't use animal bones in their production.)

Thanks, Barriques, for your friendly staff yummy food and wine! And of course for your fireplace."}
{"text":"Coffee, wine and hard liquor.  Plus their food is good and does not arrive frozen.

Plenty of seating, staff is fine, wifi is free.  Its not as fun as their Hogwarts downtown location, but its ok."}
{"text":"They have so many different wines to try and their food is delicious! A nice little place to drop in for some coffee and a book."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've been in fitchburg/madison for year and am still experiencing new places! Barriques had amazing service and the food was so good! I had the tuna melt and there are options for almost all sandwiches-- melt or regular so that's always nice to have options. I also had soup and it was really great and unique compared to soups you can get everywhere else. Great atmosphere, good prices, and literally is a market so options are endless."}
{"text":"Great place to study or unwind with a nice glass of wine. The wine selection is impressive and they have local spirits from Old Sugar Distillery."}
{"text":"I love Barriques and spend a lot of time in their shops. This one has a nice ambiance and - as with all of them - the food and service are both great.

This said, the WiFi in this location is AWFUL. I spent the better part of my time here trying to get and stay on the network. I literally watched in my preferences as it connected, and then it would spit me out within a minute or two. This is the third time this has happened to me here.

I mentioned this to the desk staff, and they said it's a common complaint that has been brought to management and the owners. So maybe it's time to fix it."}
{"text":"I prefer buying local and usually have a better experience at Barriques. This wasn't good. They have some comfy leather chairs by the fireplace, which was off in the middle of January. I've sat on wood outhouse seats that were more comfortable. The springs and cushioning in this chair had long given out and you sank into the frame with the wood frame digging into your sides. I mentioned it to staff and they were frustrated because management knows about it and doesn't do anything. It appears that staff are tired of hearing complaints about this, but management will not do anything. Can you say cheap? Also, one of the two staff I interacted with seemed to have an edge that was a little short and cranky. When you're food is ready they scream it out like a prison. How you say something has a huge impact on how people feel. When I picked up the sandwich the script for choosing the chips isn't friendly. Instead of, \"what type of chips would you like\", it's \"make sure to pick up your chips\" like I was a forgetful child. You can do better."}
{"text":"Coffee, beer, wine... OH MY! Barriques has it all, including the scent of delicious food. We stopped in here for a quick cup of coffee prior to a nail appointment and what a treat.

The gentlemen told us that Barriques is local to Madison, and now we've seen them all about town. I had a dirty chai tea latte, and my mother in law had a latte. The chai tea latte was delicious, and reminded me of a nice fall day. It is August, but I don't get to drink these warm drinks in the heat of Florida very often. They had some fun concoctions on the menu with and without alcohol. 

If I lived in the area, I'm certain that I'd find myself using this place as my working space from time to time. 5 stars for Barriques concept and chai tea latte!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be.  Looks like this place has met with tough times.  The gift shelves are poorly stocked where they once had a number of creative gift ideas, stocking stuffers, mugs and the like.   Now just a few scraps left there from last year.   Sure, the wine and cheese is good but the service has been moderate to poor my last few stops. 
I recently waited for quite some time along with some other people.  No one acknowledged any of us to at least say, \"be right with you\".  I finally just left without buying anything.   
Sadly, I have to lower my rating for this place by three stars."}
{"text":"Coffee selection is sparse, but the java is pretty decent.  It tries to be cozy but it is a market.  The place is packed to the gills with wine, liquor, and other goods for purchase.  My complaint is that the establishment, especially around the counter area, is entirely too cluttered.  Because of the clutter and overall cleanliness, I felt a sense that this place wasn't sure what it really wanted to be.  A cafe? A bar/liquor store?  I didn't trust the idea of ordering anything edible.

I spent a good hour there with my wife reading the news, sipping coffee, before giving the shop a once-over.  I did purchase a bottle of wine for her.

If the mood strikes, I might return though to be fair this place didn't really speak to me in that way."}
{"text":"After waiting more than 30 minutes for our food we found that it had been sitting out for 15 minutes. We asked to have them remake the order (2 sandwiches, soup and salad). After another 20 minutes and a request for a refund our order was ready. The food was ok but not worth the wait nor the attitude of the service staff. They were snide and unhelpful. They should do a much better job in training the staff."}
{"text":"Hmmm...been coming here for the past several years and never once did I write a review.  Must be off my Yelp game a bit.

Barriques is a local coffee roaster and cafe with several locations in the Madison area.  I happen to think the location in Fitchburg is the best-not only because I live nearby but I feel the setup and the staff make it that way.  

Great coffee, solid food (try the Biker's Dream Wrap) and an amazing wine selection (and a slightly smaller beer selection).  

Tip:  You can buy and drink there anything you purchase without any corkage fee."}
{"text":"Okay their breakfast wraps are awesome, their coffee drinks are awesome, they have a great selection of everything alcoholic. The interior is super rustic. This is my favorite location. I give it a thousand hearts and hugs."}
{"text":"Great coffee, food, atmosphere & wine! Also, RICE. KRISPIE. TREATS. These people know coffe, always grind it right to go,no matter your home brew contraption, and offer a great selection of fresh coffees.. LOVE."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a place that serves coffee and alchohol.   I mean you can can start and end your day here.  What's there not to like?   The staff is alway pleasant, the crowd is diverse, and the pastries are pretty decent.  I come here to study sometimes and to steal wifi when I need to focus.  I can stay here for hours and get lost in my own world here.  

I was here last night and it also appears that they have wine tastings.  Didn't inquire about it but it is def on my to do list.  They also have a magnificent selection of tea, at least I think so, based on my limited knowledge of tea.  

This place has become a staple in my life and I'm never disappointed with the service or products offering.  Keep up the great work Barriques!"}
{"text":"Yeah pretty good. Decent lattes (could be stronger), often good wine selection. Not as good as some people say. Good food though.  If you need real food and coffee at the same time, then yes worth it. If it's 10 to 9 and you need wine, yes, worth it. Exceptions: toffee cookies, and Oko prosecco. 

A quick update, while I generally enjoy their breakfast wraps, I was left with a distinct ho-hum feeling after having their grilled cheese the other day. Although it was, in fact, tasty, it was just about what I manage to make at home. For the price, it was very small and nothing special. Breakfast wraps it is then"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, good local food, comfy seating, and overall great atmosphere. I love Barriques!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! We never new about this place before and it's so calm and nice. Great place for coffee, sandwich or cup of soup. Also - endless verity of wine selection with good price. 
The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because.....bathroom needs to be perfectly clean. And it's not."}
{"text":"I stop here every time I'm in Madison. I appreciate their distribution throughout the city and suburbs. Barriques is never too far out of the way to pop in for a cortado. The high quality of their espresso and skill of their baristas keeps me coming back. My favorite location is in Fitchburg. I can typically get some gift shopping completed in the wine/beer/gift shop."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go and have drinks with friends, or work during the week.

Good Points:

- Great atmosphere, and very friendly staff.

- For the gluten-free and/or dairy-intolerant among us, they now have ALMOND MILK for their drinks! I can start drinking chai again!

- Most locations, including this one, have not just a fireplace to warm up in the winter, but also copious outdoor seating to enjoy during the summer as well.

Needs Improvement:

- Their wifi can be a bit flaky, and even moreso when it gets busy.

- I wish they'd offer some GF options for food/baked goods that weren't just \"here, have a salad.\" GF baked goods on the menu would make going there complete!

**2016 Update:** Success! They've updated their offerings to include GF baked goods from the Silly Yak bakery, as well as gluten free wraps and bread, so how the gluten intolerant among us can now enjoy all of the wraps and sandwiches and not always be relegated to salad land!"}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and his friend went to see a movie at Star Cinema. I had some work I needed to get done and didn't particularly want to see the movie, so I set out to find a coffee shop where I could get a good bite to eat and work.

Barriques Market was SUPER close and totally fit the bill. They had a decent sized menu and I definitely had to think for a little bit before I decided on the Hi-Ho Hummus sandwich with greens and an iced tea.

The sandwich tasted fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette tossed greens were nice and crisp. The iced tea was also good. I will admit, the sandwich was a little tangy for my taste ('twas the sun dried tomato hummus) , but it didn't stop me from devouring it. I was really hungry and it wasn't bad. I would probably get something else next time, but that's just me.

Anyways, after dinner I decided to try their herbal blueberry Rishi tea. Pretty tasty!

The atmosphere was quite cozy. The staff was also really nice. The overall experience was great and I will definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to sit for a glass of wine, or in my case, a nice Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel Stout. Yum! Nice patio in the summer, and nice fireplace in the winter. Relaxed intimate atmosphere. Bummer when it's crowded, though. Wanted to keep it secret. Can't figure out why someone would say they love Barriques, then give them one star since the Wi-Fi was sketchy...."}
{"text":"I like the casual feel of this place. A great place to go to the cooler, grab yourself a beverage (alcoholic or not) out of the cooler, order some food and hang out with friends. Their sandwiches and salads are pretty good. Nice portion size and a good variety of choices. Vegetarian options available too. They do have some outdoor seating. Unfortunately, you are overlooking the parking lot while you sit outside. The bike racks are down the sidewalk, if needed. This is a great little stop near the SW commuter bike trail. Love their coffee drinks and pastries in the morning (or for an afternoon treat). They have a great wall of affordable, yet very tasty, wines. If liquor is your thing, they do host liquor tastings periodically (i.e. scotch tastings). This is a great way to learn about the different brands of a certain liquor without having to buy a whole bottle to see which one you may like the best. The tastings are pretty informational and give you some info on the different brands, but also about the liquor itself."}
{"text":"If we had a Barriques in Chicago, I would never go to to any other coffee shop ever again. 

I only had the opportunity to try some coffee while I was there (though friends had lots of good things to say about the beer and wine they carried) and the quality was just far superior to any national chain you could visit. The flavor was deep without being burnt and I enjoyed a few hours sipping on coffee and using their free wifi. Loved it."}
{"text":"Can't decide between a hot mocha or a glass of wine for your mid-afternoon study break? At Barriques, you don't have to choose! Who says you can't double fist with an espresso shot in one hand and rose wine in the other?

If I wasn't a Starbucks gold card holder...you know that I would be here 24/7 with my Belly card. The hipster-esque environment offers this wannabe hipster (me) a nice respite from the all-too-suburban west side of Madison. The coffee is a nice, strong brew, and the crowd is of an older, scholarly sort. All pluses in my book. :) Also, I can see the random assortment of bar supplies and wine glass ornaments being a nice distraction from whatever work/studying I may find myself doing at Barriques.

The yelp check-in deal for 50% off any coffee or espresso drink was also a very pleasant surprise. I'm not sure how long this is going to last - but I'd suggest that all ya'll yelpers take advantage of it while it lasts!"}
{"text":"I was in an out while heading out of Madison from an Epic conference. No, not a great epic conference, a conference at Epic. But this place seemed pretty epic. Leaving Epic, and making the epic journey towards Chicago, we stopped in here to get some epic beer that you cannot buy in Chicago. Ok, mainly spotted cow (which comes in cans now) but I did pick up a six pack of Fantasy Factory IPA that has an epic picture of a cat with gun, riding on a fire breathing unicorn. 

Ok, so I walked around the store a bit, seems like a pretty cool place. Go check it out, the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I stop at this branch of Barriques pretty regularly. The tea is fantastic (I'm not a coffee drinker) and I love the food. If I'm just looking for a snack, the hummus plate is one of my favorites, but the sandwiches, soups and pastries are also quite good.

There are tables, comfy chairs and a couch to choose from. The fireplace is clearly popular based on other reviews; so it might be difficult to find a spot near it. I've never noticed it too loud; people are usually working, studying or having intimate conversations. I've seen small groups there holding what appeared to be planning sessions, or knitting together. What's not to like about that kind of atmosphere? I would say that the location isn't very large, so while they can accommodate groups, I'd keep it small.

The staff are fantastic. I've never had any problems in that area - even when out with folks who have food restrictions.

While I have a few favorite places to stop for tea, this is nearly always my first choice for meeting friends in Madison after work."}
{"text":"This just in y'all your one pound bag is 50% off when you check in on Yelp. And that rocks my socks off right now considering I have an unhealthy relationship with their Eye Opener!"}
{"text":"I really like this Barriques, especially the market feel and ambience.  I often stop in for a morning bkfst sandwich before work.  The lattes are yummy.  My two complaints are not enough seating (it can be quite crowded during busy times) and sometimes it seems the cooks are a little too relaxed and the wait for a simple sandwich is too long."}
{"text":"Constructive criticism is overdue for one of Fitchburg's fabled hangouts.  The beer, wine and liquor collection is overshadowed by Steve's just down McKee.  The food is lack-luster in a region now rivaled by HyVee and a decent PUB by Target.  Coffee is a nice feature, but nothing you can't get at EVP, Starbuck's or HyVee.  Ambience is really just so so.  Yeah, the fireplace is nice but limited seating means it's a maybe and the seats aren't great.  The old friendly atmosphere suffers from generally poorly paid and under appreciated employees who would rather work somewhere that treats their customers like kings and their employees like human beings, not robots.  Cleanliness is definitely on the low end of the sanitation spectrum, bring your Purell.  I have heard from multiple people who have had gastrointestinal upset following food at Barriques...hmmmm?  I'm not a fan.  Sometimes honesty is tough to write.  This one comes naturally.  Choose another place to spend your hard earned cash."}
{"text":"Ew. So dirty! Are you 5-star people not looking around? There is a strong sense that no one gives a crap. Paint falling off the walls, crooked pictures, shelves half empty and/or product apparently launched onto shelves from a great distance, sticky stuff on every surface, dust bunnies bigger than my dog, and my top complaint - ice cold water in the bathroom. It's been that way for years. There is no way employees are working up a good lather before getting back to work. 

Don't let the cozy fireplace fool you. Ew."}
{"text":"I stopped at Barriques one evening a few weeks ago with some girl friends. We were only in there for about a half hour for a quick glass of wine and some chit-chat before a movie.

It was my first time at this Barrique's location and I was surprised by it. I loved all of the wine options (heaven, really.) and I was tempted to also order a coffee drink since they all looked pretty wonderful as well. There was plenty of seating, but still quite a few people there for a Wednesday evening. The service was great - very friendly employees!

Too bad Fitchburg is quite a hike from Sun Prairie. If it wasn't, I'm sure I'd be a Barrique's regular."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to treat myself randomly on a weekday morning!  I adore the Mexican Mocha and all of your breakfast wraps!  I also found some unique gifts to bring back to NY around the holidays!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Fitchburg and Middleton locations of Barrique's.  The lattes are excellent, staff is fun and friendly, and the wine selection is impressive.  Oh yeah, and they have free wi-fi!  In the winter, the fireplace is burning and I love the ambiance in general.  I disappeared for over six-months (went to live in France) and when I came back, the manager remembered me!  I haven't had very many food items from them, but what few things I've had have all been great.  They also have a great beer selection - very unique stuff.  I love the atmosphere and I'm happy that we have several in town!  Thanks everyone, and see you all again real soon!

{"text":"I have been going to Barriques for over a year now. They make a wicked mocha! It absolutely fantastic day-in and day-out. Some of the baristas are super nice, and some look like they do not want to be there. But to be fair, that will be the case no matter where you go. 
Their kitchen stays quite busy and the smoke builds up to an uncomfortable level. Surprisingly, this was never an issue over the summer months. I had trouble with this last week, so much so that my eye were watering profusely. I thought it might have just been me. But it was the same today, so I went to the young woman in the kitchen and asked her politely, \"Hi, I can see you are super busy, but I was wondering if all your vents are open. The smoke is beginning to get thick in here\". She replied quite disinterestedly, saying that its \"the steam\" because they were \"boiling vegetables\". Hmmm.....I was kind of surprised at her 'go-away-cant-you-see-i'm-busy-and-i-couldn't-care-less' face. So I just packed up and left. 
Best case scenario, its a combination of the heating and food volume. As for the young lady who was visibly unhappy, I hope she cheers up some. I m not returning there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop / wine/beer/liquor store. Still love Barriques for coffee/tea, unique wine-related gifts, and their beer and wine selection. It's a nice place to meet a friend for coffee (or wine!). 

However, I felt like I needed to update my review since I don't recommend eating there anymore.  The food has been pretty bad for the last year or so. I've had a lot of issues with food temperatures (hot foods like soups/sandwiches being lukewarm). The sandwiches have also gone downhill. They changed up the bread a while back and it has been super dense (rather than fluffy), and the amount of bread overpowers the rest of the sandwich."}
