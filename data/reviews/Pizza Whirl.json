{"text":"The pizza crust is prepared fresh and rolled in corn meal as you watch, the ingredients were fresh, and for $9 (unlimited veggies)...how can you go wrong? Staff was friendly, pizza cook time was 3min flat, perfectly done, and delicious. Garlic knots were on point as well! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas from here recently.  Not my taste, overly greasy and layered with salty garlic butter. I enjoy the simple taste of pizza and prefer not to have a layer of fat and salt overpower everything else. Crust also soft and droopy."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself in Ohio city and are looking for a good pizza , this is the place to go . They have a list of all types of different pizzas and salads and you can also create your own . I had the arugula bianca and it was one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever had . It had a ricotta garlic cheese sauce with fresh mozzarella, baby arugula , prosciutto and it was drizzled with truffle oil. It was also reasonably priced , for a 12 inch pizza it was only $10.95. The staff was very friendly and the pizza came out fairly quickly . I can't wait to go back and try the mushroom madness pizza ! I highly recommend Pizza Whirl !"}
{"text":"My son noticed this pizza place which we decided to try and boy am I glad we did.The pizza is absolutely delicious and priced well. You can get up to 3 meats and unlimited veggies for your pizza.Everything is so fresh and they make the pizza in front of you The owner is very nice and it is a family owned business. Do yourself a favor and go try this great place! Afterwards, help spread the word so we can keep this hidden gem going"}
{"text":"I ordered a simple pepperoni pizza for $6.95. The place was empty at lunchtime. The ladies were kind and attentive. As promised, the pizza was prepared, cooked, in a box, and in my hand in under 5 minutes.   The pizza was VERY good. I would certainly pay the extra $1 to go here and get a pizza that tastes fresh and real versus the $6 large pizza at the chains.   Nice job!"}
{"text":"This pizza has brought Mediterranean essences from small villages in Italy to Cleveland W25 St. Stone oven and wood baked it's no wonder that this is the best pizza in town. Definitely a favorite pie. Thanks for Frank's generosity holding my dog I was able sit down and enjoy one of these master pieces. Great job guys. Adrian"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Great value for a pizza made to order and made quickly. This is a perfect grab and go spot for a quick meal on W 25th. In an area full of table service bars and restaurants this is a great fast casual addition. Pizza was cooked perfectly. Crispy crust, hot toppings. I have nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Tasty, super fast and super affordable. Feel like we found a hidden treasure.  Staff was very friendly and we got a 12-inch(ish? I forgot to ask/measure) margherita for 8.95 in 3 minutes.  They do custom pizzas from scratch, and the dessert option sounds awesome.  Inside is clean and bright.    Perfect for late night / post-bar snacking.  Also perfect for anyone who likes pizza at amazing prices.  Is it the best pizza in Cleveland?  Nah.  But EASILY the best at this price.  I would go again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"There was a void that was to be filled in OHC....Pizza Whirl is here to fill it. Efficient. Delicious. Quick.. what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Very impressed with everything about this place-the food, the service, the atmosphere all exceeded my expectations! Great addition to the Ohio City community."}
{"text":"Great pizza and SUPER-FRIENDLY staff!  All ingredients are fresh, and home-made.  Locally owned, too.  They even give you an option on sauce: spicy or not spicy.  (I went with spicy!). Then, you can pick out your toppings, and they're fresh and on display at the counter. Nice, open atmosphere with TV's to follow the game. Gluten Free options ... and the crust is awesome!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The mushroom madness pizza is amazing. It is loaded with tasty mushrooms and the porcini mushroom cream sauce/mozzarella combo is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Pizza whirl has unlimited toppings! They make awesome medium size pizzas that have fresh ingredients and cook for you in just a couple minutes! Everyone here is really friendly - not to mention they have the best gluten free pizza crust in Cleveland and they're right across the street from Mitchell's for ice cream after. :)   Om nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious wood-fired pizzas and fast!  You can dine-in or pick up.  Very clean, welcoming and friendly.  A perfect addition to W. 25th Street.  I hope they open more locations for all of us Foodie's around town. Nice job. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Pizza Whirl pretty much blew my mind! Just by the name and outside appearance, it looks like generic cheap pizza one would enjoy only after a wild night out. But to my surprise, you walk in and the menu outlines signature pizzas and gives the customer a wallet friendly opportunity to create a sophisticated pizza masterpiece. There's fresh and smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, roasted garlic and other higher end toppings that I wasn't initially expecting. Once you create your custom pizza, it takes about 3 mins max for it to be served. There aren't a lot of frills around the restaurant but it's quality pizza at a great price. Similar offerings around town would cost ~2x as much."}
{"text":"Very tasty hand-made pies. Really enjoyed the King pizza, and my daughter had a custom pizza with ranch as the sauce - not my style, but really good. Also serving salads, wings, garlic knots, and gluten free crust. The Whirld's best dessert pizza with Nutella and fruit is really good too."}
{"text":"Pizza Whirl has a small dine-in area and almost a Subway-like feel to it, where you get in line and can order a pizza with anything you'd like on it, or choose from their menu. Pizzas come out hot and fresh! Their garlic knots were especially good. This is the kind of place that will thrive since it's open so late, and the perfect place to eat after a few drinks."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows I'm obsessed with pizza so when Pizza Whirl opened up I was so excited!   When we walked in we were greeted by the nicest women in the world!  She asked us if we have ever been there, and when we said no she explained everything on the menu and the ordering process.  I don't know what is was about her, but I could have sat and chatted with her all day because she was so nice and friendly :)  Because we were only here for a snack my husband and I decided to share a pizza instead of getting our own.  Everything sounded good to me so I told him to decide because he's so damn picky lol.  After looking over the menu he decided to go with the arugula bianca pizza.  It had fresh mozzarella, ricotta, garlic cheese sauce, arugula, prosciutto, parmigiano-reggiano and truffle oil.  It was tasty, but nothing special.  Maybe I'm being hard on them because I'm from Chicago and I'm kind of a pizza snob.  Maybe it was because it was something I normally wouldn't have ordered and I let my husband decide.  Either way the pizza was good, but nothing to write home about.  This is why I decided to give the them 4 out of 5 starts, 3 for the food and 5 for the service. If you're in the area and craving pizza I definitely recommend you stop in and give them a try.  It's super fast, cheap, tasty and amazing service!  Also, Pizza Whirl is open until 3am Friday and Saturday.  I'll definitely be returning for some late night pizza next time I'm out drinking in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is even better. The people treat you like family and give you the best service. Highly recommend for anybody out there looking for some amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken, roasted peppers and fresh spinach pizza and let me tell you.. It was absolutely delicious! The sauce is not made with tomatoes. And everything tastes so fresh. Not really expensive either. I gave it four stars because the outer crust can be a lil burnt at times, but overall.. Very good. If your looking for some good pizza, Pizza whirl is it."}
{"text":"OMG! So delicious!!!! All the toppings are fresh and tasty! The restaurant was very clean and all the employees were so helpful and kind! We will definitely be going back for more! Yay for a fabulous pizza place in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"Wow, I had this place late Saturday night and I mean like 1:30am late. Everything was super fresh and made to order. Very surprising that late at night. I chose the build your own pizza option (crust is gluten free) I had lotsssss of cheese pepperoni mushrooms tomatoes and a garlic sauce Ughhh so good. Seems like a family owned business and everyone was super helpful and friendly. Definitely will be back. Love that they're open late!!!"}
{"text":"New spot in Ohio city I had to try and let me say it was amazing the staff is so friendly and everything was so clean love love love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family on Father's Day for a quick snack. The Margherita pizza was like a flatbread and AMAZING. Rivals any flatbread pizzas I get at Town Hall or Market Garden.. in fact, prob better, because we smashed the first pie and had to go back and ordered a second pie! Great service, clean location, good crowd."}
{"text":"FAST, delicious pizza! Thin crust with perfect topping ratios and totally affordable. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"A great addition to W 25th for cheap late night food option. We had the arugula bianca which was tasty and definitely enough for two moderately hungry people. The crust was nice and chewy and comparable to some of the other $$$$ pizza spots in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great addition to West 25th! Delicious, fresh pizza made in less than 5 minutes. Super friendly staff and great service !! Will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Quick cooking pizza! Choose your own or from 6 premades. They're fantastic. Cornmeal dusted and also gluten free options.  Unusual toppings like zucchini, or parsley mushrooms. It's delicious! They're open late than most non restaurant bars. No delivery though."}
{"text":"It was so good friendly service great pizza I'm a picky eater so I loved their options!!! New n upcoming can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Cleveland, wake up!!! I hate how nothing is open late in Cleveland and no one else seems to mind because they are all at home sleeping already. Especially on Sunday evenings, there is literally next to nothing open to get food or drinks. In the whole city there might be a handful of restaurants and bars open.  Pizza whirl is one of these amazing additions to the City that I can only wish and pray will stick around. I want to tell as many people as I can about this place because I want them to get business so that they will be able to stay open forever here. Their Pizza is delicious. The dough is just the right chewy , it comes out super quick, you can put whatever ingredients you want on there, with lots of options for veggies and meats, the price is so good, and this family-owned business is so friendly. I went on a Sunday night, there wasn't much other business as far as I could tell. They're open until 11 p.m. on Sunday. But you can tell that they will probably be closing at 10 soon because they're just as in the business. So here I am to tell all of Cleveland please visit Pizza whirl after 9 p.m. on Sundays!!"}
{"text":"Best #glutenfree pizza in #Cleveland! Eating at Pizza Swirl is like walking into your family's kitchen. We were greeted so enthusiastically and the order style is cafeteria. We were able to participate in our custom pizzas! I ordered The King. Highly recommend this amazing neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't give one stars out lightly.  What in the flying f@$% are you 5 star reviewers jazzing out about???  This place is drunk food that generally wont kill you from food poisoning.  So terrible in terms of crust to sauce to topping ratio, so fast food-esque.  I'm so dissapointed yelp doesn't pay closer attention to fake reviews....because this place doesn't add up."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and tasty food for a great price. The quality of the pizza is similar to pizza at Vosh in Lakewood, but half the price. Your pizza is customizable with toppings from egg to capers. I ordered a pie that was half buffalo chicken and half white pizza with the toppings I chose (bacon, red onion and tomato) Very authentic New York wood fire brick oven pizza. Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We dropped in on a Sunday evening. The staff is heckin friendly and the boss obviously cares about everything being just right. The pizza isn't quite ready in exactly three minutes but it's fast enough, and all the ingredients are super fresh. The prices are fair and notably the arugula salad keeps really well for lunch the next day. Definitely try this place when you're done with the bars on West 25th."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza shops in downtown with a great location. The service is super friendly and the food is delicious. Definitely worth a stop in if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Everything was ok until the staff EXCEPT THE PIZZA MAKER started treating me like I was gonna rob the place. If this is your companies example of great or good customer service you really have some work to do. If I EVER come back here again it certainly will be while the little brown haired girl who worked the night of October 29th is NOT there. THANK FOR A BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS! YOU NEED TO STOP IN HERE THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN OHIO CITY! The pizza is made in 3 minutes and it is soooooooooo delicious! Everyone who was working were so nice, helpful, and appreciative. Not only that but the owner is so kind! It was 68 degrees outside at 1:30 am when my fiancé and I stopped in. We wanted to sit outside and eat our pizza, since they opened so recently they didn't have any outside tables or chairs. The owner was so nice he brought out chairs and made us a table so we didn't have to eat on the ground. Best experience I've had at ANY establishment  in a very long time! I will be in again very soon!   P.S- it's 3 shops down from Ohio City Burrito and open late, perfect walk from any of the bars on w25th and they are open LATE. Get here!!!!"}
{"text":"Located at the North end of the W.25th Strip is a small storefront that houses Pizza Whirl and it is well worth seeking out for some very good pizza.  Similar in concept to Pizza Fire, the Whirl seems to do the quick fire pizza better.  The decor is simple and modern, just a counter where they assemble the pizza with a revolving high temperature oven.    While there are a number of options I choose to go with the basic which is the pizza and a single topping for $6.95.  Pizzas come in one size only, I went with the spicy tomato sauce, cheese and the roasted peppers.  Once they put your pizza together and it goes in the oven for 3-4 minutes and comes out nicely cooked.  I was very impressed with the crust, including the nicely charred bits, the center is a bit soft, but that is what happens with the Neapolitan style pizza.  The sauce was good, just spicy enough and the cheese was gooey and delicious.  The best part of the pizza were the peppers, a mix of chunks of different color peppers that had been fire charred in the oven, they provided contrasting crisp and soft bits with just enough sweetness.     Overall Pizza Whirl does a very nice job, by not trying to make a perfect uniform product they provide an nicely individual pizza with character.  A bonus is that on Friday and Saturday the shop is open until 3am.  Pizza Whirl provides a quality product at an affordable price, give them a try if you are in the area and want some Za."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new pizza concept. The employees were very friendly, but still figuring out some of the process details. The pizza was okay, but not anything I'd actively decide to get. They are open late Friday and Saturday nights which might work well for the crowd out late. The garlic knots were fine, but again nothing too exciting. The chicken wings, while they looked large, the taste was poor. The sauces were fine, but the quality of the meat was lacking."}
{"text":"New Pizza spot opened on W25th, and being the pizza connoisseur I am, I had to give it a try!  First off I'll say the location of this business is rather good due to it being open late and also having great pizza I think it will do fairly well. There aren't any other places in the immediate area that sell just pizza so after a long night at one of the bars on the street or even downtown in the flats or W6th stopping by to grab a slice or whole pie is a great move.   As for the pizza itself I was pleasantly surprised. Fresh ingredients that you can see and pick yourself and the pizza cooks in about 5-7 minutes. Also the pizzas are fairly priced. I ordered a pizza with pepperoni, banana peppers, fresh mozzarella, and mushrooms and it was very good! I recommend this place if you are nearby. Not the best pizza spot in Cleveland but far from the worst. This place will be added to my pizza locations go to list for the summer."}
{"text":"Good spot for fast-casual pizza. If you like Pizza Fire then you'll like this place, Pizza Whirl's dough is actually better than Pizza Fire's."}
{"text":"My girlfriend ordered from here on Skip the Dishes for Supper Bowl Sunday. I was not a fan. Pizza was too thin, and if there was any sauce on it I could not find or taste it. All I could taste was cheese which was good, but I should be able to at least taste the sauce.  We also ordered wings, both Buffalo and BBQ. I only ate the BBQ and didn't taste the sauce at all. Just no flavor.  Maybe they were overwhelmed with orders for the big game and had a bad night. However based on this experience I won't be ordering again. Domino's is better than this."}
{"text":"Wow. Not only the best value on the W 25th strip, but the made to order pizzas are really tasty! The ingredients are all fresh and each order only takes 3 mins to cook in their roaring and rotating oven. Very cool. It's worth the walk and the staff is super friendly. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big pizza fan, but I really throughly enjoyed this pizza!! The crust was perfect! Stone cooked, so not greasy.  And tasty.  I forget which one of their specialty pizzas I got, but it had a non traditional cream sauce that was delicious with sausage, peppers and I think onions.   Everything was super fresh and it was sooooooo delicious!   My 17 year old got the mushroom specialty pizza which had a nice chopped up blend of shroons on it.  He loved it and devoured the entire thing right there!    Also, we had gotten the Pizza Whirl famous dessert pizza with things on it like Nutella, fresh sliced bananas and strawberries and a bunch of other ingredients.  Omg is all I could say!   I wanted to eat the whole thing myself but I had to share!   So good!   The staff is super friendly.  The ingredients are fresh and way better then other places I've ever been to. And clean, the place is very clean.    Because of the stone oven, it seems to get a bit hot inside, which might be welcoming when the snow starts to fall, but for now, they do have a couple tables outside. It was nice to sit out on the sidewalk and eat and watch the happenings of w.25th.    I can't wait to go back and try other pizzas and for sure get that dessert pizza!!"}
{"text":"Looking for an authentic and delicious pizza you won't forget after leaving?  Definitely found the spot.  I've been to this spot a few times now and never leave disappointed.  Margherita and \"The Professional\" are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Wow. That is the word that comes to mind when eating this pizza. I got the mushroom madness and I created my own. The crust was a great mix between thin and hand tossed. The ingredients were all extremely fresh. The flavors were so upscale. The prices were almost unbelievable. $20 for 2 pizzas?????! What a deal! I wish I lived in Cleveland so I could stop by every night!"}
{"text":"Pizza whirl is a great addition to Ohio city. There aren't many places in the area where I can leave satisfied with well prepared food for under $10. I ordered the margherita pizza with chicken added. The pizza was ready in 5 minutes and was delicious.The service was amazing! It's a family owned and operated shop and everyone working there just seemed to be having a blast. What set Pizza Whirl in stone at a five for me was their customer service. I had a small issue with my pizza that didn't bother me however I still wanted to bring to their attention but they insisted on making it right. Service like that means the world to me. I'd recommend this place any day if the week."}
{"text":"A-MAZING PIZZA! My first time at Pizza Whirl and the whole experience was great. The staff was beyond friendly and the pizza was some of the best I have had in the 216. Great location on W. 25th. The interior has a great flow and is designed beautifully, with a special touch of Cleveland. The owner, Angelo, came out and chatted with us for a bit and he was an extremely nice guy. He grew up in the Ohio City neighborhood and he and his daughters own and operate the pizza shop. It is very refreshing to see families investing in their own neighborhoods and there is nothing better than a finely tuned Ma and Pa business like this. I highly recommend Pizza Whirl! Again, the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great! The service was slow but they were very friendly. I think they were short handed. My only two complaints is it was hotter inside than outside and the build your own pizza that is meant to be anything you want a bunch of the toppings are a dollar extra. It's crazy. So my build your own was limited to certain toppings even though I was paying premium price. But like I said food was good so I'd return just with lower expectations"}
{"text":"I love coming here! No matter what time of day it is it's always pizza time for me! Conveniently opened from 11am to 11pm on Sunday through Thursday and until 3am in Friday's and Saturday's.  There are endless combinations of pizza to chose from which is why I can never get sick of it! Also the wings are amazing and go great with the pizza! If you are out and about I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Oomph. We chose Pizza Whirl based on the Yelp reviews. Now that I'm writing this, I can't believe this is the same place. Granted, we ordered delivery. I hate giving less than stellar reviews and rarely do, but I think you need to visit this place in-person only.  When we opened the box from our delivery, it didn't look appetizing. Our premium pizza looked vastly different than the fresh and colorful photo we saw on their website. Also, it was missing some ingredients, like the fresh basil. We also had cheesy bread. It was flat dough with cheese on it. You could call it a cheese pizza, since it had the same consistency as our pizza. This felt like something out of Arrested Development. (Insert Gob Bluth voice here: \"It's cheesy bread, Michael. Cheesy BREAD.\")   Both of these items were very greasy. Sometimes greasy pizza can be oddly satisfying, but this was the kind of greasiness you feel coming out your pores. To be honest, we didn't even finish what we ordered. If you're barhopping late night on West 25th, this stop will be your favorite late night pizza place...it does fill the gap of late night eats for people seeking in that area. So that's good."}
{"text":"A friend and I were in the area and tried to go to another pizza spot that was closed. We decided to try Pizza Whirl because I was craving pizza. We didn't really know what to expect because of the mixed Yelp reviews.   Two people were working inside. Both of them were very helpful and service was great! The space was clean and we were the only customers there on a slow, very cold Monday.   We shared a mushroom pizza with added prosciutto and it was delicious! We weren't sure it would be enough food but it was perfect. The crust was thin, just the way I like it and held up to the toppings well. The flavors were well balanced. We were really happy we stopped by, especially since my friend lives in the area. She's added this place to her list of good eats."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I needed a quick bite before heading to the Q. We walked in expecting the pizza to be already made, but it wasn't. They make and fire up each item as soon as you place your order. This is great because we love our food fresh!  We ended up getting the \"Pizza Whirl\" and a calzone in less than 10 minutes. The pizza was top-notch. If New York style pizza is your thing, you have to try this spot. From the thin-crust to the assortment of toppings, you could taste the explosion of flavors with each bite. It was pretty much perfect. On the other hand, the calzone was mediocre at best. But the huge portion made up for the missing \"wow\" factor.  Get one of their signature pies and skip the calzone."}
{"text":"My friend bought me a pie yesterday and i was truly impressed. Fresh toppings and cheese was so good reminded me of my travels to the New-York area (Conn, New Jersey ) where in my opinion the best pizza are made. Great choice of toppings (smoked mozzarella Wow). This will be my go to for pizza great sauce also reasonable pricing. I reside across the street. Thank-you!!!"}
{"text":"I love pizza. If there is a so called \"best\" pizza place that I haven't heard of or been too I make it y mission to try it for myself.   However, this build your own pizza blew me away! I got a Buffalo chicken pizza with a ranch sauce as my base. There isn't a thing I would change about it.   Also the pizzas are baked in about two or three minutes. When I was told that I didn't believe it but once I sat down for thirty seconds after I paid I received my pizza.   If I could I would give 10 stars. But 5 stars is good enough!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten this pizza when ordered on Uber Eats so keep that in my mind. Living in Tremont, I'm used to fantastic pizza within walking distance. Pizza Whirl is just simply not very good pizza. It doesn't taste like anything special. I feel like I could buy something similar in the frozen section at Giant Eagle. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Better than Blaze. Crust is firm and crispy. The owner is a good man. Got basil pepperoni and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best gluten free pizza I've ever had! Too bad they're 5 hours from where I live. It's worth the extra $5, although of course I wish it weren't so much. They add plenty of cheese to the pizza, pepperonis have a great flavor to them, and the sauce is well balanced. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Cleveland! My sister even said the gluten free pizza was better than her regular pizza."}
{"text":"I'm a NJ native, so I have really high standards for pizza. Pizza Whirl met and exceeded them! We had the margherita and the crust was thin, crisped to perfection. The staff was so kind and chatted with me about Cleveland. My only complaint was that the margherita could have used a little more cheese. Overall, this place is delicious and worth a trip :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 4. We were the only people there at the time (around 8pm on a Sunday).  We got the Smokin Whirl and Arugula Bianca, and two servings of garlic Parmesan wings. They made the pizza in front of us and I guess the oven really does cook pizza in 3 minutes because it only took us a few minutes to get our pizza and our wings. The pizza was very fresh and delicious, I loved the topping combinations for both pizzas, the crust was more on the thin side (which I like) and the topping to crust ratio was just right. The wings were very flavorful and tender. The manager/owner came out to see how we were doing, if we enjoyed the pizza. Overall, great service and great food! For a good price!"}
{"text":"Been there numerous times pizza made to order for about half as much as the other places the employees are always polite and the and pizza are awesome especially the king."}
{"text":"I must admit, I was a little hesitant about Pizza Whirl.  I had been walking/jogging past this place since it opened, but it just seemed kind of empty, and the sign of the place just wasn't quite as fancy as other places along the street. However, this weekend, we finally decided to try it- and I kind of regret not trying this place sooner!  Sure, it's a smaller place compared to the rest of the w25th restaurants, but they make good pizza, and it seems to be run by a family (and we do enjoy family run restaurants). Also, I noticed a lot of people do takeout for pizza, and it only really takes seconds to eat pizza, so no wonder I had thought it was empty!  They have lots of options for pizza- even gluten-free pizzas- and it's a pretty fast process. As pizza lovers/makers, we were pleasantly surprised at the fact we saw them add cornmeal into the crust of the pizza (mmmmmm), and it came out just right- not too oily, not too flat, just a pretty good solid pizza.  We split a \"Smokin Whirl\" between the two of us (and believe me, it was enough!). It had roasted red pepper cream sauce as well as roasted red/yellow peppers on top, along with mozzarella, basil, and other yummy goodness- and it came out sooo tasty. I absolutely loved the crust as well. Also, I appreciated that it wasn't the greasy type of pizza I had just gotten down the street the other day as well...my face felt normal after I ate it (haha).  Anyways, this is a great pizza spot to check out if you're in the area and don't want to bother with the lines at the other restaurants. Fast, quick, and good quality pizza- can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! The one topping $6.95 is unbeatable, fresh and cooked to order. Feels healthier somehow. One suggestion is they cook the pizza a tad longer or at a higher temp, crust can be slightly soft."}
{"text":"I came in today to try this place out and was not disappointed. I just got a good ole pepperoni pizza which was only $7 and is slightly larger than a personal pizza and could serve as two meals. You can pay slightly more for more toppings or 10 for a speciality. I'll definitely be coming back to try out the other pizzas because they sounded unique and they have a large variety of fresh toppings. All of the people working there were really nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Pizza Whirl after a night of drinking on a recent trip to Cleveland. While hopping around the different bars on W 25th, we decided to grab a bite to eat, and whats better than Pizza?!  (The answer is nothing, btw).  The place was empty, but it was also 1:30 in the morning, and we decided to give it a try. We were greeted by a friendly young lady behind a counter that was filled with fresh toppings. She explained the process and we decided to create our own pizza (pepperoni, bacon, and mushrooms). We had a seat and a short while later, our pizza was brought to us. The bubbly crispy crust and perfectly baked toppings looked and tasted amazing! The pizza was fresh, hot and delicious! The staff was so friendly and willing to get you anything you needed. I was relieved to see a huge group of people go in as we were leaving. This restaurant deserves all the business!  If you are hesitant about going to Pizza Whirl, stop it. Go now!"}
{"text":"Simple and delicious- that's how you sum up this pizza joint. You can either make your own pizza, pizza salad, or just order a specialty pizza- which is what we did. We got the margarita pizza which was yummy. It was thin crust and not heavy on sauce. We also got the arugula salad which was nice. And the parm garlic wings which were (surprisingly) super crispy and yummy. Not overly saucy or mooshy. Deff will come back here."}
