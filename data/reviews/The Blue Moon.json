{"text":"This place did the impossible. It hired girls that are grosser than the girls at baindaids"}
{"text":"This is a really cool gentleman's club, the girls aren't stuck up like most strip clubs. It's very relaxed and excellent service the manager and security treat you like you're a regular or a friend and right when you are paying they give you all the prices at the door for lap dances sodas and introduces you to the girls they think you'll like best. They let you relax and the girls slowly approach you one by one, Ive been to a lot of clubs where the girls attack you and try and take you for all your money but this is more of a local hang out. They also offer private rooms now where it's more hands on. And a hostess that will seat you or let you sit yourself or get you ones and drinks. Overall they're very friendly and the girls are gorgeous and there's a lot to pick from they really stepped it up."}
{"text":"The blues can happen to anyone. If you live along the crippled & forlorn section of Van Buren near the Airport, I take it you're basking under a sizzling kind of blues as the unfeeling desert sun roasts your ass. So a strip joint located conveniently in a dump of a neighborhood would alleviate the blues of the locals (and horny visitors such as myself), right? Unfortunately, no. This joint only adds to the depressing misery. 

Pass through the doors here & be greeted by overwhelming darkness. The only real light that exists comes from the outside as the doors swing back & forth; once closed you're probably going to trip or bump up against something. Cover before 7pm was $10. Using the ATM to get the cash to pay for that was a pain in the unlit cavern environment. 

I headed to the front & sat with a few others. A light skinned black gal was dancing full frontal, totally naked (no booze sold here). She was a child or two passed her prime. Next was a rather plump dark chocolate lady who appeared to awaken a worm or two as she caressed her snake shaped vagina. Ah, a very skinny light skinned black gal followed, tatted up & rather talkative. Finally, an Amazon blonde women took the stage, all 6'5 of her. Earlier, as I had walked in, I noticed her giving a lap dance to a rather obese elderly man wearing suspenders & bifocals & sporting Elvis pork chop sideburns. He seemed to be remembering a love from way back yonder as the Amazon woman pulled on his old, winded tugboat. When she got up to dance later, she chatted a little with us up front. I saw the old timer sitting there, looking at the rest of us with a look of \"that's my woman, dangnabut!\" I knew it was time to bounce before witnessing the rest of this freak show. 

Blue Moon, you gave me the blues but I got drunk later & saw much finer women elsewhere so I can laugh about it all now."}
{"text":"Lets call it like it is...there are no 10 star girls here, but you will find 5's and sometimes 6's.  The girls are friendly, and nice.  A very quite relaxed place to hang out and relax a bit in the company of nice girls."}
