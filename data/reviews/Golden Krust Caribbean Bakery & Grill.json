{"text":"Was given three prices for The ox tail combination additionally they did not have any fountain drinks or ice had to pay an extra dollar for a canna Coke in addition to the meal that should have included a drink, according to the menu"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! I have been coming to this Caribbean Restaurant since moving to Charlotte 6 years ago. I must admit there was a decline in the food quality about a year ago due to a change in chefs. I did stop coming during that time. I stopped in about a week ago to give it another try. I spoke to the owner and the pleasant staff and found out they have a new chef which they gave rave reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that the were indeed correct. I food was scrumptious  just as I remembered!! Keep up the good work!! I'll be back and I'm putting the word out."}
{"text":"Food is just okay.. Their portion sizes for the amount you are paying is terrible.. You get more Styrofoam than food and I don't like paying $10 FOR Styrofoam. They need to give you a better value. If you are going to cut portions on the meats at least put a good portion of rice so you feel like you got something..  The ones in NEWYork are much better. imho"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Jamaican food and was excited to see a Golden Krust in Charlotte.  The food was average and I didn't get to try the items I really wanted or any patties. I came in at 11:15 and they told me that most of the menu wouldn't be out til noon.    I may come back to try the patties."}
{"text":"I am so glad that they got one of these stores here in Charlotte North Carolina I have been trying to find it I found you found Golden Krust Bakery you must eat their the best you're making pulled ever wish they had more big location that is just a little too far for me to get but I get there when I can try it you will love it Golden Krust the best ever"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, if you are in the mood for Jamaican food this restaurant is great. The sell cakes and patties which are very good. They get a four star because their portions could be better for the price."}
{"text":"FOOD IS GREAT.  The service is average.  The prices are cheap so you tend to get idiots in there who have no manners.  I recommend, taking the food to go or sitting in the back."}
{"text":"It was ok.. my beef patties were like warm and I just felt like for $19.00 my oxtails should have been more than 4 geesh! I probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"This place is NOT Caribbean food! It's terrible. You must ask for a drink separate from the combo even though you've ordered a combo. They're not going to offer it to you either. The food tastes horrible. I wish I could sit outside and turn people around to save their souls. But unfortunately this is all I can do. Take heed and go elsewhere!!!!!"}
{"text":"This food was not my favorite I spent about $12 and barely ate any of it. I went on my lunch and was driving and eating very disappointed. I may try this place one more time in hopes of better flavor."}
{"text":"This was my second time going and my last time!!!! I ordered brown stew chicken and it was so dry and rubbery!!! Basically the chicken was old. Was not cooked fresh today!!! I know I ordered a lunch plate but can I get a full piece of chicken! Not sure why you chop the chicken! Never Ever again I will wait until I go to Atlanta to get really good Golden Krust"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and always received pretty decent service. The food is always tasty and never really found that service was an issue until my last visit. I had a Jamaican visitor and she want hard dough bread to go with our dinner. Now I could have gone a couple of different places but I chose the Bakery. I love this bread but I typically only eat it when in NY, Jamaica or Florida because I need my hard dough to be as fresh as possible.  While the seemingly nice woman was ringing me up I politely asked \"how old is the bread?\" Now I know this is called a bakery but everyone knows their baked goods are shipped in. She responds by saying \"the bread is fresh.\" I say your idea of fresh and mine maybe 2 different things. She became a maniac but in a calm way. She asks: do you want the bread or not? At the time I really just needed to get the bread and leave, dinner was waiting. But not before I explained that as a consumer and patron of this store I have a right to know how old something is in a darn bakery that doesn't bake anything.   After the fact, i was very upset because I could have gone somewhere else, and for her think that it was OK to respond in that manner bothered me. Why was she so combative in the first place? In the end, she told me their shipments come every Tuesday. So this would be the best day to visit if you need baked goods. I myself, will never spend another nickel there."}
{"text":"Golden Krust is decent Caribbean for fairly cheap prices.  If you don't have high expectations for service or want to be \"wowed\" with food, you won't be too disappointed.  On both occasions, I've had the dinner combo ($8-$10).  The food itself is pretty good.  I had the Jerk Chicken and the Curry Goat, both of which were not too spicy. The plates are served with generous helpings of rice and red beans and another side, usually steamed cabbage or collards.  The meat portions was kinda slim.  But the service?  A total take-a-number-and-wait-for-me-to-move attitude pervades this place.  The line was long and the staff were slow to move.  Geez!  My buddy and I sat in the back dining hall, which they closed off with a wet floor sign as they were closing in an hour.  RUDE!  I had to walk around it to get a drink refill.  If you want cheap Caribbean food for takeout, this might be a OK place.  I'm sure that there is a Caribbean joint with more personable service and exceptional food."}
{"text":"Golden Krust is a bakery first and their specialty is the patty, and other baked goods, they also serve Jamaican staples such as oxtails, fish, jerk chicken, and curry chicken with all the fixins(rice and peas, plantains, and veggies), Ting, and other Jamaican drinks. With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive!  Now, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust......."}
{"text":"Much better! I frequent the Charlotte area for work. I previously tried the Golden Crust and honestly I was not impressed. I just went  back this past Saturday not for any cooked food but for prepackaged goods. I shared my dissatisfaction with the manager and she shared things have changed for the better.  A new cook has been hired and she offered samples of oxtail which was tender, well-seasoned and delicious. She also shared a hot flaky fried dumpling, YUM! I'm pleased that the management and cook has changed they are now representing Caribbean food well."}
{"text":"The quantity and quality of the door is great. I had the Curry chicken during lunch on a Friday. Came with more food that I could eat in single sitting. Food has good spice flavour.   On the door there is an advertising for lunch specials $5.99. I commented that I would like the lunch special. It was fixed, and rung up as $12.07. I found out after it was fixed that lunch specials are Mon thru Thursday. The regular prices are not posted.   This place is expensive! Needs to be changed to $$ or $$$!  Also noticed on the way out that group of people, not of my race... We're paying different prices for the same food.   Originally I have it 3 stars, because the food was tasty. But upon exiting the restaurant it dropped to 1 star.  Regretfully, I will not return.j"}
{"text":"Love this place for spicy patties! The patties are worthy of 6 stars, the only reason I gave the 4 stars is because every time I visit the music is blaring and the air conditioning seems to be turned off or not working. They have a dining area, but I can't imagine eating here. And be prepared for a wait, if you have been to the Islands then you know the slower pace you have to get used to.   I have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite. And if you're looking for a cold bottle of Ting or a piece of rock cake, this is your place. Did I mention the spicy patties? Wow, they are delicious. Growing up in Miami, we had a favorite place to go for patties. Here in Charlotte, this is our favorite place. I usually pick up 6, and I'm sure they would hold up fine for a couple of days in the fridge. They never last that long."}
{"text":"The jerk sauce tastes like bbq sauce from a bottle mixed with ketchup! I should've known to keep walking when I didn't see any customers. Never again."}
{"text":"Ive been going here for yrs ...as a NYer I'm familiar with the chain. The foods good but I'm never going back. They've lost me and numerous family members. I wonder if they changed management or something because their portion sizing are horrendous! Theyve scaled back so much and still charge the same thing! I'm not paying for Styrofoam! Then if you ask for more rice you get told \"no!\"  What kind of service is that?! I got a whole lot of gravy though! Ugh theyre rude too! Now the food Id rate a 4...maybe 3.5. But the service and portions a 1. Shame I stopped getting plates and stuck to beef patties but then they stopped serving cheese beef and never bothered to have them again or remove it from the menu. Ill be going to the other Caribbean restaurant up the street from now on."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've been to Golden Krust and I remembered this place being pretty good but things have sadly changed. Walking into the restaurant it was extremely humid and hot so I assume the air condition was not working. My family and I proceeded to order since we were starving. We ordered the Curry chicken with rice and beans and cabbage, Oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage and Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage. We also added 2 spicy beef pattys, they did not have any more regular beef pattys, I was disappointed. With it being so hot in the restaurant I wanted a Large ice water BUT their fountain drink machine was not working and they did not have any bottle waters. The only drinks that were available were bottled juices that I was not interested in. So I walked over to Shane's to buy a large drink. After returning with my large drink in hand my family and I ate dinner. The curry chicken was my favorite out of all the entrees we ordered but I was disappointed in my plantains were very soggy and not fried long enough. The oxtails disappointed me the most. They were not seasoned and did not really have a taste. Overall my experience here was just ok, I hope Golden Krust improves the obvious issues and bring back the original Golden Krust."}
{"text":"We use to like this place but the for the last few times I have gone the food was horrible. We had the jerk chicken and the chicken was beyond dry. I actually think the chicken was left overs from a few days ago. The sauce tasted like barbecue sauce with hot sauce in it and the mac and cheese was very bland. They are always running out of things, today they ran out of plantains."}
{"text":"Food is good, price is good I can't take that away from them to be fair. However I ordered a combo that included a drink and Jamaican bread(forgive my ignorance). I paid with my debit card then when I got my food that's when the woman informed me their drink machine was down, and they were out of the Jamaican bread. Which she then immediately followed up with \" no refunds\"."}
{"text":"Golden Krust really does live up to the name. I ordered Jerk Chicken with a shrimp Jamaican patty. The Jamaican patty had such a crispy, well put together crust. It was probably the best Jamaican patty I've ever had. If you're in the Charlotte area & you like Caribbean food, it's definitely a spot to look into."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, don't go to this place expecting warm and cheery service. Just focus on the food to keep your satisfaction levels in check.  I met some friends here after work based on their recommendation. When we got there, it was empty (this was around 5:30 on a Monday evening) but definitely picked up as time passed.  This was my first time eating Jamaican food (I know!) and I wasn't all that hungry so I hemmed and hawed over the menu for a little bit. I went with the spicy chicken Jamaican patty and a pineapple-flavored Jamaican soda. There's a case of bottled Jamaican sodas or cans of American sodas (coca-cola, pepsi, or mountain dew). FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat.  I went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken. The chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful. It's definitely some I would order on my next visit. Also, the coco bread was/is a winner.  Overall, a good spot to get your introduction to Jamaican food and/or to indulge your already long-held affection."}
{"text":"Love the veggie patties, when they are available...haven't really eaten anything else there."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would !!! I loved the food and the service was VERY FAST ! I loved everything and the small plate filled me up I couldn't even finish. The prices are GREAT and it's seasoned so amazing! I felt like I was on the islands. I would go back and take everyone in my family if I could I will definitely be returning my next trip to North Carolina. I loved it !"}
{"text":"Prepare to be flexible because a lot of things run out.  The food is ok but I tried it because of the lunch specials. I wanted Mac and cheese they'd ran out. Ok, sucked that up because I prob didn't need it anyway. The vegetables and rice to me was very bland. The staff is not friendly and customer service is poor.  Don't come here with a lot of expectations."}
{"text":"I've been going to Golden Krust since the franchise came to Charlotte. Food is always great. The prices are reasonable. Service is just OK. On busy nights like Friday and Saturday they have run out of certain items.  I don't know how authentic the food is but it is on par with other Caribbean spots in town. Over all, I do recommend Gold Krust to get your Caribbean fix."}
{"text":"Pretty good Caribbean Food, Nice location, and decent service. They use to be a lot better years ago. It's a little overpriced for the portions you get, but overall it's ok and I'll probably return"}
{"text":"I was SO excited to see Golden Krust outside NY so I had to stop in while in the shopping center.  My curry goat was SO delicious and had all the right flavor and spice.  The flavors reminded me of the great food I used to get when I lived near a Jamaican area in Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"Amazing! When I want my island meal without having to mess my kitchen this is my place to go.."}
{"text":"Bland food. I don't even know how you can make jerk chicken bland but they managed. The customer service is mediocre. I just recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"What I had was good .. jerk chicken combo with rice and cabbage and gravy on top , and a patty .. very tasty, will stop back 3.6 to 4"}
{"text":"I was craving some homemade oxtails and they delivered! This was my first time visiting here and didn't know if we had a Caribbean spot in the area. The owner was very nice and helpful with my order! I suggest you visit them"}
{"text":"Tis De Place Mon!  First Off me Being from one of the best cities in the world. NYC i know good west indian food and this hit the nail on the head! Great to the point service, with hardy plates not for the quickly filled stomachs here! Try the cuury goat! and the beef patties!! and a DG Soda!   best in carribean food in charlotte, nc! This is truly the mirror image of true carribeen food! anything else is just a watered down xerox copy.  then even have the spice bread and pastries!  Best for lunch $5-6, and dinner $8-10."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars or more, I DEFINITELY WOULD! I always recommend this place to everyone. Outside of the place doesn't due justice to what deliciousness is served inside!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot for some of your Caribbean needs.  You should definitely check it out at least once if you find yourself in the University Area.  It's small and tucked away in the shopping center, but you visibly see the sign for the place.  The menu isn't that big, so you for sure will not be overwhelmed with too many choices.  I have gone here twice now and definitely recommend the Goat Curry or the Oxtail meal.  I don't know about you, but when I ordered these, I also asked for extra gravy.  It was great to have the extra gravy with the rice and cabbage. Note that when you order the meal, it doesn't come with a drink though.  Kinda a bummer on that part.   The place is alright, pretty small.  They have tables near the register, and also near the back.  I haven't been towards the back to see how many tables there are as I have only gotten take out.  The prices are a little pricey to me, but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be going back to a chain for authentic Caribbean food but here we are. In Brooklyn, Golden Crust is probably a last resort for Jamaican cuisine, but it seems that here in the Queen City it's the only place to get some decent stew, curry, and jerk. The patties are excellent too! Also try the bakery items like the sweet potato bread, they're always fresh.  The service is good enough too, I can't complain at all about this place. After a few months here, I thought I would be cooking all Caribbean food myself but Golden Crust has saved me the trouble.   Will be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"The roti here is an improvement on the other Jamaican restaurants I've eaten at in Charlotte. I'm from Brooklyn, so I'm used to having maximum food for a great price. Not so in Charlotte, for the minimal amount of oxtail, the price could be a bit lower. There is no reason to pay a high price for lots of rice and cabbage but a scoop of oxtail.   I'm definitely not expecting oxtails to dominate the plate, but the serving my daughter had was enough to convince me I won't be getting anything other than beef patties here. That is, when they actually have any available."}
