{"text":"This bakery has it all. Warm and friendly staff, delicious food, great desserts, and coffee. This place is a diamond in the rough, not to be missed."}
{"text":"I ordered cannoli's and a cream roll pastry and I regret it big time! Though it looked good on display, it wasn't fresh at all! The shell was damp and had a stale taste. The lady who was helping me was not polite either. She was very abrupt. Not sure if she was intentionally trying to be rude or that's just how she is... Either way, I wasn't impressed with the food or the service and will not be going back again!"}
{"text":"We ate the veal, meatball, and focaccia sandwiches which were delicious. You can add any of the toppings they have to the sandwiches (except for focaccia) for an extra fee and though they are simple, the sandwiches taste great. We also ate the stuffed peppers and the arancini which aren't great full meal foods but they were good anyways. The pasta was good and the pizza was ok, but they didn't ask if we wanted it for here or to go so we got it cold. They also have delicious desserts and freshly baked breads. Overall, a real home-style Italian bakery that it worth trying."}
{"text":"The eggplant is great but it always finishes early so get there quick. The veal and chicken on a bun are both excellent however the toppings are quite expensive so try to limit yourself to one or two. All the pasta is really great but if I had to choose I'd pick the lasagna with rapini on the side, second choice would be the tortellini with mushrooms on the side. Definitely a neighborhood staple."}
{"text":"One of my fave hot tables hidden in scarbz, pasta and sandwiches are a must with their hot peppers.

There's always a crazy line up at lunch (so plan to be in line for 20-30 minutes) and if you plan on beating the lunch rush after 2pm then you might not get what you're going in for.

I've got 15 years of Veal sandwiches, Meatball sandwiches and Lasagna in my belly, I just wish I was a fatty so I can cram more into my pie hole."}

The good was both delicious and plentiful"}
{"text":"If you love homemade Italian food, you will love this place. The hot table always has a good selection of pasta, usually gnocchi, lasagna or tortellini. I love the veal or meatball sandwiches.  They are big enough to share.  It is very, very casual dining.  You can eat in or take out. I great place to go if you are craving Italian food at a reasonable price."}

There desserts are like a fine art, every little pastry made and designed with care by hand .  Keep up the great work and thank you for making Agincourt Bakery's one of the best"}
{"text":"awesome locally owned shop for a delicious lunch that is affordable feels very 'homemade'. My go to favourites are the veal sandwich and lasagna. I'll mention that although the veal sandwich is only $5, they do charge extra for most of their toppings that other places may not charge for. However, the portions are huge, and even with a few toppings, your sandwich will still be reasonably priced.

The lasagna is very simple - and has very little spice or seasoning, which some people may not enjoy but that is my favourite thing about it. 

The place is also a mini supermarket, with lots of canned/shelf products, fresh bread, salad bar, and a huge bakery section with tons of Italian desserts."}
{"text":"I was so hungry and in such a rush when I went here for lunch the other day, that I forgot to take a picture of my sandwich. I'll have to go back soon and rectify that, because it was certainly picture worthy!
The Agincourt Bakery has been a semi-regular drop in for me for more than a decade. They basically have a smaller restaurant inside a bakery, and although their food selection is somewhat limited, there are still many items to choose from. I've yet to have anything I didn't like here. Service is cafeteria style hot table, and everything is laid out where you can see it, so you know exactly what you're getting. The staff that serves are friendly and efficient, and make every effort to make your order exactly what you were hoping for. 
Last time in I had the chicken sandwich. And as usual I wasn't disappointed. Two nice sized white meat cutlets breaded and lightly shallow fried, dipped in their tomato sauce (you can leave off the sauce if you like, although I'm not sure why you would!), and put on a nice sized bakery bun. I added mushrooms for $1, and so my sandwich ended up being $7 - a bargain in my eyes. 
There are a number of other sandwich options, lasagna, pizzas, chicken and veggies, and a few other things on the menu to choose from. And they're all reasonably priced as well 
The place is pretty busy at lunch time, but with both indoor and outdoor seating, there is usually somewhere to sit if you choose to do so. 
The only slight drawback about the place is that the cashout process can sometimes be a little slow. The food servers give you a bill with your food, which you then line up at the cash register to pay. Since the store is also a bakery, and there are often people buying baked goods (and some of these items need to be weighed), there can get to be a bit of a backup as all are funneled to the same single cash register. 
A minor inconvenience though, and certainly not one that will stop me from going back here again and again."}
{"text":"Shari M. pretty much sums it up.  I can add;

They have what should be a staple of all Italian bakeries but isnt - a great eggplant sandwich too.  They'll also throw together a \"plate\"...whatever you want.  \"I'll have a few slices of breaded eggplant...a bit of broccoli...some of those potatoes...oh, and can you throw on some mushrooms and tomato sauce?\"  Whatever you want.

Oh, and since they expanded and added seating a couple of years ago, you don't have to take out or sit outside on plastic furniture.

A great, family place."}
{"text":"I was very excited to have found a great little bakery in Scarborough (other than Francesca bakery I didn't know any others).

It's a little hard to find as this bakery is tucked away on the corner of a little known plaza.  The fogged up windows weren't helping the bakery's outer appeal either.  

Upon entrance you actually are welcomed by a beautiful array of baked sweets and with further exploration you see specialty Italian foods including cheese,  olives and prepared hot foods. 

I got the pistachio, Nutella,  and original cannoli as well as the pecan butter tart (all $2 each). The young lady helping us was very nice and was kind to explain some of the less familiar Italian desserts to us. 

The pistachio cannoli had a chocolate covered shell  (it actually made it really hard to bite into) no obvious pistachio flavor.  Nutella one was okay, tasted of Nutella but lost the nice ricotta flavor and texture.  Original was good but I much prefer the one from Francesca Bakery.  Pecan butter tart was good but wayyyy too much pastry shell rather than filling."}
{"text":"I ordered only simple soup(no special ingredient inside),few broccolis(which are overlooked), one thin slice of chicken(decent),they cost me almost $15..... I think they are way too expensive in fast food style"}
{"text":"I love this place. The eggplant lasagna and the pistachio cannoli are some of the greatest things I've had the pleasure to taste in my life. I kid you not. You have to try them out.

I used to be a frequent at raymerville deli bakery up in Markham. Unfortunately they closed down about a month ago and I had to find a replacement. Through the recommendation of a friend, I found agincourt bakery and have been going there ever since. I have no complaints. The food is always delicious no matter what I order. I might feel experimental and want to try something new, and never have I been disappointed. I'm always finding new favorites. The service is fairly quick and I never had to wait too long. They also have a decently sized seating area inside and outside (depending on weather) so you have a place to enjoy your food right away.

Go check this place out. I don't write many reviews. The fact that I wrote one for this place is a testament to how much I want you guys to experience this."}
{"text":"Since this place is close to where i live and it showed good yelp ratings i figured i would give it a try.  Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. 
Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a family member and I will forever be indebted to them. Fresh, fresh and fresh. The bakery part is amazing, the deli meats are fresh and reasonably priced the hot bar and cold bar are wonderfully clean and well maintained. The staff are so sweet, my son wanted the pasta but was worried it was too spicy so the lady behind the counter let him try it. The tomato sauce is so tangy. I haven't yet tried there sandwiches but they are next on my list. The pizza is excellent as well. It is a little tricky to find in a very small strip mall but take the time to find it, it's a little gem!"}
{"text":"Great for Italian takeout and you can  dine  in as well.  I have tried most of their hot  table items and haven't had one bad dish.  Their sandwiches are great, bread is fresh. Desserts are awesome as they pretty much every pastry and cookie you can imagine!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Agincourt Bakery for lunch.  They have a great variety at their hot table.  The price is reasonable, and you get a large portion.

I would also rate their breads and rolls very high.   

The downside is their pastry offerings.  They look very inviting and delicious until you actually have a bite.   I picked up some buttertarts to bring to a friend, and they'd picked up the taste of everything on the hot table!  I was embarrassed...  Tasted like something I'd had in my fridge for weeks.

So if you want a nice, affordable lunch, try Agincourt Bakery.  If it's pastry you're after, beware."}
{"text":"Nice Italian bakery with hot table. Very pleasant staff, great for a casual lunch or take out..."}
{"text":"Qualifying criteria for a good Italian bakery/deli/caterer: 
- you walk in and the owner knows customers names and vice versa: CHECK 
- have been in business for years: CHECK 
- make a llaarrggee veal sandwich that guarantees you will wear some of it: CHECK 
- portion sizes are large, and hearty, enough that a collection of construction workers and other men in uniform are lining up for food: CHECK 
- an older Italian couple is talking over espresso: CHECK 

All in all, the signs are there. 

One of the best lasagnas I have ever had. Something like 7 layers of delish. This warrants a 5 star rating. 

What does not warrant a 5 star rating: their veal. The veal is chewy, not tender like butter. The sauce is not flavourful enough. Not something you would expect from an Italian bakery. 

If you want lasagna, bread, fresh pasta - go to Agincourt Bakery. If you want veal on a bun - go to California Sandwiches."}
{"text":"This cute little Italian bakery is everything you need in your life! I found it through recommendation and am definitely gonna go again to try out their other products.

 I went at about 5pm and it was super empty. The staff was nice, knew I was craving sugar and gave me some great recommendations. Next time I'm gonna try one of their brownies or tarts, they looked mouth watering.

I got three canollis, the Nutella, vanilla and chocolate. All of them tasted delicious. Not super sweet and yet really creamy. The shell was super soft as well and easy to bite on to. The powdered sugar on top was the only annoying part, it toppled a bit over and made a bit of a mess. The different flavours don't make that much of a difference I found, they were pretty faint. But it was still overall yummy.

The prices are not terrible as well. The cannolllis were 2$ each, and every other dessert was about 2-5$, pretty standard bakery prices. 

Also heads up, this is more of a grab and go bakery. Didn't see any seating area."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for the past few years. They have the best Italian sandwiches - veal, chicken, sausage, but the meatball is to DIE for....must try!"}
{"text":"My staple here is the veal sandwich.
Starts off at $6 for just the veal & bread. Extra toppings cost $1-1.50 per item. Well worth it, in my opinion, as the toppings are quite generous (see pictures below). Finishing one can be challenging!

Service here is always friendly."}

Always busy as well but this is good to see. 
I always bring friends in when possible and when I am in the area.
Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't think this place is necessary cheap but I love the flavors in their pasta salads and lasagna. Their desserts are great too! Nice selection on the desserts. It's hard to find an Italian bakery in this area so it's my go - to!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name Agincourt Bakery fool you, it's an Italian bakery that sells bread, desserts and Italian food. Some might assume it's a Chinese bakery b/c the establishment doesn't have a distinctive Italian name and has Agincourt attached to it which has always had a large Chinese community.

Here is the review.

It's known for having one of the better veal sandwiches in the city ($4.99). Some days the veal is better than others ( more tender) but nonetheless it's still pretty good. The chicken parmesan sandwich is always really good ($5.99). Just remember to ask them to go easy on the sauce or it's makes eating the sandwich really messy.

You can also opt to go for a plate which includes pasta and bread ($9.99) which is also nicely done. The portions are also very generous. Just one thing to keep in mind is that if you want hot peppers or mushrooms and other added items, it will set you back a dollar for each additional item.

I'm also a big fan of their cannolis which are available in vanilla and chocolate custards from what I remember.

Definitely a hidden gem in Scarborough.

FYI: The rating should be a 3.5 stars."}

Thanks to the owner(s) and employees of Agincourt Bakery.

After viewing these pics. On your visit of Agincourt Bakery for the first time, you will feel a sense of familiarity."}
{"text":"Came here today to get some sandwiches and desserts, as I have been wanting to check this place out for a while.

Came here around 5PM and there were no other customers. As per other reviews this place is busiest during lunch time.

We ordered a meatball sandwich with mushrooms, got 2 sausage rolls, and I got one chocolate cannoli from the desserts section.

The meatball sandwich was huge! Could use a little bit of sauce, but it tastes better than California Sandwiches in my opinion. The meat is tastier. The sandwich is good for 2 people meaning you get a pretty large serving for a small price.

The chocolate cannoli ($2) was good as well. It wasn't too sweet, just perfect.

I would not order the sausage rolls again. It wasn't as fresh and warm. It was just ok. 

Service is very friendly which is what guarantees me coming back.

I think I have found the place to be a regular next. :) I recommend to try their sandwiches! Next time I will try getting just one meatball as the meatballs are really delicious here!

{"text":"Visited this quaint little bakery a week ago for simple but delicious Macaron and ended up leaving with a number of their delectable treats. Everything I tried was amazing and at their prices you definitely can't go wrong. 

Looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"The macaroons suck. They are as hard as rocks. 

The cakes and small desserts from La Rocca (cake brand they order from) are good though. I particularly like caramel crunch.

The tiramisu they make is ok. The display cooling system seems to have made the edges taste more dried, chewy, and odd. I've also noticed that their pistachio raspberry dessert (from La Rocca) looked different from those found at other places. Theirs had a darker and harder than usual rim which is not as good.

The air within the restaurant today made it uncomfortable for me to breathe. I was only there for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Really good Italian meatball ($7) and veal ($6) sandwiches. Both have huge portions of meat.  Toppings are extra ($1-$2 ea) but again the portions are very generous.  Think 'smothered' rather than 'sprinkled'. You get the idea. 

Have yet to try their hot table of assorted pastas but everything looks delicious and homemade. 

They also have a nice section of baked goods as well as some seriously delicious hot sausages. 

Limited seating. Really a grab and go place. Service friendly.

3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Holy Moly Batman! I have been here a few times and I leave feeling like I ate a cow or whole chicken.  The portions are enormous and the extra toppings...enormous but I am at an Italian bakery so it should be expected!

Looks like a family owned place with Nonna making the sandwiches with her daughter and grand daughter.  The service is above and beyond and that makes you want to go back.  As for the food...amazing!

You can get sandwiches, pasta, salads, pizza, dessert, bread, and much more.

It is hidden in a corner at Finch and Pharmacy so it is easy to miss but if you know of it spread the word.

P.S. always a line up at lunch time."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and it feels like it gets better each time. Both times I've had the Chicken sandwich. It's a pretty big sandwich and they make sure you get a big portion of chicken. Be warned though, it can be messy! Prices are decent for the hot table.

The cannoli, Portuguese tarts and butter tarts are all delicious too.

The service is great. Friendly and efficient. There's a line around lunch hour since they're pretty popular, but it moves at a decent pace.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of those bustling bakeries with italian grandma's walking around in aprons preparing your food with precision and care. The Veal sandwich is the crown jewel here, just a perfect balance of ingredients I recommend adding mushrooms and sweet peppers, also provolone cheese is a must if you like cheese. Be aware however, that although the veal sandwich is advertised as only 6 dollars, each topping is an additional $1.00 or $1.50, which made my sandwich come to $11.30 after tax. The portion and taste make it very much worth it. It's a good sign when 90% of the people in that plaza are walking towards the bakery. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I gave this place another chance and was very surprised.  I actually feel bad because I think I just came on a bad day.  Its still in a sketchy area but the food and service were much better this time."}
{"text":"Nice Italian Bakery hidden in the corner of an old shopping plaza on Pharmacy right off Finch. 

Agincourt Bakery is a small family run Italian bakery that offers up Italian desserts, breads, antipasto, and cheeses. But besides that stuff, the real reason I showed up was to take on the Veal Sandwich I heard much about. The meal counter offers up a variety of classics like homemade lasagna, cheese tortellini and homemade meatballs. 

The Veal Sandwich was just alright. I wasn't sure what the big deal was. The sandwich itself is a messy one, so make sure you make good use of the napkins around. The bread is crunch on the outside and was very warm and soft on the inside. The breaded veal cutlets are soaking in the sauce, so the light breading actually becomes way too soggy. Many other places dip the veal in sauce which works much better. The taste was a bit sour, but the meat was tender. The sandwich has to be ordered with cheese (provolone or mozzarella recommended). 

We also got an order of the cheese tortellini to take home because it looked great. The taste was good. The shells were stuffed to the brim and the sauce was rich and creamy. Make sure you eat it while it's hot, because it doesn't get better in the fridge. (We're idiots)

I would come early when everything is freshly made. We arrived a bit later in the afternoon, so many of the items on the hot counter were just sitting around. Besides the hot counters, the bakery and desserts looked incredible. Will probably come back to try some."}
{"text":"It best place to eat at. No one would beat it.

Veal and saugues,lasagna and more you can't beat it.

Dessert are amazing did something new like nutula in cannoli. If you haven't been there you don't know what you missing"}
{"text":"I'm still woozy two hours after having a veal sangwich at Agincourt. Thanks to my friend Trina who took me -- and glad we got there before noon, what a line-up! It is tucked away in a small strip mall and truly you'd miss it if someone didnt show you it was there. 

I had the $4.99 veal sangwich (love saying it that way) with peppers, onions, mushrooms and rapini...what I didn't realize was that every toppting was an extra $1.50 and the rapini might have been more actually. With a carbonated water -- and a gigantic apple struddel for later, we sat down to eat. There's only about 20 seats so as I said, get there early.

Shari's review best describes the joint so I wont re-hash, other than to say that the sangwich (there I go again) is delicious and Trina and I had a tough time talking with our mouth's full.

Truly a hidden gem. I'll be back with my 16 year old son to do some real damage and will certainly try a plate of food next time, or a meatball sangwich (sorry, I love that).

Ciao!"}
{"text":"Agincourt Bakery. Everytime I go in, I leave smelling like I've soaked in a vat of their delicious sauce and fresh bread. No complaints here! 

The hot table / salad bar offer great selection! Pastas, pizzas, and leafy greens and lots of different salads.

The anancini is so good..aw man...are they ever good. THIS IS COMFORT FOOD. sauce it up! 1 ball can easy be a meal - pair it with a leafy salad - damn! 

I've tried 2 types of their sandwiches - the chicken and the meatball. Big portions, and tasty as hell! The meatball sub is insanely huge...but so flavourful and messy - the way a good meatball sub should be! Adding toppings is extra - but you're just adding goodness to an already good thing.  

The service is always great! The staff are always smiling, and so polite - I never leave without a smile on my face even if I'm just picking up a couple of buns for the week. 

Lots of parking - never an issue!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and went in for a meatball sandwich. The sandwich was huge and the mushrooms and meatballs generously sized. The bun was fresh and the total cost was $9, which is pretty pricey for one sandwich. I couldn't wait to dig in -- and when I did, I was pretty disappointed at the bland taste. This meatball sandwich was a 2 on a scale of 10. I planned to come back to try the chicken and veal sandwiches if the meatball one was a winner -- but I'd rather get the chicken and veal at Primo Foods where the sandwiches are amazing because of the fresh, awesome sauce and the fresh condiments. I also considered getting some pastries here but they all looked like they were made weeks ago -- not worth the spend. It just seemed like everything in the store had been around for days or weeks -- except the breads and buns. To be fair, for my money, this place isn't worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch... I recommend staying away from the pasta but , get veal or chicken sandwiches or plates instead... 

-veal without bun, ( or chicken) add eggplant and do not dip the eggplant in sauce. Ask for hot sauce ( which is the juice from the hot peppers) , and as well, sweet peppers and as many hot peppers as you like...

For dessert.... Eclair!!! Best ever (I don't generally like eclairs but this place makes the good)"}
{"text":"Had the veal sandwich, and added $1 for mushrooms.

The taste was good, but nothing special. The mushrooms were canned mushrooms, so I was not impressed. I guess it would taste better if it was eaten right away. I had to deliver them to the mister that was 10 mins away, by that time, it was very soggy. I wonder if they have an option to toast the bread? 

I also got 6 french macarons on my way out. 3/6 of them were STALE. The nice lady gave me 3 from the display and 3 from boxes that were just delivered. I was obviously NOT impressed with the stale ones. Given the prices, I was disappointed especially with all the great reviews.

+1 for ample parking and easy to find location."}
{"text":"Have been working in north-east Scarborough since September and have only recently discovered this gem. Dropped in on a Tuesday at around noon (consider yourself warned as it gets quite busy!). There's a hot food area where you can order a number of Italian favourites from pastas to arancini balls to veal sandwiches. The team here is pretty efficient so your wait time isn't too long. You can get your food to go or sit in Agincourt's dining area. 

Good for: lunch, Italian food"}
{"text":"Love this little Italian bakery that sells delicious homemade Italian food! They sell veal and chicken parmesan sandwiches, homemade beef lasagna, arancinis, cannolis, and more! The prices are decent, about $6 per sandwich (and they're pretty huge) without extra toppings. Arancinis are about $3 each.  The arancinis are large and filled with vegetables and meat. There are lots of desserts in addition to different flavoured cannolis.

Beware for those who want to get a \"quick\" lunch from here--it gets quite busy and the line up can be quite long during the lunch hour. I came here on a Friday at 12:30pm and there were at least 15 people in line ordering food.  I luckily was able to ask for two arancinis and paid for them quickly at the cash.  Unfortunately, arancinis tend to sell out before the end of the day, so make sure you give yourself enough time!"}

{"text":"Location/service:
I am a fan of this awesome Italian bakery! I am a huge fan of veal sandwiches and when my friend brought me here one day, it has become my favourite restaurant to get my veal sandwich fix. The bakery is in the corner of a plaza so it might hard to find it. There is a lot of parking spaces there and people seem to come in and out of the private parking lot. I went in on a busy lunch hour on a weekday at 11:45am and the place was filled with people getting lunch. Not to worry though, there are 3 women behind the counters working so the line moves fast! Once you get your food, you proceed to the cashier line, pay and go. Or, you can go to the back of the bakery and sit down to eat your meal. 

In addition to the awesome service,  I left my phone in the washroom on my first visit. When I called back after realizing I've lost it 30 minutes later, the staff there was willing to help me locate it and put it safely behind the counters. I returned after work and was able to get it no problem. Thank you to the people working there!!! You guys rock!

Food:
There were quite a few choices for lunch that day. They had the tortellini and many other tomato sauce based pastas which all of them looked delicious but I didn't get them because I really wanted to try their veal sandwich! They gave me extra sauce and Parmesan cheese. You are free to add more toppings if you want for an extra price. The veal sandwich is hands down the best that I've ever had! The meat is super tender and the sauce is just perfect for my liking - not too salty, not too sour. I also got the arachini balls and they were good as well :) On another occasion, I visited the bakery after work at around 5:30pm and alot of the food was sold out. There was one piece of veal left and the lady at the counter gave me a discount for it. I'm guessing this place is best for lunch. 

If you are ever in the area, please visit this awesome bakery and get the veal sandwich! They also offer the eggplant parmesan sandwich if you are vegetarian! The bakery also sells pre-packaged lasagna and italian desserts (e.g. cookies, cakes). A coworker bought an assortment of them one time and I tried a couple. Unfortunately, they weren't as good and a little pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice portions. Great prices. And great pastries too. Usually get the veal or lasagna. But everything is good."}
{"text":"I just noticed that just about every place I review I give a 4.
I guess I should not that I'm not overly picky.
Nor am I a Mr. Fancy Pants...... I like good food at good prices.
I think you always have to factor in the price paid when giving an honest review.

With that said Againcort Bakery is a place I've been turned onto by a co-worker.
I've got 3 times now and each time I go I get the \"V3.\"
The veal sandwich with peppers (sweet or hot) and onions, topped with a sprinkle of parmasian cheese. 

Combo this with a bottle of pop and my meal comes in at just shy of $10.

The veal is hot, sloppy, and tasty.  You leave satisfied!
Perhaps not as good as California Sandwiches, but a good place none the less."}
{"text":"I can't begin to describe. The cheese tortellini is to die for. Add chicken, they give you two pieces! The meatball sub is amazing too!

So good there's always a line, but it goes quick. The desserts look too good to be true too."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in the corner of the plaza just north of Pharmacy and Finch. Behind the condo. 

Amazing lunch items. From the huge meatballs to the veal sandwiches, you just can't go wrong. Just be prepared for a mess and get a lot of napkins. There is no way to eat the sandwiches without stuff spilling out. Delightfully messy. 

The only reason why I don't give this place 5 star is that the dessert seem to be lacking. They have a large selection but they all taste a bit stale. Also there never seems to be enough seating."}
{"text":"this place isn't perfect but it's pretty damn good.

i used to work close by so i would often drive over for lunch.

most of the time, i'll order the double roasted chicken leg, potato, and broccoli which is $8 +taxes. great bang for the buck.

i've also had cheese tortellini which is what you'd expect, but the lasagna here is very good too, and filling. Rice balls were alright, very filling. I've had the smarties cookies at the front before and i was expecting a more delicious cookie but maybe its because i prefer my cookies soft and chewy. the strudels here are very good as well.

it's quite out of the way for me to get there now, but i do miss that roast chicken dinner."}
{"text":"Having passed by this plaza on a regular basis for a few years, I had no idea there was something in it that sold food, let alone good food, so imagine my surprise when my friend said, let's go eat at that plaza by huntingwood and pharmacy. \"EINH?!\" was my response...\"do you mean bridlewood mall?\" 

I was still in a disbelief when the plaza came into view - there's no restaurants in there! Except I was wrong. Duh. The bakery is tucked into a tiny tiny corner and virtually unseeable to the naked eye of a muggle without special food searching prowess (well in summer they have outdoor so that helps a bit more, but otherwise, you could easily not realize it's there).

So now the question is, why only 3 star and not 4, given my elaborate description of the restaurant shop and the simple fact I said the food is good? Well convenient travels from my personal location doesn't really account for a star bump right? If you happen to be in the neighbourhood and looking for somewhere to eat without having to go all the way down to Sheppard or up to Steeles, then this place is the bomb. Sandwiches, salad, and pasta freshly made with friendly service and decent price point: $5 for a plain veal sandwich, $1 extra for mushrooms, $1.50 for cheese, $0.50 for cooked onions (they dont have raw), $2 for eggplants, etc. Basically every topping you add will cost you extra. 

But would I make a special trip out there just to eat the sandwich if I have a car and am not too lazy to use it? Not really. It's good food, just not good enough to travel far for. 1 proletariat michelin star."}
{"text":"They may have cookies that are harder than a rock or a Volvo, but their Veal Sandwiches are simply yummy. The peppers give the sandwich a nice body and texture and tastes just wonderful. The veal has a nice chewy texture and a delicious sauce."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot I visit regularly. It has fresh bread and pasta dishes made daily and large bakery to boot. Watch out cause this place gets busy during lunch time as a local lunch spot. 

I'd have to say the veal sandwiches are to die for and their chicken dinners are the best value you can find. So tasty and flavourful all their food is great."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, but the pastries look better than they taste.  I've been here 3 times and each time they were not fresh,  the last time the cannoli was so stale I had to spit it out and rinse my mouth.  The pizza is super salty, even the crust is salty.  The sandwiches are good though, simple, fresh and very filling."}
{"text":"Been here more than several times for lunch of the last 6 months.  Genuine taste of Italy but come with an appetite and save room for some of the many pastries they have.  Hot lunch is a great option and the servings are huge.  Any of the sandwiches I've had are hands down some of the best.  I've not tried the pizza so cannot comment."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! Good food awesome service!!! Portions are great!! Eat here quite often with colleagues from the office!!!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended we eat here for lunch for their veal sandwiches. I never tried it before so I got the veal ($6) with additional toppings of mushrooms and mozzarella ($1 each). There's a lot of tomato sauce in the sandwich so be prepared to get messy! The sandwich was good but I thought it should be hotter so the cheese can melt properly. It might be because we missed the lunch rush since there weren't that many people in the store so make sure to come a bit early if you're planning to get hot items. You'll have to order your sandwich/ hot food at the back and pay at the front of the store. The pastries were very enticing, I wanted to try one of those massive cookies or a cannoli! I'll probably get one the next time I come back."}
