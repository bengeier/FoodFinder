{"text":"This joint on the strip was not even decent but it has mediocre food.  I stopped by for a late breakfast and I regret it.    The rice leans towards the congee side, the soup dish was bland, and like previous reviewers say the longganisa was like a hot dog and it tasted weird.  The price was sort of expensive, too.    I dunno why I ended up here maybe I was jonesin' or something.  I should have eaten at the Bally where they had the cheapo prime rib breakfast."}
{"text":"The food here is actually decent, but nothing to gloat about. If im in the area and craving filipino food i'll drop in sometimes. I awayse get there chicken curry and mung bean stew, it alwayse hit the spot!  Ive tried many of there other dishes, some is good and some is bad, but for some reason i alwayse end up ordering the same thing haha. The Service is ok, typical of any asian restaurant haha. The best part about Kapit is probably the parking lolz theres plenty of it. I would love to rate kapit bahay alittle higher but they need to change up there menue alittle more. I remember coming here a few days in a roll and the menue was the same, after awhile you get kinda burned out haha.  Overall, Food is decent, service is ok but parking is great! Haha"}
{"text":"Value for money Filipino food for last than US$10 per person depending on number of dishes with rice.   Food is tasty but a bit salty for me, it is alright when it goes with rice. We had fried fish and tried the chicken adobo. We takeaway some of the Filipino satay which is stick of pork chunks.  The Halo Halo dessert was served in a cup & not in a bowl. It is shaved ice with topping and normally with ice cream. Taste is not bad, but was hard to eat from a straw and there was no ice cream."}
{"text":"The food tasted ok. They didn't give enough food or enough rice; at least not for the price. However the place was clean and the staff was friendly. The taxi driver raved about it but he wasnt a pinoy so not exactly an opinion to take too seriously.   I had the caldereta which was tasty. The pusit was dry; like rubber. I barely touched it. I paid $24 for a group of four. It was ok. Not going back though."}
{"text":"Um.. the food looks like it's been sitting out for quite some time.  Rare gem though, get the coconut water after a fun filled night of drinking because it will clean you out of all your toxins and naughties. =)"}
{"text":"Nice little turo-turo place.  Nothing like a ice cold glass for sago't gulaman in the blazing heat of Las Vegas.  The place was nice and clean.  Reminds of the ones in the Bay Area.  Their kare-kare is yum!  Reminds me of my mom's.    So Kapit Bahay...glad to have you as a neighbor.  Would definately come back for the drinks when I'm around your area."}
{"text":"Servings are on the smaller-side when compared to other pinoy restaurants at this price range. We bought a 2-item combo: 12-ounce pinakbet, 7-cubes of lechon kawali, & 2-scoops of rice. Pinakbet was average. Lechon Kawali was good."}
{"text":"Quick, convenient, and descent tasting food --- probably even among the better ones in Las Vegas valley BUT the customer service is close to none existent!!! A lot of non-Filipino customers come in and ask about the menu and all their employees do is tell them what the food is called and tell them that they taste good. For heaven's sake, these people would like to know how the food was prepared and what are their ingredients!!! To add to that, one lady keeps giving customers food items other than what they ordered because she is so quick to forget.  I will come back here for the food but their customer service is just among the worst!"}
{"text":"The worst tasting filipino food ive ever tasted in my life. Food was cold and wasnt fresh. rice smelled funny. best to say filipino food is better cooked at home. The 2 reasons why it didnt get  1 star is 1. Its on the strip and 2. only pinoy spot.on the strip."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while, at least over 9 years. You have to come here early enough to get the food while it's still fresh, otherwise they're just sitting under the heating lamps all day.   The food here is not the best Filipino food around town, but it is just OK. The bistek (beef steak) is a bit too chewy and a lot of the meat has a lot of fat. I know cooking meats with the fat is what makes the meat nice and juicy, but this is really overboard. You're pretty much just getting an order of the sabao (sauce) and onions with cooked fat!   I used to come here just to get the adobo pusit (squid) since they seem to be the only Filipino fast food place that serves it. But the last time I ordered it, it didn't taste the same. I'm not sure what it was, I think it was the way the sauce tasted. It was more watery than usual or something. Whatever it was, it was enough for me to tell myself not to order it anymore.   They also have some Filipino grocery items in the store. But beware, they are REALLY expensive! A bag of chicharon that costs $1.29 next door at Ranch 99, costs over $3.00 at Kapit Bahay! You'd think it would be a lot lower knowing its more than half the price right next door!   Overall, this place is....ehhhh... okay. I would rather go to another Filipino fast food before going here."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast this morning,  food served was not at proper temperature.  Seems to have been day old food reheated.  The steam rice tasted spoiled.  Would never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Good food.. But the cashier/server doesnt seem so happy. I've been here twice and same attitude.. It would get 4 stars, if they had an attitude change. i was hoping they were just having a bad day the first tym, but I dont think they like what theyre doing. Prolly not gonna come back unless I am dying to have filipino food. And I love filipino food!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best filipino food in town i ever ate. Sisig is very good as well as pansit is perfect taste, I  will definitely recommend this place to my friends to come try and eat."}
{"text":"They look full so I decided to give it a try.  People standing at a Panda Express set up line, order in a foreign language, so it is usually a good sign, that the food is authentic.  But when we order the sweet and sour pork, the lady behind the glass give us All fat pork.  A minute ago, I saw she spooned all lean pork from the same dish to a lady who obviously speak their language.  So that is a big turn-off, I am not coming back again."}
{"text":"I eat here quite often and it is delicious every time! My go-to order: the 2 item combo with a heaping scoop of rice, pancit & chicken adobo. If I'm feeling like I need a little extra, I order the shrimp & veggie lumpia.. they are seriously large and in-charge tho', so make sure u bring an appetite~!  The staff is super friendly and very quick! They also offer some take home goodies like ensaymada, puto, ube cake and more! This place definitely fulfills my Filipino food cravings!"}
{"text":"Pit stop for the mister and I walking along the blvd. We saw the sign filipino fast food. A filipino joint right on the strip! It is located in an open area mini mall full of street vendors & souvenir shops. Curiosity got the best of us and we could use a dessert break. As you enter you will be greeted by shelves of filipino chips and goods followed by a buffet behind the counter. Your choice of a combo of meat and rice. Not a bad place for a lunch break. We shared a halo-halo, which is shaved ice with condensed milk, red bean, jellies, tapioca balls and top with a piece of leche flan. The presentation looked better than it tasted. It was good but it lacked that factor, you know when it's so good that you want to keep eating it and not share. Rating is more for the disappointing halo-halo."}
{"text":"Very nice and quaint..good filipino food..the crazy little lady with short hair that sings all the time makes you so happy and welcoming..love her.. if your craving good homestyle filipino food, this place is for you... i would have gave more stars but, not enough food selection.."}
{"text":"They have balut.  The other food we had was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I had a chance to try their food today (12-28-13) it was nasty and bad service..i don't recommend this to our kababayan please save your time and money and try CAFE MODA on 3400 south Jones blvd."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've had better turon.   Turon.. what is that? It's a fat looking ripe banana that is wrapped in .. wrapper like a pig in a blanket. It is deep fried and then covered with caramelized sugar. There is also jackfruit inside of this crunchy concoction. I recommend eating Turon, but maybe buying it from another place."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place. It's a fast food Filipino joint that serves you up a good one or two item plate at a good price. I think some people are expecting the world by looking at some of these reviews. The food is pretty good and authentic tasting. I actually like it a lot. My favorites are the fried pork cracklins with meat attached, chicken and pork adobo and the beef steak with onions. I've been here with quite a few different people, also have been to the one at the Hawaiian market. I think the place is a hit or miss with people because of the authentic nature as compared to what you're going to get at Panda Express. I'm not a big microwave looking food eating kind of guy. I like real food that looks like it was cooked from atop a stove. I think this place grows on people, as it has on a few people I've gone with. Their reviews were so so maybe on a two star level after a first visit. But two different people, after trying it out with me a first time and being at a level two, ended up asking me if I wanted to eat at \"MY\" Filipino place. Which to me tells me both these individuals were not really at a two star rating. After a second visit I would estimate their star rating to be at a 3.5 to a 4. You kind of just have to give it a shot for yourself and don't be thrown off by the authentic look.. not all fast food joints have to cook their food in a microwave and have that rubbery consistency that a lot of people have come accustom to.  On another note, when I first use to go to Kapit.. the customer service wasn't the greatest. Now either I've been there so many times that they have warmed up to me or they have caught on that giving good service is a good business practice.. i don't know. For whatever it's worth, the food at the price was impressive enough for me to come back for more and I think if you give it a shot, you'll feel the same way. If you give it a 2 star rating, try it a second time and see if it has grown on you. It may take a visit or two to appreciate the authentic nature of the food."}
{"text":"First off, it does not matter if your customer is filipino or not, good customer service is universal. The lady that was behind the counter was extremely rude and unfriendly..no smile and just grunts when you ask a question. The fried rice was soggy and old and the tocino were rubbery. Breakfast for 2 was $20! Are you kidding me?? I really regret coming here.  Should have walked a lil bit further for my usual english muffin and coffee at starbucks under $5."}
{"text":"Good stuff...not one of those Chinese restaurants pretending to be Filipino. Not expensive either!"}
{"text":"We came here because we (all 15 of us filipinos) were craving some good food.  PROS: * Located close to our hotel.  In between Planet Holleywood and MGM Grand in the Hawaiian Village Marketplace. * They are open for breakfast for some topsilog cravings.  * Pork kabobs and lechon was good. * Staff was really friendly. * Pricing was affordable.   $7.45 for a two item combo & comes with a scoop of rice. * You can opt for garlic rice instead of the plain white rice.  (Too bad I didn't see this option when I ordered).  CONS: * They didn't have icecream or flan to make Halo Halo \"especial\", so I decided not to order this. *Pancit had too much cabbage."}
{"text":"I nearly didn't return to Kapit Bahay on my most recent trip.  The reason? They topped the halo-halo with oreo cookie ice-cream...and it didn't complement the halo-halo. THIS time, I asked and yes, they were serving it with UBE ice cream (yay).  I wish there was some way that they could market themselves better.  Maybe display the food differently?  As it is, the hot table looks rather pitiful...and if you're not familiar with the wonderful deliciousness of Filipino fare, the appearance might turn you off.  Just saying."}
{"text":"I am Filipino  and I know what is a true authentic Filipino dish - and the food at this place comes close to how my parents cook their traditional dishes (ok, maybe their dishes may not contain as much grease, but the taste reminds me of home cooked meals). I am honestly shocked at the lower ratings because this has to be one of the better Filipino restaurants I have tried. And trust me, I am a VERY picky eater. I have nothing to complain about. The food is great tasting, its cheap, and it's fast."}
{"text":"Great Filipino food, my fave is kaldereta and pancit. DELISH!!!! Prices are decent too, nothing fancy inside just tables to eat and on the other side, is a mini grocery area."}
{"text":"Mmmm....pussit.  Love me some purple squid.  Had some chicken caldereta too and it was good.  My mom enjoyed the sinigang and fried tilapia.  Kind of small portions for the price but I guess it's a little more expensive because it's on the strip.  A good selection of to go Filipino food.  Place is clean but nothing fancy.    Free parking in the back, enter on the small lot right before the Hawaiian Marketplace."}
{"text":"This place is soo good!.     In my many travels i rarely find a place like this. I'm glad i got off the freeway an exit too early.  The thing that grabbed my attention first was the Filipino fast food sign in the window.  After a long day of traveling and work I didnt want to drive around endlessly, or endure the usual fast food crap that's out there.    Im pretty sure it was Gloria that helped me, she was friendly, inviting and helped me identify a few dishes that were somewhat strange to me.    I ended up ordering longaniza that was fantastic, very tender and flavorful.  the second was a beef with potatoes and carrots and spices which reminded me of something my mom would cook.  Its nice to have flavors and a meal like this when a person is away from home  At the end of there these sugar glazed burrito looking things that i asked about, Gloria said it was dessert.  I think it was some type of pastry dough, with bananas maybe? and glazed with sugar.  I have no idea what these are called but the taste and texture  brought back a familiar flavor and texture that I haven't had since i was a kid.  if you're a visitor to the Las Vegas area and if you're not a club rat cruising the strip for tail, i suggest you take a quick drive, or taxi to china town and give this place a try.  People thought your review was:"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Customer service is poor. I called today to ask if they are selling DXN coffee, a lady answered the phone she said \"yes, I am busy. \" I asked how much and she replied, \" I'm not sure it's in my computer just come here for the price.\" VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERViCE!!!! She need some telephone etiquette, she answered the phone improperly And rude!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food reminds me of my mom's cooking. Decent price and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"During the middle of our trip to Vegas Nancy was craving some rice (it's an Asian thing), so we went to Kapit Bahay, a little hole-in-the-wall located on the far right end of the Hawaiian Marketplace (HM is between the Harley Davidson Cafe and MGM Grand). We both ordered the 2 item combo + rice: pusit and sinagang for Nancy, menudo and picadillo for me. The food was standard Filipino fare, nothing great, but not bad either. Nancy did like the Pusit (little squid).The food would rate 2 & 1/2 stars, but since we paid less than $20 for both meals and two cans of soda, that merits bringing up the overall rating to 3 stars. Not too many places on the Strip that you can get a decent meal for two people for under $20.  Don't expect too much with the service, it is completely utilitarian. Kind of like a cafeteria."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here. My boyfriend and I stopped in because we were excited to find a filipino fast food restaurant. As soon as we stepped in, we were glared down by the lady behind the counter. She rolled her eyes when I asked her what the dishes were (there were no signs and nothing looked like what she described it to be). The food was dry, and crusted over, and each dish was a monochrome color where you can't distinguish between the meat and the vegetable. The lady kept rolling her eyes as I looked at each dish. It got so bad that my boyfriend noticed and said we need to leave-- she clearly wasn't interested in our business. I had never experienced such rude behavior; and I wouldn't expect it from any reasonable person, much less from someone in a customer service role. I was caught off-guard by her animosity, as I was incredibly polite from the get-go; I considered that maybe it was a race thing but after reading several older reviews, I guess I feel slightly better that it wasn't personal-- sounds like her rudeness is non-discriminatory. Some people be cray."}
{"text":"its ok pinoy food it will never beat your mom or your tita's food but if you have an itch its not the worse fast food pinoy stuff in the world but certainly not something im not going to write home about..."}
{"text":"Really tasty. Was at Spring Mountain location, lady's a crack up. Loaded up for under $8."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kapit Bahay for quite a few years now...at least since 2006 or earlier and the great thing is that I can always count on consistency in great comfort food (Pork Sinigang for me)and friendly service with a smile.    I've tried other great Filipino Restaurants but keep coming back because it feels like coming home to eat.    Plus the variety of dishes you'd want is here which give you lots to choose from.    Whenever I have my Mom & Lola come into town to visit I know they will always find something to satisfy their appetite.  Today I ordered some Lumpia Shanghai for my company's Potluck party tomorrow.  I look forward to sharing with my colleagues a little piece of my culture with a favorite dish from my favorite Filipino Restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"chicken adobo and sisig was the best combination I had try from this place, friends and I frequent this place whenever we would like to eat something affordable."}
{"text":"Saturday morning after a long and enduring night of partying, they wanted some filipino breakfast.  It was around 11, and we assumed that they would have a full arsenal of breakfast food since, well, vegas doesn't wake up until then anyway.  They had the lunch items out, absent any common breakfast items like fried eggs, garlic rice etc. They did have langonisa and tocino though.   We got a combo which had lechon kawali, (yeah for breakfast, I know) and langonisa, and regular rice. The portioning was small, and for a pricey fee of $8.00   The only aspect of the meal I thoroughly enjoyed was the langonisa (am I spelling this correctly), everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"I was in the Las Vegas Chinatown looking for food.  I could not decide what to eat.  Then suddenly I saw the sign \"Filipino fast food\".  I was really surprised. This was the last thing I expected to see in Chinatown, let alone Las Vegas.  Since there is a shortage of Filipino restaurants, I decided it was a no brainer to go to this restaurant.  The place was virtually empty, compared to the packed mediocre Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.  I was not impressed by the decor and ambiance of the establishment.  The food was fine.  The customer service was not warm, but fast and efficient.  I order the ground beef dish, sausages, and rice.  Overall, the food is less greasier than what I normally expect from Filipino food.  The sausage had less fillings and was more lean and sweet, from what I usually expect from Filipino food  in San Francisco.  It was different, but good.  If I am in the Las Vegas Chinatown again, I would definitely go to this place and try out some other dishes."}
{"text":"No one was in the restaurant when we drove up and we saw the waitress swatting flies and decided that that wasn't a good sign."}
{"text":"I called here today to ask if they were open! Since Yelp had said that hours may have change since it's Presidents Day. I swear the lady that answered the phone was the rudest person I've ever talked to! No wonder that's the only job you can get! So uneducated! So shameful! They should train their employees to answer the phone. Not all businesses that answers the phone is open, that's why people call to ask... no need for sarcasm!   Food is not even that great!   Stay away from this place! Go find another filipino place... there are a lot better food and better customer service!  I didn't even dare go there after that phone call! Got me so upset!"}
{"text":"The woman behind the counter is so cute! The food is good and portion is awesome. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is drowning my food with canola oil! Yikes! Heart attack awaits me, if I continue to eat here!"}
{"text":"Kapit Bahay was my primary filipino food joint when I lived in the area.    FOOD: 4/5.  Every dish I've had here was pretty good.  Lechon kawali is my favorite.  Just gotta ask for extra sauce.  The fish and sinigang are my other recommendations. A 2 item combo is about $7.50.  My only gripe is they charge an extra 50 cents if you use a credit card.  SERVICE: 4/5.  They can be slow if the line is long.  But, they're usually quick.  AMBIENCE: 3/5. It's pretty much a fast food environment."}
{"text":"not really a big fan of Filipino food but this place is really good, reasonable price and not greasy at all, unlike most filipino places. Also, the owner is really nice."}
{"text":"place has hot food that acutally is good. great for take out and dine in although the place is small so it fills up fast. nothing remarkable about the food being served. all are staples in a typical pinoy fare."}
{"text":"'Sarap? No... Prepare to pay more too, neat!  Plus, let us clarify that this is not a relocated las Vegas Boulevard location... This is the original spot and the strip location was an off shoot.   The wife is a born and raised pinoy and I'm a Canadian who moved to the USA.  She loves the convenience but the quality of this buffet is lacking vs what is available just a few blocks away at nanay glorias.   The issue that I personally have is the price of some of the smaller items hon can take out that are not part of the buffet but instead widely available in China Town (as in 25 yards away in the grocery store.)   Don't charge me 30%+ more for baked goods that aren't even imported but instead baked here in the USA vs what everywhere else charges.   There are better buffets where you can actually serve yourself, but if you took a bus or walked from the strip, this is passable.   Simply focus on freshly made food and buy your snacks at the grocery store in the same commercial development."}
{"text":"Best Filipino Food in town. I was introduced to this great place by my best friend who's father when I was a teen used to make some flavor-filled dishes that woke both us up in the morning to a strong mouth-watering aroma that stinged your nose. But that very smell gave me the most greatest hunger. This place is very similar to how he used to cook his dishes for us.   They have a chain restaurants in CA also ( which I always go to) This is the only place I go when I have a craving for some authentic Filipino food... dishes like my favorite ground beef and veggies in a orange sauce or anything with chunks of meat in it with veggies.  My most favorite dish to get is the Pork Sinigang. It is thee best here. Soooo much kick in this soup... one spoon sip and you'll be gulping it down or putting it all over your rice. It's just the greatest tasting dish there. I cannot get enough of it. I usually take it to go in a big to go container and just enjoy the flavorful sour soup at home. It was a bunch of green beans, spinach or cabbage and chunks of pork meat in a tamarind base soup. If you don't like sour than skip this and try all the other great entrees.   There are so many to choose from and you just have to go with what looks good... well maybe not coz some dishes look messy and not that appealing but they sure taste delicious. Oh yea they also have this mango drink that I always get... very refreshing on a hot thirsty day. Don't forget the vinegar and garlic sauce that should be on the corner of the restaurant. It's an extra zig for your taste buds =)"}
{"text":"Tried using their website, it was not very useful or helpful. I couldn't call them either. I wasn't happy at all. Then I went there and I could get answer I needed to cater for my son's baby reveal. Don't think I'll be using them."}
{"text":"Looking for something quick and different--the \"Filipino Fast Food\" sign on this place fit the bill. It's tucked into the corner of the--crap for sale--circus/bazaar type huts.   What's nice about this place is that it's quiet. At least that's the case in February. The people behind the counter are nice. I just wish the food didn't taste like it had been out for a few too many hours.   If it weren't for that--this place would be three stars, because despite the aged food, I didn't think it was too bad. Cheap even!"}
{"text":"Who would expect this place to be on the strip in vegas?  We were looking for a cheap place to get a bite, and get away from the regular-vegas-strip-type-people for a minute, and this was the place.  The food was fresh, and it wasn't too expensive.  I'll go back!"}
{"text":"we ordered here for our christmas day, my friend recommend this filipino fastfood because of their pansit and lechon kawali, so we ordered pansit and lechon and added some menudo and chicken adobo... all i can say was everything is amazing and delicious as my friend told me.. my family and friends are so happy and stuffed.. the pansit is soooo good i promise and the lechon is the best of all.. even the adobo and menudo wont disappoint you, this is the best filipino dish i've ever tasted!!!"}
{"text":"I was hungry and wanted something filling and inexpensive.  Thank God my husband saw their sign as we were walking down the street.  It's located somewhere between Planet Hollywood and MGM at the back of one of the shopping complexes.  It's your typical turo-turo....go in, fall in line, point to whatever dish you want to order, the cashier at the end will ring up your bill.  I ordered lechon paksiw and binagoongang baboy... i was happy with my order.  My husband ordered beef steak and adobong pusit... he was happy with his order too.  If you're in the area and want inexpensive Filipino food, this place will do."}
{"text":"Some people may call me a hater but usually Im predisposed to think most Filipino food is too oily or too fried or too salty or some combo therein.  Kapit Bahay actually has proven me wrong.    Setup almost in a Panda Express style, there is a someone who dishes out what you  want from behind a glass partition.   Combo meals come with rice and can be substituted for pancit but in my opinion their pancit was nothing to write home about so keep your change.  All their options are relatively good.  Nothing will wow you and want to make you book the next flight to Manila but nothing will disappoint either.  The best of the bunch include the Chicken Adobo, Menudo, and Beef Caldereta.    Service is very friendly and approachable, which is what this gringo needs.   Another nice feature is they have their full menu prepared at opening at 9am, perfect if you need a lunch to go fast and don't want to deal with a soggy sandwich or janky fast food breakfast option elsewhere.   For under 5 dollars I can leave Kapit Bahay full every time...thats enough to make this hater put away his Hater-ade."}
{"text":"This was a suprise find, as others have mentioned, tucked away in the Strip. By no means is this the best Filipino food, but it's a great alternative to...well...pretty much any other \"quick\" food option on the Strip in my opinion.   But the one thing that gave me extensive pause was...wait for it...  They don't sell lumpia.   Whaaaat? The handful of times I've stepped in they've never had it and never even offered me a glimmer of hope such as \"We make it only on the weekends\" or \"We've just run out - you need to get here first thing in the morning.\"  They don't have lumpia. Period.   They do have limited entrees, and I've stuck with what I like best: Chicken Adobo. It's good, but not extraordinary. In the context of the geographic pinnacle of Vegas tourism however, that is more than enough for repeat visits."}
{"text":"Kapit Bahay moved to Chinatown. They are no longer in Hawaiian marketplace. (As of 5/20/2014) I am mourning. Lol. I can't walk from my hotel and get my nom nom on.  What Asian options do I have? Aha!! Dumpling & Noodle house :) it's not jungle food but it's suffice until they open another Filipino eatery that's walking distance. :)"}
{"text":"Foods okay.. Taste is good but too oily and greasy.. Cleanliness is okay too.. They have restroom and tv.. But less 2 star for the employees are rude not even greeting and smiling at all.."}
{"text":"Craved for Pinoy food while in Vegas and this place did not disappoint. Had lechon kawali and Bicol express (which I wished had more veggies). Nice staff- like eating at your kapitbahay's carinderia."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week and the place was packed, with a long line! We almost left, but they enticed us back with a fresh tray of lechon kawali (roast pork belly). I had Filipino-style corned beef and potatoes and oxtail stew (\"kare-kare\"). Boy were they good. Small, homey place, in a busy strip mall in a Chinese plaza. Lots of other foodstuffs for sale. The name of this place means \"neighbor\", but literally it means \"house-connected\" - shows you that Filipinos have close ties to their neighbors, as a culture. Price is reasonable as $6.50 for two viands and rice."}
{"text":"Kare-kare, menudo, fresh lumpia, arroz caldo, siopao, leche flan...all great Filipino dishes that you'll find on Kapit Bahay's website...  ...but won't find at the restaurant...at least when I was there.  Admittedly, I probably got a little too excited to finally try some non-family-made Filipino cuisine, and the location--right on the Las Vegas Strip across from the City Center--was super-convenient.  I ended up with a disappointing experience--getting a plate of rice with pancit and pork adobo and a side of longaniza.  The longaniza was okay, but the pancit and adobo were pretty unexciting.  This, with a can of Coke, was about $10.50--a little pricey for the relatively small portions you get."}
{"text":"I just finished eating and it will be my last. The skinny middle aged woman was has the worst customer service ever. She was so rude and forgot to give me my second scoop of rice, but I didn't complain because I will never come in here again, food was okay but I had better and better customer service.... stay away from this place. Nanay Gloria's or itoy sariling atin is better"}
{"text":"This place was EH.  Similar concept to Pinoy Pinay if you've been.  You pick out one or two items of your choice, etc.    Lady that helped us was friendly. It wasn't busy when we went.  We dined in.  It was kind of hot inside.  We sat under an air vent that was apparently blowing air, but I felt hot.    Anyway, as for the food, one would think that no matter what, pancit would usually be on the steam table.  Kare Kare, I know some places serves it on certain days, and yes some days, people run out.  First off, the food on the steam table honestly in my opinion didn't look too appealing.  I can understand that Kare Kare can run out and it so happen on this day they were out.  They didn't have pancit on the line.  But I'm guessing I could have ordered it on the side, but I then I would have to wait.  What I thought was banana lumpia was actually their vegetable lumpia, and the price of just one, I thought was ridiculous.  Close to $2.50 was for one mediocre egg roll.  Their cantaloupe drink, when I ordered it, it wasn't ready.  It was a 10 min wait.  Good thing I like cantaloupe drinks, so I waited for it.    It just seemed like they were just out of a lot of things that may have been there earlier in the day.   Is this a spot that I would recommend anyone to try?  No.  Is it a place that I'd return to?  No.  Compared to Pinoy Pinay, their selection may not be a whole lot, but at least the food looks appealing enough to try.  Here, it just wasn't there.    So with all that being said, happy eatings!  Until next time!  @~~}~~~~"}
{"text":"it's a homestyle Fillipino fast food near 99 Ranch in Chinatown. My second time here for a quick inexpensive take away.   The dining area is casual with plenty of seating.  They were tasty meal. For $7.25 you can get a two entrée combo with rice. I had the pork Adobo which was tasty and a beef dish which I am not sure of the name.  I recommend them to put a label on their food.  The customer service is not the greatest but the portion of the food were plentiful. Good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"If you are craving for some quick Filipino food, this is the place to be. I'm not saying that it's the best one the city, but it's definitely quick and convenient. All the food is already laid out there for you, and all you have to do is to pick and choose to your liking. There have options of one or two entree meals which I think is well worth it if you get the two entree.   Every time we go there, the same ladies always helps us. I love it when she's there because she's very welcoming. She just has this kind of Filipino grandma persona that makes you want to buy some more items. Beware, if you're not Filipino, there could be some language barrier here. So, sometimes she could mean something as a compliment but it sounds a bit harsh to the ear. So, keep that in mind if you do decide to come here.   I usually get the sinigang here because I'm a fan of soup. I have to admit that it's down to the very basic. Sinigang, at least to me, is supposed to be sour. Similar to Thai food's tom yum soup, but this one in particular almost tasted bland. I still like the hint of sourness to it. Again, it's basic Filipino food so I can't complain.   Among other food, they have a pretty cool selection of snacks on the side that you can easily grab and purchase. I love the choices here even though the selection is pretty small. Regardless, they remind me of my childhood which is pretty awesome.   The setting on this place isn't in its best shape as it almost looks run down. It's literally grab your food, sit and eat. This place definitely need renovation."}
{"text":"Nasty! Service sucked! Rude ppl, no business, food no good. Don't go!"}
{"text":"If you are in Chinatown and want Filipino food, please go somewhere else this was probably the most bottom of the barrel Filipino food I've ever had in my life.  Disgusting and under seasoned."}
{"text":"I  did order the two item combo, with beef caldareta , sinigang, and rice. The prices were decent . The rice was probably sitting too long in the cooler because it was too dry, but it wasn't even warm. The way the food options looked , it was hard to decide because it was mostly covered in oil. I couldn't  really taste the caldareta sauce , fail!! The upside is that the sinigang was warm and tasty. The bok Choy was overcooked so I had to toss it. I wo t come back unless they work on the recipes."}
{"text":"pros...since i am reminiscing about last year's thanksgiving in Las Vegas, i might as well yelp this other place as well.  this is what i find to be a typical pilipino style restaurant.  kapit bahay means neighbor in tagalog the national dialect of the philippines.  so i guess it just depends on how well your neighbor cooks as to whether you like their food or not.  this particular neighbor, which really it was a neighbor cause it was in the store fronts directly in front of the polo towers, was ok.  service was typical asian restaurant, nothing to write home about.  the food was decent, and was at least warm.  the place was clean but not tidy, as there were take out boxes and other things out in the open.  not bad, but not exactly inviting either.    i had orderd the longanisa or philippine style sausage, short and fat and this one was full of fat.  some eggs and some regular rice.  there was a choice of garlic fried rice, but i like to stick with something fresh, or is it \"presh\"?  as the chances of the garlic fried rice being from leftover rice is most likely, but of course that's what you're supposed to make it out of, it's just better.  i got bottled water. typical breakpast.    cons...well this one i think was being renovated or something, as they had exposed beams and other heating and ventilation ducts hanging outside of the drop down ceiling tiles.  the place was clean but not tidy, and the little store made snacks were out on display were just casually strewn about haphazardly.  but nothing \"dirty\", just not very neat."}
{"text":"This is a small Filipino cafeteria (turo-turo) style restaurant; located by the strip - across the street from Monte Carlo Hotel.  The restaurant itself was clean; the set up was simple - nothing special about the look or feel of this place.  But the food was actually very good - surprisingly good; taste authentic.  The service, however, was a disappointment.   I always expect Filipino restaurants to have a warm and friendly service bec. Filipinos and the Philippines are known for their one of a kind hospitality... so it's very rare to see Filipino servers who are frowning, stoic or worst just plain abrupt.  Maybe I just caught them in a bad day.  Anyhow, for a fast food \"turo-turo\" style, food here was pretty impressive. They also serve generous portions.  Price was average.  We ordered fried tilapia, Kare kare, pork sinigang, pork and chicken longanisa, which I may add was absolutely yummy.  Had the service been better, I would have given this place a solid 4 stars rating."}
{"text":"I'd been craving Filipino food recently, so I decided to stop in here to satisfy that feeling. Kapit Bahay, located in the Chinatown Plaza, probably has the most authentic traditional Filipino dishes I've had in Vegas so far.   The name of the restaurant, which loosely translates to \"neighbor's house,\" is fitting because the interior decor might remind someone of a traditional Filipino household. The inside is small and does not have a lot of tables, so it fills up quick. The staff was super friendly to me and was quick to serve, despite it being a little busy in there. Just on the other side of the food line, there's a grocery area where filipino snacks and other products (eskinol, efficascent oil, etc.) are sold.  They give out big portions at a good price, so it's pretty affordable (even if you do decide to get extra items or things from their grocery section). I had the kaldereta, pork adobo, and their chicken tinola. All were very flavorful and SUPER close to how my mom makes filipino food (but let's be honest, nothing ever beats your family's cooking).  They didn't have labels for their food, so you'd either have to ask about them or know for yourself what you're getting. I don't think their menu is set, so it's basically whatever they decide to cook that day is what they'll be serving. I'm pretty sure they always have the popular \"staple\" dishes like Adobo and Lechon available all the time.   Overall, I think this place is definitely for those people who love filipino food in the style closest to it's roots (and yes, sometimes being \"too oily\" is part of that). The food is very authentic, affordable, and you get good portions! A must-try if you want to try food that reminds you of home."}
{"text":"Rude! F u mean filipino lady behind the counter talking behind my back in tagalog.  I'm Filipino, duh. WORST service. Mediocre food. Halo halo sucks."}
{"text":"During the Fringe Festival at the nearby Las Vegas Little Theatre, I had time between shows for a dinner break.  Kapit Bahay was recommended to me by a good friend and he didn't mislead.  He said this was the kind of food his mother made and he grew up eating.  That sold me.  I walked in and immediately had a problem because most of the Filipino names were unintelligible to me.  Some things were not marked.  I got a 2 item platter to eat in and I knew I wanted the lechon.  Then I asked the woman what an item was and she told me it was silverfish.  This is a Filipino omelette with fish.  That then became my second dish.  As I was carrying my tray to the table, the woman asled me what kind of soup I wanted.  She decided I should have chicken soup and she filled a styrofoam cup with soup.  The soup was very good.  This was homemade and the broth was rich.  The lechon was a bit dry but I guess I shouldn't expect anything else.  It's a fast food place with the dishes already prepared and in warming trays like a buffet.  Of course it's going to be a bit try.  The skin was very crispy and flavorful and the dipping sauce you get made up for some of the dryness of the lechon.  I had never had the tortang dulong before and I'm glad I tried it.  The fish in the omelette was a good fit.  The omelette could have been hotter--heat lamps only do so much, but it was enjoyable.  Customer service was great!  The woman was being a surrogate sister for me making sure I had my soup with this hearty meal.  The price was certainly right, and the location was perfect!"}
{"text":"All I can say was that the menudo was so good...  After all the American food we've been eating in this trip I wanted some rice on our last full day in Las Vegas... I'm not talking about Spanish rice or risotto rice or rice pilaf... although they're all yummy too, but I wanted good ole' white rice (not Uncle Ben's) or fried rice so where do we go? we head to Las Vegas Chinatown.   This Chinatown Plaza in Las Vegas isn't anything like the Chinatown in San Francisco oh, heck no. This place is much smaller and clean! This is not too far from the Strip either. It's clean (okay, I said it twice) and easy to navigate to. Oh, but I digress... we were looking forward to a nice Chinese food dinner when we saw this \"Kapit Bahay\" Filipino eatery in the corner of this plaza. I wondered if this was the same fast food restaurant located at the Hawaiian Marketplace on the Strip which is no longer there when we looked for it. Anyway, at this location at the Chinatown Plaza we were glad that it was still open that late at the time.   This 'turo-turo'-style family run restaurant had one other customer so we had the whole restaurant to ourselves pretty much. We each had the 2-item combo ($7.50) and when I saw the menudo still available I wanted it. We had some type of beef (not sure of the name) and also sinigang. The food was excellent and flavorful... definitely satisfied our hunger. The middle of the restaurant had a table-full of popular Filipino snacks! you name it they had it! Bought me a couple packages of my favorite Choc-Nut. The elder lady (\"lola\") behind the counter was very nice and friendly and definitely showed us that Filipino hospitality... not just to us but also to foreign nationals that came in and bought food \"to go\". Salamat po.  Review #0907"}
{"text":"Most disgusting filipino restaurant in the universe!!! Lol! Everything here doesn't taste right. It's funny how many people say they have the best food. Are guys serious? Have you ever tasted a home cooked filipino dish? The food looks okay, but the taste is far from what it supposed to taste like. Disgusting. That's all i can say. And one more thing, if you wanna deal with a crazy server, this is the best place to go to. The old lady here is annoying. Good luck eating their disgusting food"}
{"text":"We came across this Filipino fast food place, wasn't too sure about the food at first but decided to give it a shot, we were impressed! We had Filipino food at Singapore and Bali, it brought us back memories, definitely authentic. If you like strong species and able to take it, you will love it. We finished our food in no time and bought more to go! Food was super cheap for the portion given. The owner was so nice and friendly, I will definitely recommend for people who are down to try different type of food."}
{"text":"I'm not big on Filipino take out but the girls wanted Filipino food and this was right next door to our hotel.  The food is better tasting than Goldilocks but some of the stuff looks like it was from the day before. I had the pork tocino with the garlic rice and I didn't finish it. It wasn't bad, it just didn't compare to my dad's awesome cooking. Just Like I said, I'm not big on Filipino fast food.   The 3 stars are for when we were fiending Asian rice and they were able to accomodate. LOL"}
{"text":"If you want Filipino food and you opted to hit Spring Mtn. Rd. instead of going to Maryland Pkwy, then this is the place to go. It's a cute little corner turo-turo (point point) fast food joint and the food is prepared decently. A downside is that their portions are little and it's hard to find a spot to sit here so don't bring a big crowd or go during peak hours."}
{"text":"Running into this filipino restaurant was hilarious! I was with family and uh, my cousin was a little drunk walking into this place. Singing and everything! It was only 3pm!! That's what Vegas does to you! haha! Anyways, not only were the owners/employees and even some other customers laughing, they were singing too! haha! The food was really good and satisfying! I normally don't have to pay for my sabow (sinigang soup) with my meal but Kapit charged 50 cents? or was it 25? I forget so I was a littled bummed it wasn't included. We enjoyed our meals though! Great prices and good food!"}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy, but the ladies that work here are very friendly and welcoming, and the food is good, Filipino comfort food at a good price. The dining area is very simple, clean, with plenty of seating, and you can watch Filipino TV programming while you eat. They've got a small grocery  section with package goods and a couple of coolers with drinks and juices. I've been coming here for years and the place never changes.  I recommend dropping in for a quick bite to eat, I wish it was closer to where I lived, but that doesn't keep me from making the drive."}
{"text":"This place is ok except for the fact that they run out of Lechon every afternoon. I don't get it? If Lechon is such a popular dish why not make sure they always have some on hand? I tried what was the 3 rd attempt to get Lechon and again they ran out with the explanation that they only get them on Thursdays? I didn't understand that or misunderstood but all I heard was only on Thursdays?.. Guess I'll be going to Cafe Moda from now on for my Lechon they ALWAYS seem to have it on hand all through the night too!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning after a long and enduring night of partying, they wanted some filipino breakfast.  It was around 11, and we assumed that they would have a full arsenal of breakfast food since, well, vegas doesn't wake up until then anyway.  They had the lunch items out, absent any common breakfast items like fried eggs, garlic rice etc. They did have langonisa and tocino though.   We got a combo which had lechon kawali, (yeah for breakfast, I know) and langonisa, and regular rice. The portioning was small, and for a pricey fee of $8.00   The only aspect of the meal I thoroughly enjoyed was the langonisa (am I spelling this correctly), everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"Be wary of this place, they recently had a C rating for the health inspection.   The food is very greasy, the woman is very unpolite, and the rice is not firm, it's mushy. After hearing about the bad health inspection rating, I know I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR SHAVED ICE ONLY!  If you're looking for shaved ice on the strip, this is the place. It's a hidden gem in the Hawaiian Marketplace, inside Kapit Bahay. Prices are extremely reasonable, a small is $3 and a regular is $4.   With your order you can add 3 toppings!   The quality of the ice and the flavors are spot on, and the owner doesn't gip you with the quantity of ice, it's definitely more than enough"}
{"text":"Poor service. Tasteless food. Everything was disappointing and not worth the money. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Walking in, the place was clean and relatively organized.  I smile where ever I find myself and usually receive warm responses in return.  The women working  were less than friendly.  The items on the menu I wanted to order, they were out. So I took a chance on the pork adobo and the chicken curry.  They were okay but very oily.  The rice was nothing special...just white rice.  I will likely not return."}
{"text":"My friends recommended this place to me the last time I was in Vegas, but it was closed when I checked it out. I was able to check it out this past weekend when I was in Vegas again.  The place is a hole in the wall, and it looks a bit dingy. It is right next to an Asian massage parlor.  It seems to be a family run restaurant. The lady who served me was very nice and friendly. She kept on asking me questions whether i tried Filipino food before, and she provided recommendations.  For the amount that they give you, the price you pay is awesome. You get a nice bang for your buck. THe chicken adobo is boneless so that's a plus, and the gravy is sooo good to mix in the rice with. I also tried the beef stew, which she recommended to me. it was peanutty and yummy. I wish I ordered with a bit more spice, but I'm not sure if Flip food has spicy dishes? I'm not sure. I wouldn't mind coming back here again for some cheap grub when I'm back in Vegas since it is walking distance on the strip to MGM, Aria, etc...  PS - the food didn't look appetizing on the steamer trays since it looked all dried up, but it was still pretty tasty and moist."}
{"text":"I have come to the conclusion that there are no Filipino vegetarians. They do have vegetable dishes here, but all made with fish or meat stocks. Located in the Hawaiian Village Kapit Bahay offers authentic Filipino cuisine. The shop itself is warm and inviting, the food is fresh and kept well. The woman at the counter offered many samples to my friends. Reviews from the others were that the Pork Adobo and Chicken Curry dishes were good. My Filipino friend thought the Halo Halo was good as well. Prices were very reasonable for fresh, authentic food right on the strip. So while there was no vegetarian options, I do like saying Halo Halo."}
{"text":"This was the first time eating at a Filipino restaurant, and the items here were pretty good I thought.  We walked in and looked at all the dishes available, and were amused to see another couple, very touristy looking, (You know, the type that would normally eat at Chili's or PF Chang's on vacation) walk in a few minutes later, take one look at the food, then walk quickly out.  Other than the chicken adobo, I honestly don't know the names of the other items we ordered, but one of them was a pork belly dish with shrimp paste, another was a clear noodle dish.  The flavors in the entrees are strong, and for the most part, I really liked them.  The pork dish with shrimp did start to lose its appeal halfway through though, as I started to get tired of the strong seafood taste in the background.  The chicken adobo was probably my favorite.  It had a hint of more vinegar than other adobos I've had, which I thought gave it a little more extra flavor.  The portions are pretty good, and they also sell Filipino snacks and drinks in the shop as well."}
{"text":"Not Happy with customer Service Here...I'm Order Fish Head but She Gave me the tail part.i returned it and She said No No No...it Was Great Service before ,now Service going Down.i dont think She's Happy to Work Here."}
{"text":"Saw cockcroaches crawling on the floor. And there was hair on my togo when I got home. Threw the food into the trash"}
{"text":"Owners/servers are rude. 3 of us bought 2 vegetable eggrolls and 2 banana eggrolls and when we ask for napkins, the \"husband/server\" looked at us like \"What you want napkins?\" and gave us 3 napkins. No thank you's like you would get from American restaurants. While I was waiting for the vegetable eggrolls, the \"wife/server\" ask me if I want vinegar and when I said no, this is what she said, \"Don't think that I pour the vinegar on your eggroll, it comes separate in a container.\" First of all, I don't like vinegar, period. Why the insult? Since the 3 of us are going to LA in separate vehicles, I ask for another plastic bag for myself and the \"wife/server\" had a frown on her face and sort of \"flung\" the bag to me without saying anything. For $2.00, their vegetable eggrolls taste like paper and their $1.50 banana eggrolls are so sweet you can't find the bananas. Most Filipinos are nice or try to be nice but this dive is something I wouldn't patronize again."}
{"text":"The food was greasy & over priced for 2 items was almost $10. I only tried it because of the other reviews & was disappointed with taste, selection of food & price."}
{"text":"IMO some of the best Filipino food in Las Vegas. Kapit Bahay has definitely become the Filipino restaurant that I compare other Filipino restaurants to. The food can be a bit on the oily side sometimes but I don't think its any different than sipping spoonfuls of clarified butter. What... doesn't everyone do that?"}
{"text":"Hella hit the spot when needing Filipino food.  Reasonably priced, and wide selection from lechon pacsil (sp?) to longanisa to ampalaya to sinigang to chicken adobo to BBQ to caldereta... The list goes on.  Makin it hard for a girl to choose for a 2-item combo.... Dang, now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Yea ok so I know this chain from LA as well. But when this opened up here. I'm not sure if the smell is that fantastic inside. If you're not used to filipino food. Go easy. Don't try the fish right away. Go easy - try the lechon, (crispy pork) or even the beef caldareta, maybe chicken or pork adobo, just don't hurt yourself. Pancit noodles and lumpia are always safe. Sometimes I eat here and I get sick from all the fatty stuff. So eat in moderation if you have the same problem. If you want a nice sit down filipino place - Try Salo Salo grill. Most of the places in town are buffet like. Thus a lot of times the food has been sitting...Hehehe I said thus....What a funny word."}
{"text":"Food here was really good or was i just really hungry and extremely buzz from the marquee day club pool party..but other than that, the prices were reasonable..big portion..they hook it up! i forgot what i had..i think it was menudo and pork adobo..gggggreasy goodness..served over a bed of rice..i think it came out to under $5..parking here is a bit packed..especially during the night scenery..but overall..amazing filipino food..until next time"}
{"text":"Had some halo halo and it was good.  Hard to find but worth it for Filpino fast food."}
{"text":"Found out that there was a Filipino restaurant on the strip so we decided to get breakfast here.  The employees seemed somewhat rude... I guess they have to deal with drunk people a lot but it's no excuse.  The food was nothing special and they charged my cousin like $2-3 for a fried egg.   They sell a few snacks from the PI as well such as chips."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Jacksonville and decided to check out some of the Filipino restaurant here. Saw Kapit Bahay which was besides 99 Ranch (had to get some breakfast stuff). I ordered the Chicken Apritada and Pinakbet. I wasn't impressed at all, Apritada tasted different, not even close to how it's supposed to taste. Pinakbet was not that good either, my home version tastes a lot better than theirs. They had goat stew which wasn't that bad.  I'll check out other restaurants but would NEVER come back here."}
{"text":"i came here on the recommendation of a friend who had breakfast here.   working a trade show in vegas make you crave for some down home cooking. sadly enough i could cook better than this restaurant with one eye closed.  my craving for rice was satisfied, but the whole filipino food experience was extremely dissatissfied.   the only thing i like about this place is the fact that they have sarsi.  if you have a car, im pretty sure there are other filipino places out there that would be better off."}
{"text":"On this day, a good friend and I went shopping. But not just any kind of shopping. Today was a day of shopping for Asian foods, beauty products and medicinal herbs. What a day! Foods, creams and spices I've never heard of. I just took it all in. When we were finished, I was definitely hungry! Right next door was Kapit Bahay. I was definitely excited to try it out as I LOVE Filipino food.   When you walk in, you're definitely taken to a blast in the past, it seems like.  The walls were faded canary yellow, the tiling, tables and chairs were definitely outdated, to say the least. In the corner, the restaurant also doubled as a mini mart, selling snacks and goodies specific to the Philippines. The counter reminded me of a Filipino version of Panda Express. Most of the food was already prepared and lined up ready to order. The two ladies that were working the counter was a bit strange to me.  On one hand, they were super nice, but they had no patience! It was almost like I was expected to know everything and what I wanted. I felt a little rushed so I just chose the two items that I could pick out right away.   For lunch, I got the 2 choice combo for $6.50.  I'll definitely give them that.  The price is affordable and very attractive to the audience. For my choices, I got the Pork Adobo and the Lechon. Pork Adobo is a pork cooked in soy sauce, vinegar and other spices. For this choice, it tasted like the adobo was sitting out for a while.  The meat was super dry and chewy.  The broth was also way too oily for my taste, but had a nice flavor to it, not too salty. The lechon was also a turnoff for me.  Lechon is roasted pork, including the skin and fat. This lechon tasted like it was under the heat lamp for a long time.  The meat was way to hard to chew through. I ended up abandoning that side, when all said and done.  At the end of our meals, my friend and I agreed that this wasn't the best of the best. I could tell some of the choices were really authentic, however, I think they need to rotate their food a little more so we (as customers) are getting the best of what they have to offer. Living on the other side of town, the best way I can put it is that fact that I probably wouldn't make a special trip to this restaurant if ever craving Filipino food.  Especially when there are other great joints along the way."}
{"text":"There are some standout dishes I've eaten here:  Kare Kare was actually pretty on when I went. The BBQ chicken sticks were yummy with the usually sweet Filipino glaze, but the chicken was juicy and not dry.   and some are just okay:  Beef steak was a bit too greasy last time.   Have not anything bad per se. I prefer Itoy Sariling Atin, but it's far. This is a more logical option to feed my moments where I just want my peoples food. Haha I'm probably one of the few Filipinos who don't cook at home AND eat out Filipino food for 90% of meals so I actually have Flip food cravings"}
{"text":"I found it surprising when I saw this one day walking to work at PH. A Flipino spot on the strip? Why yes, in the Hawaiian marketplace.   I get tired of the stuff in my work so I grab some to-go for my lunch one day. It was early so I got the \"breakfast\" items- Tocino and Tapa and was able to get garlic rice. Decent and hit the spot.   Have also had their lechon, beef steak, kare kare, BBQ sticks,torta talong/eggplant, fried milkfish/bangus, etc and it's pretty standard and decent, but I've had better. Still the location was definitely appealing. Come here if youre on the strip looking for \"different\" cheap eats, but if you have a car go take a drive to some other Filipino spots off strip."}
{"text":"We come here specifically for their Lechon. Half of the time we are too late :( they usually sell out before lunch. But it's so fantastic, the best I've had in Vegas, that we always come in hopes anyway.   Everything is authentic and delicious! You really can't go wrong. Another favorite of mine is the adobo. JD has enjoyed everything he's ordered here, which is pretty much everything. Their generous with their portions for the price point. It's a great value and you'll leave full, probably with a container of leftovers too.   The lovely ladies serving you your food have come to recognize and remember us because we've been going here for so long. Super sweet, inquisitive and direct just like all Filipino aunties :)"}
{"text":"Go figure my family would want Filipino food in Vegas. We went here for take out one night and it was BAD. The tinola (chicken dish) and balatong (mung bean dish) tasted spoiled. YUCK. The apritada (chicken dish) had a funny taste almost fishy. My uncle called to inform them about their shortcomings and they offered to give us some free food for a second chance. So my family decided to take them up on their offer. The next morning we had breakfast there. I was bummed they didn't have longanisa (typical breakfast sausage). I opted for the veggie dish which was soo greasy and tasteless. Not impressed nor did their redeem themselves. My family ordered the tuyo, omelette with fish, and lechon. They all agreed it was good, but too greasy!   I think they're other Filipino joints in Vegas and this one is a miss -- onto the next one!"}
{"text":"Loved it, we had to drive to jollibee for Filipino food from palazzo costing us 30 dollars! This was right on the strip. Food was awesome and we are grabbing some halo halo to go in order to beat the heat! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Why does their longonisa look like hot dogs? :(   This place wasn't bad... their pusit & shrimp paste(dunno the name) dish was pretty good, but they don't give enough rice and the sinigang was super watery... and not sour at all :(   & I was drunk so I don't even remember if it was reasonably priced or not hahah"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch accidentally after a supposedly lunch with friends who invited us to their time share building which was around the area.  After looking around for for almost an hour (nobody seems to know them ) We gave up and decided to go back to our hotel .  We walked pass this Filipino restaurant right on the mall entrance & decided to give it a try . It looked pretty decent & clean & the staff seem quite friendly.  There is a buffet alright but choices are limited ..and since it was already pass 2:00 pm my hunger pangs are beginning to react. .  My friend & I tried their combo.  2 Kinds of dishes with rice for  $6.99 .  I had the   Pork Adobo & Pampano Sinigang.  It was not  the best but I was hungry ... I finished it in a flash !! . That's probably why there was just one table occupied .  My friend ordered the  Pinakbet  & Paksiw.   Nothing really compares to that Kusina ni Lorraine Buffet which to me is one of  the best Filipino buffets in Vegas so far.  Would I go back to this Place  ?  Probably not  !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place for the first and LAST time today. I ordered take out. First of all, I was \"greeted\" by two women, perhaps mother and daughter. I use the term greeted very loosely, as they barely acknowledged my presence.The younger one was so engulfed by some soap opera that she acted like me asking questions about the food was interrupting her. Then she updated the older woman in Tagalog about the show. Or at least I'm assuming that what she was doing. I find that talking in front of your customers in a language the customer can't understand is RUDE, I don't care what language it is. So onto the food.....  GROSS! The lumpia was cold and old. My husband, who rarely complains or sends back food, made a u turn in the street to return the lumpia. The older woman says \" do you want me to put it in the microwave?\" My husband said, \"No, I'd like a fresh batch.\" He was then told that they already made some and they're not making anymore. So he got his money back. So, we get home and tried the chicken and pork adobo. Old, dry with a weird after taste. But we were home and didn't feeling like driving back and facing those people again.  One last thing. As my hubby was walking out, the old woman had the nerve to ask my husband if he could throw the lumpia away. Hello?? YOU WORK HERE, YOU THROW THEM OUT!!! Pitiful."}
{"text":"Some good Filipino food served here. Reminds me of my mother-in-law's cooking (hers is better though) and they have a pretty good selection. Their version of Lumpia is awesome. It's huge and packed with meaty/veggie goodness. Good value but their portions could use some increasing and their canned drinks are costly."}
{"text":"Food is too expensive for no reason. Charged for 2 entree when it was only 1 entree and they wouldn't refund for THEIR mistake. Food also was not fresh at all. No wonder they always get shut down on dirty dining."}
{"text":"Chicken adobo and rice. My favorite dish. Unfortunately they only serve fried rice in the morning, I came in the late afternoon with my wife so we missed out. I would have to rate the chicken adobo a 2 out of 5 stars; bland taste better off getting some mama sita adobo packets and making it at home. Otherwise nice and clean mom and pop shop, my wife and I can barely feel the ac so expect to get a little moist now that it's summer. I paid with a credit card which added just .50 cents to my meal so your better off bringing cash. Hostess very nice and caring just like an auntie should be. It's right next to the Chinese mall and grocery store. So after you eat stretch out your stomach and walk around and see more restaurants and small shops and plenty of foot massage locations."}
{"text":"I went here ten years ago and it was bad. Yesterday, I thought I would give them another chance. The food was disappointing. The pork sinigang was over cooked and dry. The rice was crunchy. I will never go here again. I also bought sweet rice wrapped in banana leaves and it was over priced and disgusting. You can go to the 99 Ranch market and get better food."}
{"text":"After 3 days of eating on The Strip, we needed a different atmosphere and better flavor.  This place totally fit the bill.  I'm not an aficionado on this kind of cuisine but to me, it tasted like good, home cooking and it was served by an absolutely delightful lady.  She would sing every time she was ringing up an order at the cash register and she was very kind and hospitable.  I asked if I could take her picture but she declined.  I would love to come back and eat here next time we're in town! I had the Afritada (sp?).  Deeeelish."}
{"text":"Pan fried fish, chicken (looked like it had curry sauce), and pork with two sides of rice = $13!   It was probably the cheapest meal I had in Vegas and it was good. I only fish their food was labeled since I am not familiar with Filipino food. Now if someone came in and was not familiar with Asian food at all... he/she would be in trouble."}
{"text":"I was stuck in traffic on the strip - no surprise!  But, I was SO hungry after my flight that when I saw the word 'Bahay', I became so excited and did a jacked up turn to make it into the parking lot.    Stepping inside was like heaven.  Especially to a person delusional from hunger.  They have all the Filipino food you could imagine...honestly, it was that big of a selection.    After much debate, I decided on the kare-kare (ox-tail in peanut butter) and sinagang (tamarind broth soup).  With a heaping pile of steamed rice.  Under $10.  Deal alert!    The kare-kare was realllllly good.  (ALMOST as good as my mom's.)  You know how some places skimp out on the peanut butter?  Nope, not this place!  Peanut buttery goodness.    Sinagang, yum.  It had so many veggies and such a nice broth that it balanced the heaviness of the kare-kare.  I think I sat in the booth for a good 10 min after I was done eating. Food coma at its finest."}
{"text":"All right food.  Ate here because it was near work. All they had were pork selections. I wanted chicken.   Pancit was decent, but next time all just go parents house."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing employees. Been going here 15 years, and will continue to frequent here with my family. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. Reasonably priced, and tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow, harsh reviews!  I found the guy behind the counter helpful.  He steered me in the right direction and I got a meal I really enjoyed.   BBQ'd tilapia and Chicken Adobo were very tasty."}
{"text":"Be forewarned, the \"spring rolls\" (yes, that's what the lady behind the counter called them) are filled with tofu. So unfortunate.  I've eaten a fair amount of Filipino food in my life, and for whatever reason, I have NO idea what the names of any dishes are aside from halo halo, pancit and lumpia. It's actually pretty aggravating because I can describe the dish, but I can't name it.  There is a beef and onions dish, kinda like a stew almost that is killer here. Pancit is just okay. I've been to this location a few times, and really, the beef and onions dish is the only thing that sticks out to me (because it is my favorite anywhere that I go.)   Be careful not to say that you want a personal size anything. Make sure you say plate. Pancit, 4 spring rolls and that beef dish ran me $17. A 2 item plate is $6. Same size servings I believe, but $3 more expensive and without rice if you accidently order like I did. Ummm... guess what look I'm doing with my face right now. My \"not amused face:\"  -__-"}
{"text":"My husband suggested trying this place out and of course on Christmas Day not many places are open. Walking inside, it's a typical small store/ restaurant for quick food. My husband orders the lechon and was in love. I had gotten the adobo and order a party tray for my potluck at work later on that night for only $18. The lady was so nice and generous to us. Her food was very home good happy. If you expect to have a 5 star dinner don't come here but if you want the moms Filipino home cook happy meal, this is the place sometimes it's not always about the food, it's the love that goes in it and the hospitality of the place."}
{"text":"I'm such a coconut, but I really love my native cooking.  Unfortunately, every time I've asked a relative how to make certain dishes, they've told me they have no recipe, and that they cook \"according to taste\".  The funny thing is that no matter who makes the Filipino food I love so much, it tastes exactly the way it's supposed to taste!  My hockey teammate brought me here with her relatives, and as soon as I walked in, it felt like I was home with my dad.  I ordered the combo with rice, chicken adobo, and pansit.  I also ordered fried rice.  The portions were just like what I would have had at my family get togethers, meaning gimongous!  And it totally tasted like the pansit, rice, and chicken adobo my dad, aunt, and grandma made!  Yummy!  I was thrilled to see they have a restaurant in Anaheim, which actually is miles from where I live, but at least I know where to go if I'm craving Filipino food near Disneyland!  The strip mall they call Chinatown is kind of funny because I never thought there would be a large enough contingent of Asians to support Asian businesses in Vegas.  So cool to see this here."}
{"text":"The food here is alright. I had a two item combo with Kare-Kare and BBQ Chicken.  Kare-Kare - I definitely have had better. I thought it was bland. Also, you have the option to not have any tripe in your serving, which is kind of nice.  BBQ Chicken - This item was good. It is kind of like my mom's marinade, but obviously, I love hers better.   The lady who helped me was super funny. She kept calling me \"baby.\" It made my experience interesting.  I am not sure if this place is the best in Las Vegas for Filipino food. I definitely will be trying other places first before I ever come back."}
{"text":"Adobo was too greasy and the puncit had been sitting out a long time by the time I got there. Pass on the Halo Halo. No flavor."}
{"text":"I never know what I am going to get when I walk into a Filipino restaurant.  Sometimes it's good service sometimes it is not.  This time it was the latter.  The older tita-looking lady was nice and wanted to serve me, she actually acted like she had a stake in the business and it's customers.   The younger ate'-looking woman, looked at me when I came in, turned around, but then assisted some other customer when they walked in.  I clearly stated that I was first and she just went on with the other customer.  This happens in many Filipino businesses that I enter.  And maybe someone should tell workers that being rude to \"non-kababayans\" is not a good business practice.  I will never come to this restaurant again. That being said let's talk about the food. I ordered eggplant, mungo, and rice.  It came in a combo plate.  I added a balut and Sarsi on the side.  The eggplant was way to undercooked and could not be cut with a fork and spoon.  The mungo was overly salty and watery.  It was more tubig-go than mun-go!   The best thing that I had there was the balut and the Sarsi. I would have liked to give it another chance and try their pancit and chicharon, perhaps a \"si-log\", but as I get older I no longer choose to spend money where I am treated as a second class citizen.  First impressions are so important as my life gets shorter."}
{"text":"My family and friends WILL definitely keep coming to this restaurant whenever we are in Las Vegas.  Their squid is perfectly cooked.  The adobo is as close to perfection you will ever taste.  ANOTHER big plus, their desserts are not too sweet and just right.  Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Filipino places to eat at. The Nanay that runs that place is super friendly. I'm always glad to see her when I come in. Definitely a good place to stop by if your craving Pinoy food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Place is walking distance from the MGM Grand...on the strip.  Plenty of choices to choose from..1 or 2 item combos...  I got Pork Adobo with rice.  The meat was tender...a little on the oily side tho.    There's so much food to choose from on the strip, but I had to give this place a go run.  I liked it and will return.  Plus...the lady behind the counter was nice..."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive and generous amount of al la cart items. Wide selection of snacks, candies, and pork. Hot and not to oily."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast. Wish they had bangus for breakfast"}
{"text":"I'm being gracious giving two stars. The food was expensive for being fast food buffet style. The Adobo chicken did not taste like Adobo at all, just plain chicken stew. The Pancit had no taste at all. Very disappointing. Probably the worst Filipino food I ever had.  Not going back ever. Sorry."}
